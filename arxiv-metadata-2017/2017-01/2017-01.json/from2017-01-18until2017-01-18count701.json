the three compact\nHII regions G48.9-0.3, G49.0-0.3, and G49.2-0.3 in the active star-forming\nregion W51B. The star clusters inside the three compact HII regions show the\nexcess number of stars in the J-Ks histograms compared with reference fields.\nWhile the mean color excess ratio E(J-H)/E(H-Ks) of the three compact HII\nregions are similar to ~ 2.07, the visual extinctions toward them are somewhat\ndifferent: ~ 17 mag for G48.9-0.3 and G49.0-0.3; ~ 23 mag for G49.2-0.3. Based\non their sizes and brightnesses, we suggest that the age of each compact HII\nregion is =< 2 Myr. The inferred total stellar mass, ~ 1.4 x 10^4 M_sun, of\nW51B makes it one of the most active star forming regions in the Galaxy with\nthe star formation efficiency of ~ 10 %.\n", "  A charge injection technique is applied to the X-ray CCD camera, XIS (X-ray\nImaging Spectrometer) onboard Suzaku. The charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) in\neach CCD column (vertical transfer channel) is measured by the injection of\ncharge packets into a transfer channel and subsequent readout. This paper\nreports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground\nexperiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the\nXIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the\ndispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to\nthe X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than\nthat of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The\namount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured\nwith the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the\ncalibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique\ncan accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the\ncalibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration\nsource spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with a\ncolumn-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average at\nthe time of one year after the launch). In addition, this method significantly\nreduces the low energy tail in the line profile of the calibration source\nspectrum.\n", "  We present an analysis of a Suzaku observation of the link region between the\ngalaxy clusters A399 and A401. We obtained the metallicity of the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) up to the cluster virial radii for the first time. We determine\nthe metallicity where the virial radii of the two clusters cross each other (~2\nMpc away from their centers) and found that it is comparable to that in their\ninner regions (~0.2 Zsun). It is unlikely that the uniformity of metallicity up\nto the virial radii is due to mixing caused by a cluster collision. Since the\nram-pressure is too small to strip the interstellar medium of galaxies around\nthe virial radius of a cluster, the fairly high metallicity that we found there\nindicates that the metals in the ICM are not transported from member galaxies\nby ram-pressure stripping. Instead, the uniformity suggests that the\nproto-cluster region was extensively polluted with metals by extremely powerful\noutflows (superwinds) from galaxies before the clusters formed. We also\nsearched for the oxygen emission from the warm--hot intergalactic medium in\nthat region and obtained a strict upper limit of the hydrogen density\n(nH<4.1x10^-5 cm^-3).\n", "  We report the detection of a transient X-ray source toward the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) using the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) onboard the\nSuzaku telescope. The source was detected at the edge of the XIS image during a\nroutine observation of the calibration source 1E 0102.2-7219, a supernova\nremnant in the SMC. We constrained the source position using ray-tracing\nsimulations. No such transient source was found at the position in the other\nSuzaku observations nor in all the available archived images of other X-ray\nmissions for the last ~28 years. The XIS spectrum can be explained by a single\nblackbody with a temperature of ~72 eV, and an interstellar extinction of\n~4.9x10^{20} H atoms cm^{-2} consistent with the value to the SMC. An\nadditional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably\ndue to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions. Assuming that the source is\nat the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is\n~10^{37} erg s^{-1} and the radius of the source is ~10^{8} cm. The XIS light\ncurve shows about a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks\nobservation. Together with the archived data, the X-ray flux in the burst is at\nleast three orders of magnitude brighter than the undetected quiescent level.\nAll these properties are often seen among supersoft sources (SSSs). We conclude\nthat the transient source is another example of SSS in the SMC.\n", "  We report on observations of SN 1006 with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometers\n(XIS) on board Suzaku. We firmly detected K-shell emission from Fe, for the\nfirst time, and find that the Fe ionization state is quite low. The broad band\nspectrum extracted from the southeast of the remnant is well fitted with a\nmodel consisting of three optically thin thermal non-equilibrium ionization\nplasmas and a power-law component. Two of the thermal models are highly\noverabundant in heavy elements and, hence, are likely due to ejecta. These\ncomponents have different ionization parameters: $n_et \\sim 1.4\\times 10^{10}$\ncm$^{-3}$ s and $n_et \\sim 7.7\\times 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ s and it is the later one\nthat produces the Fe-K emission. This suggests that Fe has been heated by the\nreverse shock more recently than the other elements, consistent with a picture\nwhere the ejecta are stratified by composition with Fe in the interior. On the\nother hand, the third thermal component is assumed to be solar abundance, and\nwe associate it with emission from the interstellar medium (ISM). The electron\ntemperature and ionization parameter are $kT_e \\sim $0.5 keV and $n_et \\sim\n5.8\\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ s. The electron temperature is lower than that\nexpected from the shock velocity which suggests a lack of collisionless\nelectron heating at the forward shock. The extremely low ionization parameter\nand extreme non-equilibrium state are due to the low density of the ambient\nmedium.\n", "  We obtained a wide-band spectrum of the Compton-thick Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3\nwith Suzaku. The observed spectrum was clearly resolved into weak, soft\npower-law emission, a heavily absorbed power-law component, cold reflection,\nand many emission lines. The heavily absorbed component, absorbed by gas with a\ncolumn density of 1.1x10^24 cm^-2, has an intrinsic 2--10 keV luminosity of\n~1.6x10^43 erg s^-1, and is considered to be direct emission from the Mrk 3\nnucleus. The reflection component was interpreted as reflection of the direct\nlight off cold, thick material; the reflection fraction $R$ was 1.36+/-0.20.\nThe cold material is inferred to be located > 1 pc from the central black hole\nof Mrk 3 due to the low ionization parameter of iron (xi < 1 erg cm s^-1) and\nthe narrow iron line width (s < 22 eV). A Compton shoulder to the iron line was\ndetected, but the intensity of the shoulder component was less than that\nexpected from spherically distributed Compton-thick material. The weak, soft\npower-law emission is considered to be scattered light by ionized gas. The\nexistence of many highly-ionized lines from O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, and Fe in the\nobserved spectrum indicates that the ionized gas has a broad ionized structure,\nwith xi=10--1000. The scattering fraction with respect to the direct light was\nestimated to be 0.9+/-0.2%, which indicates that the column density of the\nscattering region is about 3.6x10^22 cm^-2. This high-quality spectrum obtained\nby Suzaku can be considered a template for studies of Seyfert 2 galaxies.\n", "  The Weyl curvature includes the Newtonian field and an additional field, the\nso-called anti-Newtonian. In this paper, we use the Bianchi and Ricci\nidentities to provide a set of constraints and propagations for the Weyl\nfields. The temporal evolutions of propagations manifest explicit solutions of\ngravitational waves. We see that models with purely Newtonian field are\ninconsistent with relativistic models and obstruct sounding solutions.\nTherefore, both fields are necessary for the nonlocal nature and radiative\nsolutions of gravitation.\n", "  The Galactic black-hole binary GRO J1655$-$40 was observed with Suzaku on\n2005 September 22--23, for a net exposure of 35 ks with the X-ray Imaging\nSpectrometer (XIS) and 20 ks with the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD). The source was\ndetected over a broad and continuous energy range of 0.7--300 keV, with an\nintensity of $\\sim$50 mCrab at 20 keV. At a distance of 3.2 kpc, the 0.7--300\nkeV luminosity is $ \\sim 5.1 \\times 10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\\sim 0.7$ % of the\nEddington luminosity for a 6 $M_{\\odot}$ black hole). The source was in a\ntypical low/hard state, exhibiting a power-law shaped continuum with a photon\nindex of $\\sim 1.6$. During the observation, the source intensity gradually\ndecreased by 25% at energies above $\\sim 3$ keV, and by 35% below 2 keV. This,\ntogether with the soft X-ray spectra taken with the XIS, suggests the presence\nof an independent soft component that can be represented by emission from a\ncool ($\\sim 0.2$ keV) disk. The hard X-ray spectra obtained with the HXD reveal\na high-energy spectral cutoff, with an e-folding energy of $\\sim 200$ keV.\nSince the spectral photon index above 10 keV is harder by $\\sim 0.4$ than that\nobserved in the softer energy band, and the e-folding energy is higher than\nthose of typical reflection humps, the entire 0.7--300 keV spectrum cannot be\nreproduced by a single thermal Comptonization model, even considering\nreflection effects. Instead, the spectrum (except the soft excess) can be\nsuccessfully explained by invoking two thermal-Comptonization components with\ndifferent $y$-parameters. In contrast to the high/soft state spectra of this\nobject in which narrow iron absorption lines are detected with equivalent\nwidths of 60--100 eV, the present XIS spectra bear no such features beyond an\nupper-limit equivalent width of 25 eV.\n", "  We present the results of a Suzaku spectroscopic study of the soft extended\nX-ray emission in the HII region M17. The spectrum of the extended emission was\nobtained with a high signal-to-noise ratio in a spatially-resolved manner using\nthe X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS). We established that the contamination by\nunresolved point sources, the Galactic Ridge X-ray emission, the cosmic X-ray\nbackground, and the local hot bubble emission is negligible in the\nbackground-subtracted XIS spectrum of the diffuse emission. Half a dozen of\nemission lines were resolved clearly for the first time, including K lines of\nhighly ionized O, Ne, and Mg as well as L series complex of Fe at 0.5--1.5 keV.\nBased on the diagnosis of these lines, we obtained the following results: (1)\nthe extended emission is an optically-thin thermal plasma represented well by a\nsingle temperature of 3.0 +/- 0.4 MK, (2) the abundances of elements with\nemission lines in the diffuse spectrum are 0.1--0.3 solar, while those of\nbright discrete sources are 0.3--1.5 solar, (3) the metal abundances relative\nto each other in the diffuse emission are consistent with solar except for a Ne\nenhancement of a factor of 2, (4) both the plasma temperature and the chemical\ncomposition of the diffuse emission show no spatial variation across the\nstudied spatial scale of about 5 pc.\n", "  We carried out 3 observations of the cluster of galaxies AWM 7, for the\ncentral region and 20'-east and 20'-west offset regions, with Suzaku.\nTemperature and abundance profiles are measured out to 27'~ 570 /h_70 kpc,\nwhich corresponded to ~0.35 r_180. The temperature of the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) slightly decreases from 3.8 keV at the center to 3.4 keV in ~0.35 r_180\nregion, indicating a flatter profile than those in other nearby clusters.\nAbundance ratio of Si to Fe is almost constant in our observation, while Mg to\nFe ratio increases with radius from the cluster center. O to Fe ratio in the\nwest region shows increase with radius, while that in the east region is almost\nflat, though the errors are relatively large. These features suggest that the\nenrichment process is significantly different between products of type II\nsupernovae (O and Mg) and those by type Ia supernovae (Si and Fe). We also\nexamined positional shift of the central energy of He-like Fe-Ka line, in\nsearch of possible rotation of the ICM. The 90% upper limit for the\nline-of-sight velocity difference was derived to be v ~ 2000 km/s, suggesting\nthat the ellipticity of AWM 7 is rather caused by a recent directional infall\nof the gas along the large-scale filament.\n", "  We report on the wide band spectra of SN 1006 as observed by Suzaku. Thermal\nand nonthermal emission are successfully resolved thanks to the excellent\nspectral response of Suzaku's X-ray CCD XIS. The nonthermal emission cannot be\nreproduced by a simple power-law model but needs a roll-off at 5.7$\\times\n10^{16}$ Hz = 0.23 keV. The roll-off frequency is significantly higher in the\nnortheastern rim than in the southwestern rim. We also have placed the most\nstringent upper limit of the flux above 10 keV using the Hard X-ray Detector.\n", "  Suzaku observed a nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC4945, which hosts one of the\nbrightest active galactic nuclei above 20 keV. Combining data from the X-ray\nCCD camera (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), the AGN intrinsic nuclear\nemission and its reprocessed signals were observed simultaneously. The\nintrinsic emission is highly obscured with an absorbing column of $\\sim 5\n\\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and was detectable only above $\\sim 10$ keV. The\nspectrum below 10 keV is dominated by reflection continuum and emission lines\nfrom neutral/ionized material. Along with a neutral iron K$\\alpha$ line, a\nneutral iron K$\\beta$ and a neutral nickel K$\\alpha$ line were detected for the\nfirst time from this source. The neutral lines and the cold reflection\ncontinuum are consistent with both originating in the same location. The\nCompton down-scattered shoulder in the neutral Fe-K$\\alpha$ line is $\\sim 10%$\nin flux of the narrow core, which confirms that the line originates from\nreflection rather than transmission. The weakness of the Compton shoulder also\nindicates that the reflector is probably seen nearly edge-on. Flux of the\nintrinsic emission varied by a factor of $\\sim 2$ within $\\sim 20$ ks, which\nrequires the obscuring material to be geometrically thin. Broadband spectral\nmodeling showed that the solid angle of the neutral reflector is less than a\nfew $\\times 10^{-2} \\times 2\\pi$. All this evidence regarding the reprocessed\nsignals suggests that a disk-like absorber/reflector is viewed from a near\nedge-on angle.\n", "  This paper reports the discovery of a bright X-ray transient source, Suzaku\nJ1305-4913, in the south-west arm of the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 4945. It\nwas detected at a 0.5 -- 10 keV flux of $2.2 \\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ during the Suzaku observation conducted on 2006 January 15 -- 17, but\nwas undetectable in a shorter observation on 2005 August 22 --23, with an upper\nlimit of $1.7 \\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (90% confidence level).\nAt a distance of 3.7 Mpc, the bolometric luminosity of the source becomes\n$L_{\\rm bol} = 4.4 \\times 10^{39} \\alpha$ erg s$^{-1}$, where $\\alpha = (\\cos\n60^\\circ / \\cos i)$ and $i$ is the disk inclination. Therefore, the source is\nclassified into so-called ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The time-averaged\nX-ray spectrum of the source is described by a multi-color disk model, with the\ninnermost accretion disk temperature of $T_{\\rm in} = 1.69_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$\nkeV. During the 2006 January observation, it varied by a factor of 2 in\nintensity, following a clear correlation of $L_{\\rm bol} \\propto T_{\\rm in}^4$.\nIt is inferred that the innermost disk radius $R_{\\rm in}$ stayed constant at\n$R_{\\rm in} = 79_{-3.9}^{+4.0} \\alpha^{1/2}$ km, suggesting the presence of a\nstandard accretion disk. Relating $R_{\\rm in}$ with the last stable orbit\naround a non-rotating black hole yields a rather low black hole mass, $\\sim 9\n\\alpha^{1/2}$ solar masses, which would imply that the source is shining at a\nluminosity of $\\sim3 \\alpha^{1/2} $ times the Eddington limit. These results\ncan be better interpreted by invoking sub-Eddington emission from a rapidly\nspinning black hole with a mass of 20 -- 130 solar masses.\n", "  We report on results from Suzaku broadband X-ray observations of the\nsouthwest part of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 with an\nenergy coverage of 0.4-40 keV. The X-ray spectrum, presumably of synchrotron\norigin, is known to be completely lineless, making this SNR ideally suited for\na detailed study of the X-ray spectral shape formed through efficient particle\nacceleration at high speed shocks. With a sensitive hard X-ray measurement from\nthe HXD PIN on board Suzaku, we determine the hard X-ray spectrum in the 12--40\nkeV range to be described by a power law with photon index Gamma = 3.2+/- 0.2,\nsignificantly steeper than the soft X-ray index of Gamma = 2.4+/- 0.05 measured\npreviously with ASCA and other missions. We find that a simple power law fails\nto describe the full spectral range of 0.4-40 keV and instead a power-law with\nan exponential cutoff with hard index Gamma = 1.50+/- 0.09 and high-energy\ncutoff epsilon_c = 1.2+/- 0.3 keV formally provides an excellent fit over the\nfull bandpass. If we use the so-called SRCUT model, as an alternative model, it\ngives the best-fit rolloff energy of epsilon_{roll} = 0.95+/- 0.04 keV.\nTogether with the TeV gamma-ray spectrum ranging from 0.3 to 100 TeV obtained\nrecently by HESS observations, our Suzaku observations of RX J1713.7-3946\nprovide stringent constraints on the highest energy particles accelerated in a\nsupernova shock.\n", "  The accretion-powered pulsar Her X-1 was observed with Suzaku twice in its\nmain-on state, on 2005 October 5-6 and 2006 March 29-30, for a net exposure of\n30.5 ks and 34.4 ks, respectively. In the 2005 and 2006 observations, the\nsource was detected at an average 10-30 keV intensity of 290 mCrab and 230\nmCrab, respectively. The intrinsic pulse period was measured on both occasions\nat 1.23776 s by HXD-PIN, after barycentric and binary corrections. The pulse\nphase-averaged spectra in the energy range above 10 keV are well fitted by\n``Negative and Positive power-law times EXponential (NPEX)'' model, multiplied\nby a fundamental cyclotron resonance scattering feature at ~36 keV which\nappears very significantly in the HXD-PIN data. The resonance profiles were\nreproduced successfully by the Lorentzian type scattering cross section, rather\nthan by a Gaussian type alternative. The pulse phase-averaged HXD-GSO data,\ncovering 50-120 keV, are featureless. However, in a differential spectrum\nbetween the pulse-decay phase and off-pulse phase, the second harmonic\ncyclotron resonance was detected in the GSO data at ~73 keV, with a depth of\n1.6_-0.7^+0.9. This makes Her X-1 a 6th pulsar with established second harmonic\nresonance. Implications of these results are briefly discussed.\n", "  We observed with Suzaku the symbiotic star SS73 17, motivated by the\ndiscovery by the INTEGRAL satellite and the Swift BAT survey that it emits hard\nX-rays. Our observations showed a highly-absorbed X-ray spectrum with NH >\n10^23 cm-2, equivalent to A_V > 26, although the source has B magnitude 11.3\nand is also bright in UV. The source also shows strong, narrow iron lines\nincluding fluorescent Fe K as well as Fe xxv and Fe xxvi. The X-ray spectrum\ncan be fit with a thermal model including an absorption component that\npartially covers the source. Most of the equivalent width of the iron\nfluorescent line in this model can be explained as a combination of\nreprocessing in a dense absorber plus reflection off a white dwarf surface, but\nit is likely that the continuum is partially seen in reflection as well. Unlike\nother symbiotic systems that show hard X-ray emission (CH Cyg, RT Cru, T CrB,\nGX1+4), SS73 17 is not known to have shown nova-like optical variability, X-ray\nflashes, or pulsations, and has always shown faint soft X-ray emission. As a\nresult, although it is likely a white dwarf, the nature of the compact object\nin SS73 17 is still uncertain. SS73 17 is probably an extreme example of the\nrecently discovered and relatively small class of hard X-ray emitting symbiotic\nsystems.\n", "  We present observations of the North Polar Spur (NPS) using the X-ray Imaging\nSpectrometer (XIS) aboard the Suzaku X-ray satellite. The NPS is a large region\nof enhanced soft X-ray and radio emission projected above the plane of the\nGalaxy, likely produced by a series of supernovae and stellar winds from the\nnearby Sco-Cen OB association. The exceptional sensitivity and spectral\nresolution of the XIS below 1 keV allow unprecedented probing of low-energy\nspectral lines, including CVI (0.37 keV) and NVII (0.50 keV), and we have\ndetected highly-ionized nitrogen toward the NPS for the first time. For this\nsingle pointing toward the brightest 3/4 keV emission (l = 26.8 deg, b = +22.0\ndeg), the best-fit NPS emission model implies a hot (kT ~ 0.3 keV), collisional\nionization equilibrium (CIE) plasma with depleted C, O, Ne, Mg, and Fe\nabundances of less than 0.5 solar, but an enhanced N abundance, with N/O = 4.0\n+0.4,-0.5 times solar. The temperature and total thermal energy of the gas\nsuggest heating by one or more supernovae, while the enhanced nitrogen\nabundance is best explained by enrichment from stellar material that has been\nprocessed by the CNO cycle. Due to the time required to develop AGB stars, we\nconclude that this N/O enhancement cannot be caused by the Sco-Cen OB\nassociation, but may result from a previous enrichment episode in the solar\nneighborhood.\n", "  Five on-plane regions within +/- 0.8deg of the Galactic center were observed\nwith the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) and the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS)\nonboard Suzaku. From all regions, significant hard X-ray emission was detected\nwith HXD-PIN up to 40 keV, in addition to the extended plasma emission which is\ndominant in the XIS band. The hard X-ray signals are inferred to come primarily\nfrom a spatially extended source, rather than from a small number of bright\ndiscrete objects. Contributions to the HXD data from catalogued X-ray sources,\ntypically brighter than 1 mCrab, were estimated and removed using information\nfrom Suzaku and other satellites. Even after this removal, the hard X-ray\nsignals remained significant, exhibiting a typical 12--40 keV surface\nbrightness of 4E-10 erg cm-2 s-1 deg-2 and power-law-like spectra with a photon\nindex of 1.8. Combined fittings to the XIS and HXD-PIN spectra confirm that a\nseparate hard tail component is superposed onto the hot thermal emission,\nconfirming a previous report based on the XIS data. Over the 5--40 keV band,\nthe hard tail is spectrally approximated by a power law of photon index ~2, but\nbetter by those with somewhat convex shapes. Possible origins of the extended\nhard X-ray emission are discussed.\n", "  This paper reports the Suzaku results on the northeast shell of RCW 86. With\nthe spatial and spectral analysis, we separated the X-rays into three distinct\ncomponents; low (kT_e~0.3keV) and high (kT_e~1.8keV) temperature plasmas and a\nnon-thermal component, and discovered their spatial distributions are different\nfrom each other. The low temperature plasma is dominated at the east rim,\nwhereas the non-thermal emission is the brightest at the northeast rim which is\nspatially connected from the east rim. The high temperature plasma, found to\ncontain the ~6.42keV line (K alpha of low-ionized iron), is enhanced at the\ninward region with respect to the east rim and has no spatial correlation with\nthe non-thermal X-ray (the northeast). The Fe-Kalpha line, therefore, is not\nrelated to the non-thermal emission but originates from Fe-rich ejecta heated\nto the high temperatures by the reverse shock. Since the metal abundances of\nthe low temperature plasma are sub-solar, the most possible origin of this\ncomponent is interstellar medium heated by a blast wave. The non-thermal X-ray,\nwhich has a power-law index of ~2.8, is likely to be synchrotron emission. A\npossible scenario to explain these morphologies and spectra is: A fast moving\nblast wave in a thin cavity of OB association collided with a dense\ninterstellar medium or cloud at the east region very recently. As the result,\nthe reverse shock in this interior decelerated, and arrived at the Fe-rich\nregion of the ejecta and heated it. In the northeast rim, on the other hand,\nthe blast wave is still moving fast, and accelerated high energy electrons to\nemit synchrotron X-rays.\n", "  We present results from a 150 ksec Suzaku observation of the Seyfert 1.5 NGC\n3516 in October 2005. The source was in a relatively highly absorbed state. Our\nbest-fit model is consistent with the presence of a low-ionization absorber\nwhich has a column density near 5 * 10^{22} cm^{-2} and covers most of the\nX-ray continuum source (covering fraction 96-100%). A high-ionization absorbing\ncomponent, which yields a narrow absorption feature consistent with Fe K XXVI,\nis confirmed. A relativistically broadened Fe K alpha line is required in all\nfits, even after the complex absorption is taken into account; an additional\npartial-covering component is an inadequate substitute for the continuum\ncurvature associated with the broad Fe line. A narrow Fe K alpha emission line\nhas a velocity width consistent with the Broad Line Region. The low-ionization\nabsorber may be responsible for producing the narrow Fe K alpha line, though a\ncontribution from additional material out of the line of sight is possible. We\ninclude in our model soft band emission lines from He- and H-like ions of N, O,\nNe and Mg, consistent with photo-ionization, though a small contribution from\ncollisionally-ionized emission is possible.\n", "  We report a serendipitous detection of an intense X-ray flare from the Tycho\nreference source HD 161084 during a Suzaku observation of the Galactic Center\nregion for 20 ks. The X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) recorded a flare from\nthis A1-type dwarf or subgiant star with a flux of 1.4x10^{-12} erg s^{-1}\ncm^{-2} (0.5--10 keV) and a decay time scale of 0.5 hr. The spectrum is hard\nwith a prominent Fe XXV K alpha emission line at 6.7 keV, which is explained by\na 5 keV thin-thermal plasma model attenuated by a 1.4x10^{21} cm^{-2}\nextinction. The low extinction, which is consistent with the optical reddening,\nindicates that the source is a foreground star toward the Galactic Center\nregion. Based on the spectroscopic parallax distance of 530 pc, the peak X-ray\nluminosity amounts to 1x10^{32} erg s^{-1} (0.5--10 keV). This is much larger\nthan the X-ray luminosity of ordinary late-type main-sequence stars, and the\nX-ray emission is unattributable to a hidden late-type companion that comprises\na wide binary system with the A-star. We discuss possible natures of HD 161084\nand suggest that it is most likely an interacting binary with elevated magnetic\nactivity in the companion such as the Algol-type system. The flux detected by\nSuzaku during the burst is 100 times larger than the quiescent level measured\nusing the archived XMM-Newton and Chandra data. The large flux amplification\nmakes this star a unique example among sources of this class.\n", "  We present results of 120 ks observation of a compact group of galaxies\nHCG~62 ($z=0.0145$) with Suzaku XIS and HXD-PIN\\@. The XIS spectra for four\nannular regions were fitted with two temperature {\\it vapec} model with\nvariable abundance, combined with the foreground Galactic component. The\nGalactic component was constrained to have a common surface brightness among\nthe four annuli, and two temperature {\\it apec} model was preferred to single\ntemperature model. We confirmed the multi-temperature nature of the intra-group\nmedium reported with Chandra and XMM-Newton, with a doughnut-like high\ntemperature ring at radii 3.3--6.5$'$ in a hardness image. We found Mg, Si, S,\nand Fe abundances to be fairly robust. We examined the possible\n``high-abundance arc'' at $\\sim 2'$ southwest from the center, however Suzaku\ndata did not confirm it. We suspect that it is a misidentification of an excess\nhot component in this region as the Fe line. Careful background study showed no\npositive detection of the extended hard X-rays previously reported with ASCA,\nin 5--12 keV with XIS and 12--40 keV with HXD-PIN, although our upper limit did\nnot exclude the ASCA result. There is an indication that the X-ray intensity in\n$r<3.3'$ region is $70\\pm 19$% higher than the nominal CXB level (5--12 keV),\nand Chandra and Suzaku data suggest that most of this excess could be due to\nconcentration of hard X-ray sources with an average photon index of\n$\\Gamma=1.38\\pm 0.06$. Cumulative mass of O, Fe and Mg in the group gas and the\nmetal mass-to-light ratio were derived and compared with those in other groups.\nPossible role of AGN or galaxy mergers in this group is also discussed.\n", "  The hard X-ray detector (HXD) on board the X-ray satellite Suzaku is designed\nto have a good timing capability with a 61 $\\mu$s time resolution. In addition\nto detailed descriptions of the HXD timing system, results of in-orbit timing\ncalibration and performance of the HXD are summarized. The relative accuracy of\ntime measurements of the HXD event was confirmed to have an accuracy of\n$1.9\\times 10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$ per day, and the absolute timing was confirmed\nto be accurate to 360 $\\mu$s or better. The results were achieved mainly\nthrough observations of the Crab pulsar, including simultaneous ones with RXTE,\nINTEGRAL, and Swift.\n", "  A time-variability study of the neutral iron line flux at 6.40keV in the Sgr\nB2 region from data of Suzaku and Chandra is presented. The highly ionized iron\nline at 6.68keV is due to Galactic Center Diffuse X-rays (GCDX), and is thus\ntime invariable. By comparing the 6.68keV and 6.40keV line fluxes, we found\nthat the 6.40keV flux from the SgrB2 complex region is time variable;\nparticularly the giant molecular cloud M0.66-0.02, known as ``Sgr B2 cloud'' is\nhighly variable. The variability of the 6.40keV line in intensity and spatial\ndistribution strongly supports the scenario that the molecular clouds in the\nSgrB2 region are X-ray Reflection Nebulae irradiated by the Galactic Center\n(GC) black hole Sgr A*.\n", "  We have observed a typical Galactic plane field at (l,b) = (28.46d, -0.20d)\nwith Suzaku for 100 ksec to carry out a precise spectral study of the Galactic\nRidge X-ray Emission (GRXE). The field is known to be devoid of X-ray point\nsources brighter than ~2 x 10^{-13} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} (2--10 keV), and\nalready deeply observed with Chandra. Thanks to the low and stable background\nand high spectral resolution of Suzaku, we were able to resolve, for the first\ntime, three narrow iron K-emission lines from low-ionized (6.41 keV),\nhelium-like (6.67 keV), and hydrogenic ions (7.00 keV) in the GRXE spectrum.\nThese line features constrain the GRXE emission mechanisms: The cosmic-ray ion\ncharge exchange model or the non-equilibrium ionization plasma model are\nunlikely, since they require either broad emission lines or lines at\nintermediate ionization states. Collisional ionization equilibrium plasma is\nthe likely origin for the 6.67 keV and 7.00 keV lines, while origin of the 6.41\nkeV line, which is due to fluorescence from cold material, is not elucidated.\nLow non-X-ray background and little stray-light contamination of Suzaku allowed\nus to precisely measure the absolute X-ray surface brightness in the direction\nof the Galactic plane. Excluding the point sources brighter than ~2 x 10^{-13}\nergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} (2--10 keV), the total surface brightness on the Galactic\nplane is ~6.1 x 10^{-11} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} deg^{-2} (2--10 keV), including\nthe contribution of the cosmic X-ray background that is estimated to be ~1.3x\n10^{-11} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} deg^{-2}.\n", "  We present the results of a Suzaku study of a bright point-like source in the\n6.7 keV intensity map of the Galactic center region. We detected an intense\nFeXXV 6.7 keV line with an equivalent width of ~1 keV as well as emission lines\nof highly ionized Ar and Ca from a spectrum obtained by the X-ray Imaging\nSpectrometer. The overall spectrum is described very well by a heavily absorbed\n(~2x10^{23}cm^{-2}) thin thermal plasma model with a temperature of 3.8+/-0.6\nkeV and a luminosity of ~3x10^{34} erg s^{-1} (2.0--8.0 keV) at 8 kpc. The\nabsorption, temperature, luminosity, and the 6.7 keV line intensity were\nconfirmed with the archived XMM-Newton data. The source has a very red\n(J-Ks=8.2 mag) infrared spectral energy distribution (SED), which was fitted by\na blackbody emission of ~1000 K attenuated by a visual extinction of ~31 mag.\nThe high plasma temperature and the large X-ray luminosity are consistent with\na wind-wind colliding Wolf-Rayet binary. The similarity of the SED to those of\nthe eponymous Quintuplet cluster members suggests that the source is a WC-type\nsource.\n", "  We report the Suzaku results of HESS J1614-518, which is the brightest\nextended TeV gamma-ray source discovered in the Galactic plane survey conducted\nusing the H.E.S.S. telescope. We discovered three X-ray objects in the field of\nview of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS), which were designated as Suzaku\nJ1614-5141 (src A), Suzaku J1614-5152 (src B), and Suzaku J1614-5148 (src C).\nSrc A is an extended source located at the peak position of HESS J1614-518, and\ntherefore it is a plausible counterpart to HESS J1614-518. The X-ray flux in\nthe 2-10 keV band is 5e-13 erg/s/cm^2, which is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the TeV flux. The photon index is 1.7, which is smaller than the canonical\nvalue of synchrotron emissions from high-energy electrons found in some\nsupernova remnants. These findings present a challenge to models in which the\norigin of the TeV emission is the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic\nmicrowave background by accelerated electrons that emit X-rays via synchrotron\nemission. Src B is located at a relatively dim region in the TeV band image;\nhowever, its hydrogen column density is the same as that of src A. Therefore,\nsrc B may also be physically related to HESS J1614-518. Src C is a foreground\nlate-type B star. We also discovered a soft extended X-ray emission near HESS\nJ1614-518.\n", "  We made a 100 ks observation of the Sagittarius (Sgr) B1 region at (l, b) =\n(0.5, -0.1) near to the Galactic center (GC) with the Suzaku/XIS. Emission\nlines of S XV, Fe I, Fe XXV, and Fe XXVI were clearly detected in the spectrum.\nWe found that the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI line emissions smoothly distribute over\nthe Sgr B1 and B2 regions connecting from the GC. This result suggests that the\nGC hot plasma extends at least up to the Sgr B region with a constant\ntemperature. There are two diffuse X-ray sources in the observed region. One of\nthe two (G0.42-0.04) is newly discovered, and exhibits a strong S XV Ka\nemission line, suggesting a candidate for a supernova remnant located in the GC\nregion. The other one (M0.51-0.10), having a prominent Fe I Ka emission line\nand a strongly absorbed continuum, is likely to be an X-ray reflection nebula.\nThere is no near source bright enough to irradiate M0.51-0.10. However, the Fe\nI Ka emission can be explained if Sgr A* was ~ 10^6 times brighter 300 years\nago, the light travel time for 100 pc to M0.51-0.10, than it is at present.\n", "  A new type of object called \"Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs)\" has been\ndiscovered by the Spitzer Space Telescope. VeLLOs might be substellar objects\nforming by accretion. However, some VeLLOs are associated with strong outflows,\nindicating the previous existence of massive accretion. The thermal history,\nwhich significantly affects the chemistry, between substellar objects with a\ncontinuous low accretion rate and objects in a quiescent phase after massive\naccretion (outburst) must be greatly different. In this study, the chemical\nevolution has been calculated in an episodic accretion model to show that CO\nand N2H+ have a relation different from starless cores or Class 0/I objects.\nFurthermore, the CO2 ice feature at 15.2 micron will be a good tracer of the\nthermal process in VeLLOs.\n", "  We have performed a joint analysis of prompt emission from four bright short\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the Suzaku-WAM and the Konus-Wind experiments.\nThis joint analysis allows us to investigate the spectral properties of\nshort-duration bursts over a wider energy band with a higher accuracy. We find\nthat these bursts have a high E$_{\\rm peak}$, around 1 MeV and have a harder\npower-law component than that of long GRBs. However, we can not determine\nwhether these spectra follow the cut-off power-law model or the Band model. We\nalso investigated the spectral lag, hardness ratio, inferred isotropic\nradiation energy and existence of a soft emission hump, in order to classify\nthem into short or long GRBs using several criteria, in addition to the burst\nduration. We find that all criteria, except for the existence of the soft hump,\nsupport the fact that our four GRB samples are correctly classified as\nbelonging to the short class. In addition, our broad-band analysis revealed\nthat there is no evidence of GRBs with a very large hardness ratio, as seen in\nthe BATSE short GRB sample, and that the spectral lag of our four short GRBs is\nconsistent with zero, even in the MeV energy band, unlike long GRBs. Although\nour short GRB samples are still limited, these results suggest that the\nspectral hardness of short GRBs might not differ significantly from that of\nlong GRBs, and also that the spectral lag at high energies could be a strong\ncriterion for burst classification.\n", "  Recently, de Visser and Blaauboer [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 96}, 246801 (2006)]\nproposed the most efficient deterministic teleportation protocol $\\cal T$ for\nelectron spins in a semiconductor nanostructure consisting of a single and a\ndouble quantum dot. However, it is as yet unknown if $\\cal T$ can be completed\nbefore decoherence sets in. In this paper we analyze the detrimental effect of\nnuclear spin baths, the main source of decoherence, on $\\cal T$. We show that\nnonclassical teleportation fidelity can be achieved with $\\cal T$ provided\ncertain conditions are met. Our study indicates that realization of quantum\ncomputation with quantum dots is indeed promising.\n", "  We observed a linearly sliced area of the Cygnus Loop from the north-east to\nthe south-west with Suzaku in seven pointings. After dividing the entire fields\nof view (FOV) into 119 cells, we extracted spectra from all of the cells and\nperformed spectral analysis for them. We then applied both one- and\ntwo-component non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models for all of the spectra,\nfinding that almost all were significantly better fitted by the two-component\nNEI model rather than the one-component NEI model. Judging from the abundances,\nthe high-kT_e component must be the ejecta component, while the low-kT_e\ncomponent comes from the swept-up matter. Therefore, the ejecta turn out to be\ndistributed inside a large area (at least our FOV) of the Cygnus Loop. We\ndivided the entire FOV into northern and southern parts, and found that the\nejecta distributions were asymmetric to the geometric center: the ejecta of Si,\nS, and Fe seem to be distributed more in the south than in the north of the\nCygnus Loop by a factor of about 2. The degree of ejecta-asymmetry is\nconsistent with that expected by recent supernova explosion models.\n", "  We present the results of a spatially resolved spectral analysis from four\nSuzaku observations covering the northeastern rim of the Cygnus Loop. A\ntwo-kT_e non-ionization equilibrium (NEI) model fairly well represents our\ndata, which confirms the NEI condition of the plasma there. The metal\nabundances are depleted relative to the solar values almost everywhere in our\nfield of view. We find abundance inhomogeneities across the field: the\nnorthernmost region (Region A) has enhanced absolute abundances compared with\nother regions. In addition, the relative abundances of Mg/O and Fe/O in Region\nA are lower than the solar values, while those in the other regions are twice\nhigher than the solar values. As far as we are concerned, neither a\ncircumstellar medium, fragments of ejecta, nor abundance inhomogeneities of the\nlocal interstellar medium around the Cygnus Loop can explain the relatively\nenhanced abundance in Region A. This point is left as an open question for\nfuture work.\n", "  One of the advantages of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) system on board\nSuzaku is its low and stable non-X-ray background (NXB). In order to make the\nbest use of this advantage, modeling the NXB spectra with high accuracy is\nimportant to subtract them from the spectra of on-source observations. We\nconstruct an NXB database by collecting XIS events when the dark Earth covers\nthe XIS FOV. The total exposure time of the NXB data is about 785 ks for each\nXIS. It is found that the count rate of the NXB anti-correlates with the\ncut-off-rigidity and correlates with the count rate of the PIN upper\ndiscriminator (PIN-UD) in Hard X-ray Detector on board Suzaku. We thus model\nthe NXB spectrum for a given on-source observation by employing either of these\nparameters and obtain a better reproducibility of the NXB for the model with\nPIN-UD than that with the cut-off-rigidity. The reproducibility of the NXB\nmodel with PIN-UD is 4.55-5.63% for each XIS NXB in the 1-7 keV band and\n2.79-4.36% for each XIS NXB in the 5-12 keV band for each 5 ks exposure of the\nNXB data. This NXB reproducibility is much smaller than the spatial fluctuation\nof the cosmic X-ray background in the 1-7 keV band, and is almost comparable to\nthat in the 5-12 keV band.\n", "  We present an empirical correction of sky coordinates of X-ray photons\nobtained with the XIS aboard the Suzaku satellite to improve the source\nposition accuracy and restore the point-spread function (PSF). The XIS images\nare known to have an uncertainty in position of up to 1 arcmin, and to show\nconsiderable degradations of the PSF. These problems are caused by a drifting\nof the satellite attitude due to thermal distortion of the side panel 7, where\nthe attitude control system is mounted. We found that the position error\naveraged over a pointing observation can be largely reduced by using the\nrelation between the deviation of the source position in the DETX direction and\nthe ecliptic latitude of the pointing target. We parameterized the wobbling of\nthe source position synchronized with the satellite orbital period with\ntemperatures of onboard radiators and elapsed time since the night-day\ntransition of the spacecraft. We developed software, aeattcor, to correct the\nimage drift using these parameters, and applied it to 27 point-source images.\nWe show that the radius of the 90% error circle of the source position was\nreduced to 19 arcsec and the PSF was sharpened. These improvements have\nenhanced the scientific capability of the Suzaku XIS.\n", "  The X-ray spectra of late type stars can generally be well fitted by a two\ntemperature component model of the corona. We fnd that the temperature of both\ncomponents are strong functions of stellar age, although the temperature of the\nhotter plasma in the corona shows a larger scatter and is probably affected by\nthe activity of stars, such as flares. We confirm the power-law decay of the\ntemperature of the hot plasma, but the temperature of the cool component decays\nlinearly with log (age).\n", "  The Fokker-Planck (FP) model is one of the commonly used methods for studies\nof the dynamical evolution of dense spherical stellar systems such as globular\nclusters and galactic nuclei. The FP model is numerically stable in most cases,\nbut we find that it encounters numerical difficulties rather often when the\neffects of tidal shocks are included in two-dimensional (energy and angular\nmomentum space) version of the FP model or when the initial condition is\nextreme (e.g., a very large cluster mass and a small cluster radius). To avoid\nsuch a problem, we have developed a new integration scheme for a\ntwo-dimensional FP equation by adopting an Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI)\nmethod given in the Douglas-Rachford split form. We find that our ADI method\nreduces the computing time by a factor of ~2 compared to the fully implicit\nmethod, and resolves problems of numerical instability.\n", "  We report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of\n45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.3 using IRC onboard\nthe AKARI satellite. This paper investigates whether the luminosities of these\nULIRGs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried AGNs\nare energetically important. Our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3\nmicron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the optical\ndepths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains and\nat 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. Because of the AKARI IRC's\nspectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffected\nby Earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ULIRGs at\nz > 0.15. We estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),\nmodestly obscured (Av < 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron PAH\nemission luminosities measured in AKARI IRC slitless spectra, and confirm that\nsuch starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ULIRGs. In roughly half\nof the observed ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts, we find signatures\nof luminous energy sources that produce no PAH emission and/or are more\ncentrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. We interpret these energy\nsources as buried AGNs. The fraction of ULIRGs with detectable buried AGN\nsignatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. Our overall results\nsupport the scenario that luminous buried AGNs are important in many ULIRGs at\nz < 0.3 classified optically as non-Seyferts, and that the optical\nundetectability of such buried AGNs occurs merely because of a large amount of\nnuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust column\ndensity opaque to the ionizing radiation of the AGNs.\n", "  We present 10' x 50' scan maps around an M supergiant Alpha Ori at 65, 90,\n140 and 160 microns obtained with the AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite.\nHigher spatial resolution data with the exact analytic solution permit us to\nfit the de-projected shape of the stellar wind bow shock around Alpha Ori to\nhave the stand-off distance of 4.8', position angle of 55 degrees and\ninclination angle of 56 degrees. The shape of the bow shock suggests that the\npeculiar velocity of Alpha Ori with respect to the local medium is v_* = 40\n(n_H)^(-1/2), where n_H is the hydrogen nucleus density at Alpha Ori. We find\nthat the local medium is of n_H = 1.5 to 1.9 cm^(-3) and the velocity of the\nlocal flow is at 11 km s^(-1) by using the most recent astrometric solutions\nfor Alpha Ori under the assumption that the local medium is moving away from\nthe Orion OB 1 association. AKARI images may also reveal a vortex ring due to\ninstabilities on the surface of the bow shock as demonstrated by numerical\nmodels. This research exemplifies the potential of AKARI All-Sky data as well\nas follow-up observations with Herschel Space Telescope and Stratospheric\nObservatory for Infrared Astronomy for this avenue of research in revealing the\nnature of interaction between the stellar wind and interstellar medium.\n", "  We observed an area of 10 deg^2 of the Large Magellanic Cloud using the\nInfrared Camera on board AKARI. The observations were carried out using five\nimaging filters (3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron) and a dispersion prism (2 -- 5\nmicron, $\\lambda / \\Delta\\lambda$ $\\sim$ 20) equipped in the IRC. This paper\ndescribes the outline of our survey project and presents some initial results\nusing the imaging data that detected over 5.9x10^5 near-infrared and 6.4x10^4\nmid-infrared point sources. The 10 $\\sigma$ detection limits of our survey are\nabout 16.5, 14.0, 12.3, 10.8, and 9.2 in Vega-magnitude at 3, 7, 11, 15, and 24\nmicron, respectively. The 11 and 15 micron data, which are unique to AKARI IRC,\nallow us to construct color-magnitude diagrams that are useful to identify\nstars with circumstellar dust. We found a new sequence in the color-magnitude\ndiagram, which is attributed to red giants with luminosity fainter than that of\nthe tip of the first red giant branch. We suggest that this sequence is likely\nto be related to the broad emission feature of aluminium oxide at 11.5 micron.\nThe 11 and 15 micron data also indicate that the ([11] - [15]) micron color of\nboth oxygen-rich and carbon-rich red giants once becomes blue and then turns\nred again in the course of their evolution, probably due to the change in the\nflux ratio of the silicate or silicon carbide emission feature at 10 or 11.3\nmicron to the 15 micron flux.\n", "  In an attempt of clarifying the connection between the photospheric abundance\nanomalies and the stellar rotation as well as of exploring the nature of\n\"normal A\" stars, the abundances of seven elements (C, O, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and\nBa) and the projected rotational velocity for 46 A-type field stars were\ndetermined by applying the spectrum-fitting method to the high-dispersion\nspectral data obtained with BOES at BOAO. We found that the peculiarities\n(underabundances of C, O, and Ca; an overabundance of Ba) seen in slow rotators\nefficiently decrease with an increase of rotation, which almost disappear at\nv_e sin i > 100 km s^-1. This further suggests that stars with sufficiently\nlarge rotational velocity may retain the original composition at the surface\nwithout being altered. Considering the subsolar tendency (by several tenths dex\nbelow) exhibited by the elemental abundances of such rapidly-rotating\n(supposedly normal) A stars, we suspect that the gas metallicity may have\ndecreased since our Sun was born, contrary to the common picture of galactic\nchemical evolution.\n", "  We report basic far-infrared (FIR) properties of eight blue compact dwarf\ngalaxies (BCDs) observed by AKARI. We measure the fluxes at the four FIS bands\n(wavelengths of 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um). Based on these fluxes, we\nestimate basic quantities about dust: dust temperature, dust mass, and total\nFIR luminosity. We find that the typical dust temperature of the BCD sample is\nsystematically higher than that of normal spiral galaxies, although there is a\nlarge variety. The interstellar radiation field estimated from the dust\ntemperature ranges up to 100 times of the Galactic value. This confirms the\nconcentrated star-forming activity in BCDs. The star formation rate can be\nevaluated from the FIR luminosity as 0.01--0.5 $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Combining\nthis quantity with gas mass taken from the literature, we estimate the gas\nconsumption timescales (gas mass divided by the star formation rate), which\nprove to span a wide range from 1 Gyr to 100 Gyr. A natural interpretation of\nthis large variety can be provided by intermittent star formation activity. We\nfinally show the relation between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity (we utilize\nour estimate of dust mass, and take other necessary quantities from the\nliterature). There is a positive correlation between dust-to-gas ratio and\nmetallicity as expected from chemical evolution models.\n", "  We report the observations of 12 globular clusters with the AKARI/FIS. Our\ngoal is to search for emission from the cold dust within clusters. We detect\ndiffuse emissions toward NGC 6402 and 2808, but the IRAS 100-micron maps show\nthe presence of strong background radiation. They are likely emitted from the\ngalactic cirrus, while we cannot rule out the possible association of a bump of\nemission with the cluster in the case of NGC 6402. We also detect 28 point-like\nsources mainly in the WIDE-S images (90 micron). At least several of them are\nnot associated with the clusters but background galaxies based on some external\ncatalogs. We present the SEDs by combining the near-and-mid infrared data\nobtained with the IRC if possible. The SEDs suggest that most of the point\nsources are background galaxies. We find one candidate of the intracluster dust\nwhich has no mid-infrared counterpart unlike the other point-like sources,\nalthough some features such as its point-like appearance should be explained\nbefore we conclude its intracluster origin. For most of the other clusters, we\nhave confirmed the lack of the intracluster dust. We evaluate upper limits of\nthe intracluster dust mass to be between 1.0E-05 and 1.0E-03 solar mass\ndepending on the dust temperature. The lifetime of the intracluster dust\ninferred from the upper limits is shorter than 5 Myr (T=70K) or 50 Myr (35K).\nSuch short lifetime indicates some mechanism(s) are at work to remove the\nintracluster dust. We also discuss its impact on the chemical evolution of\nglobular clusters.\n", "  There is a huge gap between properties of red-sequence selected massive\ngalaxy clusters at z<1 and Lyman-break selected proto-clusters at z>3. It is\nimportant to understand when and how the z>3 proto-clusters evolve into passive\nclusters at z<1.\n  We aim to fill this cluster desert by using the space-based N4(4um) imaging\nwith the AKARI. The z'-N4 color is a powerful separator of cluster galaxies at\nz>1, taking advantage of the 4000A break and the 1.6um bump. We carefully\nselected 16 promising cluster candidates at 0.9<z<1.7, which all show obvious\nover-density of galaxies and a prominent red-sequence.\n  At this redshift range, the mid-infrared S15um/S9um flux ratio is an\nextinction-free indicator of galaxy star formation activity due to the\nredshifted PAH emission lines (6.2,7.7 and 8.6um). We show statistically that\nthe cluster galaxies have a lower S15um/S9um flux ratio than field galaxies,\ni.e., cluster galaxies already have lower star-formation activity at 0.9<z<1.7,\npushing the formation epoch of these galaxy clusters to a higher redshift.\n", "  We present the near- to mid-infared study of supernova remnants (SNRs) using\nthe AKARI IRC Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC survey\nobserved about a 10 square degree area of the LMC in five bands centered at 3,\n7, 11, 15, and 24 \\micron using the Infrared Camera (IRC) aboard AKARI. The\nnumber of SNRs in the survey area is 21, which is about a half of the known LMC\nSNRs. We systematically examined the AKARI images and identified eight SNRs\nwith distinguishable infrared emission. All of them were detected at $\\gtrsim\n10$ \\micron and some at 3 and 7 \\micron, too. We present their AKARI images and\nfluxes. In the 11/15 \\micron versus 15/24 \\micron color-color diagram, the SNRs\nappear to be aligned along a modified blackbody curve, representing thermal\nemission from dust at temperatures between 90 and 190 K. There is a good\ncorrelation between the 24 \\micron and X-ray fluxes of the SNRs. It was also\nfound that there is a good correlation between the 24 \\micron and radio fluxes\neven if there is no direct physical connection between them. We considered the\norigin of the detected mid-infrared emission in individual SNRs. We conclude\nthat the mid-infrared emissions in five SNRs that show morphologies similar to\nthe X-rays are dominated by thermal emission from hot dust heated by X-ray\nemitting plasma. Their 15/24 \\micron color temperatures are generally higher\nthan the Spitzer 24/70 \\micron color temperatures, which suggests that a\nsingle-temperature dust model cannot describe the full spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the SNRs. It also implies that our understanding of the\nfull SED is essential for estimating the dust destruction rate of grains by SNR\nshocks.\n", "  We have developed an imaging Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) for\nspace-based far-infrared astronomical observations. The FTS employs a newly\ndeveloped photoconductive detector arrays with a capacitive trans-impedance\namplifier, which makes the FTS a completely unique instrument. The FTS was\ninstalled as a function of the far-infrared instrument (FIS: Far-Infrared\nSurveyor) on the Japanese astronomical satellite, AKARI, which was launched on\nFebruary 21, 2006 (UT) from the Uchinoura Space Center. The FIS-FTS had been\noperated for more than one year before liquid helium ran out on August 26,\n2007. The FIS-FTS was operated nearly six hundreds times, which corresponds to\nmore than one hundred hours of astronomical observations and almost the same\namount of time for calibrations. As expected from laboratory measurements, the\nFIS-FTS performed well and has produced a large set of astronomical data for\nvaluable objects. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that the detector transient\neffect is a considerable factor for FTSs with photoconductive detectors. In\nthis paper, the instrumentation of the FIS-FTS and interesting phenomena\nrelated to FTS using photoconductive detectors are described, and future\napplications of this kind of FTS system are discussed.\n", "  We estimate the enclosed mass profile in the central 10 pc of the Milky Way\nby analyzing the infrared photometry and the velocity observations of\ndynamically relaxed stellar population in the Galactic center. HST/NICMOS and\nGemini Adaptive Optics images in the archive are used to obtain the number\ndensity profile, and proper motion and radial velocity data were compiled from\nthe literature to find the velocity dispersion profile assuming a spherical\nsymmetry and velocity isotropy. From these data, we calculate the enclosed mass\nand density profiles in the central 10 pc of the Galaxy using the Jeans\nequation. Our improved estimates can better describe the exact evolution of the\nmolecular clouds and star clusters falling down to the Galactic center, and\nconstrain the star formation history of the inner part of the Galaxy.\n", "  We use the microlensing variability observed for eleven gravitationally\nlensed quasars to show that the accretion disk size at a rest-frame wavelength\nof 2500 Angstroms is related to the black hole mass by\nlog(R_{2500}/cm)=(15.78\\pm0.12) + (0.80\\pm0.17)\\log(M_BH/10^9M_sun). This\nscaling is consistent with the expectation from thin disk theory (R ~\nM_BH^{2/3}), but when interpreted in terms of the standard thin disk model (T ~\nR^{-3/4}), it implies that black holes radiate with very low efficiency,\nlog(eta) = -1.77\\pm0.29 + log(L/L_E) where eta=L/(Mdot*c^2). Only by making the\nmaximum reasonable shifts in the average inclination, Eddington factors and\nblack hole masses can we raise the efficiency estimate to be marginally\nconsistent with typical efficiency estimates (eta ~ 10%). With one exception,\nthese sizes are larger by a factor of ~4 than the size needed to produce the\nobserved 0.8 micron quasar flux by thermal radiation from a thin disk with the\nsame T ~ R^{-3/4} temperature profile. While scattering a significant fraction\nof the disk emission on large scales or including a large fraction of\ncontaminating line emission can reduce the size discrepancy, resolving it also\nappears to require that accretion disks have flatter temperature/surface\nbrightness profiles.\n", "  We present an analysis of interstellar H2 toward HD 37903, which is a hot, B\n1.5 V star located in the NGC 2023 reflection nebula. Meyer et al. (2001) have\nused a rich spectrum of vibrationally excited H2 observed by the HST to\ncalculate a model of the interstellar cloud toward HD 37903. We extend Mayer's\nanalysis by including the v\"=0 vibrational level observed by the FUSE\nsatellite.\n  The T01 temperature should not be interpreted as a rotational temperature,\nbut rather as a temperature of thermal equilibrium between the ortho and para\nH2. The ortho to para H2 ratio is lower for collisionally populated levels than\nfor the levels populated by fluorescence.\n  The PDR model of the cloud located in front of HD 37903 points to a gas\ntemperature Tkin=110-377 K, hydrogen density nH=1874-544 cm^-3 and the\nstar-cloud distance of 0.45 pc.\n", "  We perform kinetic simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in Type\nIa supernova remnants (SNRs) expanding into a uniform interstellar medium\n(ISM). Bohm-like diffusion assumed, and simple models for Alfvenic drift and\ndissipation are adopted. Phenomenological models for thermal leakage injection\nare considered as well. We find that the preshock gas temperature is the\nprimary parameter that governs the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and\nenergy spectrum, while the CR injection rate is a secondary parameter. For SNRs\nin the warm ISM, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the DSA is\nefficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the SN explosion energy into CRs\nand the accelerated CR spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening to\nE^{-1.6}. Such a flat source spectrum near the knee energy, however, may not be\nreconciled with the CR spectrum observed at Earth. On the other hand, SNRs in\nthe hot ISM, with an injection fraction smaller than 10^{-4}, are inefficient\naccelerators with less than 10 % of the explosion energy getting converted to\nCRs. Also the shock structure is almost test-particle like and the ensuing CR\nspectrum can be steeper than E^{-2}. With amplified magnetic field strength of\norder of 30 microG, Alfven waves generated by the streaming instability may\ndrift upstream fast enough to make the modified test-particle power-law as\nsteep as E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR spectrum.\n", "  The turbulent magnetic diffusivity in the solar convection zone is one of the\nmost poorly constrained ingredients of mean-field dynamo models. This lack of\nconstraint has previously led to controversy regarding the most appropriate set\nof parameters, as different assumptions on the value of turbulent diffusivity\nlead to radically different solar cycle predictions. Typically, the dynamo\ncommunity uses double step diffusivity profiles characterized by low values of\ndiffusivity in the bulk of the convection zone. However, these low diffusivity\nvalues are not consistent with theoretical estimates based on mixing-length\ntheory -- which suggest much higher values for turbulent diffusivity. To make\nmatters worse, kinematic dynamo simulations cannot yield sustainable magnetic\ncycles using these theoretical estimates. In this work we show that magnetic\ncycles become viable if we combine the theoretically estimated diffusivity\nprofile with magnetic quenching of the diffusivity. Furthermore, we find that\nthe main features of this solution can be reproduced by a dynamo simulation\nusing a prescribed (kinematic) diffusivity profile that is based on the\nspatiotemporal geometric-average of the dynamically quenched diffusivity. Here,\nwe provide an analytic fit to the dynamically quenched diffusivity profile,\nwhich can be used in kinematic dynamo simulations. Having successfully\nreconciled the mixing-length theory estimated diffusivity profile with\nkinematic dynamo models, we argue that they remain a viable tool for\nunderstanding the solar magnetic cycle.\n", "  A novel method to characterize the topology of the early-universe\nintergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic reionization is presented. The\n21-cm radiation background from high redshift is analyzed through the\ncalculation of the 2-dimensional (2D) genus. The radiative transfer of\nhydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in a\nsuite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. The 2D genus is\ncalculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift Universe. We\nconstruct the 2D genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightness\ntemperature, and compare this to the 2D genus curve of the underlying density\nfield. We find that (1) the 2D genus curve reflects the evolutionary track of\ncosmic reionization and (2) the 2D genus curve can discriminate between certain\nreionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties of\nradiation-sources. Choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucial\nfor this analysis. To this end, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is found to be\na suitable apparatus for this analysis in terms of sensitivity, even though\nsome deterioration of the data for this purpose is unavoidable under the\nplanned size of the antenna core.\n", "  We calculate the energy spectra of cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons at a\nplane shock with quasi-parallel magnetic fields, using time-dependent,\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA) simulations, including energy losses via\nsynchrotron emission and Inverse Compton (IC) scattering. A thermal leakage\ninjection model and a Bohm type diffusion coefficient are adopted. The electron\nspectrum at the shock becomes steady after the DSA energy gains balance the\nsynchrotron/IC losses, and it cuts off at the equilibrium momentum p_{eq}. In\nthe postshock region the cutoff momentum of the electron spectrum decreases\nwith the distance from the shock due to the energy losses and the thickness of\nthe spatial distribution of electrons scales as p^{-1}. Thus the slope of the\ndownstream integrated spectrum steepens by one power of p for p_{br}<p<p_{eq},\nwhere the break momentum decrease with the shock age as p_{br}\\propto t^{-1}.\nIn a CR modified shock, both the proton and electron spectrum exhibit a concave\ncurvature and deviate from the canonical test-particle power-law, and the\nupstream integrated electron spectrum could dominate over the downstream\nintegrated spectrum near the cutoff momentum. Thus the spectral shape near the\ncutoff of X-ray synchrotron emission could reveal a signature of nonlinear DSA.\n", "  UBVI CCD photometry of NGC 2353 is obtained as part of the \"Sejong Open\ncluster Survey\" (SOS). Using the photometric membership criteria we selelct\nprobable members of the cluster. We derive the reddening and distance to the\ncluster, i.e. E(B-V) = 0.10 +/- 0.02 mag and 1.17 +/- 0.04 kpc, respectively.\nWe find that the projected distribution of the probable members on the sky is\nelliptical in shape rather than circular. The age of the cluster is estimated\nto be log(age)=8.1 +/- 0.1, older than what was found in previous studies. The\nminimum value of binary fraction is estimated to be about 48 +/- 5 percent from\na Gaussian function fit to the distribution of the distance moduli of the\nphotometric members. Finally, we also obtain the luminosity function and the\ninitial mass function (IMF). The slope of the IMF is Gamma = -1.3 +/- 0.2.\n", "  We report the results of our high resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring\ncampaign ($\\lambda$ = 3800 -- 8800 A, R = 30000 -- 45000) of the new FU\nOrionis-type object HBC 722. We observed HBC 722 with the BOES 1.8-m telescope\nbetween 2010 November 26 and 2010 December 29 and FU Orionis itself on 2011\nJanuary 26. We detect a number of previously unreported high-resolution K I and\nCa II lines beyond 7500 A. We resolve the H$\\alpha$ and Ca II line profiles\ninto three velocity components, which we attribute to both disk and outflow.\nThe increased accretion during outburst can heat the disk to produce the\nrelatively narrow absorption feature and launch outflows appearing as high\nvelocity blue and redshifted broad features.\n", "  We estimate the power spectra of CMB temperature anisotropy in localized\nregions on the sky using the WMAP 7-year data. Here, we report that the north\nhat and the south hat regions at the high Galactic latitude (|b| >= 30 deg)\nshow anomaly in the power spectrum amplitude around the third peak, which is\nstatistically significant up to 3 sigma. We try to figure out the cause of the\nobserved anomaly by analyzing the low Galactic latitude (|b|< 30 deg) regions\nwhere the galaxy contamination is expected to be stronger, and regions that are\nweakly or strongly dominated by the WMAP instrument noise. We also consider the\npossible effect of unresolved radio point sources. We found another but less\nstatistically significant anomaly in the low Galactic latitude north and south\nregions whose behavior is opposite to the one at the high latitude. Our\nanalysis shows that the observed north-south anomaly at high latitude becomes\nweaker on the regions with high number of observations (weak instrument noise),\nsuggesting that the anomaly is significant at sky regions that are dominated by\nthe WMAP instrument noise. We have checked that the observed north-south\nanomaly has weak dependences on the bin-width used in the power spectrum\nestimation and the Galactic latitude cut. We have also discussed the\npossibility that the detected anomaly may hinge on the particular choice of the\nmultipole bin around the third peak. We anticipate that the issue of whether\nthe anomaly is intrinsic one or due to the WMAP instrument noise will be\nresolved by the forthcoming Planck data.\n", "  We present a 1.1 mm emission map of the OMC1 region observed with AzTEC, a\nnew large-format array composed of 144 silicon-nitride micromesh bolometers\nthat was in use at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The AzTEC\nobservations of the OMC1 region at 1.1 mm reveal dozens of cloud cores and a\ntail of filaments in a manner that is almost identical to the submillimeter\ncontinuum emission of the entire OMC1 region at 450 and 850 micronm. The\ndensity power spectrum provides the size distribution of the structures. We\nfind that a single power law might be fitted to the calculated power spectrum\nof the 1.1 mm emission between 0.3 pc and 0.03 pc. The slope of the best fit\npower law is \\gamma \\sim -2.6 and is similar to the spectral index of the power\nspectrum of \\gamma \\sim -2.7 found in numerical simulations. However, there is\na distinct spectral break in the power spectrum at a characteristic scale of\n~0.3 pc in OMC1. The effects of beam size and noise spectrum on the shape and\nslope of the power spectrum are also included in the present analysis. The\nslope of the power law and a range of different scales change at scales below\n~0.3 pc as the beam size increases.\n", "  Y -band is a broad passband that is centered at ~ 1 micron. It is becoming a\nnew, popular window for extragalactic study especially for observation of red\nobjects thanks to recent CCD technology developments. In order to better\nunderstand the general characteristics of objects in Y -band, and to\ninvestigate the promise of Y -band observations with small telescopes, we\ncarried out imaging observation of several extragalactic fields, brown dwarfs\nand high redshift quasars with Y -band filter at the Mt. Lemmon Optical\nAstronomy Observatory and the Maidanak observatory. From our observations, we\nconstrain the bright end of the galaxy and the stellar number counts in Y\n-band. Also, we test the usefulness of high redshift quasar (z > 6) selection\nvia i-z-Y color-color diagram, to demonstrate that the i-z-Y color-color\ndiagram is effective for the selection of high redshift quasars even with a\nconventional optical CCD camera installed at a 1-m class telescope.\n", "  We present a photometric study of the globular clusters (GCs) in the Virgo\ngiant elliptical galaxy M86 based on Washington CT1 images. The colors of the\nGCs in M86 show a bimodal distribution with a blue peak at (C -T1) = 1.30 and a\nred peak at (C -T1) = 1.72. The spatial distribution of the red GCs is\nelongated similarly to that of the stellar halo, while that of the blue GCs is\nroughly circular. The radial number density profile of the blue GCs is more\nextended than that of the red GCs. The radial number density profile of the red\nGCs is consistent with the surface brightness profile of the M86 stellar halo.\nThe GC system has a negative radial color gradient, which is mainly due to the\nnumber ratio of the blue GCs to the red GCs increasing as galactocentric radius\nincrease. The bright blue GCs in the outer region of M86 show a blue tilt: the\nbrighter they are, the redder their mean colors get. These results are\ndiscussed in comparison with other Virgo giant elliptical galaxies.\n", "  Physical cosmology tries to understand the Universe at large with its origin\nand evolution. Observational and experimental situations in cosmology do not\nallow us to proceed purely based on the empirical means. We examine in which\nsense our cosmological assumptions in fact have shaped our current cosmological\nworldview with consequent inevitable limits. Cosmology, as other branches of\nscience and knowledge, is a construct of human imagination reflecting the\npopular belief system of the era. The question at issue deserves further\nphilosophic discussions. In Whitehead's words, \"philosophy, in one of its\nfunctions, is the critic of cosmologies\". (Whitehead 1925)\n", "  Primordial nucleosynthesis, or Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), is one of the\nthree evidences for the Big-Bang model, together with the expansion of the\nUniverse and the Cosmic Microwave Background. There is a good global agreement\nover a range of nine orders of magnitude between abundances of 4He, D, 3He and\n7Li deduced from observations, and calculated in primordial nucleosynthesis.\nThis comparison was used to determine the baryonic density of the Universe. For\nthis purpose, it is now superseded by the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) radiation anisotropies. However, there remain, a yet\nunexplained, discrepancy of a factor 3-5, between the calculated and observed\nlithium primordial abundances, that has not been reduced, neither by recent\nnuclear physics experiments, nor by new observations. We review here the\nnuclear physics aspects of BBN for the production of 4He, D, 3He and 7Li, but\nalso 6Li, 9Be, 11B and up to CNO isotopes. These are, for instance, important\nfor the initial composition of the matter at the origin of the first stars.\nBig-Bang nucleosynthesis, that has been used, to first constrain the baryonic\ndensity, and the number of neutrino families, remains, a valuable tool to probe\nthe physics of the early Universe, like variation of \"constants\" or alternative\ntheories of gravity.\n", "  I present a simple scheme for the treatment of gravitational interactions on\ngalactic scales. In analogy to known mechanisms of quantum field theory, I\nassume ad hoc that gravitation is mediated by virtual exchange particles -\ngravitons - with very small but non-zero masses. The resulting density and mass\nprofiles are proportional to the mass of the gravitating body. The mass profile\nscales with the centripetal acceleration experienced by a test particle\norbiting the central mass; this comes at the cost of postulating a universal\ncharacteristic acceleration a0 = 4.3*10^{-12} m/s^2 (or 8*pi*a0 = 1.1*10^{-10}\nm/s^2). The scheme predicts the asymptotic flattening of galactic rotation\ncurves, the Tully-Fisher/Faber-Jackson relations, the mass\ndiscrepancy-acceleration relation of galaxies, the surface\nbrightness-acceleration relation of galaxies, the kinematics of galaxy\nclusters, and \"Renzo's rule\" correctly; additional (dark) mass components are\nnot required. Given that it is based on various ad-hoc assumptions, and given\nfurther limitations, the scheme I present is not yet a consistent theory of\ngravitation; rather, it is a \"toy model\" providing a convenient scaling law\nthat simplifies the description of gravity on galactic scales.\n", "  We construct several Milky Way-like galaxy models containing a gas halo (as\nwell as gaseous and stellar disks, a dark matter halo, and a stellar bulge)\nfollowing either an isothermal or an NFW density profile with varying mass and\ninitial spin. In addition, galactic winds associated with star formation are\ntested in some of the simulations. We evolve these isolated galaxy models using\nthe GADGET-3 $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation code, paying particular attention\nto the effects of the gas halo on the evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthe models is strongly affected by the adopted gas halo component. The model\nwithout a gas halo shows an increasing star formation rate (SFR) at the\nbeginning of the simulation for some hundreds of millions of years and then a\ncontinuously decreasing rate to the end of the run at 3 Gyr. On the other hand,\nthe SFRs in the models with a gas halo emerge to be either relatively flat\nthroughout the simulations or increasing over a gigayear and then decreasing to\nthe end. The models with the more centrally concentrated NFW gas halo show\noverall higher SFRs than those with the isothermal gas halo of the equal mass.\nThe gas accretion from the halo onto the disk also occurs more in the models\nwith the NFW gas halo, however, this is shown to take place mostly in the inner\npart of the disk and not to contribute significantly to the star formation\nunless the gas halo has very high density at the central part. The rotation of\na gas halo is found to make SFR lower in the model. The SFRs in the runs\nincluding galactic winds are found to be lower than the same runs but without\nwinds. We conclude that the effects of a hot gaseous halo on the evolution of\ngalaxies are generally too significant to be simply ignored, and expect that\nmore hydrodynamical processes in galaxies could be understood through numerical\nsimulations employing both gas disk and gas halo components.\n", "  We probe the feasibility of high-frequency radio observations of very rapid\nflux variations in compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our study assumes\nobservations at 230 GHz with a small 6-meter class observatory, using the SNU\nRadio Astronomical Observatory (SRAO) as example. We find that 33 radio-bright\nsources are observable with signal-to-noise ratios larger than ten. We derive\nstatistical detection limits via exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations assuming\n(a) periodic, and (b) episodic flaring flux variations on time-scales as small\nas tens of minutes. We conclude that a wide range of flux variations is\nobservable. This makes high-frequency radio observations - even with small\nobservatories - a powerful probe of AGN intra-day variability; especially,\nthose observations complement observations at lower radio frequencies with\nlarger observatories like the Korean VLBI Network (KVN).\n", "  Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a possible solution for the missing\nmass problem in galactic dynamics; its predictions are in good agreement with\nobservations in the limit of weak accelerations. However, MOND does not derive\nfrom a physical mechanism and does not make predictions on the transitional\nregime from Newtonian to modified dynamics; rather, empirical transition\nfunctions have to be constructed from the boundary conditions and comparison to\nobservations. I compare the formalism of classical MOND to the scaling law\nderived from a toy model of gravity based on virtual massive gravitons (the\n\"graviton picture\") which I proposed recently. I conclude that MOND naturally\nderives from the \"graviton picture\" at least for the case of non-relativistic,\nhighly symmetric dynamical systems. This suggests that - to first order - the\n\"graviton picture\" indeed provides a valid candidate for the physical mechanism\nbehind MOND and gravity on galactic scales in general.\n", "  In quantum information, complementarity of quantum mechanical observables\nplays a key role. If a system resides in an eigenstate of an observable, the\nprobability distribution for the values of a complementary observable is flat.\nThe eigenstates of these two observables form a pair of mutually unbiased bases\n(MUBs). More generally, a set of MUBs consists of bases that are all pairwise\nunbiased. Except for specific dimensions of the Hilbert space, the maximal sets\nof MUBs are unknown in general. Even for a dimension as low as six, the\nidentification of a maximal set of MUBs remains an open problem, although there\nis strong numerical evidence that no more than three simultaneous MUBs do\nexist. Here, by exploiting a newly developed holographic technique, we\nimplement and test different sets of three MUBs for a single photon\nsix-dimensional quantum state (a qusix), encoded either in a hybrid\npolarization-orbital angular momentum or a pure orbital angular momentum\nHilbert space. A close agreement is observed between theory and experiments.\nOur results can find applications in state tomography, quantitative\nwave-particle duality, quantum key distribution and tests on complementarity\nand logical indeterminacy.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dynamics of two mutually coupled identical\nsingle-mode semi-conductor lasers. For small separation and large coupling\nbetween the lasers, symmetry-broken one-colour states are shown to be stable.\nIn this case the light output of the lasers have significantly different\nintensities while at the same time the lasers are locked to a single common\nfrequency. For intermediate coupling we observe stable symmetry-broken\ntwo-colour states, where both lasers lase simultaneously at two optical\nfrequencies which are separated by up to 150~GHz. Using a five dimensional\nmodel we identify the bifurcation structure which is responsible for the\nappearance of symmetric and symmetry-broken one-colour and two-colour states.\nSeveral of these states give rise to multi-stabilities and therefore allow for\nthe design of all-optical memory elements on the basis of two coupled\nsingle-mode lasers. The switching performance of selected designs of optical\nmemory elements is studied numerically.\n", "  In the limit $\\hbar\\to 0$, we analyze a class of Schr\\\"odinger operators\n$H_\\hbar = \\hbar^2 L + \\hbar W + V\\cdot \\mathrm{id}$ acting on sections of a\nvector bundle $\\mathcal{Eh}$ over a Riemannian manifold $M$ where $L$ is a\nLaplace type operator, $W$ is an endomorphism field and the potential energy\n$V$ has a non-degenerate minimum at some point $p\\in M$. We construct\nquasimodes of WKB-type near $p$ for eigenfunctions associated with the low\nlying eigenvalues of $H_\\hbar$. These are obtained from eigenfunctions of the\nassociated harmonic oscillator $H_{p, \\hbar}$ at $p$, acting on smooth\nfunctions on the tangent space.\n", "  We consider finite charge density geometries which interpolate between AdS2 x\nR2 in the infrared and AdS4 in the ultraviolet, while traversing an\nintermediate regime of anisotropic Lifshitz scaling and hyperscaling violation.\nWe work with Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton models and only turn on a background\nelectric field. The spatially modulated instabilities of the near-horizon AdS2\npart of the geometry are used to argue that the scaling solutions themselves\nshould be thought of as being unstable -- in the deep infrared -- to spatially\nmodulated phases. We identify instability windows for the scaling exponents,\nwhich are refined further by requiring the solutions to satisfy the null energy\ncondition. This analysis reinforces the idea that, for large classes of models,\nspatially modulated phases describe the ground state of hyperscaling violating\nscaling geometries.\n", "  We present a classical analysis on the issue of vector superluminality in the\ndecoupling limit ghost-free massive gravity with a Minkowski reference metric.\nWe show explicitly in the Lorenz gauge that the theory is free of superluminal\nvector excitations around a nontrivial solution at the cubic order in the\nfields. In the same gauge, we demonstrate that superluminal vector modes arise\nat the quartic order and compute some superluminal propagating solutions. We\nthen generalize our findings to all orders in a gauge-independent way. We check\nthe physical consistency of the vector superluminalities, arguing that they are\nnot physically detectable in the perturbation theory but could be trusted\nclassically in the strong coupling region. Nevertheless, these\nsuperluminalities involve only low frequency group and phase velocities and are\nunable to determine the acausality of the theory.\n", "  The previous functional analytic construction of the fermionic projector on\nglobally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds is extended to space-times of infinite\nlifetime. The construction is based on an analysis of families of solutions of\nthe Dirac equation with a varying mass parameter. It makes use of the so-called\nmass oscillation property which implies that integrating over the mass\nparameter generates decay of the Dirac wave functions at infinity. We obtain a\ncanonical decomposition of the solution space of the massive Dirac equation\ninto two subspaces, independent of observers or the choice of coordinates. The\nconstructions are illustrated in the examples of ultrastatic space-times and de\nSitter space-time.\n", "  Polarization is a basic property of light and is fundamentally linked to the\ninternal geometry of a source of radiation. Polarimetry complements\nphotometric, spectroscopic, and imaging analyses of sources of radiation and\nhas made possible multiple astrophysical discoveries. In this article I review\n(i) the physical basics of polarization: electromagnetic waves, photons, and\nparameterizations; (ii) astrophysical sources of polarization: scattering,\nsynchrotron radiation, active media, and the Zeeman, Goldreich-Kylafis, and\nHanle effects, as well as interactions between polarization and matter (like\nbirefringence, Faraday rotation, or the Chandrasekhar-Fermi effect); (iii)\nobservational methodology: on-sky geometry, influence of atmosphere and\ninstrumental polarization, polarization statistics, and observational\ntechniques for radio, optical, and X/gamma wavelengths; and (iv) science cases\nfor astronomical polarimetry: solar and stellar physics, planetary system\nbodies, interstellar matter, astrobiology, astronomical masers, pulsars,\ngalactic magnetic fields, gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, and cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation.\n", "  In this sequel paper we give a shorter, second proof of the monotonicity of\nthe Hawking mass for time flat surfaces under spacelike uniformly area\nexpanding flows in spacetimes that satisfy the dominant energy condition. We\nalso include a third proof which builds on a known formula and describe a class\nof sufficient conditions of divergence type for the monotonicity of the Hawking\nmass. These flows of surfaces may have connections to the problem in general\nrelativity of bounding the total mass of a spacetime from below by the\nquasi-local mass of spacelike 2-surfaces in the spacetime.\n", "  We analyze the dependence of disk morphology (arm class, Hubble type, bar\ntype) of nearby spiral galaxies on the galaxy environment by using local\nbackground density ($\\Sigma_{n}$), projected distance ($r_{p}$), and tidal\nindex ($TI$) as measures of the environment. There is a strong dependence of\narm class and Hubble type on the galaxy environment, while the bar type\nexhibits a weak dependence with a high frequency of SB galaxies in high density\nregions. Grand design fractions and early-type fractions increase with\nincreasing $\\Sigma_{n}$, $1/r_{p}$, and $TI$, while fractions of flocculent\nspirals and late-type spirals decrease. Multiple-arm and intermediate-type\nspirals exhibit nearly constant fractions with weak trends similar to grand\ndesign and early-type spirals. While bar types show only a marginal dependence\non $\\Sigma_{n}$, they show a fairly clear dependence on $r_{p}$ with a high\nfrequency of SB galaxies at small $r_{p}$. The arm class also exhibits a\nstronger correlation with $r_{p}$ than $\\Sigma_{n}$ and $TI$, whereas the\nHubble type exhibits similar correlations with $\\Sigma_{n}$ and $r_{p}$. This\nsuggests that the arm class is mostly affected by the nearest neighbor while\nthe Hubble type is affected by the local densities contributed by neighboring\ngalaxies as well as the nearest neighbor.\n", "  Based on a family of indefinite unitary representations of the diffeomorphism\ngroup of an oriented smooth $4$-manifold, a manifestly covariant $4$\ndimensional and non-perturbative algebraic quantum field theory formulation of\ngravity is exhibited. More precisely among the bounded linear operators acting\non these representation spaces we identify algebraic curvature tensors hence a\nnet of local quantum observables can be constructed from $C^*$-algebras\ngenerated by local curvature tensors and vector fields. This algebraic quantum\nfield theory is extracted from structures provided by an oriented smooth\n$4$-manifold only hence possesses a diffeomorphism symmetry. In this way\nclassical general relativity exactly in $4$ dimensions naturally embeds into a\nquantum framework.\n  Several Hilbert space representations of the theory are found. First a\n\"tautological representation\" of the limiting global $C^*$-algebra is\nconstructed allowing to associate to any oriented smooth $4$-manifold a von\nNeumann algebra in a canonical fashion. Secondly, influenced by the\nDougan--Mason approach to gravitational quasilocal energy-momentum, we\nconstruct certain representations what we call \"positive mass representations\"\nwith unbroken diffeomorphism symmetry. Thirdly, we also obtain \"classical\nrepresentaions\" with spontaneously broken diffeomorphism symmetry corresponding\nto the classical limit of the theory which turns out to be general relativity.\n  Finally we observe that the whole family of \"positive mass representations\"\ncomprise a $2$ dimensional conformal field theory in the sense of G. Segal.\n", "  We report the detection of an exoplanet candidate in orbit around sigma\nPersei from a radial velocity (RV) survey. The system exhibits periodic RV\nvariations of 579.8 +/- 2.4 days. The purpose of the survey is to search for\nlow-amplitude and long-period RV variations in giants and examine the origin of\nthe variations using the fiber-fed Bohyunsan Observatory Echelle Spectrograph\ninstalled at the 1.8-m telescope of Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory in\nKorea. We present high-accuracy RV measurements of sigma Per made from December\n2003 to January 2014. We argue that the RV variations are not related to the\nsurface inhomogeneities but instead a Keplerian motion of the planetary\ncompanion is the most likely explanation. Assuming a stellar mass of 2.25 +/-\n0.5 M_Sun, we obtain a minimum planetary companion mass of 6.5 +/- 1.0 M_Jup,\nwith an orbital semi-major axis of 1.8 +/- 0.1 AU, and an eccentricity of 0.3\n+/- 0.1 around sigma Per.\n", "  In the studies of the squeezing it is customary to focus more attention on\nthe particular squeezed states and their evolution than on the dynamical\noperations that could squeeze simultaneously some wider families of quantum\nstates, independently of their initial shape. We look for new steps in this\ndirection, carried out by softly acting external fields which might produce the\nsqueezing of the canonical observables $q,p$ of charged particles. The works on\nthese problems collect so many valuable results that the question is whether\nsomething more is indeed something more in our knowledge. Yet we decided to\npresent some exactly solvable cases of the problem which appear in the\nsymmetric evolution intervals permitting to find explicitly the time dependence\nof the external fields needed to generate the required evolution operators.\nCuriously, our results are interrelated with a simple anti-commuting algebra of\nToeplitz which describes the problem more easily than the frequently used\nErmakov--Milne invariants. Some trending topics, as well as some fundamental\nproblems in quantum theory, might also be involved.\n", "  We have developed a parallel cosmological hydrodynamic simulation code\ndesigned for the study of formation and evolution of cosmological structures.\nThe gravitational force is calculated using the TreePM method and the\nhydrodynamics is implemented based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The\ninitial displacement and velocity of simulation particles are calculated\naccording to second-order linear perturbation theory using the power spectra of\ndark matter and baryonic matter. The initial background temperature is given by\nRecfast and the temperature uctuations at the initial particle position are\ndetermined by the adiabatic model. We use a time-limiter scheme over the\nindividual time steps to capture shock-fronts and to ease the time-step tension\nbetween the shock and preshock particles. We also include the astrophysical gas\nprocesses of radiative heating/cooling, star formation, metal enrichment, and\nsupernova feedback. We have tested the code in several standard cases such as\none-dimensional Riemann problems, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and Sedov blast wave\ninstability. Star formation on the galactic disk is investigated to check\nwhether the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation is properly recovered. We also study\nglobal star formation histories at different simulation resolutions and compare\nthem with observations.\n", "  Anderson insulators are non-interacting disordered systems which have\nlocalized single particle eigenstates. The interacting analogue of Anderson\ninsulators are the Many-Body Localized (MBL) phases. The natural language for\nrepresenting the spectrum of the Anderson insulator is that of product states\nover the single-particle modes. We show that product states over Matrix Product\nOperators of small bond dimension is the corresponding natural language for\ndescribing the MBL phases. In this language all of the many-body eigenstates\nare encode by Matrix Product States (i.e. DMRG wave function) consisting of\nonly two sets of low bond-dimension matrices per site: the $G_i$ matrix\ncorresponding to the local ground state on site $i$ and the $E_i$ matrix\ncorresponding to the local excited state. All $2^n$ eigenstates can be\ngenerated from all possible combinations of these matrices.\n", "  WFIRST microlensing observations will return high-precision parallaxes,\nsigma(pi) < 0.3 microarcsec, for the roughly 1 million stars with H<14 in its\n2.8 deg^2 field toward the Galactic bulge. Combined with its 40,000 epochs of\nhigh precision photometry (~0.7 mmag at H_vega=14 and ~0.1 mmag at H=8), this\nwill yield a wealth of asteroseismic data of giant stars, primarily in the\nGalactic bulge but including a substantial fraction of disk stars at all\nGalactocentric radii interior to the Sun. For brighter stars, the astrometric\ndata will yield an external check on the radii derived from the two\nasteroseismic parameters, <Delta nu> and nu_max, while for the fainter ones, it\nwill enable a mass measurement from the single measurable asteroseismic\nparameter nu_max. Simulations based on Kepler data indicate that WFIRST will be\ncapable of detecting oscillations in stars from slightly less luminous than the\nred clump to the tip of the red giant branch, yielding roughly 1 million\ndetections.\n", "  We define a two-parameter family of integrable deformations of the principal\nchiral model on an arbitrary compact group. The Yang-Baxter sigma-model and the\nprincipal chiral model with a Wess-Zumino term both correspond to limits in\nwhich one of the two parameters vanishes.\n", "  We study the evolution of the energy spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons\naccelerated at spherically expanding shocks with low Mach numbers and the\nensuing spectral signatures imprinted in radio synchrotron emission.\nTime-dependent simulations of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons\nin the test-particle limit have been performed for spherical shocks with\nparameters relevant for typical shocks in the intracluster medium. The electron\nand radiation spectra at the shock location can be described properly by the\ntest-particle DSA predictions with instantaneous shock parameters. However, the\nvolume integrated spectra of both electrons and radiation deviate significantly\nfrom the test-particle power-laws, because the shock compression ratio and the\nflux of injected electrons at the shock gradually decrease as the shock slows\ndown in time.So one needs to be cautious about interpreting observed radio\nspectra of evolving shocks based on simple DSA models in the test-particle\nregime.\n", "  We present a novel method to implement time-delayed propagation of radiation\nfields in cosmological radiative transfer simulations. Time-delayed propagation\nof radiation fields requires construction of retarded-time fields by tracking\nthe location and lifetime of radiation sources along the corresponding\nlight-cones. Cosmological radiative transfer simulations have, until now,\nignored this \"light-cone effect\" or implemented ray-tracing methods that are\ncomputationally demanding. We show that radiative transfer calculation of the\ntime-delayed fields can be easily achieved in numerical simulations when\nperiodic boundary conditions are used, by calculating the time-discretized\nretarded-time Green's function using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method\nand convolving it with the source distribution. We also present a direct\napplication of this method to the long-range radiation field of Lyman-Werner\nband photons, which is important in the high-redshift astrophysics with first\nstars.\n", "  We use a volume-limited sample of quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) DR7 quasar catalog to identify quasar groups and address their\nstatistical significance. This quasar sample has a uniform selection function\non the sky and nearly a maximum possible contiguous volume that can be drawn\nfrom the DR7 catalog. Quasar groups are identified by using the\nFriend-of-Friend algorithm with a set of fixed comoving linking lengths. We\nfind that the richness distribution of the richest 100 quasar groups or the\nsize distribution of the largest 100 groups are statistically equivalent with\nthose of randomly-distributed points with the same number density and sky\ncoverage when groups are identified with the linking length of 70 h-1Mpc. It is\nshown that the large-scale structures like the huge Large Quasar Group (U1.27)\nreported by Clowes et al. (2013) can be found with high probability even if\nquasars have no physical clustering, and does not challenge the initially\nhomogeneous cosmological models. Our results are statistically more reliable\nthan those of Nadathur (2013), where the test was made only for the largest\nquasar group. It is shown that the linking length should be smaller than 50\nh-1Mpc in order for the quasar groups identified in the DR7 catalog not to be\ndominated by associations of quasars grouped by chance. We present 20 richest\nquasar groups identified with the linking length of 70 h-1Mpc for further\nanalyses.\n", "  We forecast the future constraints on scale-dependent parametrizations of\ngalaxy bias and their impact on the estimate of cosmological parameters from\nthe power spectrum of galaxies measured in a spectroscopic redshift survey. For\nthe latter we assume a wide survey at relatively large redshifts, similar to\nthe planned Euclid survey, as baseline for future experiments. To assess the\nimpact of the bias we perform a Fisher matrix analysis and we adopt two\ndifferent parametrizations of scale-dependent bias. The fiducial models for\ngalaxy bias are calibrated using a mock catalogs of H$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies\nmimicking the expected properties of the objects that will be targeted by the\nEuclid survey.\n  In our analysis we have obtained two main results. First of all, allowing for\na scale-dependent bias does not significantly increase the errors on the other\ncosmological parameters apart from the rms amplitude of density fluctuations,\n$\\sigma_{8}$, and the growth index $\\gamma$, whose uncertainties increase by a\nfactor up to two, depending on the bias model adopted. Second, we find that the\naccuracy in the linear bias parameter $b_{0}$ can be estimated to within 1-2\\%\nat various redshifts regardless of the fiducial model. The non-linear bias\nparameters have significantly large errors that depend on the model adopted.\nDespite of this, in the more realistic scenarios departures from the simple\nlinear bias prescription can be detected with a $\\sim2\\,\\sigma$ significance at\neach redshift explored.\n  Finally, we use the Fisher Matrix formalism to assess the impact of assuming\nan incorrect bias model and found that the systematic errors induced on the\ncosmological parameters are similar or even larger than the statistical ones.\n", "  The low-temperature physics of quantum many-body systems is largely governed\nby the structure of their ground states. Minimizing the energy of local\ninteractions, ground states often reflect strong properties of locality such as\nthe area law for entanglement entropy and the exponential decay of correlations\nbetween spatially separated observables. In this letter we present a novel\ncharacterization of locality in quantum states, which we call `local\nreversibility'. It characterizes the type of operations that are needed to\nreverse the action of a general disturbance on the state. We prove that unique\nground states of gapped local Hamiltonian are locally reversible. This way, we\nidentify new fundamental features of many-body ground states, which cannot be\nderived from the aforementioned properties. We use local reversibility to\ndistinguish between states enjoying microscopic and macroscopic quantum\nphenomena. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we prove specific\nproperties of ground states, which are relevant both to critical and\nnon-critical theories.\n", "  We study, using quantum Monte-Carlo simulations, the bosonic Kondo-Hubbard\nmodel in a two dimensional square lattice. We explore the phase diagram and\nanalyse the mobility of particles and magnetic properties. At unit filling, the\ntransition from a paramagnetic Mott insulator to a ferromagnetic superfluid\nappears continuous, contrary to what was predicted with mean field. For double\noccupation per site, both the Mott insulating and superfluid phases are\nferromagnetic and the transition is still continuous. Multiband tight binding\nHamiltonians can be realized in optical lattice experiments, which offer not\nonly the possibility of tuning the different energy scales over wide ranges,\nbut also the option of loading the system with either fermionic or bosonic\natoms.\n", "  Spiral structure is the most distinctive feature of disk galaxies and yet\ndebate persists about which theory of spiral structure is the correct one. Many\nversions of the density wave theory demand that the pitch angle is uniquely\ndetermined by the distribution of mass in the bulge and disk of the galaxy. We\npresent evidence that the tangent of the pitch angle of logarithmic spiral arms\nin disk galaxies correlates strongly with the density of neutral atomic\nhydrogen in the disk and with the central stellar bulge mass of the galaxy.\nThese three quantities, when plotted against each other, form a planar\nrelationship which, we argue should be fundamental to our understanding of\nspiral structure in disk galaxies. We further argue that any successful theory\nof spiral structure must be able to explain this relationship.\n", "  Euclid, which is primarily a dark-energy/cosmology mission, may have a\nmicrolensing component, consisting of perhaps four dedicated one-month\ncampaigns aimed at the Galactic bulge. We show that such a program would yield\nexcellent auxilliary science, including asteroseimology detections for about\n100,000 giant stars, and detection of about 1000 Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs),\ndown to 2--2.5 mag below the observed break in the KBO luminosity function at I\n~26. For the 400 KBOs below the break, Euclid will measure accurate orbits,\nwith fractional period errors <~ 2.5%.\n", "  Combining density functional theory (DFT) and embedded dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) methods, we study the metal-insulator transition in\n$R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($R$=Y, Eu, Sm, Nd, Pr, and Bi) and the topological nature of\nthe insulating compounds. Accurate free energies evaluated using the charge\nself-consistent DFT+DMFT method reveal that the metal-insulator transition\noccurs for an A-cation radius between that of Nd and Pr, in agreement with\nexperiments. The all-in-all-out magnetic phase, which is stable in the Nd\ncompound but not the Pr one, gives rise to a small Ir$^{4+}$ magnetic moment of\n$\\approx 0.5\\mu_B$ and opens a sizable correlated gap. We demonstrate that\nwithin this state-of-the-art theoretical method, the insulating bulk pyrochlore\niridates are topologically trivial.\n", "  For a unital completely positive map $\\Phi$ (\"quantum channel\") governing the\ntime propagation of a quantum system, the Stinespring representation gives an\nenlarged system evolving unitarily. We argue that the Stinespring\nrepresentations of each power $\\Phi^m$ of the single map together encode the\nstructure of the original quantum channel and provides an interaction-dependent\nmodel for the bath. The same bath model gives a \"classical limit\" at infinite\ntime $m\\to\\infty$ in the form of a noncommutative \"manifold\" determined by the\nchannel. In this way a simplified analysis of the system can be performed by\nmaking the large-$m$ approximation. These constructions are based on a\nnoncommutative generalization of Berezin quantization. The latter is shown to\ninvolve very fundamental aspects of quantum-information theory, which are\nthereby put in a completely new light.\n", "  The existence problem for mutually unbiased bases is an unsolved problem in\nquantum information theory. A related question is whether every pair of bases\nadmits vectors that are unbiased to both. Mathematically this translates to the\nquestion whether two Lagrangian Clifford tori intersect, and a body of results\nexists concerning it. These (deep!) results are however rather weak when viewed\nfrom the point of view of the first problem. We make a detailed study of how\nthe intersections behave in the simplest non-trivial case, that of complex\nprojective 2-space (the qutrit), for which the set of Clifford tori can be\nusefully parametrized by the unistochastic subset of Birkhoff's polytope. An\ninteresting picture emerges. A foray into higher dimensions is included.\n", "  In this paper, we developed an algebraic formulation for the generalized\nthermal coherent states with a Thermofield Dynamics approach for multi-modes,\nbased on coset space of Lie groups. In particular, we applied our construction\non $SU(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$ symmetries and we obtain their thermal coherent states\nand density operator. We also calculate their thermal quantum Fidelity and\nthermal Wigner function.\n", "  Solar neutrino studies triggered and largely motivated the major developments\nin neutrino physics in the last 50 years. Theory of neutrino propagation in\ndifferent media with matter and fields has been elaborated. It includes\noscillations in vacuum and matter, resonance flavor conversion and resonance\noscillations, spin and spin-flavor precession, etc. LMA MSW has been\nestablished as the true solution of the solar neutrino problem. Parameters\ntheta12 and Delta_m21^2 have been measured; theta13 extracted from the solar\ndata is in agreement with results from reactor experiments. Solar neutrino\nstudies provide a sensitive way to test theory of neutrino oscillations and\nconversion. Characterized by long baseline, huge fluxes and low energies they\nare a powerful set-up to search for new physics beyond the standard 3nu\nparadigm: new neutrino states, sterile neutrinos, non-standard neutrino\ninteractions, effects of violation of fundamental symmetries, new dynamics of\nneutrino propagation, probes of space and time. These searches allow us to get\nstringent, and in some cases unique bounds on new physics. We summarize the\nresults on physics of propagation, neutrino properties and physics beyond the\nstandard model obtained from studies of solar neutrinos.\n", "  When gently placing a droplet onto a vertically vibrated bath, a drop can\nbounce without coalescing. Upon increasing the forcing acceleration, the\ndroplet is propelled by the wave it generates and becomes a walker with a well\ndefined speed. We investigate the confinement of a walker in different\nrectangular cavities, used as waveguides for the Faraday waves emitted by\nsuccessive droplet bounces. By studying the walker velocities, we discover that\n1d confinement is optimal for narrow channels of width of $D \\simeq 1.5\n\\lambda_F $. We also propose an analogy with waveguide models based on the\nobservation of the Faraday instability within the channels.\n", "  We consider the question whether electromagnetism can be derived from quantum\nphysics of measurements. It turns out that this is possible, both for quantum\nand classical electromagnetism, if we use more recent innovations such as\nsmearing of observables and simultaneous measurability. In this way we justify\nthe use of von Neumann-type measurement models for physical processes.\n  We apply operational quantum measurement theory to gain insight in\nfundamental aspects of quantum physics. Interactions of von Neumann type make\nthe Heisenberg evolution of observables describable using explicit operator\ndeformations. In this way one can obtain quantized electromagnetism as a\nmeasurement of a system by another. The relevant deformations (Rieffel\ndeformations) have a mathematically well-defined \"classical\" limit which is\nindeed classical electromagnetism for our choice of interaction.\n", "  We discuss in detail algorithms for implementing tensor network\nrenormalization (TNR) for the study of classical statistical and quantum\nmany-body systems. Firstly, we recall established techniques for how the\npartition function of a 2D classical many-body system or the Euclidean path\nintegral of a 1D quantum system can be represented as a network of tensors,\nbefore describing how TNR can be implemented to efficiently contract the\nnetwork via a sequence of coarse-graining transformations. The efficacy of the\nTNR approach is then benchmarked for the 2D classical statistical and 1D\nquantum Ising models; in particular the ability of TNR to maintain a high level\nof accuracy over sustained coarse-graining transformations, even at a critical\npoint, is demonstrated.\n", "  We emphasized the importance of underlying noncommutative geometry or\nLorenz-covariant quantized space-time towards ultimate theory of quantum\ngravity and Planck scale physics. We focused there our attention on the\nstatistical and substantial understanding of Bekenstein-Hawking's Area-Entropy\nLaw of black holes in terms of Kinematical Holographic Relation (KHR). KHR\nmanifestly holds in Yang's quantized space-time as the result of kinematical\nreduction of spatial degrees of freedom caused by its own nature of\nnoncommutative geometry and plays an important role in our approach without any\nrecourse to the familiar hypothesis, so-called Holographic Principle. In the\npresent paper, we find out a {\\it unified} form of KHR applicable to the whole\nregion ranging from macroscopic to microscopic scales in spatial dimension $\nd=3.$ We notice a possibility of nontrivial modification of Area-Entropy Law of\nBlack Holes which becomes most remarkable in the extremely microscopic system\nclose to Planck scale. We finally refer to the historical background of\nnoncommutative geometry or quantized space-time.\n", "  Galaxy formation models are now able to reproduce observed relations such as\nthe relation between galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses\n($M_*$) and the stellar mass--halo mass relation. We demonstrate that\ncomparisons of the short-timescale variability in galaxy SFRs with\nobservational data provide an additional useful constraint on the physics of\ngalaxy formation feedback. We apply SFR indicators with different sensitivity\ntimescales to galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE)\nsimulations. We find that the SFR--$M_*$ relation has a significantly greater\nscatter when the H$\\alpha$-derived SFR is considered compared with when the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV)-based SFR is used. This difference is a direct\nconsequence of bursty star formation because the FIRE galaxies exhibit\norder-of-magnitude SFR variations over timescales of a few Myr. We show that\nthe difference in the scatter between the simulated H$\\alpha$- and FUV-derived\nSFR--$M_*$ relations at $z=2$ is consistent with observational constraints. We\nalso find that the H$\\alpha$/FUV ratios predicted by the simulations at $z=0$\nare similar to those observed for local galaxies except for a population of\nlow-mass ($M_* \\lesssim 10^{9.5} {\\rm M}_\\odot$) simulated galaxies with lower\nH$\\alpha$/FUV ratios than observed. We suggest that future cosmological\nsimulations should compare the H$\\alpha$/FUV ratios of their galaxies with\nobservations to constrain the feedback models employed.\n", "  We state a general conjecture that T-duality trivialises a model for the\nbulk-boundary correspondence in the parametrised context. We give evidence that\nit is valid by proving it in a special interesting case, which is relevant both\nto String Theory and to the study of topological insulators with defects in\nCondensed Matter Physics.\n", "  The angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature anisotropies reconstructed from Planck data seem to present too\nmuch gravitational lensing distortion. This is quantified by the control\nparameter $A_L$ that should be compatible with unity for a standard cosmology.\nWith the Class Boltzmann solver and the profile-likelihood method, for this\nparameter we measure a 2.6$\\sigma$ shift from 1 using the Planck public\nlikelihoods. We show that, owing to strong correlations with the reionization\noptical depth $\\tau$ and the primordial perturbation amplitude $A_s$, a\n$\\sim2\\sigma$ tension on $\\tau$ also appears between the results obtained with\nthe low ($\\ell\\leq 30$) and high ($30<\\ell\\lesssim 2500$) multipoles\nlikelihoods. With Hillipop, another high-$\\ell$ likelihood built from Planck\ndata, this difference is lowered to $1.3\\sigma$. In this case, the $A_L$ value\nis still in disagreement with unity by $2.2\\sigma$, suggesting a non-trivial\neffect of the correlations between cosmological and nuisance parameters. To\nbetter constrain the nuisance foregrounds parameters, we include the very high\n$\\ell$ measurements of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole\nTelescope (SPT) experiments and obtain $A_L = 1.03 \\pm 0.08$. The\nHillipop+ACT+SPT likelihood estimate of the optical depth is\n$\\tau=0.052\\pm{0.035,}$ which is now fully compatible with the low $\\ell$\nlikelihood determination. After showing the robustness of our results with\nvarious combinations, we investigate the reasons for this improvement that\nresults from a better determination of the whole set of foregrounds parameters.\nWe finally provide estimates of the $\\Lambda$CDM parameters with our combined\nCMB data likelihood.\n", "  The absorption of broadband photons in atomic ensembles requires either an\neffective broadening of the atomic transition linewidth, or an off-resonance\nRaman interaction. Here we propose a scheme for a quantum memory capable of\nstoring and retrieving ultrafast photons in an ensemble of two-level atoms by\nusing a propagation medium with a time-dependent refractive index generated\nfrom aligning an ensemble of gas-phase diatomic molecules. The refractive index\ndynamics generates an effective longitudinal inhomogeneous broadening of the\ntwo-level transition. We numerically demonstrate this scheme for storage and\nretrieval of a weak pulse as short as 50 fs, with a storage time of up to 20\nps. With additional optical control of the molecular alignment dynamics, the\nstorage time can be extended about one nanosecond leading to time-bandwidth\nproducts of order $10^4$. This scheme could in principle be achieved using\neither a hollow-core fiber or a high-pressure gas cell, in a gaseous host\nmedium comprised of diatomic molecules and a two-level atomic vapor at room\ntemperature.\n", "  In low-rank matrix recovery, one aims to reconstruct a low-rank matrix from a\nminimal number of linear measurements. Within the paradigm of compressed\nsensing, this is made computationally efficient by minimizing the nuclear norm\nas a convex surrogate for rank.\n  In this work, we identify an improved regularizer based on the so-called\ndiamond norm, a concept imported from quantum information theory. We show that\n-for a class of matrices saturating a certain norm inequality- the descent cone\nof the diamond norm is contained in that of the nuclear norm. This suggests\nsuperior reconstruction properties for these matrices. We explicitly\ncharacterize this set of matrices. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that\nthe diamond norm indeed outperforms the nuclear norm in a number of relevant\napplications: These include signal analysis tasks such as blind matrix\ndeconvolution or the retrieval of certain unitary basis changes, as well as the\nquantum information problem of process tomography with random measurements.\n  The diamond norm is defined for matrices that can be interpreted as order-4\ntensors and it turns out that the above condition depends crucially on that\ntensorial structure. In this sense, this work touches on an aspect of the\nnotoriously difficult tensor completion problem.\n", "  The optical UBVRI photometric analysis has been established using SLOAN\nDIGITAL SKY SURVEY (SDSS database) in order to estimate the astrophysical\nparameters of poorly studied open star cluster IC 2156. The results of the\npresent study are compared with a previous one of ours, which relied on the\n2MASS JHK infrared photometry. The stellar density distributions and\ncolor-magnitude diagrams of the cluster are used to determine the geometrical\nstructure; limited radius, core and tidal radii, the distances from the Sun,\nfrom the Galactic plane and from the Galactic center. Also, the main\nphotometric parameters; age, distance modulus, color excesses, membership,\ntotal mass, luminosity, mass functions and relaxation time; have been\nestimated.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a novel multi-scale technique to study many-body\nquantum systems where the total number of particles is kept fixed. The method\nis based on Feshbach map and the scales are represented by occupation numbers\nof particle states. Here, we consider a three-modes (including the zero mode)\nBogoliubov Hamiltonian for a sufficiently small ratio between the kinetic\nenergy and the Fourier component of the (positive type) potential corresponding\nto the two nonzero modes. For any space dimension d\\geq 1 and in the mean field\nlimiting regime (i.e., at fixed box volume |\\Lambda| and for a number of\nparticles, N, sufficiently large) this method provides the construction of the\nground state and its expansion in terms of the bare operators that in the limit\nN \\to \\infty is up to any desired precision. In space dimension d \\geq 3 the\nmethod provides similar results for an arbitrarily large (finite) box and a\nlarge but fixed particle density \\rho, i.e.,\\rho is independent of the size of\nthe box.\n", "  The recent experimental results of LHCb collaboration suggested the existence\nof pentaquark states with charmonium. To understand the structure of the\nstates, a dynamical calculation of 5-quark systems with quantum numbers\n$IJ^P=\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2})^\\pm$, $\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2})^\\pm$ and\n$\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{5}{2})^\\pm$ is performed in the framework of chiral quark\nmodel with the help of gaussian expansion method. The results show that the\nnegative parity states can be bound states while all of the positive parity\nstates are the scattering states. The $P_c(4380)$ state is suggested to be the\nbound state of $\\Sigma^*_cD$. Although the energy of $\\Sigma_cD^*$ is very\nclose to the mass of $P_c(4450)$, the inconsistent parity prevents the\nassignment. The calculated distances between quarks confirm the molecular\nnature of the states. Other five-quark bound states of the combination of\n$\\Sigma_cD$ and $\\Sigma^*_cD^*$ are also found in the region about 4.3GeV and\n4.5GeV.\n", "  We study the stability of quantum pure states and, more generally, subspaces\nfor stochastic dynamics that describe continuously--monitored systems. We show\nthat the target subspace is almost surely invariant if and only if it is\ninvariant for the average evolution, and that the same equivalence holds for\nthe global asymptotic stability. Moreover, we prove that a strict linear\nLyapunov function for the average evolution always exists, and latter can be\nused to derive sharp bounds on the Lyapunov exponents of the associated\nsemigroup. Nonetheless, we also show that taking into account the measurements\ncan lead to an improved bound on stability rate for the stochastic,\nnon-averaged dynamics. We discuss explicit examples where the almost sure\nstability rate can be made arbitrary large while the average one stays\nconstant.\n", "  We consider the possibility that tidal disruption events (TDEs) caused by\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) in nearby galaxies can account for the\nultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) hotspot reported recently by the Telescope\nArray (TA) and the warm spot by Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO). We describe the\nexpected cosmic-ray signal from a TDE and derive the constraints set by the\ntimescale for dispersion due to intergalactic magnetic fields and the accretion\ntime of the SMBH. We find that TDEs in M82 can explain the hotspot detected by\nthe TA regardless of whether the UHECRs are composed of protons or heavier\nnuclei. We then check for consistency of the hot and warm spots from M82 and\nCen A with the full-sky isotropic signal from all SMBHs within the GZK radius.\nThis analysis applies to any scenario in which the hot/warm spots are real and\ndue to M82 and Cen A, regardless of whether TDEs are the source of UHECRs. We\nfind that the isotropic flux implied by the luminosity density inferred from\nM82 and Cen A is bigger than that observed by roughly an order of magnitude,\nbut we provide several possible explanations, including the possibility of a\nlocal overdensity and the possibility of intermediate-mass nuclei in UHECRs, to\nresolve the tension.\n", "  We investigate the spin-polarized chain of ultracold fermionic atoms with\nspin-3/2 described by the fermionic Hubbard model with SU(4) symmetric\nattractive interaction. The competition of bound pairs, trions, quartets and\nunbound atoms is studied analytically and by density matrix renormalization\ngroup simulations. We find several distinct states where bound particles\ncoexist with the ferromagnetic state of unpaired fermions. In particular, an\nexotic inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)-type superfluid of\nquartets in a magnetic background of uncorrelated atoms is found for weaker\ninteractions. We show that the system can be driven from this quartet-FFLO\nstate to a molecular state of localized quartets which is also reflected in the\nstatic structure factor. For strong enough coupling, spatial segregation\nbetween molecular crystals and ferromagnetic liquids emerges due to the large\neffective mass of the composite particles.\n", "  If the Universe is dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy as in the\ncurrently popular LCDM cosmology, it is expected that large scale structures\nform gradually, with galaxy clusters of mass M > ~10^14 Msun appearing at\naround 6 Gyrs after the Big Bang (z ~ 1). Here, we report the discovery of 59\nmassive structures of galaxies with masses greater than a few x 10^13 Msun at\nredshifts between z=0.6 and 4.5 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey\nfields. The massive structures are identified by running top-hat filters on the\ntwo dimensional spatial distribution of magnitude-limited samples of galaxies\nusing a combination of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. We analyze the\nMillennium simulation data in a similar way to the analysis of the\nobservational data in order to test the LCDM cosmology. We find that there are\ntoo many massive structures (M > 7 x 10^13 Msun) observed at z > 2 in\ncomparison with the simulation predictions by a factor of a few, giving a\nprobability of < 1/2500 of the observed data being consistent with the\nsimulation. Our result suggests that massive structures have emerged early, but\nthe reason for the discrepancy with the simulation is unclear. It could be due\nto the limitation of the simulation such as the lack of key, unrecognized\ningredients (strong non-Gaussianity or other baryonic physics), or simply a\ndifficulty in the halo mass estimation from observation, or a fundamental\nproblem of the LCDM cosmology. On the other hand, the over-abundance of massive\nstructures at high redshifts does not favor heavy neutrino mass of ~ 0.3 eV or\nlarger, as heavy neutrinos make the discrepancy between the observation and the\nsimulation more pronounced by a factor of 3 or more.\n", "  We use the NIHAO galaxy formation simulations to make predictions for the\nbaryonic budget in present day galaxies ranging from dwarf to Milky Way masses.\nThe sample is made of 88 independent high resolution cosmological zoom-in\nsimulations. NIHAO galaxies reproduce key properties of observed galaxies, such\nas the stellar mass vs halo mass and cold gas vs stellar mass relations. Thus\nthey make plausible predictions for the baryon budget. We present the mass\nfractions of stars, cold gas ($T<10^4$K), cool gas ($10^4 < T < 10^5$K),\nwarm-hot gas ($10^5 < T < 5\\times10^6$K), and hot gas (T$> 5\\times10^6$K)\ninside the virial radius, $R_{200}$. Compared to the predicted baryon mass,\nusing the dark halo mass and the universal baryon fraction, $f_{\\rm b}\\equiv\n\\Omega_{\\rm b}/\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.15$, we find that all of our haloes are missing\nbaryons. The missing mass has been relocated past 2 virial radii, and cool gas\ndominates the corona at low mass (M$_{200} < 3 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$) while\nthe warm-hot gas dominates at high mass (M$_{200} > 3 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$).\nHaloes of mass $\\sim 10^{10} M_\\odot$ are missing $\\sim 90\\%$ of their baryons.\nMore massive haloes ($\\sim 10^{12} M_\\odot$) retain a higher fraction of their\nbaryons, with $\\sim 30\\%$ missing, consistent with recent observational\nestimates. Moreover, these more massive haloes reproduce the observed fraction\nof cold, warm-hot and hot gas. The fraction of cool gas we predict\n($0.11\\pm0.06$) is significantly lower than the observation from COS-HALOs\n(0.3-0.47), but agrees with the alternative analysis of Stern et al. 2016.\n", "  The spatially conformally flat approximation (CFA) is a viable method to\ndeduce initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of binary neutron stars\nemploying the full Einstein equations. Here we review the status of the\noriginal formulation of the CFA for the general relativistic hydrodynamic\ninitial conditions of binary neutron stars. We illustrate the stability of the\nconformally flat condition on the hydrodynamics by numerically evolving ~100\nquasi-circular orbits. We illustrate the use of this approximation for orbiting\nneutron stars in the quasi-circular orbit approximation to demonstrate the\nequation of state dependence of these initial conditions and how they might\naffect the emergent gravitational wave frequency as the stars approach the\ninnermost stable circular orbit.\n", "  In this paper, we consider two time-harmonic inverse scattering problems of\nreconstructing penetrable inhomogeneous obstacles from near field measurements.\nFirst we appeal to the Born approximation for reconstructing small isotropic\nscatterers via the MUSIC algorithm. Some numerical reconstructions using the\nMUSIC algorithm are provided for reconstructing the scatterer and piecewise\nconstant refractive index using a Bayesian method. We then consider the\nreconstruction of an anisotropic extended scatterer by {a modified linear\nsampling method and the factorization method applied }to the near field\noperator. This provides a rigorous characterization of the support of the\nanisotropic obstacle in terms of a range test derived from the measured data.\nUnder appropriate assumptions on the material parameters, the derived\nfactorization can be used to determine the support of the medium without\na-priori knowledge of the material properties.\n", "  Augmenting the \\emph{WFIRST} microlensing campaigns with intensive\nobservations from a ground-based network of wide-field survey telescopes would\nhave several major advantages. First, it would enable full two-dimensional\n(2-D) vector microlens parallax measurements for a substantial fraction of\nlow-mass lenses as well as planetary and binary events that show caustic\ncrossing features. For a significant fraction of the free-floating planet (FFP)\nevents and all caustic-crossing planetary/binary events, these 2-D parallax\nmeasurements directly lead to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) of the lens object (or lens system). For even more events, the\ncomplementary ground-based observations will yield 1-D parallax measurements.\nTogether with the 1-D parallaxes from \\emph{WFIRST} alone, they can probe the\nentire mass range $M\\gtrsim M_\\oplus$. For luminous lenses, such 1-D parallax\nmeasurements can be promoted to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) by high-resolution imaging. This would provide crucial information\nnot only about the hosts of planets and other lenses, but also enable a much\nmore precise Galactic model. Other benefits of such a survey include improved\nunderstanding of binaries (particularly with low mass primaries), and\nsensitivity to distant ice-giant and gas-giant companions of \\emph{WFIRST}\nlenses that cannot be detected by \\emph{WFIRST} itself due to its restricted\nobserving windows. Existing ground-based microlensing surveys can be employed\nif \\emph{WFIRST} is pointed at lower-extinction fields than is currently\nenvisaged. This would come at some cost to the event rate. Therefore the\nbenefits of improved characterization of lenses must be weighed against these\ncosts.\n", "  The development of neuromorphic systems based on memristive elements -\nresistors with memory - requires a fundamental understanding of their\ncollective dynamics when organized in networks. Here, we study an\nexperimentally inspired model of two-dimensional disordered memristive networks\nsubject to a slowly ramped voltage and show that they undergo a first-order\nphase transition in the conductivity for sufficiently high values of memory, as\nquantified by the memristive ON/OFF ratio. We investigate the consequences of\nthis transition for the memristive current-voltage characteristics both through\nsimulation and theory, and uncover a duality between forward and reverse\nswitching processes that has also been observed in several experimental systems\nof this sort. Our work sheds considerable light on the statistical properties\nof memristive networks that are presently studied both for unconventional\ncomputing and as models of neural networks.\n", "  In QED and QCD [1, 2], infrared photons and gluons alter the Hilbert space of\nthe theory so that the in and out states live in a Hilbert space carrying a\nrepresentation of basic commutation relations which is non-equivalent to the\nstandard Fock representation, leading to spontaneous breakdown of Lorentz\nsymmetry and physical effects. These results are generalized here to quantum\ngravity regarded as an SL(2; C) gauge theory and the shift of the ADM energy\ndensity and mass from infrared spin connection (the spin cloud) is discussed.\n", "  Using the exquisite depth of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF12 programme)\ndataset, we explore the ongoing assembly of the outermost regions of the most\nmassive galaxies ($\\rm M_{\\rm stellar}\\geq$ 5$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) at\n$z \\leq$ 1. The outskirts of massive objects, particularly Early-Types Galaxies\n(ETGs), are expected to suffer a dramatic transformation across cosmic time due\nto continuous accretion of small galaxies. HUDF imaging allows us to study this\nprocess at intermediate redshifts in 6 massive galaxies, exploring the\nindividual surface brightness profiles out to $\\sim$25 effective radii. We find\nthat 5-20\\% of the total stellar mass for the galaxies in our sample is\ncontained within 10 $< R <$ 50 kpc. These values are in close agreement with\nnumerical simulations, and higher than those reported for local late-type\ngalaxies ($\\lesssim$5\\%). The fraction of stellar mass stored in the outer\nenvelopes/haloes of Massive Early-Type Galaxies increases with decreasing\nredshift, being 28.7\\% at $< z > =$ 0.1, 15.1\\% at $< z > =$ 0.65 and 3.5\\% at\n$< z > =$ 2. The fraction of mass in diffuse features linked with ongoing minor\nmerger events is $>$ 1-2\\%, very similar to predictions based on observed close\npair counts. Therefore, the results for our small albeit meaningful sample\nsuggest that the size and mass growth of the most massive galaxies have been\nsolely driven by minor and major merging from $z =$ 1 to today.\n", "  Observations of Galactic H I gas for seven targeted regions at intermediate\nGalactic latitude are presented at 1' angular resolution using data from the\nDRAO Synthesis Telescope (ST) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The DHIGLS\ndata are the most extensive arcminute resolution measurements of the diffuse\natomic interstellar medium beyond those in the Galactic plane. The acquisition,\nreduction, calibration, and mosaicking of the DRAO ST data and the cross\ncalibration and incorporation of the short-spacing information from the GBT are\ndescribed. The high quality of the resulting DHIGLS products enables a variety\nof new studies in directions of low Galactic column density. We analyze the\nangular power spectra of maps of the integrated H I emission (column density)\nfrom the data cubes for several distinct velocity ranges. Fitting power\nspectrum models based on a power law, but including the effects of the\nsynthesized beam and noise at high spatial frequencies, we find exponents\nranging from -2.5 to -3.0.. Power spectra of maps of the centroid velocity for\nthese components give similar results. These exponents are interpreted as being\nrepresentative of the 3D density and 3D velocity fields of the atomic gas,\nrespectively. We find evidence for dramatic changes in the H I structures in\nchannel maps over even small changes in velocity. This narrow line emission has\ncounterparts in absorption spectra against bright background radio sources,\nquantifying that the gas is cold and dense and can be identified as the cold\nneutral medium phase. Fully reduced DHIGLS H I data cubes and other data\nproducts are available at www.cita.utoronto.ca/DHIGLS.\n", "  Multiple color selection techniques have been successful in identifying\nquasars from wide-field broad-band imaging survey data. Among the quasars that\nhave been discovered so far, however, there is a redshift gap at $5 \\lesssim\n{\\rm z} \\lesssim 5.7$ due to the limitations of filter sets in previous\nstudies. In this work, we present a new selection technique of high redshift\nquasars using a sequence of medium-band filters: nine filters with central\nwavelengths from 625 to 1025 nm and bandwidths of 50 nm. Photometry with these\nmedium-bands traces the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a source, similar\nto spectroscopy with resolution R $\\sim$ 15. By conducting medium-band\nobservations of high redshift quasars at 4.7 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 6.0 and brown\ndwarfs (the main contaminants in high redshift quasar selection) using the SED\ncamera for QUasars in EArly uNiverse (SQUEAN) on the 2.1-m telescope at the\nMcDonald Observatory, we show that these medium-band filters are superior to\nmulti-color broad-band color section in separating high redshift quasars from\nbrown dwarfs. In addition, we show that redshifts of high redshift quasars can\nbe determined to an accuracy of $\\Delta{\\rm z}/(1+{\\rm z}) = 0.002$ -- $0.026$.\nThe selection technique can be extended to z $\\sim$ 7, suggesting that the\nmedium-band observation can be powerful in identifying quasars even at the\nre-ionization epoch.\n", "  We examine the efficacy of Dark-mode plasmonics as a platform for enhanced\nmagneto-optics. Dark-mode of a small particle consists of two co-existing\nequal-intensity and mutually opposing dipolar excitations. Each of these two\nopposing dipoles may even resonate at or near the dark-mode frequency, but the\nnet dipole moment vanishes due to the mutual cancelation between the opposing\ndipoles. We show that application of external magnetic bias may alleviate the\nintense destructive interference. Furthermore, under external magnetic bias the\nopposing dark-resonances of a plasmonic particle shift in opposite directions\nand create a region of extremely sensitive Faraday rotation. We show that the\nmagnetized dark resonance in lossless Ag-like particle may provide more than 20\ndegrees rotation under magnetic fields of the order of 1-2 Tesla, exhibiting\nmagneto-plasmonic activity that is 2-3 orders of magnitude larger than that\nobserved in conventional plasmonic particle of the same material.\n", "  We study the dynamical evolution of the putative gas clouds G1 and G2\nrecently discovered in the Galactic center. Following earlier studies\nsuggesting that these two clouds are part of a larger gas streamer, we combine\ntheir orbits into a single trajectory. Since the gas clouds experience a drag\nforce from background gas, this trajectory is not exactly Keplerian. By\nassuming the G1 and G2 clouds trace this trajectory, we fit for the drag force\nthey experience and thus extract information about the accretion flow at a\ndistance of thousands of Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. This range of\nradii is important for theories of black hole accretion, but is currently\nunconstrained by observations.\n  In this paper we extend our previous work by accounting for radial forces due\nto possible inflow or outflow of the background gas. Such radial forces drive\nprecession in the orbital plane, allowing a slightly better fit to the G1 and\nG2 data. This precession delays the pericenter passage of G2 by 4-5 months\nrelative to estimates derived from a Keplerian orbital fit; if it proves\npossible to identify the pericenter time observationally, this enables an\nimmediate test of whether G1 and G2 are gas clouds part of a larger gas\nstreamer. If G2 is indeed a gas cloud, its closest approach likely occurred in\nlate summer 2014, after many of the observing campaigns monitoring G2's\nanticipated pericenter passage ended. We discuss how this affects\ninterpretation of the G2 observations.\n", "  Galactic outflows play an important role in galactic evolution. Despite their\nimportance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into\nthe nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst\ngalaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,\nand specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of\ncosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects\ncan have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors\ndepending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming\ninstability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on\nself-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to\nthe streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the\nturbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their\neffective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic\nrays could scatter from \"extrinsic turbulence\" that is driven by another\nmechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvenic cosmic\nray streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays\nstream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered\nmagnetic fields and, in the process, accelerate more tenuous gas away from the\ngalaxy. For cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the\nobservational constraints, cosmic rays reduce the galactic star formation rates\nand significantly aid in launching galactic winds.\n", "  We report the characterization of a massive (m_p=3.9 +- 1.4 M_jup)\nmicrolensing planet (OGLE-2015-BLG-0954Lb) orbiting an M dwarf host (M=0.33 +-\n0.12 M_sun) at a distance toward the Galactic bulge of 0.6 (+0.4,-0.2) kpc,\nwhich is extremely nearby by microlensing standards. The planet-host projected\nseparation is a_perp ~ 1.2 AU. The characterization was made possible by the\nwide-field (4 sq. deg.) high cadence (Gamma = 6/hr) monitoring of the Korea\nMicrolensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), which had two of its three telescopes\nin commissioning operations at the time of the planetary anomaly. The source\ncrossing time t_* = 16 min is among the shortest ever published. The\nhigh-cadence, wide-field observations that are the hallmark of KMTNet are the\nonly way to routinely capture such short crossings. High-cadence resolution of\nshort caustic crossings will preferentially lead to mass and distance\nmeasurements for the lens. This is because the short crossing time typically\nimplies a nearby lens, which enables the measurement of additional effects\n(bright lens and/or microlens parallax). When combined with the measured\ncrossing time, these effects can yield planet/host masses and distance.\n", "  We introduce a new suite of radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy\nformation and reionization called Aurora. The Aurora simulations make use of a\nspatially adaptive radiative transfer technique that lets us accurately capture\nthe small-scale structure in the gas at the resolution of the hydrodynamics, in\ncosmological volumes. In addition to ionizing radiation, Aurora includes\ngalactic winds driven by star formation and the enrichment of the universe with\nmetals synthesized in the stars. Our reference simulation uses 2x512^3 dark\nmatter and gas particles in a box of size 25 comoving Mpc/h with a force\nsoftening scale of at most 0.28 kpc/h. It is accompanied by simulations in\nlarger and smaller boxes and at higher and lower resolution, employing up to\n2x1024^3 particles, to investigate numerical convergence. All simulations are\ncalibrated to yield simulated star formation rate (SFR) functions in close\nagreement with observational constraints at redshift z = 7 and to achieve\nreionization at z = 8.3, which is consistent with the observed optical depth to\nreionization. We focus on the design and calibration of the simulations and\npresent some first results. The median stellar metallicities of low-mass\ngalaxies at z = 6 are consistent with the metallicities of dwarf galaxies in\nthe Local Group, which are believed to have formed most of their stars at high\nredshifts. After reionization, the mean photoionization rate decreases\nsystematically with increasing resolution. This coincides with a systematic\nincrease in the abundance of neutral hydrogen absorbers in the IGM.\n", "  We argue that massless gravitons in all even dimensional de Sitter (dS)\nspacetimes higher than two admit a linear memory effect arising from their\npropagation inside the null cone. Assume that gravitational waves (GWs) are\nbeing generated by an isolated source, and over only a finite period of time.\nOutside of this time interval, suppose the shear-stress of the GW source\nbecomes negligible relative to its energy-momentum and its mass quadrupole\nmoments settle to static values. We then demonstrate, the transverse-traceless\n(TT) GW contribution to the perturbation of any dS$_{4+2n}$ written in a\nconformally flat form -- after the source has ceased and the primary GW train\nhas passed -- amounts to a spacetime constant shift in the flat metric\nproportional to the difference between the TT parts of the source's final and\ninitial mass quadrupole moments. As a byproduct, we present solutions to\nEinstein's equations linearized about de Sitter backgrounds of all dimensions\ngreater than three. We then point out there is a similar but approximate tail\ninduced linear GW memory effect in 4D matter dominated universes. Our work here\nserves to improve upon and extend the 4D cosmological results of\narXiv:1504.06337, which in turn preceded complementary work by Bieri, Garfinkle\nand Yau (arXiv:1509.01296) and by Kehagias and Riotto (arXiv:1602.02653).\n", "  We report a 20-year campaign to track the 1.8 hour photometric wave in the\nrecurrent nova T Pyxidis, using the global telescope network of the Center for\nBackyard Astrophysics. During 1996-2011, that wave was highly stable in\namplitude and waveform, resembling the orbital wave commonly seen in supersoft\nbinaries. The period, however, was found to increase on a timescale\nP/P-dot=3x10^5 years. This suggests a mass transfer rate in quiescence of\n~10^-7 M_sol/yr, in substantial agreement with the accretion rate based on the\nstar's luminosity. This is ~2000x greater than is typical for cataclysmic\nvariables of that orbital period. During the post-eruption quiescence\n(2012-2016), the star continued on its merry but mysterious way - similar\nluminosity, similar P/P-dot (2.4x10^5 years).\n  The orbital signal became vanishingly weak (<0.003 mag) near maximum light of\nthe 2011 eruption. By day 170 of the eruption, near V=11, the orbital signal\nreappeared with an amplitude of 0.005 mag. It then gradually strengthened to\nits normal 0.08 mag amplitude, as the star declined to its \"quiescent\"\nmagnitude of 15.7. During the ~1 year of invisibility and low amplitude, the\norbital signal had increased in period by 0.0054(7)%. This is probably a\nmeasure of the mass ejected in the nova outburst. For a plausible choice of\nbinary parameters, that mass is at least 3x10^-5 M_sol, and probably more. This\nrepresents >300 years of accretion at the pre-outburst rate, but the time\nbetween outbursts was only 45 years. Thus the erupting white dwarf seems to\nhave ejected at least 6x more mass than it accreted. If this eruption is\ntypical, the white dwarf must be eroding, rather than growing, in mass. Unless\nthe present series of eruptions is a short-lived episode, the binary dynamics\nappear to be a mutual suicide pact between the eroding white dwarf and the\nlow-mass secondary, excited ... . (etc., abstract continues)\n", "  Maximal kinematical invariance groups of $2d$ Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\nposition dependent mass and arbitrary potential are classified. It is\ndemonstrated that there exist seven classes of such equations possessing\nnon-equivalent continuous symmetry group. Three of these classes include\narbitrary functions while the remaining ones are defined up to arbitrary\nparameters. In particular, for the case of a constant mass the class missing in\nthe Boyer classification (Boyer C P 1974 Helv. Phys. Acta{\\bf 47}, 450) is\nindicated. A constructive test of (non)equivalence of a PDM system to a\nconstant mass system is proposed.\n", "  We derive the medium-induced, coherent gluon radiation spectrum associated\nwith the hard forward scattering of an energetic parton off a nucleus, in the\nsaturation formalism and within the Gaussian approximation for the relevant\ncorrelators of Wilson lines. The calculation reproduces the simple expression\nfor the spectrum previously obtained in the opacity expansion formalism, and\nrigorously specifies its validity range. The connection between the\ncalculations in the opacity expansion and saturation formalisms is made\napparent. This study may serve as a first step in order to implement\nconsistently induced coherent energy loss and gluon shadowing in\n`saturation-based models' of hadron nuclear suppression in proton-nucleus\ncollisions.\n", "  Unlike dry granular materials, a dense granular suspension like cornstarch in\nwater can strongly resist extensional flows. At low extension rates, such a\nsuspension behaves like a viscous liquid, but rapid extension results in a\nresponse where stresses far exceed the predictions of lubrication hydrodynamics\nand capillarity. To understand this remarkable mechanical response, we\nexperimentally measure the normal force imparted by a large bulk of the\nsuspension on a plate moving vertically upward at a controlled velocity. We\nobserve that above a velocity threshold, the peak force increases by orders of\nmagnitude. Using fast ultrasound imaging we map out the local velocity profiles\ninside the suspension which reveal the formation of a growing jammed region\nunder rapid extension. This region interacts with the rigid boundaries of the\ncontainer through strong velocity gradients, suggesting a direct connection to\nthe recently proposed shear-jamming mechanism.\n", "  Two-thirds of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) show soft X-ray\nabsorption in excess of the Milky Way. The column densities of metals inferred\nfrom UV and optical spectra differ from those derived from soft X-ray spectra,\nat times by an order of magnitude, with the latter being higher. The origin of\nthe soft X-ray absorption excess observed in GRB X-ray afterglow spectra\nremains a heavily debated issue, which has resulted in numerous investigations\non the effect of hot material both internal and external to the GRB host galaxy\non our X-ray afterglow observations. Nevertheless, all models proposed so far\nhave either only been able to account for a subset of our observations (i.e. at\nz > 2), or they have required fairly extreme conditions to be present within\nthe absorbing material. In this paper, we investigate the absorption of the GRB\nafterglow by a collisionally ionised and turbulent interstellar medium (ISM).\nWe find that a dense (3 per cubic centimeters) collisionally ionised ISM could\nproduce UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities that differ by a\nfactor of 10, however the UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities\nfor such sightlines and are 2-3 orders of magnitude lower in comparison to the\nGRB afterglow spectra. For those GRBs with a larger soft X-ray excess of up to\nan order of magnitude, the contribution in absorption from a turbulent ISM as\nconsidered here would ease the required conditions of additional absorbing\ncomponents, such as the GRB circumburst medium and intergalactic medium.\n", "  Recently, deviations in flavor observables of B -> D(*) tau nu have been\nshown between the predictions in the Standard Model and the experimental\nresults reported by BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations. One of the solutions\nto this anomaly is obtained in a class of leptoquark model with a scalar\nleptoquark boson S_1, which is a SU(3)_c triplet and SU(2)_L singlet particle\nwith -1/3 hypercharge interacting with a quark-lepton pair. With well-adjusted\ncouplings, this model can explain the anomaly and be compatible with all flavor\nconstraints. In such a case, the S_1 boson can be pair-produced at CERN's Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) and subsequently decay as S_1 -> t tau, b nu, c tau. This\npaper explores the current 8 and 13 TeV constraints, as well as the detailed\nprospects at 14 TeV, of this flavor-motivated S_1 model. From the current\navailable 8 and 13 TeV LHC searches, we obtain constraints on the S_1 boson\nmass for M_{S_1} < 400 GeV - 640 GeV depending on values of the leptoquark\ncouplings to fermions. Then we study future prospects for this scenario at the\n14 TeV LHC using detailed cut analyses and evaluate exclusion/discovery\npotentials for the flavor-motivated S_1 leptoquark model from searches for the\n(b nu) (b nu) and (c tau) (c tau) final states. In the latter case, we consider\nseveral scenarios for the identification of charm jets. As a result, we find\nthat the S_1 leptoquark origin of the B -> D(*) tau nu anomaly can be probed\nwith mass less than around 600/800 GeV at the 14 TeV LHC with 300/3000 fb^-1 of\naccumulated data.\n", "  The coronagraph is an instrument enables the investigation of faint features\nin the vicinity of the Sun, particularly coronal mass ejections (CMEs). So far\ncoronagraphic observations have been mainly used to determine the geometric and\nkinematic parameters of CMEs. Here, we introduce a new method for the\ndetermination of CME temperature using a two filter (4025 A and 3934 A)\ncoronagraph system. The thermal motion of free electrons in CMEs broadens the\nabsorption lines in the optical spectra that are produced by the Thomson\nscattering of visible light originating in the photosphere, which affects the\nintensity ratio at two different wavelengths. Thus the CME temperature can be\ninferred from the intensity ratio measured by the two filter coronagraph\nsystem. We demonstrate the method by invoking the graduated cylindrical shell\n(GCS) model for the 3 dimensional CME density distribution and discuss its\nsignificance.\n", "  The Toothbrush radio relic associated the merging cluster 1RXS J060303.3 is\npresumed to be produced by relativistic electrons accelerated at merger-driven\nshocks. Since the shock Mach number inferred from the observed radio spectral\nindex, $M_{radio}\\approx 2.8$, is larger than that estimated from X-ray\nobservations, $M_{X-ray}\\lesssim 1.5$, we consider the re-acceleration model in\nwhich a weak shock of $M_s\\approx 1.2-1.5$ sweeps through the intracluster\nplasma with a preshock population of relativistic electrons. We find the models\nwith a power-law momentum spectrum with the slope, $s\\approx 4.6$, and the\ncutoff Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_{e,c}\\approx 7-8\\times 10^4$ can reproduce\nreasonably well the observed profiles of radio fluxes and integrated radio\nspectrum of the head portion of the Toothbrush relic. This study confirms the\nstrong connection between the ubiquitous presence of fossil relativistic plasma\noriginated from AGNs and the shock-acceleration model of radio relics in the\nintracluster medium.\n", "  Quantum steering is a relatively simple test for quantumness of correlations,\nproving that the values of quantum-mechanical measurement outcomes come into\nbeing only in the act of measurement. By exploiting quantum correlations Alice\ncan influence -- steer -- Bob's physical system in a way inaccessible in\nclassical world, leading to violation of some inequalities. Demonstrating this\nand similar quantum effects for systems of increasing size, approaching even\nthe classical limit, is a long-standing challenging problem. Here we provide\nexperimentally feasible signature of unbounded violation of a steering\ninequality. We derive its universal form where tolerance for\nmeasurement-setting-errors is explicitly build-in by means of the\nDeutsch-Maassen-Uffink uncertainty relation. Then, generalizing the mutual\nunbiasedness, we apply the inequality to the multi-singlet and multi-particle\nbipartite Bell-state. However, the method is general and opens the possibility\nof employing multi-particle bipartite steering for randomness certification and\ndevelopment of quantum technologies, e.g.\\ random access codes.\n", "  We derive laws for the distribution of quantum steering among different\nparties in multipartite Gaussian states under Gaussian measurements. We prove\nthat a monogamy relation akin to the generalized Coffman-Kundu-Wootters\ninequality holds quantitatively for a recently introduced measure of Gaussian\nsteering. We then define the residual Gaussian steering, stemming from the\nmonogamy inequality, as an indicator of collective steering-type correlations.\nFor pure three-mode Gaussian states, the residual acts a quantifier of genuine\nmultipartite steering, and is interpreted operationally in terms of the\nguaranteed key rate in the task of secure quantum secret sharing. Optimal\nresource states for the latter protocol are identified, and their possible\nexperimental implementation discussed. Our results pin down the role of\nmultipartite steering for quantum communication.\n", "  We study the equilibration properties of classical integrable field theories\nat a finite energy density, with a time evolution that starts from initial\nconditions far from equilibrium. These classical field theories may be regarded\nas quantum field theories in the regime of high occupation numbers. This\nobservation permits to recover the classical quantities from the quantum ones\nby taking a proper $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ limit. In particular, the time\naverages of the classical theories can be expressed in terms of a suitable\nversion of the LeClair-Mussardo formula relative to the Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble. For the purposes of handling time averages, our approach provides a\nsolution of the problem of the {\\em infinite gap solutions} of the Inverse\nScattering Method.\n", "  We report the discovery of eight new giant planets, and updated orbits for\nfour known planets, orbiting dwarf and subgiant stars using the CORALIE, HARPS,\nand MIKE instruments as part of the Calan-Hertfordshire Extrasolar Planet\nSearch. The planets have masses in the range 1.1-5.4MJs, orbital periods from\n40-2900 days, and eccentricities from 0.0-0.6. They include a double-planet\nsystem orbiting the most massive star in our sample (HD147873), two eccentric\ngiant planets (HD128356b and HD154672b), and a rare 14 Herculis analogue\n(HD224538b). We highlight some population correlations from the sample of\nradial velocity detected planets orbiting nearby stars, including the mass\nfunction exponential distribution, confirmation of the growing body of evidence\nthat low-mass planets tend to be found orbiting more metal-poor stars than\ngiant planets, and a possible period-metallicity correlation for planets with\nmasses >0.1MJ, based on a metallicity difference of 0.16 dex between the\npopulation of planets with orbital periods less than 100 days and those with\norbital periods greater than 100 days.\n", "  Time reversal and spin flip are discrete symmetry operations of substantial\nimport to quantum information and quantum computation. Spin flip arises in the\ncontext of separability, quantification of entanglement and the construction of\nUniversal NOT gates. The present work investigates the relationship between the\nquantum state of a multiqubit system represented by the Discrete Wigner\nFunction (DWFs) and its spin-flipped counterpart. The two are shown to be\nrelated through a Hadamard matrix that is independent of the choice of the\nquantum net used for the tomographic reconstruction of the DWF. These results\nwould be of interest to cases involving the direct tomographic reconstruction\nof the DWF from experimental data and in the analysis of entanglement related\nproperties purely in terms of the Discrete Wigner function.\n", "  We study the stability of filaments in equilibrium between gravity and\ninternal as well as external pressure using the grid based AMR-code RAMSES. A\nhomogeneous, straight cylinder below a critical line mass is marginally stable.\nHowever, if the cylinder is bent, e.g. with a slight sinusoidal perturbation,\nan otherwise stable configuration starts to oscillate, is triggered into\nfragmentation and collapses. This previously unstudied behavior allows a\nfilament to fragment at any given scale, as long as it has slight bends. We\ncall this process `geometrical fragmentation'. In our realization the spacing\nbetween the cores matches the wavelength of the sinusoidal perturbation,\nwhereas up to now, filaments were thought to be only fragmenting on the\ncharacteristical scale set by the mass-to-line ratio. Using first principles,\nwe derive the oscillation period as well as the collapse timescale\nanalytically. To enable a direct comparison with observations, we study the\nline-of-sight velocity for different inclinations. We show that the overall\noscillation pattern can hide the infall signature of cores.\n", "  The Kalb-Ramond field, identifiable with bulk torsion in a five-dimensional\nRandall Sundrum (RS) scenario, has Chern-Simons interactions with gauge bosons,\nfrom the requirement of gauge anomaly cancellation. Its lowest Kaluza Klein\n(KK) mode on the visible 3-brane can be identified with a spin-0 CP-odd field,\nnamely, the axion. By virtue of the warped geometry and Chern-Simons couplings,\nthis axion has unsuppressed interactions with gauge bosons in contrast to\nultra-suppressed interactions with fermions. The ensuing dynamics can lead to a\npeak in the diphoton spectrum, which could be observed at the LHC, subject to\nthe prominence of the signal. Moreover, the results can be numerically\njustified when the warp factor is precisely in the range required for\nstabilization of the electroweak scale.\n", "  We present the development of a photometrically selected massive galaxy\ncatalog, targeting Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and massive blue galaxies at\nredshifts $z\\geq 0.55$. Massive galaxy candidates are selected using\ninfrared/optical color-color cuts, with optical data from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) and infrared data from \"unWISE\" forced photometry derived from\nthe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The selection method is based\non previously developed techniques to select LRGs with $z>0.5$, and is\noptimized using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The catalog\ncontains 16,191,145 objects, selected over the full SDSS DR10 footprint. The\nredshift distribution of the resulting catalog is estimated using spectroscopic\nredshifts from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and photometric redshifts from\nCOSMOS. Restframe $U-B$ colors from DEEP2 are used to estimate LRG selection\nefficiency. Using DEEP2, the resulting catalog has average redshift $z=0.65$,\nwith standard deviation $\\sigma = 2.0$, and average restframe $U-B=1.0$, with\nstandard deviation $\\sigma=0.27$. Using COSMOS, the resulting catalog has\naverage redshift $z=0.60$, with standard deviation $\\sigma = 1.8$. We estimate\n34% of the catalog to be blue galaxies with $z\\geq0.55$. An estimated 9.6% of\nselected objects are blue sources with redshift $z<0.55$. Stellar contamination\nis estimated to be 1.8%.\n", "  We report that in cylindrical nanorods skyrmion chains, i.e.,\nthree-dimensional spin textures, emerge dynamically, as revealed by\nmicromagnetic simulations. The skyrmion-chain state occurs when the diameter of\nthe rod is larger than the helical pitch length of the material, and the number\nof skyrmions on the chain is proportional to the length of the nanorod. This\nfinding provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry and\nskyrmionic symmetry, and shows how spatial confinement can stabilize\nspontaneous topological spin textures.\n", "  Quantum state tomography via local measurements is an efficient tool for\ncharacterizing quantum states. However it requires that the original global\nstate be uniquely determined (UD) by its local reduced density matrices (RDMs).\nIn this work we demonstrate for the first time a class of states that are UD by\ntheir RDMs under the assumption that the global state is pure, but fail to be\nUD in the absence of that assumption. This discovery allows us to classify\nquantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each\nclass be treated distinctly in the practice of simplifying quantum state\ntomography. Additionally we experimentally test the feasibility and stability\nof performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for\neach class. These theoretical and experimental results advance the project of\nperforming efficient and accurate quantum state tomography in practice.\n", "  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) has recently\ndiscovered gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by merging black hole binaries. We\nexamine whether future GW detections may identify triple companions of merging\nbinaries. Such a triple companion causes variations in the GW signal due to (1)\nthe varying path length along the line of sight during the orbit around the\ncenter of mass, (2) relativistic beaming, Doppler, and gravitational redshift,\n(3) the variation of the \"light\"-travel time in the gravitational field of the\ntriple companion, and (4) secular variations of the orbital elements. We find\nthat the prospects for detecting the triple companion are the highest for\nlow-mass compact object binaries which spend the longest time in the LIGO\nfrequency band. In particular, for merging neutron star binaries, LIGO may\ndetect a white dwarf or M-dwarf perturber at signal to noise ratio of 8, if it\nis within 0.4 solar radius distance from the binary and the system is within a\ndistance of 100 Mpc. Stellar mass (supermassive) black hole perturbers may be\ndetected at a factor 5x (1000x) larger separations. Such pertubers in orbit\naround the merging binary emit GWs at frequencies above 1 mHz detectable by the\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) in coincidence.\n", "  The B-mode polarisation power spectrum in the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) is about four orders of magnitude fainter than the CMB temperature power\nspectrum. Any instrumental imperfections that couple temperature fluctuations\nto B-mode polarisation must therefore be carefully controlled and/or removed.\nWe investigate the role that a scan strategy can have in mitigating certain\ncommon systematics by averaging systematic errors down with many crossing\nangles. We present approximate analytic forms for the error on the recovered\nB-mode power spectrum that would result from differential gain, differential\npointing and differential ellipticity for the case where two detector pairs are\nused in a polarisation experiment. We use these analytic predictions to search\nthe parameter space of common satellite scan strategies in order to identify\nthose features of a scan strategy that have most impact in mitigating\nsystematic effects. As an example we go on to identify a scan strategy suitable\nfor the CMB satellite proposed for the ESA M5 call. considering the practical\nconsiderations of fuel requirement, data rate and the relative orientation of\nthe telescope to the earth. Having chosen a scan strategy we then go on to\ninvestigate the suitability of the scan strategy.\n", "  Tuning and stabilising topological states, such as Weyl semimetals, Dirac\nsemimetals, or topological insulators, is emerging as one of the major topics\nin materials science. Periodic driving of many-body systems offers a platform\nto design Floquet states of matter with tunable electronic properties on\nultrafast time scales. Here we show by first principles calculations how\nfemtosecond laser pulses with circularly polarised light can be used to switch\nbetween Weyl semimetal, Dirac semimetal, and topological insulator states in a\nprototypical 3D Dirac material, Na$_3$Bi. Our findings are general and apply to\nany 3D Dirac semimetal. We discuss the concept of time-dependent bands and\nsteering of Floquet-Weyl points (Floquet-WPs), and demonstrate how light can\nenhance topological protection against lattice perturbations. Our work has\npotential practical implications for the ultrafast switching of materials\nproperties, like optical band gaps or anomalous magnetoresistance. Moreover, we\nintroduce Floquet time-dependent density functional theory (Floquet-TDDFT) as a\ngeneral and robust first principles method for predictive Floquet engineering\nof topological states of matter.\n", "  In this letter, we consider the possibility of reconciling metric theories of\ngravitation with violation of the conservation of energy-momentum. Under some\ncircumstances, this can be achieved in the context of unimodular gravity, and\nit leads to the emergence of an effective cosmological constant in Einstein's\nequation. We specifically investigate two potential sources of energy\nnon-conservation ---non-unitary modifications of quantum mechanics, and\nphenomenological models motivated by quantum gravity theories with spacetime\ndiscreteness at the Planck scale--- and show that such locally negligible\nphenomena can nevertheless become relevant at the cosmological scale.\n", "  We propose a physically-realisable biochemical device that is coupled to a\nbiochemical reservoir of mutual information, fuel molecules and a chemical\nbath. Mutual information allows work to be done on the bath even when the fuel\nmolecules appear to be in equilibrium; alternatively, mutual information can be\ncreated by driving from the fuel or the bath. The system exhibits diverse\nbehaviour, including a regime in which the information, despite increasing\nduring the reaction, enhances the extracted work. We further demonstrate that a\nmodified device can function without the need for external manipulation,\neliminating the need for a complex and potentially costly control.\n", "  Starting from the continuity equation for the magnetization in time-dependent\nspin-density functional theory, we derive an expression for the effective\ntime-dependent magnetic fields driving the out-of-equilibrium spin dynamics in\nmagnetic systems. We evaluate these, so called, kinetic magnetic fields in the\nultrafast demagnetization response to optical pulse excitations of\nferromagnetic iron-based materials, namely Fe$_6$ cluster and bulk bcc Fe. We\nidentify spatial \"hot spots\" where the demagnetization is particularly enhanced\nas a result of the increased kinetic torque.\n", "  This study considers the operator $\\hat{T}$ corresponding to the classical\nspacetime four-volume $\\tilde{T}$ (on-shell) of a finite patch of spacetime in\nthe context of Unimodular Loop Quantum Cosmology for the homogeneous and\nisotropic model with flat spatial sections and without matter sources. Since\nthe spacetime four-volume is canonically conjugate to the cosmological\n\"constant\", the operator $\\hat{T}$ is constructed by solving its canonical\ncommutation relation with $\\hat{\\Lambda}$ - the operator corresponding to the\nclassical cosmological constant on-shell $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. This conjugacy,\nalong with the action of $\\hat{T}$ on definite volume states reducing to\n$\\tilde{T}$, allows us to interpret that $\\hat{T}$ is indeed a quantum\nspacetime four-volume operator. The discrete spectrum of $\\hat{T}$ is\ncalculated by considering the set of all $\\tau$'s where the eigenvalue equation\nhas a solution $\\Phi_{\\tau}$ in the domain of $\\hat{T}$. It turns out that,\nupon assigning the maximal domain $D(\\hat{T})$ to $\\hat{T}$, we have\n$\\Phi_{\\tau}\\in D(\\hat{T})$ for all $\\tau\\in\\mathbb{C}$ so that the spectrum of\n$\\hat{T}$ is purely discrete and is the entire complex plane. A family of\noperators $\\hat{T}^{(b_0,\\phi_0)}$ was also considered as possible self-adjoint\nversions of $\\hat{T}$. They represent the restrictions of $\\hat{T}$ on their\nrespective domains $D(\\hat{T}^{(b_0,\\phi_0)})$ which are just the maximal\ndomain with additional quasi-periodic conditions. Their possible\nself-adjointness is motivated by their discrete spectra only containing real\nand discrete numbers $\\tau_m$ for $m=0,\\pm1,\\pm2,...$.\n", "  We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the dependence of\nthe superconductivity of the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ on\nanisotropic strain. Novel piezoelectric apparatus is used to apply uniaxial\npressures of up to $\\sim$1~GPa along a $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ direction\n($a$-axis) of the crystal lattice. $T_c$ increases from 1.5~K in unstrained\nmaterial to 3.4~K at compression by $\\approx$0.6\\%, then falls steeply. The\n$c$-axis upper critical field for the strained $T_c$ = 3.4~K material is a\nfactor of twenty larger than that of the unstrained crystal, whereas the\nin-plane ($a$-axis) critical field increases by only a factor of three.\nFirst-principles electronic structure calculations give evidence that the\nobserved maximum $T_c$ occurs at or near a Lifshitz transition when the Fermi\nlevel passes through a van Hove singularity. Finally, we perform order\nparameter analyses using three-band renormalization group calculations. These,\ncombined with the unexpectedly low in-plane critical field, open the\npossibility that the highly strained $T_c$=3.4~K Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has an even-\nrather than an odd-parity order parameter. Potential implications such as a\ntransition at nonzero strain between odd- and even-parity order parameters are\ndiscussed.\n", "  B20 phase magnetic materials, such as FeGe, have been of significant\ninterests in recent years because they enable magnetic skyrmions, which can\npotentially lead to low energy cost spintronic applications. One major effort\nin this emerging field is the stabilization of skyrmions at room temperature\nand zero external magnetic field. We report the growth of phase-pure FeGe\nepitaxial thin films on Si(111) substrates by ultrahigh vacuum off-axis\nsputtering. The high crystalline quality of the FeGe films was confirmed by\nx-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Hall effect\nmeasurements reveal strong topological Hall effect after subtracting out the\nordinary and anomalous Hall effects, demonstrating the formation of high\ndensity skyrmions in FeGe films between 5 and 275 K. In particular, substantial\ntopological Hall effect was observed at zero magnetic field, showing a robust\nskyrmion phase without the need of an external magnetic field.\n", "  The paper presents an analysis of properties of populations of blue\nstragglers (BSs) in evolving globular clusters, based on numerical simulations\ndone with the MOCCA code for various initial globular clusters conditions.\n  We find that various populations of BSs strongly depend on the initial\nsemi-major axes distributions. With a significant number of compact binaries,\nthe number of evolutionary BSs can be also significant. In turn, for semi-major\naxes distributions preferring binaries with wider orbits, dynamical BSs are the\ndominant ones. Their formation scenario is very distinct: for wide binaries the\nnumber of dynamical interactions is significantly larger. Most interactions are\nweak and increase only slightly the eccentricities. However, due to a large\nnumber of such interactions, the eccentricities of a number of binaries finally\nget so large that the stars collide.\n  We study how larger initial clusters' concentrations influence the BSs.\nBesides the expected increase of the number of dynamically created BSs (for\ndenser GCs the probabilities of strong dynamical interactions and collisions\nare higher), we find that the number of the evolutionary BSs is not affected\neven by very high initial concentrations. This has a very important implication\non observations - it supports the theory that the evolutionary BSs are the\nresult of the unperturbed evolution of the primordial binaries.\n  In addition, the paper presents the evolution of the ratio between the number\nof BSs in binaries and as single stars R_B/S. For a vast diversity of models,\nthe ratio R_B/S approaches the value ~0.4. Additionally, we identified two\nsubgroups which differ in the initial semi-major axes distributions. The first\ngroup starts with a high ratio R_B/S, it decreases with time and settles around\n0.4. The second group starts with lower values of the ratio R_B/S ... . (etc.,\nabstract continues)\n", "  Signatures of \"evaporative\" winds from exo-planets on short (hot) orbits\naround their host star have been observed in a number of systems. In this paper\nwe present global AMR simulations that track the launching of the winds, their\nexpansion through the circumstellar environment, and their interaction with a\nstellar wind. We focus on purely hydrodynamic flows including the anisotropy of\nthe wind launching and explore the orbital/fluid dynamics of the resulting\nflows in detail. In particular we find that a combination of the tidal and\nCoriolis forces strongly distorts the planetary \"Parker\" wind creating\n\"up-orbit\" and \"down-orbit\" streams. We characterize the flows in terms of\ntheir orbital elements which change depending on their launch position on the\nplanet. We find that the anisotropy in the atmospheric temperature leads to\nsignificant backflow on to the planet. The planetary wind interacts strongly\nwith the stellar wind creating instabilities that cause eventual deposition of\nplanetary gas onto the star. We present synthetic observations of both transit\nand absorption line-structure for our simulations. For our initial conditions,\nwe find that the orbiting wind material produces absorption signatures at\nsignificant distances from the planet and substantial orbit to orbit\nvariability. Ly-{\\alpha} absorption shows red and blueshifted features out to\n70 km/s. Finally, using semi-analytic models we constrain the effect of\nradiation pressure, given the approximation of uniform stellar absorption.\n", "  The continuous interest in the social network area contributes to the fast\ndevelopment of this field. The new possibilities of obtaining and storing data\nfacilitate deeper analysis of the entire social network, extracted social\ngroups and single individuals as well. One of the most interesting research\ntopic is the network dynamics and dynamics of social groups in particular, it\nmeans analysis of group evolution over time. It is the natural step forward\nafter social community extraction. Having communities extracted, appropriate\nknowledge and methods for dynamic analysis may be applied in order to identify\nchanges as well as to predict the future of all or some selected groups.\nFurthermore, knowing the most probably change of a given group some additional\nsteps may be performed in order to change this predicted future according to\nspecific needs. Such ability would be a powerful tool in the hands of human\nresource managers, personnel recruitment, marketing, telecommunication\ncompanies, etc.\n", "  A stochastic subgrid-scale parameterization based on the Ruelle's response\ntheory and proposed in Wouters and Lucarini [2012] is tested in the context of\na low-order coupled ocean-atmosphere model for which a part of the atmospheric\nmodes are considered as unresolved. A natural separation of the phase-space\ninto an invariant set and its complement allows for an analytical derivation of\nthe different terms involved in the parameterization, namely the average, the\nfluctuation and the long memory terms. In this case, the fluctuation term is an\nadditive stochastic noise. Its application to the low-order system reveals that\na considerable correction of the low-frequency variability along the invariant\nsubset can be obtained, provided that the coupling is sufficiently weak. This\nnew approach of scale separation opens new avenues of subgrid-scale\nparameterizations in multiscale systems used for climate forecasts.\n", "  By considering the 3-3-1 and the left-right symmetric models as low energy\neffective theories of the $SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(3)_L\\otimes SU(3)_R$~(for short\n$[SU(3)]^3$) gauge group, alternative versions of these models are found. The\nnew neutral gauge bosons of the universal 3-3-1 model and its flipped versions\nare presented; also, the left-right symmetric model and its flipped variants\nare studied. Our analysis shows that there are two flipped versions of the\nuniversal 3-3-1 model, with the particularity that both of them have the same\nweak charges. For the left-right symmetric model we also found two flipped\nversions; one of them new in the literature which, unlike those of the 3-3-1,\nrequires a dedicated study of its electroweak properties. For all the models\nanalyzed, the couplings of the $Z'$ bosons to the standard model fermions are\nreported. The explicit form of the null space of the vector boson mass matrix\nfor an arbitrary Higgs tensor and gauge group is also presented. In the general\nframework of the $[SU(3)]^3$ gauge group, and by using the LHC experimental\nresults and EW precision data, limits on the $Z'$ mass and the mixing angle\nbetween $Z$ and the new gauge bosons $Z'$ are obtained. The general results\ncall for very small mixing angles in the range $10^{-3}$ radians and $M_{Z'}>$\n2.5 TeV.\n", "  Einstein's General theory of relativity permits spacetime singularities,\nwhere null geodesic congruences focus in the presence of matter, which\nsatisfies an appropriate energy condition. In this paper, we provide a minimal\ndefocusing condition for null congruences without assuming any Ansatz-dependent\nbackground solution. The two important criteria are: (1) an additional scalar\ndegree of freedom, besides the massless graviton must be introduced into the\nspacetime; and (2) an infinite derivative theory of gravity is required in\norder to avoid tachyons or ghosts in the graviton propagator. In this regard,\nour analysis strengthens earlier arguments for constructing non-singular\nbouncing cosmologies within an infinite derivative theory of gravity, without\nassuming any Ansatz to solve the full equations of motion.\n", "  We present a dynamical model for gas transport, star formation, and winds in\nthe nuclear regions of galaxies, focusing on the Milky Way's Central Molecular\nZone (CMZ). In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals. During quiescence the gas in the ring\nis not fully cleared, but is driven out of a self-gravitating state by the\nmomentum injected by expanding supernova remnants. Starbursts also drive a wind\noff the star-forming ring, with a time-averaged mass flux comparable to the\nstar formation rate. We show that our model agrees well with the observed\nproperties of the CMZ, and places it near a star formation minimum within the\nevolutionary cycle. We argue that such cycles of bursty star formation and\nwinds should be ubiquitous in the nuclei of barred spiral galaxies, and show\nthat the resulting distribution of galactic nuclei on the Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation is in good agreement with that observed in nearby galaxies.\n", "  Globular clusters which exhibit chemical and dynamical complexity have been\nsuggested to be the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies (e.g., M54, $\\omega$\nCen). We use $N$-body simulations of nuclear star clusters forming via the\nmergers of star clusters to explore the persistence of substructure in the\nphase space. We find that the observed level of differentiation is difficult to\nreconcile with the observed if nuclear clusters form wholly out of the mergers\nof star clusters. Only the star clusters that merged most recently retain\nsufficiently distinct kinematics to be distinguishable from the rest of the\nnuclear cluster though the critical factor is the number of merger events not\nthe elapsed time. In situ star formation must therefore be included to explain\nthe observed properties of nuclear star clusters, in good agreement with\nprevious results.\n", "  We present a numerical method which evolves a two-temperature, magnetized,\nradiative, accretion flow around a black hole, within the framework of general\nrelativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics. As implemented in the code KORAL,\nthe gas consists of two sub-components -- ions and electrons -- which share the\nsame dynamics but experience independent, relativistically consistent,\nthermodynamical evolution. The electrons and ions are heated independently\naccording to a standard prescription from the literature for\nmagnetohydrodynamical turbulent dissipation. Energy exchange between the\nparticle species via Coulomb collisions is included. In addition, electrons\ngain and lose energy and momentum by absorbing and emitting synchrotron and\nbremsstrahlung radiation, and through Compton scattering. All evolution\nequations are handled within a fully covariant framework in the relativistic\nfixed-metric spacetime of the black hole. Numerical results are presented for\nfive models of low luminosity black hole accretion. In the case of a model with\na mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}\\sim10^{-8} \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$, we find that\nradiation has a negligible effect on either the dynamics or the thermodynamics\nof the accreting gas. In contrast, a model with a larger $\\dot{M}\\sim 4\\times\n10^{-4} \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ behaves very differently. The accreting gas is much\ncooler and the flow is geometrically less thick, though it is not quite a thin\naccretion disk.\n", "  The Robo-AO \\textit{Kepler} Planetary Candidate Survey is observing every\n\\textit{Kepler} planet candidate host star with laser adaptive optics imaging\nto search for blended nearby stars, which may be physically associated\ncompanions and/or responsible for transit false positives. We present in this\npaper the results of our search for stars nearby 1629 \\textit{Kepler} planet\ncandidate hosts. With survey sensitivity to objects as close as $\\sim$0.15\" and\nmagnitude differences $\\Delta$m$\\le$6, we find 223 stars in the vicinity of 206\ntarget KOIs; 209 of these nearby stars have not previously been imaged in high\nresolution. We measure an overall nearby-star probability for \\textit{Kepler}\nplanet candidates of 12.6\\%$\\pm$0.9\\% at separations between 0.15\" and 4.0\".\nParticularly interesting KOI systems are discussed, including 23 stars with\ndetected companions which host rocky, habitable zone candidates, and five new\ncandidate planet-hosting quadruple star systems. We explore the broad\ncorrelations between planetary systems and stellar binarity using the combined\ndataset of Baranec et al. (2016) and this paper. Our previous 2$\\sigma$ result\nof a low binary fraction of KOIs hosting close-in giant planets is less\napparent in this larger dataset. We also find a significant correlation between\nbinary fraction and KOI number, suggesting possible variation between early and\nlate \\textit{Kepler} data releases.\n", "  Novel materials with nontrivial electronic and photonic band topology are\ncrucial for realizing novel devices with low power consumption and heat\ndissipation, and quantum computing free of decoherence. Here using\nfirst-principles approach, we predict a class of ternary transition metal\nchalcogenides (TTMC) MM'Te$_4$ exhibits dual topological characteristics:\nquantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators in their 2D monolayers and topological Weyl\nsemimetals in their 3D noncentrosymmetric crystals upon van der Waals (vdW)\nstacking. Remarkably, we find that one can create and annihilate Weyl fermions,\nand realize the transition between Type-I and Type-II Weyl fermions by tuning\nvdW interlayer spacing. Our calculations show that they possess excellent\nthermodynamic stability and weak interlayer binding, implying their great\npotentials for experimental synthesis, direct exfoliation and vdW\nheterostacking. Moreover, their ternary nature will offer more tunability for\nelectronic structure by controlling different stoichiometry and valence\ncharges. Our findings provide an ideal materials platform for realizing QSH\neffect and exploring topological phase transition, and will open up a variety\nof new opportunities for two-dimensional materials and topological materials\nresearch.\n", "  We have investigated surface acoustic wave propagation in Ni/LiNbO$_3$ hybrid\ndevices. We have found the absorption and phase velocity are dependent on the\nsign of wave vector in a device, which indicates the nonreciprocal propagation\ncharacteristic of systems with time reversal and spatial inversion\nsimultaneously broken symmetries. The nonreciprocity is reversed by the\n180$^\\circ$ rotation of magnetic field. Nonreciprocity seems largely dependent\non the shape of ferromagnetic Ni film. The origin of these observations is\nascribed to film shape dependent magnetoelastic coupling.\n", "  In this paper we study the triaxial properties of dark matter haloes of a\nwide range of masses extracted from a set of cosmological N-body simulations.\nWe measure the shape at different distances from the halo centre (characterised\nby different overdensity thresholds), both in three and in two dimensions. We\ndiscuss how halo triaxiality increases with mass, redshift and distance from\nthe halo centre. We also examine how the orientation of the different\nellipsoids are aligned with each other and what is the gradient in internal\nshapes for halos with different virial configurations. Our findings highlight\nthat the internal part of the halo retains memory of the violent formation\nprocess keeping the major axis oriented toward the preferential direction of\nthe in-falling material while the outer part becomes rounder due to continuous\nisotropic merging events. This effect is clearly evident in high mass haloes -\nwhich formed more recently - while it is more blurred in low mass haloes. We\npresent simple distributions that may be used as priors for various mass\nreconstruction algorithms, operating in different wavelengths, in order to\nrecover a more complex and realistic dark matter distribution of isolated and\nrelaxed systems.\n", "  Assuming: fast radio bursts (FRBs) are produced by neutron stars at\ncosmological distances; FRB rate tracks core-collapse supernova rate; and all\nFRBs repeat with a universal energy distribution function (EDF) dN/dE ~\nE^(-beta) with a high-end cutoff at burst energy E_max. We find that\nobservations so far are consistent with a universal EDF with a power-law index\n1.5 < beta < 2.2, high-end cutoff E_max/E_0 > 30 and normalization N_0 < 2 per\nday; where N_0 is the integrated rate above the reference burst energy E_0 =\n1.2e39 f_r^(-1) erg (f_r is the radio emission efficiency). Implications of\nsuch an EDF are discussed.\n", "  The classical approach to spacetime singularities leads to a simplified\ndynamics in which spatial derivatives become unimportant compared to time\nderivatives, and thus each spatial point essentially becomes uncoupled from its\nneighbors. This uncoupled dynamics leads to sharp features (called \"spikes\") as\nfollows: particular spatial points follow an exceptional dynamical path that\ndiffers from that of their neighbors, with the consequence that, in the\nneighborhood of these exceptional points, the spatial profile becomes ever more\nsharp. Spikes are consequences of the BKL-type oscillatory evolution towards\ngeneric singularities of spacetime. Do spikes persist when the spacetime\ndynamics is treated using quantum mechanics? To address this question, we treat\na Hamiltonian system that describes the dynamics of the approach to the\nsingularity and consider how to quantize that system. We argue that this\nparticular system is best treated using an affine quantization approach (rather\nthan the more familiar methods of canonical quantization) and we set up the\nformalism needed for this treatment. Our investigation, based on this affine\napproach, shows the nonexistence of quantum spikes.\n", "  The set-up of the initial conditions in cosmological N-body simulations is\nusually implemented by rescaling the desired low-redshift linear power spectrum\nto the required starting redshift consistently with the Newtonian evolution of\nthe simulation. The implementation of this practical solution requires more\ncare in the context of massive neutrino cosmologies, mainly because of the\nnon-trivial scale-dependence of the linear growth that characterises these\nmodels. In this work we consider a simple two-fluid, Newtonian approximation\nfor cold dark matter and massive neutrinos perturbations that can reproduce the\ncold matter linear evolution predicted by Boltzmann codes such as CAMB or CLASS\nwith a 0.1% accuracy or below for all redshift relevant to nonlinear structure\nformation. We use this description, in the first place, to quantify the\nsystematic errors induced by several approximations often assumed in numerical\nsimulations, including the typical set-up of the initial conditions for massive\nneutrino cosmologies adopted in previous works. We then take advantage of the\nflexibility of this approach to rescale the late-time linear power spectra to\nthe simulation initial redshift, in order to be as consistent as possible with\nthe dynamics of the N-body code and the approximations it assumes. We implement\nour method in a public code providing the initial displacements and velocities\nfor cold dark matter and neutrino particles that will allow accurate, i.e.\none-percent level, numerical simulations for this cosmological scenario.\n", "  Gravitational time delays, observed in strong lens systems where the variable\nbackground source is multiply-imaged by a massive galaxy in the foreground,\nprovide direct measurements of cosmological distance that are very\ncomplementary to other cosmographic probes. The success of the technique\ndepends on the availability and size of a suitable sample of lensed quasars or\nsupernovae, precise measurements of the time delays, accurate modeling of the\ngravitational potential of the main deflector, and our ability to characterize\nthe distribution of mass along the line of sight to the source. We review the\nprogress made during the last 15 years, during which the first competitive\ncosmological inferences with time delays were made, and look ahead to the\npotential of significantly larger lens samples in the near future.\n", "  We present a first-principles-based coronal mass ejection (CME) model\nsuitable for both scientific and operational purposes by combining a global\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solar wind model with a flux rope-driven CME model.\nRealistic CME events are simulated self-consistently with high fidelity and\nforecasting capability by constraining initial flux rope parameters with\nobservational data from GONG, SOHO/LASCO, and STEREO/COR. We automate this\nprocess so that minimum manual intervention is required in specifying the CME\ninitial state. With the newly developed data-driven Eruptive Event Generator\nGibson-Low (EEGGL), we present a method to derive Gibson-Low (GL) flux rope\nparameters through a handful of observational quantities so that the modeled\nCMEs can propagate with the desired CME speeds near the Sun. A test result with\nCMEs launched with different Carrington rotation magnetograms are shown. Our\nstudy shows a promising result for using the first-principles-based MHD global\nmodel as a forecasting tool, which is capable of predicting the CME direction\nof propagation, arrival time, and ICME magnetic field at 1 AU (see companion\npaper by Jin et al. 2016b).\n", "  Cosmological $N$-body simulations predict dark matter (DM) haloes with steep\ncentral cusps (e.g. NFW, Navarro et al. 1996). This contradicts observations of\ngas kinematics in low-mass galaxies that imply the existence of shallow DM\ncores. Baryonic processes such as adiabatic contraction and gas outflows can,\nin principle, alter the initial DM density profile, yet their relative\ncontributions to the halo transformation remain uncertain. Recent high\nresolution, cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Di Cintio et al. 2014, DC14)\npredict that inner density profiles depend systematically on the ratio of\nstellar to DM mass (M$_*$/M$_{\\text{halo}}$). Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\napproach, we test the NFW and the M$_*$/M$_{\\text{halo}}$-dependent DC14 halo\nmodels against a sample of 147 galaxy rotation curves from the new {\\it\nSpitzer} Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data set. These\ngalaxies all have extended H{\\small I} rotation curves from radio\ninterferometry as well as accurate stellar mass density profiles from\nnear-infrared photometry. The DC14 halo profile provides markedly better fits\nto the data compared to the NFW profile. Unlike NFW, the DC14 halo parameters\nfound in our rotation curve fits naturally fall within two standard deviations\nof the mass-concentration relation predicted by $\\Lambda$CDM and the stellar\nmass-halo mass relation inferred from abundance matching with few outliers.\nHalo profiles modified by baryonic processes are therefore more consistent with\nexpectations from $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology and\nprovide better fits to galaxy rotation curves across a wide range of galaxy\nproperties than do halo models that neglect baryonic physics. Our results offer\na solution to the decade long cusp-core discrepancy.\n", "  We report new constraints on flavor-changing non-standard neutrino\ninteractions from the MINOS long-baseline experiment using $\\nu_{e}$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$ appearance candidate events from predominantly $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ beams. We used a statistical selection algorithm to separate\n$\\nu_{e}$ candidates from background events, enabling an analysis of the\ncombined MINOS neutrino and antineutrino data. We observe no deviations from\nstandard neutrino mixing, and thus place constraints on the non-standard\ninteraction matter effect, $|\\varepsilon_{e\\tau}|$, and phase,\n$(\\delta_{CP}+\\delta_{e\\tau})$, using a thirty-bin likelihood fit.\n", "  We study the quantum relaxation of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising\nmodel after global quenches with a real-time variational Monte Carlo method and\naddress the question whether this non-integrable, two-dimensional system\nthermalizes or not. We consider both interaction quenches in the paramagnetic\nphase and field quenches in the ferromagnetic phase and compare the\ntime-averaged probability distributions of non-conserved quantities like\nmagnetization and correlation functions to the thermal distributions according\nto the canonical Gibbs ensemble obtained with quantum Monte Carlo simulations\nat temperatures defined by the excess energy in the system. We find that the\noccurrence of thermalization crucially depends on the quench parameters: While\nafter the interaction quenches in the paramagnetic phase thermalization can be\nobserved, our results for the field quenches in the ferromagnetic phase show\nclear deviations from the thermal system. These deviations increase with the\nquench strength and become especially clear comparing the shape of the thermal\nand the time-averaged distributions, the latter ones indicating that the system\ndoes not completely lose the memory of its initial state even for strong\nquenches. We discuss our results with respect to a recently formulated theorem\non generalized thermalization in quantum systems.\n", "  We present a survey on exoplanetary systems of binary stars with stellar\nseparations less than 100 au. For a sample of 11 binaries that harbour detected\ncircumstellar giant planets we investigate the frequency of systems with\nsecular resonances (SR) affecting the habitable zone (HZ). Secular resonances\nare connected to dynamically unstable or chaotic regions by enforcing highly\neccentric motion. We apply a semi-analytical method to determine the locations\nof linear SR, which is based on finding the apsidal precession frequencies of\nthe massive bodies. For configurations where the giant planet is located\nexterior to the HZ we find that there is always a SR interior to its orbit, the\nexact location of the SR strongly depends on the system's architecture. In\nsystems with the giant planet interior to the HZ no SR can occur in the\nNewtonian framework. Taking into account the general relativistic precession of\nthe perihelion, which increases the precession frequencies, planets with $a <\n0.1$ au can cause SR in the HZ. We find two cases where the SR is located\ninside the HZ, and some more where it is close to the HZ. Generally, giant\nplanets interior to the HZ are more favourable than exterior planets to avoid\nSR in the HZ. Around the location of the SR weaker mean-motion resonances are\nexcited, and resonance overlap is possible. Existing analytical models are not\nas accurate as the semi-analytical method in locating the SR and deviate by\n$\\sim 0.1$ au or more.\n", "  We analyze the electron dynamics in corrugated layers of transition-metal\ndichalcogenides. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling, the intrinsic\n(Gaussian) curvature leads to an emergent gauge field associated with the Berry\nconnection of the spinor wave function. We discuss the gauge field created by\ntopological defects of the lattice, namely, tetragonal/octogonal disclinations\nand edge dislocations. Ripples and topological disorder induce the same\ndephasing effects as a random magnetic field, suppressing the weak localization\neffects. This geometric magnetic field can be detected in a Aharonov-Bohm\ninterferometry experiment by measuring the local density of states in the\nvicinity of corrugations.\n", "  We introduce an effective theory with manifest particle-vortex symmetry for\ndisordered thin films undergoing a magnetic field-tuned\nsuperconductor-insulator transition. The theory may enable one to access both\nthe critical properties of the strong-disorder limit, which has recently been\nconfirmed by Breznay et al. [PNAS 113, 280 (2016)] to exhibit particle-vortex\nsymmetric electrical response, and the nearby metallic phase discovered earlier\nby Mason and Kapitulnik [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 5341 (1999)] in less disordered\nsamples. Within the effective theory, the Cooper-pair and field-induced vortex\ndegrees of freedom are simultaneously incorporated into an electrically-neutral\nDirac fermion minimally coupled to an (emergent) Chern-Simons gauge field. A\nderivation of the theory follows upon mapping the superconductor-insulator\ntransition to the integer quantum Hall plateau transition and the subsequent\nuse of Son's particle-hole symmetric composite Fermi liquid. Remarkably,\nparticle-vortex symmetric response does not require the introduction of\ndisorder; rather, it results when the Dirac fermions exhibit vanishing Hall\neffect. The theory predicts approximately equal (diagonal) thermopower and\nNernst signal with a deviation parameterized by the measured electrical Hall\nresponse at the symmetric point.\n", "  Sampling the distribution of bosons that have undergone a random unitary\nevolution is strongly believed to be a computationally hard problem. Key to\noutperforming classical simulations of this task is to increase both the number\nof input photons and the size of the network. We propose driven boson sampling,\nin which photons are input within the network itself, as a means to approach\nthis goal. When using heralded single-photon sources based on parametric\ndown-conversion, this approach offers an $\\sim e$-fold enhancement in the input\nstate generation rate over scattershot boson sampling, reaching the scaling\nlimit for such sources. More significantly, this approach offers a dramatic\nincrease in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to higher-order photon\ngeneration from such probabilistic sources, which removes the need for photon\nnumber resolution during the heralding process as the size of the system\nincreases.\n", "  A usual assumption in quantum estimation is that the unknown parameter labels\nthe possible states of the system, while it influences neither the sample space\nof outcomes nor the measurement aimed at extracting information on the\nparameter itself. This assumption is crucial to prove the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao\ntheorem and to introduce the quantum Fisher information as an upper bound to\nthe Fisher information of any possible measurement. However, there are relevant\nestimation problems where this assumption does not hold and an alternative\napproach should be developed to find the genuine ultimate bound to precision of\nquantum measurements. We investigate physical situations where there is an\nintrinsic dependence of the measurement strategy on the parameter and find that\nquantum-enhanced measurements may be more precise than previously thought.\n", "  We introduce an intrinsic Ly\\alpha\\ emission line profile reconstruction\nmethod for high-$z$ quasars (QSOs). This approach utilises a covariance matrix\nof emission line properties obtained from a large, moderate-$z$ ($2 \\leq z \\leq\n2.5$), high signal to noise (S/N > 15) sample of BOSS QSOs. For each QSO, we\ncomplete a Monte Carlo Markov Chain fitting of the continuum and emission line\nproperties and perform a visual quality assessment to construct a large\ndatabase of robustly fit spectra. With this dataset, we construct a covariance\nmatrix to describe the correlations between the high ionisation emission lines\nLy\\alpha, C IV, Si IV + O IV] and C III], and find it to be well approximated\nby an $N$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. This covariance matrix\ncharacterises the correlations between the line width, peak height and velocity\noffset from systemic while also allowing for the existence of broad and narrow\nline components for Ly\\alpha\\ and C IV. We illustrate how this covariance\nmatrix allows us to statistically characterise the intrinsic Ly\\alpha\\ line\nsolely from the observed spectrum redward of 1275\\AA. This procedure can be\nused to reconstruct the intrinsic Ly\\alpha\\ line emission profile in cases\nwhere Ly\\alpha\\ may otherwise be obscured. Applying this reconstruction method\nto our sample of QSOs, we recovered the Ly\\alpha\\ line flux to within 15 per\ncent of the measured flux at 1205\\AA\\ (1220\\AA) ~85 (90) per cent of the time.\n", "  We have studied a generalized three band crossing model in 2D, the\ngeneralized $\\alpha - T_3$ lattice, ranging from the pseudospin-1 Dirac\nequation through a quadratic+flat band touching to the pseudospin-1/2 Dirac\nequation. A general method is presented to determine the operator form of the\nGreen's function, being gauge and representation independent. This yields the\nLandau level structure in a quantizing magnetic field and the longitudinal and\ntransversal magneto-optical conductivities of the underlying system Although\nthe magneto-optical selection rules allow for many transitions between Landau\nlevels, the dominant one stems from exciting a particle from/to the flat band\nto/from a propagating band. The Hall conductivity from each valley is rational\n(not quantized at all), in agreement with Berry phase considerations, though\ntheir sum is always integer quantized.\n", "  We present the results of the first, deep ALMA imaging covering the full 4.5\nsq arcmin of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) as previously imaged with\nWFC3/IR on HST. Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous\n1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a\nresolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ~50 >3.5sigma peaks, a\nrigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) > 120 microJy.\nAll of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts (<z> =\n2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging. Due to the\nwealth of supporting data in this unique field, the physical properties of the\nALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and\nUV+FIR star-formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the\nbest predictor of SFR in the high-z Universe; indeed at z > 2 our ALMA sample\ncontains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the HUDF with M* > 2 x 10^10 Msun and we detect\nonly one galaxy at z > 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies\nwith increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to\nprobe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S(1.3) ~\n10 micro-Jy. We find strong evidence for a steep `main sequence' for\nstar-forming galaxies at z ~ 2, with SFR \\propto M* and a mean specific SFR =\n2.2 /Gyr. Moreover, we find that ~85% of total star formation at z ~ 2 is\nenshrouded in dust, with ~65% of all star formation at this epoch occurring in\nhigh-mass galaxies (M* > 2 x 10^10 Msun), for which the average\nobscured:unobscured SF ratio is ~200. Finally, we combine our new ALMA results\nwith the existing HST data to revisit the cosmic evolution of star-formation\nrate density; we find that this peaks at z ~ 2.5, and that the star-forming\nUniverse transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured thereafter at\nz ~ 4.\n", "  We present a quasiparticle interference study of clean and Mn surface-doped\nTaAs, a prototypical Weyl semimetal, to test the screening properties as well\nas the stability of Fermi arcs against Coulomb and magnetic scattering.\nContrary to topological insulators, the impurities are effectively screened in\nWeyl semimetals. The adatoms significantly enhance the strength of the signal\nsuch that theoretical predictions on the potential impact of Fermi arcs can be\nunambiguously scrutinized. Our analysis reveals the existence of three\nextremely short, previously unknown scattering vectors. Comparison with theory\ntraces them back to scattering events between large parallel segments of\nspin-split trivial states, strongly limiting their coherence. In sharp contrast\nto previous work [R. Batabyal et al., Sci. Adv. 2, e1600709 (2016)], where\nsimilar but weaker subtle modulations were interpreted as evidence of\nquasiparticle interference originating from Femi arcs, we can safely exclude\nthis being the case. Overall, our results indicate that intra- as well as\ninter-Fermi arc scattering are strongly suppressed and may explain why-in spite\nof their complex multiband structure-transport measurements show signatures of\ntopological states in Weyl monopnictides.\n", "  DDOTI will be a wide-field robotic imager consisting of six 28-cm telescopes\nwith prime focus CCDs mounted on a common equatorial mount. Each telescope will\nhave a field of view of 12 square degrees, will have 2 arcsec pixels, and will\nreach a 10-sigma limiting magnitude in 60 seconds of r = 18.7 in dark time and\nr = 18.0 in bright time. The set of six will provide an instantaneous field of\nview of about 72 square degrees. DDOTI uses commercial components almost\nentirely. The first DDOTI will be installed at the Observatorio Astron\\'omico\nNacional in Sierra San Pedro Mart\\'ir, Baja California, M\\'exico in early 2017.\nThe main science goals of DDOTI are the localization of the optical transients\nassociated with GRBs detected by the GBM instrument on the Fermi satellite and\nwith gravitational-wave transients. DDOTI will also be used for studies of AGN\nand YSO variability and to determine the occurrence of hot Jupiters. The\nprincipal advantage of DDOTI compared to other similar projects is cost: a\nsingle DDOTI installation costs only about US$500,000. This makes it possible\nto contemplate a global network of DDOTI installations. Such geographic\ndiversity would give earlier access and a higher localization rate. We are\nactively exploring this option.\n", "  Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KID) are now routinely used in ground-based\ntelescopes. Large arrays, deployed in formats up to kilopixels, exhibit\nstate-of-the-art performance at millimeter (e.g. 120-300 GHz, NIKA and NIKA2 on\nthe IRAM 30-meters) and sub-millimeter (e.g. 350-850 GHz AMKID on APEX)\nwavelengths. In view of future utilizations above the atmosphere, we have\nstudied in detail the interaction of ionizing particles with LEKID (Lumped\nElement KID) arrays. We have constructed a dedicated cryogenic setup that\nallows to reproduce the typical observing conditions of a space-borne\nobservatory. We will report the details and conclusions from a number of\nmeasurements. We give a brief description of our short term project, consisting\nin flying LEKID on a stratospheric balloon named B-SIDE.\n", "  We present a calculation of the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum, fully\nincluding all gravitational effects and a possible non-minimal Higgs-curvature\ncoupling $\\xi$, and using the three-loop Standard Model effective potential.\nWithout a non-minimal coupling, we find that the effect of the gravitational\nbackreaction is small and less significant than previous calculations\nsuggested. The gravitational effects are smallest, and almost completely\nsuppressed, near the conformal value $\\xi=1/6$ of the non-minimal coupling.\nMoving $\\xi$ away from this value in either direction universally suppresses\nthe decay rate.\n", "  Despite its fundamental importance, a reliable estimate of the Galactic nova\nrate has remained elusive. Here, the overall Galactic nova rate is estimated by\nextrapolating the observed rate for novae reaching $m\\leq2$ to include the\nentire Galaxy using a two component disk plus bulge model for the distribution\nof stars in the Milky Way. The present analysis improves on previous work by\nconsidering important corrections for incompleteness in the observed rate of\nbright novae and by employing a Monte Carlo analysis to better estimate the\nuncertainty in the derived nova rates. Several models are considered to account\nfor differences in the assumed properties of bulge and disk nova populations\nand in the absolute magnitude distribution. The simplest models, which assume\nuniform properties between bulge and disk novae, predict Galactic nova rates of\n$\\sim$50 to in excess of 100 per year, depending on the assumed incompleteness\nat bright magnitudes. Models where the disk novae are assumed to be more\nluminous than bulge novae are explored, and predict nova rates up to 30% lower,\nin the range of $\\sim$35 to $\\sim$75 per year. An average of the most plausible\nmodels yields a rate of $50_{-23}^{+31}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is arguably the best\nestimate currently available for the nova rate in the Galaxy. Virtually all\nmodels produce rates that represent significant increases over recent\nestimates, and bring the Galactic nova rate into better agreement with that\nexpected based on comparison with the latest results from extragalactic\nsurveys.\n", "  We consider a general class of asymptotically locally AdS_5 solutions of\nminimal gauged supergravity, that are dual to superconformal field theories on\ncurved backgrounds S^1 x M_3 preserving two supercharges. We demonstrate that\nstandard holographic renormalization corresponds to a scheme that breaks\nsupersymmetry. We propose new boundary terms that restore supersymmetry, and\nshow that for smooth solutions with topology S^1 x R^4 the improved on-shell\naction reproduces both the supersymmetric Casimir energy and the field theory\nBPS relation between charges.\n", "  Ising spin glass models with bimodal, Gaussian, uniform and Laplacian\ninteraction distributions in dimension five are studied through detailed\nnumerical simulations. The data are analyzed in both the finite-size scaling\nregime and the thermodynamic limit regime. It is shown that the values of\ncritical exponents and of dimensionless observables at criticality are model\ndependent. Models in a single universality class have identical values for each\nof these critical parameters, so Ising spin glass models in dimension five with\ndifferent interaction distributions each lie in different universality classes.\nThis result confirms conclusions drawn from measurements in dimension four and\ndimension two.\n", "  Selected universal experimental properties of high temperature\nsuperconducting (HTS) cuprates have been singled out in the last decade. One of\nthe pivotal challenges in this field is the designation of a consistent\ninterpretation framework within which we can describe quantitatively the\nuniversal features of those systems. Here we analyze in a detailed manner the\nprincipal experimental data and compare them quantitatively with the approach\nbased on a single band of strongly correlated electrons supplemented with\nstrong antiferromagnetic (super)exchange interaction (the so-called $t$-$J$-$U$\nmodel). The model rationale is provided by estimating its macroscopic\nparameters on the basis of the 3-band approach for the Cu-O plane. We use our\noriginal full Gutzwiller-wave-function solution by going beyond the\nrenormalized mean field theory (RMFT) in a systematic manner. Our approach\nreproduces very well the observed hole doping ($\\delta$) dependence of the\nkinetic-energy gain in the superconducting phase, one of the principal\nnon-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer features of the cuprates. The calculated Fermi\nvelocity in the nodal direction is practically $\\delta$-independent and its\nuniversal value agrees very well with that determined experimentally. Also, a\nweak doping dependence of the Fermi wave-vector leads to an almost constant\nvalue of the effective mass in a pure superconducting phase which is both\nobserved in the experiment and reproduced within our approach. An assessment of\nthe currently used models is carried out and the results of the canonical RMFT\nas a zeroth-order solution are provided for comparison to illustrate the\nnecessity of introduced higher order contributions.\n", "  Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPM) are regarded as novel photo-detectors to\nreplace conventional Photo-Multiplier Tubes (PMTs). However, the breakdown\nvoltage dependence on the ambient temperature results in a gain variation of\n$\\sim$3$\\% /^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$. This severely limits the application of this\ndevice in experiments with wide range of operating temperature, especially in\nspace missions. An experimental setup was established to investigate the\ntemperature and bias voltage dependence of gain for the Multi-Pixel Photon\nCounter (MPPC). The gain and breakdown voltage dependence on operating\ntemperature of an MPPC can be approximated by a linear function, which is\nsimilar to the behavior of a zener diode. The measured temperature coefficient\nof the breakdown voltage is $(59.4 \\pm 0.4$ mV)$/^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$. According\nto this fact, an analog power supply based on two zener diodes and an\noperational amplifier was designed with a positive temperature coefficient. The\nmeasured temperature dependence for the designed power supply is between 63.65\nto 64.61~mV/$^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$ at different output voltages. The designed\npower supply can bias the MPPC at an over-voltage with a temperature variation\nof $\\sim$ 5~mV$/^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$. The gain variation of the MPPC biased at\nover-voltage of 2~V was reduced from 2.8$\\% /^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$ to 0.3$\\%\n/^{\\circ} \\mathrm C$ when biased the MPPC with the designed power supply for\ngain control. Detailed design and performance of the analog power supply in the\ntemperature range from -42.7$^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to 20.9$^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\nwill be discussed in this paper.\n", "  Low-dimensional multiferroic materials hold great promises in miniaturized\ndevice applications such as nanoscale transducers, actuators, sensors,\nphotovoltaics, and nonvolatile memories. Here, using first-principles theory we\npredict that two-dimensional (2D) monolayer Group IV monochalcogenides\nincluding GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe are a class of 2D semiconducting\nmultiferroics with strongly coupled giant in-plane spontaneous ferroelectric\npolarization and spontaneous ferroelastic lattice strain that are\nthermodynamically stable at room temperature and beyond, and can be effectively\nmodulated by elastic strain engineering. Their optical absorption spectra\nexhibit strong in-plane anisotropy with visible-spectrum excitonic gaps and\nsizable exciton binding energies, rendering the unique characteristics of\nlow-dimensional semiconductors. More importantly, the predicted low domain wall\nenergy and small migration barrier together with the coupled multiferroic order\nand anisotropic electronic structures suggest their great potentials for\ntunable multiferroic functional devices by manipulating external electrical,\nmechanical, and optical field to control the internal responses, and enable the\ndevelopment of four device concepts including 2D ferroelectric memory, 2D\nferroelastic memory, and 2D ferroelastoelectric nonvolatile photonic memory as\nwell as 2D ferroelectric excitonic photovoltaics.\n", "  We use the cosmo-OWLS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to\ninvestigate the scatter and evolution of the global hot gas properties of large\nsimulated populations of galaxy groups and clusters. Our aim is to compare the\npredictions of different physical models and to explore the extent to which\ncommonly-adopted assumptions in observational analyses (e.g. self-similar\nevolution) are violated. We examine the relations between (true) halo mass and\nthe X-ray temperature, X-ray luminosity, gas mass, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\nflux, the X-ray analogue of the SZ flux ($Y_X$) and the hydrostatic mass. For\nthe most realistic models, which include AGN feedback, the slopes of the\nvarious mass-observable relations deviate substantially from the self-similar\nones, particularly at late times and for low-mass clusters. The amplitude of\nthe mass-temperature relation shows negative evolution with respect to the\nself-similar prediction (i.e. slower than the prediction) for all models,\ndriven by an increase in non-thermal pressure support at higher redshifts. The\nAGN models predict strong positive evolution of the gas mass fractions at low\nhalo masses. The SZ flux and $Y_X$ show positive evolution with respect to\nself-similarity at low mass but negative evolution at high mass. The scatter\nabout the relations is well approximated by log-normal distributions, with\nwidths that depend mildly on halo mass. The scatter decreases significantly\nwith increasing redshift. The exception is the hydrostatic mass-halo mass\nrelation, for which the scatter increases with redshift. Finally, we discuss\nthe relative merits of various hot gas-based mass proxies.\n", "  We present the open-source radiative transfer code named HELIOS, which is\nconstructed for studying exoplanetary atmospheres. In its initial version, the\nmodel atmospheres of HELIOS are one-dimensional and plane-parallel, and the\nequation of radiative transfer is solved in the two-stream approximation with\nnon-isotropic scattering. A small set of the main infrared absorbers is\nemployed, computed with the opacity calculator HELIOS-K and combined using a\ncorrelated-$k$ approximation. The molecular abundances originate from validated\nanalytical formulae for equilibrium chemistry. We compare HELIOS with the work\nof Miller-Ricci & Fortney using a model of GJ 1214b, and perform several tests,\nwhere we find: model atmospheres with single-temperature layers struggle to\nconverge to radiative equilibrium; $k$-distribution tables constructed with\n$\\gtrsim 0.01$ cm$^{-1}$ resolution in the opacity function ($ \\lesssim 10^3$\npoints per wavenumber bin) may result in errors $\\gtrsim 1$-10 % in the\nsynthetic spectra; and a diffusivity factor of 2 approximates well the exact\nradiative transfer solution in the limit of pure absorption. We construct\n\"null-hypothesis\" models (chemical equilibrium, radiative equilibrium and solar\nelement abundances) for 6 hot Jupiters. We find that the dayside emission\nspectra of HD 189733b and WASP-43b are consistent with the null hypothesis,\nwhile it consistently under-predicts the observed fluxes of WASP-8b, WASP-12b,\nWASP-14b and WASP-33b. We demonstrate that our results are somewhat insensitive\nto the choice of stellar models (blackbody, Kurucz or PHOENIX) and metallicity,\nbut are strongly affected by higher carbon-to-oxygen ratios. The code is\npublicly available as part of the Exoclimes Simulation Platform (ESP;\nexoclime.net).\n", "  The extension of the Standard Model by right handed neutrinos with masses in\nthe GeV range can simultaneously explain the observed neutrino masses via the\nseesaw mechanism and the baryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis. It\nhas previously been claimed that the requirement for successful baryogenesis\nimplies that the rate of neutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay in this scenario is\nalways smaller than the standard prediction from light neutrino exchange alone.\nIn contrast, we find that the rate for this process can also be enhanced due to\na dominant contribution from heavy neutrino exchange. In a small part of the\nparameter space it even exceeds the current experimental limit, while the\nproperties of the heavy neutrinos are consistent with all other experimental\nconstraints and the observed baryon asymmetry is reproduced. This implies that\nneutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay experiments have already started to rule out\npart of the leptogenesis parameter space that is not constrained by any other\nexperiment, and the lepton number violation that is responsible for the origin\nof baryonic matter in the universe may be observed in the near future.\n", "  The microscopic description of heavy-ion reactions at low beam energies is\nachieved within hadronic transport approaches. In this article a new approach\nSMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is introduced\nand applied to study the production of non-strange particles in heavy-ion\nreactions at $E_{\\rm kin}=0.4-2A$ GeV. First, the model is described including\ndetails about the collision criterion, the initial conditions and the resonance\nformation and decays. To validate the approach, equilibrium properties such as\ndetailed balance are presented and the results are compared to experimental\ndata for elementary cross sections. Finally results for pion and proton\nproduction in C+C and Au+Au collisions is confronted with HADES and FOPI data.\nPredictions for particle production in $\\pi+A$ collisions are made.\n", "  We explore how thermal fluctuations affect the mechanics of thin amorphous\nspherical shells. In flat membranes with a shear modulus, thermal fluctuations\nincrease the bending rigidity and reduce the in-plane elastic moduli in a\nscale-dependent fashion. This is still true for spherical shells. However, the\nadditional coupling between the shell curvature, the local in-plane stretching\nmodes and the local out-of-plane undulations, leads to novel phenomena. In\nspherical shells thermal fluctuations produce a radius-dependent negative\neffective surface tension, equivalent to applying an inward external pressure.\nBy adapting renormalization group calculations to allow for a spherical\nbackground curvature, we show that while small spherical shells are stable,\nsufficiently large shells are crushed by this thermally generated \"pressure\".\nSuch shells can be stabilized by an outward osmotic pressure, but the effective\nshell size grows non-linearly with increasing outward pressure, with the same\nuniversal power law exponent that characterizes the response of fluctuating\nflat membranes to a uniform tension.\n", "  It has been broadly acknowledged that vortex detection algorithms, usually\nbased on linear-algebraic properties of the velocity gradient tensor, can be\nplagued with severe shortcomings and may become, in practical terms, dependent\non the choice of subjective threshold parameters in their implementations. In\ntwo-dimensions, a large class of standard vortex identification prescriptions\nturn out to be equivalent to the \"swirling strength criterion\"\n($\\lambda_{ci}$-criterion), which is critically revisited in this work. We\nclassify the instances where the accuracy of the $\\lambda_{ci}$-criterion is\naffected by nonlinear superposition effects and propose an alternative vortex\ndetection scheme based on the local curvature properties of the vorticity graph\n$(x,y,\\omega)$ -- the \"vorticity curvature criterion\"\n($\\lambda_\\omega$-criterion) -- which improves over the results obtained with\nthe $\\lambda_{ci}$-criterion in controlled Monte-Carlo tests. We show that the\n$\\lambda_\\omega$-criterion is able to cope with strong shear effects, if a\nsubtraction of the mean velocity field background is performed, in the spirit\nof the Reynolds decomposition procedure. A realistic comparative study for\nvortex identification is then carried out for a direct numerical simulation\n(DNS) of a turbulent channel flow, including a three-dimensional extension of\nthe $\\lambda_\\omega$-criterion. In contrast to the $\\lambda_{ci}$-criterion,\nthe $\\lambda_\\omega$-criterion indicates in a consistent way the existence of\nsmall scale isotropic turbulent fluctuations in the logarithmic layer, in\nconsonance with long-standing assumptions commonly taken in turbulent boundary\nlayer phenomenology.\n", "  We determine, based on the latest experimental Deep Virtual Compton\nScattering experimental data, the dependence of the spatial size of the proton\non the quark's longitudinal momentum. This results in a three-dimensional\nmomentum-space image and tomography of the proton.\n", "  We present a theoretical method for solving the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies, by assuming an instantaneous recycling approximation for chemical\nelements restored by massive stars and the Delay Time Distribution formalism\nfor the delayed chemical enrichment by Type Ia Supernovae. The galaxy gas mass\nassembly history, together with the assumed stellar yields and initial mass\nfunction, represent the starting point of this method. We derive a simple and\ngeneral equation which closely relates the Laplace transforms of the galaxy gas\naccretion history and star formation history, which can be used to simplify the\nproblem of retrieving these quantities in the galaxy evolution models assuming\na linear Schmidt-Kennicutt law. We find that - once the galaxy star formation\nhistory has been reconstructed from our assumptions - the differential equation\nfor the evolution of the chemical element $X$ can be suitably solved with\nclassical methods. We apply our model to reproduce the [O/Fe] and [Si/Fe] vs.\n[Fe/H] chemical abundance patterns as observed at the solar neighborhood, by\nassuming a decaying exponential infall rate of gas and different delay time\ndistributions for Type Ia Supernovae; we also explore the effect of assuming a\nnonlinear Schmidt-Kennicutt law, with the index of the power law being $k=1.4$.\nAlthough approximate, we conclude that our model with the single degenerate\nscenario for Type Ia Supernovae provides the best agreement with the observed\nset of data. Our method can be used by other complementary galaxy stellar\npopulation synthesis models to predict also the chemical evolution of galaxies.\n", "  The dielectric function is one of the most important quantities that\ndescribes the electrical and optical properties of solids. Accurate modeling of\nthe frequency-dependent dielectric function has great significance in the study\nof the long-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction for solids and adsorption. In\nthis work, we calculate the frequency-dependent dielectric functions of\nsemiconductors and insulators using the $GW$ method with and without exciton\neffects, as well as efficient semilocal density functional theory (DFT), and\ncompare these calculations with a model frequency-dependent dielectric\nfunction. We find that for semiconductors with moderate band gaps, the model\ndielectric functions, $GW$ values, and DFT calculations all agree well with\neach other. However, for insulators with strong exciton effects, the model\ndielectric functions have a better agreement with accurate $GW$ values than the\nDFT calculations, particularly in high-frequency region. To understand this, we\nrepeat the DFT calculations with scissors correction, by shifting DFT Kohn-Sham\nenergy gap to match the experimental band gap. We find that scissors correction\nonly moderately improves the DFT dielectric function in low-frequency region.\nBased on the dielectric functions calculated with different methods, we make a\ncomparative study by applying these dielectric functions to calculate the vdW\ncoefficients ($C_3$ and $C_5$) for adsorption of rare-gas atoms on a variety of\nsurfaces. We find that the vdW coefficients obtained with the nearly-free\nelectron gas-based model dielectric function agree quite well with those\nobtained from the $GW$ dielectric function, in particular for adsorption on\nsemiconductors, leading to an overall error of less than 7% for $C_3$ and 5%\nfor $C_5$. This demonstrates the reliability of the model dielectric function\nfor the study of physisorption.\n", "  Using a simple numerical model of skyrmions in a two-dimensional system\ninteracting with a quasi-one dimensional periodic substrate under combined dc\nand ac drives where the dc drive is applied perpendicular to the substrate\nperiodicity, we show that a rich variety of novel phase locking dynamics can\noccur due to the influence of the Magnus term on the skyrmion dynamics. Instead\nof Shapiro steps, the velocity response in the direction of the dc drive\nexhibits a series of spikes, including extended dc drive intervals over which\nthe skyrmions move in the direction opposite to the dc drive, producing\nnegative mobility. There are also specific dc drive values at which the\nskyrmions move exactly perpendicular to the dc drive direction, giving a\ncondition of absolute transverse mobility.\n", "  We describe 280 GHz bolometric detector arrays that instrument the\nballoon-borne polarimeter SPIDER. A primary science goal of SPIDER is to\nmeasure the large-scale B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background\nin search of the cosmic-inflation, gravitational-wave signature. 280 GHz\nchannels aid this science goal by constraining the level of B-mode\ncontamination from galactic dust emission. We present the focal plane unit\ndesign, which consists of a 16$\\times$16 array of conical, corrugated feedhorns\ncoupled to a monolithic detector array fabricated on a 150 mm diameter silicon\nwafer. Detector arrays are capable of polarimetric sensing via waveguide\nprobe-coupling to a multiplexed array of transition-edge-sensor (TES)\nbolometers. The SPIDER receiver has three focal plane units at 280 GHz, which\nin total contains 765 spatial pixels and 1,530 polarization sensitive\nbolometers. By fabrication and measurement of single feedhorns, we demonstrate\n14.7$^{\\circ}$ FHWM Gaussian-shaped beams with $<$1% ellipticity in a 30%\nfractional bandwidth centered at 280 GHz. We present electromagnetic\nsimulations of the detection circuit, which show 94% band-averaged,\nsingle-polarization coupling efficiency, 3% reflection and 3% radiative loss.\nLastly, we demonstrate a low thermal conductance bolometer, which is\nwell-described by a simple TES model and exhibits an electrical noise\nequivalent power (NEP) = 2.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$ W/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nconsistent with the phonon noise prediction.\n", "  We evaluate the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum using\nperturbation theory up to dominant terms at 1-loop order and compare it to\nnumerical simulations. We decompose the covariance matrix into the disconnected\n(Gaussian) part, trispectrum from the modes outside the survey (beat coupling\nor super-sample variance), and trispectrum from the modes inside the survey,\nand show how the different components contribute to the overall covariance\nmatrix. We find the agreement with the simulations is at a 10\\% level up to $k\n\\sim 1 h {\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. We show that all the connected components are\ndominated by the large-scale modes ($k<0.1 h {\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$), regardless of\nthe value of the wavevectors $k,\\, k'$ of the covariance matrix, suggesting\nthat one must be careful in applying the jackknife or bootstrap methods to the\ncovariance matrix. We perform an eigenmode decomposition of the connected part\nof the covariance matrix, showing that at higher $k$ it is dominated by a\nsingle eigenmode. The full covariance matrix can be approximated as the\ndisconnected part only, with the connected part being treated as an external\nnuisance parameter with a known scale dependence, and a known prior on its\nvariance for a given survey volume. Finally, we provide a prescription for how\nto evaluate the covariance matrix from small box simulations without the need\nto simulate large volumes.\n", "  We investigate the possible rescattering effects which may contribute to the\nprocess $B^+\\to J/\\psi\\phi K^+$. It is shown that the $D_{s}^{*+}D_{s}^-$\nrescattering via the open-charmed meson loops, and $\\psi^\\prime \\phi$\nrescattering via the $\\psi^\\prime K_1$ loops may simulate the structures of\n$X(4140)$ and $X(4700)$, respectively. However, if the quantum numbers of\n$X(4274)$ ($X(4500)$) are $1^{++}$ ($0^{++}$), it is hard to to ascribe the\nobservation of $X(4274)$ and $X(4500)$ to the $P$-wave threshold rescattering\neffects, which implies that $X(4274)$ and $X(4500)$ could be genuine\nresonances. We also suggest that $X(4274)$ may be the conventional orbitally\nexcited state $\\chi_{c1}(3P)$.\n", "  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies is the\ncombination of the IMF of the stellar population formed in-situ and that of\naccreted stellar populations. Using as an observable the effective IMF\n$\\alpha_{IMF}$, defined as the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy\nand the stellar mass inferred assuming a Salpeter IMF, we present a theoretical\nmodel for its evolution as a result of dry mergers. We use a simple dry merger\nevolution model, based on cosmological $N$-body simulations, together with\nempirically motivated prescriptions for the IMF to make predictions for how the\neffective IMF of massive early-type galaxies changes from $z=2$ to $z=0$. We\nfind that the IMF normalization of individual galaxies becomes lighter with\ntime. At fixed velocity dispersion, $\\alpha_{IMF}$ is predicted to be constant\nwith redshift. Current constraints on the evolution of the IMF are in slight\ntension with this prediction, even though systematic uncertainties prevent a\nconclusive statement. The correlation of $\\alpha_{IMF}$ with stellar mass\nbecomes shallower with time, while the correlation between $\\alpha_{IMF}$ and\nvelocity dispersion is mostly preserved by dry mergers. We also find that dry\nmergers can mix the dependence of the IMF on stellar mass and velocity\ndispersion, making it challenging to infer, from $z=0$ observations of global\ngalactic properties, what is the quantity that is originally coupled with the\nIMF.\n", "  We present average performance results for dynamical inference problems in\nlarge networks, where a set of nodes is hidden while the time trajectories of\nthe others are observed. Examples of this scenario can occur in signal\ntransduction and gene regulation networks. We focus on the linear stochastic\ndynamics of continuous variables interacting via random Gaussian couplings of\ngeneric symmetry. We analyze the inference error, given by the variance of the\nposterior distribution over hidden paths, in the thermodynamic limit and as a\nfunction of the system parameters and the ratio {\\alpha} between the number of\nhidden and observed nodes. By applying Kalman filter recursions we find that\nthe posterior dynamics is governed by an \"effective\" drift that incorporates\nthe effect of the observations. We present two approaches for characterizing\nthe posterior variance that allow us to tackle, respectively, equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium dynamics. The first appeals to Random Matrix Theory and reveals\naverage spectral properties of the inference error and typical posterior\nrelaxation times, the second is based on dynamical functionals and yields the\ninference error as the solution of an algebraic equation.\n", "  Using a set of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations run with the Cholla\ncode, we investigate how mass and momentum couple to the multiphase components\nof galactic winds. The simulations model the interaction between a hot wind\ndriven by supernova explosions and a cooler, denser cloud of interstellar or\ncircumgalactic media. By resolving scales of $\\Delta x<0.1$ pc over $>100$ pc\ndistances our calculations capture how the cloud disruption leads to a\ndistribution of densities and temperatures in the resulting multiphase outflow,\nand quantify the mass and momentum associated with each phase. We find the\nmultiphase wind contains comparable mass and momenta in phases over a wide\nrange of densities and temperatures extending from the hot wind ($n \\approx\n10^{-2.5}$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \\approx 10^{6.5}$ K) to the coldest\ncomponents ($n \\approx 10^2$ $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \\approx 10^2$ K). We\nfurther find that the momentum distributes roughly in proportion to the mass in\neach phase, and the mass-loading of the hot phase by the destruction of cold,\ndense material is an efficient process. These results provide new insight into\nthe physical origin of observed multiphase galactic outflows, and inform galaxy\nformation models that include coarser treatments of galactic winds. Our results\nconfirm that cool gas observed in outflows at large distances from the galaxy\n($\\gtrsim1$kpc) likely does not originate through the entrainment of cold\nmaterial near the central starburst.\n", "  We study gap solitons which appear in the topological gap of 1D bosonic dimer\nchains within the mean-field approximation. We find that such solitons have a\nnon-trivial texture of the sublattice pseudospin. We reveal their chiral nature\nby demonstrating the anisotropy of their behavior in presence of a localized\nenergy potential.\n", "  The Atacama Cosmology Telescope Polarimeter (ACTPol) is a polarization\nsensitive upgrade to the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Located at an elevation\nof 5190 m, ACTPol measures the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature\nand polarization with arcminute-scale angular resolution. Calibration of the\ndetector angles is a critical step in producing maps of the CMB polarization.\nPolarization angle offsets in the detector calibration can cause leakage in\npolarization from E to B modes and induce a spurious signal in the EB and TB\ncross correlations, which eliminates our ability to measure potential\ncosmological sources of EB and TB signals, such as cosmic birefringence. We\npresent our optical modeling and measurements associated with calibrating the\ndetector angles in ACTPol.\n", "  Large sensor-based science infrastructures for radio astronomy like the SKA\nwill be among the most intensive data-driven projects in the world, facing very\nhigh demanding computation, storage, management, and above all power demands.\nThe geographically wide distribution of the SKA and and its associated\nprocessing requirements in the form of tailored High Performance Computing\n(HPC) facilities, require a Greener approach towards the Information and\nCommunications Technologies (ICT) adopted for the data processing to enable\noperational compliance to potentially strict power budgets. Addressing the\nreduction of electricity costs, improve system power monitoring and the\ngeneration and management of electricity at system level is paramount to avoid\nfuture inefficiencies and higher costs and enable fulfillments of Key Science\nCases. Here we outline major characteristics and innovation approaches to\naddress power efficiency and long-term power sustainability for radio astronomy\nprojects, focusing on Green ICT for science and Smart power monitoring and\ncontrol.\n", "  We extract cosmological information from the anisotropic power spectrum\nmeasurements from the recently completed Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS), extending the concept of clustering wedges to Fourier space.\nMaking use of new FFT-based estimators, we measure the power spectrum\nclustering wedges of the BOSS sample by filtering out the information of\nLegendre multipoles l > 4. Our modelling of these measurements is based on\nnovel approaches to describe non-linear evolution, bias, and redshift-space\ndistortions, which we test using synthetic catalogues based on large-volume\nN-body simulations. We are able to include smaller scales than in previous\nanalyses, resulting in tighter cosmological constraints. Using three\noverlapping redshift bins, we measure the angular diameter distance, the Hubble\nparameter, and the cosmic growth rate, and explore the cosmological\nimplications of our full shape clustering measurements in combination with CMB\nand SN Ia data. Assuming a {\\Lambda}CDM cosmology, we constrain the matter\ndensity to {\\Omega}_m = 0.311 -0.010 +0.009 and the Hubble parameter to H_0 =\n67.6 -0.6 +0.7 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, at a confidence level (CL) of 68 per cent. We\nalso allow for non-standard dark energy models and modifications of the growth\nrate, finding good agreement with the {\\Lambda}CDM paradigm. For example, we\nconstrain the equation-of-state parameter to w = -1.019 -0.039 +0.048. This\npaper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from\nBOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others\nin Alam et al. 2016 to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.\n", "  We report the results of the monitoring campaign of the transient X-ray\npulsar SMC X-2 performed with the Swift/XRT telescope over the period of 2015\nSeptember - 2016 January during the Type II outburst. During this event, the\nbolometric luminosity of the source ranged from $\\simeq10^{39}$ down to\nseveral$\\times10^{34}$ erg/s. Moreover, we discovered its dramatic drop by a\nfactor of more than 100 below the limiting value of $L_{\\rm\nlim}\\simeq4\\times10^{36}$ erg/s, which can be interpreted as a transition to\nthe propeller regime. These measurements make SMC X-2 the sixth pulsating X-ray\nsource where such a transition is observed and allow us to estimate the\nmagnetic field of the neutron star in the system $B\\simeq3\\times10^{12}$ G,\nwhich is in agreement with independent results of the spectral analysis.\n", "  We discuss the design considerations and initial measurements from arrays of\ndual-polarization, lumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs)\nnominally designed for cosmic microwave background (CMB) studies. The detectors\nare horn-coupled, and each array element contains two single-polarization\nLEKIDs, which are made from thin-film aluminum and optimized for a single\nspectral band centered on 150 GHz. We are developing two array architectures,\none based on 160 micron thick silicon wafers and the other based on\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers with a 30 micron thick device layer. The\n20-element test arrays (40 LEKIDs) are characterized with both a\nlinearly-polarized electronic millimeter wave source and a thermal source. We\npresent initial measurements including the noise spectra, noise-equivalent\ntemperature, and responsivity. We discuss future testing and further design\noptimizations to be implemented.\n", "  Extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) in topological semimetals is a recent\ndiscovery which attracts attention due to its robust appearance in a growing\nnumber of materials. To search for a relation between XMR and\nsuperconductivity, we study the effect of pressure on LaBi taking advantage of\nits simple structure and simple composition. By increasing pressure we observe\nthe disappearance of XMR followed by the appearance of superconductivity at\nP=3.5 GPa.The suppression of XMR is correlated with increasing zero-field\nresistance instead of decreasing in-field resistance. At higher pressures, P=11\nGPa, we find a structural transition from the face center cubic lattice to a\nprimitive tetragonal lattice in agreement with theoretical predictions. We\ndiscuss the relationship between extreme magnetoresistance, superconductivity,\nand structural transition in LaBi.\n", "  The effects of a nonminimally coupled curvature-matter model of gravity on a\nperturbed Minkowski metric are presented. The action functional of the model\ninvolves two functions $f^1(R)$ and $f^2(R)$ of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$.\nThis work expands upon previous results, extending the framework developed\nthere to compute corrections up to order $O(1/c^4)$ of the $00$ component of\nthe metric tensor. It is shown that additional contributions arise due to both\nthe non-linear form $f^1(R)$ and the nonminimal coupling $f^2(R)$, including\nexponential contributions that cannot be expressed as an expansion in powers of\n$1/r$. Some possible experimental implications are assessed with application to\nperihelion precession.\n", "  We consider the dispersion on the supernova distance-redshift relation due to\npeculiar velocities and gravitational lensing, and the sensitivity of these\neffects to the amplitude of the matter power spectrum. We use the MeMo lensing\nlikelihood developed by Quartin, Marra & Amendola (2014), which accounts for\nthe characteristic non-Gaussian distribution caused by lensing magnification\nwith measurements of the first four central moments of the distribution of\nmagnitudes. We build on the MeMo likelihood by including the effects of\npeculiar velocities directly into the model for the moments. In order to\nmeasure the moments from sparse numbers of supernovae, we take a new approach\nusing Kernel Density Estimation to estimate the underlying probability density\nfunction of the magnitude residuals. We also describe a bootstrap re-sampling\napproach to estimate the data covariance matrix. We then apply the method to\nthe Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) supernova catalogue. When we impose only\nthat the intrinsic dispersion in magnitudes is independent of redshift, we find\n$\\sigma_8=0.44^{+0.63}_{-0.44}$ at the one standard deviation level, although\nwe note that in tests on simulations, this model tends to overestimate the\nmagnitude of the intrinsic dispersion, and underestimate $\\sigma_8$. We note\nthat the degeneracy between intrinsic dispersion and the effects of $\\sigma_8$\nis more pronounced when lensing and velocity effects are considered\nsimultaneously, due to a cancellation of redshift dependence when both effects\nare included. Keeping the model of the intrinsic dispersion fixed as a Gaussian\ndistribution of width 0.14 mag, we find $\\sigma_8 = 1.07^{+0.50}_{-0.76}$.\n", "  Maintaining the stability of synchronization state is crucial for the\nfunctioning of many natural and artificial systems. In this study, we develop\nmethods to optimize the synchronization stability of the Kuramoto model by\nminimizing the dominant Lyapunov exponent. With the help of the recently\nproposed cut-set space approximation of the steady states, we greatly simplify\nthe objective function, and further derive its gradient and Hessian with\nrespect to natural frequencies, which leads to an efficient algorithm with the\nquasi-Newton's method. The optimized systems are demonstrated to achieve better\nsynchronization stability for the Kuramoto model with or without inertia in\ncertain regimes. Hence our method is applicable in improving the stability of\npower grids. It is also viable to adjust the coupling strength of each link to\nimprove the stability of the system. Various operational constraints can also\nbe easily integrated into our scope by employing the interior point method in\nconvex optimization. The properties of the optimized networks are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  BICEP3 is a small-aperture refracting cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntelescope designed to make sensitive polarization maps in pursuit of a\npotential B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves. It is the latest\nin the BICEP/Keck Array series of CMB experiments at the South Pole, which has\nprovided the most stringent constraints on inflation to date. For the 2016\nobserving season, BICEP3 was outfitted with a full suite of 2400 optically\ncoupled detectors operating at 95 GHz. In these proceedings we report on the\nfar field beam performance using calibration data taken during the 2015-2016\nsummer deployment season in situ with a thermal chopped source. We generate\nhigh-fidelity per-detector beam maps, show the array-averaged beam profile, and\ncharacterize the differential beam response between co-located, orthogonally\npolarized detectors which contributes to the leading instrumental systematic in\npair differencing experiments. We find that the levels of differential\npointing, beamwidth, and ellipticity are similar to or lower than those\nmeasured for BICEP2 and Keck Array. The magnitude and distribution of BICEP3's\ndifferential beam mismatch - and the level to which temperature-to-polarization\nleakage may be marginalized over or subtracted in analysis - will inform the\ndesign of next-generation CMB experiments with many thousands of detectors.\n", "  BICEP3 is a 520 mm aperture, compact two-lens refractor designed to observe\nthe polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95 GHz. Its focal\nplane consists of modularized tiles of antenna-coupled transition edge sensors\n(TESs), similar to those used in BICEP2 and the Keck Array. The increased\nper-receiver optical throughput compared to BICEP2/Keck Array, due to both its\nfaster f/1.7 optics and the larger aperture, more than doubles the combined\nmapping speed of the BICEP/Keck program. The BICEP3 receiver was recently\nupgraded to a full complement of 20 tiles of detectors (2560 TESs) and is now\nbeginning its second year of observation (and first science season) at the\nSouth Pole. We report on its current performance and observing plans. Given its\nhigh per-receiver throughput while maintaining the advantages of a compact\ndesign, BICEP3-class receivers are ideally suited as building blocks for a\n3rd-generation CMB experiment, consisting of multiple receivers spanning 35 GHz\nto 270 GHz with total detector count in the tens of thousands. We present plans\nfor such an array, the new \"BICEP Array\" that will replace the Keck Array at\nthe South Pole, including design optimization, frequency coverage, and\ndeployment/observing strategies.\n", "  The presence of a planetary system can shield a planetesimal disk from the\nsecular gravitational perturbations due to distant outer massive objects\n(planets or stellar companions). As the host star evolves off the main sequence\nto become a white dwarf, these planets can be engulfed, triggering secular\ninstabilities and leading to the tidal disruptions of small rocky bodies. These\ndisrupted bodies can feed the white dwarfs with rocky material and possibly\nexplain the high-metallicity material in their atmospheres. We illustrate how\nthis mechanism can operate when the gravitational perturbations are due to the\nKozai-Lidov mechanism from a stellar binary companion. We show that this\nmechanism can explain the observed levels of accretion if: (1) the planetary\nengulfment happens fast compared to the secular timescale, which is generally\nthe case for wide binaries ($>100$ AU) and planetary engulfment during the\nAsymptotic Giant Branch; (2) the planetesimal disk has a total mass of\n$\\sim10^{-4}-10^{-2}M_\\oplus$. We show that this new mechanism can provide a\nsteady supply of material throughout the entire life of the white dwarfs for\nall cooling ages and can account for a large fraction (up to nearly half) of\nthe observed polluted WDs.\n", "  The AMPS paradox challenges black hole complementarity by apparently\nconstructing a way for an observer to bring information from the outside of the\nblack hole into its interior if there is no drama at its horizon, making\nmanifest a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We propose a new resolution\nto the paradox: this violation cannot be explicitly checked by an infalling\nobserver in the finite proper time they have to live after crossing the\nhorizon. Our resolution depends on a weak relaxation of the no-drama condition\n(we call it \"little drama\") which is the \"complementarity dual\" of scrambling\nof information on the stretched horizon. When translated to the description of\nthe black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information\nof infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while\nclassical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. Under the\nassumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we consider\nthe difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must perform\nafter crossing the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in order to\nverify a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We find that the time required\nto complete a necessary subroutine of this task, namely the decoding of Bell\npairs from the interior and the late radiation, takes longer than the maximum\namount of time that an observer can spend inside the black hole before hitting\nthe singularity. Therefore, an infalling observer cannot observe monogamy\nviolation before encountering the singularity.\n", "  Recently, Tao and Mo developed a new nonempirical semilocal\nexchange-correlation density functional. The exchange part of this functional\nis derived from a density matrix expansion corrected to reproduce the\nfourth-order gradient expansion in the slowly varying limit, while the\ncorrelation part is based on the TPSS correlation model with a modification for\nthe low-density limit. In the present work, the Tao-Mo functional is assessed\nby calculations on a variety of solids and jellium surfaces. This includes 22\nlattice constants and bulk moduli, 7 cohesive energies, and jellium surface\nexchange and correlation energies for the density parameter rs in the range\nfrom 2 to 3 bohrs. Our calculations show that this meta-generalized gradient\napproximation can yield consistently remarkable accuracy for the properties\nconsidered here, with mean absolute errors of 0.017 {\\AA} for lattice\nconstants, 7.0 GPa for bulk moduli, 0.08 eV for cohesive energies, and 35\nerg/cm2 for surface exchange-correlation energies, substantially improving upon\nexisting nonempirical semilocal density functionals.\n", "  We consider, in the context of a braneworld cosmology, the motion of the\nuniverse coupled to a four-form gauge field, with constant field strength,\ndefined in higher dimensions. It is found, under rather general initial\nconditions, that in this situation there is a period of exponential inflation\ncombined with cyclotron motion in the inflaton field space. The main effect of\nthe cyclotron motion is that conditions on the flatness of the inflaton\npotential, which are typically necessary for exponential inflation, can be\nevaded. There are Landau levels associated with the four-form gauge field, and\nthese correspond to quantum excitations of the inflaton field.\n", "  A general method is presented to calculate absolute binding energies of core\nlevels in metals and insulators, based on a penalty functional and an exact\nCoulomb cutoff method in a framework of the density functional theory. The\nspurious interaction of core holes between supercells is avoided by the exact\nCoulomb cutoff method, while the variational penalty functional enables us to\ntreat multiplet splittings due to chemical shift, spin-orbit coupling, and\nexchange interaction on equal footing, both of which are not accessible by\nprevious methods. It is demonstrated that the absolute binding energies of core\nlevels for both metals and insulators are calculated by the proposed method in\na mean absolute (percentage) error of 0.4 eV (0.16~\\%) for eight cases compared\nto experimental values measured with X-ray photoemission spectroscopy within a\ngeneralized gradient approximation to the exchange-correlation functional.\n", "  The impact of flexoelectric coupling on polarization reversal kinetics and\nspace charge dynamics in thin films of ferroelectric-semiconductors has been\ntheoretically studied. The relaxation-type Landau-Khalatnikov equation together\nwith the Poisson equation and the theory of elasticity equations have been used\nto calculate in a self-consistent way the spatial-temporal development of\nferroelectric polarization, electric potential and space charge, elastic\nstresses, strains and their gradients. The analysis of the obtained results\nreveals a moderate increase of the flexocoupling influence on the polarization,\nelastic strain, electric potential and space charge distribution dynamics with\nthe decrease of a ferroelectric film thickness. In contrast, the dependence of\npolarization switching time on the applied electric field is strongly affected\nby the flexocoupling strength. The polarization reversal process consists\ntypically of two stages, the first stage has no characteristic time, while the\nsecond one exhibits a switching time strongly dependent on the applied electric\nfield.\n", "  The next generation Advanced ACTPol (AdvACT) experiment is currently underway\nand will consist of four Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometer arrays, with\nthree operating together, totaling ~5800 detectors on the sky. Building on\nexperience gained with the ACTPol detector arrays, AdvACT will utilize various\nnew technologies, including 150mm detector wafers equipped with multichroic\npixels, allowing for a more densely packed focal plane. Each set of detectors\nincludes a feedhorn array of stacked silicon wafers which form a spline profile\nleading to each pixel. This is then followed by a waveguide interface plate,\ndetector wafer, back short cavity plate, and backshort cap. Each array is\nhoused in a custom designed structure manufactured from high purity copper and\nthen gold plated. In addition to the detector array assembly, the array package\nalso encloses cryogenic readout electronics. We present the full mechanical\ndesign of the AdvACT high frequency (HF) detector array package along with a\ndetailed look at the detector array stack assemblies. This experiment will also\nmake use of extensive hardware and software previously developed for ACT, which\nwill be modified to incorporate the new AdvACT instruments. Therefore, we\ndiscuss the integration of all AdvACT arrays with pre-existing ACTPol\ninfrastructure.\n", "  We present for the first time a determination of the energy dependence of the\nisoscalar $\\pi\\pi$ elastic scattering phase-shift within a first-principles\nnumerical lattice approach to QCD. Hadronic correlation functions are computed\nincluding all required quark propagation diagrams, and from these the discrete\nspectrum of states in the finite volume defined by the lattice boundary is\nextracted. From the volume dependence of the spectrum we obtain the $S$-wave\nphase-shift up to the $K\\overline{K}$ threshold. Calculations are performed at\ntwo values of the $u,d$ quark mass corresponding to $m_\\pi = 236, 391$ MeV and\nthe resulting amplitudes are described in terms of a $\\sigma$ meson which\nevolves from a bound-state below $\\pi\\pi$ threshold at the heavier quark mass,\nto a broad resonance at the lighter quark mass.\n", "  Advanced ACTPol is an instrument upgrade for the six-meter Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope (ACT) designed to measure the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature and polarization with arcminute-scale angular resolution. To\nachieve its science goals, Advanced ACTPol utilizes a larger readout\nmultiplexing factor than any previous CMB experiment to measure detector arrays\nwith approximately two thousand transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers in each\n150 mm detector wafer. We present the implementation and testing of the\nAdvanced ACTPol time-division multiplexing readout architecture with a 64-row\nmultiplexing factor. This includes testing of individual multichroic detector\npixels and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) multiplexing\nchips as well as testing and optimizing of the integrated readout electronics.\nIn particular, we describe the new automated multiplexing SQUID tuning\nprocedure developed to select and optimize the thousands of SQUID parameters\nrequired to readout each Advanced ACTPol array. The multichroic detector pixels\nin each array use separate channels for each polarization and each of the two\nfrequencies, such that four TESes must be read out per pixel. Challenges\naddressed include doubling the number of detectors per multiplexed readout\nchannel compared to ACTPol and optimizing the Nyquist inductance to minimize\ndetector and SQUID noise aliasing.\n", "  The Primordial Inflation Polarization ExploreR (PIPER) is a balloon-borne\ntelescope designed to measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground on large angular scales. PIPER will map 85% of the sky at 200, 270,\n350, and 600 GHz over a series of 8 conventional balloon flights from the\nnorthern and southern hemispheres. The first science flight will use two 32x40\narrays of backshort-under-grid transition edge sensors, multiplexed in the time\ndomain, and maintained at 100 mK by a Continuous Adiabatic Demagnetization\nRefrigerator. Front-end cryogenic Variable-delay Polarization Modulators\nprovide systematic control by rotating linear to circular polarization at 3 Hz.\nTwin telescopes allow PIPER to measure Stokes I, Q, U, and V simultaneously.\nThe telescope is maintained at 1.5 K in an LHe bucket dewar. Cold optics and\nthe lack of a warm window permit sensitivity at the sky-background limit. The\nultimate science target is a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r ~ 0.007,\nfrom the reionization bump to l ~ 300. PIPER's first flight will be from the\nNorthern hemisphere, and overlap with the CLASS survey at lower frequencies. We\ndescribe the current status of the PIPER instrument.\n", "  The effects of laser-plasma interactions (LPI) on the dynamics of inertial\nconfinement fusion hohlraums is investigated via a new approach that\nself-consistently couples reduced LPI models into radiation-hydrodynamics\nnumerical codes. The interplay between hydrodynamics and LPI -- specifically\nstimulated Raman scatter (SRS) and crossed-beam energy transfer (CBET) --\nmostly occurs via momentum and energy deposition into Langmuir and ion acoustic\nwaves. This spatially redistributes energy coupling to the target, which\naffects the background plasma conditions and thus modifies laser propagation.\nThis model shows reduced CBET, and significant laser energy depletion by\nLangmuir waves, which reduce the discrepancy between modeling and data from\nhohlraum experiments on wall x-ray emission and capsule implosion shape.\n", "  We study whether the relaxion mechanism solves the Higgs hierarchy problem\nagainst a high scale inflation or a high reheating temperature. To accomplish\nthe mechanism, we consider the scenario that the Higgs vacuum expectation value\nis determined after inflation. We take into account the effects of the Hubble\ninduced mass and thermal one in the dynamics of the relaxion.\n", "  BICEP3, the latest telescope in the BICEP/Keck program, started science\nobservations in March 2016. It is a 550mm aperture refractive telescope\nobserving the polarization of the cosmic microwave background at 95 GHz. We\nshow the focal plane design and detector performance, including spectral\nresponse, optical efficiency and preliminary sensitivity of the upgraded\nBICEP3. We demonstrate 9.72$\\mu$K$\\sqrt{\\textrm{s}}$ noise performance of the\nBICEP3 receiver.\n", "  We explore the effects of specific assumptions in the subgrid models of star\nformation and stellar and AGN feedback on intrinsic alignments of galaxies in\ncosmological simulations of \"MassiveBlack-II\" family. Using smaller volume\nsimulations, we explored the parameter space of the subgrid star formation and\nfeedback model and found remarkable robustness of the observable statistical\nmeasures to the details of subgrid physics. The one observational probe most\nsensitive to modeling details is the distribution of misalignment angles. We\nhypothesize that the amount of angular momentum carried away by the galactic\nwind is the primary physical quantity that controls the orientation of the\nstellar distribution. Our results are also consistent with a similar study by\nthe EAGLE simulation team.\n", "  The operations model of the Paranal Observatory relies on the work of\nefficient staff to carry out all the daytime and nighttime tasks. This is\nhighly dependent on adequate training. The Paranal Science Operations\ndepartment (PSO) has a training group that devises a well-defined and\ncontinuously evolving training plan for new staff, in addition to broadening\nand reinforcing courses for the whole department. This paper presents the\ntraining activities for and by PSO, including recent astronomical and quality\ncontrol training for operators, as well as adaptive optics and interferometry\ntraining of all staff. We also present some future plans.\n", "  This paper describes the Bayesian Technique for Multi-image Analysis\n(BaTMAn), a novel image-segmentation technique based on Bayesian statistics\nthat characterizes any astronomical dataset containing spatial information and\nperforms a tessellation based on the measurements and errors provided as input.\nThe algorithm iteratively merges spatial elements as long as they are\nstatistically consistent with carrying the same information (i.e. identical\nsignal within the errors). We illustrate its operation and performance with a\nset of test cases including both synthetic and real Integral-Field\nSpectroscopic data. The output segmentations adapt to the underlying spatial\nstructure, regardless of its morphology and/or the statistical properties of\nthe noise. The quality of the recovered signal represents an improvement with\nrespect to the input, especially in regions with low signal-to-noise ratio.\nHowever, the algorithm may be sensitive to small-scale random fluctuations, and\nits performance in presence of spatial gradients is limited. Due to these\neffects, errors may be underestimated by as much as a factor of two. Our\nanalysis reveals that the algorithm prioritizes conservation of all the\nstatistically-significant information over noise reduction, and that the\nprecise choice of the input data has a crucial impact on the results. Hence,\nthe philosophy of BaTMAn is not to be used as a `black box' to improve the\nsignal-to-noise ratio, but as a new approach to characterize spatially-resolved\ndata prior to its analysis. The source code is publicly available at\nhttp://astro.ft.uam.es/SELGIFS/BaTMAn .\n", "  A search for a new scalar field, called moduli, has been performed using the\ncryogenic resonant-mass AURIGA detector. Predicted by string theory, moduli may\nprovide a significant contribution to the dark matter (DM) component of our\nuniverse. If this is the case, the interaction of ordinary matter with the\nlocal DM moduli, forming the Galaxy halo, will cause an oscillation of solid\nbodies with a frequency corresponding to the mass of moduli. In the sensitive\nband of AURIGA, some $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ at around $1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, the\nexpected signal, with a $Q=\\tfrac{\\triangle f}{f}\\sim10^{6}$, is a narrow peak,\n$\\triangle f\\sim1\\,\\mathrm{mHz}$. Here the detector strain sensitivity is\n$h_{s}\\sim2\\times10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$, within a factor of $2$. These\nnumbers translate to upper limits at $95\\%\\,C.L.$ on the moduli coupling to\nordinary matter $d_{e}\\lesssim10^{-5}$ around masses\n$m_{\\phi}=3.6\\cdot10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, for the standard DM halo model with\n$\\rho_{DM}=0.3\\,\\mathrm{GeV/cm^{3}}$.\n", "  The resistivities of the dilute, strongly-interacting 2D electron systems in\nthe insulating phase of a silicon MOSFET are the same for unpolarized electrons\nin the absence of magnetic field and for electrons that are fully spin\npolarized by the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In both cases the\nresistivity obeys Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping $\\rho(T) = \\rho_0\n\\mbox{exp}[(T_{ES}/T)^{1/2}]$, with $T_{ES}$ and $1/\\rho_0$ mapping onto each\nother if one applies a shift of the critical density $n_c$ reported earlier.\nWith and withoug magnetic field, the parameters $T_{ES}$ and $1/\\rho_0 =\n\\sigma_0$ exhibit scaling consistent with critical behavior approaching a\nmetal-insulator transition.\n", "  The generation of photocurrent in an ideal two-dimensional Dirac spectrum is\nsymmetry-forbidden. In sharp contrast, we show that three-dimensional Weyl\nsemimetals can generically support significant photocurrent generations due to\nthe combination of inversion symmetry breaking and finite tilts of the Weyl\nspectra. Symmetry properties, chirality relations and various dependences on\nthe system and light sources are explored in details. Our results suggest that\nnoncentrosymmetric Weyl materials can be advantageously applied to room\ntemperature detections of mid- and far-infrared radiations.\n", "  Dynamical back-action cooling of phonons in optomechanical systems having one\noptical mode is well studied. Systems with two optical modes have the potential\nto reach significantly higher cooling rate through resonant enhancement of both\npump and scattered light. Here we experimentally investigate the role of dual\noptical densities of states on optomechanical cooling, and the deviation from\ntheory caused by thermal locking to the pump laser. Using this, we demonstrate\na room temperature system operating very close to the strong coupling regime,\nwhere saturation of cooling is anticipated.\n", "  Several directional techniques have been proposed for a directional detection\nof Dark matter, among others anisotropic crystal detectors, nuclear emulsion\nplates, and low-pressure gaseous TPCs. The key point is to get access to the\ninitial direction of the nucleus recoiling due to the elastic scattering by a\nWIMP. In this article, we aim at estimating, for each method, how the\ninformation of the recoil track initial direction is preserved in different\ndetector materials. We use the SRIM simulation code to emulate the motion of\nthe first recoiling nucleus in each material. We propose the use of a new\nobservable, D, to quantify the preservation of the initial direction of the\nrecoiling nucleus in the detector. We show that in an emulsion mix and an\nanisotropic crystal, the initial direction is lost very early, while in a\ntypical TPC gas mix, the direction is well preserved.\n", "  Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetimes generalize the Schwarzschild solution\nto include a massless scalar field. Although suffering from naked\nsingularities, they share the `frozen star' features of Schwarzschild black\nholes. Cosmological versions of the JNW spacetimes were discovered some time\nago by Husain, Martinez and Nunez and by Fonarev. Unlike Schwarzschild-deSitter\nblack holes, these solutions are dynamical, and the scarcity of exact solutions\nfor dynamical black holes in cosmological backgrounds motivates their further\nstudy. Here we show how the cosmological JNW spacetimes can be built, starting\nfrom simpler, static, higher dimensional, vacuum `JNW brane' solutions via two\ndifferent generalized dimensional reduction schemes that together cover the\nfull range of JNW parameter space. Cosmological versions of a BPS limit of\ncharged dilaton black holes are also known. JNW spacetimes represent a\ndifferent limiting case of the charged, dilaton black hole family. We expect\nthat understanding this second data point may be key to finding cosmological\nversions of general, non-BPS black holes.\n", "  We develop and apply the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique to address the\nproblem of stability of the Dirac liquid state (in a graphene type system)\nagainst strong long-range part of the Coulomb interaction. So far, all attempts\nto deal with this problem in the field-theoretical framework were limited\neither to perturbative or RPA treatments, with diametrically opposite\nconclusions. Our calculations aim at the approximations-free solution with\ncontrolled accuracy by computing vertex corrections from higher-order skeleton\ndiagrams and establishing the renormalization group flow of the effective\nCoulomb coupling constant. We unambiguously show that with increasing the\nsystem size $L$ (up to $ln(L) \\sim 40$), the coupling constant always flows\ntowards zero; i.e. the two dimensional Dirac liquid is an asymptotically free\n$T=0$ state with divergent Fermi velocity.\n", "  It has been proved that network structure plays an important role in\naddressing a collective behaviour. In this paper we consider a network of firms\nand corporations and study its metastable features in an Ising based model. In\nour model, we observe that if in a recession the government imposes a demand\nshock to stimulate the network, metastable features shape its response.\nActually we find that there is a minimum bound where demand shocks with a size\nbelow it are unable to trigger the market out from recession. We then\ninvestigate the impact of network characteristics on this minimum bound. We\nsurprisingly observe that in a Watts-Strogatz network though the minimum bound\ndepends on the average of the degrees, when translated into the economics\nlanguage, such a bound is independent of the average degrees. This bound is\nabout $0.44 \\Delta$GDP, where $\\Delta$GDP is the gap of GDP between recession\nand expansion. We examine our suggestions for the cases of the United States\nand the European Union in the recent recession, and compare them with the\nimposed stimulations. While stimulation in the US has been above our threshold,\nin the EU it has been far below our threshold. Beside providing a minimum bound\nfor a successful stimulation, our study on the metastable features suggests\nthat in the time of crisis there is a \"golden time passage\" in which the\nminimum bound for successful stimulation can be much lower. So, our study\nstrongly suggests stimulations to be started within this time passage.\n", "  We consider cosmological backreaction effects in Buchert's averaging\nformalism on the basis of an explicit solution of the Lema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi\n(LTB) dynamics which is linear in the LTB curvature parameter and has an\ninhomogeneous bang time. The volume Hubble rate is found in terms of the volume\nscale factor which represents a derivation of the simplest phenomenological\nsolution of Buchert's equations in which the fractional densities corresponding\nto average curvature and kinematic backreaction are explicitly determined by\nthe parameters of the underlying LTB solution at the boundary of the averaging\nvolume. This configuration represents an exactly solvable toy model but it does\nnot adequately describe our \"real\" Universe.\n", "  We study the tunable photonic distribution in an optical molecule consisting\nof two linearly coupled single-mode cavities. With the inter-cavity coupling\nand two driving fields, the energy levels of the optical-molecule system form a\nclosed cyclic energy-level diagram, and the phase difference between the\ndriving fields serves as a sensitive controller on the dynamics of the system.\nDue to the quantum interference effect, we can realize a partially dark optical\nmolecule, where the steady-state mean photon number in one of the cavities\nachieves zero even under the external driving. And the dark cavity can be\nchanged from one of the cavities to the other by only adjusting the phase\ndifference. Furthermore, we show that when one of the cavities couples with an\natomic ensemble, it will be dark under the same condition as that without\natoms, but the condition for the other cavity to be dark is modified.\n", "  We present a theory of optical conductivity in systems with finite-momentum\nCooper pairs. In contrast to the BCS pairing where AC conductivity is purely\nimaginary in the clean limit, there is nonzero AC absorption across the\nsuperconducting gap for finite-momentum pairing if we break the Galilean\nsymmetry explicitly in the electronic Hamiltonian. Vertex correction is crucial\nfor maintaining the gauge invariance in the mean-field formalism and\ndramatically changes the optical conductivity in the direction of the pairing\nmomentum. We carried out a self-consistent calculation and gave an explicit\nformula for optical conductivity in a simple case. This result applies to the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and candidates with pair density waves\nproposed for High- Tc cuprates. It may help detect PDW and determine the\npairing gap as well as the direction of the pairing momentum in experiments.\n", "  The angular momentum properties of virialised dark matter haloes have been\nmeasured with good statistics in collisionless N-body simulations, but an\nequally accurate analysis of the baryonic spin is still missing. We employ the\nIllustris simulation suite, one of the first simulations of galaxy formation\nwith full hydrodynamics that produces a realistic galaxy population in a\nsizeable volume, to quantify the baryonic spin properties for more than $\\sim$\n320,000 haloes. We first compare the systematic differences between different\nspin parameter and halo definitions, and the impact of sample selection\ncriteria on the derived properties. We confirm that dark matter only haloes\nexhibit a close to self-similar spin distribution in mass and redshift of\nlognormal form. However, the physics of galaxy formation radically changes the\nbaryonic spin distribution. While the dark matter component remains largely\nunaffected, strong trends with mass and redshift appear for the spin of diffuse\ngas and the formed stellar component. With time the baryons staying bound to\nthe halo develop a misalignment of their spin vector with respect to dark\nmatter, and increase their specific angular momentum by a factor of $\\sim$ 1.3\nin the non-radiative case and $\\sim$ 1.8 in the full physics setup at z = 0. We\nshow that this enhancement in baryonic spin can be explained by the combined\neffect of specific angular momentum transfer from dark matter onto gas during\nmergers and from feedback expelling low specific angular momentum gas from the\nhalo. Our results challenge certain models for spin evolution and underline the\nsignificant changes induced by baryonic physics in the structure of haloes.\n", "  The interesting physics and potential memory technologies resulting from\ntopologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions, has prompted efforts\nto discover new material systems that can host these kind of magnetic\nstructures. Here we use the highly tunable magnetic properties of amorphous\nFe/Gd multilayer films to explore the magnetic properties that lead to\ndipole-stabilized skyrmions and skyrmion lattices that form from the\ncompetition of dipolar field and exchange energy. Using both real space imaging\nand reciprocal space scattering techniques we determined the range of material\nproperties and magnetic fields where skyrmions form. Micromagnetic modeling\nclosely matches our observation of small skyrmion features (~50 to 70nm) and\nsuggests these class of skyrmions have a rich domain structure that is Bloch\nlike in the center of the film and more N\\'eel like towards each surface. Our\nresults provide a pathway to engineer the formation and controllability of\ndipole skyrmion phases in a thin film geometry at different temperatures and\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  We review the production function and the hypothesis of equilibrium in the\nneoclassical framework. We notify that in a soup of sectors in economy, while\ncapital and labor resemble extensive variables, wage and rate of return on\ncapital act as intensive variables. As a result, Baumol and Bowen's statement\nof equal wages is inevitable from the thermodynamics point of view. We try to\nsee how aggregation can be performed concerning the extensive variables in a\nsoup of firms. We provide a toy model to perform aggregation for production and\nthe labor income as extensive quantities in a neoclassical framework.\n", "  We present a study of the merger of six different known galactic systems of\nbinary neutron stars (BNS) of unequal mass with a mass ratio between $0.75$ and\n$0.99$. Specifically, these systems are J1756-2251, J0737-3039A, J1906+0746,\nB1534+12, J0453+1559 and B1913+16. We follow the dynamics of the merger from\nthe late stage of the inspiral process up to $\\sim$ 20 ms after the system has\nmerged, either to form a hyper-massive neutron star (NS) or a rotating black\nhole (BH), using a semi-realistic equation of state (EOS), namely the\nseven-segment piece-wise polytropic SLy with a thermal component. For the most\nextreme of these systems ($q=0.75$, J0453+1559), we also investigate the\neffects of different EOSs: APR4, H4, and MS1. Our numerical simulations are\nperformed using only publicly available open source code such as, the Einstein\nToolkit code deployed for the dynamical evolution and the LORENE code for the\ngeneration of the initial models. We show results on the gravitational wave\nsignals, spectrogram and frequencies of the BNS after the merger and the BH\nproperties in the two cases in which the system collapse within the simulated\ntime.\n", "  POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization\nexperiment that will be located in the Atacama highland in Chile at an altitude\nof 5200 m. Its science goals are to measure the CMB polarization signals\noriginating from both primordial gravitational waves and weak lensing. PB-2 is\ndesigned to measure the tensor to scalar ratio, r, with precision {\\sigma}(r) <\n0.01, and the sum of neutrino masses, {\\Sigma}m{\\nu}, with\n{\\sigma}({\\Sigma}m{\\nu}) < 90 meV. To achieve these goals, PB-2 will employ\n7588 transition-edge sensor bolometers at 95 GHz and 150 GHz, which will be\noperated at the base temperature of 250 mK. Science observations will begin in\n2017.\n", "  Following earlier study regarding Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-massive black holes\nin the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear electromagnetic field [S. H. Hendi, B.\nEslam Panah and S. Panahiyan, arXiv:1510.00108], we study thermodynamical\nstructure and critical behavior of these black holes through various methods in\nthis paper. Geometrical thermodynamics is employed to give a picture regarding\nphase transition of these black holes. Next, a new method is used to derive\ncritical pressure and horizon radius of these black holes. In addition, Maxwell\nequal area law is employed to study the Van der Waals like behavior of these\nblack holes. Moreover, the critical exponents are calculated and by using\nEhrenfest equations, the type of the phase transitions are determined.\n", "  We study here fractional orbital angular momentum (OAM) states in electron\nvortex beams (EVB) from the perspective of geometric phase. We have considered\nthe skyrmionic model of an electron, where it is depicted as a scalar electron\norbiting around the vortex line, which gives rise to the spin degrees of\nfreedom. The geometric phase acquired by the scalar electron orbiting around\nthe vortex line induces the spin-orbit interaction, which leads to the\nfractional OAM states with non-quantized monopole charge associated with the\ncorresponding geometric phase. This involves tilted vortex in EVBs. The\nmonopole charge undergoes the renormalization group (RG) flow, which\nincorporates a length scale dependence making the fractional OAM states\nunstable upon propagation. It is pointed out that when EVBs move in an external\nmagnetic field, the Gouy phase associated with the Laguerre-Gaussian modes\nmodifies the geometric phase factor and a proper choice of the radial index\nhelps to have a stable fractional OAM state.\n", "  HfS is a tool to fit the hyperfine structure of spectral lines, with multiple\nvelocity components. The HfS_nh3 procedures included in HfS fit simultaneously\nthe hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$ (J,K)= (1,1) and (2,2) transitions, and\nperform a standard analysis to derive $T_\\mathrm{ex}$, NH$_3$ column density,\n$T_\\mathrm{rot}$, and $T_\\mathrm{k}$. HfS uses a Monte Carlo approach for\nfitting the line parameters. Especial attention is paid to the derivation of\nthe parameter uncertainties. HfS includes procedures that make use of parallel\ncomputing for fitting spectra from a data cube.\n", "  Stacking cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps around known galaxy clusters\nand groups provides a powerful probe of the distribution of hot gas in these\nsystems via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. A stacking analysis allows one\nto detect the average SZ signal around low mass halos, and to extend\nmeasurements out to large scales, which are too faint to detect individually in\nthe SZ or in X-ray emission. In addition, cross correlations between SZ maps\nand other tracers of large-scale structure (with known redshifts) can be used\nto extract the redshift-dependence of the SZ background. Motivated by these\nexciting prospects, we measure the two-point cross-correlation function between\na catalog of $\\sim 380,000$ galaxy groups (with redshifts spanning\n$z=0.01-0.2$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Compton-y parameter\nmaps constructed by the Planck collaboration. We find statistically significant\ncorrelations between the group catalog and Compton-y maps in each of six\nseparate mass bins, with estimated halo masses in the range $10^{11.5-15.5}\nM_\\odot/h$. We compare these measurements with halo models of the SZ signal,\nwhich describe the stacked measurement in terms of one-halo and two-halo terms.\nThe one-halo term quantifies the average pressure profile around the groups in\na mass bin, while the two-halo term describes the contribution of correlated\nneighboring halos. For the more massive groups we find clear evidence for the\none- and two-halo regimes, while groups with mass below $10^{13} M_\\odot/h$ are\ndominated by the two-halo term given the resolution of Planck data. We use the\nsignal in the two-halo regime to determine the bias-weighted electron pressure\nof the universe: $\\langle b P_e \\rangle= 1.50 \\pm 0.226 \\times 10^{-7}$ keV\ncm$^{-3}$ (1-$\\sigma$) at $z\\approx 0.15$.\n", "  Inspired by the chromo-natural inflation model of Adshead&Wyman, we reshape\nits scalar content to relax the tension with current observational bounds.\nBesides an inflaton, the setup includes a spectator sector in which an axion\nand SU(2) gauge fields are coupled via a Chern-Simons-type term. The result is\na viable theory endowed with an alternative production mechanism for\ngravitational waves during inflation. The gravitational wave signal sourced by\nthe spectator fields can be much larger than the contribution from standard\nvacuum fluctuations, it is distinguishable from the latter on the basis of its\nchirality and, depending on the theory parameters values, also its tilt. This\nproduction process breaks the well-known relation between the tensor-to-scalar\nratio and the energy scale of inflation. As a result, even if the Hubble rate\nis itself too small for the vacuum to generate a tensor amplitude detectable by\nupcoming experiments, this model still supports observable gravitational waves.\n", "  We make quantitative estimates of the power supplied to the Galactic cosmic\nray population by second-order Fermi acceleration in the interstellar medium,\nor as it is usually termed in cosmic ray propagation studies, diffusive\nreacceleration. Using recent results on the local interstellar spectrum from\nthe Voyager missions we show that for parameter values, in particular the\nAlfv\\'en speed, typically used in propagation codes such as Galprop to fit the\nB/C ratio, the power contributed by diffusive reacceleration is significant and\ncan be of order 50\\% of the total Galactic cosmic ray power. The implications\nfor the damping of interstellar turbulence are briefly considered.\n", "  Route & Wolszczan (2016) recently detected five radio bursts from the T6\ndwarf WISEP J112254.73+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose\nthat this object rotates with an ultra-short period of ~17.3 minutes. We\nconducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but\nfound no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable,\nhighly circularly polarized radio emission possibly with a period of 116\nminutes, although our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are\nneeded to confirm it. Our proposed periodicity is typical of other radio-active\nultracool dwarfs. The handedness of the circular polarization alternates with\ntime and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first\ntime such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass\nstars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object's magnetic dipole axis may\nbe highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis.\n", "  When magnetic field $B$ is applied to a metal, nearly all observable\nquantities exhibit oscillations periodic in $1/B$. Such quantum oscillations\nreflect the fundamental reorganization of electron states into Landau levels as\na canonical response of the metal to the applied magnetic field. We predict\nhere that, remarkably, in the recently discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals\nquantum oscillations can occur in the complete absence of magnetic field. These\nzero-field quantum oscillations are driven by elastic strain which, in the\nspace of the low-energy Dirac fermions, acts as a chiral gauge potential. We\npropose an experimental setup in which the strain in a thin film (or nanowire)\ncan generate pseudomagnetic field $b$ as large as 15T and demonstrate the\nresulting de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations periodic in\n$1/b$.\n", "  Reionisation in the early Universe is likely driven by dwarf galaxies. Using\ncosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we study star formation and\nthe escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons from mini-haloes with $M_{\\rm halo}\n\\le 10^8\\,M_\\odot$. Our simulations include a new thermo-turbulent star\nformation model, non-equilibrium chemistry, and relevant stellar feedback\nprocesses (photoionisation by young massive stars, radiation pressure, and\nmechanical supernova explosions). We find that feedback reduces star formation\nvery efficiently in mini-haloes, resulting in the stellar mass consistent with\nthe slope and normalisation reported in Kimm \\& Cen and the empirical stellar\nmass-to-halo mass relation derived in the local Universe. Because star\nformation is stochastic and dominated by a few gas clumps, the escape fraction\nin mini-haloes is generally determined by radiation feedback (heating due to\nphoto-ionisation), rather than supernova explosions. We also find that the\nphoton number-weighted mean escape fraction in mini-haloes is higher\n($\\sim20$-$40\\%$) than that in atomic-cooling haloes, although the\ninstantaneous fraction in individual haloes varies significantly. The escape\nfraction from Pop III stars is found to be significant ($\\ge10\\%$) only when\nthe mass is greater than $\\sim$100\\,\\msun. Based on simple analytic\ncalculations, we show that LyC photons from mini-haloes are, despite their high\nescape fractions, of minor importance for reionisation due to inefficient star\nformation. We confirm previous claims that stars in atomic-cooling haloes with\nmasses $10^8\\,M_\\odot\\le M_{\\rm halo} \\le 10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$ are likely to be\nthe most important source of reionisation.\n", "  Recent advances in attosecond physics provide access to the correlated motion\nof valence and core electrons on their intrinsic timescales. For valence\nexcitations, processes related to the electron spin are usually driven by\nnuclear motion. For core-excited states, where the core hole has a nonzero\nangular momentum, spin-orbit coupling is strong enough to drive spin-flips on a\nmuch shorter time scale. Here, unprecedented short spin-crossover driven by\nspin-orbit coupling is demonstrated for L-edge (2p$\\rightarrow$3d) excited\nstates of a prototypical Fe(II) complex. It occurs on a time scale, which is\nfaster than the core hole lifetime of about 4~fs. A detailed analysis of such\nphenomena will\n", "  We studied AGN activity in twelve LSSs in the ORELSE survey, at 0.65<z<1.28,\nusing a combination of Chandra observations, optical and NIR imaging and\nspectroscopy. We located a total of 61 AGNs across our sample that were\nsuccessfully matched to optical counterparts in the LSSs. Seeking to study AGN\ntriggering mechanisms, we examined the spatial distribution of the AGNs and\ntheir average spectral properties. We found that AGN populations across our\nsample had less time since the last starburst than the overall galaxy\npopulations. We did not find any relation between AGN activity and location\nwithin the LSSs, suggesting triggering mechanisms which depend on global\nenvironment are at most sub-dominant. To focus on differences between our AGNs,\nwe grouped them into four sub-samples based on the spectral properties of their\nparents LSSs. We found one of the sub-samples, SG0023 & SC1604, stood out from\nthe others: AGNs in this sample were disproportionately luminous, their average\ntime since the last starburst event was the smallest, despite the fact that\nthis was not true of the overall galaxy population in those LSSs, and both the\nAGNs and the overall galaxy population had the largest fraction of close\nkinematic pairs, which indicates a higher rate of galaxy mergers and\ninteractions. These results suggest that major mergers are driving AGN activity\nin SG0023 & SC1604, while other processes are likely triggering less luminous\nAGNs in the rest of our sample. Additionally, minor mergers are unlikely to\nplay a significant role, since the same conditions that lead to more major\nmergers should should also lead to more minor mergers, which is not observed in\nSG0023 & SC1604.\n", "  The ultra-faint satellite galaxy Hercules has a strongly elongated and\nirregular morphology with detections of tidal features up to 1.3 deg (3 kpc)\nfrom its center. This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky\nWay's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation\nrather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference\nin combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a\nvery eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On\nsuch an orbit, Hercules \"explodes\" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at\npericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its\norbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially\noutwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical\nnature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to\nits orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a\ndistance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is\nsignificantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving\nperpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in\nthe radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that\nformed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic\nsubstructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on\nsuch a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic\npotential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of\nHercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints\non the potential of the Milky Way.\n", "  Recently Witten introduced a type IIB brane construction with certain\nboundary conditions to study knot invariants and Khovanov homology. The\nessential ingredients used in his work are the topologically twisted N = 4\nYang-Mills theory, localization equations and surface operators. In this paper\nwe extend his construction in two possible ways. On one hand we show that a\nslight modification of Witten's brane construction could lead, using certain\nwell defined duality transformations, to the model used by Ooguri-Vafa to study\nknot invariants using gravity duals. On the other hand, we argue that both\nthese constructions, of Witten and of Ooguri-Vafa, lead to two different\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory from where the topological theories may\nappear from certain twisting of the G-flux action. The non-abelian nature of\nthe topological action may also be studied if we take the wrapped M2-brane\nstates in the theory. We discuss explicit constructions of the\nseven-dimensional manifolds in M-theory, and show that both the localization\nequations and surface operators appear naturally from the Hamiltonian formalism\nof the theories. Knots and link invariants are then constructed using M2-brane\nstates in both the models.\n", "  It is known that there are lattice models in which non-interacting particles\nget dynamically localized when periodic $\\delta$-function kicks are applied\nwith a particular strength. We use both numerical and analytical methods to\nstudy the effects of interactions in three different models in one dimension.\nThe systems we have considered include spinless fermions with interactions\nbetween nearest-neighbor sites, the Hubbard model of spin-1/2 fermions, and the\nBose Hubbard model with on-site interactions. We derive effective Floquet\nHamiltonians up to second order in the time period of kicking. Using these we\nshow that interactions can give rise to a variety of interesting results such\nas two-body bound states in all three models and dispersionless many-body bound\nstates for spinless fermions and bosons. We substantiate these results by exact\ndiagonalization and stroboscopic time evolution of systems with a finite number\nof particles. We derive a low-energy pseudo-spin-1/2 limit of the Bose Hubbard\nsystem in the thermodynamic limit and show that a special case of this has an\nexponentially large number of ground states. Finally we study the effect of\nchanging the strength of the $\\delta$-function kicks slightly away from perfect\ndynamical localization; we find that a single particle remains dynamically\nlocalized for a long time after which it moves ballistically.\n", "  We present 0\".2-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\nobservations at 870 um for 25 Halpha-seleced star-forming galaxies (SFGs)\naround the main-sequence at z=2.2-2.5. We detect significant 870 um continuum\nemission in 16 (64%) of these SFGs. The high-resolution maps reveal that the\ndust emission is mostly radiated from a single region close to the galaxy\ncenter. Exploiting the visibility data taken over a wide $uv$ distance range,\nwe measure the half-light radii of the rest-frame far-infrared emission for the\nbest sample of 12 massive galaxies with logM*>11. We find nine galaxies to be\nassociated with extremely compact dust emission with R_{1/2,870um}<1.5 kpc,\nwhich is more than a factor of 2 smaller than their rest-optical sizes,\nR_{1/2,1.6um}=3.2 kpc, and is comparable with optical sizes of massive\nquiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. As they have an exponential disk with\nSersic index of n=1.2 in the rest-optical, they are likely to be in the\ntransition phase from extended disks to compact spheroids. Given their high\nstar formation rate surface densities within the central 1 kpc of Sigma\nSFR1kpc=40 Msol/yr/kpc^2, the intense circumnuclear starbursts can rapidly\nbuild up a central bulge with Sigma M*1kpc>1e10 Msol/kpc^2 in several hundred\nMyr, i.e. by z~2. Moreover, ionized gas kinematics reveal that they are\nrotation-supported with an angular momentum as large as that of typical SFGs at\nz=1-3. Our results suggest bulges are commonly formed in extended rotating\ndisks by internal processes, not involving major mergers.\n", "  Due to a strong spin-orbit interaction and a large Land\\'e g-factor, InSb\nplays an important role in research on Majorana fermions. To further explore\nnovel properties of Majorana fermions, hybrid devices based on quantum wells\nare conceived as an alternative approach to nanowires. In this work, we report\na pronounced conductance quantization of quantum point contact devices in\nInSb/InAlSb quantum wells. Using a rotating magnetic field, we observe a large\nin-plane (|g1|=26) and out-of-plane (|g1|=52) g-factor anisotropy.\nAdditionally, we investigate crossings of subbands with opposite spins and\nextract the electron effective mass from magnetic depopulation of\none-dimensional subbands.\n", "  We present a chemodynamical analysis of the Leo~V dwarf galaxy, based on Keck\nII DEIMOS spectra of 8 member stars. We find a systemic velocity for the system\nof $\\langle v_r\\rangle = 170.9^{+ 2.1}_{-1.9}$kms$^{-1}$, and barely resolve a\nvelocity dispersion for the system, with $\\sigma_{vr} =\n2.3^{+3.2}_{-1.6}$kms$^{-1}$, consistent with previous studies of Leo~V. The\npoorly resolved dispersion means we are unable to adequately constrain the dark\nmatter content of Leo~V. We find an average metallicity for the dwarf of\n[Fe/H]$ = -2.48\\pm0.21$, and measure a significant spread in the iron abundance\nof its member stars, with $-3.1\\le$[Fe/H]$\\le-1.9$ dex, which cleanly\nidentifies Leo~V as a dwarf galaxy that has been able to self-enrich its\nstellar population through extended star formation. Owing to the tentative\nphotometric evidence for tidal substructure around Leo~V, we also investigate\nwhether there is any evidence for tidal stripping or shocking of the system\nwithin its dynamics. We measure a significant velocity gradient across the\nsystem, of $\\frac{{\\rm d}v}{{\\rm d}\\chi} = -4.1^{+2.8}_{-2.6}$kms$^{-1}$ per\narcmin (or $\\frac{{\\rm d}v}{{\\rm d}\\chi} =\n-71.9^{+50.8}_{-45.6}$kms$^{-1}$~kpc$^{-1}$), which points almost directly\ntoward the Galactic centre. We argue that Leo~V is likely a dwarf on the brink\nof dissolution, having just barely survived a past encounter with the centre of\nthe Milky Way.\n", "  Following a recent proposal by Cooper and Zwanziger we investigate via\n$SU(2)$ lattice simulations the effect on the Coulomb gauge propagators and on\nthe Gribov-Zwanziger confinement mechanism of selecting the Gribov copy with\nthe smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of the Faddeev-Popov operator, i.e.~the one\nclosest to the Gribov horizon. Although such choice of gauge drives the ghost\npropagator towards the prediction of continuum calculations, we find that it\nactually overshoots the goal. With increasing computer time, we observe that\nGribov copies with arbitrarily small eigenvalues can be found. For such a\nmethod to work one would therefore need further restrictions on the gauge\ncondition to isolate the physically relevant copies, since e.g.~the Coulomb\npotential $V_C$ defined through the Faddeev-Popov operator becomes otherwise\nphysically meaningless. Interestingly, the Coulomb potential alternatively\ndefined through temporal link correlators is only marginally affected by the\nsmallness of the eigenvalues.\n", "  We construct the three-flavor Lorentz-invariant meson-baryon chiral\nLagrangians at the order $p^4$, with which a full one-loop investigation may be\nperformed. One obtains 540 independent terms. The processes with the minimal\nnumber of mesons and photons that this order Lagrangians may contribute to are\nalso presented.\n", "  We show that the recently introduced logarithmic metrics used to predict\ndisease arrival times on complex networks are approximations of more general\nnetwork-based measures derived from random walks theory. Using the daily\nair-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the\ninfection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by\naccounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The\ncomparison with direct simulations of arrival times reveals a higher\ncorrelation compared to the shortest path approach used previously. In addition\nour method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with\nthe cumulant generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our\nresults provides a general and computationally efficient approach to the\nproblem using only algebraic methods.\n", "  We use resonant elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering at the Ir-$L_3$ edge\nto study the doping-dependent magnetic order, magnetic excitations and\nspin-orbit excitons in the electron-doped bilayer iridate\n(Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$)$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \\leq x \\leq 0.065$). With increasing\ndoping $x$, the three-dimensional long range antiferromagnetic order is\ngradually suppressed and evolves into a three-dimensional short range order\nfrom $x = 0$ to $0.05$, followed by a transition to two-dimensional short range\norder between $x = 0.05$ and $0.065$. Following the evolution of the\nantiferromagnetic order, the magnetic excitations undergo damping, anisotropic\nsoftening and gap collapse, accompanied by weakly doping-dependent spin-orbit\nexcitons. Therefore, we conclude that electron doping suppresses the magnetic\nanisotropy and interlayer couplings and drives\n(Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$)$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ into a correlated metallic state hosting\ntwo-dimensional short range antiferromagnetic order and strong\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations of $J_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{2}$ moments, with\nthe magnon gap strongly suppressed.\n", "  The Porter-Thomas (PT) distribution of resonance widths is one of the oldest\nand simplest applications of statistical ideas in nuclear physics. Previous\nexperimental data confirmed it quite well but recent and more careful\ninvestigations show clear deviations from this distribution. To explain these\ndiscrepancies the authors of [PRL \\textbf{115}, 052501 (2015)] argued that to\nget a realistic model of nuclear resonances is not enough to consider one of\nthe standard random matrix ensembles which leads immediately to the PT\ndistribution but it is necessary to add a rank-one interaction which couples\nresonances to decay channels. The purpose of the paper is to solve this model\nanalytically and to find explicitly the modifications of the PT distribution\ndue to such interaction. Resulting formulae are simple, in a good agreement\nwith numerics, and could explain experimental results.\n", "  Line-of-sight integrals of the squared density, commonly called the J-factor,\nare essential for inferring dark matter annihilation signals. The J-factors of\ndark matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies (dSphs) have\ntypically been derived using Bayesian techniques, which for small data samples\nimplies that a choice of priors constitutes a non-negligible systematic\nuncertainty. Here we report the development of a new fully frequentist approach\nto construct the profile likelihood of the J-factor. Using stellar kinematic\ndata from several classical and ultra-faint dSphs, we derive the maximum\nlikelihood value for the J-factor and its confidence intervals. We validate\nthis method, in particular its bias and coverage, using simulated data from the\nGaia Challenge. We find that the method possesses good statistical properties.\nThe J-factors and their uncertainties are generally in good agreement with the\nBayesian-derived values, with the largest deviations restricted to the systems\nwith the smallest kinematic datasets. We discuss improvements, extensions, and\nfuture applications of this technique.\n", "  We compute one loop free energy for D=4 Vasiliev higher spin gravities based\non Konstein-Vasiliev algebras hu(m;n|4), ho(m;n|4) or husp(m;n|4) and subject\nto higher spin preserving boundary conditions, which are conjectured to be dual\nto the U(N), O(N) or USp(N) singlet sectors, respectively, of free CFTs on the\nboundary of $AdS_4$. Ordinary supersymmetric higher spin theories appear as\nspecial cases of Konstein-Vasiliev theories, when the corresponding higher spin\nalgebra contains $OSp({\\cal N}|4)$ as subalgebra. In $AdS_4$ with $S^3$\nboundary, we use a modified spectral zeta function method, which avoids the\nambiguity arising from summing over infinite number of spins. We find that the\ncontribution of the infinite tower of bulk fermions vanishes. As a result, the\nfree energy is the sum of those which arise in type A and type B models with\ninternal symmetries, the known mismatch between the bulk and boundary free\nenergies for type B model persists, and ordinary supersymmetric higher spin\ntheories exhibit the mismatch as well. The only models that have a match are\ntype A models with internal symmetries, corresponding to $n=0$. The matching\nrequires identification of the inverse Newton's constant $G_N^{-1}$ with $N$\nplus a proper integer as was found previously for special cases. In $AdS_4$\nwith $S^1\\times S^2$ boundary, the bulk one loop free energies match those of\nthe dual free CFTs for arbitrary $m$ and $n$. We also show that a\nsupersymmetric double-trace deformation of free CFT based on OSp(1|4) does not\ncontribute to the ${\\cal O}(N^0)$ free energy, as expected from the bulk.\n", "  We report constraints on spin-independent weakly interacting massive particle\n(WIMP)-nucleon scattering using a 3.35e4 kg-day exposure of the Large\nUnderground Xenon (LUX) experiment. A dual-phase xenon time projection chamber\nwith 250 kg of active mass is operated at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility under Lead, South Dakota (USA). With roughly fourfold improvement in\nsensitivity for high WIMP masses relative to our previous results, this search\nyields no evidence of WIMP nuclear recoils. At a WIMP mass of 50 GeV/c^2,\nWIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross sections above 2.2e-46 cm^2 are excluded at\nthe 90% confidence level. When combined with the previously reported LUX\nexposure, this exclusion strengthens to 1.1e-46 cm^2 at 50 GeV/c^2.\n", "  The atmospheres filling massive galaxies, groups, and clusters display\nremarkable similarities with rainfalls. Such plasma halos are shaped by AGN\nheating and subsonic turbulence (~150 km/s), as probed by Hitomi. The new 3D\nhigh-resolution simulations show the soft X-ray (< 1 keV) plasma cools rapidly\nvia radiative emission at the high-density interface of the turbulent eddies,\nstimulating a top-down condensation cascade of warm, $10^4$ K filaments. The\nionized (optical/UV) filaments extend up to several kpc and form a skin\nenveloping the neutral filaments (optical/IR/21-cm). The peaks of the warm\nfilaments further condense into cold molecular clouds (<50 K; radio) with total\nmass up to several $10^7$ M$_\\odot$, i.e., 5/50$\\times$ the neutral/ionized\nmasses. The multiphase structures inherit the chaotic kinematics and are\ndynamically supported. In the inner 500 pc, the clouds collide in inelastic\nway, mixing angular momentum and leading to chaotic cold accretion (CCA). The\nBHAR can be modeled via quasi-spherical viscous accretion with collisional mean\nfree path ~100 pc. Beyond the inner kpc region pressure torques drive the\nangular momentum transport. In CCA, the BHAR is recurrently boosted up to 2 dex\ncompared with the disc evolution, which arises as turbulence is subdominant.\nThe CCA BHAR distribution is lognormal with pink noise power spectrum\ncharacteristic of fractal phenomena. The rapid self-similar CCA variability can\nexplain the light curve variability of AGN and HMXBs. An improved criterium to\ntrace thermal instability is proposed. The 3-phase CCA reproduces crucial\nobservations of cospatial multiphase gas in massive galaxies, as Chandra X-ray\nimages, SOAR H$\\alpha$ warm filaments and kinematics, Herschel [C$^+$]\nemission, and ALMA giant molecular associations. CCA plays key role in AGN\nfeedback, AGN unification/obscuration, the evolution of BHs, galaxies, and\nclusters.\n", "  We use the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation to study the magnitude and origin\nof the scatter in the stellar mass - halo mass relation for central galaxies.\nWe separate cause and effect by correlating stellar masses in the baryonic\nsimulation with halo properties in a matched dark matter only (DMO) simulation.\nThe scatter in stellar mass increases with redshift and decreases with halo\nmass. At $z = 0.1$ it declines from 0.25 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx\n10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to 0.12 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx 10^{13}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, but the trend is weak above $10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. For $M_{200,\n\\rm DMO} < 10^{12.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to\nscatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass\ncorresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher\nconcentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion\nand star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with\nhigher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, $V_{\\rm max, DMO}$, and\nbinding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass,\nmeaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide\nfitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass. However, concentration\nalone cannot explain the total scatter in the $M_{\\rm star} - M_{200, \\rm DMO}$\nrelation, and it does not explain the scatter in $M_{\\rm star} -V_{\\rm max,\nDMO}$. Halo spin, sphericity, triaxiality, substructure and environment are\nalso not responsible for the remaining scatter, which thus could be due to more\ncomplex halo properties or non-linear/stochastic baryonic effects.\n", "  We show that an interferometer moving at a relativistic speed relative to a\npoint source of light offers a sensitive probe of acceleration. Such an\naccelerometer contains no moving parts, and is thus more robust than\nconventional \"mass-on-a-spring\" accelerometers. In an interstellar mission to\nAlpha-Centauri, such an accelerometer could be used to measure the masses of\nplanets around other stars as well as the mass distribution of the Milky Way\nGalaxy.\n", "  Future collider detectors, including silicon tracking detectors planned for\nthe High Luminosity LHC, will require components and mechanical structures\nproviding unprecedented strength-to-mass ratios, thermal conductivity, and\nradiation tolerance. This paper studies carbon foam used in conjunction with\nthermally conductive epoxy and thermally conductive tape for such applications.\nThermal performance and tensile strength measurements of aluminum-carbon\nfoam-adhesive stacks are reported, along with initial radiation damage test\nresults.\n", "  We present sensitive (rms-noises $\\sim$ 4 -- 25 $\\mu$Jy) and high angular\nresolution ($\\sim$1--2$\"$) 8.9 GHz (3.3 cm) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(JVLA) radio continuum observations of 10 presumed transitional disks\nassociated with young low-mass stars. We report the detection of radio\ncontinuum emission in 5 out of the 10 objects (RXJ1615, UX Tau A, LkCa15,\nRXJ1633, and SR24s). In the case of LkCa15, the centimeter emission is\nextended, and has a similar morphology to that of the transitional disk\nobserved at mm wavelengths with an inner depression. For these five detections,\nwe construct the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from the centimeter to\nsubmillimeter wavelengths, and find that they can be well fitted with a single\n(RXJ 1633 and UX Tau A) or a two component power-law (LkCa 15, RXJ 1615, and\nSR24s). For the cases where a single power-law fits well the data, the\ncentimeter emission is likely produced by optically thin dust with large grains\ni.e. centimeter-size pebbles) present in the transitional disks. For the cases\nwhere a double power-law fits the data, the centimeter emission might be\nproduced by the combination of photoevaporation and/or a free-free jet. We\nconclude that RXJ1633 and UX Tau A are excellent examples of transitional disks\nwhere the structure of the emission from centimeter/millimeter pebbles can be\nstudied. In the other cases, some other physical emitting mechanisms are also\nimportant in the centimeter regime.\n", "  We study the impact of stellar feedback in shaping the density and velocity\nstructure of neutral hydrogen (HI) in disc galaxies. For our analysis, we carry\nout $\\sim 4.6$pc resolution $N$-body+adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)\nhydrodynamic simulations of isolated galaxies, set up to mimic a Milky Way\n(MW), and a Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC). We quantify the\ndensity and velocity structure of the interstellar medium using power spectra\nand compare the simulated galaxies to observed HI in local spiral galaxies from\nTHINGS (The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey). Our models with stellar feedback give an\nexcellent match to the observed THINGS HI density power spectra. We find that\nkinetic energy power spectra in feedback regulated galaxies, regardless of\ngalaxy mass and size, show scalings in excellent agreement with super-sonic\nturbulence ($E(k)\\propto k^{-2}$) on scales below the thickness of the HI\nlayer. We show that feedback influences the gas density field, and drives gas\nturbulence, up to large (kpc) scales. This is in stark contrast to density\nfields generated by large scale gravity-only driven turbulence. We conclude\nthat the neutral gas content of galaxies carries signatures of stellar feedback\non all scales.\n", "  In this paper we extend our recent non perturbative functional\nrenormalization group analysis of Reggeon Field Theory to the interactions of\nPomeron and Odderon fields. We establish the existence of a fixed point and its\nuniversal properties, which exhibits a novel symmetry structure in the space of\nOdderon-Pomeron interactions. As in our previous analysis, this part of our\nprogram aims at the investigation of the IR limit of reggeon field theory (the\nlimit of high energies and large transverse distances). It should be seen in\nthe broader context of trying to connect the nonperturbative infrared region\n(large transverse distances) with the UV region of small transverse distances\nwhere the high energy limit of perturbative QCD applies.\n", "  We describe feedhorn-coupled polarization-sensitive detector arrays that\nutilize monocrystalline silicon as the dielectric substrate material.\nMonocrystalline silicon has a low-loss tangent and repeatable dielectric\nconstant, characteristics that are critical for realizing efficient and uniform\nsuperconducting microwave circuits. An additional advantage of this material is\nits low specific heat. In a detector pixel, two Transition-Edge Sensor (TES)\nbolometers are antenna-coupled to in-band radiation via a symmetric planar\northomode transducer (OMT). Each orthogonal linear polarization is coupled to a\nseparate superconducting microstrip transmission line circuit. On-chip\nfiltering is employed to both reject out-of-band radiation from the upper band\nedge to the gap frequency of the niobium superconductor, and to flexibly define\nthe bandwidth for each TES to meet the requirements of the application. The\nmicrowave circuit is compatible with multi-chroic operation. Metalized silicon\nplatelets are used to define the backshort for the waveguide probes. This\nmicro-machined structure is also used to mitigate the coupling of out-of-band\nradiation to the microwave circuit. At 40 GHz, the detectors have a measured\nefficiency of 90%. In this paper, we describe the development of the 90 GHz\ndetector arrays that will be demonstrated using the Cosmology Large Angular\nScale Surveyor (CLASS) ground-based telescope.\n", "  We report on the discovery and timing observations of 29 distant long-period\npulsars discovered in the ongoing Arecibo PALFA pulsar survey. Following\ndiscovery with the Arecibo Telescope, confirmation and timing observations of\nthese pulsars over several years at Jodrell Bank Observatory have yielded\nhigh-precision positions and measurements of rotation and radiation properties.\nWe have used multi-frequency data to measure the interstellar scattering\nproperties of some of these pulsars. Most of the pulsars have properties that\nmirror those of the previously known pulsar population, although four show some\nnotable characteristics. PSRs J1907+0631 and J1925+1720 are young and are\nassociated with supernova remnants or plerionic nebulae: J1907+0631 lies close\nto the center of SNR G40.5-0.5, while J1925+1720 is coincident with a\nhigh-energy Fermi gamma-ray source. One pulsar, J1932+1500, is in a\nsurprisingly eccentric, 199-day binary orbit with a companion having a minimum\nmass of 0.33 solar masses. Several of the sources exhibit timing noise, and\ntwo, PSRs J0611+1436 and J1907+0631, have both suffered large glitches, but\nwith very different post-glitch rotation properties. In particular, the\nrotational period of PSR J0611+1436 will not recover to its pre-glitch value\nfor about 12 years, a far greater recovery timescale than seen following any\nother large glitches.\n", "  Open clusters and young stellar associations are attractive sites to search\nfor planets and to test theories of planet formation, migration, and evolution.\nWe present our search for, and characterization of, transiting planets in the\n~800 Myr old Praesepe (Beehive, M44) Cluster from K2 light curves. We identify\nseven planet candidates, six of which we statistically validate to be real\nplanets, the last of which requires more data. For each host star we obtain\nhigh-resolution NIR spectra to measure its projected rotational broadening and\nradial velocity, the latter of which we use to confirm cluster membership. We\ncombine low-resolution spectra with the known cluster distance and metallicity\nto provide precise temperatures, masses, radii, and luminosities for the host\nstars. Combining our measurements of rotational broadening, rotation periods,\nand our derived stellar radii, we show that all planetary orbits are consistent\nwith alignment to their host star's rotation. We fit the K2 light curves,\nincluding priors on stellar density to put constraints on the planetary\neccentricities, all of which are consistent with zero. The difference between\nthe number of planets found in Praesepe and Hyades (8 planets) and a similar\ndataset for Pleiades (0 planets, ~125 Myr) suggests a trend with age, but may\nbe due to incompleteness of current search pipelines for younger,\nfaster-rotating stars. We see increasing evidence that some planets continue to\nlose atmosphere past 800 Myr, as now two planets at this age have radii\nsignificantly larger than their older counterparts from Kepler.\n", "  Gravitational waves are one of the most important diagnostic tools in the\nanalysis of strong-gravity dynamics and have been turned into an observational\nchannel with LIGO's detection of GW150914. Aside from their importance in\nastrophysics, black holes and compact matter distributions have also assumed a\ncentral role in many other branches of physics. These applications often\ninvolve spacetimes with $D>4$ dimensions where the calculation of gravitational\nwaves is more involved than in the four dimensional case, but has now become\npossible thanks to substantial progress in the theoretical study of general\nrelativity in $D>4$. Here, we develop a numerical implementation of the\nformalism by Godazgar and Reall (Ref.[1]) -- based on projections of the Weyl\ntensor analogous to the Newman-Penrose scalars -- that allows for the\ncalculation of gravitational waves in higher dimensional spacetimes with\nrotational symmetry. We apply and test this method in black-hole head-on\ncollisions from rest in $D=6$ spacetime dimensions and find that a fraction\n$(8.19\\pm 0.05)\\times 10^{-4}$ of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass is radiated\naway from the system, in excellent agreement with literature results based on\nthe Kodama-Ishibashi perturbation technique. The method presented here\ncomplements the perturbative approach by automatically including contributions\nfrom all multipoles rather than computing the energy content of individual\nmultipoles.\n", "  Origami folded cylinders (origami bellows) have found increasingly\nsophisticated applications in space flight and medicine. In spite of this\ninterest, a general understanding of the mechanics of an origami folded\ncylinder has been elusive. With a newly developed set of geometrical tools, we\nhave found an analytic solution for all possible cylindrical rigid-face states\nof both Miura-ori and triangular tessellations. Although an idealized bellows\nin both of these families may have two allowed rigid-face configurations over a\nwell-defined region, the corresponding physical device, limited by nonzero\nmaterial thickness and forced to balance hinge and plate-bending energy, often\ncannot stably maintain a stowed configuration. We have identified the\nparameters that control this emergent bistability, and have demonstrated the\nability to design and fabricate bellows with tunable deployability.\n", "  MICADO will be the first-light wide-field imager for the European Extremely\nLarge Telescope (E-ELT) and will provide difiraction limited imaging (7mas at\n1.2mm) over a ~53 arcsecond field of view. In order to support various\nconsortium activities we have developed a first version of SimCADO: an\ninstrument simulator for MICADO. SimCADO uses the results of the detailed\nsimulation efforts conducted for each of the separate consortium-internal work\npackages in order to generate a model of the optical path from source to\ndetector readout. SimCADO is thus a tool to provide scientific context to both\nthe science and instrument development teams who are ultimately responsible for\nthe final design and future capabilities of the MICADO instrument. Here we\npresent an overview of the inner workings of SimCADO and outline our plan for\nits further development.\n", "  Motivated by the ever increasing pursuit of science with the transient sky\n(dubbed Time Domain Astronomy or TDA), we are fabricating and will commission a\nnew deployable tertiary mirror for the Keck I telescope (K1DM3) at the W.M.\nKeck Observatory. This paper presents the detailed design of K1DM3 with\nemphasis on the opto-mechanics. This project has presented several design\nchallenges. Foremost are the competing requirements to avoid vignetting the\nlight path when retracted against a sufficiently rigid system for\nhigh-precision and repeatable pointing. The design utilizes an actuated swing\narm to retract the mirror or deploy it into a kinematic coupling. The K1DM3\nproject has also required the design and development of custom connections to\nprovide power, communications, and compressed air to the system. This NSF-MRI\nfunded project is planned to be commissioned in Spring 2017.\n", "  In a Galactic core-collapse supernova (SN), axionlike particles (ALPs) could\nbe emitted via the Primakoff process and eventually convert into $\\gamma$ rays\nin the magnetic field of the Milky Way. From a data-driven sensitivity\nestimate, we find that, for a SN exploding in our Galaxy, the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) would be able to explore the photon-ALP coupling down to\n$g_{a\\gamma} \\simeq 2 \\times 10^{-13}\\,$GeV$^{-1}$ for an ALP mass $m_a\n\\lesssim 10^{-9}\\,$eV. These values are out of reach of next generation\nlaboratory experiments. In this event, the Fermi LAT would probe large regions\nof the ALP parameter space invoked to explain the anomalous transparency of the\nUniverse to $\\gamma$ rays, stellar cooling anomalies, and cold dark matter. If\nno $\\gamma$-ray emission were to be detected, Fermi-LAT observations would\nimprove current bounds derived from SN1987A by more than one order of\nmagnitude.\n", "  We present what we believe is the first example of a \"$\\lambda$-line\" phase\ntransition in black hole thermodynamics. This is a line of (continuous) second\norder phase transitions which in the case of liquid $^4$He marks the onset of\nsuperfluidity. The phase transition occurs for a class of asymptotically AdS\nhairy black holes in Lovelock gravity where a real scalar field is conformally\ncoupled to gravity. We discuss the origin of this phase transition and outline\nthe circumstances under which it (or generalizations of it) could occur.\n", "  The doping of semiconductors with magnetic impurities gives rise not only to\na spin-spin interaction between quasi-free carriers and magnetic impurities,\nbut also to a local spin-independent disorder potential for the carriers. Based\non a quantum kinetic theory for the carrier and impurity density matrices as\nwell as the magnetic and non-magnetic carrier-impurity correlations, the\ninfluence of the non-magnetic scattering potential on the spin dynamics in DMS\nafter optical excitation with circularly polarized light is investigated using\nthe example of Mn-doped CdTe. It is shown that non-Markovian effects, which are\npredicted in calculations where only the magnetic carrier-impurity interaction\nis accounted for, can be strongly suppressed in the presence of non-magnetic\nimpurity scattering. This effect can be traced back to a significant\nredistribution of carriers in $\\mathbf{k}$-space which is enabled by the\nbuild-up of large carrier-impurity correlation energies. A comparison with the\nMarkov limit of the quantum kinetic theory shows that, in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field parallel to the initial carrier polarization, the\nasymptotic value of the spin polarization at long times is significantly\ndifferent in the quantum kinetic and the Markovian calculations. This effect\ncan also be attributed to the formation of strong correlations which\ninvalidates the semiclassical Markovian picture and it is stronger when the\nnon-magnetic carrier-impurity interaction is accounted for. In an external\nmagnetic field perpendicular to the initial carrier spin, the correlations are\nalso responsible for a renormalization of the carrier spin precession\nfrequency.\n", "  We study the Bose-Einstein condensation of a finite size pion gas subject to\nthe influence of a magnetic field. We find the expressions for the critical\nchemical potential and temperature for the onset of condensation. We show that\nfor values of the external magnetic flux larger than the elemental flux, the\ncritical temperature is larger than the one obtained by considering only finite\nsize effects. We use experimentally reported values of pion source sizes and\nmultiplicities at LHC energies to show that if the magnetic flux, produced\ninitially in peripheral heavy-ion collision, is at least partially preserved up\nto the hadronic phase, the combined finite size and magnetic field effects give\nrise to a critical temperature above the kinetic freeze-out temperature. We\ndiscuss the implications for the evolution of the pion system created in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The mechanism for acceleration of cosmic rays in supernova remnants (SNRs) is\nan outstanding question in the field. We model a sample of 32 axisymmetric SNRs\nusing the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel cosmic-ray-electron (CRE)\nacceleration cases. The axisymmetric sample is defined to include SNRs with a\ndouble-sided, bilateral morphology, and also those with a one-sided morphology\nwhere one limb is much brighter than the other. Using a coordinate\ntransformation technique, we insert a bubble-like model SNR into a model of the\nGalactic magnetic field. Since radio emission of SNRs is dominated by\nsynchrotron emission and since this emission depends on the magnetic field and\nCRE distribution, we are able to simulate the SNRs emission and compare this to\ndata. We find that the quasi-perpendicular CRE acceleration case is much more\nconsistent with the data than the quasi-parallel CRE acceleration case, with\nG327.6+14.6 (SN1006) being a notable exception. We propose that SN1006 may be a\ncase where both quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular acceleration are\nsimultaneously at play in a single SNR.\n", "  We revisit the old problem of which is the best single particle basis to\nexpress a Hubbard-like lattice model. A rigorous variational solution of this\nproblem leads to equations in which the answer depends in a self-consistent\nmanner on the solution of the lattice model itself. Contrary to naive\nexpectations, for arbitrary small interactions, the optimized orbitals differ\nfrom the non-interacting ones, leading also to substantial changes in the model\nparameters as shown analytically and in an explicit numerical solution for a\nsimple double-well one-dimensional case. At strong coupling, we obtain the\ndirect exchange interaction with a very large renormalization with important\nconsequences for the explanation of ferromagnetism with model hamiltonians.\nMoreover, in the case of two atoms and two fermions we show that the\noptimization equations are closely related to reduced density matrix functional\ntheory thus establishing an unsuspected correspondence between continuum and\nlattice approaches.\n", "  Non-diagonal couplings to a bosonic bath completely change polaronic\ndynamics, from the usual diagonally-coupled paradigm of smoothly-varying\nproperties. We study, using analytic and numerical methods, a model having both\ndiagonal Holstein and non-diagonal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) couplings. The\ncritical coupling found previously in the pure SSH model, at which the $k=0$\neffective mass diverges, now becomes a transition line in the coupling constant\nplane - the form of the line depends on the adiabaticity parameter. Detailed\nresults are given for the quasiparticle and ground state properties, over a\nwide range of couplings and adiabaticity ratios. The new paradigm involves a\ndestabilization, at the transition line, of the simple Holstein polaron to one\nwith a finite ground-state momentum, but with everywhere a continuously\nevolving band shape. No 'self-trapping transition' exists in any of these\nmodels. The physics may be understood entirely in terms of competition between\ndifferent hopping terms in a simple renormalized effective band theory. The\npossibility of further transitions is suggested by the results.\n", "  We analyze the data on cross sections and asymmetries for the $pd (dp) \\to\n\\eta ^3{\\rm He}$ reaction close to threshold and look for bound states of the\n$\\eta ^3 {\\rm He}$ system. Rather than parameterizing the scattering matrix, as\nis usually done, we develop a framework in which the $\\eta ^3 {\\rm He}$ optical\npotential is the key ingredient, and its strength, together with some\nproduction parameters, are fitted to the available experimental data. The\nrelationship of the scattering matrix to the optical potential is established\nusing the Bethe-Salpeter equation and the $\\eta ^3 {\\rm He}$ loop function\nincorporates the range of the interaction given by the empirical $^3 {\\rm He}$\ndensity. We find a local Breit Wigner form of the $\\eta^3$He amplitude $T$\nbelow threshold with a clear peak in $|T|^2$, which corresponds to an $\\eta^3\n{\\rm He}$ binding of about 0.3 MeV and a width of about 3 MeV. By fitting the\npotential we can also evaluate the $\\eta ^3 {\\rm He}$ scattering length,\nincluding its sign, thus resolving the ambiguity in the former analyses.\n", "  The $\\phi$-meson properties in cold nuclear matter are investigated by\nimplementing resonant $\\phi N$ interactions as described in effective\napproaches including the unitarization of scattering amplitudes. Several\n$N^*$-like states are dynamically generated in these models around $2$ GeV, in\nthe vicinity of the $\\phi N$ threshold. We find that both these states and the\nnon-resonant part of the amplitude contribute sizably to the $\\phi$ collisional\nself-energy at finite nuclear density. These contributions are of a similar\nstrength as the widely studied medium effects from the $\\bar K K$ cloud.\nDepending on model details (position of the resonances and strength of the\ncoupling to $\\phi N$) we report a $\\phi$ broadening up to about $40$-$50$ MeV,\nto be added to the $\\phi\\to\\bar K K$ in-medium decay width, and an attractive\noptical potential at threshold up to about $35$ MeV at normal matter density.\nThe $\\phi$ spectral function develops a double peak structure as a consequence\nof the mixing of resonance-hole modes with the $\\phi$ quasi-particle peak. The\nformer results point in the direction of making up for missing absorption as\nreported in $\\phi$ nuclear production experiments.\n", "  In the blooming field of exoplanetary science, NASA's Kepler Space Telescope\nhas revolutionized our understanding of exoplanets. Kepler's very precise and\nlong-duration photometry is ideal for detecting planetary transits around\nSun-like stars. The forthcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is\nexpected to continue Kepler's legacy. Along with transits, the Doppler\ntechnique remains an invaluable tool for discovering planets. The next\ngeneration of spectrographs, such as G-CLEF, promises precision radial velocity\nmeasurements. In this paper, we explore the possibility of detecting planets\naround hypervelocity and runaway stars, which should host a very compact system\nas consequence of their turbulent origin. We find that the probability of a\nmulti-planetary transit is $10^{-3}\\lesssim P\\lesssim 10^{-1}$. We therefore\nneed to observe $\\sim 10-1000$ high-velocity stars to spot a transit. However,\neven if transits are rare around runaway and hypervelocity stars, the chances\nof detecting such planets using radial velocity surveys is high. We predict\nthat the European Gaia satellite, along with TESS and the new-generation\nspectrographs G-CLEF and ESPRESSO, will spot planetary systems orbiting\nhigh-velocity stars.\n", "  The convergence of a recently proposed coupled cluster (CC) family of\nperturbation series [Eriksen, J. J. et al., J. Chem. Phys. 140, 064108 (2014)],\nin which the energetic difference between two CC models - a low-level parent\nand a high-level target model - is expanded in orders of the M{\\o}ller-Plesset\n(MP) fluctuation potential, is investigated for four prototypical closed-shell\nsystems (Ne, singlet methylene, distorted HF, and the fluoride anion) in\nstandard and augmented basis sets. In these investigations, energy corrections\nof the various series have been calculated to high orders and their convergence\nradii determined by probing for possible front- and back-door intruder states,\nthe existence of which would make the series divergent. In summary, we conclude\nhow it is primarily the choice of target state, and not the choice of parent\nstate, which ultimately governs the convergence behavior of a given series. For\nexample, restricting the target state to, say, triple or quadruple excitations\nmight remove intruders present in series that target the full configuration\ninteraction (FCI) limit, such as the standard MP series. Furthermore, we find\nthat whereas a CC perturbation series might converge within standard\ncorrelation consistent basis sets, it may start to diverge whenever these\nbecome augmented by diffuse functions, similar to the MP case. However, unlike\nfor the MP case, such potential divergences are not found to invalidate the\npractical use of the low-order corrections of the CC perturbation series.\n", "  Any recipe to grow black hole hair has to circumvent no-hair theorems by\nviolating some of their assumptions. Recently discovered hairy black hole\nsolutions exist due to the fact that their scalar fields don't inherit the\nsymmetries of the spacetime metric. We present here a general analysis of the\nconstraints which limit the possible forms of such a hair, for both the real\nand the complex scalar fields. These results can be taken as a novel piece of\nthe black hole uniqueness theorems or simply as a symmetry noninheriting\nAns\\\"atze guide. In addition we introduce new classification of the\ngravitational field equations which might prove useful for various\ngeneralizations of the theorems about spacetimes with symmetries.\n", "  We present the results of the Gould's Belt Distances Survey (GOBELINS) of\nyoung star forming regions towards the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. We\ndetected 36 YSOs with the Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA), 27 of which have\nbeen observed in at least 3 epochs over the course of 2 years. At least half of\nthese YSOs belong to multiple systems. We obtained parallax and proper motions\ntowards these stars to study the structure and kinematics of the Complex. We\nmeasured a distance of 388$\\pm$5 pc towards the Orion Nebula Cluster,\n428$\\pm$10 pc towards the southern portion L1641, 388$\\pm$10 pc towards NGC\n2068, and roughly $\\sim$420 pc towards NGC 2024. Finally, we observed a strong\ndegree of plasma radio scattering towards $\\lambda$ Ori.\n", "  We present late-time optical spectroscopy taken with the Large Binocular\nTelescope's Multi-Object Double Spectrograph, late-time SWIFT UVOT and XRT\nobservations, as well as improved ASAS-SN pre-discovery limits on the nearby\n(d=90.3 Mpc, z=0.0206) tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. The late-time\noptical spectra show H$\\alpha$ emission well in excess of that seen in the SDSS\nhost galaxy spectrum, indicating that the processes powering the luminous\nflares associated with TDEs can operate for several hundreds of days. The SWIFT\nobservations reveal the presence of lingering apparently thermal UV (T$_{\\rm\nUV} \\sim 3.5\\times10^4$ K) and X-ray (T$_{\\rm X} \\sim 7\\times10^5$ K) emission.\nThe characteristic temperatures evolve by, at most, a factor of $\\sim2$ over\nthe 600 day follow-up campaign. The X-ray, UV, and H$\\alpha$ luminosities\nevolve roughly in tandem and at a rate that is consistent with a power-law\ndecay at late times. This behavior is in stark contrast with the majority of\noptically discovered TDEs, which are X-ray faint and evolve on shorter\ntimescales. Finally we address how the unique properties of ASASSN-14li can be\nused to probe the relationship between the TDE rate and host galaxy properties.\n", "  BHR 160 is a virtually unstudied cometary globule within the Sco OB4\nassociation in Scorpius at a distance of 1600pc. It is part of a system of\ncometary clouds which face the luminous O star HD155806. BHR 160 is special\nbecause it has an intense bright rim. We attempt to derive physical parameters\nfor BHR 160 and to understand its structure and the origin of its peculiar\nbright rim. BHR 160 was mapped in the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1)\nand (1-0) and CS (3-2) and (2-1) lines. These data, augmented with stellar\nphotometry derived from the ESO VVV survey, were used to derive the mass and\ndistribution of molecular material in BHR 160 and its surroundings. Archival\nmid-infrared data from the WISE satellite was used to find IR excess stars in\nthe globule and its neighbourhood. An elongated 1' by 0.6' core lies adjacent\nto the globule bright rim. $^{12}$CO emission covers the whole globule, but the\n$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and CS emission is more concentrated to the core. The\n$^{12}$CO line profiles indicate the presence of outflowing material near the\ncore, but the spatial resolution of the mm data is not sufficient for a\ndetailed spatial analysis. The BHR 160 mass estimated from the C$^{18}$O\nmapping is 100$\\pm$50Msun(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ where d is the distance to the globule.\nApproximately 70 percent of the mass lies in the dense core. The total mass of\nmolecular gas in the direction of BHR 160 is 210$\\pm$(d/1.6kpc)$^2$ Msun when\nestimated from the more extended VVV NIR photometry. We argue that the bright\nrim of BHR 160 is produced by a close-by early B-type star, HD 319648, that was\nlikely recently born in the globule. This star is likely to have triggered the\nformation of a source, IRS 1, that is embedded within the core of the globule\nand detected only in Ks and by WISE and IRAS.\n", "  We consider scenarios in which the annihilation of self-conjugate spin-1 dark\nmatter to a Standard Model fermion-antifermion final state is chirality\nsuppressed, but where this suppression can be lifted by the emission of an\nadditional photon via internal bremsstrahlung. We find that this scenario can\nonly arise if the initial dark matter state is polarized, which can occur in\nthe context of self-interacting dark matter. In particular, this is possible if\nthe dark matter pair forms a bound state that decays to its ground state before\nthe constituents annihilate. We show that the shape of the resulting photon\nspectrum is the same as for self-conjugate spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter, but\nthe normalization is less heavily suppressed in the limit of heavy mediators.\n", "  Optical singularities manifesting at the center of vector vortex beams are\nunstable, since their topological charge is higher than the lowest value\npermitted by Maxwell's equations. Inspired by conceptually similar phenomena\noccurring in the polarization pattern characterizing the skylight, we show how\nperturbations that break the symmetry of radially symmetric vector beams lead\nto the formation of a pair of fundamental and stable singularities, i.e. points\nof circular polarization. We prepare a superposition of a radial (or azimuthal)\nvector beam and a uniformly linearly polarized Gaussian beam; by varying the\namplitudes of the two fields, we control the formation of pairs of these\nsingular points and their spatial separation. We complete this study by\napplying the same analysis to vector vortex beams with higher topological\ncharges, and by investigating the features that arise when increasing the\nintensity of the Gaussian term. Our results can find application in the context\nof singularimetry, where weak fields are measured by considering them as\nperturbation of unstable optical beams.\n", "  In modern high precision optical instruments, such as in gravitational wave\ndetectors or frequency references, thermally induced fluctuations in the\nreflective coatings can be a limiting noise source. This noise, known as\ncoating thermal noise, can be reduced by choosing materials with low mechanical\nloss. Examination of new materials becomes a necessity in order to further\nminimize the coating thermal noise and thus improve sensitivity of next\ngeneration instruments. We present a novel approach to directly measure coating\nthermal noise using a high finesse folded cavity in which multiple\nHermite-Gaussian modes co-resonate. This method is used to probe surface\nfluctuations on the order 10^-17 m\\rtHz in the frequency range 30-400 Hz. We\napplied this technique to measure thermal noise and loss angle of the coating\nused in Advanced LIGO.\n", "  We present the CAlibrating LYMan-$\\alpha$ with H$\\alpha$ (CALYMHA) pilot\nsurvey and new results on Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) selected galaxies at z~2. We use\na custom-built Lya narrow-band filter at the Isaac Newton Telescope, designed\nto provide a matched volume coverage to the z=2.23 Ha HiZELS survey. Here we\npresent the first results for the COSMOS and UDS fields. Our survey currently\nreaches a 3$\\sigma$ line flux limit of ~4x10$^{-17}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$, and a Lya\nluminosity limit of ~10$^{42.3}$ erg/s. We find 188 Lya emitters over\n7.3x10$^5$ Mpc$^{3}$, but also find significant numbers of other line emitting\nsources corresponding to HeII, CIII] and CIV emission lines. These sources are\nimportant contaminants, and we carefully remove them, unlike most previous\nstudies. We find that the Lya luminosity function at z=2.23 is very well\ndescribed by a Schechter function up to L~10$^{43}$ erg/s with\nL$^*=10^{42.59+-0.05}$ erg/s, $\\phi^*=10^{-3.09+-0.08}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and\n$\\alpha$=-1.75+-0.15. Above L~10$^{43}$ erg/s the Lya luminosity function\nbecomes power-law like, driven by X-ray AGN. We find that Lya-selected emitters\nhave a high escape fraction of 37+-7%, anti-correlated with Lya luminosity and\ncorrelated with Lya equivalent width. Lya emitters have ubiquitous large (~40\nkpc) Lya haloes, 2x larger than their Ha extents. By directly comparing our Lya\nand Ha luminosity functions we find that the global/overall escape fraction of\nLya photons (within a 13 kpc radius) from the full population of star-forming\ngalaxies is 5.1+-0.2% at the peak of the star formation history. An extra\n3.3+-0.3% of Lya photons likely still escape, but at larger radii.\n", "  We study the correlation between far-infared/submm dust emission and atomic\ngas column density in order to derive the properties of the high Galactic\nlatitude, low density, Milky Way cirrus in the foreground of the Virgo cluster\nof galaxies. Dust emission maps from 60 to 850 um are obtained from SPIRE\nobservations carried out within the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey, complemented\nby IRAS-IRIS and Planck-HFI maps. Data from the Arecibo legacy Fast ALFA Survey\nis used to derive atomic gas column densities for two broad velocity\ncomponents, low and intermediate velocity clouds. Dust emissivities are derived\nfor each gas component and each far-infared/submm band. For the low velocity\nclouds, we measure an average emissivity 0.79 +/- 0.08 times 1E-20 MJy sr^-1\ncm^2 at 250 um. After fitting a modified blackbody to the available bands, we\nestimated a dust absorption cross-section 0.49 +/- 0.13 times 1E-25 cm^2 H^-1\nat 250 um (with dust temperature T = 20.4 +/- 1.5 K and spectral index beta =\n1.53 +/- 0.17). The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by\nPlanck over a much larger coverage of the high Galactic latitude cirrus (50% of\nthe sky vs 0.2% in our work). For dust associated with intermediate velocity\ngas, we confirm earlier Planck results and find a higher temperature and lower\nemissivity and cross-section. After subtracting the modelled components, we\nfind regions at scales smaller than 20' where the residuals deviate\nsignificantly from the average, cosmic-infrared-background dominated, scatter.\nThese large residuals are most likely due to local variations in the cirrus\ndust properties (and/or the dust/atomic-gas correlation) or to high-latitude\nmolecular clouds with average N_H2 <~ 1E20 cm^-2. We find no conclusive\nevidence for intracluster dust emission in Virgo.\n", "  We carry out an ALMA $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) and 1.3~mm continuum survey towards 32\nhigh mass surface density regions in seven Infrared Dark Clouds with the aim of\nfinding massive starless cores, which may be the initial conditions for the\nformation of massive stars. Cores showing strong $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) emission are\nexpected to be highly deuterated and indicative of early, potentially\npre-stellar stages of star formation. We also present maps of these regions in\nancillary line tracers, including C$^{18}$O(2-1), DCN(3-2) and DCO$^+$(3-2).\nOver 100 $\\rm N_2D^+$ cores are identified with our newly developed\ncore-finding algorithm based on connected structures in position-velocity\nspace. The most massive core has $\\sim70\\:M_\\odot$ (potentially\n$\\sim170\\:M_\\odot$) and so may be representative of the initial conditions for\nmassive star formation. The existence and dynamical properties of such cores\nconstrain massive star formation theories. We measure the line widths and thus\nvelocity dispersion of six of the cores with strongest $\\rm N_2D^+$(3-2) line\nemission, finding results that are generally consistent with virial equilibrium\nof pressure confined cores.\n", "  The Zadko Telescope is a 1 m f/4 Cassegrain telescope, situated in the state\nof Western Australia about 80 km north of Perth. The facility plays a niche\nrole in Australian astronomy, as it is the only meter class facility in\nAustralia dedicated to automated follow-up imaging of alerts or triggers\nreceived from different external instruments/detectors spanning the entire\nelectromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore the location of the facility at a\nlongitude not covered by other meter class facilities provides an important\nresource for time critical projects. This paper reviews the status of the Zadko\nfacility and science projects since it began robotic operations in March 2010.\nWe report on major upgrades to the infrastructure and equipment (2012-2014)\nthat has resulted in significantly improved robotic operations. Secondly, we\nreview the core science projects, which include automated rapid follow-up of\ngamma ray burst (GRB) optical afterglows, imaging of neutrino counterpart\ncandidates from the ANTARES neutrino observatory, photometry of rare\n(Barbarian) asteroids, supernovae searches in nearby galaxies. Finally, we\ndiscuss participation in newly commencing international projects, including the\noptical follow-up of gravitational wave candidates from the U.S. and European\ngravitational wave observatory network, and present first tests for very low\nlatency follow-up of fast radio bursts. In the context of these projects, we\noutline plans for a future upgrade that will optimise the facility for alert\ntriggered imaging from the radio, optical, high-energy, neutrino and\ngravitational wave bands.\n", "  We present the first study of the isotropy of the distribution of\nmorphological types of galaxies in the Local Universe out to around 200 Mpc\nusing more than 60,000 galaxies from the HyperLeda database. We divide the sky\ninto two opposite hemispheres and compare the abundance distribution of the\nmorphological types, $T$, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This is\nrepeated for different directions in the sky and the KS statistic as a function\nof sky coordinates is obtained. For three samples of galaxies within around\n100, 150, and 200 Mpc, we find a significant hemispherical asymmetry with a\nvanishingly small chance of occurring in an isotropic distribution.\nAstonishingly, regardless of this extreme significance, the hemispherical\nasymmetry is aligned with the Celestial Equator at the 97.1-99.8% and with the\nEcliptic at the 94.6-97.6% confidence levels, estimated using a Monte Carlo\nanalysis. Shifting $T$ values randomly within their uncertainties has a\nnegligible effect on this result. When a magnitude limit of $B\\leq 15$ mag is\napplied, the sample within 100 Mpc shows no significant anisotropy after random\nshifting of $T$. However, the direction of the asymmetry in the samples within\n150 and 200 Mpc and $B\\leq 15$ mag is found to be within an angular separation\nof 32 degrees from $(l,b)=(123.7, 24.6)$ with 97.2% and 99.9% confidence\nlevels, respectively. This direction is only 2.6 degrees away from the\nCelestial North Pole. Unless the Local Universe has a significant anisotropic\ndistribution of galaxy types aligned with the orientation or the orbit of the\nEarth (which would be a challenge for the Cosmological Principle), our results\nshow that there seems to be a systematic bias in the classification of galaxy\nmorphological types between the data from the Northern and the Southern\nEquatorial sky. Further studies are absolutely needed to find out the exact\nsource of this anisotropy.\n", "  We compared the properties of 56 elliptical galaxies selected from three\nclusters at $1.2<z<1.4$ with those of field galaxies in the GOODS-S (~30),\nCOSMOS (~180) and CANDELS (~220) fields. We studied the relationships among\neffective radius, surface brightness, stellar mass, stellar mass density\n$\\Sigma_{Re}$ and central mass density $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ within 1 kpc radius. We\nfind that cluster ellipticals do not differ from field ellipticals: they share\nthe same structural parameters at fixed mass and the same scaling relations. On\nthe other hand, the population of field ellipticals at $z\\sim1.3$ shows a\nsignificant lack of massive ($M_*> 2\\times 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$) and large (R$_e\n> 4-5$ kpc) ellipticals with respect to the cluster. Nonetheless, at\n$M*<2\\times 10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$, the two populations are similar. The size-mass\nrelation of ellipticals at z~1.3 defines two different regimes, above and below\na transition mass $m_t\\sim 2-3\\times10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$: at lower masses the\nrelation is nearly flat (R$_e\\propto M_*^{-0.1\\pm 0.2}$), the mean radius is\nconstant at ~1 kpc and $\\Sigma_{Re}\\sim \\Sigma_{1kpc}$ while, at larger masses,\nthe relation is R$_e\\propto M*^{0.64\\pm0.09}$. The transition mass marks the\nmass at which galaxies reach the maximum $\\Sigma_{Re}$. Also the\n$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$-mass relation follows two different regimes,\n$\\Sigma_{1kpc}\\propto M*^{0.64\\ >m_t}_{1.07\\ <m_t}$, defining a transition mass\ndensity $\\Sigma_{1kpc}\\sim 2-3\\times10^3$ M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$. The mass density\n$\\Sigma_{Re}$ does not correlate with mass, dense/compact galaxies can be\nassembled over a wide mass regime, independently of the environment. The\ncentral mass density, $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$, besides to be correlated with the mass,\nis correlated to the age of the stellar population: the higher the central\nstellar mass density, the higher the mass, the older the age of the stellar\npopulation. [Abridged]\n", "  Previous work on protoplanetary dust growth shows halt at centimeter sizes\nowing to the occurrence of bouncing at velocities of $\\geq$ 0.1 $ms^{-1}$ and\nfragmentation at velocities $\\geq$ 1 $ms^{-1}$. To overcome these barriers,\nspatial concentration of cm-sized dust pebbles and subsequent gravitational\ncollapse have been proposed. However, numerical investigations have shown that\ndust aggregates may undergo fragmentation during the gravitational collapse\nphase. This fragmentation in turn changes the size distribution of the solids\nand thus must be taken into account in order to understand the properties of\nthe planetesimals that form. To explore the fate of dust pebbles undergoing\nfragmenting collisions, we conducted laboratory experiments on dust-aggregate\ncollisions with a focus on establishing a collision model for this stage of\nplanetesimal formation. In our experiments, we analysed collisions of dust\naggregates with masses between 1.4 g and 180 g, mass ratios between target and\nprojectile from 125 to 1 at a fixed porosity of 65%, within the velocity range\nof 1.5 $-$ 8.7 $ms^{-1}$ , at low atmospheric pressure of $\\sim 10^{-3}$ mbar\nand in free-fall conditions. We derived the mass of the largest fragment, the\nfragment size/mass distribution, and the efficiency of mass transfer as a\nfunction of collision velocity and projectile/target aggregate size. Moreover,\nwe give recipes for an easy-to-use fragmentation and mass-transfer model for\nfurther use in modeling work. In a companion paper, we utilize the experimental\nfindings and the derived dust-aggregate collision model to investigate the fate\nof dust pebbles during gravitational collapse.\n", "  Various intermetallic compounds harbor subtle electronic correlation effects.\nTo elucidate this fact for the Fe-Al system, we perform a realistic many-body\ninvestigation based on the combination of density functional theory with\ndynamical mean-field theory in a charge self-consistent manner. A better\ncharacterization and understanding of the phase stability of bcc-based\nD0$_3$-Fe$_3$Al through an improved description of the correlated charge\ndensity and the magnetic-energy is achevied. Upon replacement of one Fe\nsublattice by V, the Heusler compound Fe$_2$VAl is realized, known to display\nbad-metal behavior and increased specific heat. We here document a charge-gap\nopening at low temperatures in line with previous experimental work. The gap\nstructure does not match conventional band theory and is reminiscent of\n(pseudo)gap charateristics in correlated oxides.\n", "  We investigate both analytically and by computer simulations the ensemble\naveraged, time averaged, non-ergodic, and ageing properties of massive\nparticles diffusing in a medium with a time dependent diffusivity. We call this\nstochastic diffusion process the (ageing) underdamped scaled Brownian motion\n(UDSBM). We demonstrate how the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the time\naveraged MSD of UDSBM are affected by the inertial term in the Langevin\nequation, both at short, intermediate, and even long diffusion times. In\nparticular, we quantify the ballistic regime for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD as well as the spread of individual time averaged MSD trajectories. One of\nthe main effects we observe is that---both for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD---for superdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic regime is much shorter than for\nordinary Brownian motion. In contrast, for subdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic\nregion extends to much longer diffusion times. Therefore, particular care needs\nto be taken when the overdamped limit indeed provides a correct description,\neven in the long time limit. We also analyze to what extent ergodicity in the\nBoltzmann-Khinchin sense in this non-stationary system is broken, both for\nsubdiffusive and superdiffusive UDSBM. Finally, the limiting case of ultraslow\nUDSBM is considered, with a mixed logarithmic and power law dependence of the\nensemble and time averaged MSDs of the particles. In the limit of strong\nageing, remarkably, the ordinary UDSBM and the ultraslow UDSBM behave similarly\nin the short time ballistic limit. The approaches developed here open new ways\nfor considering other stochastic processes under physically important\nconditions when a finite particle mass and ageing in the system cannot be\nneglected.\n", "  It has been suggested that single and double jets observed emanating from\ncertain astrophysical objects may have a purely gravitational origin. We\ndiscuss new classes of plane-fronted and pulsed gravitational wave solutions to\nthe equation for perturbations of Ricci-flat spacetimes around Minkowski\nmetrics, as models for the genesis of such phenomena. These solutions are\nclassified in terms of their chirality and generate a family of non-stationary\nspacetime metrics. Particular members of these families are used as backgrounds\nin analysing time-like solutions to the geodesic equation for test particles.\nThey are found numerically to exhibit both single and double jet-like features\nwith dimensionless aspect ratios suggesting that it may be profitable to\ninclude such backgrounds in simulations of astrophysical jet dynamics from\nrotating accretion discs involving electromagnetic fields.\n", "  Tidal Downsizing is the modern version of the Kuiper (1951) scenario of\nplanet formation. Detailed simulations of self-gravitating discs, gas\nfragments, dust grain dynamics, and planet evolutionary calculations are\nsummarised here and used to build a predictive planet formation model and\npopulation synthesis. A new interpretation of exoplanetary and debris disc\ndata, the Solar System's origins, and the links between planets and brown\ndwarfs is offered. This interpretation is contrasted with the current\nobservations and the predictions of the Core Accretion theory. Observations\nthat can distinguish the two scenarios are pointed out. In particular, Tidal\nDownsizing predicts that presence of debris discs, sub-Neptune mass planets,\nplanets more massive than $\\sim 5$~Jupiter masses and brown dwarfs should not\ncorrelate strongly with the metallicity of the host. For gas giants of $\\sim$\nSaturn to a few Jupiter mass, a strong host star metallicity correlation is\npredicted only inwards of a few AU from the host. Composition of massive cores\nis predicted to be dominated by rock rather than ices. Debris discs made by\nTidal Downsizing are distinct from those made by Core Accretion at birth: they\nhave an innermost edge always larger than about 1 au, have smaller total masses\nand are usually in a dynamically excited state. It is argued that planet\nformation in surprisingly young or very dynamic systems such as HL Tau and\nKepler-444 may be a signature of Tidal Downsizing. Open questions and potential\nweaknesses of the hypothesis are pointed out.\n", "  An inclusive search for supersymmetry using razor variables is performed in\nevents with four or more jets and no more than one lepton. The results are\nbased on a sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS experiment at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. No significant excess over the\nbackground prediction is observed in data, and 95% confidence level exclusion\nlimits are placed on the masses of new heavy particles in a variety of\nsimplified models. Assuming that pair-produced gluinos decay only via\nthree-body processes involving third-generation quarks plus a neutralino, and\nthat the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle with a mass of 200\nGeV, gluino masses below 1.6 TeV are excluded for any branching fractions for\nthe individual gluino decay modes. For some specific decay mode scenarios,\ngluino masses up to 1.65 TeV are excluded. For decays to first- and\nsecond-generation quarks and a neutralino with a mass of 200 GeV, gluinos with\nmasses up to 1.4 TeV are excluded. Pair production of top squarks decaying to a\ntop quark and a neutralino with a mass of 100 GeV is excluded for top squark\nmasses up to 750 GeV.\n", "  We present analytical and numerical investigation of spectral and transport\nproperties of a quadruple quantum-dot (QQD) structure which is one of the\npopular low-dimensional systems in the context of fundamental quantum physics\nstudy, future electronic applications and quantum calculations. The density of\nstates, occupation numbers and conductance of the structure were analyzed using\nthe nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight binding approach and the\nequation-of-motion method. In particular the anisotropy of hopping integrals\nand on-site electron energies as well as the effects of the finite intra- and\ninterdot Coulomb interactions were investigated. It was found out that the\nanisotropy of the kinetic processes in the system leads to the Fano-Feshbach\nasymmetrical peak. We demonstrated that the conductance of QQD device has a\nwide insulating band with steep edges separating triple-peak structures if the\nintradot Coulomb interactions are taken into account. The interdot Coulomb\ncorrelations between the central QDs result in the broadening of this band and\nthe occurrence of an additional band with low conductance due to the Fano\nantiresonances. It was shown that in this case the conductance of the\nanisotropic QQD device can be dramatically changed by tuning the anisotropy of\non-site electron energies.\n", "  The electric dipole moment of an electron (eEDM) is one of the sensitive\nprobes of physics beyond the standard model. The possible existence of the eEDM\ngives rise to an experimentally observed energy shift, which is proportional to\nthe effective electric field (Eeff) of a target molecule. Hence, an analysis of\nthe quantities that enhance Eeff is necessary to identify suitable molecules\nfor eEDM searches. In the context of such searches, it is generally believed\nthat a molecule with larger electric polarization also has a larger value of\nEeff. However, our Dirac-Fock and relativistic coupled-cluster singles and\ndoubles calculations show that the hydrides of Yb and Hg have larger Eeff than\nthose of fluorides, even though their polarizations are smaller. This is due to\nsignificant mixing of valence s and p orbitals of the heavy atom in the\nmolecules. This mixing has been attributed to the energy differences of the\nvalence atomic orbitals and the overlap of the two atomic orbitals based on the\norbital interaction theory.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a novel topological spintronic\nphenomenon arising from inherent magnetization and spin-orbit coupling. Various\ntheoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted in search of robust\nintrinsic QAH insulators. However, up to now, it has only been observed in Cr\nor V doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 film in experiments with very low working temperature.\nBased on the successful synthesis of transition metal halides, we use\nfirst-principles calculations to predict that RuI3 monolayer is an intrinsic\nferromagnetic QAH insulator with a topologically nontrivial global band gap of\n11 meV. This topologically nontrivial band gap at the Fermi level is due to its\ncrystal symmetry, thus the QAH effect is robust. Its Curie temperature,\nestimated to be ~360 K using Monte-Carlo simulation, is above room temperature\nand higher than most of two-dimensional ferromagnetic thin films. We also\ndiscuss the manipulation of its exchange energy and nontrivial band gap by\napplying in-plane strain. Our work adds a new experimentally feasible member to\nthe QAH insulator family, which is expected to have broad applications in\nnanoelectronics and spintronics.\n", "  We perform the first magnetohydrodynamical simulations of tidal disruptions\nof stars by supermassive black holes. We consider stars with both tangled and\nordered magnetic fields, for both grazing and deeply disruptive encounters.\nWhen the star survives disruption, we find its magnetic field amplifies by a\nfactor of up to twenty, but see no evidence for the a self-sustaining dynamo\nthat would yield arbitrary field growth. For stars that do not survive, and\nwithin the tidal debris streams produced in partial disruptions, we find that\nthe component of the magnetic field parallel to the direction of stretching\nalong the debris stream only decreases slightly with time, eventually resulting\nin a stream where the magnetic pressure is in equipartition with the gas. Our\nresults suggest that the returning gas in most (if not all) stellar tidal\ndisruptions is already highly magnetized by the time it returns to the black\nhole.\n", "  Electron transport in small graphene nanoribbons is studied by microwave\nemulation experiments and tight-binding calculations. In particular, it is\ninvestigated under which conditions a transport gap can be observed. Our\nexperiments provide evidence that armchair ribbons of width $3m+2$ with integer\n$m$ are metallic and otherwise semiconducting, whereas zigzag ribbons are\nmetallic independent of their width. The contact geometry, defining to which\natoms at the ribbon edges the source and drain leads are attached, has strong\neffects on the transport. If leads are attached only to the inner atoms of\nzigzag edges, broad transport gaps can be observed in all armchair ribbons as\nwell as in rhomboid-shaped zigzag ribbons. All experimental results agree\nqualitatively with tight-binding calculations using the nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction method.\n", "  We report on numerically exact determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations\nof the onset of spin-density wave (SDW) order in itinerant electron systems\ncaptured by a sign-problem-free two-dimensional lattice model. Extensive\nmeasurements of the SDW correlations in the vicinity of the phase transition\nreveal that the critical dynamics of the bosonic order parameter are well\ndescribed by a dynamical critical exponent z = 2, consistent with Hertz-Millis\ntheory, but are found to follow a finite-temperature dependence that does not\nfit the predicted behavior of the same theory. The presence of critical SDW\nfluctuations is found to have a strong impact on the fermionic quasiparticles,\ngiving rise to a dome-shaped superconducting phase near the quantum critical\npoint. In the superconducting state we find a gap function that has an opposite\nsign between the two bands of the model and is nearly constant along the Fermi\nsurface of each band. Above the superconducting $T_c$ our numerical simulations\nreveal a nearly temperature and frequency independent self energy causing a\nstrong suppression of the low-energy quasiparticle spectral weight in the\nvicinity of the hot spots on the Fermi surface. This indicates a clear\nbreakdown of Fermi liquid theory around these points.\n", "  The Pluto-Charon system has come into sharper focus following the fly by of\nNew Horizons. We use N-body simulations to probe the unique dynamical history\nof this binary dwarf planet system. We follow the evolution of the debris disc\nthat might have formed during the Charon-forming giant impact. First, we note\nthat in-situ formation of the four circumbinary moons is extremely difficult if\nCharon undergoes eccentric tidal evolution. We track collisions of disc debris\nwith Charon, estimating that hundreds to hundreds of thousands of visible\ncraters might arise from 0.3--5 km radius bodies. New Horizons data suggesting\na dearth of these small craters may place constraints on the disc properties.\nWhile tidal heating will erase some of the cratering history, both tidal and\nradiogenic heating may also make it possible to differentiate disc debris\ncraters from Kuiper belt object craters. We also track the debris ejected from\nthe Pluto-Charon system into the Solar System; while most of this debris is\nultimately lost from the Solar System, a few tens of 10--30 km radius bodies\ncould survive as a Pluto-Charon collisional family. Most are plutinos in the\n3:2 resonance with Neptune, while a small number populate nearby resonances. We\nshow that migration of the giant planets early in the Solar System's history\nwould not destroy this collisional family. Finally, we suggest that\nidentification of such a family would likely need to be based on composition as\nthey show minimal clustering in relevant orbital parameters.\n", "  We present new measurements of the power spectra of the cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB) anisotropies using the Planck 2015 full-mission HFI data at\n353, 545, and 857 GHz over 20000 square degrees. We use techniques similar to\nthose applied for the cosmological analysis of Planck, subtracting dust\nemission at the power spectrum level. Our analysis gives stable solutions for\nthe CIB power spectra with increasing sky coverage up to about 50% of the sky.\nThese spectra agree well with Hi cleaned spectra from Planck measured on much\nsmaller areas of sky with low Galactic dust emission. At 545 and 857 GHz our\nCIB spectra agree well with those measured from Herschel data. We find that the\nCIB spectra at l > 500 are well fitted by a power-law model for the clustered\nCIB, with a shallow index {\\gamma}^cib = 0.53\\pm0.02. This is consistent with\nthe CIB results at 217 GHz from the cosmological parameter analysis of Planck.\nWe show that a linear combination of the 545 and 857 GHz Planck maps is\ndominated by CIB fluctuations at multipoles l > 300.\n", "  We calculate the zero-temperature differential conductance $dI/dV$ of a\nvoltage-biased one-dimensional junction between a nontopological and a\ntopological superconductor for arbitrary junction transparency using the\nscattering matrix formalism. We consider two representative models for the\ntopological superconductors: (i) spinful $p$-wave and (ii) $s$-wave with\nspin-orbit coupling and spin splitting. We verify that in the tunneling limit\n(small junction transparencies) where only single Andreev reflections\ncontribute to the current, the conductance for voltages below the\nnontopological superconductor gap $\\Delta_s$ is zero and there are two\nsymmetric conductance peaks appearing at $eV = \\pm \\Delta_s$ with the quantized\nvalue $(4-\\pi)2e^2/h$ due to resonant Andreev reflection from the Majorana zero\nmode. However, when the junction transparency is not small, there is a finite\nconductance for $e|V| < \\Delta_s$ arising from multiple Andreev reflections.\nThe conductance at $eV = \\pm \\Delta_s$ in this case is no longer quantized. In\ngeneral, the conductance is particle-hole asymmetric except for sufficiently\nsmall transparencies. We further show that, for certain values of parameters,\nthe tunneling conductance from a zero-energy conventional Andreev bound state\ncan be made to mimic the conductance from a true Majorana mode.\n", "  We here report a detailed high-pressure infrared transmission study of BiTeCl\nand BiTeBr. We follow the evolution of two band transitions: the optical\nexcitation $\\beta$ between two Rashba-split conduction bands, and the\nabsorption $\\gamma$ across the band gap. In the low pressure range, $p< 4$~GPa,\nfor both compounds $\\beta$ is approximately constant with pressure and $\\gamma$\ndecreases, in agreement with band structure calculations. In BiTeCl, a clear\npressure-induced phase transition at 6~GPa leads to a different ground state.\nFor BiTeBr, the pressure evolution is more subtle, and we discuss the\npossibility of closing and reopening of the band gap. Our data is consistent\nwith a Weyl phase in BiTeBr at 5$-$6~GPa, followed by the onset of a structural\nphase transition at 7~GPa.\n", "  We analyse the Transit Timing Variation (TTV) measurements of a~system of two\nsuper-Earths detected as Kepler-29, in order to constrain the planets' masses\nand orbital parameters. A dynamical analysis of the best-fitting configurations\nconstrains the masses to be $\\sim 6$ and $\\sim 5$ Earth masses for the inner\nand the outer planets, respectively. The analysis also reveals that the system\nis likely locked in the 9:7~mean motion resonance. However, a variety of\norbital architectures regarding eccentricities and the relative orientation of\norbits is permitted by the observations as well as by stability constraints. We\nattempt to find configurations preferred by the planet formation scenarios as\nan additional, physical constraint. We show that configurations with low\neccentricities and anti-aligned apsidal lines of the orbits are a natural and\nmost likely outcome of the convergent migration. However, we show that\nlibrations of the critical angles are not necessary for the Kepler-29 system to\nbe dynamically resonant, and such configurations may be formed on the way of\nmigration as well. We argue, on the other hand, that aligned configurations\nwith $e \\gtrsim 0.03$ may be not consistent with the migration scenario.\n", "  In pulsed magnetic fields up to 65T and at temperatures below the N\\'eel\ntransition, our magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal a\nfield-induced metamagnetic-like transition that is suggestive of an\nantiferromagnetic to polarized paramagnetic or ferrimagnetic ordering. Our data\nalso suggests a change in the nature of this metamagnetic-like transition from\nsecond- to first-order-like near a tricritical point at T_{tc} ~145K and\nH_{c}~52T. At high fields for H>H_{c} we found a decreased magnetic moment\nroughly half of the moment reported in low field measurements. We propose that\n\\mathit{f-p} hybridization effects and magnetoelastic interactions drive the\ndecreased moment, lack of saturation at high fields, and the decreased phase\nboundary.\n", "  This study is a contribution in comprehending the role of binarity upon late\nstages of stellar evolution. We determine the binary status of six Galactic RV\nTauri stars, namely DY Ori, EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933\nand TW Cam, which are surrounded by a dusty disc. We also place them on the HR\ndiagram, thereby establishing their evolutionary nature. All the six Galactic\nRV Tauri stars included in this study are binaries with orbital periods ranging\nbetween $\\sim$ 650 and 1700 days and with eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.6.\nThe mass functions range between 0.08 to 0.55 M$_\\odot$ which points to an\nunevolved low mass companion. In the photometric time series we detect a\nlong-term variation on the time-scale of the orbital period for IRAS\n17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933 and TW Cam. Our derived stellar luminosities\nobtained from a calibrated PLC relation indicates that all except DY Ori and EP\nLyr, are post-AGB stars. DY Ori and EP Lyr are likely examples of the recently\ndiscovered dusty post-RGB stars. The orbital parameters strongly suggest that\nthe evolution of these stars was interrupted by a strong phase of binary\ninteraction during or even prior to the AGB. The observed eccentricities and\nlong orbital periods among these stars provides a challenge to the standard\ntheory of binary evolution.\n", "  We present H-band (1.6 {\\mu}m) scattered light observations of the\ntransitional disk RX J1615.3-3255, located in the ~1 Myr old Lupus association.\nFrom a polarized intensity image, taken with the HiCIAO instrument of the\nSubaru Telescope, we deduce the position angle and the inclination angle of the\ndisk. The disk is found to extend out to 68 $\\pm$ 12 AU in scattered light and\nno clear structure is observed. Our inner working angle of 24 AU does not allow\nus to detect a central decrease in intensity similar to that seen at 30 AU in\nthe 880 {\\mu}m continuum observations. We compare the observations with\nmultiple disk models based on the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and submm\ninterferometry and find that an inner rim of the outer disk at 30 AU containing\nsmall silicate grains produces a polarized intensity signal which is an order\nof magnitude larger than observed. We show that a model in which the small dust\ngrains extend smoothly into the cavity found for large grains is closer to the\nactual H-band observations. A comparison of models with different dust size\ndistributions suggests that the dust in the disk might have undergone\nsignificant processing compared to the interstellar medium.\n", "  We introduce a suite of thirty cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical zoom\nsimulations of the formation of galaxies in isolated Milky Way mass dark\nhaloes. These were carried out with the moving mesh code \\textlcsc{AREPO},\ntogether with a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, including AGN\nfeedback and magnetic fields, which produces realistic galaxy populations in\nlarge cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that our simulations reproduce a\nwide range of present-day observables, in particular, two component disc\ndominated galaxies with appropriate stellar masses, sizes, rotation curves,\nstar formation rates and metallicities. We investigate the driving mechanisms\nthat set present-day disc sizes/scale lengths, and find that they are related\nto the angular momentum of halo material. We show that the largest discs are\nproduced by quiescent mergers that inspiral into the galaxy and deposit high\nangular momentum material into the pre-existing disc, simultaneously increasing\nthe spin of dark matter and gas in the halo. More violent mergers and strong\nAGN feedback play roles in limiting disc size by destroying pre-existing discs\nand by suppressing gas accretion onto the outer disc, respectively. The most\nimportant factor that leads to compact discs, however, is simply a low angular\nmomentum for the halo. In these cases, AGN feedback plays an important role in\nlimiting central star formation and the formation of a massive bulge.\n", "  We study the physical and chemical properties of a sample of HII regions\nlocated at RG >11 kpc and present the radial distribution of abundances towards\nthe Galaxy anticentre.\n  We carried out optical spectroscopic observations of nine HII regions with\nthe WHT. The sample was increased by searching the literature for optical\nobservations of regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to\nobtain a single sample of 23 objects covering the Galactocentric radius from 11\nkpc to 18 kpc to be processed in a homogeneous and consistent manner. Accurate\nelectron densities and temperatures of several ionic species were derived in 13\nHII regions. These physical parameters were applied to the spectra to determine\ndirect total chemical abundances. For those regions without direct estimations\nof temperature, chemical abundances were derived by performing tailor-made\nphotoionisation models and/or by using an empirical relation obtained from\nradio recombination and optical temperatures.\n  We performed weighted least-squares fits to the distribution of the derived\nabundances along the Galactocentric distances to study the radial gradients of\nmetallicity. The distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre\ncan be represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of\nN/O abundances the radial distribution is better fitted with a two-zone model.\nThe He/H radial gradient is presented here for the first time; we find a slope\nthat is not significantly different from zero. The derived gradient for oxygen\nshows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of -0.053dex/kpc. Although a\nshallower slope at large Galactocentric distances is suggested by our data, the\nflattening of the distribution cannot be confirmed and more objects towards the\nanticentre need to be studied in order to establish the true form of the\nmetallicity gradient.\n", "  This work contributes to the study of non-equilibrium aspects of the Casimir\nforces with the introduction of squeezed states in the calculations. Throughout\nthis article two main results can be found, being both strongly correlated.\nPrimarily, the more formal result involves the development of a\nfirst-principles canonical quantization formalism to study the vacuum in\npresence different dissipative bodies in completely general scenarios. We\nconsidered a one-dimensional quantum scalar field interacting with the volume\nelements' degrees of freedom of the material bodies, which are modeled as\ncomposite systems consisting in a harmonic oscillators interacting with an\nenvironment. Solving the full dynamics of the composite system through its\nHeisenberg equations, we studied each contribution to the field operator by\nemploying general properties of the Green function. We deduced the long-time\nlimit of the field operator. In agreement with previous works, we showed that\nthe expectation values of the components of the energy-momentum tensor present\ntwo contributions, one associated to the thermal baths and the other one\nassociated to the field's initial conditions. This allows us to the direct\nstudy of steady situations involving different initial states for the field and\narbitrary thermal states for the baths. This leads to the other main result,\nconsisting in computing the Casimir force when the field is initially in\nthermal or continuum-single-mode squeezed states (characterized by a given\nbandwidth and frequency). Time-averaging is required for the squeezed case,\nshowing both results in a unified way. For the thermal state, all the\nwell-known equilibrium results can be successfully reproduced. Finally, we\ncompared the initial conditions' contribution and the total force for each\ncase, showing that the latter can be tuned in a wide range of values through\nvarying the size of the bandwidth.\n", "  For nine Mira-type stars (o Cet, R Leo, S Car, U Her, X Oph, R Aql, RR Aql, S\nOri, S Scl,) and one semi-regular star (L2 Pup), the mean light curves have\nbeen obtained. The initial values of the brightness (observations) were fitted\nby a trigonometric polynomial of the statistically optimal order. The Fourier\ncoefficients and the additional parameters (degree of the trigonometric\npolynomial, amplitude of the brightness, the maximal slope of ascending and\ndescending branch, semi-amplitudes and initial epochs for the brightness\nmaximum (minimum magnitude) of each harmonic contribution, etc., were given in\nthe tables reported earlier (Kudashkina, 2015). In this study, we have received\nseveral interesting correlations between these parameters in the bands H and K.\nIt was particularly noted the anomalous position on the figures of the star X\nOph. The mean light curves of the investigated stars are commonly symmetric in\nthe near infrared region (H and K).\n", "  One of the most outstanding results of the Chandra X-ray Observatory was the\ndiscovery that AGN jets are bright X-ray emitters on very large scales, up to\nhundreds of kpc. Of these, the powerful and beamed jets of Flat Spectrum Radio\nQuasars are particularly interesting, as the X-ray emission cannot be explained\nby an extrapolation of the lower frequency synchrotron spectrum. Instead, the\nmost common model invokes inverse Compton scattering of photons of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (EC/CMB) as the mechanism responsible for the high energy\nemission. The EC/CMB model has recently come under criticism, particularly\nbecause it should predict a significant steady flux in the MeV-GeV band which\nhas not been detected by the Fermi/LAT telescope for two of the best studied\njets (PKS 0637-752 and 3C273). In this work we revisit some aspects of the\nEC/CMB model and show that electron cooling plays an important part in shaping\nthe spectrum. This can solve the overproduction of gamma-rays by suppressing\nthe high energy end of the emitting particle population. Furthermore, we show\nthat cooling in the EC/CMB model predicts a new class of extended jets that are\nbright in X-rays but silent in the radio and optical bands. These jets are more\nlikely to lie at intermediate redshifts, and would have been missed in all\nprevious X-ray surveys due to selection effects.\n", "  $Aims.$ We study the relation between the jet and the outflow in the IRAS\n04166+2706 protostar. This Taurus protostar drives a molecular jet that\ncontains multiple emission peaks symmetrically located from the central source.\nThe protostar also drives a wide-angle outflow consisting of two conical\nshells.\n  $Methods.$ We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) interferometer to observe two fields along the IRAS 04166+2706 jet. The\nfields were centered on a pair of emission peaks that correspond to the same\nejection event, and were observed in CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), and SO(65-54).\n  $ Results.$ Both ALMA fields present spatial distributions that are\napproximately elliptical and have their minor axes aligned with the jet\ndirection. As the velocity increases, the emission in each field moves\ngradually across the elliptical region. This systematic pattern indicates that\nthe emitting gas in each field lies in a disk-like structure that is\nperpendicular to the jet axis and is expanding away from the jet. A small\ndegree of curvature in the first-moment maps indicates that the disks are\nslightly curved in the manner expected for bow shocks moving away from the IRAS\nsource. A simple geometrical model confirms that this scenario fits the main\nemission features.\n  $Conclusions.$ The emission peaks in the IRAS 04166+2706 jet likely represent\ninternal bow shocks where material is being ejected laterally away from the jet\naxis. While the linear momentum of the ejected gas is dominated by the\ncomponent in the jet direction, the sideways component is not negligible, and\ncan potentially affect the distribution of gas in the surrounding outflow and\ncore.\n", "  Optical microlensing surveys are restricted from detecting events near the\nGalactic plane and center, where the event rate is thought to be the highest,\ndue to the high optical extinction of these fields. In the near-infrared (NIR),\nhowever, the lower extinction leads to a corresponding increase in event\ndetections and is a primary driver for the wavelength coverage of the $WFIRST$\nmicrolensing survey. During the 2015 and 2016 bulge observing seasons we\nconducted NIR microlensing surveys with UKIRT in conjunction with and in\nsupport of the $Spitzer$ and $Kepler$ microlensing campaigns. Here we report on\nfive highly extinguished ($A_H=0.81-1.97$), low-Galactic latitude ($-0.98\\le\nb\\le -0.36$) microlensing events discovered from our 2016 survey. Four of them\nwere monitored with an hourly cadence by optical surveys but were not reported\nas discoveries, likely due to the high extinction. Our UKIRT surveys and\nsuggested future NIR surveys enable the first measurement of the microlensing\nevent rate in the NIR. This wavelength regime overlaps with the bandpass of the\nfilter in which the $WFIRST$ microlensing survey will conduct its\nhighest-cadence observations, making this event rate derivation critically\nimportant for optimizing its yield.\n", "  (Abridged) In the last decade several massive molecular gas reservoirs were\nfound <100 kpc distance from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), residing in\ngas-rich companion galaxies. The study of AGN-gas-rich companion systems opens\nthe opportunity to determine whether the stellar mass of massive local galaxies\nwas formed in their host after a merger event or outside of their host galaxy\nin a close starbursting companion and later incorporated via mergers. We study\nthe quasar-companion galaxy system of SMM J04135+10277 (z=2.84) and investigate\nthe expected frequency of quasar-starburst galaxy pairs at high redshift using\na cosmological galaxy formation model. We use archive data and new APEX ArTeMiS\ndata to construct and model the spectral energy distribution of SMM J04135. We\nalso carry out a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological galaxy formation\nmodel GALFORM with the aim of characterising how typical the system of SMM\nJ04135 is and whether quasar-star-forming galaxy pairs may constitute an\nimportant stage in galaxy evolution. The companion galaxy of SMM J04135 is a\nheavily dust-obscured starburst galaxy with a median star formation rate (SFR)\nof $700\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$, median dust mass of $5.1\\times\n10^9\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and median dust luminosity of $\\textrm 9.3 \\times\n10^{12}\\,\\rm{L_{\\odot}}$. Our simulations, performed at z=2.8, suggest that SMM\nJ04135 is not unique. In fact, at a distance of <100 kpc, 22% of our simulated\nquasar sample have at least one companion galaxy of a stellar mass $>10^8\\,\n\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, and 0.3% have at least one highly star-forming companion\n($\\rm{SFR}>100\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$). Our results suggest that\nquasar-gas-rich companion galaxy systems are common phenomena in the early\nUniverse and the high incidence of companions makes the study of such systems\ncrucial to understand the growth and hierarchical build-up of galaxies and\nblack holes.\n", "  We present first-principles density functional calculations of the electronic\nstructure, magnetism, and structural stability of 378 $\\textit{XYZ}$\nhalf-Heusler compounds (with $X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, $Y=$ Ti, V, Cr,\nMn, Fe, Ni, $Z=$ Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, P, As, Sb). We find that a\n\"Slater-Pauling density of states\" with a gap or pseudogap at three states per\natom below the gap in at least one spin channel is a common feature in\nhalf-Heusler compounds. We find that the presence of such a gap at the Fermi\nenergy in one or both spin channels contributes greatly to the stability of a\nhalf-Heusler compound. We calculate the formation energy of each compound and\nsystematically investigate its stability against all other phases in the Open\nQuantum Materials Database (OQMD). We represent the thermodynamic phase\nstability of each compound as its distance from the convex hull of stable\nphases in the respective chemical space and show that the hull distance of a\ncompound is a good measure of the likelihood of its experimental synthesis. We\nidentify 26 18-electron semiconductors, 45 half-metals, and 34 near half-metals\nwith negative formation energy, that follow the Slater-Pauling rule of three\nelectrons per atom. Our calculations predict new thermodynamically stable\nsemiconducting phases NiScAs, RhTiP, and RuVAs, which merit further\nexperimental exploration. Further, two interesting zero-moment half-metals,\nCrMnAs and MnCrAs, are calculated to have negative formation energy. In\naddition, our calculations predict a number of new, hitherto unreported,\nsemiconducting (e.g., CoVGe, FeVAs), half-metallic (e.g., RhVSb), near\nhalf-metallic (e.g., CoFeSb, CoVP) half-Heusler compounds to lie close to the\nrespective convex hull of stable phases, and thus may be experimentally\nrealized under suitable synthesis conditions, resulting in potential candidates\nfor various spintronics applications.\n", "  We use the Halo Model to explore the implications of assuming that galaxy\nluminosities in groups are randomly drawn from an underlying luminosity\nfunction. We show that even the simplest of such order statistics models -- one\nin which this luminosity function $p(L)$ is universal -- naturally produces a\nnumber of features associated with previous analyses based on the `central plus\nPoisson satellites' hypothesis. These include the monotonic relation of mean\ncentral luminosity with halo mass, the Lognormal distribution around this mean,\nand the tight relation between the central and satellite mass scales. In stark\ncontrast to observations of galaxy clustering, however, this model predicts\n$\\textit{no}$ luminosity dependence of large scale clustering. We then show\nthat an extended version of this model, based on the order statistics of a\n$\\textit{halo mass dependent}$ luminosity function $p(L|m)$, is in much better\nagreement with the clustering data as well as satellite luminosities, but\nsystematically under-predicts central luminosities. This brings into focus the\nidea that central galaxies constitute a distinct population that is affected by\ndifferent physical processes than are the satellites. We model this physical\ndifference as a statistical brightening of the central luminosities, over and\nabove the order statistics prediction. The magnitude gap between the brightest\nand second brightest group galaxy is predicted as a by-product, and is also in\ngood agreement with observations. We propose that this order statistics\nframework provides a useful language in which to compare the Halo Model for\ngalaxies with more physically motivated galaxy formation models\n", "  We describe the SpArc science gateway for spectral data obtained during the\nperiod from 1975 through 1995 at the Kitt Peak National Observatory using the\nFourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) in operation at the Mayall 4-m telescope.\nSpArc is hosted by Indiana University Bloomington and is available for public\naccess. The archive includes nearly 10,000 individual spectra of more than 800\ndifferent astronomical sources including stars, nebulae, galaxies, and Solar\nSystem objects. We briefly describe the FTS instrument itself, and summarize\nthe conversion of the original interferograms into spectral data and the\nprocess for recovering the data into FITS files. The architecture of the\narchive is discussed, and the process for retrieving data from the archive is\nintroduced. Sample use cases showing typical FTS spectra are presented.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations of star formation often do not possess the dynamic\nrange needed to fully resolve the build-up of individual stars and star\nclusters, and thus have to resort to subgrid models. A popular way to do this\nis by introducing Lagrangian sink particles, which replace contracting high\ndensity regions at the point where the resolution limit is reached. A common\nproblem then is how to assign fundamental stellar properties to sink particles,\nsuch as the distribution of stellar masses.\n  We present a new and simple statistical method to assign stellar contents to\nsink particles. Once the stellar content is specified, it can be used to\ndetermine a sink particle's radiative output, supernovae rate or other feedback\nparameters that may be required in the calculations. Advantages of our method\nare (i) it is simple to implement, (ii) it guarantees that the obtained stellar\npopulations are good samples of the initial mass function, (iii) it can easily\ndeal with infalling mass accreted at later times, and (iv) it does not put\nrestrictions on the sink particles' masses in order to be used. The method\nworks very well for sink particles that represent large star clusters and for\nwhich the stellar mass function is well sampled, but can also handle the\ntransition to sink particles that represent a small number of stars.\n", "  The $\\beta$ decay of the drip-line nucleus $^{20}$Mg gives important\ninformation on resonances in $^{20}$Na, which are relevant for the\nastrophysical $rp$-process. A detailed $\\beta$ decay spectroscopic study of\n$^{20}$Mg was performed by a continuous-implantation method. A detection system\nwas specially developed for charged-particle decay studies, giving improved\nspectroscopic information including the half-life of $^{20}$Mg, the excitation\nenergies, the branching ratios, and the log $ft$ values for the states in\n$^{20}$Na populated in the $\\beta$ decay of $^{20}$Mg. A new proton branch was\nobserved and the corresponding excited state in $^{20}$Na was proposed. The\nlarge isospin asymmetry for the mirror decays of $^{20}$Mg and $^{20}$O was\nreproduced, as well. However, no conclusive conclusion can be draw about the\nastrophysically interesting 2645~keV resonance in $^{20}$Na due to the limited\nstatistics.\n", "  The paper introduces the software Spectangular for spectral disentangling via\nsingular value decomposition with global optimisation of the orbital parameters\nof the stellar system or radial velocities of the individual observations. We\nwill describe the procedure and the different options implemented in our\nprogram. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the performance and the applicability\nusing tests on artificial data. Additionally, we use high-resolution spectra of\nCapella to demonstrate the performance of our code on real-world data. The\nnovelty of this package is the implemented global optimisation algorithm and\nthe graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. We have implemented the\ncode to tackle SB1 and SB2 systems with the option of also dealing with\ntelluric (static) lines.\n", "  We study the possibility to detect and distinguish signatures of enrichment\nfrom PopIII stars in observations of PopII GRBs (GRBIIs) at high redshift by\nusing numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations including atomic and\nmolecular cooling, star formation and metal spreading from stellar populations\nwith different initial mass functions (IMFs), yields and lifetimes. PopIII and\nPopII star formation regimes are followed simultaneously and both a top-heavy\nand a Salpeter-like IMF for pristine PopIII star formation are adopted. We find\nthat the fraction of GRBIIs hosted in a medium previously enriched by PopIII\nstars (PopIII-dominated) is model independent. Typical abundance ratios, such\nas [Si/O] vs [C/O] and [Fe/C] vs [Si/C], can help to disentangle enrichment\nfrom massive and intermediate PopIII stars, while low-mass first stars are\ndegenerate with regular PopII generations. The properties of galaxies hosting\nPopIII-dominated GRBIIs are not very sensitive to the particular assumption on\nthe mass of the first stars.\n", "  In the last 10 years, since its last giant outburst in 2006, regular X-ray\noutbursts (type I) were detected every periastron passage in the Be X-ray\nbinary EXO 2030+375. Recently, however, it was reported that the source started\nto show a peculiar behavior: its X-ray flux decreased significantly and type I\noutbursts were missed in several cases. At the same time, the spin frequency of\nthe neutron star, which had been increasing steadily since the end of the 2006\ngiant outburst, reached a plateau. Very recent observations indicate that the\nsource is now starting to spin down. These observed phenomena have a striking\nsimilarity with those which took place 20 years ago, just before the source\ndisplayed a sudden orbital phase shift of the outburst peak (1995). This\nhistorical event occurred at the time exactly between the two giant outbursts\n(1985 and 2006). These phenomena suggest the system to have an underlying\nperiodicity of 10.5 years between orbital phase shifts and/or giant outbursts.\nThe suggested periodicity may reflect some long-period dynamics in the\ncircumstellar disk of the Be star, due, e.g., to the Kozai-Lidov effect. A\nmodel generating such a periodic change of the Be disk, namely Kozai-Lidov\noscillations in the Be disk, is discussed. If this behavior is really\nperiodical, another phase shift of the X-ray outburst peak is predicted to\noccur around 2016 December.\n", "  We perform fully-coupled numerical simulations of helium II pure superflows\nin a channel, with vortex- line density typical of experiments. Peculiar to our\nmodel is the computation of the back-reaction of the superfluid vortex motion\non the normal fluid and the presence of solid boundaries. We recover the\nuniform vortex-line density experimentally measured employing second sound\nresonators and we show that pure superflow in helium II is associated with a\nlarge-scale circulation of the normal fluid which can be detected using\nexisting particle-tracking visualization techniques.\n", "  We present the results of an analysis of 21 spectra of alpha UMi (Polaris)\nobtained in September - December 2015. Frequency analysis shows an increase of\nthe pulsation period up to 8.6 min in comparison to the 2007 observational set.\nThe radial velocity amplitude comes to 4.16 km s^-1, and it approximately twice\nthe one found in 2007. The average Teff = 6017 K, and it is close to the value\ndetermined for the 2001-2004 set. Therefore Polaris moves to the red edge of\nthe Cepheid instability strip (CIS)\n", "  While about a dozen transiting planets have been found in wide orbits around\nan inner, close stellar binary (so-called \"P-type planets\"), no planet has yet\nbeen detected orbiting only one star (a so-called \"S-type planet\") in an\neclipsing binary. This is despite a large number of eclipsing binary systems\ndiscovered with the Kepler telescope. Here we propose a new detection method\nfor these S-type planets, which uses a correlation between the stellar radial\nvelocities (RVs), eclipse timing variations (ETVs), and eclipse duration\nvariations (EDVs). We test the capability of this technique by simulating a\nrealistic benchmark system and demonstrate its detectability with existing\nhigh-accuracy RV and photometry instruments. We illustrate that, with a small\nnumber of RV observations, the RV-ETV diagrams allows us to distinguish between\nprograde and retrograde planetary orbits and also the planetary mass can be\nestimated if the stellar cross-correlation functions can be disentangled. We\nalso identify a new (though minimal) contribution of S-type planets to the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect in eclipsing stellar binaries. We finally explore\npossible detection of exomoons around transiting luminous giant planets and\nfind that the precision required to detect moons in the RV curves of their host\nplanets is of the order of ${\\rm cm\\,s}^{-1}$ and therefore not accessible with\ncurrent instruments.\n", "  The recent discovery of gravitational waves from merging black holes has\ngenerated interest in primordial black holes as a possible component of the\ndark matter. In this paper, we show that pulsar timing may soon have sufficient\ndata to constrain $1$-$1000\\,M_{\\odot}$ primordial black holes via the\nnon-detection of a third-order Shapiro time delay as the black holes move\naround the Galactic halo. We present the results of a Monte Carlo simulation\nwhich suggests that future data from known pulsars may be capable of\nconstraining the PBH density more stringently than other existing methods in\nthe mass range ~1-30$\\,M_{\\odot}$. We find that timing new pulsars discovered\nusing the proposed Square Kilometre Array may constrain primordial black holes\nin this mass range to comprise less than ~1-10% of the dark matter.\n", "  The raw coronagraphic performance of current high-contrast imaging\ninstruments is limited by the presence of a quasi-static speckle (QSS)\nbackground, resulting from instrumental non-common path errors (NCPEs). Rapid\ndevelopment of efficient speckle subtraction techniques in data reduction has\nenabled final contrasts of up to 10-6 to be obtained, however it remains\npreferable to eliminate the underlying NCPEs at the source. In this work we\nintroduce the coronagraphic Modal Wavefront Sensor (cMWS), a new wavefront\nsensor suitable for real-time NCPE correction. This pupil-plane optic combines\nthe apodizing phase plate coronagraph with a holographic modal wavefront\nsensor, to provide simultaneous coronagraphic imaging and focal-plane wavefront\nsensing using the science point spread function. We first characterise the\nbaseline performance of the cMWS via idealised closed-loop simulations, showing\nthat the sensor successfully recovers diffraction-limited coronagraph\nperformance over an effective dynamic range of +/-2.5 radians root-mean-square\n(RMS) wavefront error within 2-10 iterations. We then present the results of\ninitial on-sky testing at the William Herschel Telescope, and demonstrate that\nthe sensor is able to retrieve injected wavefront aberrations to an accuracy of\n10nm RMS under realistic seeing conditions. We also find that the cMWS is\ncapable of real-time broadband measurement of atmospheric wavefront variance at\na cadence of 50Hz across an uncorrected telescope sub-aperture. When combined\nwith a suitable closed-loop adaptive optics system, the cMWS holds the\npotential to deliver an improvement in raw contrast of up to two orders of\nmagnitude over the uncorrected QSS floor. Such a sensor would be eminently\nsuitable for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with both\nexisting and future instruments, including EPICS and METIS for the E-ELT.\n", "  We explore the distant giant planet hypothesis by integrating the large\nsemi-major axis, large pericenter Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in the\npresence of the giant planets and an external perturber whose orbit is\nconsistent with the proposed distant, eccentric, and inclined giant planet, so\ncalled planet 9. We find that TNOs with semi-major axes greater than 250 au\nexperience some longitude of perihelion shepherding, but that a generic outcome\nof such evolutions is that the TNOs evolve to larger pericenter orbits, and\ncommonly get raised to retrograde inclinations. This pericenter and inclination\nevolution requires a massive disk of TNOs (tens of M$_\\Earth$) in order to\nexplain the detection of the known sample today. Some of the highly inclined\norbits produced by the examined perturbers will be inside of the orbital\nparameter space probed by prior surveys, implying a missing signature of the\n9th planet scenario. The distant giant planet scenarios explored in this work\ndo not reproduce the observed signal of simultaneous clustering in argument of\npericenter, longitude of the ascending node, and longitude of perihelion in the\nregion of the known TNOs.\n", "  Local aspects of magnetism of disordered FePt are investigated by ab initio\nfully relativistic full potential calculations, employing the supercell\napproach and the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The focus is on trends\nof the spin and orbital magnetic moments with chemical composition and with\nbond lengths around the Fe and Pt atoms. A small but distinct difference\nbetween average magnetic moments obtained when using the supercells and when\nrelying on the CPA is identified and linked to the neglect of the Madelung\npotential in the CPA.\n", "  The algorithm is described, which have been used for photo-polarimetric\nmonitoring of various astronomical objects - cataclysmic variables, asteroids,\ncomets.\n", "  We report a lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic light-by-light\ncontribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment at physical pion mass. The\ncalculation includes the connected diagrams and the leading,\nquark-line-disconnected diagrams. We incorporate algorithmic improvements\ndeveloped in our previous work. The calculation was performed on the $48^3\n\\times 96$ ensemble generated with a physical-pion-mass and a 5.5 fm spatial\nextent by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations using the chiral, domain wall\nfermion (DWF) formulation. We find $a_\\mu^{\\text{HLbL}} = 5.35 (1.35) \\times\n10^{- 10}$, where the error is statistical only. The finite-volume and finite\nlattice-spacing errors could be quite large and are the subject of on-going\nresearch. The omitted disconnected graphs, while expected to give a correction\nof order 10\\%, also need to be computed.\n", "  The are several non-equivalent notions of Markovian quantum evolution. In\nthis paper we show that the one based on the so-called CP-divisibility of the\ncorresponding dynamical map enjoys the following stability property: the\ndynamical map $\\Lambda_t$ is CP-divisible iff the second tensor power\n$\\Lambda_t\\otimes\\Lambda_t$ is CP-divisible as well. Moreover, the\nP-divisibility of the map $\\Lambda_t\\otimes\\Lambda_t$ is equivalent to the\nCP-divisibility of the map $\\Lambda_t$. Interestingly, the latter property is\nno longer true if we replace the P-divisibility of $\\Lambda_t\\otimes\\Lambda_t$\nby simple positivity and the CP-divisibility of $\\Lambda_t$ by complete\npositivity. That is, unlike when $\\Lambda_t$ has a time-independent generator,\npositivity of $\\Lambda_t\\otimes\\Lambda_t$ does not imply complete positivity of\n$\\Lambda_t$.\n", "  While Flory theories provide an extremely useful framework for understanding\nthe behavior of interacting, randomly branching polymers, the approach is\ninherently limited. Here we use a combination of scaling arguments and computer\nsimulations to go beyond a Gaussian description. We analyse distributions\nfunctions for a wide variety of quantities characterising the tree\nconnectivities and conformations for the four different statistical ensembles,\nwhich we have studied numerically in [Rosa and Everaers, J. Phys. A (2016,\npublished) and J. Chem. Phys. (2016, to appear)]: (a) ideal randomly branching\npolymers, (b) $2d$ and $3d$ melts of interacting randomly branching polymers,\n(c) $3d$ self-avoiding trees with annealed connectivity and (d) $3d$\nself-avoiding trees with quenched ideal connectivity. In particular, we\ninvestigate the distributions (i) $p_N(n)$ of the weight, $n$, of branches cut\nfrom trees of mass $N$ by severing randomly chosen bonds; (ii) $p_N(l)$ of the\ncontour distances, $l$, between monomers; (iii) $p_N(\\vec r)$ of spatial\ndistances, $\\vec r$, between monomers, and (iv) $p_N(\\vec r|l)$ of the\nend-to-end distance of paths of length $l$. Data for different tree sizes\nsuperimpose, when expressed as functions of suitably rescaled observables $\\vec\nx = \\vec r/\\langle r^2(N) \\rangle$ or $x =l/\\langle l(N) \\rangle$. In\nparticular, we observe a generalised Kramers relation for the branch weight\ndistributions (i) and find that all the other distributions (ii-iv) are of\nRedner-des Cloizeaux type, $q(\\vec x) = C \\, |x|^\\theta\\ \\exp \\left( -(K |x|)^t\n\\right)$. We propose a coherent framework, including generalised Fisher-Pincus\nrelations, relating most of the RdC exponents to each other and to the contact\nand Flory exponents for interacting trees.\n", "  The length and pattern speed of the Milky Way bar are still controversial.\nPhotometric and spectroscopic surveys of the inner Galaxy, as well as gas\nkinematics, favour a long and slowly rotating bar, with corotation around a\nGalactocentric radius of 6 kpc. On the other hand, the existence of the\nHercules stream in local velocity space favours a short and fast bar with\ncorotation around 4 kpc. This follows from the fact that the Hercules stream\nlooks like a typical signature of the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar. As\nwe showed recently, reconciling this local stream with a slow bar would need to\nfind a yet unknown alternative explanation, based for instance on the effect of\nspiral arms. Here, by combining the TGAS catalogue of the Gaia DR1 with LAMOST\nradial velocities, we show that the position of Hercules in velocity space as a\nfunction of radius in the outer Galaxy indeed varies exactly as predicted by\nfast bar models with a pattern speed no less than 1.8 times the circular\nfrequency at the Sun's position.\n", "  The detection of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves has\ngreat promise for the investigation of many scientific questions. It has long\nbeen hoped that in addition to providing extra, non-gravitational information\nabout the sources of these signals, the detection of an electromagnetic signal\nin conjunction with a gravitational wave could aid in the analysis of the\ngravitational signal itself. That is, knowledge of the sky location,\ninclination, and redshift of a binary could break degeneracies between these\nextrinsic, coordinate-dependent parameters and the physical parameters, such as\nmass and spin, that are intrinsic to the binary. In this paper, we investigate\nthis issue by assuming a perfect knowledge of extrinsic parameters, and\nassessing the maximal impact of this knowledge on our ability to extract\nintrinsic parameters. However, we find only modest improvements in a few\nparameters --- namely the primary component's spin --- and conclude that, even\nin the best case, the use of additional information from electromagnetic\nobservations does not improve the measurement of the intrinsic parameters\nsignificantly.\n", "  We perform a magneto-infrared spectroscopy study of the semiconductor to\nsemimetal transition of InAs/GaSb double quantum wells from the normal to the\ninverted state. We show that owing to the low carrier density of our samples\n(approaching the intrinsic limit), the magneto-absorption spectra evolve from a\nsingle cyclotron resonance peak in the normal state to multiple absorption\npeaks in the inverted state with distinct magnetic field dependence. Using an\neight-band Pidgeon-Brown model, we explain all the major absorption peaks\nobserved in our experiment. We demonstrate that the semiconductor to semimetal\ntransition can be realized by manipulating the quantum confinement, the strain,\nand the magnetic field. Our work paves the way for band engineering of optimal\nInAs/GaSb structures for realizing novel topological states as well as for\ndevice applications in the terahertz regime.\n", "  We present high signal-to-noise ratio, precise $YJH$ photometry and $Y$ band\n(\\gpiwave~$\\mu$m) spectroscopy of HD 1160 B, a young substellar companion\ndiscovered from the Gemini NICI Planet Finding Campaign, using the Subaru\nCoronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics instrument and the Gemini Planet Imager.\nHD 1160 B has typical mid-M dwarf-like infrared colors and a spectral type of\nM5.5$^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$, where the blue edge of our $Y$ band spectrum rules out\nearlier spectral types. Atmospheric modeling suggests HD 1160 B having an\neffective temperature of 3000--3100 $K$, a surface gravity of log $g$ = 4--4.5,\na radius of~\\bestfitradius~$R_{\\rm J}$, and a luminosity of log $L$/$L_{\\odot}\n= -2.76 \\pm 0.05$. Neither the primary's Hertzspring-Russell diagram position\nnor atmospheric modeling of HD 1160 B show evidence for a sub-solar\nmetallicity. The interpretation of the HD 1160 B depends on which stellar\nsystem components are used to estimate an age. Considering HD 1160 A, B and C\njointly, we derive an age of 80--125 Myr, implying that HD 1160 B straddles the\nhydrogen-burning limit (70--90 $M_{\\rm J}$). If we consider HD 1160 A alone,\nyounger ages (20--125 Myr) and a brown dwarf-like mass (35--90 $M_{\\rm J}$) are\npossible. Interferometric measurements of the primary, a precise GAIA parallax,\nand moderate resolution spectroscopy can better constrain the system's age and\nhow HD 1160 B fits within the context of (sub)stellar evolution.\n", "  We present a prescription for parametrizing the chemical profile in the core\nof white dwarfs in the light of the recent discovery that pulsation modes may\nsometimes be deeply confined in some cool pulsating white dwarfs. Such modes\nmay be used as unique probes of the complicated chemical stratification that\nresults from several processes that occurred in previous evolutionary phases of\nintermediate-mass stars. This effort is part of our ongoing quest for more\ncredible and realistic seismic models of white dwarfs using static,\nparametrized equilibrium structures. Inspired from successful techniques\ndeveloped in design optimization fields (such as aerodynamics), we exploit\nAkima splines for the tracing of the chemical profile of oxygen (carbon) in the\ncore of a white dwarf model. A series of tests are then presented to better\nseize the precision and significance of the results that can be obtained in an\nasteroseismological context. We also show that the new parametrization passes\nan essential basic test, as it successfully reproduces the chemical\nstratification of a full evolutionary model.\n", "  We report the discovery of relatively massive, M32-like ultra compact dwarf\n(UCD) and compact elliptical (CE) galaxy candidates in $0.2<z<0.6$ massive\ngalaxy clusters imaged by the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with {\\it\nHubble} (CLASH) survey. Examining the nearly unresolved objects in the survey,\nwe identify a sample of compact objects concentrated around the cluster central\ngalaxies with colors similar to cluster red sequence galaxies. Their colors and\nmagnitudes suggest stellar masses around $10^9 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. More than\nhalf of these galaxies have half-light radii smaller than 200 pc, falling into\nthe category of massive UCDs and CEs, with properties similar to M32. The\nproperties are consistent with a tidal stripping origin, but we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that they are early-formed compact objects trapped in massive\ndark matter halos. The 17 CLASH clusters studied in this work on average\ncontain 2.7 of these objects in their central 0.3 Mpc and 0.6 in their central\n50 kpc. Our study demonstrates the possibility of statistically characterizing\nUCDs/CEs with a large set of uniform imaging survey data.\n", "  With four years of nearly-continuous photometry from Kepler, we are finally\nin a good position to apply asteroseismology to $\\gamma$ Doradus stars. In\nparticular several analyses have demonstrated the possibility to detect\nnon-uniform period spacings, which have been predicted to be directly related\nto rotation. In the present work, we define a new seismic diagnostic for\nrotation in $\\gamma$ Doradus stars that are too rapidly rotating to present\nrotational splittings. Based on the non uniformity of their period spacings, we\ndefine the observable $\\Sigma$ as the slope of the period spacing when plotted\nas a function of period. We provide a one-to-one relation between this\nobservable $\\Sigma$ and the internal rotation, which applies widely in the\ninstability strip of $\\gamma$ Doradus stars. We apply the diagnostic to a\nhandful of stars observed by Kepler. Thanks to g-modes in $\\gamma$ Doradus\nstars, we are now able to determine the internal rotation of stars on the lower\nmain sequence, which is still not possible for Sun-like stars.\n", "  In most astrophysical situations, the radioactive decay of 56Ni to 56Co\noccurs via electron capture with a fixed half-life of 6.1 days. However, this\ndecay rate is significantly slowed when the nuclei are fully ionized because\nK-shell electrons are unavailable for capture. In this paper, we explore the\neffect of these delayed decays on white dwarfs (WDs) that may survive Type Ia\nand Type Iax supernovae (SNe Ia and SNe Iax). The energy released by the\ndelayed radioactive decays of 56Ni and 56Co drives a persistent wind from the\nsurviving WD's surface that contributes to the late-time appearance of these\nSNe after emission from the bulk of the SN ejecta has faded. We use the stellar\nevolution code MESA to calculate the hydrodynamical evolution and resulting\nlight curves of these winds. Our post-SN Ia models conflict with late-time\nobservations of SN 2011fe, but uncertainties in our initial conditions prevent\nus from ruling out the existence of surviving WD donors. Much better agreement\nwith observations is achieved with our post-SN Iax bound remnant models,\nproviding evidence that these explosions are due to deflagrations in accreting\nWDs that fail to completely unbind the WDs. Future radiative transfer\ncalculations and wind models utilizing explosion simulations for more accurate\ninitial conditions will extend our study of radioactively-powered winds from\npost-SN surviving WDs and enable their use as powerful discriminants among the\nvarious SN Ia and SN Iax progenitor scenarios.\n", "  We present a framework which unifies a large class of non-commutative\nspacetimes that can be described in terms of a deformed Heisenberg algebra. The\ncommutation relations between spacetime coordinates are up to linear order in\nthe coordinates, with structure constants depending on the momenta plus terms\ndepending only on the momenta. The possible implementations of the action of\nLorentz transformations on these deformed phase spaces are considered, together\nwith the consistency requirements they introduce. It is found that Lorentz\ntransformations in general act nontrivially on tensor products of momenta. In\nparticular the Lorentz group element which acts on the left and on the right of\na composition of two momenta is different, and depends on the momenta involved\nin the process. We conclude with two representative examples, which illustrate\nthe mentioned effect.\n", "  In this paper we argue that monojet and monophoton searches can be a\nsensitive test of very highly ionizing particles such as particles with charges\n$\\gtrsim 150e$ and more generally particles that do not reach the outer parts\nof the detector. 8 TeV monojet data from the CMS experiment excludes such\nobjects with masses in the range $\\lesssim 650~{\\text{GeV}}$ and charges\n$\\gtrsim 100e$. This nicely complements searches for highly ionizing objects at\nALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. Expected improvements in these channels will extend\nthe sensitivity range to $m\\lesssim 750~{\\text{GeV}}$. This search strategy can\ndirectly be generalized to other particles that strongly interact with the\ndetector material, such as e.g. magnetic monopoles.\n", "  The Galaxy Zoo 1 catalog displays a bias towards the S-wise winding direction\nin spiral galaxies which has yet to be explained. The lack of an explanation\nconfounds our attempts to verify the Cosmological Principle, and has spurred\nsome debate as to whether a bias exists in the real universe. The bias\nmanifests not only in the obvious case of trying to decide if the universe as a\nwhole has a winding bias, but also in the more insidious case of selecting\nwhich galaxies to include in a winding direction survey. While the former bias\nhas been accounted for in a previous image-mirroring study, the latter has not.\nFurthermore, the bias has never been {\\em corrected} in the GZ1 catalog, as\nonly a small sample of the GZ1 catalog was re-examined during the mirror study.\nWe show that the existing bias is a human {\\em selection} effect rather than a\nhuman chirality bias. In effect, the excess S-wise votes are spuriously\n\"stolen\" from the elliptical and edge-on-disk categories, not the Z-wise\ncategory. Thus, when selecting a set of spiral galaxies by imposing a threshold\n$T$ so that $\\max(P_S,P_Z) > T$ or $P_S+P_Z>T$, we spuriously select more\nS-wise than Z-wise galaxies. We show that when a provably unbiased machine\nselects which galaxies are spirals independent of their chirality, the S-wise\nsurplus vanishes, even if humans are still used to determine the chirality.\nThus, when viewed across the entire GZ1 sample (and by implication, the Sloan\ncatalog), the winding direction of arms in spiral galaxies as viewed from Earth\nis consistent with the flip of a fair coin.\n", "  The recent detections of two transit events attributed to the super-Earth\ncandidate K2-18b have provided the unprecedented prospect of spectroscopically\nstudying a habitable-zone planet outside the Solar System. Orbiting a nearby\nM2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b\nwould be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization\nof a habitable-zone exoplanet using HST and JWST. Here, we report the detection\nof a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the\ntwo transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by\na super-Earth in a 33-day orbit and ruling out the alternative scenario of two\nsimilarly-sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75-day K2\nobservation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer\noccurred 1.85 hours (7-sigma) before the predicted transit time. Our joint\nanalysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of\nthe transit is not caused by transit timing variations (TTVs), but the result\nof an inaccurate K2 ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in\nthe K2 photometry likely caused by a cosmic ray hit. We refit the ephemeris and\nfind that K2-18b would have been lost for future atmospheric characterizations\nwith HST and JWST if we had not secured its ephemeris shortly after the\ndiscovery. We caution that immediate follow-up observations as presented here\nwill also be critical in confirming and securing future planets discovered by\nTESS, in particular if only two transit events are covered by the relatively\nshort 27-day TESS campaigns.\n", "  Partial-wave analysis of meson and photon-induced reactions is needed to\nenable the comparison of many theoretical approaches to data. In both\nenergy-dependent and independent parametrizations of partial waves, the\nselection of the model amplitude is crucial. Principles of the $S$-matrix are\nimplemented to different degree in different approaches, but a many times\noverlooked aspect concerns the selection of undetermined coefficients and\nfunctional forms for fitting, leading to a minimal yet sufficient\nparametrization. We present an analysis of low-energy neutral pion\nphotoproduction using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\n(LASSO) in combination with criteria from information theory and $K$-fold cross\nvalidation. These methods are not yet widely known in the analysis of excited\nhadrons but will become relevant in the era of precision spectroscopy. The\nprinciple is first illustrated with synthetic data, then, its feasibility for\nreal data is demonstrated by analyzing the latest available measurements of\ndifferential cross sections ($d\\sigma/d\\Omega$), photon-beam asymmetries\n($\\Sigma$), and target asymmetry differential cross sections\n($d\\sigma_T/d\\Omega$) in the low energy regime.\n", "  We consider conductance mapping of the snake-orbits confined along the n-p\njunction defined in graphene by the electrostatic doping in the quantum Hall\nregime. We explain the periodicity of conductance oscillations at the magnetic\nfield and the Fermi energy scales by the properties of the n-p junction as a\nconducting channel. We evaluate the conductance maps for a floating gate\nscanning the surface of the device. In the quantum Hall conditions the currents\nflow near the edges of the sample and along the n-p junction. The conductance\nmapping resolves only the n-p junction and not the edges. The conductance\noscillations along the junction are found in the maps with periodicity related\nto the cyclotron orbits of the scattering current. Stronger probe potentials\nprovide support to localized resonances at one of the sides of the junction\nwith current loops that interfere with the n-p junction currents. The\ninterference results in a series of narrow lines parallel to the junction with\npositions that strongly depend on the magnetic field through the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect. The consequences of a limited transparency of finite width n-p\njunctions are also discussed.\n", "  Herein we analyse late-time (post-plateau; 103 < t < 1229 d) optical spectra\nof low-redshift (z < 0.016), hydrogen-rich Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP). Our\nnewly constructed sample contains 91 nebular spectra of 38 SNe IIP, which is\nthe largest dataset of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the\nobjects have complementary photometric data. We determined the peak and total\nluminosity, velocity of the peak, HWHM intensity, and profile shape for many\nemission lines. Temporal evolution of these values and various flux ratios are\nstudied. We also investigate the correlations between these measurements and\nphotometric observables, such as the peak and plateau absolute magnitudes and\nthe late-time light curve decline rates in various optical bands. The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises\nfrom less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused\nby multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of\nthe explosion itself. Furthermore, if gamma-rays and positrons can escape more\neasily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more\nluminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger\nprogenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that\nis well-mixed with the hydrogen layer. In addition, we find a subset of objects\nwith evidence for asymmetric Ni-56 ejection, likely bipolar in shape. We also\ncompare our observations to theoretical late-time spectral models of SNe IIP\nfrom two separate groups and find moderate-to-good agreement with both sets of\nmodels. Our SNe IIP spectra are consistent with models of 12-15 M_Sun\nprogenitor stars having relatively low metallicity (Z $\\le$ 0.01).\n", "  We study supersymmetric (SUSY) models derived from the ten-dimensional SUSY\nYang- Mills theory compactified on magnetized orbifolds, with nonvanishing\nFayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms induced by magnetic fluxes in extra dimensions.\nAllowing the presence of FI-terms relaxes a constraint on flux configurations\nin SUSY model building based on magnetized backgrounds. In this case, charged\nfields develop their vacuum expectation values (VEVs) to cancel the FI-terms in\nthe D-flat directions of fluxed gauge symmetries, which break the gauge\nsymmetries and lead to a SUSY vacuum. Based on this idea, we propose a new\nclass of SUSY magnetized orbifold models with three generations of quarks and\nleptons. Especially, we construct a model where the right-handed sneutrinos\ndevelop their VEVs which restore the supersymmetry but yield lepton number\nviolating terms below the compactification scale, and show their\nphenomenological consequences.\n", "  We study in-medium spectral properties of charmonia in the vector and\npseudoscalar channels at nonzero momenta on quenched lattices, especially\nfocusing on their dispersion relation and weight of the peak. We measure the\nlattice Euclidean correlation functions with nonzero momenta on the anisotropic\nquenched lattices and study the spectral functions with the maximum entropy\nmethod. The dispersion relations of charmonia and the momentum dependence of\nthe weight of the peak are analyzed with the maximum entropy method together\nwith the errors estimated probabilistically in this method. We find significant\nincrease of the masses of charmonia in medium. It is also found that the\nfunctional form of the charmonium dispersion relations is not changed from that\nin the vacuum within the error even at $T\\simeq1.6T_c$ for all the channels we\nanalyzed.\n", "  Radio halos are diffuse synchrotron sources on scales of ~1 Mpc that are\nfound in merging clusters of galaxies, and are believed to be powered by\nelectrons re-accelerated by the merger-driven turbulence. We present\nmeasurements of extended radio emission on similarly large scales in two\nclusters of galaxies hosting cool cores: Abell 2390 and Abell 2261. The\nanalysis is based on interferometric imaging with the JVLA, VLA and GMRT. We\npresent detailed radio images of the targets, subtract the compact emission\ncomponents, and measure the spectral indices for the diffuse components. The\nradio emission in A2390 extends beyond a known sloshing-like brightness\ndiscontinuity, and has a very steep in-band spectral slope at 1.5 GHz that is\nsimilar to some known ultra-steep spectrum radio halos. The diffuse signal in\nA2261 is more extended than in A2390 but has lower luminosity. X-ray\nmorphological indicators, derived from XMM-Newton X-ray data, place these\nclusters in the category of relaxed or regular systems, although some\nasymmetric features that can indicate past minor mergers are seen in the X-ray\nbrightness images. If these two Mpc-scale radio sources are categorized as\ngiant radio halos, they question the common assumption of radio halos occurring\nexclusively in clusters undergoing violent merging activity, in addition to\ncommonly used criteria in distinguishing between radio halos and mini-halos.\n", "  We present the analysis performed on spectropolarimetric data of 97 O-type\ntargets included in the framework of the MiMeS (Magnetism in Massive Stars)\nSurvey. Mean Least-Squares Deconvolved Stokes I and V line profiles were\nextracted for each observation, from which we measured the radial velocity,\nrotational and non-rotational broadening velocities, and longitudinal magnetic\nfield. The investigation of the Stokes I profiles led to the discovery of 2 new\nmulti-line spectroscopic systems (HD46106, HD204827) and confirmed the presence\nof a suspected companion in HD37041. We present a modified strategy of the\nLeast-Squares Deconvolution technique aimed at optimising the detection of\nmagnetic signatures while minimising the detection of spurious signatures in\nStokes V. Using this analysis, we confirm the detection of a magnetic field in\n6 targets previously reported as magnetic by the MiMeS collaboration (HD108,\nHD47129A2, HD57682, HD148937, CPD-28 2561, and NGC 1624-2), as well as report\nthe presence of signal in Stokes V in 3 new magnetic candidates (HD36486,\nHD162978, HD199579). Overall, we find a magnetic incidence rate of 7+/-3%, for\n108 individual O stars (including all O-type components part of multi-line\nsystems), with a median uncertainty of the longitudinal field measurements of\nabout 50\\,G. An inspection of the data reveals no obvious biases affecting the\nincidence rate or the preference for detecting magnetic signatures in the\nmagnetic stars. Similar to A- and B-type stars, we find no link between the\nstars' physical properties (e.g. Teff, mass, age) and the presence of a\nmagnetic field. However, the Of?p stars represent a distinct class of magnetic\nO-type stars.\n", "  Using Chandra we have obtained imaging X-ray spectroscopy of the 10 to 16 Myr\nold F-star binary HD 113766. We individually resolve the binary components for\nthe first time in the X-ray and find a total 0.3 to 2.0 keV luminosity of\n2.2e29 erg/sec, consistent with previous RASS estimates. We find emission from\nthe easternmost, infrared-bright, dusty member HD 113766A to be only 10% that\nof the western, infrared-faint member HD 113766B. There is no evidence for a\n3rd late-type stellar or sub-stellar member of HD113766 with Lx > 6e25 erg s-1\nwithin 2 arcmin of the binary pair. The ratio of the two stars Xray luminosity\nis consistent with their assignments as F2V and F6V by Pecaut et al. (2012).\nThe emission is soft for both stars, kTApec = 0.30 to 0.50 keV, suggesting\nX-rays produced by stellar rotation and/or convection in young dynamos, but not\naccretion or outflow shocks which we rule out. A possible 2.8 +/- 0.15\n(2{\\sigma}) hr modulation in the HD 113766B X-ray emission is seen, but at very\nlow confidence and of unknown provenance. Stellar wind drag models\ncorresponding to Lx = 2e29 erg s-1 argue for a 1 mm dust particle lifetime\naround HD 113766B of only 90,0000 years, suggesting that dust around HD 113766B\nis quickly removed, whereas dust around HD 113766A can survive for > 1.5e6 yrs.\nAt 1e28 to 1e29 erg s-1 luminosity, astrobiologically important effects, like\ndust warming and X-ray photolytic organic synthesis, are likely for any\ncircumstellar material in the HD 113766 systems.\n", "  In this paper, we show that a rigidly rotating string can extract the\nrotational energy from a rotating black hole. We consider Nambu-Goto strings\nstationary with respect to a corotating Killing vector with an uniform angular\nvelocity $\\omega$ in the Kerr spacetime. We show that a necessary condition of\nthe energy-extraction process is that an effective horizon on the string world\nsheet, which corresponds to the inner light surface, is inside the ergosphere\nof the Kerr black hole and the angular velocity $\\omega$ is less than that of\nthe black hole $\\Omega_\\mathrm{h}$. Furthermore, we discuss global\nconfigurations of such strings in both of a slow-rotation limit and the\nextremal Kerr case.\n", "  The Square Kilometre Array (SKA), when it becomes functional, is expected to\nenrich neutron star (NS) catalogues by at least an order of magnitude over\ntheir current state. This includes the discovery of new NS objects leading to\nbetter sampling of under-represented NS categories, precision measurements of\nintrinsic properties such as spin period and magnetic field, as also data on\nrelated phenomena such as microstructure, nulling, glitching, etc. This will\npresent a unique opportunity to seek answers to interesting and fundamental\nquestions about the extreme physics underlying these exotic objects in the\nuniverse. In this paper, we first present a meta-analysis (from a\nmethodological viewpoint) of statistical analyses performed using existing NS\ndata, with a two-fold goal: First, this should bring out how statistical models\nand methods are shaped and dictated by the science problem being addressed.\nSecond, it is hoped that these analyses will provide useful starting points for\ndeeper analyses involving richer data from SKA whenever it becomes available.\nWe also describe a few other areas of NS science which we believe will benefit\nfrom SKA which are of interest to the Indian NS community.\n", "  Quiescent prominences host a diverse range of flows, including\nRayleigh-Taylor instability driven upflows and impulsive downflows, and so it\nis no surprise that turbulent motions also exist. As prominences are believed\nto have a mean horizontal guide field, investigating any turbulence they host\ncould shed light on the nature of MHD turbulence in a wide range of\nastrophysical systems. In this paper we have investigated the nature of the\nturbulent prominence motions using structure function analysis on the velocity\nincrements estimated from H$\\alpha$ Dopplergrams constructed with observational\ndata from Hinode SOT. The pdf of the velocity increments shows that as we look\nat increasingly small spatial separations the distribution displays greater\ndeparture from a reference Gaussian distribution, hinting at intermittency in\nthe velocity field. Analysis of the even order structure functions for both the\nhorizontal and vertical separations showed the existence of two distinct\nregions displaying different exponents of the power law with the break in the\npower law at approximately 2000km. We hypothesise this to be a result of\ninternal turbulence excited in the prominence by the dynamic flows of the\nsystem found at this spatial scale. We found that the scaling exponents of the\np-th order structure functions for these two regions generally followed the p/2\n(smaller scales) and p/4 (larger scales) laws that are the same as those\npredicted for weak MHD turbulence and Kraichnan-Iroshnikov turbulence\nrespectively. However, the existence of the p/4 scaling at larger scales than\nthe p/2 scaling is inconsistent with the increasing nonlinearity expected in\nMHD turbulence. Estimating the heating from the turbulent energy dissipation\nshowed that this turbulent heating would be very inefficient, but that the mass\ndiffusion through turbulence driven reconnection was of the order of\n$10^{10}$cm$^2$/s.\n", "  Based on stellar evolution simulations, we demonstrate that rapidly accreting\nwhite dwarfs in close binary systems are an astrophysical site for the\nintermediate neutron-capture process. During recurrent and very strong He-shell\nflashes in the stable H-burning accretion regime H-rich material enters the\nHe-shell flash convection zone. $^{12}$C(p,$\\gamma)^{13}$N reactions release\nenough energy to potentially impact convection, and i process is activated\nthrough the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. The H-ingestion flash may\nnot cause a split of the convection zone as it was seen in simulations of\nHe-shell flashes in post-AGB and low-Z AGB stars. We estimate that for the\nproduction of first-peak heavy elements this site can be of similar importance\nfor galactic chemical evolution as the s-process production by low-mass AGB\nstars. The He-shell flashes result in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection\nof the accreted and then i-process enriched material, via super-Eddington\nluminosity winds or Roche-lobe overflow. The white dwarf models do not retain\nany significant amount of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of\n$\\leq 10\\%$ depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions. This\nmakes the evolutionary path of such systems to supernova Ia explosion highly\nunlikely.\n", "  The near-infrared (NIR) optical pumped photophysics of nitrogen vacancy (NV)\ncenter in diamond was experimentally studied by considering both the charge\nstate conversion and stimulated emission. We found that the NIR laser can help\nto highly enhance the charge state conversion rate, which can be applied to\nimprove the performance of charge state depletion nanoscopy. Using a\ndoughnut-shaped visible laser beam and a Gaussian-shaped NIR laser beam for\ncharge state manipulation, we developed a low power charge state depletion\nnanoscopy for NV center. A spatial resolution of 14 nm was achieved with the\ndepletion laser intensity approximately three orders lower than that used for\nthe stimulated emission depletion nanoscopy with NV center. With high spatial\nresolution and low laser power, the nanoscopy can be used for nanoscale quantum\nsensing with NV center. And our study on the charge state conversion can help\nto further optimize the NV center spin state initialization and detection.\n", "  Detection of nano-mechanical displacement by transport techniques has reached\nhigh level of sensitivity and versatility. In order to detect the amplitude of\noscillation of nano-mechanical oscillator a widely used technique consists to\ncouple this motion capacitively to a single-electron transistor and to detect\nthe high-frequency modulation of the current through the non-linear mixing with\nan electric signal at a slighltly detuned frequency. The method known as\ncurrent-mixing technique is employed in particular for the detection of\nsuspended carbon nanotubes. In this paper we study theoretically the limiting\nconditions on the sensitivity of this method. The sensitivity is increased by\nincreasing the response function to the signal, but also by reducing the noise.\nFor these reasons we study systematically the response function, the effect of\ncurrent-and displacement-fluctuations, and finally the case where the\ntunnelling rate of the electrons are of the same order or larger of the\nresonating frequency. We find thus upper bounds to the sensitivity of the\ndetection technique.\n", "  We report the detection of the Zeeman effect in the 44 GHz Class I methanol\nmaser line toward the star forming region DR21(OH). In a 219 Jy/beam maser\ncentered at an LSR velocity of 0.83 km s$^{-1}$, we find a 20-$\\sigma$\ndetection of $zB_{\\text{los}} = 53.5 \\pm 2.7$ Hz. If 44 GHz methanol masers are\nexcited at $n \\sim 10^{7-8}$ cm$^{-3}$, then the $B~vs.~n^{1/2}$ relation would\nimply from comparison with Zeeman effect detections in the CN($1-0$) line\ntoward DR21(OH) that magnetic fields traced by 44 GHz methanol masers in\nDR21(OH) should be $\\sim$10 mG. Together with our detected $zB_{\\text{los}} =\n53.5$ Hz, this would imply that the value of the 44 GHz methanol Zeeman\nsplitting factor $z$ is $\\sim$5 Hz mG$^{-1}$. Such small values of $z$ would\nnot be a surprise, as the methanol molecule is non paramagnetic, like H$_2$O.\nEmpirical attempts to determine $z$, as demonstrated, are important because\ncurrently there are no laboratory measurements or theoretically calculated\nvalues of $z$ for the 44 GHz methanol transition. Data from observations of a\nlarger number of sources are needed to make such empirical determinations\nrobust.\n", "  We present a fully relativistic investigation of the radiative recombination\nof a twisted electron with a bare heavy nucleus. The twisted electron is\ndescribed by the wave function which accounts for the interaction with the\nnucleus in all orders in $\\alpha Z$. We use this wave function to derive the\nprobability of the radiative recombination with a single ion being shifted from\nthe twisted electron propagation direction. We also consider more realistic\nexperimental scenarios where the target is either localized (mesoscopic) or\ninfinitely wide (macroscopic). The situation when the incident electron is a\ncoherent superposition of two vortex states is considered as well. For the\nnonrelativistic case we present analytical expressions which support our\nnumerical calculations. We study in details the influence of the electron\ntwistedness on the polarization and angular distribution of the emitted photon.\nIt is found that these properties of the outgoing photon might be very\nsensitive to the total angular momentum and kinematic properties of twisted\nbeams. Therefore, the recombination of the twisted electrons can serve as a\nvaluable tool for atomic investigations as well as for the diagnostics of the\nvortex electron beams.\n", "  We discuss the environment of local hard X-ray selected active galaxies, with\nreference to two independent group catalogues. We find that the fraction of\nthese AGN in S0 host galaxies decreases strongly as a function of galaxy group\nsize (halo mass) - which contrasts with the increasing fraction of galaxies of\nS0 type in denser environments. However, there is no evidence for an\nenvironmental dependence of AGN in spiral galaxies. Because most AGN are found\nin spiral galaxies, this dilutes the signature of environmental dependence for\nthe population as a whole. We argue that the differing results for AGN in\ndisk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies is related to the source of the gas\nfuelling the AGN, and so may also impact the luminosity function, duty cycle,\nand obscuration. We find that there is a significant difference in the\nluminosity function for AGN in spiral and S0 galaxies, and tentative evidence\nfor some difference in the fraction of obscured AGN.\n", "  A distant, as yet unseen ninth planet has been invoked to explain various\nobservations of the outer solar system. While such a 'Planet Nine', if it\nexists, is most likely to be discovered via reflected light in the optical, it\nmay emit much more strongly at 3$-$5$\\mu$m than simple blackbody predictions\nwould suggest, depending on its atmospheric properties (Fortney et al. 2016).\nAs a result, Planet Nine may be detectable at 3.4$\\mu$m with WISE, but single\nexposures are too shallow except at relatively small distances ($d_9 \\lesssim\n430$ AU). We develop a method to search for Planet Nine far beyond the W1\nsingle-exposure sensitivity, to distances as large as 800 AU, using inertial\ncoadds of W1 exposures binned into $\\sim$1 day intervals. We apply our\nmethodology to $\\sim$2000 square degrees of sky identified by Holman & Payne\n(2016) as a potentially likely Planet Nine location, based on the Fienga et al.\n(2016) Cassini ranging analysis. We do not detect a plausible Planet Nine\ncandidate, but are able to derive a detailed completeness curve, ruling out its\npresence within the parameter space searched at $W1 < 16.66$ (90%\ncompleteness). Our method uses all publicly available W1 imaging, spanning 2010\nJanuary to 2015 December, and will become more sensitive with future\nNEOWISE-Reactivation releases of additional W1 exposures. We anticipate that\nour method will be applicable to the entire high Galactic latitude sky, and we\nwill extend our search to that full footprint in the near future.\n", "  Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHs) are expected to result from galaxy\nmergers, and thus are natural byproducts (and probes) of hierarchical structure\nformation in the Universe. They are also the primary expected source of\nlow-frequency gravitational wave emission. We search for binary BHs using\ntime-variable velocity shifts in broad Mg II emission lines of quasars with\nmulti-epoch observations. First, we inspect velocity shifts of the binary SMBH\ncandidates identified in Ju et al. (2013), using SDSS spectra with an\nadditional epoch of data that lengthens the typical baseline to ~10 yr. We find\nvariations in the line-of-sight velocity shifts over 10 years that are\ncomparable to the shifts observed over 1-2 years, ruling out the binary model\nfor the bulk of our candidates. We then analyze 1438 objects with 8 yr median\ntime baselines, from which we would expect to see velocity shifts >1000 km/s\nfrom sub-pc binaries. We find only one object with an outlying velocity of 448\nkm/s, indicating, based on our modeling, that ~< 1 per cent (the value varies\nwith different assumptions) of SMBHs that are active as quasars reside in\nbinaries with ~0.1 pc separations. Binaries either sweep through these small\nseparations rapidly or stall at larger radii.\n", "  By assuming the spatially flat~FLRW line-element and employing the\nHamiltonian formalism, a noncommutative (NC) setting of the Brans-Dicke (BD)\ntheory is introduced. We investigate gravity-driven acceleration and kinetic\ninflation in this NC BD cosmology. Despite to the commutative case, in which\nboth the scale factor and BD scalar field are obtained in power-law forms (in\nterms of the cosmic time), in our herein NC model, we see that the power-law\nscalar factor is multiplied by a dynamical exponential warp factor. This warp\nfactor depends on not only the NC parameter but also the momentum conjugate\nassociated to the BD scalar field. For very small values of this parameter, we\nobtain an appropriate inflationary solution, which can overcome the problems\nwithin the standard BD cosmology in a more efficient manner. Moreover, we see\nthat a graceful exit from an early acceleration epoch towards a decelerating\nradiation epoch is provided. For late times, due to the presence of the NC\nparameter, we obtain a zero acceleration epoch, which can be interpreted as the\ncoarse-grained explanation.\n", "  We propose a scheme to read out the spin of a single electron quantum bit in\na surface Paul trap using oscillating magnetic field gradients. The readout\nsequence is composed of cooling, driving, amplification and detection of the\nelectron's motion. We study the scheme in the presence of noise and trap\nanharmonicities at liquid helium temperatures. An analysis of the the four\nprocedures shows short measurement times ($25~\\mu$s) and high fidelities\n($99.7\\%$) are achievable with realistic experimental parameters. Our scheme\nperforms the function of fluorescence detection in ion trapping schemes,\nhighlighting the potential to built all-electric quantum computers based on\ntrapped electron spin qubits.\n", "  We report the detection of the secondary eclipse of HAT-P-11 b, a\nNeptune-sized planet orbiting an active K4 dwarf. Using all available\nshort-cadence data of the Kepler mission, we derive refined planetary ephemeris\nincreasing their precision by more than an order of magnitude. Our simultaneous\nprimary and secondary transit modeling results in improved transit and orbital\nparameters. In particular, the precise timing of the secondary eclipse allows\nto pin down the orbital eccentricity to $0.26459_{-0.00048}^{+0.00069}$. The\nsecondary eclipse depth of $6.09_{-1.11}^{+1.12}$ ppm corresponds to a\n$5.5\\sigma$ detection and results in a geometric albedo of $0.39\\pm0.07$ for\nHAT-P-11 b, close to Neptune's value, which may indicate further resemblances\nbetween these two bodies. Due to the substantial orbital eccentricity, the\nplanetary equilibrium temperature is expected to change significantly with\norbital position and ought to vary between $630^\\circ$ K and $950^\\circ$ K,\ndepending on the details of heat redistribution in the atmosphere of HAT-P-11\nb.\n", "  Physical principles constraints the way nonlocal correlations can be\ndistributed among distant parties in a Bell-type experiment. These constraints\nare usually expressed by monogamy relations that bound the amount of Bell\ninequality violation observed by a set of parties by the violation observed by\na different set of parties. Here we show that the no-signaling principle yields\na simple and tight monogamy relations for an important class of bipartite and\nmultipartite Bell inequalities. We also link these trade-offs to the guessing\nprobability--a key quantity in the device-independent information processing.\n", "  We present an extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaign of 29 strong lensing\n(SL) selected galaxy clusters discovered primarily in the Second Red-Sequence\nCluster Survey (RCS-2). Our spectroscopic analysis yields redshifts for 52\ngravitational arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters, which correspond\nto 35 distinct background sources that are clearly distorted by the\ngravitational potential of these clusters. These lensed galaxies span a wide\nredshift range of $0.8 \\le z \\le 2.9$, with a median redshift of $z_s = 1.8 \\pm\n0.1 $. We also measure reliable redshifts for 1004 cluster members, allowing us\nto obtain robust velocity dispersion measurements for 23 of these clusters,\nwhich we then use to determine their dynamical masses by using a\nsimulation-based $\\sigma_{DM} - M_{200}$ scaling relation. The redshift and\nmass ranges covered by our SL sample are $0.22 \\le z \\le 1.01$ and $5\n\\times10^{13} \\le M_{200}/h^{-1}_{70}M_{\\odot} \\le 1.9\\times10^{15}$,\nrespectively. We analyze and quantify some possible effects that might bias our\nmass estimates, such as the presence of substructure, the region where cluster\nmembers are selected for spectroscopic follow-up, the final number of confirmed\nmembers, and line-of-sight effects. We find that 10 clusters of our sample with\n$N_{mem} \\gtrsim 20$ show signs of dynamical substructure. However, the\nvelocity data of only one system is inconsistent with a uni-modal distribution.\nWe therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and not of\ncomparable size to the clusters themselves. Consequently, our velocity\ndispersion and mass estimates can be used as priors for SL mass reconstruction\nstudies and also represent an important step toward a better understanding of\nthe properties of the SL galaxy cluster population.\n", "  We present HI 21cm and optical observations of UGC 3672 which is located near\nthe centre of the nearby Lynx-Cancer void. We find that UGC 3672 consists of an\napproximately linearly aligned triplet of gas rich dwarfs with large scale\nvelocity continuity along the triplet axis. The faintest component of the\ntriplet is extremely gas-rich (MHI/LB ~ 17) and also extremely metal deficient\n(12+log(O/H) ~ 7.0). The metallicity of this dwarf is close to the 'floor'\nobserved in star forming galaxies. Low resolution HI images show that the\ngalaxy triplet is located inside a common HI envelope, with fairly regular,\ndisk like kinematics. At high angular resolution however, the gas is found to\nbe confined to several filamentary tidal tails and bridges. The linear\nalignment of the galaxies, along with the velocity continuity that we observe,\nis consistent with the galaxies lying along a filament. We argue that the\nlocation of this highly unusual system in an extremely low density environment\nis not a coincidence, but is a consequence of structure formation proceeding\nmore slowly and also probing smaller scales than in regions with average\ndensity. Our observations also indicate that wet mergers of galaxies flowing\nalong filaments is a possible pathway for the formation of gas rich disks. The\nUGC 3672 system provides an interesting opportunity to study the kind of\ninteractions typical between high redshift extremely gas rich unevolved small\nsystems that lie at base of the hierarchical galaxy formation model.\n", "  The band-unfolding method is widely used to calculate the effective band\nstructures of a disordered system from its supercell model. The unfolded band\nstructures show the crystallographic symmetry of the underlying structure,\nwhere the difference of chemical components and the local atomic relaxation are\nignored. It has been, however, still difficult to decompose the unfolded band\nstructures into the modes based on the crystallographic symmetry of the\nunderlying structure, and therefore detailed analyses of the unfolded band\nstructures have been restricted. In this study, we develop a procedure to\ndecompose the unfolded band structures according to the small representations\n(SRs) of the little groups. For this purpose, we derive the projection\noperators for SRs based on the group representation theory. We also introduce\nanother type of projection operators for chemical elements, which enables us to\ndecompose the unfolded band structures into the contributions of different\ncombinations of chemical elements. Using the current method, we investigate the\nphonon band structure of disordered face-centered cubic Cu0.75Au0.25, which has\nlarge variations of atomic masses and force constants among the atomic sites\ndue to the chemical disorder. We find several peculiar behaviors such as\ndiscontinuous and split branches in the unfolded phonon band structure. They\nare found to occur because different combinations of the chemical elements\ncontribute to different regions of frequency.\n", "  I suggest that the main process that amplifies magnetic fields in cooling\nflows in clusters and group of galaxies is a jet-driven dynamo (JEDD). The main\nprocesses that are behind the JEDD is the turbulence that is formed by the many\nvortices formed in the inflation processes of bubbles, and the large scale\nshear formed by the propagating jet. It is sufficient that a strong turbulence\nexits in the vicinity of the jets and bubbles, just where the shear is large.\nThe typical amplification time of magnetic fields by the JEDD near the jets and\nbubbles is approximately hundred million years. The amplification time in the\nentire cooling flow region is somewhat longer. The vortices that create the\nturbulence are those that also transfer energy from the jets to the\nintra-cluster medium, by mixing shocked jet gas with the intra-cluster medium\ngas, and by exciting sound waves. The JEDD model adds magnetic fields to the\ncyclical behavior of energy and mass in the jet-feedback mechanism (JFM) in\ncooling flows.\n", "  As well known, spacelike proton form factors expressed in the Breit frame may\nbe interpreted as the Fourier transform of static space distributions of\nelectric charge and current. In particular, the electric form factor is simply\nthe Fourier transform of the charge distribution $F(q)=\\int e^{i\\vec q \\cdot\n\\vec r} \\rho(r)d^3r$. We don't have an intuitive interpretation of the same\nlevel of simplicity for the proton timelike form factor appearing in the\nreactions $e^+e^-\\leftrightarrow \\bar{p}p$. However, one may suggest that in\nthe center of mass (CM) frame, where $q_\\mu x^\\mu =qt$, a timelike electric\nform factor is the Fourier transform $F(q) =\\int e^{iqt} R(t)dt$ of a function\n$R(t)$ expressing how the electric properties of the forming (or annihilating)\nproton-antiproton pair evolve in time. Here we analyze in depth this idea, show\nthat the functions $\\rho(r)$ and $R(t)$ can be formally written as the time and\nspace integrals of a unique correlation function depending on both time and\nspace coordinates.\n", "  We consider driven many-particle models which have a phase transition between\nan active and an absorbing phase. Like previously studied models, we have\nparticle conservation, but here we introduce an additional symmetry - when two\nparticles interact, we give them stochastic kicks which conserve center of\nmass. We find that the density fluctuations in the active phase decay in the\nfastest manner possible for a disordered isotropic system, and we present\narguments that the large scale fluctuations are determined by a competition\nbetween a noise term which generates fluctuations, and a deterministic term\nwhich reduces them. Our results may be relevant to shear experiments and may\nfurther the understanding of hyperuniformity which occurs at the critical\npoint.\n", "  Spectral-timing products of kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs)\nin low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems, including energy- and\nfrequency-dependent lags, have been analyzed previously in 4U 1608-52, 4U\n1636-53, and 4U 1728-34. Here, we study the spectral-timing properties of the\nlower kHz QPO of the neutron star LMXB Aquila X-1 for the first time. We\ncompute broadband energy lags, as well as energy-dependent lags and the\ncovariance spectrum using data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). We\nfind very similar characteristics to other previously studied systems,\nincluding soft lags of $\\sim$30 $\\mu$s between the 3.0 - 8.0 keV and 8.0 - 20.0\nkeV energy bands at the average QPO frequency. We also find lags that show a\nnearly monotonic trend with energy, with the highest energy photons arriving\nfirst. The covariance spectrum of the lower kHz QPO is well fit by a thermal\nComptonization model, though we find a higher seed photon temperature compared\nto the mean spectrum, which was also seen in Peille et al., (2015), and\nindicates the possibility of a composite boundary layer emitting region.\nLastly, we see in one set of observations, an Fe K component in the covariance\nspectrum at 2.4-$\\sigma$ confidence which may raise questions about the role of\nreverberation in the production of lags.\n", "  The basic features of quark and lepton mass matrices can be successfully\nexplained by natural minima of a generic potential with dynamical Yukawa fields\ninvariant under the $[\\mathrm{SU(3)}]^5\\times \\mathcal{O}(3)$ flavor symmetry.\nIf this symmetry is gauged, in order to avoid potentially dangerous Goldstone\nbosons, and small perturbations are added to exactly fit the observed pattern\nof fermion masses, the spectrum of massive flavor gauge bosons can naturally\nexplain the hints for new physics in $b\\to s \\ell^+\\ell^-$ transitions,\nincluding $R_K$. In particular, the desired pattern of the Standard Model\nYukawa couplings is compatible with a gauged $\\mathrm{U(1)}_q$ in the quark\nsector, and $\\mathrm{U(1)}_{\\mu-\\tau}$ in the lepton sector spontaneously\nbroken around the TeV scale. In order to explain the aforementioned\nexperimental hints, the corresponding neutral gauge bosons are required to mix,\nyielding to potentially observable signals in dimuon resonance searches at the\nLHC.\n", "  During its strong outburst of 2015 June/July, the X-ray transient V404 Cygni\n(= GS2023+338) was observed up to a level of 50 Crab in the hard X-ray domain.\nWe focus here on a particularly intense episode preceeding a definitive decline\nof the source activity. We benefit from large signal-to-noise ratios to\ninvestigate the source spectral variability on a timescale of 5 minutes. A\nHardness-Intensity study of three broad bands reveals clearly different\nbehaviors at low and high energy (below and above around 100 keV). In\nparticular, on two occasions, the source intensity varies by a factor of 3-4 in\namplitude while keeping the same spectral shape. On the other hand, at the end\nof the major flare, the emission presents a clear anticorrelation between flux\nand hardness. These behaviors strongly suggest the presence of two spectral\ncomponents related to emission processes varying in a largely independent way.\nThe first component (E < 100-150 keV) is classically identified with a\nComptonizing thermal electron population and requires either an unusual seed\nphoton population or a specific geometry with strong absorbing/reflecting\nmaterial. The second component is modeled by a cutoff power-law, which could\ncorrespond to a second hotter Comptonizing population or another mechanism\n(synchrotron, non-thermal Comptonization...). In the framework of such a model,\nHardness-Intensity and Flux-Flux diagrams clearly demonstrate that the source\nevolution follows a well organized underlying scheme. They reveal unique\ninformation about the Hard X-ray emission processes and connections between\nthem.\n", "  In presence of Gauss-Bonnet corrections, we study anisotropic inflation aided\nby a massless $SU(2)$ gauge field where both the gauge field and the\nGauss-Bonnet term are non-minimally coupled to the inflaton. In this scenario,\nunder slow-roll approximations, the anisotropic inflation is realized as an\nattractor solution with quadratic forms of inflaton potential and Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling function. We show that the degree of anisotropy is proportional to the\nadditive combination of two slow-roll parameters of the theory. The anisotropy\nmay become either positive or negative similar to the non-Gauss-Bonnet\nframework, a feature of the model for anisotropic inflation supported by a\nnon-abelian gauge field but the effect of Gauss-Bonnet term further enhances or\nsuppresses the generated anisotropy.\n", "  A hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf (WD) -- an unburned C/O core surrounded by an\nO/Ne/Na mantle -- can be formed if the carbon flame is quenched in a super-AGB\n(SAGB) star or white dwarf merger remnant. We show that this segregated hybrid\nstructure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of\nWD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,\nresulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\\rm e}$) in the regions\nprocessed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne\nmantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient\nmixing. We use the results of $\\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O\ncores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool.\nIn all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on\ntimescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar\nmass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\\rm\nCh}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than\nassumed thus far. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for the\npossibility of Type Ia supernovae from hybrid WDs.\n", "  We characterize the optical variability of quasars in the intermediate\nPalomar Transient Factory (iPTF) and Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) surveys.\nWe re-calibrate the $r$-band light curves for $\\sim$28,000 luminous, broad-line\nAGNs from the SDSS, producing a total of $\\sim$2.4 million photometric data\npoints. We utilize both the structure function (SF) and power spectrum density\n(PSD) formalisms to search for links between the optical variability and the\nphysical parameters of the accreting supermassive black holes that power the\nquasars. The excess variance (SF$^{2}$) of the quasar sample tends to zero at\nvery short time separations, validating our re-calibration of the time-series\ndata. We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval,\nor equivalently the time-scale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is\nmost strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black\nhole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF($\\tau$)=0.07 mag, the\ntime-scale has a dependency of $\\tau \\propto L^{0.4}$. This is broadly\nconsistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model,\nwhich provides $\\tau \\propto L^{0.5}$. The PSD analysis also reveals that many\nquasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a\ncorrelation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction\nof slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the\npossibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect.\nThis effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (i)PTF data, and in a PSD\nanalysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.\n", "  We report chemical abundances obtained by SDSS-III/APOGEE for giant stars in\nfive globular clusters located within 2.2 kpc of the Galactic centre. We detect\nthe presence of multiple stellar populations in four of those clusters (NGC\n6553, NGC 6528, Terzan 5, and Palomar 6) and find strong evidence for their\npresence in NGC 6522. All clusters present a significant spread in the\nabundances of N, C, Na, and Al, with the usual correlations and\nanti-correlations between various abundances seen in other globular clusters.\nOur results provide important quantitative constraints on theoretical models\nfor self-enrichment of globular clusters, by testing their predictions for the\ndependence of yields of elements such as Na, N, C, and Al on metallicity. They\nalso confirm that, under the assumption that field N-rich stars originate from\nglobular cluster destruction, they can be used as tracers of their parental\nsystems in the high- metallicity regime.\n", "  A model of fast radio bursts, which enlists young, short period extragalactic\nmagnetars satisfying $B/P > 2 \\times 10^{16}$~G~s$^{-1}$ (1~G =\n1~statvolt~cm$^{-1}$) as the source, is proposed. When the parallel component\n$\\bE_\\parallel$ of the surface electric field (under the scenario of a vacuum\nmagnetosphere) of such pulsars approaches 5 \\% of the critical field $E_c =\nm_e^2 c^3/(e\\hbar)$, in strength, the field can readily decay via the Schwinger\nmechanism into electron-positron pairs, the back reaction of which causes\n$\\bE_\\parallel$ to oscillate on a characteristic timescale smaller than the\ndevelopment of a spark gap. Thus, under this scenario, the open field line\nregion of the pulsar magnetosphere is controlled by Schwinger pairs, and their\nlarge creation and acceleration rates enable the escaping pairs to coherently\nemit radio waves directly from the polar cap. The majority of the energy is\nemitted at frequencies $\\lesssim 1$~GHz where the coherent radiation has the\nhighest yield, at a rate large enough to cause the magnetar to lose spin\nsignificantly over timescale $\\ap$ a few $\\times 10^{-3}$~s, the duration of a\nfast radio burst. Owing to circumstellar environment of a young magnetar,\nhowever, the $\\lesssim 1$~GHz radiation is likely to be absorbed or reflected\nby the overlying matter. It is shown that the brightness of the remaining\n(observable) frequencies of $\\ap 1$~GHz and above are on par with a typical\nfast radio burst. Unless some spin-up mechanism is available to recover the\noriginal high rotation rate that triggered the Schwinger mechanism, the fast\nradio burst will not be repeated again in the same magnetar.\n", "  The resistance coefficients in screen Coulomb potential of stellar plasma are\nevaluated in high accuracy. I have analyzed the possible singularities in the\nintegral of scattering angle. There are possible singularities in the case of\nattractive potential. This may result in problem for numerical integral. In\norder to avoid the problem, I have used a proper scheme, e.g., splitting into\nmany subintervals and the width of each subinterval is determined by the\nvariation of the integrand, to calculate the scattering angle. The collision\nintegrals are calculated by using Romberg's method therefore the accuracy is\nhigh (i.e., $ \\sim 10^{-12}$). The results of collision integrals and their\nderivatives in $-12 \\leq \\psi \\leq 5$ are listed. By using Hermite polynomial\ninterpolation from those data, the collision integrals can be obtained with an\naccuracy of $10^{-10}$. For very weak coupled plasma ($\\psi \\geq 4.5$),\nanalytical fittings for collision integrals are available with an accuracy of\n$10^{-11}$. I have compared the final results of resistance coefficients with\nother works and found that, for repulsive potential, the results are basically\nsame to others, for attractive potential, the results in intermediate and\nstrong coupled case show significant differences. The resulting resistance\ncoefficients are tested in the solar model. Comparing with the widely used Cox\net al.(1989) and Thoul et al. (1994) models, the resistance coefficients in\nscreen Coulomb potential leads to a little weaker effect in solar model, which\nis contrary to the expectation of attempts to solve the solar abundance\nproblem.\n", "  We present a theoretical investigation for the full counting statistics of\nthe Andreev tunneling through a quantum dot (QD) embedded between\nsuperconducting (SC) and normal leads in the presence of a strong on-site\nelectron-phonon interaction using nonequilibrium Green function method. For\nthis purpose, we generalize the dressed tunneling approximation (DTA) recently\ndeveloped in dealing with inelastic tunneling in a normal QD system to the\nAndreev transport issue, which takes account of vibrational effect in\nevaluation of electronic tunneling self energy in comparison with other simple\napproaches and meanwhile allows us to derive an explicit analytical formula for\nthe cumulant generating function at the subgap region. We then analyze the\ninterplay of polaronic and SC proximity effects on the Andreev reflection\nspectrum, current-voltage characteristics, and current fluctuations of the\nhybrid system. Our main findings include: (1) no phonon side peaks in the\nlinear Andreev conductance; (2) a negative differential conductance stemming\nfrom the suppressed Andreev reflection spectrum; (3) a novel inelastic resonant\npeak in the differential conductance due to phonon assisted Andreev reflection;\n(4) enhancement or suppression of shot noise for the symmetric or asymmetric\ntunnel-coupling system respectively.\n", "  Radio observations of young stellar objects (YSOs) enable the study of\nionised plasma outflows from young protostars via their free-free radiation.\nPrevious studies of the low-mass young system T Tau have used radio\nobservations to model the spectrum and estimate important physical properties\nof the associated ionised plasma (local electron density, ionised gas content\nand emission measure). However, without an indication of the low-frequency\nturnover in the free-free spectrum, these properties remain difficult to\nconstrain. This paper presents the detection of T Tau at 149 MHz with the Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR) - the first time a YSO has been observed at such low\nfrequencies. The recovered total flux indicates that the free-free spectrum may\nbe turning over near 149 MHz. The spectral energy distribution is fitted and\nyields improved constraints on local electron density ($(7.2 \\pm\n2.1)\\times10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), ionised gas mass ($(1.0 \\pm 1.8)\\times10^{-6}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) and emission measure ($(1.67 \\pm 0.14)\\times10^5$ pc cm$^{-6}$).\n", "  We present results of deep 153 ks Chandra observations of the hot, 11 keV,\ngalaxy cluster associated with the radio galaxy 3C 438. By mapping the\nmorphology of the hot gas and analyzing its surface brightness and temperature\ndistributions, we demonstrate the presence of a merger bow shock. We identify\nthe presence of two jumps in surface brightness and in density located at\n$\\sim$400 kpc and $\\sim$800 kpc from the cluster's core. At the position of the\ninner jump, we detect a factor of $2.3\\pm 0.2$ density jump, while at the\nlocation of the outer jump, we detect a density drop of a factor of $3.5 \\pm\n0.7$. Combining this with the temperature distribution within the cluster, we\nestablish that the pressure of the hot gas is continuous at the 400 kpc jump,\nwhile there is a factor of $6.2 \\pm 2.8$ pressure discontinuity at 800 kpc\njump. From the magnitude of the outer pressure discontinuity, using the\nRankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, we determine that the sub-cluster is moving\nat $M = 2.3\\pm 0.5$, or approximately $2600\\pm 565$ km/s through the\nsurrounding intracluster medium, creating the conditions for a bow shock. Based\non these findings, we conclude that the pressure discontinuity is likely the\nresult of an ongoing major merger between two massive clusters. Since few\nobservations of bow shocks in clusters have been made, this detection can\ncontribute to the study of the dynamics of cluster mergers, which offers\ninsight on how the most massive clusters may have formed.\n", "  Stellar astrophysicists are increasingly taking into account the effects of\norbiting companions on stellar evolution. New discoveries, many thanks to\nsystematic time-domain surveys, have underlined the role of binary star\ninteractions in a range of astrophysical events, including some that were\npreviously interpreted as due uniquely to single stellar evolution. Here, we\nreview classical binary phenomena such as type Ia supernovae, and discuss new\nphenomena such as intermediate luminosity transients, gravitational\nwave-producing double black holes, or the interaction between stars and their\nplanets. Finally, we examine the reassessment of well-known phenomena in light\nof interpretations that include both single and binary stars, for example\nsupernovae of type Ib and Ic or luminous blue variables. At the same time we\ncontextualise the new discoveries within the framework and nomenclature of the\ncorpus of knowledge on binary stellar evolution. The last decade has heralded\nan era of revival in stellar astrophysics as the complexity of stellar\nobservations is increasingly interpreted with an interplay of single and binary\nscenarios. The next decade, with the advent of massive projects such as the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Square Kilometre Array, the James Webb\nSpace Telescope and increasingly sophisticated computational methods, will see\nthe birth of an expanded framework of stellar evolution that will have\nrepercussions in many other areas of astrophysics such as galactic evolution\nand nucleosynthesis.\n", "  The missing historical record of the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova (SN)\nevent implies a large extinction to the SN, possibly greater than the\ninterstellar extinction to the current SN remnant. Here we investigate the\npossibility that the guest star that appeared near Cas A in 1592--1593 in\nKorean history books could have been an `impostor' of the Cas A SN, i.e., a\nluminous transient that appeared to be a SN but did not destroy the progenitor\nstar, with strong mass loss to have provided extra circumstellar extinction. We\nfirst review the Korean records and show that a spatial coincidence between the\nguest star and Cas A cannot be ruled out, as opposed to previous studies. Based\non modern astrophysical findings on core-collapse SN, we argue that Cas A could\nhave had an impostor and derive its anticipated properties. It turned out that\nthe Cas A SN impostor must have been bright ($M_V =-14.7 \\pm 2.2$ mag) and an\namount of dust with visual extinction of $\\ge 2.8\\pm 2.2 $ mag should have\nformed in the ejected envelope and/or in a strong wind afterwards. The mass\nloss needs to have been spherically asymmetric in order to see the light echo\nfrom the SN event but not the one from the impostor event.\n", "  The double exchange model describing interactions of itinerant electrons with\nlocalized spins is usually used to explain ferromagnetism in metals. We show\nthat for a variety of crystal lattices of different dimensionalities and for a\nwide range of model parameters the ferromagnetic state is unstable against a\nnon-collinear spiral magnetic order. We revisit the phase diagram of the double\nexchange model on a triangular lattice and show in a large part of the diagram\nthe incommensurate spiral state has a lower energy than the previously\ndiscussed commensurate states. These results indicate that double exchange\nsystems are inherently frustrated and can host unconventional spin orders.\n", "  Using multi-epoch VLA observations, covering a time baseline of 29.1 years,\nwe have measured the proper motions of 88 young stars with compact radio\nemission in the core of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and the neighboring\nBN/KL region. Our work increases the number of young stars with measured proper\nmotion at radio frequencies by a factor of 2.5 and enables us to perform a\nbetter statistical analysis of the kinematics of the region than was previously\npossible. Most stars (79 out of 88) have proper motions consistent with a\nGaussian distribution centered on\n$\\overline{\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos{\\delta}}=1.07\\pm0.09\\quad{\\rm mas\\,yr^{-1}}$, and\n$\\overline{\\mu_{\\delta}}=-0.84\\pm0.16\\quad{\\rm mas\\,yr^{-1}}$, with velocity\ndispersions of $\\sigma_{\\alpha}=1.08\\pm0.07\\quad{\\rm mas\\,\\,yr^{-1}},$\n$\\sigma_{\\delta}=1.27\\pm0.15\\quad{\\rm mas\\,\\,yr^{-1}}$. We looked for organized\nmovements of these stars but found no clear indication of radial\nexpansion/contraction or rotation. The remaining nine stars in our sample show\npeculiar proper motions that differ from the mean proper motions of the ONC by\nmore than 3-$\\sigma$. One of these stars, V 1326 Ori, could have been expelled\nfrom the Orion Trapezium 7,000 years ago. Two could be related to the\nmulti-stellar disintegration in the BN/KL region, in addition to the previously\nknown sources BN, I and n. The others either have high uncertainties (so their\nanomalous proper motions are not firmly established) or could be foreground\nobjects.\n", "  Quantitative models of sunspot and starspot decay predict the timescale of\nmagnetic diffusion and may yield important constraints in stellar dynamo\nmodels. Motivated by recent measurements of starspot lifetimes, we investigate\nthe disintegration of a magnetic flux tube by nonlinear diffusion. Previous\ntheoretical studies are extended by considering two physically motivated\nfunctional forms for the nonlinear diffusion coefficient $D$: an inverse\npower-law dependence $D \\propto B^{-\\nu}$ and a step-function dependence of $D$\non the magnetic field magnitude $B$. Analytical self-similar solutions are\npresented for the power-law case, including solutions exhibiting \"superfast\"\ndiffusion. For the step-function case, the heat-balance integral method yields\napproximate solutions, valid for moderately suppressed diffusion in the spot.\nThe accuracy of the resulting solutions is confirmed numerically, using a\nmethod which provides an accurate description of long-time evolution by\nimposing boundary conditions at infinite distance from the spot. The new models\nmay allow insight into differences and similarities between sunspots and\nstarspots.\n", "  We have obtained three epochs of Chandra ACIS-I observations (totaling\n$\\sim$184 ks) of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC~300 to study the logN-logS\ndistributions of its X-ray point source population down to\n$\\sim$2$\\times$10$^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 0.35-8 keV band\n(equivalent to $\\sim$10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The individual epoch logN-logS\ndistributions are best described as the sum of a background AGN component, a\nsimple power law, and a broken power law, with the shape of the logN-logS\ndistributions sometimes varying between observations. The simple power law and\nAGN components produce a good fit for \"persistent\" sources (i.e., with fluxes\nthat remain constant within a factor of $\\sim$2). The differential power law\nindex of $\\sim$1.2 and high fluxes suggest that the persistent sources\nintrinsic to NGC~300 are dominated by Roche lobe overflowing low mass X-ray\nbinaries. The variable X-ray sources are described by a broken power law, with\na faint-end power law index of $\\sim$1.7, a bright-end index of $\\sim$2.8-4.9,\nand a break flux of $\\sim$8$\\times10^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$\n($\\sim$4$\\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), suggesting they are mostly outbursting,\nwind-fed high mass X-ray binaries, although the logN-logS distribution of\nvariable sources likely also contains low-mass X-ray binaries. We generate\nmodel logN-logS distributions for synthetic X-ray binaries and constrain the\ndistribution of maximum X-ray fluxes attained during outburst. Our observations\nsuggest that the majority of outbursting X-ray binaries occur at sub-Eddington\nluminosities, where mass transfer likely occurs through direct wind accretion\nat $\\sim$1-3% of the Eddington rate.\n", "  The flavor composition of astrophysical neutrinos observed in neutrino\ntelescopes is a powerful discriminator between different astrophysical neutrino\nproduction mechanisms and can also teach us about the particle physics\nproperties of neutrinos. In this paper, we investigate how the possible\nexistence of light sterile neutrinos can affect these flavor ratios. We\nconsider two scenarios: (i) neutrino production in conventional astrophysical\nsources, followed by partial oscillation into sterile states; (ii) neutrinos\nfrom dark matter decay with a primary flavor composition enhanced in tau\nneutrinos or sterile neutrinos. Throughout the paper, we constrain the sterile\nneutrino mixing parameters from a full global fit to short and long baseline\ndata. We present our results in the form of flavor triangles and, for scenario\n(ii), as exclusion limits on the dark matter mass and lifetime, derived from a\nfit to IceCube high energy starting events and through-going muons. We argue\nthat identifying a possible flux of neutrinos from dark matter decay may\nrequire analyzing the flavor composition as a function of neutrino energy.\n", "  We present the discovery of stellar tidal tails around the Large and the\nSmall Magellanic Clouds in the Gaia DR1 data. In between the Clouds, their\ntidal arms are stretched towards each other to form an almost continuous\nstellar bridge. Our analysis relies on the exquisite quality of the Gaia's\nphotometric catalogue to build detailed star-count maps of the Clouds. We\ndemonstrate that the Gaia DR1 data can be used to detect variable stars across\nthe whole sky, and in particular, RR Lyrae stars in and around the LMC and the\nSMC. Additionally, we use a combination of Gaia and Gale to follow the\ndistribution of Young Main Sequence stars in the Magellanic System. Viewed by\nGaia, the Clouds show unmistakable signs of interaction. Around the LMC, clumps\nof RR Lyrae are observable as far as ~20 degrees, in agreement with the most\nrecent map of Mira-like stars reported in Deason et al (2016). The SMC's outer\nstellar density contours show a characteristic S-shape, symptomatic of the\non-set of tidal stripping. Beyond several degrees from the center of the dwarf,\nthe Gaia RR Lyrae stars trace the Cloud's trailing arm, extending towards the\nLMC. This stellar tidal tail mapped with RR Lyrae is not aligned with the\ngaseous Magellanic Bridge, and is shifted by some ~5 degrees from the Young\nMain Sequence bridge. We use the offset between the bridges to put constraints\non the density of the hot gaseous corona of the Milky Way.\n", "  The recent discovery of double main sequences in the young, massive star\ncluster NGC 1856 has caught significant attention. The observations can be\nexplained by invoking two stellar generations with different ages and\nmetallicities or by a single generation of stars composed of two populations\ncharacterized by different rotation rates. We analyzed the number ratios of\nstars belonging to both main-sequence components in NGC 1856 as a function of\nradius. We found that their number ratios remain approximately unchanged from\nthe cluster's central region to its periphery, indicating that both components\nare homogeneously distributed in space. Through a comparison of the loci of the\nbest-fitting isochrones with the ridge lines of both stellar components, we\nfound that both multiple stellar populations and rapid stellar rotation can\npotentially explain the observed main-sequence bifurcation in NGC 1856.\nHowever, if NGC1856 were a young representative of the old globular clusters,\nthen the multiple stellar populations model would not be able to explain the\nobserved homogeneity in the spatial distributions of these two components,\nsince all relevant scenarios would predict that the second stellar generation\nshould be formed in a more compact configuration than that of the first stellar\ngeneration, while NGC 1856 is too young for both stellar generations to have\nbeen fully mixed dynamically. We speculate that the rapid stellar rotation\nscenario would be the favored explanation of the observed multiple stellar\nsequences in NGC 1856.\n", "  We study the long-term ($\\approx$30 years) radio variability of 43 radio\nbright AGNs by exploiting the data base of the University of Michigan Radio\nAstronomy Observatory (UMRAO) monitoring program. We model the periodograms\n(temporal power spectra) of the observed lightcurves as simple power-law noise\n(red noise, spectral power $P(f)\\propto f^{-\\beta}$) using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, taking into account windowing effects (red-noise leak, aliasing).\nThe power spectra of 39 (out of 43) sources are in good agreement with the\nmodels, yielding a range in power spectral index ($\\beta$) from $\\approx$1 to\n$\\approx$3. We fit a Gaussian function to each flare in a given lightcurve to\nobtain the flare duration. We discover a correlation between $\\beta$ and the\nmedian duration of the flares. We use the derivative of a lightcurve to obtain\na characteristic variability timescale which does not depend on the assumed\nfunctional form of the flares, incomplete fitting, and so on. We find that,\nonce the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting are corrected for, the\nvariability timescales of our sources are proportional to the accretion rate to\nthe power of $0.25\\pm 0.03$ over five orders of magnitude in accretion rate,\nregardless of source type. We further find that modeling the periodograms of\nfour of our sources requires the assumption of broken powerlaw spectra. From\nsimulating lightcurves as superpositions of exponential flares we conclude that\nstrong overlap of flares leads to featureless simple power-law periodograms of\nAGNs at radio wavelengths in most cases.\n", "  In this paper we use a recently compiled data set, which comprises 118\ngalactic-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems to constrain the\nstatistic property of SGL system, as well as the curvature of universe without\nassuming any fiducial cosmological model. Based on the singular isothermal\nellipsoid (SIE) model of SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature\nparameter $\\Omega_{\\rm k}$ is close to zero from the SGL data, which is\nconsistent with the latest result of planck measurement. More interestingly, we\nfind that the parameter $f$ in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the\ncurvature $\\Omega_{\\rm k}$. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will\nsignificantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature.\nFurthermore, the obtained constraint on $f$ is different from previous results:\n$f=1.105\\pm0.030$ ($68\\%$ C.L.), which means that the standard singular\nisothermal sphere (SIS) model ($f=1$) is disfavored by the current SGL data at\nmore than $3\\sigma$ confidence level. We also divide the whole SGL data into\ntwo parts according to the centric stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm c}$\nand find that the larger value of $\\sigma_{\\rm c}$ the subsample has, the more\nfavored the standard SIS model is. Finally, we extend the SIE model by assuming\nthe power-law density profiles for the total mass density,\n$\\rho=\\rho_0(r/r_0)^{-\\alpha}$, and luminosity density,\n$\\nu=\\nu_0(r/r_0)^{-\\delta}$, and obtain the constraints on the power-law\nindexes: $\\alpha=1.95\\pm0.04$ and $\\delta=2.40\\pm0.13$ at 68\\% confidence\nlevel. When assuming the power-law index $\\alpha=\\delta=\\gamma$, this scenario\nis totally disfavored by the current SGL data, $\\chi^2_{\\rm min,\\gamma} -\n\\chi^2_{\\rm min,SIE} \\simeq 53$.\n", "  We compute the twist-three fragmentation contribution to the transverse\nsingle spin asymmetry (SSA) in light hadron production $p^\\uparrow p\\to hX$ and\n$p^\\uparrow A\\to hX$ including the gluon saturation effect in the unpolarized\nnucleon/nucleus. Together with the results in our previous paper, this\ncompletes the full evaluation of the SSA in this process in the \"hybrid\"\nformalism. We argue that the dependence of SSAs on the atomic mass number in\nthe forward region can elucidate the relative importance of the soft gluon pole\ncontribution from the twist-three quark-gluon-quark correlation in the\npolarized nucleon and the twist-three fragmentation contribution from the final\nstate hadron.\n", "  If the standard model of quarks and leptons is extended to include three\nsinglet right-handed neutrinos, then the resulting fermion structure admits an\ninfinite number of anomaly-free solutions with just one simple constraint.\nWell-known examples satisfying this constraint are $B-L$, $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ ,\n$B-3L_{\\tau}$ , etc. We derive this simple constraint, and discuss two new\nexamples which offer some insights to the structure of mixing among quark and\nlepton families, together with their possible verification at the Large Hadron\nCollider.\n", "  We present a sample of 224 stars that emit H$\\alpha$ (H$\\alpha$ stars) in the\nAndromeda galaxy (M31). The stars were selected from $\\sim$ 5000 spectra,\ncollected as part of the Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's\nStellar Halo survey using Keck II/DEIMOS. We used six-filter Hubble Space\nTelescope photometry from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey to\nclassify and investigate the properties of the H$\\alpha$ stars. We identified\nfive distinct categories of H$\\alpha$ star: B-type main sequence (MS) stars,\n`transitioning'-MS (T-MS) stars, red core He burning (RHeB) stars, non-C-rich\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and C-rich AGB stars. We found $\\sim$ 12\nper cent of B-type stars exhibit H$\\alpha$ emission (Be stars). The frequency\nof Be to all B stars is known to vary with the metallicity of their\nenvironment. Comparing this proportion of Be stars with other environments\naround the Local Group, the result could indicate that M31 is more metal rich\nthan the Milky Way. We predict that the 17 T-MS H$\\alpha$ stars are Be stars\nevolving off the MS with fading H$\\alpha$ emission. We separated RHeB from AGB\nH$\\alpha$ stars. We conclude that the 61 RHeB and AGB stars are likely to be\nLong Period Variables. We found that $\\sim$ 14 per cent of C-rich AGB stars (C\nstars) emit H$\\alpha$, which is an upper limit for the ratio of C-rich Miras to\nC stars. This catalogue of H$\\alpha$ stars will be useful to constrain stellar\nevolutionary models, calibrate distance indicators for intermediate age\npopulations, and investigate the properties of M31.\n", "  Current particle transport models describe the propagation of charged\nparticles across the mean field direction in turbulent plasmas as diffusion.\nHowever, recent studies suggest that at short time-scales, such as soon after\nsolar energetic particle (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently\nmeandering field lines, which results in non-diffusive initial propagation\nacross the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to\ninvestigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines,\nand quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle\npropagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean\nmagnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the\nfield lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their\ninitial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for\n0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1~AU.\nSubsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after\nhundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive\nbehaviour consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by\nthe meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the\npre-diffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1~AU solar\nwind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1~AU and must\nbe taken into account when modelling SEP propagation in the interplanetary\nspace.\n", "  We have examined the resolved stellar populations at large galactocentric\ndistances along the minor axis (from 10 kpc up to between 40 and 75 kpc), with\nlimited major axis coverage, of six nearby highly-inclined Milky Way-mass disc\ngalaxies using HST data from the GHOSTS survey. We select red giant branch\nstars to derive stellar halo density profiles. The projected minor axis density\nprofiles can be approximated by power laws with projected slopes of between\n$-2$ and $-3.7$ and a diversity of stellar halo masses of $1-6\\times\n10^{9}M_{\\odot}$, or $2-14\\%$ of the total galaxy stellar masses. The typical\nintrinsic scatter around a smooth power law fit is $0.05-0.1$ dex owing to\nsubstructure. By comparing the minor and major axis profiles, we infer\nprojected axis ratios $c/a$ at $\\sim 25$ kpc between $0.4-0.75$. The GHOSTS\nstellar haloes are diverse, lying between the extremes charted out by the\n(rather atypical) haloes of the Milky Way and M31. We find a strong correlation\nbetween the stellar halo metallicities and the stellar halo masses. We compare\nour results with cosmological models, finding good agreement between our\nobservations and accretion-only models where the stellar haloes are formed by\nthe disruption of dwarf satellites. In particular, the strong observed\ncorrelation between stellar halo metallicity and mass is naturally reproduced.\nLow-resolution hydrodynamical models have unrealistically high stellar halo\nmasses. Current high-resolution hydrodynamical models appear to predict stellar\nhalo masses somewhat higher than observed but with reasonable metallicities,\nmetallicity gradients and density profiles.\n", "  Lya nebulae, or \"Lya blobs\", are extended (up to ~100 kpc), bright (L[Lya] >\n10^43 erg/s) clouds of Lya emitting gas that tend to lie in overdense regions\nat z ~ 2--5. The origin of the Lya emission remains unknown, but recent\ntheoretical work suggests that measuring the polarization might discriminate\namong powering mechanisms. Here we present the first narrowband, imaging\npolarimetry of a radio-loud Lya nebula, B3 J2330+3927 at z=3.09, with an\nembedded active galactic nucleus (AGN). The AGN lies near the blob's Lya\nemission peak and its radio lobes align roughly with the blob's major axis.\nWith the SPOL polarimeter on the 6.5m MMT telescope, we map the total (Lya +\ncontinuum) polarization in a grid of circular apertures of radius 0.6\"\n(4.4kpc), detecting a significant (>2sigma) polarization fraction P in nine\napertures and achieving strong upper-limits (as low as 2%) elsewhere. P\nincreases from <2% at ~5kpc from the blob center to ~17% at ~15-25kpc. The\ndetections are distributed asymmetrically, roughly along the nebula's major\naxis. The polarization angles theta are mostly perpendicular to this axis.\nComparing the Lya flux to that of the continuum, and conservatively assuming\nthat the continuum is highly polarized (20-100%) and aligned with the total\npolarization, we place lower limits on the polarization of the Lya emission\nP(Lya) ranging from no significant polarization at ~5 kpc from the blob center\nto ~ 3--17% at 10--25kpc. Like the total polarization, the Lya polarization\ndetections occur more often along the blob's major axis.\n", "  Chondritic meteorites contain unique spherical materials named chondrules:\nsub-mm sized silicate grains once melted in a high temperature condition in the\nsolar nebula. We numerically explore one of chondrule forming processes,\nplanetesimal collisions. Previous studies found that impact jetting via\nprotoplanet-planetesimal collisions make chondrules with an amount of 1 % of\nimpactors' mass, when impact velocity exceeds 2.5 km s$^{-1}$. Based on the\nmineralogical data of chondrules, undifferentiated planetesimals would be more\nsuitable for chondrule-forming collisions than potentially differentiated\nprotoplanets. We examine planetesimal-planetesimal collisions using a shock\nphysics code and find two things: one is that planetesimal-planetesimal\ncollisions produce the nearly same amount of chondrules as\nprotoplanet-planetesimal collisions ($\\sim$ 1 %). The other is that the amount\nof produced chondrules becomes larger as the impact velocity increases when two\nplanetesimals collide with each other. We also find that progenitors of\nchondrules can be ejected from deeper regions of large targets (planetesimals\nor protoplanets) than small impactors (planetesimals). The composition of\ntargets is therefore important to fully account for the mineralogical data of\ncurrently sampled chondrules.\n", "  We present new software to cross-match low-frequency radio catalogues: the\nPositional Update and Matching Algorithm (PUMA). PUMA combines a positional\nBayesian probabilistic approach with spectral matching criteria, allowing for\nconfusing sources in the matching process. We go on to create a radio sky model\nusing PUMA based on the Murchison Widefield Array Commissioning Survey, and are\nable to automatically cross-match 98.5% of sources. Using the characteristics\nof this sky model, we create simple simulated mock catalogues on which to test\nPUMA, and find that PUMA can reliably find the correct spectral indices of\nsources, along with being able to recover ionospheric offsets. Finally, we use\nthis sky model to calibrate and remove foreground sources from simulated\ninterferometric data, generated using OSKAR (the Oxford University visibility\ngenerator). We demonstrate that there is a substantial improvement in\nforeground source removal when using higher frequency and higher resolution\nsource positions, even when correcting positions by an average of 0.3 given a\nsynthesized beam-width of 2.3.\n", "  Fractal dimensions can be used to characterize the clustering and\nlacunarities in density distributions. We use generalized fractal dimensions to\nstudy the neutral hydrogen distribution (HI) during the epoch of reionization.\nUsing a semi-numeric model of ionized bubbles to generate the HI field, we\ncalculate the fractal dimensions for length scales $\\sim 10 h^{-1}$ cMpc. We\nfind that the HI field displays significant multifractal behaviour and is not\nconsistent with homogeneity at these scales when the mass averaged neutral\nfraction $\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI}^M \\gtrsim 0.5$. This multifractal nature is driven\nentirely by the shapes and distribution of the ionized regions. The sensitivity\nof the fractal dimension to the neutral fraction implies that it can be used\nfor constraining reionization history. We find that the fractal dimension is\nrelatively less sensitive to the value of the minimum mass of ionizing haloes\nwhen it is in the range $\\sim 10^9 - 10^{10} h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$. Interestingly,\nthe fractal dimension is very different when the reionization proceeds\ninside-out compared to when it is outside-in. Thus the multifractal nature of\nHI density field at high redshifts can be used to study the nature of\nreionization.\n", "  We compare the isophote shape parameter $a_{4}$ of early-type galaxies (ETGs)\nbetween $z\\sim1$ and 0 as a proxy for dynamics to investigate the epoch at\nwhich the dynamical properties of ETGs are established, using cluster ETG\nsamples with stellar masses of $\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})\\geq10.5$ which have\nspectroscopic redshifts. We have 130 ETGs from the Hubble Space Telescope\nCluster Supernova Survey for $z\\sim1$ and 355 ETGs from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey for $z\\sim0$. We have developed an isophote shape analysis method which\ncan be used for high-redshift galaxies and has been carefully compared with\npublished results. We have applied the same method for both the $z\\sim1$ and\n$0$ samples. We find similar dependence of the $a_{4}$ parameter on the mass\nand size at $z\\sim1$ and 0; the main population of ETGs changes from disky to\nboxy at a critical stellar mass of $\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})\\sim11.5$ with the\nmassive end dominated by boxy. The disky ETG fraction decreases with increasing\nstellar mass both at $z\\sim1$ and $0$, and is consistent between these\nredshifts in all stellar mass bins when the Eddington bias is taken into\naccount. Although uncertainties are large, the results suggest that the\nisophote shapes and probably dynamical properties of ETGs in massive clusters\nare already in place at $z>1$ and do not significantly evolve in $z<1$, despite\nsignificant size evolution in the same galaxy population. The constant disky\nfraction favors less violent processes than mergers as a main cause of the size\nand morphological evolution of intermediate mass ETGs in $z<1$.\n", "  We present an analysis of Mg II $\\lambda2798$ and Fe II UV emission lines for\narchival Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars to explore diagnostics of the\nmagnesium-to-iron abundance ratio in a broad-line region cloud. Our sample\nconsists of 17,432 quasars selected from the SDSS Data Release 7 with a\nredshift range of $0.72 < z < 1.63$. A strong anticorrelation between Mg II\nequivalent width (EW) and the Eddington ratio is found, while only a weak\npositive correlation is found between Fe II EW and the Eddington ratio. To\ninvestigate the origin of these differing behaviors of Mg II and Fe II emission\nlines, we have performed photoionization calculations using the Cloudy code,\nwhere constraints from recent reverberation mapping studies are considered. We\nfind from calculations that (i) Mg II and Fe II emission lines are created at\ndifferent regions in a photoionized cloud, and (ii) their EW correlations with\nthe Eddington ratio can be explained by just changing the cloud gas density.\nThese results indicate that the Mg II/Fe II flux ratio, which has been used as\na first-order proxy for the Mg/Fe abundance ratio in chemical evolution studies\nwith quasar emission lines, depends largely on the cloud gas density. By\ncorrecting this density dependence, we propose new diagnostics of the Mg/Fe\nabundance ratio for a broad line region cloud. Comparing the derived Mg/Fe\nabundance ratios with chemical evolution models, we suggest that\n$\\alpha$-enrichment by mass loss from metal-poor intermediate-mass stars\noccurred at $z\\sim2$ or earlier.\n", "  The Kepler era of exoplanetary discovery has presented the Astronomical\ncommunity with a cornucopia of planetary systems very different from the one\nwhich we inhabit. It has long been known that Jupiter plays a major role in the\norbital parameters of Mars and it's climate, but there is also a long-standing\nbelief that Jupiter would play a similar role for Earth if not for its large\nmoon. Using a three dimensional general circulation model (3-D GCM) with a\nfully-coupled ocean we simulate what would happen to the climate of an\nEarth-like world if Mars did not exist, but a Jupiter-like planet was much\ncloser to Earth's orbit. We investigate two scenarios that involve evolution of\nthe Earth-like planet's orbital eccentricity from 0--0.283 over 6500 years, and\nfrom 0--0.066 on a time scale of 4500 years. In both cases we discover that\nthey would maintain relatively temperate climates over the time-scales\nsimulated. More Earth-like planets in multi-planet systems will be discovered\nas we continue to survey the skies and the results herein show that the\nproximity of large gas giant planets may play an important role in the\nhabitability of these worlds. These are the first such 3-D GCM simulations\nusing a fully-coupled ocean with a planetary orbit that evolves over time due\nto the presence of a giant planet.\n", "  X-ray observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) allow us to investigate the\nchemical inhomogeneity of ejecta, offering unique insight into the\nnucleosynthesis in supernova explosions. Here we present detailed imaging and\nspectroscopic studies of the \"Fe knot\" located along the eastern rim of the\nType Ia SNR Tycho (SN 1572) using Suzaku and Chandra long-exposure data.\nSurprisingly, the Suzaku spectrum of this knot shows no emission from Cr, Mn,\nor Ni, which is unusual for the Fe-rich regions in this SNR. Within the\nframework of the canonical delayed-detonation models for SN Ia, the observed\nmass ratios M_Cr/M_Fe < 0.023, M_Mn/M_Fe < 0.012, and M_Ni/M_Fe < 0.029 (at 90%\nconfidence) can only be achieved for a peak temperature of (5.3-5.7) x 10^9 K\nand a neutron excess of < 2.0 x 10^-3. These constraints rule out the deep,\ndense core of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf as the origin of the Fe knot,\nand favors either incomplete Si burning or the alpha-rich freeze-out regime,\nprobably close to their boundary. An explosive He burning regime is a possible\nalternative, although this hypothesis is in conflict with the main properties\nof this SNR.\n", "  We present a new velocity-resolved survey of 2.9 $\\mu$m spectra of hot H$_2$O\nand OH gas emission from protoplanetary disks, obtained with CRIRES at the VLT\n($\\Delta v \\sim$ 3 km s$^{-1}$). With the addition of archival Spitzer-IRS\nspectra, this is the most comprehensive spectral dataset of water vapor\nemission from disks ever assembled. We provide line fluxes at 2.9-33 $\\mu$m\nthat probe from disk radii of $\\sim0.05$ au out to the region across the water\nsnow line. With a combined dataset for 55 disks, we find a new correlation\nbetween H$_2$O line fluxes and the radius of CO gas emission as measured in\nvelocity-resolved 4.7 $\\mu$m spectra (R$_{\\rm co}$), which probes molecular\ngaps in inner disks. We find that H$_2$O emission disappears from 2.9 $\\mu$m\n(hotter water) to 33 $\\mu$m (colder water) as R$_{\\rm co}$ increases and\nexpands out to the snow line radius. These results suggest that the infrared\nwater spectrum is a tracer of inside-out water depletion within the snow line.\nIt also helps clarifying an unsolved discrepancy between water observations and\nmodels, by finding that disks around stars of M$_{\\star}>1.5$ M$_\\odot$\ngenerally have inner gaps with depleted molecular gas content. We measure\nradial trends in H$_2$O, OH, and CO line fluxes that can be used as benchmarks\nfor models to study the chemical composition and evolution of planet-forming\ndisk regions at 0.05-20 au. We propose that JWST spectroscopy of molecular gas\nmay be used as a probe of inner disk gas depletion, complementary to the larger\ngaps and holes detected by direct imaging and by ALMA.\n", "  Galaxy interactions are thought to be one of the main triggers of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN), especially at high luminosities, where the accreted gas\nmass during the AGN lifetime is substantial. Evidence for a connection between\nmergers and AGN, however, remains mixed. Possible triggering mechanisms remain\nparticularly poorly understood for luminous AGN, which are thought to require\ntriggering by major mergers, rather than secular processes. We analyse the host\ngalaxies of a sample of 20 optically and X-ray selected luminous AGN\n(log($L_{bol}$ [erg/s]) $>$ 45) at z $\\sim$ 0.6 using HST WFC3 data in the\nF160W/H band. 15/20 sources have resolved host galaxies. We create a control\nsample of mock AGN by matching the AGN host galaxies to a control sample of\nnon-AGN galaxies. Visual signs of disturbances are found in about 25% of\nsources in both the AGN hosts and control galaxies. Using both visual\nclassification and quantitative morphology measures, we show that the levels of\ndisturbance are not enhanced when compared to a matched control sample. We find\nno signs that major mergers play a dominant role in triggering AGN at high\nluminosities, suggesting that minor mergers and secular processes dominate AGN\ntriggering up to the highest AGN luminosities. The upper limit on the enhanced\nfraction of major mergers is $\\leqslant$20%. While major mergers might increase\nthe incidence of (luminous AGN), they are not the prevalent triggering\nmechanism in the population of unobscured AGN.\n", "  Supernova (SN) 2008bk is a well observed low-luminosity Type II event\nvisually associated with a low-mass red-supergiant progenitor. To model SN\n2008bk, we evolve a 12Msun star from the main sequence until core collapse,\nwhen it has a total mass of 9.88Msun, a He-core mass of 3.22Msun, and a radius\nof 502Rsun. We then artificially trigger an explosion that produces 8.29Msun of\nejecta with a total energy of 2.5x10^50erg and ~0.009Msun of 56Ni. We model the\nsubsequent evolution of the ejecta with non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium\ntime-dependent radiative transfer. Although somewhat too luminous and\nenergetic, this model reproduces satisfactorily the multi-band light curves and\nmulti-epoch spectra of SN 2008bk, confirming the suitability of a low-mass\nmassive star progenitor. As in other low-luminosity SNe II, the structured\nHalpha profile at the end of the plateau phase is probably caused by BaII\n6496.9A rather than asphericity. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to\nchanges in progenitor radius and mass, as well as chemical mixing. A 15%\nincrease in progenitor radius causes a 15% increase in luminosity and a 0.2mag\nV-band brightening of the plateau but leaves its length unaffected. An increase\nin ejecta mass by 10% lengthens the plateau by ~10d. Chemical mixing introduces\nslight changes to the bolometric light curve, limited to the end of the\nplateau, but has a large impact on colours and spectra at nebular times.\n", "  We investigate star formation in DLSCL J0916.2+2953, a dissociative merger of\ntwo clusters at z=0.53 that has progressed $1.1^{+1.3}_{-0.4}$ Gyr since first\npass-through. We attempt to reveal the effects a collision may have had on the\nevolution of the cluster galaxies by tracing their star formation history. We\nprobe current and recent activity to identify a possible star formation event\nat the time of the merger using EW(Hd), EW([OII]), and D$_{n}$4000 measured\nfrom the composite spectra of 64 cluster and 153 coeval field galaxies. We\nsupplement $Keck$ DEIMOS spectra with DLS and $HST$ imaging to determine the\ncolor, stellar mass, and morphology of each galaxy and conduct a comprehensive\nstudy of the populations in this complex structure. Spectral results indicate\nthe average cluster and cluster red sequence galaxies experienced no enhanced\nstar formation relative to the surrounding field during the merger, ruling out\na predominantly merger-quenched population. We find that the average blue\ngalaxy in the North cluster is currently active and in the South cluster is\ncurrently post-starburst having undergone a recent star formation event. While\nthe North activity could be latent or long-term merger effects, a young blue\nstellar population and irregular geometry suggest the cluster was still forming\nprior the collision. While the South activity coincides with the time of the\nmerger, the blue early-type population could be a result of secular cluster\nprocesses. The evidence suggests that the dearth or surfeit of activity is\nindiscernible from normal cluster galaxy evolution.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the analysis of the peculiar X-ray variability\ndisplayed by the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 in a 80\nks-long joint NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observation performed during the source\noutburst in 2015. The light curve of the source was characterized by a\nflaring-like behavior, with typical rise and decay time scales of ~120 s. The\nflares are accompanied by a remarkable spectral variability, with the X-ray\nemission being generally softer at the peak of the flares. A strong quasi\nperiodic oscillation (QPO) is detected at ~8 mHz in the power spectrum of the\nsource and clearly associated with the flaring-like behavior. This feature has\nthe strongest power at soft X-rays (<3 keV). We carried out a dedicated\nhardness-ratio resolved spectral analysis and a QPO phase-resolved spectral\nanalysis, together with an in-depth study of the source timing properties, to\ninvestigate the origin of this behavior. We suggest that the unusual\nvariability of IGR J00291+5934 observed by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR could be\nproduced by an heartbeat-like mechanism, similar to that operating in\nblack-hole X-ray binaries. The possibility that this variability, and the\nassociated QPO, are triggered by phases of quasi-stable nuclear burning, as\nsuggested in the literature for a number of other neutron star binaries\ndisplaying a similar behavior, cannot be solidly tested in the case of IGR\nJ00291+5934 due to the paucity of type-I X-ray bursts observed from this\nsource.\n", "  The variation of a stellar light curve owing to the rotational modulation by\nthe magnetic features (starspots and faculae) on the star's surface can be used\nto investigate the magnetic properties of the host star. In this paper, we use\nthe periodicity and magnitude of the light-curve variation, as two proxies,\nsuggested by (He et al. 2015), to study the stellar magnetic properties for a\nlarge sample of G-type main sequence \\emph{Kepler} targets, for which the\nrotation periods recently determined by (McQuillan et al. 2014). By analyzing\nthe correlation between the two magnetic proxies, it is found that: (1) The two\nproxies are positively correlated for most of the stars in our sample, and the\npercentages of negative, zero, and positive correlation are $4.27\\%$, $6.81\\%$,\nand $88.91\\%$, respectively; (2) Negative correlation stars cannot have large\nmagnitude of light-curve variation; (3) with the increase of rotation period,\nthe relative number of positive correlation stars decreases and the negative\ncorrelation one increases. These results indicate that the stars with shorter\nrotation period tend to have positive correlation between the two proxies, and\na good portion of the positive correlation stars have larger magnitude of\nlight-curve variation (and hence more intense magnetic activities) than the\nnegative correlation stars.\n", "  The extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies analyzed in a previous paper have\nlarge star-forming regions with a metallicity lower than the rest of the\ngalaxy. Such a chemical inhomogeneity reveals the external origin of the\nmetal-poor gas fueling star formation, possibly indicating accretion from the\ncosmic web. This paper studies the kinematic properties of the ionized gas in\nthese galaxies. Most XMPs have rotation velocity around a few tens of km/s. The\nstar-forming regions appear to move coherently. The velocity is constant within\neach region, and the velocity dispersion sometimes increases within the\nstar-forming clump towards the galaxy midpoint, suggesting inspiral motion\ntoward the galaxy center. Other regions present a local maximum in velocity\ndispersion at their center, suggesting a moderate global expansion. The Halpha\nline wings show a number of faint emission features with amplitudes around a\nfew percent of the main Halpha component, and wavelength shifts between 100 and\n400 km/s. The components are often paired, so that red and blue emission\nfeatures with similar amplitudes and shifts appear simultaneously. Assuming the\nfaint emission to be produced by expanding shell-like structures, the inferred\nmass loading factor (mass loss rate divided by star formation rate) exceeds 10.\nSince the expansion velocity exceeds by far the rotational and turbulent\nvelocities, the gas may eventually escape from the galaxy disk. The observed\nmotions involve energies consistent with the kinetic energy released by\nindividual core-collapse supernovae. Alternative explanations for the faint\nemission have been considered and discarded.\n", "  By comparing the properties of non-recycled radio-loud $\\gamma-$ray pulsars\nand radio-quiet $\\gamma-$ray pulsars, we have searched for the differences\nbetween these two populations. We found that the $\\gamma-$ray spectral\ncurvature of radio-quiet pulsars can be larger than that of radio-loud pulsars.\nBased on the full sample of non-recycled $\\gamma-$ray pulsars, their\ndistributions of the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder are also\nfound to be different. We notice that this might be resulted from the\nobservational bias. In re-examining the previously reported difference of\n$\\gamma-$ray-to-X-ray flux ratios, we found the significance can be hampered by\ntheir statistical uncertainties. In the context of outer gap model, we discuss\nthe expected properties of these two populations and compare with the possible\ndifferences identified in our analysis.\n", "  Single crystals of (Eu$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$)O have been grown in a molten\nbarium-magnesium metal flux at temperatures up to 1000{\\deg}C, producing single\ncrystals of (Eu$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$)O with barium doping levels ranging from $x=0.03$\nto $x=0.25$. Magnetic measurements show that the ferromagnetic Curie\ntemperature T$_C$ correlates with the Ba doping levels, and a modified\nHeisenberg model was used to describe the stoichiometry dependence of T$_C$.\nExtrapolation of the results indicates that a sample with Ba concentration of\n$x=0.72$ should have a T$_C$ of 0 K, potentially producing a quantum phase\ntransition in this material.\n", "  Multi-wavelength observations of mature supernova remnants (SNRs), especially\nwith recent advances in gamma-ray astronomy, make it possible to constrain\nenergy distribution of energetic particles within these remnants. In\nconsideration of the SNR origin of Galactic cosmic rays and physics related to\nparticle acceleration and radiative processes, we use a simple one-zone model\nto fit the nonthermal emission spectra of three shell-type SNRs located within\n2 degrees on the sky: RX J1713.7-3946, CTB 37B, and CTB 37A. Although radio\nimages of these three sources all show a shell (or half-shell) structure, their\nradio, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra are quite different, offering an ideal case\nto explore evolution of energetic particle distribution in SNRs. Our spectral\nfitting shows that 1) the particle distribution becomes harder with aging of\nthese SNRs, implying a continuous acceleration process, and the particle\ndistributions of CTB 37A and CTB 37B in the GeV range are harder than the\nhardest distribution that can be produced at a shock via the linear diffusive\nshock particle acceleration process, so spatial transport may play a role; 2)\nthe energy loss timescale of electrons at the high-energy cutoff due to\nsynchrotron radiation appears to be always a bit (within a factor of a few)\nshorter than the age of the corresponding remnant, which also requires\ncontinuous particle acceleration; 3) double power-law distributions are needed\nto fit the spectra of CTB 37B and CTB 37A, which may be attributed to shock\ninteraction with molecular clouds.\n", "  The circumgalactic medium (CGM) traced by OVI $\\lambda\\lambda 1031, 1037$\ndoublet absorption has been found to concentrate along the projected major and\nminor axes of the host galaxies. This suggests that OVI traces accreting and\noutflowing gas, respectively, which are key components of the baryon cycle of\ngalaxies. We investigate this further by examining the kinematics of 29 OVI\nabsorbers associated with galaxies at $0.13 < z_{\\rm gal} < 0.66$ as a function\nof galaxy color, inclination, and azimuthal angle. Each galaxy was imaged with\nHST and the absorption was detected in COS/HST spectra of nearby ($D<200$ kpc)\nbackground quasars. We use the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function to\ncharacterize the velocity spread of the absorbers, which is a method used\npreviously for a sample of MgII absorber--galaxy pairs. The absorption velocity\nspread for OVI is more extended than MgII, which suggests that the two ions\ntrace differing components of the CGM. Also contrary to MgII, the OVI\nabsorption velocity spreads are similar regardless of galaxy color,\ninclination, and azimuthal angle. This indicates that the kinematics of the\nhigh ionization gas is not strongly influenced by the present star formation\nactivity in the galaxy. The kinematic homogeneity of OVI absorption and its\ntendency to be observed mainly along the projected galaxy major and minor axes\nis likely due to varying ionization conditions and gas densities about the\ngalaxy. Gas in intermediate azimuthal angles may be ionized out of the OVI\nphase, possibly resulting in an azimuthal angle dependence on the distribution\nof gas in higher ionization states.\n", "  We report the detection of two new planets orbiting the K giants HD 86950 and\nHD 222076, based on precise radial velocities obtained with three instruments:\nAAT/UCLES, FEROS, and CHIRON. HD 86950b has a period of 1270$\\pm$57 days at\n$a=2.72\\pm$0.08 AU, and m sin $i=3.6\\pm$0.7 Mjup. HD 222076b has $P=871\\pm$19\ndays at $a=1.83\\pm$0.03 AU, and m sin $i=1.56\\pm$0.11 Mjup. These two giant\nplanets are typical of the population of planets known to orbit evolved stars.\nIn addition, we find a high-amplitude periodic velocity signal ($K\\sim$50 m/s)\nin HD 29399, and show that it is due to stellar variability rather than\nKeplerian reflex motion. We also investigate the relation between planet\noccurrence and host-star metallicity for the 164-star Pan-Pacific Planet Search\nsample of evolved stars. In spite of the small sample of PPPS detections, we\nconfirm the trend of increasing planet occurrence as a function of metallicity\nfound by other studies of planets orbiting evolved stars.\n", "  The Landau-de Gennes free energy is used to study theoretically the effective\ninteraction of a spherical \"key\" and an anisotropic \"lock\" colloidal particles.\nWe assume identical anchoring properties of the surfaces of the key and of the\nlock particles, and consider planar degenerate and perpendicular anchoring\nconditions separately. {The lock particle is modeled} as a spherical particle\nwith a spherical dimple. When such a particle is introduced into a nematic\nliquid crystal, it orients its dimple at an oblique angle $\\theta_{eq}$ with\nrespect to the far field director ${\\bf n}_{\\infty}$. This angle depends on the\ndepth of the dimple. Minimization results show that the free energy of a pair\nof key and lock particles exhibits a global minimum for the configuration when\nthe key particle is facing the dimple of the lock colloidal particle. The\npreferred orientation $\\phi_{eq}$ of the key-lock composite doublet relative to\n${\\bf n}_{\\infty}$ is robust against thermal fluctuations. The preferred\norientation $\\theta_{eq}^{(2)}$ of the dimple particle in the doublet is\ndifferent from the isolated situation. {This is related to the \"direct\"\ninteraction of defects accompanying the key particle with the edge of the\ndimple}. We propose that this nematic-amplified key-lock interaction can play\nan important role in self-organization and clustering of mixtures of colloidal\nparticles with dimple colloids present.\n", "  SN 2013ej is a well-studied core-collapse supernova (SN) that stemmed from a\ndirectly identified red supergiant (RSG) progenitor in galaxy M74. The source\nexhibits signs of substantial geometric asphericity, X-rays from persistent\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), thermal emission from warm dust,\nand a light curve that appears intermediate between supernovae of Types II-P\nand II-L. The proximity of this source motivates a close inspection of these\nphysical characteristics and their potential interconnection. We present\nmulti-epoch spectropolarimetry of SN 2013ej during the first 107 days, and deep\noptical spectroscopy and ultraviolet through infrared photometry past ~800\ndays. SN 2013ej exhibits the strongest and most persistent continuum and line\npolarization ever observed for a SN of its class during the recombination\nphase. Modeling indicates that the data are consistent with an oblate\nellipsoidal photosphere, viewed nearly edge-on, and probably augmented by\noptical scattering from circumstellar dust. We suggest that interaction with an\nequatorial distribution of CSM, perhaps the result of binary evolution, is\nresponsible for generating the photospheric asphericity. Relatedly, our\nlate-time optical imaging and spectroscopy shows that asymmetric CSM\ninteraction is ongoing, and the morphology of broad H-alpha emission from\nshock-excited ejecta provides additional evidence that the geometry of the\ninteraction region is ellipsoidal. Alternatively, a prolate ellipsoidal\ngeometry from an intrinsically bipolar explosion is also a plausible\ninterpretation of the data, but would probably require a ballistic jet of\nradioactive material capable of penetrating the hydrogen envelope early in the\nrecombination phase (abridged).\n", "  The interaction of two colliding Alfv\\'en wave packets is here described by\nmeans of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and hybrid kinetic numerical simulations.\nThe MHD evolution revisits the theoretical insights described by Moffatt,\nParker, Kraichnan, Chandrasekhar and Els\\\"asser in which the oppositely\npropagating large amplitude wave packets interact for a finite time, initiating\nturbulence. However, the extension to include compressive and kinetic effects,\nwhile maintaining the gross characteristics of the simpler classic formulation,\nalso reveals intriguing features which go beyond the pure MHD treatment.\n", "  Context: The damped random walk (DRW) stochastic process is nowadays\nfrequently used to model aperiodic light curves of AGNs. A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short. Application of DRW to modeling typical AGN\noptical light curves is questioned.\n", "  Braking index measurements offer the opportunity to explore the processes\naffecting the long-term spin evolution of pulsars and possible evolutionary\nconnections between the various pulsar populations. For young pulsars the\nlong-term trends are generally obscured by short term phenomena such as timing\nnoise and the recoveries form large glitches. Here we present a new method to\novercome the latter and report on braking index measurements for the Vela-like\npulsars PSR B1800-21 and PSR B1823-13, an updated measurement for Vela and new\nestimates for four more glitching pulsars observed at Jodrell Bank Observatory.\nThe values of braking indices describe the long-term evolution of the pulsars\nacross the P-P' diagram. Despite some measurements being affected by\nconsiderable uncertainties, there is evidence for a common trend involving low\nbraking indices (n<=2) among young glitching pulsars. Such values introduce a\nnew variant in the evolution of young pulsars and their relationship with other\npopulations in the P-P' diagram. Low braking indices also imply that these\npulsars could be a few times older than their characteristic ages. We consider\nPSR B1757-24 and conclude that the pulsar could be old enough to be related to\nthe supernova remnant G5.4-1.2. Between glitches, the short-term evolution of\nVela-like pulsars is characterised by large inter-glitch braking indices n_ig >\n10. We interpret both short and long term trends as signatures of the large\nglitch activity, and speculate that they are driven by short-term post-glitch\nre-coupling and a cumulative long-term decoupling of superfluid to the rotation\nof the star.\n", "  We have combined observations of Galactic high-velocity HI from two surveys:\na very sensitive survey from the Green Bank 140ft Telescope with limited sky\ncoverage, and the less sensitive but complete Galactic All Sky Survey from the\n64m Parkes Radio Telescope. The two surveys preferentially detect different\nforms of neutral gas due to their sensitivity. We adopt a machine learning\napproach to divide our data into two populations that separate across a range\nin column density: 1) a narrow line-width population typical of the majority of\nbright high velocity cloud components, and 2) a fainter, broad line-width\npopulation that aligns well with that of the population found in the Green Bank\nsurvey. We refer to these populations as dense and diffuse gas respectively,\nand find that diffuse gas is typically located at the edges and in the tails of\nhigh velocity clouds, surrounding dense components in the core. A fit to the\naverage spectrum of each type of gas in the Galactic All Sky Survey data\nreveals the dense population to have a typical line width of ~20 km/s and\nbrightness temperature of ~0.3 K, while the diffuse population has a typical\nline width of ~30 km/s and a brightness temperature of ~0.2 K. Our results\nconfirm that most surveys of high velocity gas in the Milky Way halo are\nmissing the majority of the ubiquitous diffuse gas, and that this gas is likely\nto contribute at least as much mass as the dense gas.\n", "  Based on regularities in rotational splittings, we seek possible multiplets\nfor the observed frequencies of CoRoT 102749568. Twenty-one sets of multiplets\nare identified, including four sets of multiplets with $l=1$, nine sets of\nmultiplets with $l=2$, and eight sets of multiplets with $l=3$. In particular,\nthere are three complete triplets ($f_{10}$, $f_{12}$, $f_{14}$), ($f_{31}$,\n$f_{34}$, $f_{35}$), and ($f_{41}$, $f_{43}$, $f_{44}$). The rotational period\nof CoRoT 102749568 is estimated to be $1.34^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ days. When doing\nmodel fittings, three $l=1$ modes ($f_{12}$, $f_{34}$, and $f_{43}$) and the\nradial first overtone $f_{13}$ are used. Our results shows that the three\nnonradial modes ($f_{12}$, $f_{34}$, and $f_{43}$) are mixed modes, which\nmainly provide constraints on the helium core. The radial first overtone\n$f_{13}$ mainly provides constraint on the stellar envelope. Hence the size of\nthe helium core of CoRoT 102749568 is determined to be $M_{\\rm He}$ = 0.148\n$\\pm$ 0.003 $M_{\\odot}$ and $R_{\\rm He}$ = 0.0581 $\\pm$ 0.0007 $R_{\\odot}$. The\nfundamental parameters of CoRoT 102749568 are determined to be $M$ = 1.54 $\\pm$\n0.03 $M_{\\odot}$, $Z=$ 0.006, $f_{\\rm ov}$ = 0.004 $\\pm$ 0.002, $\\log g$ =\n3.696 $\\pm$ 0.003, $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 6886 $\\pm$ 70 K, $R$ = 2.916 $\\pm$ 0.039\n$R_{\\odot}$, and $L$ = 17.12 $\\pm$ 1.13 $L_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum, 12CO, C18O, and SO data for the Class 0\nprotostars, Lupus 3 MMS, IRAS 15398-3559, and IRAS 16253-2429 at resolutions of\n~100 AU. By measuring a rotational profile in C18O, a 100 AU Keplerian disk\naround a 0.3 Msun protostar is observed in Lupus 3 MMS. No 100 AU Keplerian\ndisks are observed in IRAS 15398-3559 and IRAS 16253-2429. Nevertheless,\nembedded compact (<30 AU) continuum components are detected. The C18O emission\nin IRAS 15398-3559 shows signatures of infall with a constant angular momentum.\nIRAS 16253-2429 exhibits signatures of infall and rotation, but its rotational\nprofile is unresolved. By fitting the C18O data with our kinematic models, the\nprotostellar masses and the disk radii are inferred to be 0.01 Msun and 20 AU\nin IRAS 15398-3559, and 0.03 Msun and 6 AU in IRAS 16253-2429. By comparing the\nspecific angular momentum profiles from 10,000 to 100 AU in 8 Class 0 and I\nprotostars, we find that the evolution of envelope rotation can be described\nwith conventional inside-out collapse models. In comparison with a sample of 18\nprotostars with known disk radii, our results reveal signs of disk growth, with\nthe disk radius increasing as M*^{0.8+/-0.14} or t^{1.09+\\-0.37} in the Class 0\nstage, where M* is the protostellar mass and t is the age. The disk growth rate\nslows down in the Class I stage. Besides, we find a hint that the mass\naccretion rate declines as t^{-0.26+\\-0.04} from the Class 0 to I stages.\n", "  The role of magnetic fields in the early stages of star formation is not well\nconstrained. In order to discriminate between different star formation models,\nwe analyze 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low-mass cores and explore the\ncorrelation between magnetic field orientation and outflow orientation over\ntime. We produce synthetic observations of dust polarization at resolutions\ncomparable to millimeter-wave dust polarization maps observed by CARMA and\ncompare these with 2D visualizations of projected magnetic field and column\ndensity. Cumulative distribution functions of the projected angle between the\nmagnetic field and outflow show different degrees of alignment in simulations\nwith differing mass-to-flux ratios. The distribution function for the less\nmagnetized core agrees with observations finding random alignment between\noutflow and field orientations, while the more magnetized core exhibits\nstronger alignment. We find that fractional polarization increases when the\nsystem is viewed such that the magnetic field is close to the plane of the sky,\nand the values of fractional polarization are consistent with observational\nmeasurements. The simulation outflow, which reflects the underlying angular\nmomentum of the accreted gas, changes direction significantly over the first\n$\\sim0.1$ Myr of evolution. This movement could lead to the observed random\nalignment between outflows and the magnetic fields in protostellar cores.\n", "  We present ProFit, a new code for Bayesian two-dimensional photometric galaxy\nprofile modelling. ProFit consists of a low-level C++ library (libprofit),\naccessible via a command-line interface and documented API, along with\nhigh-level R (ProFit) and Python (PyProFit) interfaces (available at\ngithub.com/ICRAR/ libprofit, github.com/ICRAR/ProFit, and\ngithub.com/ICRAR/pyprofit respectively). R ProFit is also available pre-built\nfrom CRAN, however this version will be slightly behind the latest GitHub\nversion. libprofit offers fast and accurate two- dimensional integration for a\nuseful number of profiles, including Sersic, Core-Sersic, broken-exponential,\nFerrer, Moffat, empirical King, point-source and sky, with a simple mechanism\nfor adding new profiles. We show detailed comparisons between libprofit and\nGALFIT. libprofit is both faster and more accurate than GALFIT at integrating\nthe ubiquitous Serrsic profile for the most common values of the Serrsic index\nn (0.5 < n < 8).\n  The high-level fitting code ProFit is tested on a sample of galaxies with\nboth SDSS and deeper KiDS imaging. We find good agreement in the fit\nparameters, with larger scatter in best-fit parameters from fitting images from\ndifferent sources (SDSS vs KiDS) than from using different codes (ProFit vs\nGALFIT). A large suite of Monte Carlo-simulated images are used to assess\nprospects for automated bulge-disc decomposition with ProFit on SDSS, KiDS and\nfuture LSST imaging. We find that the biggest increases in fit quality come\nfrom moving from SDSS- to KiDS-quality data, with less significant gains moving\nfrom KiDS to LSST.\n", "  We revisit the massive isolated elliptical galaxy / fossil group NGC 6482 for\nwhich previous X-ray studies of a modest Chandra observation obtained a very\nuncertain, but also possibly very high, halo concentration. We present new\nmeasurements of the hot gas surface brightness, temperature, and iron abundance\nusing the modest Chandra observation and a previously unpublished Suzaku\nobservation, the latter of which allows measurements of the gas properties to\nbe extended out to ~r_2500. By constructing hydrostatic equilibrium models of\nthe gas with separate components for the gas, BCG stellar mass, and the dark\nmatter (DM), we measure c_200 = 32.2 +/- 7.1 and M_200 = (4.5 +/- 0.6 x 10^12\nM_sun using an NFW DM profile. For a halo of this mass, c_200 exceeds the mean\nvalue (7.1) expected for relaxed LCDM halos by $3.5 \\sigma$ in terms of the\nobservational error, and by $6 \\sigma$ considering the intrinsic scatter in the\nLCDM c-M relation, which situates NGC 6482 as the most extreme outlier known\nfor a fossil system. We explored several variants of adiabatic contraction (AC)\nmodels and, while the AC models provide fits of the same quality as the\nun-contracted models, they do have the following advantages: (1) smaller c_200\nthat is less of an outlier in the LCDM c-M relation, and (2) baryon fractions\nthat agree better with the mean cosmic value. While the standard AC\nprescriptions yield a BCG stellar mass that is uncomfortably small compared to\nresults from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, a weaker AC variant\nthat artificially shuts off cooling and star formation at z=2 yields the same\nstellar mass as the un-contracted models. For these reasons, we believe our\nX-ray analysis prefers this weaker AC variant applied to either an NFW or\nEinasto DM halo. Finally, the BCG stellar mass strongly favors SPS models with\na Chabrier or Kroupa IMF over a Salpeter IMF. (Abridged)\n", "  A parametrization of (super) moduli space near the corners corresponding to\nbosonic or Neveu-Schwarz open string degenerations is introduced for\nworldsheets of arbitrary topology. With this parametrization, Feynman graph\npolynomials arise as the $\\alpha ' \\to 0$ limit of objects on moduli space.\nFurthermore, the integration measures of string theory take on a very simple\nand elegant form.\n", "  Interstellar iron in the form of metallic iron nanoparticles may constitute a\ncomponent of the interstellar dust. We compute the stability of iron\nnanoparticles to sublimation in the interstellar radiation field, finding that\niron clusters can persist down to a radius of $\\simeq 4.5\\,$\\AA, and perhaps\nsmaller. We employ laboratory data on small iron clusters to compute the\nphotoelectric yields as a function of grain size and the resulting grain charge\ndistribution in various interstellar environments, finding that iron\nnanoparticles can acquire negative charges particularly in regions with high\ngas temperatures and ionization fractions. If $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ of the\ninterstellar iron is in the form of ultrasmall iron clusters, the photoelectric\nheating rate from dust may be increased by up to tens of percent relative to\ndust models with only carbonaceous and silicate grains.\n", "  We perform and analyze results of a global magnetohydrodyanmic (MHD)\nsimulation of the fast coronal mass ejection (CME) that occurred on 2011 March\n7. The simulation is made using the newly developed Alfv\\'en Wave Solar Model\n(AWSoM), which describes the background solar wind starting from the upper\nchromosphere and extends to 24 R$_{\\odot}$. Coupling AWSoM to an inner\nheliosphere (IH) model with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) extends\nthe total domain beyond the orbit of Earth. Physical processes included in the\nmodel are multi-species thermodynamics, electron heat conduction (both\ncollisional and collisionless formulations), optically thin radiative cooling,\nand Alfv\\'en-wave turbulence that accelerates and heats the solar wind. The\nAlfv\\'en-wave description is physically self-consistent, including\nnon-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) reflection and physics-based apportioning\nof turbulent dissipative heating to both electrons and protons. Within this\nmodel, we initiate the CME by using the Gibson-Low (GL) analytical flux rope\nmodel and follow its evolution for days, in which time it propagates beyond\nSTEREO A. A detailed comparison study is performed using remote as well as\n\\textit{in situ} observations. Although the flux rope structure is not compared\ndirectly due to lack of relevant ejecta observation at 1 AU in this event, our\nresults show that the new model can reproduce many of the observed features\nnear the Sun (e.g., CME-driven extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves, deflection of\nthe flux rope from the coronal hole, \"double-front\" in the white light images)\nand in the heliosphere (e.g., shock propagation direction, shock properties at\nSTEREO A).\n", "  The groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves produced by the\ninspiralling and coalescence of the black hole (BH) binary GW150914 confirms\nthe existence of \"heavy\" stellar-mass BHs with masses >25 Msun. Initial\nmodelling of the system by Abbott et al. (2016a) supposes that the formation of\nblack holes with such large masses from the evolution of single massive stars\nis only feasible if the wind mass-loss rates of the progenitors were greatly\nreduced relative to the mass-loss rates of massive stars in the Galaxy,\nconcluding that heavy BHs must form in low-metallicity (Z < 0.25-0.5 Zsun)\nenvironments. However, strong surface magnetic fields also provide a powerful\nmechanism for modifying mass loss and rotation of massive stars, independent of\nenvironmental metallicity (ud-Doula & Owocki 2002; ud-Doula et al. 2008). In\nthis paper we explore the hypothesis that some heavy BHs, with masses >25 Msun\nsuch as those inferred to compose GW150914, could be the natural end-point of\nevolution of magnetic massive stars in a solar-metallicity environment. Using\nthe MESA code, we developed a new grid of single, non-rotating, solar\nmetallicity evolutionary models for initial ZAMS masses from 40-80 Msun that\ninclude, for the first time, the quenching of the mass loss due to a realistic\ndipolar surface magnetic field. The new models predict TAMS masses that are\nsignificantly greater than those from equivalent non-magnetic models, reducing\nthe total mass lost by a strongly magnetized 80 Msun star during its main\nsequence evolution by 20 Msun. This corresponds approximately to the mass loss\nreduction expected from an environment with metallicity Z = 1/30 Zsun.\n", "  We report an early science discovery of the CO(1-0) emission line in the\ncollisional ring galaxy, VII Zw466, using the Redshift Search Receiver\ninstrument on the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano.The apparent\nmolecular-to-atomic gas ratio either places the ISM of VII Zw466 in the\nHI-dominated regime or implies a large quantity of CO-dark molecular gas, given\nits high star formation rate. The molecular gas densities and star formation\nrate densities of VII Zw466 are consistent with the standard Kennicutt-Schmidt\nstar formation law even though we find this galaxy to be H2-deficient. The\nchoice of CO-to-H2 conversion factors cannot explain the apparent H2 deficiency\nin its entirety. Hence, we find that the collisional ring galaxy, VII Zw466, is\neither largely deficient in both H2 and HI or contains a large mass of CO-dark\ngas. A low molecular gas fraction could be due to the enhancement of feedback\nprocesses from previous episodes of star formation as a result of the\nstar-forming ISM being confined to the ring. We conclude that collisional ring\ngalaxy formation is an extreme form of galaxy interaction that triggers a\nstrong galactic-wide burst of star formation that may provide immediate\nnegative feedback towards subsequent episodes of star formation---resulting in\na short-lived star formation history or, at least, the appearance of a\nmolecular gas deficit.\n", "  In a recent paper a toy model (called hypercubic model) undergoing a\nfirst-order $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking phase transition (SBPT) has been\nintroduced. The hypercubic model was inspired by the \\emph{topological\nhypothesis}, according to which a phase transition may be entailed by suitable\ntopological changes of the equipotential hypersurfaces $\\Sigma_v$ of\nconfiguration space. The $\\Sigma_v$'s of the hypercubic model have a single\ntopological change, which, under further particular hypotheses of geometric\nnature, entails the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPT. In this paper we introduce an extended\nversion of the hypercubic model in which no topological change in the\n$\\Sigma_v$'s is present anymore, but nevertheless the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPT\noccurs the same. We introduce a geometric property of the $\\Sigma_v$'s (i.e.\ndumbbell $\\Sigma_v$'s suitably defined) that is sufficient to entail a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-SBPT regardless their topology. The paper ends by applying the\npicture of the dumbbell $\\Sigma_v$'s to a physical model, i.e. the mean-field\n$\\phi^4$ model.\n", "  We present images and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of massive young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in three star-forming H II regions of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud: N159A, N159 Papillon, and N160. We use photometry from\nSOFIA/FORCAST at 25.3--37.1 um to constrain model fits to the SEDs and\ndetermine luminosities, ages, and dust content of the embedded YSOs and their\nlocal environments. By placing these sources on mid-infrared color-magnitude\nand color-color diagrams, we analyze their dust properties and consider their\nevolutionary status. Since each object in the FORCAST images has an obvious\nbright near-infrared counterpart in Spitzer Space Telescope images, we do not\nfind any evidence for new, very cool, previously-undiscovered Class 0 YSOs.\nAdditionally, based on its mid-infrared colors and model parameters, N159A is\nyounger than N160 and the Papillon. The nature of the first extragalactic\nprotostars in N159, P1 and P2, is also discussed.\n", "  We present the results of a spectroscopic survey to characterize\nchromospheric activity, as measured by H$\\alpha$ emission, in low-mass members\nof the 500-Myr-old open cluster M37. Combining our new measurements of\nH$\\alpha$ luminosities ($L_{H\\alpha}$) with previously cataloged stellar\nproperties, we identify saturated and unsaturated regimes in the dependence of\nthe $L_{H\\alpha}$-to-bolometric-luminosity ratio, $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$, on the\nRossby number $R_o$. All rotators with Ro smaller than 0.03$\\pm$0.01 converge\nto an activity level of $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$ = (1.27$\\pm$0.02) x 10$^{-4}$.\nThis saturation threshold ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\\pm$0.01) is statistically\nsmaller than that found in most studies of the rotation-activity relation. In\nthe unsaturated regime, slower rotators have lower levels of chromospheric\nactivity, with $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$($R_o$) following a power-law of index\n$\\beta$ = -0.51$\\pm$0.02, slightly shallower than the one found for a combined\n$\\approx$650-Myr-old sample of Hyades and Praesepe stars. By comparing this\nunsaturated behavior to that previously found for coronal activity in M37 (as\nmeasured via the X-ray luminosity, $L_X$), we confirm that chromospheric\nactivity decays at a much slower rate than coronal activity with increasing\n$R_o$. While a comparison of $L_{H\\alpha}$ and $L_X$ for M37 members with\nmeasurements of both reveals a nearly 1:1 relation, removing the\nmass-dependencies by comparing instead $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$ and $L_X/L_{bol}$\ndoes not provide clear evidence for such a relation. Finally, we find that\n$R_{o,sat}$ is smaller for our chromospheric than for our coronal indicator of\nactivity ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\\pm$0.01 versus 0.09$\\pm$0.01). We interpret this\nas possible evidence for coronal stripping.\n", "  We report on Gemini/GNIRS observations of the binary T Tauri system V582 Mon\n(KH 15D) at three orbital phases. These spectra allow us to untangle five\ncomponents of the system: the photosphere and magnetosphere of star B, the jet,\nscattering properties of the ring material, and excess near-IR radiation\npreviously attributed to a possible self-luminous planet. We confirm an early-K\nsubgiant classification for star B and show that the magnetospheric He I\nemission line is variable, possibly indicating increased mass accretion at\ncertain times. As expected, the H$_2$ emission features associated with the\ninner part of the jet show no variation with orbital phase. We show that the\nreflectance spectrum for the scattered light has a distinctive blue slope and\nspectral features consistent with scattering and absorption by a mixture of\nwater and methane ice grains in the 1-50 $\\mu$m size range. This suggests that\nthe methane frost line is closer than $\\sim$5 AU in this system, requiring that\nthe grains be shielded from direct radiation. After correcting for features\nfrom the scattered light, jet, magnetosphere, and photosphere, we confirm the\npresence of leftover near-IR light from an additional source, detectable near\nminimum brightness. A spectral emission feature matching the model spectrum of\na 10 M$_{J}$, 1 Myr old planet is found in the excess flux, but other expected\nfeatures from this model are not seen. Our observations, therefore, tentatively\nsupport the picture that a luminous planet is present within the system,\nalthough they cannot yet be considered definitive.\n", "  The dynamical processes involving stellar-remnant black holes (BH) in stellar\nclusters has always drawn attention due to the BHs' potential in a number of\nastrophysical phenomena, especially the dynamical formation of binary black\nholes (BBH), which would potentially coalesce via radiation of gravitational\nwaves (GW). This study presents a preliminary set of evolutionary models of\ncompact stellar clusters with initial masses ranging over\n$1.0\\times10^4M_\\odot-5.0\\times10^4M_\\odot$, and half-mass radius of 2 pc or 1\npc, that is typical for young massive and starburst clusters. They have\nmetallicities between $0.05Z_\\odot-Z_\\odot$. Including contemporary schemes for\nstellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the\nfirst time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,\nuntil their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood. Among the\nBBH coalescences obtained here, there are ones that resemble the detected\nGW151226, LVT151012, and GW150914 events and also ones which are even more\nmassive. A preliminary estimate suggests few 10s - 100s of BBH coalescences per\nyear, originating due to dynamics in stellar clusters, that can be detected by\nthe LIGO at its design sensitivity.\n", "  Distance uncertainties plague our understanding of the physical scales\nrelevant to the physics of star formation in extragalactic studies. The\nplanetary nebulae luminosity function (PNLF) is one of very few techniques that\ncan provide distance estimates to within ~10%, however it requires a planetary\nnebula (PN) sample that is uncontaminated by other ionizing sources. We employ\noptical IFU spectroscopy using MUSE on the VLT to measure [OIII] line fluxes\nfor sources unresolved on 50 pc scales within the central star-forming galaxy\ndisk of NGC 628. We use diagnostic line ratios to identify 62 PNe, 30 supernova\nremnants and 87 HII regions within our fields. Using the 36 brightest PNe we\ndetermine a new PNLF distance modulus of 29.91^{+0.08}_{-0.13} mag\n(9.59^{+0.35}_{-0.57} Mpc), in good agreement with literature values but\nsignificantly larger than the previously reported PNLF distance. We are able to\nexplain the discrepancy and recover the previous result when we reintroduce SNR\ncontaminants to our sample. This demonstrates the power of full spectral\ninformation over narrowband imaging in isolating PNe. Given our limited spatial\ncoverage within the galaxy, we show that this technique can be used to refine\ndistance estimates even when IFU observations cover only a fraction of a galaxy\ndisk.\n", "  We present a pilot study on the nearby massive barred galaxy NGC 1291, in\nwhich we use dynamical modelling to constrain the disc mass-to-light ratio\n(M/L), thus breaking the degeneracy between the baryonic and dark matter in its\ncentral regions. We use the gas, specifically the morphology of the dust lanes\non the leading side of the bar, as a tracer of the underlying gravitational\npotential. We run a large number of hydrodynamic gas response simulations, in\npotentials obtained directly from near-infrared images of the galaxy, which\nhave three free parameters: the M/L, the bar pattern speed and the height\nfunction. We explore the three-dimensional parameter space, by comparing the\nmorphology of the shocks created in the gas response simulations with those of\nthe observed dust lanes, and find the best-fitting models; these suggest that\nthe M/L of NGC 1291 agrees with that predicted by stellar population synthesis\nmodels in the near-infrared ($\\approx$0.6\\,$M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$), which leads\nto a borderline maximum disc for this galaxy. Furthermore, we find that the bar\nrotates fast, with a corotation radius which is $\\leq$ 1.4 times the bar\nlength.\n", "  The effective temperature (Teff) of the radiation field of the ionizing\nstar(s) of a large sample of extragalactic HII regions was estimated using the\nR= log([OII](3727)/[OIII]5007) index. We used a grid of photoionization models\nto calibrate the Teff-R relation finding that it has a strong dependence with\nthe ionizing parameter while it shows a weak direct dependence with the\nmetallicity (variations in Z imply variations in U) of both the stellar\natmosphere of the ionizing star and the gas phase of the HII region. Since the\nR index varies slightly with the Teff for values larger than 40 kK, the R index\ncan be used to derive the Teff in 30-40 kK range. A large fraction of the\nionization parameter variation is due to differences in the temperature of the\nionizing stars and then the use of the (relatively) low Teff dependent S2=[S\nII](6717+31)/Ha emission-line ratio to derive the ionization parameter is\npreferable over others in the literature. We propose linear metallicity\ndependent relationships between S2 and U. Teff and metallicity estimations for\na sample of 865 HII regions, whose emission-line intensities were compiled from\nthe literature, do not show any Teff-Z correlation. On the other hand it seems\nto be hints of the presence of an anti-correlation between Teff-U. We found\nthat the majority of the studied HII regions (87%) present Teff values in the\nrange between 37 and 40 kK, with an average value of 38.5 kK. We also studied\nthe variation of Teff as a function of the galactocentric distance for 14\nspiral galaxies. Our results are in agreement with the idea of the existence of\npositive Teff gradients along the disk of spiral galaxies.\n", "  4U 0142+61 is one of a small class of persistently bright magnetars. Here we\nreport on a monitoring campaign of 4U 0142+61 from 2011 July 26 - 2016 June 12\nusing the Swift X-ray Telescope, continuing a 16 year timing campaign with the\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We show that 4U 0142+61 had two radiatively loud\ntiming events, on 2011 July 29 and 2015 February 28, both with short soft\ngamma-ray bursts, and a long-lived flux decay associated with each case. We\nshow that the 2015 timing event resulted in a net spin-down of the pulsar due\nto over-recovery of a glitch. We compare this timing event to previous such\nevents in other high-magnetic-field pulsars, and discuss net spin-down glitches\nnow seen in several young, high-B pulsars.\n", "  We report the multi-epoch detections of the water ice in 2.8-4.2 micron\nspectra of two Herbig Ae stars, PDS 144N (A2 IVe) and PDS 453 (F2 Ve), which\nhave an edge-on circumstellar disk. The detected water ice absorption is found\nto originate from their protoplanetary disks. The spectra show a relatively\nshallow absorption of water ice around 3.1 micron for both objects. The optical\ndepths of the water ice absorption are ~0.1 and ~0.2 for PDS 144N and PDS 453,\nrespectively. Compared to the water ice previously detected in low-mass young\nstellar objects with an edge-on disk with a similar inclination angle, these\noptical depths are significantly lower. It suggests that stronger UV radiation\nfrom the central stars effectively decreases the water ice abundance around the\nHerbig Ae stars through photodesorption. The water ice absorption in PDS 453\nshows a possible variation of the feature among the six observing epochs. This\nvariation could be due to a change of absorption materials passing through our\nline-of-sight to the central star.\n", "  In the Milky Way there are thousands of stellar clusters each harboring from\na hundred to a million stars. Although clusters are common, the initial\nconditions of cluster formation are still not well understood. To determine the\nprocesses involved in the formation and evolution of clusters it is key to\ndetermine the global properties of cluster-forming clumps in their earliest\nstages of evolution. Here, we present the physical properties of 1,244 clumps\nidentified from the MALT90 survey. Using the dust temperature of the clumps as\na proxy for evolution we determined how the clump properties change at\ndifferent evolutionary stages. We find that less-evolved clumps exhibiting dust\ntemperatures lower than 20 K have higher densities and are more gravitationally\nbound than more-evolved clumps with higher dust temperatures. We also\nidentified a sample of clumps in a very early stage of evolution, thus\npotential candidates for high-mass star-forming clumps. Only one clump in our\nsample has physical properties consistent with a young massive cluster\nprogenitor, reinforcing the fact that massive proto-clusters are very rare in\nthe Galaxy.\n", "  This paper presents a study of the chemical compositions in cool gas around a\nsample of 27 intermediate-redshift galaxies. The sample comprises 13 massive\nquiescent galaxies at z=0.40-0.73 probed by QSO sightlines at projected\ndistances d=3-400 kpc, and 14 star-forming galaxies at z=0.10-1.24 probed by\nQSO sightlines at d=8-163 kpc. The main goal of this study is to examine the\nradial profiles of the gas-phase Fe/{\\alpha} ratio in galaxy halos based on the\nobserved Fe II to Mg II column density ratios. Because Mg+ and Fe+ share\nsimilar ionization potentials, the relative ionization correction is small in\nmoderately ionized gas and the observed ionic abundance ratio N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)\nplaces a lower limit to the underlying (Fe/Mg) elemental abundance ratio. For\nquiescent galaxies, a median and dispersion of log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n=-0.06+/-0.15 is found at d<~60 kpc, which declines to log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n<-0.3 at d>~100 kpc. On the other hand, star-forming galaxies exhibit log <N(Fe\nII)/N(Mg II)> =-0.25+/-0.21 at d<~60 kpc and log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n=-0.9+/-0.4 at larger distances. Including possible differential dust depletion\nor ionization correction would only increase the inferred (Fe/Mg) ratio. The\nobserved N(FeII)/N(Mg II) implies super-solar Fe/{\\alpha} ratios in the inner\nhalo of quiescent galaxies. An enhanced Fe abundance indicates a substantial\ncontribution by Type Ia supernovae in the chemical enrichment, which is at\nleast comparable to what is observed in the solar neighborhood or in\nintracluster media but differs from young star-forming regions. In the outer\nhalos of quiescent galaxies and in halos around star-forming galaxies, however,\nthe observed N(Fe II)/N(Mg II) is consistent with an {\\alpha}-element enhanced\nenrichment pattern, suggesting a core-collapse supernovae dominated enrichment\nhistory.\n", "  Determining neutron star (NS) radii and masses can help to understand the\nproperties of matter at supra-nuclear densities. Thermal emission during\nthermonuclear X-ray bursts from NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries provides a\nunique opportunity to study NS parameters, because of the high fluxes, large\nluminosity variations and the related changes in the spectral properties. The\nstandard cooling tail method uses hot NS atmosphere models to convert the\nobserved spectral evolution during cooling stages of X-ray bursts to the\nEddington flux F_Edd and the stellar angular size \\Omega. These are then\ntranslated to the constraints on the NS mass M and radius R. Here we present\nthe improved, direct cooling tail method that generalises the standard\napproach. First, we adjust the cooling tail method to account for the\nbolometric correction to the flux. Then, we fit the observed dependence of the\nblackbody normalization on flux with a theoretical model directly on the M-R\nplane by interpolating theoretical dependences to a given gravity, hence\nensuring only weakly informative priors for M and R instead of F_Edd and\n\\Omega.\n  The direct cooling method is demonstrated using a photospheric radius\nexpansion burst from SAX J1810.8--2609, which has happened when the system was\nin the hard state. Comparing to the standard cooling tail method, the\nconfidence regions are shifted by 1 sigma towards larger radii, giving\nR=11.5-13.0 km at M=1.3-1.8 M_sun for this NS.\n", "  We investigate the nature of so-called low $T/W$ dynamical instability in a\ndifferentially rotating star by focusing on the role played by the corotation\nradius of the unstable oscillation modes. An one dimensional model of linear\nperturbation, which neglects dependence of variables on the coordinate along\nthe rotational axis of the star, is solved to obtain stable and unstable\neigenmodes. A linear eigenmode having a corotation radius, at which azimuthal\npattern speed of the mode coincides with the stellar angular velocity, is\ncategorized to either a complex (growing or damping) mode or a purely real mode\nbelonging to a continuous spectrum of frequency. We compute canonical angular\nmomentum and its flux to study eigenmodes with corotation radius. In a\ndynamically unstable mode, sound wave transports its angular momentum in such a\nway that the absolute value of the angular momentum is increased on both sides\nof the corotation radius. We further evaluate growth of amplitude of reflected\nsound wave incident to a corotation point and find that the over-reflection of\nthe wave and the trapping of it between the corotation radius and the surface\nof the star may qualitatively explain dependences of eigenfrequencies on the\nstellar differential rotation. The results suggest that the low $T/W$\ninstability may be caused by over-reflection of sound waves trapped mainly\nbetween the surface of the star and a corotation radius.\n", "  We describe a sub-galactic main sequence (SGMS) relating star formation rate\nsurface density ($\\Sigma_{\\textrm{SFR}}$) and stellar mass density\n($\\Sigma_{\\star}$) for distinct regions within star forming galaxies, including\ntheir nuclei. We use a sample of 246 nearby star-forming galaxies from the\n\"Star Formation Reference Survey\" and demonstrate that the SGMS holds down to $\n\\sim $1 kpc scales with a slope of $\\alpha=0.91$ and a dispersion of 0.31 dex,\nsimilar to the well-known main sequence (MS) measured for globally integrated\nstar formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses. The SGMS slope depends on\ngalaxy morphology, with late-type galaxies (Sc$-$Irr) having $\\alpha = 0.97$\nand early-type spirals (Sa$-$Sbc) having $\\alpha = 0.81$. The SGMS constructed\nfrom sub-regions of individual galaxies has on average the same characteristics\nas the composite SGMS from all galaxies. The SGMS for galaxy nuclei shows a\ndispersion similar to that seen for other sub-regions. Sampling a limited range\nof SFR$-$M$_{\\star} $ space may produce either sub-linearity or super-linearity\nof the SGMS slope. For nearly all galaxies, both SFR and stellar mass peak in\nthe nucleus, indicating that circumnuclear clusters are among the most actively\nstar-forming regions in the galaxy and the most massive. The nuclear SFR also\ncorrelates with total galaxy mass, forming a distinct sequence from the\nstandard MS of star-formation. The nuclear main sequence will be useful for\nstudying bulge growth and for characterizing feedback processes connecting AGN\nand star formation.\n", "  We report on the redshift of the BL Lac object 3FGL J0909.0+2310 based on\nobservations obtained with the OSIRIS Multi Object Spectrograph (MOS) mounted\non the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. A redshift of 0.432+/-0.002 was\nobtained by the identification of three absorption features (CaII K&H and\nG-band) detected in the spectrum of the BL Lac host galaxy. The closest object\nto the BL Lac at an angular separation of 3.8\" (~21 kpc at this distance) has a\nsimilar redshift of 0.431+/-0.002. This companion galaxy could be the most\nlikely cause of the nuclear activity as postulated by studies based on more\nextended data sets and cosmological models. MOS allows us to study the object's\nneighbourhood within a field of view of approximately 7'x2' and we find two\nsmall groups of galaxies at redshifts 0.28 and 0.39 which are probably not\nrelated to the activity of 3FGL~J0909.0+2310.\n", "  The recent discovery of an earth-like planet around Proxima Centauri has\ndrawn much attention to this star and its environment. We performed a series of\nobservations of Proxima Centauri using SPHERE, the planet finder instrument\ninstalled at the ESO Very Large Telescope UT3, using its near infrared modules,\nIRDIS and IFS. No planet was directly detected but we set upper limits on the\nmass up to 7 au exploiting the AMES-COND models. Our IFS observations reveal\nthat no planet more massive than ~6-7 M Jup can be present within 1 au. The\ndual band imaging camera IRDIS also enables us to probe larger separations than\nthe other techniques like the radial velocity or astrometry. We obtained mass\nlimits of the order of 4 M Jup at separations of 2 au or larger representing\nthe most stringent mass limits at separations larger than 5 au available at the\nmoment. We also did an attempt to estimate the radius of possible planets\naround Proxima using the reflected light. Since the residual noise for this\nobservations are dominated by photon noise and thermal background, longer\nexposures in good observing conditions could further improve the achievable\ncontrast limit.\n", "  We have extended the time baseline for observations of the proper motions of\nradio sources in the Orion BN/KL region from 14.7 to 22.5 years. We present\nimproved determinations for the sources BN and I. In addition, we address the\nproper motions of the double radio source n, that have been questioned in the\nliterature. We confirm that all three sources are moving away at transverse\nvelocities of tens of km s$^{-1}$ from a region in-between them, where they\nwere located about 500 years ago. Source n exhibits a new component that we\ninterpret as due to a one-sided ejection of free-free emitting plasma that took\nplace after 2006.36. We used the highly accurate relative proper motions\nbetween sources BN and I to determine that their closest separation took place\nin the year 1475$\\pm$6, when they were within $\\sim$100 AU or less from each\nother in the plane of the sky.\n", "  The merger of close double white dwarfs (CDWDs) is one of the favourite\nevolutionary channels for producing Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). Unfortunately,\ncurrent theories of the evolution and formation of CDWDs are still poorly\nconstrained and have several serious uncertainties, which affect the predicted\nSN Ia rates. Moreover, current observational constraints on this evolutionary\npathway for SN Ia mainly rely on only 18 double-lined and/or eclipsing CDWDs\nwith measured orbital and stellar parameters for both white dwarfs. In this\npaper we present the orbital periods and the individual masses of three new\ndouble-lined CDWDs, derived using a new method. This method employs mass\nratios, the Halpha core ratios and spectral model-fitting to constrain the\nmasses of the components of the pair. The three CDWDs are WD0028-474\n(Porb=9.350 +- 0.007 hours, M1=0.60 +- 0.06 Msun, M2=0.45 +- 0.04 Msun),\nHE0410-1137 (Porb = 12.208 +- 0.008 hours, M1= 0.51 +- 0.04 Msun, M2= 0.39 +-\n0.03 Msun) and SDSSJ031813.25-010711.7 (Porb = 45.908 +- 0.006 hours, among the\nlongest period systems, M1= 0.40 +- 0.05 Msun, M2= 0.49 +- 0.05 Msun). While\nthe three systems studied here will merge in timescales longer than the Hubble\ntime and are expected to become single massive (>~0.9 Msun) white dwarfs rather\nthan exploding as SN Ia, increasing the small sample of CDWDs with determined\nstellar parameters is crucial for a better overall understanding of their\nevolution.\n", "  We present a comprehensive UBVRI and Washington CT1T2 photometric analysis of\nseven catalogued open clusters, namely: Ruprecht 3, 9, 37, 74, 150, ESO 324-15\nand 436-2. The multi-band photometric data sets in combination with 2MASS\nphotometry and Gaia astrometry for the brighter stars were used to estimate\ntheir structural parameters and fundamental astrophysical properties. We found\nthat Ruprecht 3 and ESO 436-2 do not show self-consistent evidence of being\nphysical systems. The remained studied objects are open clusters of\nintermediate-age (9.0 < log(t yr-1) < 9.6), of relatively small size (r_cls ~\n0.4 - 1.3 pc) and placed between 0.6 and 2.9 kpc from the Sun. We analized the\nrelationships between core, half-mass, tidal and Jacoby radii as well as\nhalf-mass relaxation times to conclude that the studied clusters are in an\nevolved dynamical stage. The cluster masses obtained by summing those of the\nobserved cluster stars resulted to be ~ 10-15 per cent of the masses of open\nclusters of similar age located closer than 2 kpc from the Sun. We found that\ncluster stars occupy volumes as large as those for tidally filled clusters.\n", "  We present an analysis of the close double degenerate NLTT 12758, which is\ncomprised of a magnetic white dwarf with a field of about 3.1 MG and an\napparently non-magnetic white dwarf. We measured an orbital period of 1.154\ndays and found that the magnetic white dwarf is spinning around its axis with a\nperiod of 23 minutes. An analysis of the atmospheric parameters has revealed\nthat the cooling ages of the two white dwarfs are comparable, suggesting that\nthey formed within a short period of time from each other. Our modelling\nindicates that the non-magnetic white dwarf is more massive (M=0.83 M_sun) than\nits magnetic companion (M=0.69 M_sun) and that the total mass of the system is\nhigher than the Chandrasekhar mass. Although the stars will not come into\ncontact over a Hubble time, when they do come into contact, dynamically\nunstable mass transfer will take place leading to either an accretion induced\ncollapse into a rapidly spinning neutron star or a Type Ia supernova.\n", "  We introduce the concept of a class of equivalence of molecular clouds\nrepresented by an abstract spherically symmetric, isotropic object. This object\nis described by use of abstract scales in respect to a given mass density\ndistribution. Mass and average density are ascribed to each scale and thus are\nlinked to the density distribution: a power-law type and an arbitrary\ncontinuous one. In the latter case, we derive a differential relationship\nbetween the mean density at a given scale and the structure parameter which\ndefines the mass-density relationship. The two-dimensional (2D) projection of\nthe cloud along the line of sight is also investigated. Scaling relations of\nmass and mean density are derived in the considered cases of power-law and\narbitrary continuous distributions. We obtain relations between scaling\nexponents in the 2D and 3D cases. The proposed classes of equivalence are\nrepresentative for the general structure of real clouds with various types of\ncolumn-density distributions: power law, lognormal or combination of both.\n", "  We present adaptive optics (AO) assisted SINFONI integral field unit (IFU)\nspectroscopy of eleven H$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies selected from the High-Z\nEmission Line Survey (HiZELS). We obtain spatially resolved dynamics on\n~kpc-scales of star-forming galaxies (stellar mass M$_\\star$ = 10$^{9.5-10.5}$\nM$_\\odot$ and star formation rate SFR = 2-30 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) near the peak\nof the cosmic star-formation rate history. Combining these observations with\nour previous SINFONI-HiZELS campaign, we construct a sample of twenty\nhomogeneously selected galaxies with IFU AO-aided observations -- the `SHiZELS'\nsurvey, with roughly equal number of galaxies per redshift slice, at $z$ = 0.8,\n1.47, and 2.23. We measure the dynamics and identify the major kinematic axis\nby modelling their velocity fields to extract rotational curves and infer their\ninclination-corrected rotational velocities. We explore the stellar mass\nTully-Fisher relationship, finding that galaxies with higher velocity\ndispersions tend to deviate from this relation. Using kinemetry analyses we\nfind that galaxy interactions might be the dominant mechanism controlling the\nstar-formation activity at $z$ = 2.23 but they become gradually less important\ndown to $z$ = 0.8. Metallicity gradients derived from the [NII]/H$\\alpha$\nemission line ratio show a median negative gradient for the SHiZELS survey of\n$\\Delta$log(O/H)/$\\Delta$R = -0.026$\\pm$0.008 dex kpc$^{-1}$. We find that\nmetal-rich galaxies tend to show negative gradients, whereas metal-poor\ngalaxies tend to exhibit positive metallicity gradients. This result suggests\nthat the accretion of pristine gas in the periphery of galaxies plays an\nimportant role in replenishing the gas in `typical' star-forming galaxies.\n", "  The supernova remnant (SNR) N49B in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a peculiar\nexample of a core-collapse SNR to show the shocked metal-rich ejecta enriched\nonly in Mg without evidence for a similar overabundance in O and Ne. Based on\narchival Chandra data we present results from our extensive spatially-resolved\nspectral analysis of N49B. We find that the Mg-rich ejecta gas extends from the\ncentral regions of the SNR out to the southeastern outermost boundary of the\nSNR. This elongated feature shows an overabundance for Mg similar to that of\nthe main ejecta region at the SNR center, and its electron temperature appears\nto be higher than the central main ejecta gas. We estimate that the Mg mass in\nthis southeastern elongated ejecta feature is ~10% of the total Mg ejecta mass.\nOur estimated lower limit of >0.1 M_sun on the total mass of the Mg-rich ejecta\nconfirms the previously-suggested large mass for the progenitor star (M > ~25\nM_sun). We entertain scenarios of an SNR expanding into a non-uniform medium\nand an energetic jet-driven supernova in an attempt to interpret these results.\nHowever, with the current results, the origins of the extended Mg-rich ejecta\nand the Mg-only-rich nature of the overall metal-rich ejecta in this SNR remain\nelusive.\n", "  We analyze the emission line profiles detected in deep optical spectra of\nquasars to derive the mass of their super-massive black holes (SMBH) following\nthe single-epoch virial method. Our sample consists in 6 radio-loud quasars and\n4 radio-quiet quasars. We carefully fit a broad and narrow Gaussian component\nfor each emission line in both the H$\\beta$ (10 objects) and H$\\alpha$ regions\n(5 objects). A very good agreement of the derived SMBH masses, $M_{\\rm SMBH}$,\nis found using the fitted broad H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ emission lines. We\ncompare our $M_{\\rm SMBH}$ results with those found by previous studies. We\nstudy the relationship between the $M_{\\rm SMBH}$ of the quasar and the stellar\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{*}$, of the host galaxy. We use the measured\n$M_{\\rm SMBH}$ and $\\sigma_{*}$ to investigate the $M_{\\rm SMBH}$ -\n$\\sigma_{*}$ relation for both the radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples.\nBesides the scatter, we find a good agreement between radio-quiet quasars and\nAGN+quiescent galaxies and between radio-loud quasars and AGN. Our analysis\ndoes not support the hypothesis of using $\\sigma$([O III] $\\lambda$5007) as a\nsurrogate for stellar velocity dispersions in high-mass, high-luminosity\nquasars. We also investigate the relationship between the 5 GHz radio-continuum\nluminosity, $L_{\\rm~5\\,GHz}$, of the quasar host galaxy with both $M_{\\rm\nSMBH}$ and $\\sigma_{*}$. We do not find any correlation between $L_{\\rm\n5\\,GHz}$ and $M_{\\rm SMBH}$, although we observe a trend that galaxies with\nlarger stellar velocity dispersions have larger $L_{\\rm 5\\,GHz}$. Using the\nresults of our fitting for the narrow emission lines of [O III] $\\lambda$5007\nand [N II] $\\lambda$6583 we estimate the gas-phase oxygen abundance of six\nquasars, being sub-solar in all cases.\n", "  The daytime sky has been recently demonstrated as a useful calibration tool\nfor deriving polarization cross-talk properties of large astronomical\ntelescopes. The Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) and other large\ntelescopes under construction can benefit from precise polarimetric calibration\nof large mirrors. Several atmospheric phenomena and instrumental errors\npotentially limit the techniques accuracy. At the 3.67m AEOS telescope on\nHaleakala, we have performed a large observing campaign with the HiVIS\nspectropolarimeter to identify limitations and develop algorithms for\nextracting consistent calibrations. Effective sampling of the telescope optical\nconfigurations and filtering of data for several derived parameters provide\nrobustness to the derived Mueller matrix calibrations. Second-order scattering\nmodels of the sky show that this method is relatively insensitive to\nmultiple-scattering in the sky provided calibration observations are done in\nregions of high polarization degree. The technique is also insensitive to\nassumptions about telescope induced polarization provided the mirror coatings\nare highly reflective. Zemax-derived polarization models show agreement between\nthe functional dependence of polarization predictions and the corresponding\non-sky calibrations.\n", "  We present simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud Be/XRB IGR J01217-7257 (=SXP 2.16) during outbursts in 2014,\n2015 and 2016. We also present the results of RXTE observations of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud during which the source was initially discovered with a\nperiodicity of 2.1652$\\pm$0.0001 seconds which we associate with the spin\nperiod of the neutron star. A systematic temporal analysis of long term\nSwift/BAT data reveals a periodic signal of 82.5$\\pm$0.7 days, in contrast with\na similar analysis of long base line OGLE I-band light curves which reveals an\n83.67$\\pm$0.05 days also found in this work. Interpreting the longer X-ray\nperiodicity as indicative of binary motion of the neutron star, we find that\noutbursts detected by INTEGRAL and Swift between 2014 and 2016 are consistent\nwith Type I outbursts seen in Be/XRBs, occurring around periastron. Comparing\nthese outbursts with the OGLE data, we see a clear correlation between outburst\noccurrence and increasing I-band flux. A periodic analysis of subdivisions of\nOGLE data reveals three epochs during which short periodicities of $\\sim$1 day\nare significantly detected which we suggest are non-radial pulsations (NRPs) of\nthe companion star. These seasons immediately precede those exhibiting clear\noutburst behaviour, supporting the suggested association between the NRPs,\ndecretion disk growth and the onset of Type I outbursts.\n", "  We present a new training set for estimating empirical photometric redshifts\nof galaxies, which was created as part of the 2dFLenS project. This training\nset is located in a 700 sq deg area of the KiDS South field and is randomly\nselected and nearly complete at r<19.5. We investigate the photometric redshift\nperformance obtained with ugriz photometry from VST-ATLAS and W1/W2 from WISE,\nbased on several empirical and template methods. The best redshift errors are\nobtained with kernel-density estimation, as are the lowest biases, which are\nconsistent with zero within statistical noise. The 68th percentiles of the\nredshift scatter for magnitude-limited samples at r<(15.5, 17.5, 19.5) are\n(0.014, 0.017, 0.028). In this magnitude range, there are no known ambiguities\nin the colour-redshift map, consistent with a small rate of redshift outliers.\nIn the fainter regime, the KDE method produces p(z) estimates per galaxy that\nrepresent unbiased and accurate redshift frequency expectations. The p(z) sum\nover any subsample is consistent with the true redshift frequency plus Poisson\nnoise. Further improvements in redshift precision at r<20 would mostly be\nexpected from filter sets with narrower passbands to increase the sensitivity\nof colours to small changes in redshift.\n", "  Accounting for stellar activity is a crucial component of the search for\never-smaller planets orbiting stars of all spectral types. We use Doppler\nimaging methods to demonstrate that starspot induced radial velocity\nvariability can be effectively reduced for moderately rotating, fully\nconvective stars. Using starspot distributions extrapolated from sunspot\nobservations, we adopt typical M dwarf starspot distributions with low contrast\nspots to synthesise line profile distortions. The distortions are recovered\nusing maximum entropy regularised fitting and the corresponding stellar radial\nvelocities are measured. The procedure is demonstrated for a late-M star\nharbouring an orbiting planet in the habitable zone. The technique is effective\nfor stars with vsini = 1-10 km/s, reducing the stellar noise contribution by\nfactors of nearly an order of magnitude. With a carefully chosen observing\nstrategy, the technique can be used to determine the stellar rotation period\nand is robust to uncertainties such as unknown stellar inclination. While\ndemonstrated for late-type M stars, the procedure is applicable to all spectral\ntypes.\n", "  Using a spectral analysis of bright Chandra X-ray sources located in 27\nnearby galaxies and maps of star-formation rate (SFR) and ISM surface densities\nfor these galaxies, we constructed the intrinsic X-ray luminosity function\n(XLF) of luminous high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), taking into account\nabsorption effects and the diversity of HMXB spectra. The XLF per unit SFR can\nbe described by a power law dN/d log L=2.0(L/10^39 erg/s)^(-0.6)\n(M_Sun/yr)^(-1) from L=10^38 to 10^40.5 erg/s, where L is the unabsorbed\nluminosity at 0.25-8 keV. The intrinsic number of luminous HMXBs per unit SFR\nis a factor of ~2.3 larger than the observed number reported before. The\nintrinsic XLF is composed of hard, soft and supersoft sources (defined here as\nthose with the 0.25-2 keV to 0.25-8 keV flux ratio of <0.6, 0.6-0.95 and >0.95,\nrespectively) in ~2:1:1 proportion. We also constructed the intrinsic HMXB XLF\nin the soft X-ray band (0.25-2 keV). Here, the numbers of hard, soft and\nsupersoft sources prove to be nearly equal. The cumulative present-day 0.25-2\nkeV emissivity of HMXBs with luminosities between 10^38 and 10^40.5 erg/s is ~5\n10^39 erg/s (M_Sun/yr)^(-1), which may be relevant for studying the X-ray\npreheating of the early Universe.\n", "  We study multi-wavelength variability of a bare Seyfert 1 galaxy Fairall~9\nusing \\swift{} monitoring observations consisting of $165$ usable pointings\nspanning nearly two years and covering six UV/optical bands and X-rays.\nFairall~9 is highly variable in all bands though the variability amplitude\ndecreases from X-ray to optical bands. The variations in the X-ray and\nUV/optical bands are strongly correlated. Our reverberation mapping analysis\nusing the {\\tt JAVALIN} tool shows that the variation in the UV/optical bands\nlag behind the variations in the X-ray band by $\\sim 2-10{\\rm~days}$. These lag\nmeasurements strongly suggest that the optical/UV variations are mainly caused\nby variations in the X-rays, and the origin of most of the optical/UV emission\nis X-ray reprocessing. The observed lags are found to vary as\n$\\tau\\propto\\lambda^{1.36\\pm0.13}$, consistent with the prediction,\n$\\tau\\propto\\lambda^{4/3}$, for X-ray reprocessing in a standard accretion\ndisc. However, the predicted lags for an standard accretion disc with X-ray\nreprocessing using black hole mass ($M_{BH} \\sim 2.6\\times10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$)\nestimated from the reverberation mapping of broad emission lines and accretion\nrate relative to the Eddington rate ($\\dot{m_E} =0.02$) are shorter than the\nobserved lags. These observations suggest that accretion disc in Fairall~9 is\nlarger than that predicted by the standard disc model, and confirm similar\nfindings in a few other Seyfert 1 galaxies such as NGC~5548.\n", "  The evolutionary status of the chemically peculiar class of $\\lambda$ Boo\nstars has been intensely debated. It is now agreed that the $\\lambda$ Boo\nphenomenon affects A stars of all ages, from star formation to the terminal age\nmain sequence, but the cause of the chemical peculiarity is still a puzzle. We\nrevisit the debate of their ages and temperatures in order to shed light on the\nphenomenon, using the new parallaxes in Gaia Data Release 1 with existing\nHipparcos parallaxes and multicolour photometry. We find that no single\nformation mechanism is able to explain all the observations, and suggest that\nthere are multiple channels producing $\\lambda$ Boo spectra. The relative\nimportance of these channels varies with age, temperature and environment.\n", "  We study the redshift evolution of the quasar UV Luminosity Function (LF) for\n0.5 < z < 6.5, by collecting the most up to date observational data and, in\nparticular, the recently discovered population of faint AGNs. We fit the QSO LF\nusing either a double power-law or a Schechter function, finding that both\nforms provide good fits to the data. We derive empirical relations for the LF\nparameters as a function of redshift and, based on these results, predict the\nquasar UV LF at z=8. From the inferred LF evolution, we compute the redshift\nevolution of the QSO/AGN comoving ionizing emissivity and hydrogen\nphotoionization rate. If faint AGNs are included, the contribution of quasars\nto reionization increases substantially. However, their level of contribution\ncritically depends on the detailed shape of the QSO LF, which can be\nconstrained by efficient searches of high-z quasars. To this aim, we predict\nthe expected (i) number of z>6 quasars detectable by ongoing and future NIR\nsurveys (as EUCLID and WFIRST), and (ii) number counts for a single\nradio-recombination line observation with SKA-MID (FoV = 0.49 deg^2) as a\nfunction of the Hnalpha flux density, at 0<z<8. These surveys (even at z<6)\nwill be fundamental to better constrain the role of quasars as reionization\nsources.\n", "  We study the internal gradients of stellar population properties within\n$1.5\\;R_{\\rm e}$ for a representative sample of 721 galaxies with stellar\nmasses ranging between $10^{9}\\;M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}\\;M_{\\odot}$ from the\nSDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. Through the use of our full spectral fitting code\nFIREFLY, we derive light and mass-weighted stellar population properties and\ntheir radial gradients, as well as full star formation and metal enrichment\nhistories. We also quanfify the impact that different stellar population models\nand full spectral fitting routines have on the derived stellar population\nproperties, and the radial gradient measurements. In our analysis, we find that\nage gradients tend to be shallow for both early-type and late-type galaxies.\n{\\em Mass-weighted} age gradients of early-types are positive ($\\sim 0.09\\;\n{\\rm dex}/R_{\\rm e}$) pointing to \"outside-in\" progression of star formation,\nwhile late-type galaxies have negative {\\em light-weighted} age gradients\n($\\sim -0.11\\; {\\rm dex}/R_{\\rm e}$), suggesting an \"inside-out\" formation of\ndiscs. We detect negative metallicity gradients in both early and late-type\ngalaxies, but these are significantly steeper in late-types, suggesting that\nradial dependence of chemical enrichment processes and the effect of gas inflow\nand metal transport are far more pronounced in discs. Metallicity gradients of\nboth morphological classes correlate with galaxy mass, with negative\nmetallicity gradients becoming steeper with increasing galaxy mass. The\ncorrelation with mass is stronger for late-type galaxies, with a slope of\n$d(\\nabla [Z/H])/d(\\log M)\\sim -0.2\\pm 0.05\\;$, compared to $d(\\nabla\n[Z/H])/d(\\log M)\\sim -0.05\\pm 0.05\\;$ for early-types. This result suggests\nthat the merger history plays a relatively small role in shaping metallicity\ngradients of galaxies.\n", "  Quantum dots inserted inside semiconductor nanowires are extremely promising\ncandidates as building blocks for solid-state based quantum computation and\ncommunication. They provide very high crystalline and optical properties and\noffer a convenient geometry for electrical contacting. Having a complete\ndetermination and full control of their emission properties is one of the key\ngoals of nanoscience researchers. Here we use strain as a tool to create in a\nsingle magnetic nanowire quantum dot a light-hole exciton, an optically active\nquasiparticle formed from a single electron bound to a single light hole. In\nthis frame, we provide a general description of the mixing within the hole\nquadruplet induced by strain or confinement. A multi-instrumental combination\nof cathodoluminescence, polarisation-resolved Fourier imaging and\nmagneto-optical spectroscopy, allow us to fully characterize the hole ground\nstate, including its valence band mixing with heavy hole states.\n", "  We report new observations from a systematic, spectroscopic, ultraviolet\nabsorption-line survey that maps the spatial and kinematic properties of the\nhigh-velocity gas in the Galactic Center region. We examine the hypothesis that\nthis gas traces the biconical nuclear outflow. We use ultraviolet spectra of 47\nbackground QSOs and halo stars projected inside and outside the northern Fermi\nBubble from the Hubble Space Telescope to study the incidence of high velocity\nabsorption around it. We use five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi\nBubble to constrain the velocity and column densities of outflowing gas traced\nby O I, Al II, C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, Si IV and other species. All five\nlines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high\nvelocity absorption components, whereas only 9 out of the 42 lines of sight\noutside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption\ncomponents. The observed outflow velocity profile decreases with Galactic\nlatitude and radial distance (R) from the Galactic Center. The observed\nblueshifted velocities change from $v_{GSR}$=-265 km/s at R~2.3 kpc to\n$v_{GSR}$=-91 km/s at R~6.5 kpc. We derive the metallicity of the entrained gas\nalong the 1H1613-097 sightline, which passes through the center of the northern\nFermi Bubble, finding [O/H] $\\gtrsim -0.54 \\pm 0.15$. A simple kinematic model\ntuned to match the observed absorption component velocities along the five\nlines of sight inside the Bubble, constrains the outflow velocities to\n~1000$-$1300 km/s, and the age of the outflow to be ~ 6$-$9 Myr. We estimate a\nminimum mass outflow rate for the nuclear outflow to be $\\gtrsim$ 0.2 $\\rm{\nM_{\\odot}\\; yr^{-1}}$. Combining the age and mass outflow rates, we determine a\nminimum mass of total UV absorbing cool gas entrained in the Fermi Bubbles to\nbe $\\gtrsim \\rm{ 2 \\times 10^{6} M_{\\odot}}$.\n", "  Dust formation and resulting mass loss around Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nstars with initial metallicity in the range of $0 \\leq Z_{\\rm ini} \\leq\n10^{-4}$ and initial mass $2\\leq M_{\\rm ini}/M_{\\odot} \\leq 5$ are explored by\nthe hydrodynamical calculations of dust-driven wind (DDW) along the AGB\nevolutionary tracks. We employ the MESA code to simulate the evolution of\nstars, assuming an empirical mass-loss rate in the post-main sequence phase,\nand considering the three types of low-temperature opacities (scaled-solar,\nCO-enhanced, and CNO-enhanced opacities) to elucidate the effect on the stellar\nevolution and the DDW. We find that the treatment of low-temperature opacity\nstrongly affects the dust formation and resulting DDW; in the carbon-rich AGB\nphase, the maximum $\\dot{M}$ of $M_{\\rm ini} \\geq$ 3 $M_{\\odot}$ star with the\nCO-enhanced opacity is at least one order of magnitude smaller than that with\nthe CNO-enhanced opacity. A wide range of stellar parameters being covered, a\nnecessary condition for driving efficient DDW with $\\dot{M} \\ge 10^{-6}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is expressed as the effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}\n\\lesssim 3850$ K and $\\log(\\delta_{\\rm C}L/\\kappa_{\\rm R} M) \\gtrsim 10.43\\log\nT_{\\rm eff}-32.33 $ with the carbon excess $\\delta_{\\rm C}$ defined as\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm C} - \\epsilon_{\\rm O}$ and the Rosseland mean opacity\n$\\kappa_{\\rm R}$ in units of cm$^2$g$^{-1}$ in the surface layer, and the\nstellar mass (luminosity) $M$ $(L)$ in solar units. The derived fitting\nformulae of gas and dust mass-loss rates in terms of input stellar parameters\ncould be useful for investigating the dust yield from AGB stars in the early\nUniverse being consistent with the stellar evolution calculations.\n", "  More than 90% of the known Milky Way supernova remnants are within 5 degrees\nof the Galactic Plane. We present the discovery of the supernova remnant\nG181.1+9.5, a new high-latitude SNR, serendipitously discovered in an ongoing\nsurvey of the Galactic Anti-centre High-Velocity Cloud complex, observed with\nthe DRAO Synthesis Telescope in the 21~cm radio continuum and HI spectral line.\nWe use radio continuum observations (including the linearly polarized\ncomponent) at 1420~MHz (observed with the DRAO ST) and 4850~MHz (observed with\nthe Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope) to map G181.1+9.5 and determine its\nnature as a SNR. High-resolution 21~cm HI line observations and HI emission and\nabsorption spectra reveal the physical characteristics of its local\ninterstellar environment. Finally, we estimate the basic physical parameters of\nG181.1+9.5 using models for highly-evolved SNRs. G181.1+9.5 has a circular\nshell-like morphology with a radius of about 16~pc at a distance of 1.5 kpc\nsome 250 pc above the mid-plane. The radio observations reveal highly linearly\npolarized emission with a non-thermal spectrum. Archival ROSAT X-ray data\nreveal high-energy emission from the interior of G181.1+9.5 indicative of the\npresence of shock-heated ejecta. The SNR is in the advanced radiative phase of\nSNR evolution, expanding into the HVC inter-cloud medium with a density of\n1$~cm$^{-3}$. Basic physical attributes of G181.1+9.5 calculated with radiative\nSNR models show an upper-limit age of 16,000 years, a swept-up mass of more\nthan 300 solar masses, and an ambient density in agreement with that estimated\nfrom HI observations. G181.1+9.5 shows all characteristics of a typical mature\nshell-type SNR, but its observed faintness is unusual and requires further\nstudy.\n", "  Many of the observed spin--orbit alignment properties of exoplanets can be\nexplained in the context of the primordial disk misalignment model, in which an\ninitially aligned protoplanetary disk is torqued by a distant stellar companion\non a misaligned orbit, resulting in a precessional motion that can lead to\nlarge-amplitude oscillations of the spin--orbit angle. We consider a variant of\nthis model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a\nfew au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the\ndynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer\nparts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,\nrigid disks. We show that the planet misaligns the inner disk even as the\norientation of the outer disk remains unchanged. In addition to the\noscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the\nsmaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also\nexhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from\nthe disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum\ndrops below that of the planet. Altogether, these two effects can produce\nsignificant misalignment angles for the inner disk, including retrograde\nconfigurations. We discuss these results within the framework of the Stranded\nHot Jupiter scenario and consider their implications, including to the\ninterpretation of the alignment properties of debris disks.\n", "  A simple model of a periodic ensemble of closely packed flux tubes sitting\natop a vertically stratified layer reveals that an incident fast wave from\nbelow preferentially converts almost immediately to Alfv\\'en waves in the flux\ntubes, with kink waves restricted to at most a very few Fourier modes. This\nsuggests that observations of coronal kink modes in such structured systems may\ngreatly underestimate the net wave energy flux being transported into and\nthrough the corona, much of which may reside in harder-to-observe Alfv\\'en\nwaves. The processes of mode conversion/resonant absorption and Alfv\\'en phase\nmixing are implicated. It is suggested that the Sun's internal p-mode field --\nthe 5-minute oscillations -- may contribute substantially to the process by\nsupplying incident fast waves in the chromosphere that scatter and mode-convert\nin the tube ensemble.\n", "  We present ground-based observations from the Discovery Channel Telescope\n(DCT) of three transits of Kepler-445c---a supposed super-Earth exoplanet with\nproperties resembling GJ 1214b---and demonstrate that the transit depth is\napproximately 50 percent shallower than the depth previously inferred from\nKepler Spacecraft data. The resulting decrease in planetary radius\nsignificantly alters the interpretation of the exoplanet's bulk composition.\nDespite the faintness of the M4 dwarf host star, our ground-based photometry\nclearly recovers each transit and achieves repeatable 1-sigma precision of\napproximately 0.2 percent (2 millimags). The transit parameters estimated from\nthe DCT data are discrepant with those inferred from the Kepler data to at\nleast 17-sigma confidence. This inconsistency is due to a subtle miscalculation\nof the stellar crowding metric during the Kepler pre-search data conditioning\n(PDC). The crowding metric, or CROWDSAP, is contaminated by a non-existent\n\"phantom star\" originating in the USNO-B1 catalog and inherited by the Kepler\nInput Catalog (KIC). Phantom stars in the KIC are likely rare, but they have\nthe potential to affect statistical studies of Kepler targets that use the PDC\ntransit depths for a large number of exoplanets where individual follow-up\nobservation of each is not possible. The miscalculation of Kepler-445c's\ntransit depth emphasizes the importance of stellar crowding in the Kepler data,\nand provides a cautionary tale for the analysis of data from the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which will have even larger pixels than\nKepler.\n", "  Yellow hypergiants are rare and represent a fast evolutionary stage of\nmassive evolved stars. That evolutionary phase is characterised by a very\nintense mass loss, the understanding of which is still very limited. Here we\nreport ALMA Compact Array observations of a 50$\"$-mosaic toward the Fried Egg\nnebula, around one of the few Galactic yellow hypergiants IRAS 17163-3907. The\nemission from the $^{12}$CO J=2-1 line, H30$\\alpha$ recombination line, and\ncontinuum is imaged at a resolution of $\\sim$8$\"$, revealing the morphology of\nthe molecular environment around the star. The continuum emission is unresolved\nand peaks at the position of the star. The radio recombination line H30$\\alpha$\nshows unresolved emission at the star, with an approximately gaussian spectrum\ncentered on a velocity of 21$\\pm$3~km/s with a width of 57$\\pm$6~km/s. In\ncontrast, the CO 2-1 emission is complex and decomposes into several components\nbeyond the contamination from interstellar gas in the line of sight. The CO\nspectrum toward the star is a broad plateau, centered at the systemic velocity\nof +18 km/s and with an expansion velocity of 100$\\pm$10 km/s. Assuming\nisotropic and constant mass-loss, we estimate a mass-loss rate of 8$\\pm$1.5\n$\\times10^{-5}$~M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At a radius of 25$\"$ from the star, we\ndetect CO emission associated with the dust ring previously imaged by {\\it\nHerschel}. The kinematics of this ring, however, is not consistent with an\nexpanding shell, but show a velocity gradient of $v_{sys} \\pm$20 km/s. In\naddition, we find a puzzling bright feature radially connecting the star to the\nCO ring, at a velocity of +40 km/s relative to the star. This spur feature may\ntrace a unidirectional ejection event from the star. Our ACA observations\nreveal the complex morphology around IRAS 17163 and illustrate the\nbreakthroughs that ALMA will bring to the field of massive stellar evolution.\n", "  Pulse arrival time measurements over fourteen years with the Nanshan 25-m and\nParkes 64-m radio telescopes have been used to determine the average profile\nand timing properties for PSR J1757$-$2421 (B1754$-$24). Analysis of the radio\nprofile data shows a large variation of spectral index across the profile and\nan unusual increase in component separation with increasing frequency. The\ntiming observations show that PSR B1754$-$24 underwent a large glitch with a\nfractional increase in spin frequency of $\\Delta\\nu_{\\rm g}/\\nu\\sim\n7.8\\times10^{-6}$ in May 2011. At the time of the glitch there was a large\npermanent jump in the rotational frequency accompanied by two exponential\nrecovery terms with timescales of 15(6) and 97(15) days, respectively.\n", "  We present spectral line mapping observations toward four massive\nstar-forming regions (Cepheus A, DR21S, S76E and G34.26+0.15), with the IRAM 30\nmeter telescope at 2 mm and 3 mm bands. Totally 396 spectral lines from 51\nmolecules, one helium recombination line, ten hydrogen recombination lines, and\n16 unidentified lines were detected in these four sources. An emission line of\nnitrosyl cyanide (ONCN, 14$_{0,14}$-13$_{0,13}$) was detected in G34.26+0.15,\nas first detection in massive star-forming regions. We found that the\n$c$-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ and NH$_{2}$D show enhancement in shocked regions as\nsuggested by evidences of SiO and/or SO emission. Column density and rotational\ntemperature of CH$_{3}$CN were estimated with the rotational diagram method for\nall four sources. Isotope abundance ratios of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C were derived\nusing HC$_{3}$N and its $^{13}$C isotopologue, which were around 40 in all four\nmassive star-forming regions and slightly lower than the local interstellar\nvalue ($\\sim$65). $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O abundance ratios in\nthese sources were also derived using double isotopic method, which were\nslightly lower than that in local interstellar medium. Except for Cep A,\n$^{33}$S/$^{34}$S ratio in the other three targets were derived, which were\nsimilar to that in the local interstellar medium. The column density ratios of\nN(DCN)/N(HCN) and N(DCO$^{+}$)/N(HCO$^{+}$) in these sources were more than two\norders of magnitude higher than the elemental [D]/[H] ratio, which is\n1.5$\\times$10$ ^{-5}$. Our results show the later stage sources, G34.26+0.15 in\nparticular, present more molecular species than earlier stage ones. Evidence of\nshock activity is seen in all stages studied.\n", "  To better constrain the hypotheses proposed to explain why only a few quasars\nare radio loud (RL), we compare the characteristics of 1958 nearby $(z\\le 0.3)$\nSDSS quasars, covered by the FIRST and NVSS radio surveys. Only 22\\% are RL\nwith $\\log(L_{1.4{\\rm GHz}}) \\ge 22.5$ W Hz$^{-1}$, the majority being compact\n(C), weak radio sources (WRS), with $\\log(L_{1.4{\\rm GHz}}) < 24.5$ W\nHz$^{-1}$. 15\\% of the RL quasars have extended radio morphologies: 3\\% have a\ncore and a jet (J), 2\\% have a core with one lobe (L), and 10\\% have a core\nwith two lobes (T), the majority being powerful radio sources (PRS), with\n$\\log(L_{1.4{\\rm GHz}}) \\ge 24.5$ W Hz$^{-1}$. In general, RL quasars have\nhigher bolometric luminosities and ionisation powers than radio quiet (RQ)\nquasars. The WRS have comparable black hole (BH) masses as the RQ quasars, but\nhigher accretion rates or radiative efficiencies. The PRS have higher BH masses\nthan the WRS, but comparable accretion rates or radiative efficiencies. The WRS\nalso have higher $FWHM_{\\rm [OIII]}$ than the PRS, consistent with a coupling\nof the spectral characteristics of the quasars with their radio morphologies.\nInspecting the SDSS images and applying a neighbour search algorithm reveal no\ndifference between the RQ and RL quasars of their host galaxies, environments,\nand interaction. Our results prompt the conjecture that the phenomenon that\nsparks the radio-loud phase in quasars is transient, intrinsic to the AGN, and\nstochastic, due to the chaotic nature of the accretion process of matter onto\nthe BHs.\n", "  We present low temperature magneto-photoluminescence experiments which\ndemonstrate the brightening of dark excitons by an in-plane magnetic field $B$\napplied to monolayers of different semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides. For both WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ monolayers, the dark exciton\nemission is observed at $\\sim$50 meV below the bright exciton peak and displays\na characteristic doublet structure which intensity is growing with $B^2$, while\nno magnetic field induced emission peaks appear for MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Our\nexperiments also show that the MoS$_2$ monolayer has a dark exciton ground\nstate with a dark-bright exciton splitting energy of $\\sim$100 meV.\n", "  The field of exoplanetary science has seen discovery rates increase\ndramatically over recent years, due largely to the data from the Kepler\nmission. Even so, individual discoveries of planets orbiting nearby stars are\nvery important for studies of characterization and near-term follow-up\nprospects. The recent discovery of a terrestrial planet candidate orbiting\nProxima Centauri presents numerous opportunities for studying a Super-Earth\nwithin our own stellar backyard. One of the remaining ambiguities of the\ndiscovery is the true mass of the planet since the discovery signature was\nobtained via radial velocities. Here we describe the effect of orbital\ninclination on the Proxima Centauri planet, in terms of mass, radius,\natmosphere, and albedo. We calculate the astrometric, angular separation, and\nreflected light properties of the planet including the effects of orbital\neccentricity. We further provide dynamical simulations that show how the\npresence of additional terrestrial planets within the Habitable Zone varies as\na function of inclination. Finally, we discuss these effects in the context of\nfuture space-based photometry and imaging missions that could potentially\ndetect the planetary signature and resolve the inclination and mass ambiguity\nof the planet.\n", "  In this paper we describe a new approach for mm-VLBI calibration that\nprovides bona-fide astrometric alignment of the mm-wavelength images from a\nsingle source, for the measurement of frequency dependent effects, such as\n`core-shifts' near the black hole of AGN jets. We achieve our astrometric\nalignment by solving firstly for the ionospheric (dispersive) contributions\nusing wide-band cm-wavelength observations. Secondly we solve for the\ntropospheric (non-dispersive) contributions by using fast frequency-switching\nat the target mm-wavelengths. These solutions can be scaled and transferred\nfrom the low frequency to the high frequency. To complete the calibration chain\none additional step was required to remove a residual constant phase offset on\neach antenna. The result is an astrometric calibration and the measurement of\nthe core-shift between 22 and 43 GHz for the jet in BL Lacertae to be -8$\\pm$5,\n20$\\pm$6 $\\mu$as, in RA and Declination, respectively. By comparison to\nconventional phase referencing at cm-wavelengths we are able to show that this\ncore shift at mm-wavelengths is significantly less than what would be predicted\nby extrapolating the low frequency result, which closely followed the\npredictions of the Blandford \\& K\\\"onigl conical jet model. As such it would be\nthe first demonstration for the association of the VLBI core with a\nrecollimation shock, normally hidden at low frequencies due to the optical\ndepth, which could be responsible for the $\\gamma$-ray production in blazar\njets.\n", "  We extend a previous work by Reischke et al., 2016 by studying the effects of\ntidal shear on clustering dark energy models within the framework of the\nextended spherical collapse model and using the Zel'dovich approximation. As in\nprevious works on clustering dark energy, we assumed a vanishing effective\nsound speed describing the perturbations in dark energy models. To be\nself-consistent, our treatment is valid only on linear scales since we do not\nintend to introduce any heuristic models. This approach makes the linear\noverdensity $\\delta_{\\rm c}$ mass dependent and similarly to the case of smooth\ndark energy, its effects are predominant at small masses and redshifts. Tidal\nshear has effects of the order of percent or less, regardless of the model and\npreserves a well known feature of clustering dark energy: When dark energy\nperturbations are included, the models resemble better the $\\Lambda$CDM\nevolution of perturbations. We also showed that effects on the comoving number\ndensity of halos are small and qualitatively and quantitatively in agreement\nwith what previously found for smooth dark energy models.\n", "  Core-collapse stripped-envelope supernova (SN) explosions reflect the\ndiversity of physical parameters and evolutionary paths of their massive star\nprogenitors. We have observed the type Ic SN iPTF15dld (z = 0.047), reported by\nthe Palomar Transient Factory. Spectra were taken starting 20 rest-frame days\nafter maximum luminosity and are affected by a young stellar population\nbackground. Broad spectral absorption lines associated with the SN are detected\nover the continuum, similar to those measured for broad-lined, highly energetic\nSNe Ic. The light curve and maximum luminosity are instead more similar to\nthose of low luminosity, narrow-lined Ic SNe. This suggests a behavior whereby\ncertain highly-stripped-envelope SNe do not produce a large amount of Ni56, but\nthe explosion is sufficiently energetic that a large fraction of the ejecta is\naccelerated to higher-than-usual velocities. We estimate SN iPTF15dld had a\nmain sequence progenitor of 20-25 Msun, produced a Ni56 mass of ~0.1-0.2 Msun,\nhad an ejecta mass of [2-10] Msun, and a kinetic energy of [1-18] e51 erg.\n", "  The dynamic range of the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor (XMM-OM) is limited at\nthe bright end by coincidence loss, the superposition of multiple photons in\nthe individual frames recorded from its micro-channel-plate (MCP) intensified\ncharge-coupled device (CCD) detector. One way to overcome this limitation is to\nuse photons that arrive during the frame transfer of the CCD, forming vertical\nread-out streaks for bright sources. We calibrate these read-out streaks for\nphotometry of bright sources observed with XMM-OM. The bright source limit for\nread-out streak photometry is set by the recharge time of the MCPs. For XMM-OM\nwe find that the MCP recharge time is 0.55 ms. We determine that the effective\nbright limits for read-out streak photometry with XMM-OM are approximately 1.5\nmagnitudes brighter than the bright source limits for normal aperture\nphotometry in full-frame images. This translates into bright-source limits in\nVega magnitudes of UVW2=7.1, UVM2=8.0, UVW1=9.4, U=10.5, B=11.5, V=10.2 and\nWhite=12.5 for data taken early in the mission. The limits brighten by up to\n0.2 magnitudes, depending on filter, over the course of the mission as the\ndetector ages. The method is demonstrated by deriving UVW1 photometry for the\nsymbiotic nova RR Telescopii, and the new photometry is used to constrain the\ne-folding time of its decaying UV emission. Using the read-out streak method,\nwe obtain photometry for 50 per cent of the missing UV source measurements in\nversion 2.1 of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous UV Source Survey (XMM-SUSS 2.1)\ncatalogue.\n", "  This paper reports the discovery of evidence for physical contact between the\nGalactic circumnuclear disk (CND) and an exterior giant molecular cloud. The\ncentral 10 pc of our Galaxy has been imaged in the HCN J=1-0, HCO+ J=1-0, CS\nJ=2-1, H13CN J=1-0, SiO J=2-1, SO N_J=2_3-1_2, and HC3N J=11-10 lines using the\nNobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m radio telescope. Based on our examination of\nthe position-velocity maps of several high-density probe lines, we have found\nthat an emission \"bridge\" may be connecting the +20 km/s cloud (M-0.13-0.08)\nand the negative-longitude extension of the CND. Analyses of line intensity\nratios imply that the chemical property of the bridge is located between the\n+20 km/s cloud and the CND. We introduce a new interpretation that a part of\nthe CND may be colliding with the 20 km/s cloud and the collision may be\nresponsible for the formation of the bridge. Such collisional events could\npromote mass accretion onto the CND or into the inner ionized cavity, which may\nbe further tested by proper motion studies.\n", "  We report on the spectral and timing properties of the accreting millisecond\nX-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 observed by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR during its 2015\noutburst. The source is in a hard state dominated at high energies by a\ncomptonization of soft photons ($\\sim0.9$ keV) by an electron population with\nkT$_e\\sim30$ keV, and at lower energies by a blackbody component with\nkT$\\sim0.5$ keV. A moderately broad, neutral Fe emission line and four narrow\nabsorption lines are also found. By investigating the pulse phase evolution, we\nderived the best-fitting orbital solution for the 2015 outburst. Comparing the\nupdated ephemeris with those of the previous outbursts, we set a $3\\sigma$\nconfidence level interval $-6.6\\times 10^{-13}$ s/s $< \\dot{P}_{orb} < 6.5\n\\times 10^{-13}$ s/s on the orbital period derivative. Moreover, we\ninvestigated the pulse profile dependence on energy finding a peculiar\nbehaviour of the pulse fractional amplitude and lags as a function of energy.\nWe performed a phase-resolved spectroscopy showing that the blackbody component\ntracks remarkably well the pulse-profile, indicating that this component\nresides at the neutron star surface (hot-spot).\n", "  We report the results of spectroscopic observations and numerical modelling\nof the H II region IRAS 18153-1651. Our study was motivated by the discovery of\nan optical arc and two main-sequence stars of spectral type B1 and B3 near the\ncentre of IRAS 18153-1651. We interpret the arc as the edge of the wind bubble\n(blown by the B1 star), whose brightness is enhanced by the interaction with a\nphotoevaporation flow from a nearby molecular cloud. This interpretation\nimplies that we deal with a unique case of a young massive star (the most\nmassive member of a recently formed low-mass star cluster) caught just tens of\nthousands of years after its stellar wind has begun to blow a bubble into the\nsurrounding dense medium. Our two-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulations of the wind bubble and the H II region around the B1 star provide a\nreasonable match to observations, both in terms of morphology and absolute\nbrightness of the optical and mid-infrared emission, and verify the young age\nof IRAS 18153-1651. Taken together our results strongly suggest that we have\nrevealed the first example of a wind bubble blown by a main-sequence B star.\n", "  The unification theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) hypothesizes that all\nAGNs are surrounded by an anisotropic dust torus and are essentially the same\nobjects but viewed from different angles. However, little is known about the\ndust which plays a central role in the unification theory. There are\nsuggestions that the AGN dust extinction law appreciably differs from that of\nthe Galaxy. Also, the silicate emission features observed in type 1 AGNs appear\nanomalous (i.e., their peak wavelengths and widths differ considerably from\nthat of the Galaxy). In this work, we explore the dust properties of 147 AGNs\nof various types at redshifts z<0.5, with special attention paid to 93 AGNs\nwhich exhibit the 9.7 and 18 $\\mu$m silicate emission features. We model their\nsilicate emission spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph aboard the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. We find that 60/93 of the observed spectra can be well\nexplained with \"astronomical silicate\", while the remaining sources favor\namorphous olivine or pyroxene. Most notably, all sources require the dust to be\n$\\mu$m-sized (with a typical size of ~1.5$\\pm$0.1 $\\mu$m), much larger than\nsub-$\\mu$m-sized Galactic interstellar grains, implying a flat or \"gray\"\nextinction law for AGNs. We also find that, while the 9.7 $\\mu$m emission\nfeature arises predominantly from warm silicate dust of temperature T~270 K,\nthe ~5--8 $\\mu$m continuum emission is mostly from carbon dust of T~640 K.\nFinally, the correlations between the dust properties (e.g., mass, temperature)\nand the AGN properties (e.g., luminosity, black hole mass) have also been\ninvestigated.\n", "  We present ALMA [CI]($1-0$) (rest frequency 492 GHz) observations for a\nsample of 13 strongly-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies originally discovered\nat 1.4mm in a blank-field survey by the South Pole Telescope. We compare these\nnew data with available [CI] observations from the literature, allowing a study\nof the ISM properties of $\\sim 30$ extreme dusty star-forming galaxies spanning\na redshift range $2 < z < 5$. Using the [CI] line as a tracer of the molecular\nISM, we find a mean molecular gas mass for SPT-DSFGs of $6.6 \\times 10^{10}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. This is in tension with gas masses derived via low-$J$ $^{12}$CO\nand dust masses; bringing the estimates into accordance requires either (a) an\nelevated CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor for our sample of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO} \\sim\n2.5$ and a gas-to-dust ratio $\\sim200$, or (b) an high carbon abundance $X_{\\rm\nCI} \\sim 7\\times10^{-5}$. Using observations of a range of additional atomic\nand molecular lines (including [CI], [CII], and multiple transitions of CO), we\nuse a modern Photodissociation Region code (3D-PDR) to assess the physical\nconditions (including the density, UV radiation field strength, and gas\ntemperature) within the ISM of the DSFGs in our sample. We find that the ISM\nwithin our DSFGs is characterised by dense gas permeated by strong UV fields.\nWe note that previous efforts to characterise PDR regions in DSFGs may have\nsignificantly underestimated the density of the ISM. Combined, our analysis\nsuggests that the ISM of extreme dusty starbursts at high redshift consists of\ndense, carbon-rich gas not directly comparable to the ISM of starbursts in the\nlocal Universe.\n", "  We report on simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of the\nradio-mode-switching pulsar PSR B1822-09 with ESA's XMM-Newton and the WSRT,\nGMRT and Lovell radio telescopes. PSR B1822-09 switches between a radio-bright\nand radio-quiet mode, and we discovered a relationship between the durations of\nits modes and a known underlying radio-modulation timescale within the modes.\nWe discovered X-ray (energies 0.2-1.4 keV) pulsations with a broad sinusoidal\npulse, slightly lagging the radio main pulse in phase by 0.094 +/- 0.017, with\nan energy-dependent pulsed fraction varying from ~0.15 at 0.3 keV to ~0.6 at 1\nkeV. No evidence is found for simultaneous X-ray and radio mode switching. The\ntotal X-ray spectrum consists of a cool component (T ~ 0.96 x 10^6 K, hot-spot\nradius R ~ 2.0 km) and a hot component (T ~ 2.2 x 10^6 K, R ~ 100 m). The hot\ncomponent can be ascribed to the pulsed emission and the cool component to the\nunpulsed emission. The high-energy characteristics of PSR B1822-09 resemble\nthose of middle-aged pulsars such as PSR B0656+14, PSR B1055-52 and Geminga,\nincluding an indication for pulsed high-energy gamma-ray emission in Fermi LAT\ndata. Explanations for the high pulsed fraction seem to require different\ntemperatures at the two poles of this orthogonal rotator, or magnetic\nanisotropic beaming effects in its strong magnetic field. In the X-ray skymap\nwe found a harder source at only (5.1+/- 0.5 )arcsec from PSR B1822-09, which\nmight be a pulsar wind nebula.\n", "  Investigation of period-color (PC) and amplitude-color (AC) relations at the\nmaximum and minimum light can be used to probe the interaction of the hydrogen\nionization front (HIF) with photosphere and the radiation hydrodynamics of the\nouter envelopes of Cepheids and RR Lyraes. For example, theoretical\ncalculations indicated that such interactions would occur at minimum light for\nRR Lyrae and result in a flatter PC relation. In the past, the PC and AC\nrelations have been investigated by using either the $(V-R)_{MACHO}$ or $(V-I)$\ncolors. In this work, we extend previous work to other bands by analyzing the\nRR Lyraes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 Region. Multi-epoch data is\navailable for RR Lyraes located within the footprint of the Stripe 82 Region in\nfive ($ugriz$) bands. We present the PC and AC relations at maximum and minimum\nlight in four colors: $(u-g)_0$, $(g-r)_0$, $(r-i)_0$ and $(i-z)_0$, after they\nare corrected for extinction. We found that the PC and AC relations for this\nsample of RR Lyraes show a complex nature in the form of flat, linear or\nquadratic relations. Furthermore, the PC relations at minimum light for\nfundamental mode RR Lyrae stars are separated according to the Oosterhoff type,\nespecially in the $(g-r)_0$ and $(r-i)_0$ colors. If only considering the\nresults from linear regressions, our results are quantitatively consistent with\nthe theory of HIF-photosphere interaction for both fundamental and first\novertone RR Lyraes.\n", "  We obtained optical spectroscopy of close (< 80 kpc) companion objects of a\nsample of 12 low redshift quasars (z < 0.3 ) selected from the SDSS Stripe82\narea and that are in the subsample of 52 QSOs for which both multicolor host\ngalaxies properties and galaxy environment was recently investigated in detail.\nWe found that for 8 out of 12 sources the companion galaxy is associated to the\nQSO having a difference of radial velocity that is less than 400 km/s. Many of\nthese associated companions exhibit [OII] $\\lambda$3727 \\AA~ emission lines\nsuggestive of episodes of (recent) star formation possibly induced by past\ninteractions. The SFR of the companion galaxies as derived from [OII] line\nluminosity is, however, modest, with a median value of 1.0 +-0.8 M_sun/yr, and\nthe emission lines are barely consistent with expectation from gas ionization\nby the QSO. The role of the QSO for inducing star formation in close companion\ngalaxies appears meager. For three objects we also detect the starlight\nspectrum of the QSO host galaxy which is characterized by absorption lines of\nold stellar population and [OII] emission line.\n", "  In an earlier study we reported nearly 100 previously unknown dusty debris\ndisks around Hipparcos main sequence stars within 75 pc by selecting stars with\nexcesses in individual WISE colors. Here, we further scrutinize the Hipparcos\n75 pc sample to (1) gain sensitivity to previously undetected, fainter mid-IR\nexcesses and (2) to remove spurious excesses contaminated by previously\nunidentified blended sources. We improve upon our previous method by adopting a\nmore accurate measure of the confidence threshold for excess detection, and by\nadding an optimally-weighted color average that incorporates all\nshorter-wavelength WISE photometry, rather than using only individual WISE\ncolors. The latter is equivalent to spectral energy distribution fitting, but\nonly over WISE band passes. In addition, we leverage the higher resolution WISE\nimages available through the unWISE.me image service to identify contaminated\nWISE excesses based on photocenter offsets among the W3- and W4-band images.\nAltogether, we identify 19 previously unreported candidate debris disks.\nCombined with the results from our earlier study, we have found a total of 107\nnew debris disks around 75 pc Hipparcos main sequence stars using precisely\ncalibrated WISE photometry. This expands the 75 pc debris disk sample by 22%\naround Hipparcos main-sequence stars and by 20% overall (including non-main\nsequence and non-Hipparcos stars).\n", "  We report precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of WASP-47, a G star that\nhosts three transiting planets in close proximity (a hot Jupiter, a super-Earth\nand a Neptune-sized planet) and a non-transiting planet at 1.4 AU. Through a\njoint analysis of previously published RVs and our own Keck-HIRES RVs, we\nsignificantly improve the planet mass and bulk density measurements. For the\nsuper-Earth WASP-47e ($P$ = 0.79 days), we measure a mass of 9.11 $\\pm$ 1.17\n$M_\\oplus$, and a bulk density of 7.63 $\\pm$ 1.90 g cm$^{-3}$, consistent with\na rocky composition. For the hot Jupiter WASP-47b ($P$ = 4.2 days), we measure\na mass of 356 $\\pm$ 12 $M_\\oplus$ (1.12 $\\pm$ 0.04 $M_\\rm{Jup}$) and constrain\nits eccentricity to $<0.021$ at 3-$\\sigma$ confidence. For the Neptune-size\nplanet WASP-47d ($P$ = 9.0 days), we measure a mass of 12.75 $\\pm$ 2.70\n$M_\\oplus$, and a bulk density of 1.36 $\\pm$ 0.42 g cm$^{-3}$, suggesting it\nhas a thick H/He envelope. For the outer non-transiting planet, we measure a\nminimum mass of 411 $\\pm$ 18 $M_\\oplus$ (1.29 $\\pm$ 0.06 $M_\\rm{Jup}$), an\norbital period of 595.7 $\\pm$ 5.0 days, and an orbital eccentricity of 0.27\n$\\pm$ 0.04. Our new measurements are consistent with but 2$-$4$\\times$ more\nprecise than previous mass measurements.\n", "  We extend profile domain pulsar timing to incorporate wide-band effects such\nas frequency-dependent profile evolution and broadband shape variation in the\npulse profile. We also incorporate models for temporal variations in both pulse\nwidth and in the separation in phase of the main pulse and interpulse. We\nperform the analysis with both nested sampling and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nmethods. In the latter case we introduce a new parameterisation of the\nposterior that is extremely efficient in the low signal-to-noise regime and can\nbe readily applied to a wide range of scientific problems. We apply this\nmethodology to a series of simulations, and to between seven and nine yr of\nobservations for PSRs J1713$+$0747, J1744$-$1134, and J1909$-$3744 with\nfrequency coverage that spans 700-3600MHz. We use a smooth model for profile\nevolution across the full frequency range, and compare smooth and piecewise\nmodels for the temporal variations in DM. We find the profile domain framework\nconsistently results in improved timing precision compared to the standard\nanalysis paradigm by as much as 40% for timing parameters. Incorporating\nsmoothness in the DM variations into the model further improves timing\nprecision by as much as 30%. For PSR J1713+0747 we also detect pulse shape\nvariation uncorrelated between epochs, which we attribute to variation\nintrinsic to the pulsar at a level consistent with previously published\nanalyses. Not accounting for this shape variation biases the measured arrival\ntimes at the level of $\\sim$30ns, the same order of magnitude as the expected\nshift due to gravitational-waves in the pulsar timing band.\n", "  For the first time, we present the size evolution of a mass-complete\n(log(M*/Msol)>10) sample of star-forming galaxies over redshifts z=1-7,\nselected from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE). Observed H-band\nsizes are measured from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic\nLegacy Survey (CANDELS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/F160W imaging.\nDistributions of individual galaxy masses and sizes illustrate that a clear\nmass-size relation exists up to z~7. At z~7, we find that the average galaxy\nsize from the mass-size relation is more compact at a fixed mass of\nlog(M*/Msol)=10.1, with r_1/2,maj=1.02+/-0.29 kpc, than at lower redshifts.\nThis is consistent with our results from stacking the same CANDELS HST/F160W\nimaging, when we correct for galaxy position angle alignment. We find that the\nsize evolution of star-forming galaxies is well fit by a power law of the form\nr_e = 7.07(1 + z)^-0.89 kpc, which is consistent with previous works for normal\nstar-formers at 1<z<4. In order to compare our slope with those derived Lyman\nbreak galaxy studies, we correct for different IMFs and methodology and find a\nslope of -0.97+/-0.02, which is shallower than that reported for the evolution\nof Lyman break galaxies at z>4 (r_e\\propto(1 +z)^-1.2+/-0.06). Therefore, we\nconclude the Lyman break galaxies likely represent a subset of highly\nstar-forming galaxies that exhibit rapid size growth at z>4.\n", "  A systematic study is performed on radio properties of H$_{2}$O megamaser\nhost Seyfert 2 galaxies, through multi-band radio continuum observations (at\n11cm, 6.0 cm, 3.6 cm, 2.0 cm and 1.3 cm) with the Effelsberg 100-m radio\ntelescope within a total time duration of four days. For comparison, a control\nSeyfert 2 galaxy sample without detected maser emission was also observed.\nSpectral indices were determined for those sources for which measurements exist\nat two adjacent bands assuming a power-law dependence S$_\\nu \\propto\n\\nu^{-\\alpha}$, where S is the flux density and $\\nu$ is the frequency.\nComparisons of the radio continuum properties between megamaser and non-masing\nSeyfert 2s show no difference in spectral indices. However, a difference in\nradio luminosity is statistically significant, i.e. the maser galaxies tend to\nhave higher radio luminosities by a factor of 2 to 3 than the non-masing ones,\ncommonly reaching values above a critical threshold of 10$^{29}$\nergs$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$. This result confirms an earlier conclusion by Zhang et\nal. (2012), but is based on superior data with respect to the time interval\nwithin which the data were obtained, with respect to the observational facility\n(only one telescope used), the number of frequency bands.\n", "  Ongoing and future spectroscopic surveys will measure numerous galaxy\nredshifts within tens of thousands of galaxy clusters. However, the sampling\nwithin these clusters will be low, 15 < N < 50 per cluster. With such data, it\nwill be difficult to achieve accurate and precise mass estimates for individual\nclusters using phase-space mass estimation techniques. We develop and test a\nnew stacking algorithm based on the caustic technique, which reduces the mass\nscatter in <log M_caustic | M_200 > for ensemble clusters from 70% for\nindividual clusters to less than 10% for ensemble clusters with only 15\ngalaxies per cluster and 100 clusters per ensemble. With > 1000 galaxies per\nensemble phase-space, the escape-velocity edge becomes readily identifiable and\nthe presence of interloping galaxies is minimized. We develop and test an\nalgorithm to trace the projected phase-space surface directly, which results in\nminimally biased dynamical mass estimates. We then quantify how binning and\nsampling affect the phase-space-based mass estimates when using an\nobservational proxy that incorporates realistic mass scatter, like richness,\nand find the added uncertainty in the binning procedure has minimal influence\non the resulting bias and scatter of the stacked mass estimates.\n", "  We present multi-epoch astrometric observations of the M9 ultra-cool dwarf\nTVLM513-46546 that is placed at the brown dwarf boundary. The new observations\nhave been performed with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 6cm band. The\ntarget has been detected at 7~epochs spanning three years, with measured\nquiescent emission flux in the range 180-300 muJy. We identified four\nshort-duration flaring events (0.5-2 mJy) with very high circular polarization\n(~75%-100%). Properties of the observed radio flares support the physical model\nof the source that is characterized by the electron cyclotron maser instability\nresponsible for outbursts of radio emission. Combined with Very Long Baseline\nArray (VLBA) earlier data, our detections make it possible to refine the\nabsolute parallax pi=93.27(+0.18,-0.17) mas. Our measurements rule out\nTVLM513-46546 companions more massive than Jupiter in orbits with periods\nlonger than ~1 yr.\n", "  Recently reported variations in the typical physical properties of Galactic\nand extra-Galactic molecular clouds (MCs), and in their ability to form stars\nhave been attributed to local variations in the magnitude of interstellar\npressure. Inferences from these surveys have called into question two\nlong-standing beliefs that the MCs : 1 are Virialised entities and (2) have\napproximately constant surface density i.e., the validity of the Larson's third\nlaw. In this work we invoke the framework of cloud-formation via collisions\nbetween warm gas flows. Post-collision clouds forming in these realisations\ncool rapidly and evolve primarily via the interplay between the Non-linear Thin\nShell Instability (NTSI), and the self-gravity. Over the course of these\nsimulations we traced the temporal evolution of the surface density of the\nassembled clouds, the fraction of dense gas, the distribution of gas column\ndensity (NPDF), and the Virial nature of the assembled clouds. We conclude,\nthese physical properties of MCs not only exhibit temporal variation, but their\nrespective peak-magnitude also increases in proportion with the magnitude of\nexternal pressure, $P_{ext}$. The velocity dispersion in assembled clouds\nappears to follow the power-law, $\\sigma_{gas}\\propto P_{ext}^{0.23}$. Also,\nthe power-law tail at higher densities becomes shallower with increasing\nmagnitude of external pressure, for magnitudes, $P_{ext}/k_{B}\\lesssim 10^{7}$\nK cm$^{-3}$, at higher magnitudes such as those typically found in the Galactic\nCMZ ($P_{ext}/k_{B} > 10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$), the power-law shows significant\nsteepening. Thus while our results are broadly consistent with inferences from\nvarious recent observational surveys, it appears, MCs hardly exhibit a unique\nset of properties, but rather a wide variety, that can be reconciled with a\nrange of magnitudes of pressure between 10$^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$ - 10$^{8}$ K\ncm$^{-3}$.\n", "  We present the chemical abundance analysis of 19 upper main-sequence stars of\nthe young open cluster NGC 6250 (log t ~ 7.42 yr). This work is part of a\nproject aimed at setting observational constraints on the theory of atomic\ndiffusion in stellar photospheres, by means of a systematic study of the\nabundances of the chemical elements of early F-, A- and late B-type stars of\nwell-determined age. Our data set consists of low-, medium- and high-resolution\nspectra obtained with the Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES)\ninstrument of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT). To perform our analysis, we\nhave developed a new suite of software tools for the chemical abundance\nanalysis of stellar photospheres in local thermodynamical equilibrium. Together\nwith the chemical composition of the stellar photospheres, we have provided new\nestimates of the cluster mean radial velocity, proper motion, refined the\ncluster membership, and we have given the stellar parameters including masses\nand fractional age. We find no evidence of statistically significant\ncorrelation between any of the parameters, including abundance and cluster age,\nexcept perhaps for an increase in Ba abundance with cluster age. We have proven\nthat our new software tool may be successfully used for the chemical abundance\nanalysis of large data sets of stellar spectra.\n", "  The analysis of the BRITE oscillation spectrum of the main sequence early\nB-type star $\\nu$ Eridani is presented. Only models with the modified mean\nopacity profile can account for the observed frequency ranges as well as for\nthe values of some individual frequencies. The number of the $\\kappa$ modified\nseismic models is constrained by the nonadiabatic parameter $f$, which is very\nsensitive to the opacity changes in the subphotospheric layers where the\npulsations are driven. We present an example of the model that satisfies all\nthe above conditions. It seems that the OPLIB opacities are preferred over\nthose from the OPAL and OP projects. Moreover, we discuss additional\nconsequences of the opacity modification, namely, an enhancement of the\nefficiency of convection in the Z-bump as well as an occurrence of close radial\nmodes which is a kind of avoided-crossing phenomenon common for nonradial modes\nin standard main sequence models.\n", "  We discuss a number of examples for recent connections between emergent\nphenomena in many-body systems in atomic and condensed matter physics, and\nconfinement and other non-perturbative effects in quantum chromodynamics.\n", "  We present a radio light curve of supernova (SN) 2014C taken with the\nArcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array at 15.7 GHz. Optical\nobservations presented by Milisavljevic et al. demonstrated that SN 2014C\nmetamorphosed from a stripped-envelope Type Ib SN into a strongly interacting\nType IIn SN within 1 year. The AMI light curve clearly shows two distinct radio\npeaks, the second being a factor of 4 times more luminous than the first peak.\nThis double bump morphology indicates two distinct phases of mass-loss from the\nprogenitor star with the transition between density regimes occurring at\n100-200 days. This reinforces the interpretation that SN 2014C exploded in a\nlow density region before encountering a dense Hydrogen-rich shell of\ncircumstellar material that was likely ejected by the progenitor prior to the\nexplosion. The AMI flux measurements of the first light curve bump are the only\nreported observations taken within ~50 to ~125 days post-explosion, before the\nblast-wave encountered the Hydrogen shell. Simplistic synchrotron\nself-absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) modelling suggest that\nsome physical properties of SN 2014C, such as the mass-loss rate, are\nconsistent with the properties of other Type Ibc and IIn SNe. However, our\nsingle frequency data does not allow us to distinguish between these two\nmodels, which implies they are likely too simplistic to describe the complex\nenvironment surrounding this event. Lastly, we present the precise radio\nlocation of SN 2014C obtained with eMERLIN, which will be useful for future\nVLBI observations of the SN.\n", "  We report the results of a new \\textit{XMM-Newton} observation of the\nhelium-rich hot subdwarf BD+37$^{\\circ}$442 carried out in February 2016. The\npossible periodicity at 19 s seen in a 2011 shorter observation is not\nconfirmed, thus dismissing the evidence for a binary nature. This implies that\nthe observed soft X-ray emission, with a luminosity of a few 10$^{31}$\nergs$^{-1}$, originates in BD+37$^{\\circ}$442 itself, rather than in an\naccreting neutron star companion. The X-ray spectrum is well fit by thermal\nplasma emission with a temperature of 0.22 keV and non-solar element\nabundances. Besides the overabundance of He, C and N already known from\noptical/UV studies, the X-ray spectra indicate also a significant excess of Ne.\nThe soft X-ray spectrum and the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity,\nL$_{\\rm X}$/L$_{\\rm BOL}\\sim2\\times10^{-7}$, are similar to those observed in\nmassive early-type stars. This indicates that the mechanisms responsible for\nplasma shock-heating can work also in the weak stellar winds (mass loss rates\n$\\dot M_{\\rm W} \\leq10^{-8}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of low-mass hot\nstars.\n", "  We present infrared spectroscopy of the classical nova V339 Delphini,\nobtained over a $\\sim2$ year period. The infrared emission lines were initially\nsymmetrical, with HWHM velocities of 525 km s$^{-1}$. In later\n($t\\gtrsim77$days, where $t$ is the time from outburst) spectra however, the\nlines displayed a distinct asymmetry, with a much stronger blue wing, possibly\ndue to obscuration of the receding component by dust. Dust formation commenced\nat $\\sim$ day 34.75 at a condensation temperature of $1480\\pm20$K, consistent\nwith graphitic carbon. Thereafter the dust temperature declined with time as\n$T_{\\rm d}\\propto{t}^{-0.346}$, also consistent with graphitic carbon. The mass\nof dust initally rose, as a result of an increase in grain size and/or number,\npeaked at $\\sim$ day 100, and then declined precipitously. This decline was\nmost likely caused by grain shattering due to electrostatic stress after the\ndust was exposed to X-radiation. An Appendix summarises Planck Means for\ncarbon, and the determination of grain mass and radius for a carbon dust shell.\n", "  We present phase-resolved spectroscopy of the millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE\nJ1814-338 obtained during its 2003 outburst. The spectra are dominated by\nhigh-excitation emission lines of HeII $\\lambda$4686, H$\\beta$, and the Bowen\nblend CIII/NIII 4630-50\\AA. We exploit the proven Bowen fluorescence technique\nto establish a complete set of dynamical system parameter constraints using\nbootstrap Doppler tomography, a first for an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar\nbinary. The reconstructed Doppler map of the NIII $\\lambda$4640 Bowen\ntransition exhibits a statistically significant (>4$\\sigma$) spot feature at\nthe expected position of the companion star. If this feature is driven by\nirradiation of the surface of the Roche lobe filling companion, we derive a\nstrict lower limit to the true radial velocity semi-amplitude $K_2$. Combining\nour donor constraint with the well constrained orbit of the neutron star leads\nto a determination of the binary mass ratio: q = $0.123^{+0.012}_{-0.010}$. The\ncomponent masses are not tightly constrained given our lack of knowledge of the\nbinary inclination. We cannot rule out a canonical neutron star mass of 1.4\n$M_{\\odot}$ (1.1 $M_{\\odot}$ < $M_1$ < 3.1 $M_{\\odot}$; 95%). The 68/95%\nconfidence limits of $M_2$ are consistent with the companion being a\nsignificantly bloated, M-type main sequence star. Our findings, combined with\nresults from studies of the quiescent optical counterpart of XTE J1814-338,\nsuggest the presence of a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar in XTE J1814-338\nduring an X-ray quiescent state. The companion mass is typical of the so-called\n'redback' pulsar binary systems ($M_2$ ~ 0.2 $M_{\\odot}$).\n", "  Space-based photometric measurements first revealed low-amplitude\nirregularities in the pulsations of Cepheid stars, but their origins and how\ncommonly they occur remain uncertain. To investigate this phenomenon, we\npresent MOST space telescope photometry of two Cepheids. V473 Lyrae is a\nsecond-overtone, strongly modulated Cepheid, while U Trianguli Australis is a\nCepheid pulsating simultaneously in the fundamental mode and first overtone.\nThe nearly continuous, high-precision photometry reveals alternations in the\namplitudes of cycles in V473 Lyr, the first case of period doubling detected in\na classical Cepheid. In U TrA, we tentatively identify one peak as the $f_X$ or\n0.61-type mode often seen in conjunction with the first radial overtone in\nCepheids, but given the short length of the data, we cannot rule out that it is\na combination peak instead.\n  Ground-based photometry and spectroscopy were obtained to follow two\nmodulation cycles in V473 Lyr and to better specify its physical parameters.\nThe simultaneous data yield the phase lag parameter (the phase difference\nbetween maxima in luminosity and radial velocity) of a second-overtone Cepheid\nfor the first time. We find no evidence for a period change in U TrA or an\nenergy exchange between the fundamental mode and the first overtone during the\nlast 50 years, contrary to earlier indications.\n  Period doubling in V473 Lyr provides a strong argument that mode interactions\ndo occur in some Cepheids and we may hypothesise that it could be behind the\namplitude modulation, as recently proposed for Blazhko RR Lyrae stars.\n", "  The abundance of elements synthesized by the rapid neutron-capture process\n(r-process elements) of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Local Group\ngalaxies gives us clues to clarify the early evolutionary history of the Milky\nWay halo. The Local Group dwarf galaxies would have similarly evolved with\nbuilding blocks of the Milky Way halo. However, how the chemo-dynamical\nevolution of the building blocks affects the abundance of r-process elements is\nnot yet clear. In this paper, we perform a series of simulations using dwarf\ngalaxy models with various dynamical times and total mass, which determine\nstar-formation histories. We find that galaxies with dynamical times longer\nthan 100 Myr have star formation rates less than $10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$\nand slowly enrich metals in their early phase. These galaxies can explain the\nobserved large scatters of r-process abundance in EMP stars in the Milky Way\nhalo regardless of their total mass. On the other hand, the first neutron star\nmerger appears at a higher metallicity in galaxies with a dynamical time\nshorter than typical neutron star merger times. The scatters of r-process\nelements mainly come from inhomogeneity of the metals in the interstellar\nmedium whereas the scatters of $\\alpha$-elements are mostly due to the\ndifference in the yield of each supernova. Our results demonstrate that the\nfuture observations of r-process elements in EMP stars will be able to\nconstrain the early chemo-dynamical evolution of the Local Group galaxies.\n", "  We present an analysis of photometric observations of the eclipsing novalike\nvariable DW UMa made by the CBA consortium between 1999 and 2015. Analysis of\n372 new and 260 previously published eclipse timings reveals a 13.6 year period\nor quasi-period in the times of minimum light. The seasonal light curves show a\ncomplex spectrum of periodic signals: both positive and negative superhumps,\nlikely arising from a prograde apsidal precession and a retrograde nodal\nprecession of the accretion disc. These signals appear most prominently and\nfamously as sidebands of the orbital frequency but the precession frequencies\nthemselves, at 0.40 and 0.22 cycles per day, are also seen directly in the\npower spectrum. The superhumps are sometimes seen together and sometimes\nseparately. The depth, width and skew of eclipses are all modulated in phase\nwith both nodal and apsidal precession of the tilted and eccentric accretion\ndisc. The superhumps, or more correctly the precessional motions which produce\nthem, may be essential to understanding the mysterious SW Sextantis syndrome.\nDisc wobble and eccentricity can both produce Doppler signatures inconsistent\nwith the true dynamical motions in the binary, and disc wobble might boost the\nmass-transfer rate by enabling the hot white dwarf to directly irradiate the\nsecondary star.\n", "  In this work we study the dynamics of the Local Group (LG) within the context\nof cosmological models beyond General Relativity (GR). Using observable\nkinematic quantities to identify candidate pairs we build up samples of\nsimulated LG-like objects drawing from $f(R)$, symmetron, DGP and quintessence\nN-body simulations together with their $\\Lambda$CDM counterparts featuring the\nsame initial random phase realisations. The variables and intervals used to\ndefine LG-like objects are referred to as Local Group model; different models\nare used throughout this work and adapted to study their dynamical and\nkinematic properties. The aim is to determine how well the observed LG-dynamics\ncan be reproduced within cosmological theories beyond GR, We compute kinematic\nproperties of samples drawn from alternative theories and $\\Lambda$CDM and\ncompare them to actual observations of the LG mass, velocity and position. As a\nconsequence of the additional pull, pairwise tangential and radial velocities\nare enhanced in modified gravity and coupled dark energy with respect to\n$\\Lambda$CDM, inducing significant changes to the total angular momentum and\nenergy of the LG. For example, in models such as $f(R)$ and the symmetron this\nincrease can be as large as $60\\%$, peaking well outside of the $95\\%$\nconfidence region allowed by the data. This shows how simple considerations\nabout the LG dynamics can lead to clear small-scale observational signatures\nfor alternative scenarios, without the need of expensive high-resolution\nsimulations.\n", "  Over the past years type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have become a major tool to\ndetermine the expansion history of the Universe, and considerable attention has\nbeen given to, both, observations and models of these events. However, until\nnow, their progenitors are not known. The observed diversity of light curves\nand spectra seems to point at different progenitor channels and explosion\nmechanisms. Here, we present a new way to compare model predictions with\nobservations in a systematic way. Our method is based on the construction of a\nmetric space for SN Ia spectra by means of linear Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), taking care of missing and/or noisy data, and making use of Partial\nLeast Square regression (PLS) to find correlations between spectral properties\nand photometric data. We investigate realizations of the three major classes of\nexplosion models that are presently discussed: delayed-detonation\nChandrasekhar-mass explosions, sub-Chandrasekhar-mass detonations, and\ndouble-degenerate mergers, and compare them with data. We show that in the PC\nspace all scenarios have observed counterparts, supporting the idea that\ndifferent progenitors are likely. However, all classes of models face problems\nin reproducing the observed correlations between spectral properties and light\ncurves and colors. Possible reasons are briefly discussed.\n", "  We present the first scattered-light images of the debris disk around 49\nceti, a ~40 Myr A1 main sequence star at 59 pc, famous for hosting two massive\ndust belts as well as large quantities of atomic and molecular gas. The outer\ndisk is revealed in reprocessed archival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS F110W\nimages, as well as new coronagraphic H band images from the Very Large\nTelescope SPHERE instrument. The disk extends from 1.1\" (65 AU) to 4.6\" (250\nAU), and is seen at an inclination of 73degr, which refines previous\nmeasurements at lower angular resolution. We also report no companion detection\nlarger than 3 M_Jup at projected separations beyond 20 AU from the star\n(0.34\"). Comparison between the F110W and H-band images is consistent with a\ngrey color of 49 ceti's dust, indicating grains larger than >2microns. Our\nphotometric measurements indicate a scattering efficiency / infrared excess\nratio of 0.2-0.4, relatively low compared to other characterized debris disks.\nWe find that 49 ceti presents morphological and scattering properties very\nsimilar to the gas-rich HD 131835 system. From our constraint on the disk\ninclination we find that the atomic gas previously detected in absorption must\nextend to the inner disk, and that the latter must be depleted of CO gas.\nBuilding on previous studies, we propose a schematic view of the system\ndescribing the dust and gas structure around 49 ceti and hypothetic scenarios\nfor the gas nature and origin.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength photometric catalog in the COSMOS field as part\nof the observations by the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic\nLegacy Survey (CANDELS). The catalog is based on Hubble Space Telescope Wide\nField Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observations of\nthe COSMOS field (centered at RA: $10^h00^m28^s$,\nDec:$+02^{\\circ}12^{\\prime}21^{\\prime\\prime}$). The final catalog has 38671\nsources with photometric data in forty two bands from UV to the infrared ($\\rm\n\\sim 0.3-8\\,\\mu m$). This includes broad-band photometry from the HST, CFHT,\nSubaru, VISTA and Spitzer Space Telescope in the visible, near infrared and\ninfrared bands along with intermediate and narrow-band photometry from Subaru\nand medium band data from Mayall NEWFIRM. Source detection was conducted in the\nWFC3 F160W band (at $\\rm 1.6\\,\\mu m$) and photometry is generated using the\nTemplate FITting algorithm. We further present a catalog of the physical\nproperties of sources as identified in the HST F160W band and measured from the\nmulti-band photometry by fitting the observed spectral energy distributions of\nsources against templates.\n", "  Jet powers in many radio galaxies with extended radio structures appear to\nexceed their associated accretion luminosities. In systems with very low\naccretion rates, this is likely due to the very low accretion luminosities\nresulting from radiatively inefficient accretion flows. In systems with high\naccretion rates, the accretion flows are expected to be radiatively efficient,\nand the production of such powerful jets may require an accretion scenario\nwhich involves magnetically arrested discs (MADs). However, numerical\nsimulations of the MAD scenario indicate that jet production efficiency is\nlarge only for geometrically thick accretion flows and scales roughly with\n$(H/R)^2$, where $H$ is the disc height and $R$ is the distance from the BH.\nUsing samples of FRII radio galaxies and quasars accreting at moderate\naccretion rates we show that their jets are much more powerful than predicted\nby the MAD scenario. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy,\nsuggesting that it can be related to approximations adopted in MHD simulations\nto treat optically thick accretion flow within the MAD-zone, or may indicate\nthat accretion disks are geometrically thicker than the standard theory\npredicts.\n", "  Experimental techniques using Bragg diffraction may elucidate electronic and\nmagnetic properties of ferric ions in multiferroic ScFeO3 that are puzzling. A\ncollinear magnetic motif of dipole moments is not expected for s-state ions\nwith an acentric parent (paramagnetic) structure, because single-site\nanisotropy is negligible and antisymmetric exchange interactions promote an\ninhomogeneous magnetic motif. However, current indications are that ScFeO3\nsupports G-type antiferromagnetism, with an unknown moment direction, which\nimplies that ferric ions are not in the high-spin 6S state. It is argued that\nsignificant insight on these open questions can be achieved by confronting\nexperimental data with calculated structure factors for resonant x-ray and\nmagnetic neutron Bragg spots, and we report results for G-type\nantiferromagnetism allowed by the corundum-like parent R3c structure.\nCalculated structure factors include Dirac multipoles that are time-odd and\nparity-odd, e.g., dipoles that are often called anapoles or toroidal moments.\n", "  Deuterated species are unique and powerful tools in astronomy since they can\nprobe the physical conditions, chemistry, and ionization level of various\nastrophysical media. Recent observations of several deuterated species along\nwith some of their spin isomeric forms have rekindled the interest for more\naccurate studies on deuterium fractionation. This paper presents the first\npublicly available chemical network of multiply deuterated species along with\nspin chemistry implemented on the latest state-of-the-art gas-grain chemical\ncode `NAUTILUS'. D/H ratios for all deuterated species observed at different\npositions of TMC-1 are compared with the results of our model, which considers\nmultiply deuterated species along with the spin chemistry of light hydrogen\nbearing species H2, H2+, H3+ and their isotopologues. We also show the\ndifferences in the modeled abundances of non-deuterated species after the\ninclusion of deuteration and spin chemistry in the model. Finally, we present a\nlist of potentially observable deuterated species in TMC-1 awaiting detection.\n", "  The magnetic-field dependence of the energy spectrum, wave function, binding\nenergy and oscillator strength of exciton states confined in a circular\ngraphene quantum dot (CGQD) are obtained within the configuration interaction\n(CI) method. We predict that: (1) excitonic effects are very significant in the\nCGQD as a consequence of a combination of geometric confinement, magnetic\nconfinement and reduced screening; (2) two types of excitons (intravalley and\nintervalley excitons) are present in the CGQD because of the valley degree of\nfreedom in graphene; (3) the intravalley and intervalley exciton states display\ndifferent magnetic-field dependencies due to the different electron-hole\nsymmetries of the single-particle energy spectra; (4) with increasing magnetic\nfield, the exciton ground state in the CGQD undergoes an intravalley to\nintervalley transition accompanied by a change of angular momentum; (5) the\nexciton binding energy does not increase monotonically with the magnetic field\ndue to the competition between geometric and magnetic confinements; and (6) the\noptical transitions of the intervalley and intravalley excitons can be tuned by\nthe magnetic field and valley-dependent excitonic transitions can be realized\nin CGQD.\n", "  We present a sample of eight cataclysmic variables (CVs) identified among the\nX-ray sources of the 400 square degree (400d) X-ray ROSAT/PSPC survey. Based on\nthis sample, we have obtained preliminary constraints on the X-ray luminosity\nfunction of CVs in the solar neighbourhood in the range of low luminosities,\nL_X=~1e29-1e30 erg/s (0.5-2 keV). We show that the logarithmic slope of the CV\nluminosity function in this luminosity range is less steep than that at\nL_X>1e31 erg/s. Our results show that of order of thousand CVs will be detected\nin the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey at high Galactic latitudes, which will allow\nto obtain much more accurate measurements of their X-ray luminosity function.\n", "  We report on observations of an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave event in the\nSun on 2011 January 13 by \\emph{Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory}\n(\\emph{STEREO}) and \\emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory} (\\emph{SDO}) in\nquadrature. Both the trailing edge and the leading edge of the EUV wave front\nin the north direction are reliably traced, revealing generally compatible\npropagation velocities in both perspectives and a velocity ratio of about 1/3.\nWhen the wave front encounters a coronal cavity near the northern polar coronal\nhole, the trailing edge of the front stops while its leading edge just shows a\nsmall gap and extends over the cavity, meanwhile getting significantly\ndecelerated but intensified. We propose that the trailing edge and the leading\nedge of the northward propagating wave front correspond to a non-wave coronal\nmass ejection (CME) component and a fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave\ncomponent, respectively. The interaction of the fast-mode wave and the coronal\ncavity may involve a mode conversion process, through which part of the\nfast-mode wave is converted to a slow-mode wave that is trapped along the\nmagnetic field lines. This scenario can reasonably account for the unusual\nbehavior of the wave front over the coronal cavity.\n", "  Planetesimal belts are invoked to explain the prolonged existence of debris\ndisks. Important parameters to model their collisional evolution and to compute\nthe dust production rate are the intrinsic probability of collision $P_i$ and\nthe mean impact velocity $U_c$. If a planet orbits close to the belt, the\nvalues of both these parameters are affected by its secular perturbations\nyielding a strong correlation between eccentricity $e$ and pericentre longitude\n$\\varpi$. We adopt a new algorithm to compute both $P_i$ and $U_c$ in presence\nof various levels of secular correlation due to different ratios between proper\nand forced eccentricity. We tested this algorithm in a standard case with a\nJupiter--sized planet orbiting inside a putative planetesimal belt finding that\nit is less collisionally active compared to a self--stirred belt because of the\n$e - \\varpi$ coupling. The eccentricity of the planet is an important parameter\nin determining the amount of dust production since the erosion rate is 10 times\nfaster when the planet eccentricity increases from 0.1 to 0.6. Also the initial\nconditions of the belt (either warm or cold) and its average inclination\nstrongly affects $P_i$ and $U_c$ and then its long term collisional evolution\nin presence of the planet. We finally apply our method to the planetesimal\nbelts supposedly refilling the dust disks around HD 38529 and $\\epsilon$\nEridani. In the most collisionally active configurations, only a small fraction\nof bodies smaller than 100 km are expected to be fragmented over a time--span\nof 4 Gyr.\n", "  We use the Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain\ndeep, high-resolution photometry of the young (~ 100 Myr) star cluster NGC1850\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud. We analyze the cluster colour-magnitude diagram\n(CMD) and find that it hosts an extended main sequence turn-off (MSTO) and a\ndouble MS. We demonstrate that these features cannot be due to photometric\nerrors, field star contamination, or differential reddening. From a comparison\nwith theoretical models and Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a coeval\nstellar population featuring a distribution of stellar rotation rates can\nreproduce the MS split quite well. However, it cannot reproduce the observed\nMSTO region, which is significantly wider than the simulated ones. Exploiting\nnarrow-band Halpha imaging, we find that the MSTO hosts a population of\nHalpha-emitting stars which are interpreted as rapidly rotating Be-type stars.\nWe explore the possibility that the discrepancy between the observed MSTO\nmorphology and that of the simulated simple stellar population (SSP) is caused\nby the fraction of these objects that are highly reddened, but we rule out this\nhypothesis. We demonstrate that the global CMD morphology is well-reproduced by\na combination of SSPs that cover an age range of ~ 35 Myr as well as a wide\nvariety of rotation rates. We derive the cluster mass and escape velocity and\nuse dynamical evolution models to predict their evolution starting at an age of\n10 Myr. We discuss these results and their implications in the context of the\nextended MSTO phenomenon.\n", "  We present Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Cycle-2\nobservations of the HBC 494 molecular outflow and envelope. HBC 494 is an FU\nOri-like object embedded in the Orion A cloud and is associated with the\nreflection nebulae Re50 and Re50N. We use $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O\nspectral line data to independently describe the outflow and envelope\nstructures associated with HBC 494. The moment-1 map of the $^{12}$CO emission\nshows the widest outflow cavities in a Class I object known to date (opening\nangle $\\sim$ 150$^{^{\\circ}}$). The morphology of the wide outflow is likely to\nbe due to the interaction between winds originating in the inner disc and the\nsurrounding envelope. The low-velocity blue- and red-shifted $^{13}$CO and\nC$^{18}$O emission trace the rotation and infall motion of the circumstellar\nenvelope. Using molecular line data and adopting standard methods for\ncorrecting optical depth effects, we estimate its kinematic properties,\nincluding an outflow mass on the order of 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Considering\nthe large estimated outflow mass for HBC 494, our results support recent\ntheoretical work suggesting that wind-driven processes might dominate the\nevolution of protoplanetary discs via energetic outflows.\n", "  Nearly all Galactic globular clusters host stars that display characteristic\nabundance anti-correlations, like the O-rich/Na-poor pattern typical of field\nhalo stars, together with O-poor/Na-rich additional components. A recent\nspectroscopic investigation questioned the presence of O-poor/Na-rich stars\namongst a sample of asymptotic giant branch stars in the cluster M 4, at\nvariance with the spectroscopic detection of a O-poor/Na-rich component along\nboth the cluster red giant branch and horizontal branch. This is contrary to\nwhat is expected from the cluster horizontal branch morphology and horizontal\nbranch stellar evolution models. Here we have investigated this issue by\nemploying the CUBI= (U-B)-(B-I) index, that previous studies have demonstrated\nto be very effective in separating multiple populations along both the red\ngiant and asymptotic giant branch sequences. We confirm previous results that\nthe RGB is intrinsically broad in the V-CUBI diagram, with the presence of two\ncomponents which nicely correspond to the two populations identified by\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. We find that AGB stars are distributed over a\nwide range of CUBI values, in close analogy with what is observed for the RGB,\ndemonstrating that the AGB of M4 also hosts multiple stellar populations.\n", "  The electronic conductance of graphene-based bilayer flake systems reveal\ndifferent quantum interference effects, such as Fabry-P\\'erot resonances and\nsharp Fano antiresonances on account of competing electronic paths through the\ndevice. These properties may be exploited to obtain spin-polarized currents\nwhen the same nanostructure is deposited above a ferromagnetic insulator. Here\nwe study how the spin-dependent conductance is affected when a time-dependent\ngate potential is applied to the bilayer flake. Following a Tien-Gordon\nformalism we explore how to modulate the transport properties of such systems\nvia appropriate choices of the $ac$-field gate parameters. The presence of the\noscillating field opens the possibility of tuning the original antiresonances\nfor a large set of field parameters. We show that interference patterns can be\npartially or fully removed by the time-dependent gate voltage. The results are\nreflected in the corresponding weighted spin polarization which can reach\nmaximum values for a given spin component. We found that differential\nconductance maps as functions of bias and gate potentials show interference\npatterns for different $ac$-field parameter configurations. The proposed\nbilayer graphene flake systems may be used as a frequency detector in the THz\nrange.\n", "  Hydrogen gas evaporating from the atmosphere of the hot-Neptune GJ436b\nabsorbs over 50% of the stellar Ly$\\alpha$ emission during transit. Given the\nplanet's atmospheric composition and energy-limited escape rate, this hydrogen\noutflow is expected to entrain heavier atoms such as C and O. We searched for C\nand Si in the escaping atmosphere of GJ436b using far-ultraviolet HST COS G130M\nobservations made during the planet's extended H I transit. These observations\nshow no transit absorption in the C II 1334,1335 \\AA\\ and Si III 1206 \\AA\\\nlines integrated over [-100, 100] km s$^{-1}$, imposing 95% (2$\\sigma$) upper\nlimits of 14% (C II) and 60% (Si III) depth on the transit of an opaque disk\nand 22% (C II) and 49% (Si III) depth on an extended, highly asymmetric transit\nsimilar to that of H I Ly$\\alpha$. C$^+$ is likely present in the outflow\naccording to a simulation we carried out using a spherically-symmetric,\nphotochemical-hydrodynamical model. This simulation predicts a $\\sim$2% transit\nover the integrated bandpass, consistent with the data. At line center, we\npredict the C II transit depth to be as high as 19%. Our model predicts a\nneutral hydrogen escape rate of $1.6\\times10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$ ($3.1\\times10^{9}$\ng s$^{-1}$ for all species) for an upper atmosphere composed of hydrogen and\nhelium.\n", "  We address the presently exciting issue of the presence of stellar clusters\nin the periphery of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and beyond by making use of a\nwealth of wide-field high-quality images released in advance from the\nMagellanic Stellar Hystory (SMASH) survey. We conducted a sound search for new\nstellar cluster candidates from suitable kernel density estimators running for\nappropriate ranges of radii and stellar densities. In addition, we used a\nfunctional relationship to account for the completeness of the SMASH field\nsample analyzed that takes into account not only the number of fields used but\nalso their particular spatial distribution; the present sample statistically\nrepresents ~ 50$% of the whole SMASH survey. The relative small number of new\nstellar cluster candidates identified, most of them distributed in the outer\nregions of the Magellanic Clouds, might suggest that the lack of detection of a\nlarger number of new cluster candidates beyond the main bodies of the\nMagellanic Clouds could likely be the outcome once the survey be completed.\n", "  Possible violations of Lorentz invariance (LIV) have been investigated for a\nlong time using the observed spectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However,\nthese generally have relied on using a single photon in the highest energy\nrange. Furthermore, the search for LIV lags has been hindered by our ignorance\nconcerning the intrinsic time lag in different energy bands. GRB 160625B, the\nonly burst so far with a well-defined transition from $positive$ lags to\n$negative$ lags provides a unique opportunity to put new constraints on LIV.\nUsing multi-photon energy bands we consider the contributions to the observed\nspectral lag from both the intrinsic time lag and the lag by LIV effects, and\nassuming the intrinsic time lag to have a positive dependence on the photon\nenergy, we obtain robust limits on LIV by directly fitting the spectral lag\ndata of GRB 160625B. Here we show that these robust limits on the quantum\ngravity energy scales are $E_{\\rm QG,1}\\geq0.5\\times10^{16}$ GeV for the\nlinear, and $E_{\\rm QG,2}\\geq1.4\\times10^{7}$ GeV for the quadratic LIV\neffects, respectively. In addition, we give for the first time a reasonable\nformulation of the intrinsic energy-dependent time lag.\n", "  We highlight phenomenological aspects of Verlinde's recent proposal to\naccount for the mass anomalies in galactic systems without dark matter -- in\nparticular in their relation to MOND. Welcome addition to the MOND lore as it\nis, this approach have reproduced, so far, only a small fraction of MOND\nphenomenology, and is still rather tentative, both in its theoretical\nfoundations and in its phenomenology. What Verlinde has extracted from this\napproach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no\nroad to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a\nspherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it\ncannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to\nconduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.\nThe formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in\nan external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is\nbacked by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely\napplied to all the above phenomena, and more. Verlinde's formula, as it now\nstands, strongly conflicts with solar-system and possibly earth-surface\nconstraints, and cannot fully account for the mass anomalies in the cores of\ngalaxy clusters (a standing conundrum in MOND). The recent weak-lensing test of\nthe formula is, in fact, testing a cornerstone prediction of MOND, one that the\nformula does reproduce, and which has been tested before in the very same way.\n", "  We report the result from observations conducted with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to detect [CII] 158 um fine structure\nline emission from galaxies embedded in one of the most spectacular Lyman-alpha\nblobs (LABs) at z=3.1, SSA22-LAB1. Of three dusty star-forming galaxies\npreviously discovered by ALMA 860 um dust continuum survey toward SSA22-LAB1,\nwe detected the [CII] line from one, LAB1-ALMA3 at z=3.0993+/-0.0004. No line\nemission was detected, associated with the other ALMA continuum sources or from\nthree rest-frame UV/optical selected z_spec~3.1 galaxies within the field of\nview. For LAB1-ALMA3, we find relatively bright [CII] emission compared to the\ninfrared luminosity (L_[CII]/L_[CII]) and an extremely high [CII] 158 um and\n[NII] 205 um emission line ratio (L_[CII]/L_[NII]>55). The relatively strong\n[CII] emission may be caused by abundant photodissociation regions and\nsub-solar metallicity, or by shock heating. The origin of the unusually strong\n[CII] emission could be causally related to the location within the giant LAB,\nalthough the relationship between extended Lyman-alpha emission and ISM\nconditions of associated galaxies is yet to be understand.\n", "  We present an investigation of the supernova remnant (SNR) G306.3$-$0.9 using\narchival multi-wavelength data. The Suzaku spectra are well described by\ntwo-component thermal plasma models: The soft component is in ionization\nequilibrium and has a temperature $\\sim$0.59 keV, while the hard component has\ntemperature $\\sim$3.2 keV and ionization time-scale $\\sim$$2.6\\times10^{10}$\ncm$^{-3}$ s. We clearly detected Fe K-shell line at energy of $\\sim$6.5 keV\nfrom this remnant. The overabundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe confirm that the\nX-ray emission has an ejecta origin. The centroid energy of the Fe-K line\nsupports that G306.3$-$0.9 is a remnant of a Type Ia supernova (SN) rather than\na core-collapse SN. The GeV gamma-ray emission from G306.3$-$0.9 and its\nsurrounding were analyzed using about 6 years of Fermi data. We report about\nthe non-detection of G306.3$-$0.9 and the detection of a new extended gamma-ray\nsource in the south-west of G306.3$-$0.9 with a significance of\n$\\sim$13$\\sigma$. We discuss several scenarios for these results with the help\nof data from other wavebands to understand the SNR and its neighborhood.\n", "  Current models of Solar System evolution posit that the asteroid populations\nin resonance with Jupiter are comprised of objects scattered inward from the\nouter Solar System during a period of dynamical instability. In this paper, we\npresent a new analysis of the absolute magnitude and optical color distribution\nof Hilda asteroids, which lie in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter,\nwith the goal of comparing the bulk properties with previously published\nresults from an analogous study of Jupiter Trojans. We report an updated power\nlaw fit of the Hilda magnitude distribution through H=14. Using photometric\ndata listed in the Sloan Moving Object Catalog, we confirm the\npreviously-reported strong bimodality in visible spectral slope distribution,\nindicative of two sub-populations with differing surface compositions. When\nconsidering collisional families separately, we find that collisional fragments\nfollow a unimodal color distribution with spectral slope values consistent with\nthe bluer of the two sub-populations. The color distributions of Hildas and\nTrojans are comparable and consistent with a scenario in which the color\nbimodality in both populations developed prior to emplacement into their\npresent-day locations. We propose that the shallower magnitude distribution of\nthe Hildas is a result of an initially much larger Hilda population, which was\nsubsequently depleted as smaller bodies were preferentially ejected from the\nnarrow 3:2 resonance via collisions. Altogether, these observations provide a\nstrong case supporting a common origin for Hildas and Trojans as predicted by\ncurrent dynamical instability theories of Solar System evolution.\n", "  We present the X-ray point source population of NGC 7457 based on 124 ks of\nChandra observations. Previous deep Chandra observations of low mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) in early-type galaxies have typically targeted the large\npopulations of massive galaxies. NGC 7457 is a nearby, early-type galaxy with a\nstellar luminosity of $1.7\\times10^{10} L_{K\\odot}$, allowing us to investigate\nthe populations in a relatively low mass galaxy. We classify the detected X-ray\nsources into field LMXBs, globular cluster LMXBs, and background AGN based on\nidentifying optical counterparts in new HST/ACS images. We detect 10 field\nLMXBs within the $r_{ext}$ ellipse of NGC 7457 (with semi-major axis $\\sim$ 9.1\nkpc, ellipticity = 0.55). The corresponding number of LMXBs with\n$L_{x}>2\\times10^{37}erg/s$ per stellar luminosity is consistent with that\nobserved in more massive galaxies, $\\sim 7$ per $10^{10} L_{K\\odot}$. We detect\na small globular cluster population in these HST data and show that its colour\ndistribution is likely bimodal and that its specific frequency is similar to\nthat of other early type galaxies. However, no X-ray emission is detected from\nany of these clusters. Using published data for other galaxies, we show that\nthis non-detection is consistent with the small stellar mass of these clusters.\nWe estimate that 0.11 (and 0.03) LMXBs are expected per $10^{6}M_{\\odot}$ in\nmetal-rich (and metal-poor) globular clusters. This corresponds to 1100 (and\n330) LMXBs per $10^{10} L_{K\\odot}$, highlighting the enhanced formation\nefficiency of LMXBs in globular clusters. A nuclear X-ray source is detected\nwith $L_{x}$ varying from $2.8-6.8\\times10^{38}erg/s$. Combining this $L_{x}$\nwith a published dynamical mass estimate for the central SMBH in NGC 7457, we\nfind that $L_{x}/L_{Edd}$ varies from $0.5-1.3\\times10^{-6}$.\n", "  We use optical spectra from the inner 2$\\times$3kpc$^2$ of the Seyfert 2\ngalaxy NGC1667, obtained with the GMOS integral field spectrograph on the\nGemini South telescope at a spatial resolution of $\\approx$ 240pc, to assess\nthe feeding and feedback processes in this nearby AGN. We have identified two\ngaseous kinematical components in the emission line profiles: a broader\ncomponent ($\\sigma\\approx$ 400km s$^{-1}$) which is observed in the inner\n1-2arcsec and a narrower component ($\\sigma\\approx$ 200km s$^{-1}$) which is\npresent over the entire field-of-view. We identify the broader component as due\nto an unresolved nuclear outflow. The narrower component velocity field shows\nstrong isovelocity twists relative to a rotation pattern, implying the presence\nof strong non-circular motions. The subtraction of a rotational model reveals\nthat these twists are caused by outflowing gas in the inner $\\approx$ 1arcsec,\nand by inflows associated with two spiral arms at larger radii. We calculate an\nionized gas mass outflow rate of $\\dot{M}_{out}\\approx$\n0.16M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. We calculate the net gas mass flow rate across a\nseries of concentric rings, obtaining a maximum mass inflow rate in ionized gas\nof $\\approx$ 2.8M$_{\\odot}$year$^{-1}$ at 800pc from the nucleus, which is two\norders of magnitude larger than the accretion rate necessary to power this AGN.\nHowever, as the mass inflow rate decreases at smaller radii, most of the gas\nprobably will not reach the AGN, but accumulate in the inner few hundred\nparsecs. This will create a reservoir of gas that can trigger the formation of\nnew stars.\n", "  We present near--infrared (NIR) imaging of FBQS J164442.5+261913, one of the\nfew $\\gamma$--ray emitting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 ($\\gamma-$NLSy1) galaxies\ndetected at high significance level by $Fermi$--LAT. This study is the first\nmorphological analysis performed of this source and the third performed of this\nclass of objects. Conducting a detailed two--dimensional modeling of its\nsurface brightness distribution and analysing its $J-K_s$ colour gradients, we\nfind that FBQS J164442.5+261913 is statistically most likely hosted by a barred\nlenticular galaxy (SB0). We find evidence that the bulge in the host galaxy of\nFBQS J164442.5+261913 is not classical but pseudo, against the paradigm of\npowerful relativistic jets exclusively launched by giant ellipticals. Our\nanalysis, also reveal the presence of a ring with diameter equalling the bar\nlength ($r_{bar} = 8.13\\ \\textrm{kpc}\\pm 0.25$), whose origin might be a\ncombination of bar--driven gas rearrangement and minor mergers, as revealed by\nthe apparent merger remnant in the $J$--band image. In general, our results\nsuggest that the prominent bar in the host galaxy of FBQS J164442.5+261913 has\nmostly contributed to its overall morphology driving a strong secular\nevolution, which plays a crucial role in the onset of the nuclear activity and\nthe growth of the massive bulge. Minor mergers, in conjunction, are likely to\nprovide the necessary fresh supply of gas to the central regions of the host\ngalaxy.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of a damped harmonic oscillator is investigated in the\npresence of an anisotropic heat bath. The medium is modeled by a continuum of\nthree dimensional harmonic oscillators and anisotropic coupling is treated by\nintroducing tensor coupling functions. Starting from a classical Lagrangian,\nthe total system is quantized in the framework of the canonical quantization.\nFollowing Fano technique, Hamiltonian of the system is diagonalized in terms of\ncreation and annihilation operators that are linear combinations of the basic\ndynamical variables. Using the diagonalized Hamiltonian, the mean force\ninternal energy, free energy and entropy of the damped oscillator are\ncalculated.\n", "  The decrease in star formation (SF) and the morphological change necessary to\nproduce the $z=0$ elliptical galaxy population are commonly ascribed to a\nsudden quenching event, which is able to rid the central galaxy of its cold gas\nreservoir in a short time. Following this event, the galaxy is able to prevent\nfurther SF and stay quiescent via a maintenance mode. We test whether such a\nquenching event is truly necessary using a simple model of quiescence. In this\nmodel, hot gas (all gas above a temperature threshold) in a $\\sim10^{12}\nM_{\\odot}$ halo mass galaxy at redshift $z\\sim3$ is prevented from cooling. The\ncool gas continues to form stars at a decreasing rate and the galaxy stellar\nmass, morphology, velocity dispersion and position on the color magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) proceed to evolve. By $z=0$, the halo mass has grown to $10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$ and the galaxy has attained characteristics typical of an observed\n$z=0$ elliptical galaxy. Our model is run in the framework of a cosmological,\nsmooth particle hydrodynamic code which includes SF, early stellar feedback,\nsupernova feedback, metal cooling and metal diffusion. Additionally, we\npost-process our simulations with a radiative transfer code to create a mock\nCMD. In contrast to previous assumptions that a pure \"fade away\" model evolves\ntoo slowly to account for the sparsity of galaxies in the \"green valley\", we\ndemonstrate crossing times of $<$1 Gyr. We conclude that no sudden quenching\nevent is necessary to produce such rapid colour transitions.\n", "  The aim of this work is to study the imprints that different models for black\nhole (BH) and neutron star (NS) formation have on the Galactic distribution of\nX-ray binaries (XRBs) which contain these objects. We find that the root mean\nsquare of the height above the Galactic plane of BH- and NS-XRBs is a powerful\nproxy to discriminate among different formation scenarios, and that binary\nevolution following the BH/NS formation does not significantly affect the\nGalactic distributions of the binaries. We find that a population model in\nwhich at least some BHs receive a (relatively) high natal kick fits the\nobserved BH-XRBs best. For the NS case, we find that a high NK distribution,\nconsistent with the one derived from the measurement of pulsar proper motion,\nis the most preferable. We also analyse the simple method we previously used to\nestimate the minimal peculiar velocity of an individual BH-XRB at birth. We\nfind that this method may be less reliable in the bulge of the Galaxy for\ncertain models of the Galactic potential, but that our estimate is excellent\nfor most of the BH-XRBs.\n", "  We examine by a perturbation method how the self-trapping of g-mode\noscillations in geometrically thin relativistic disks is affected by uniform\nvertical magnetic fields. Disks which we consider are isothermal in the\nvertical direction, but are truncated at a certain height by presence of hot\ncoronae. We find that the characteristics of self-trapping of axisymmetric\ng-mode oscillations in non-magnetized disks is kept unchanged in magnetized\ndisks at least till a strength of the fields, depending on vertical thickness\nof disks. These magnetic fields become stronger as the disk becomes thinner.\nThis result suggests that trapped g-mode oscillations still remain as one of\npossible candidates of quasi-periodic oscillations observed in black-hole and\nneutron-star X-ray binaries in the cases where vertical magnetic fields in\ndisks are weak.\n", "  We present a detailed optical and X-ray study of the 2013 outburst of the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud Be/X-ray binary SXP7.92, as well as an overview of the\nlast 18 years of observations from OGLE, RXTE, Chandra and XMM-Newton. We\nrevise the position of this source to RA(J2000)=00:57:58.4,\nDec(J2000)=-72:22:29.5 with a $1\\sigma$ uncertainty of 1.5 arcsec, correcting\nthe previously reported position by Coe et al. (2009) by more than 20\narcminutes. We identify and spectrally classify the correct counterpart as a\nB1Ve star. The optical spectrum is distinguished by an uncharacteristically\ndeep narrow Balmer series, with the H$\\alpha$ line in particular having a\ndistinctive shell profile, i.e. a deep absorption core embedded in an emission\nline. We interpret this as evidence that we are viewing the system edge on and\nare seeing self obscuration of the circumstellar disc. We derive an optical\nperiod for the system of 40.0$\\pm0.3$ days, which we interpret as the orbital\nperiod, and present several mechanisms to describe the X-ray/Optical behaviour\nin the recent outburst, in particular the \"flares\" and \"dips\" seen in the\noptical light curve, including a transient accretion disc and an elongated\nprecessing disc.\n", "  We extend the comparison between the set of local galaxies having dynamically\nmeasured black holes with galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We\nfirst show that the most up-to-date local black hole samples of early-type\ngalaxies with measurements of effective radii, luminosities, and S\\'ersic\nindices of the bulges of their host galaxies, have dynamical mass and S\\'ersic\nindex distributions consistent with those of SDSS early-type galaxies of\nsimilar bulge stellar mass. The host galaxies of local black hole samples thus\ndo not appear structurally different from SDSS galaxies, sharing similar\ndynamical masses, light profiles and light distributions. Analysis of the\nresiduals reveals that velocity dispersion is more fundamental than S\\'ersic\nindex n in the scaling relations between black holes and galaxies. Indeed,\nresiduals with S\\'ersic index could be ascribed to the (weak) correlation with\nbulge mass or even velocity dispersion. Finally, targetted Monte Carlo\nsimulations that include the effects of the sphere of influence of the black\nhole, and tuned to reproduce the observed residuals and scaling relations in\nterms of velocity dispersion and stellar mass, show that, at least for galaxies\nwith Mbulge > 1e10 Msun and n>5, the observed mean black hole mass at fixed\nS\\'ersic index is biased significantly higher than the intrinsic value.\n", "  We use deep HI observations obtained as part of the extended GALEX Arecibo\nSDSS survey (xGASS) to study the cold gas properties of central galaxies across\nenvironments. We find that, below stellar masses of 10^10.2 Msun, central\ngalaxies in groups have an average atomic hydrogen gas fraction ~0.3dex higher\nthan those in isolation at the same stellar mass. At these stellar masses,\ngroup central galaxies are usually found in small groups of N=2 members. The\nhigher HI content in these low mass group central galaxies is mirrored by their\nhigher average star formation activity and molecular hydrogen content. At\nlarger stellar masses, this difference disappears and central galaxies in\ngroups have similar (or even smaller) gas reservoirs and star formation\nactivity compared to those in isolation. We discuss possible scenarios able to\nexplain our findings and suggest that the higher gas content in low mass group\ncentral galaxies is likely due to contributions from the cosmic web or HI-rich\nminor mergers, which also fuel their enhanced star formation activity.\n", "  Protoplanetary disc systems observed at radio wavelengths often show excess\nemission above that expected from a simple extrapolation of thermal dust\nemission observed at short millimetre wavelengths. Monitoring the emission at\nradio wavelengths can be used to help disentangle the physical mechanisms\nresponsible for this excess, including free-free emission from a wind or jet,\nand chromospheric emission associated with stellar activity. We present new\nresults from a radio monitoring survey conducted with Australia Telescope\nCompact Array over the course of several years with observation intervals\nspanning days, months and years, where the flux variability of 11 T Tauri stars\nin the Chamaeleon and Lupus star forming regions was measured at 7 and 15 mm\nand 3 and 6 cm. Results show that for most sources are variable to some degree\nat 7 mm, indicating the presence of emission mechanisms other than thermal dust\nin some sources. Additionally, evidence of grain growth to cm-sized pebbles was\nfound for some sources that also have signs of variable flux at 7 mm. We\nconclude that multiple processes contributing to the emission are common in T\nTauri stars at 7 mm and beyond, and that a detection at a single epoch at radio\nwavelengths should not be used to determine all processes contributing to the\nemission.\n", "  We determine relative abundance ratios for the neutron-capture elements Zr,\nLa, Ce, Nd, and Eu for a sample of 27 Galactic dwarf stars with -1.5 < [Fe/H]\n<-0.8. We also measure the iron-peak element Sc. These stars separate into\nthree populations (low- and high-alpha halo and thick-disc stars) based on the\n[alpha/Fe] abundance ratio and their kinematics as discovered by Nissen &\nSchuster. We find differences between the low- and high-alpha groups in the\nabundance ratios of [Sc/Fe], [Zr/Fe], [La/Zr], [Y/Eu], and [Ba/Eu] when\nincluding Y and Ba from Nissen & Schuster. For all ratios except [La/Zr], the\nlow-alpha stars have a lower abundance compared to the high-alpha stars. The\nlow-alpha stars display the same abundance patterns of high [Ba/Y] and low\n[Y/Eu] as observed in present-day dwarf spheroidal galaxies, although with\nsmaller abundance differences, when compared to the high-alpha stars. These\ndistinct chemical patterns have been attributed to differences in the star\nformation rate between the two populations and the contribution of\nlow-metallicity, low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars to the low-alpha\npopulation. By comparing the low-alpha population with AGB stellar models, we\nplace constraints on the mass range of the AGB stars.\n", "  We present the HI eXtreme (HIX) galaxy survey targeting some of the most HI\nrich galaxies in the southern hemisphere. The 13 HIX galaxies have been\nselected to host the most massive HI discs at a given stellar luminosity. We\ncompare these galaxies to a control sample of average galaxies detected in the\nHI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS, Barnes et al. 2001). As the control sample is\nmatched in stellar luminosity, we find that the stellar properties of HIX\ngalaxies are similar to the control sample. Furthermore, the specific star\nformation rate and optical morphology do not differ between HIX and control\ngalaxies. We find, however, the HIX galaxies to be less efficient in forming\nstars. For the most HI massive galaxy in our sample (ESO075-G006, $\\rm log\\\nM_{HI}\\ [M_{\\odot}] = 10.8$) the kinematic properties are the reason for\ninefficient star formation and HI excess. Examining the Australian Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) HI imaging and Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) optical\nspectra of ESO075-G006 reveals an undisturbed galaxy without evidence for\nrecent major, violent accretion events. A tilted-ring fit to the HI disc\ntogether with the gas-phase oxygen abundance distribution supports the scenario\nthat gas has been constantly accreted onto ESO07-G006 but the high specific\nangular momentum makes ESO075-G006 very inefficient in forming stars. Thus a\nmassive HI disc has been built up.\n", "  Using galaxies as background light sources to map intervening Lya absorption\nis a novel approach to study the interplay among galaxies, the circum-galactic\nmedium (CGM), and the intergalactic medium (IGM). Introducing a new measure of\nz = 3.1$ HI Lya absorption relative to the cosmic mean, Delta_NB497, estimated\nfrom photometric data of star-forming galaxies at 3.3 < z < 3.5, we have made\ntwo-dimensional Delta_NB497 maps in the z = 3.1 SSA22 proto-cluster region and\ntwo control fields (SXDS and GOODS-N fields) with a spatial resolution of ~ 5\ncomoving Mpc. The Delta_NB497 measurements in the SSA22 field are\nsystematically larger than those in the control fields, and this HI absorption\nenhancement extends more than 50 comoving Mpc. The field-averaged (i.e., ~50\ncomoving Mpc scale) Delta_NB497 and the overdensity of Lya emitters (LAEs) seem\nto be correlated, while there is no clear dependency of the Delta_NB497 on the\nlocal LAE overdensity in a few comoving Mpc scale. These results suggest that\ndiffuse HI gas spreads out in/around the SSA22 proto-cluster. We have also\nfound an enhancement of Delta_NB497 at a projected distance < 100 physical kpc\nfrom the nearest z = 3.1 galaxies at least in the SSA22 field, which is\nprobably due to HI gas associated with the CGM of individual galaxies. The HI\nabsorption enhancement in the CGM-scale tends to be weaker around galaxies with\nstronger Lya emission, which suggests that the Lya escape fraction from\ngalaxies depends on hydrogen neutrality in the CGM.\n", "  We present UBVRI and CT1T2 photometry for fifteen catalogued open clusters of\nrelative high brightness and compact appearance. From these unprecedented\nphotometric data sets, covering wavelengths from the blue up to the\nnear-infrared, we performed a thorough assessment of their reality as stellar\naggregates. We statistically assigned to each observed star within the object\nregion a probability of being a fiducial feature of that field in terms of its\nlocal luminosity function, colour distribution and stellar density. Likewise,\nwe used accurate parallaxes and proper motions measured by the Gaia satellite\nto help our decision on the open cluster reality. Ten catalogued aggregates did\nnot show any hint of being real physical systems; three of them had been\nassumed to be open clusters in previous studies, though. On the other hand, we\nestimated reliable fundamental parameters for the remaining five studied\nobjects, which were confirmed as real open clusters. They resulted to be\nclusters distributed in a wide age range, 8.0 < log(t yr-1) < 9.4, of solar\nmetal content and placed between 2.0 and 5.5 kpc from the Sun. Their ages and\nmetallicities are in agreement with the presently known picture of the spatial\ndistribution of open clusters in the Galactic disc.\n", "  In recent years an increasing number of observational studies have hinted at\nthe presence of warps in protoplanetary discs, however a general comprehensive\ndescription of observational diagnostics of warped discs was missing. We\nperformed a series of 3D SPH hydrodynamic simulations and combined them with 3D\nradiative transfer calculations to study the observability of warps in\ncircumbinary discs, whose plane is misaligned with respect to the orbital plane\nof the central binary. Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous\nanalytical results on the dependence of the warp structure on the viscosity and\nthe initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the\nobservational signatures of warps we calculate images in the continuum at\nnear-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational\ntransition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface\nbrightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in\noptically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is\ncaused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the\nstrength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp. The projected\nvelocity field, derived from line observations, shows characteristic\ndeviations, twists and a change in the slope of the rotation curve, from that\nof an unperturbed disc. In extreme cases even the direction of rotation appears\nto change in the disc inwards of a characteristic radius. The strength of the\nkinematical signatures of warps decreases with increasing inclination. The\nstrength of all warp signatures decreases with decreasing viscosity.\n", "  Abell 1201 is a massive galaxy cluster at z=0.169 with a brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) that acts as a gravitational lens to a background source at\nz=0.451. The lensing configuration is unusual, with a single bright arc formed\nat small radius $\\sim$2 arcsec), where stars and dark matter are both expected\nto contribute substantially to the total lensing mass. Here, we present deep\nspectroscopic observations of the Abell 1201 BCG with MUSE, which reveal\nemission lines from a faint counter-image, opposite to the main arc, at a\nradius of 0.6 arcsec. We explore models in which the lensing mass is described\nby a combination of stellar mass and a standard dark-matter halo. The\ncounter-image is not predicted in such models, unless the dark-matter component\nis negligible, which would imply an extremely heavy stellar initial mass\nfunction (IMF) in this galaxy. We consider two modifications to the model which\ncan produce the observed configuration without resorting to extreme IMFs.\nImposing a radial gradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio, $\\Upsilon$, can\ngenerate a counter-image close to the observed position if $\\Upsilon$ increases\nby $\\gtrsim$60 per cent within the inner $\\sim$1 arcsec (e.g. variation from a\nMilky-Way-like to a Salpeter-like IMF). Alternatively, the counter-image can be\nproduced by introducing a central super-massive black hole. The required mass\nis $M_{\\rm BH}$ = (1.3$\\pm$0.6)$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$, which is comparable\nto the largest black holes known to date, several of which are also hosted by\nBCGs. We comment on future observations which promise to distinguish between\nthese alternatives.\n", "  We provide a comprehensive census of the near-Infrared (NIR, 0.8-2.4 $\\mu$m)\nspectroscopic properties of 102 nearby (z < 0.075) active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), selected in the hard X-ray band (14-195 keV) from the Swift-Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) survey. With the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope this\nregime is of increasing importance for dusty and obscured AGN surveys. We\nmeasure black hole masses in 68% (69/102) of the sample using broad emission\nlines (34/102) and/or the velocity dispersion of the Ca II triplet or the CO\nband-heads (46/102). We find that emission line diagnostics in the NIR are\nineffective at identifying bright, nearby AGN galaxies because ([Fe II]\n1.257$\\mu$m/Pa$\\beta$ and H$_2$ 2.12$\\mu$m/Br$\\gamma$) identify only 25%\n(25/102) as AGN with significant overlap with star forming galaxies and only\n20% of Seyfert 2 have detected coronal lines (6/30). We measure the coronal\nline emission in Seyfert 2 to be weaker than in Seyfert 1 of the same\nbolometric luminosity suggesting obscuration by the nuclear torus. We find that\nthe correlation between the hard X-ray and the [Si VI] coronal line luminosity\nis significantly better than with the [O III] luminosity. Finally, we find 3/29\ngalaxies (10%) that are optically classified as Seyfert 2 show broad emission\nlines in the NIR. These AGN have the lowest levels of obscuration among the\nSeyfert 2s in our sample ($\\log N_{\\rm H} < 22.43$ cm$^{-2}$), and all show\nsigns of galaxy-scale interactions or mergers suggesting that the optical broad\nemission lines are obscured by host galaxy dust.\n", "  Today the applications of nuclear physics span a very broad range of topics\nand fields. This review discusses a number of aspects of these applications,\nincluding selected topics and concepts in nuclear reactor physics, nuclear\nfusion, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear-geophysics, and nuclear medicine.\nThe review begins with a historic summary of the early years in applied nuclear\nphysics, with an emphasis on the huge developments that took place around the\ntime of World War II, and that underlie the physics involved in designs of\nnuclear explosions, controlled nuclear energy, and nuclear fusion. The review\nthen moves to focus on modern applications of these concepts, including the\nbasic concepts and diagnostics developed for the forensics of nuclear\nexplosions, the nuclear diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility, nuclear\nreactor safeguards, and the detection of nuclear material production and\ntrafficking. The review also summarizes recent developments in nuclear\ngeophysics and nuclear medicine. The nuclear geophysics areas discussed include\ngeo-chronology, nuclear logging for industry, the Oklo reactor, and\ngeo-neutrinos. The section on nuclear medicine summarizes the critical advances\nin nuclear imaging, including PET and SPECT imaging, targeted radionuclide\ntherapy, and the nuclear physics of medical isotope production. Each subfield\ndiscussed requires a review article onto itself, which is not the intention of\nthe current review. Rather, the current review is intended for readers who wish\nto get a broad understanding of applied nuclear physics.\n", "  We present an analysis of three new pulsating subdwarf B stars discovered in\nthe SuperWASP archive. Two of the stars, J1938+5609 and J0902-0720, are p-mode\npulsators; J1938+5609 shows a pulsation at 231.62 d$^{-1}$ ($P=373$ s; 2681\n$\\mu$Hz) with an amplitude of 4 mmag, whereas J0902-0720 pulsates at\nfrequencies 636.74 d$^{-1}$ ($P=136$ s; 7370 $\\mu$Hz) and 615.34 d$^{-1}$\n($P=140$ s; 7122 $\\mu$Hz), with amplitudes 7.27 and 1.53 mmag, respectively.\nThe third star, J2344-3427, is a hybrid pulsator with a p-mode frequency at\n223.16 d$^{-1}$ ($P=387$ s; 2583 $\\mu$Hz) and a corresponding amplitude of 1.5\nmmag, and g modes in the frequency range $8.68-28.56$ d$^{-1}$ ($P=3025-9954$\ns; $100-331$ $\\mu$Hz) and amplitudes between 0.76 and 1.17 mmag. Spectroscopic\nresults place J1938+5609 and J2344-3427 among the long-period or hybrid\npulsators, suggesting there may be further modes in these stars below our\ndetection limits, with J0902-0720 placed firmly amongst the p-mode pulsators.\n", "  HESS J1731$-$347 a.k.a. SNR G353.6$-$0.7 is one of the five known shell-type\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) emitting in the very high energy (VHE, Energy $>$ 0.1\nTeV) $\\gamma$-ray domain. We observed this TeV SNR with the Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) in 1390, 610 and 325 MHz bands. In this paper, we report\nthe discovery of 325 and 610 MHz radio counterparts of the SNR HESS J1731$-$347\nwith the GMRT. Various filaments of the SNR are clearly seen in the 325 and 610\nMHz bands. However, the faintest feature in the radio bands corresponds to the\npeak in VHE emission. We explain this anti-correlation in terms of a possible\nleptonic origin of the observed VHE $\\gamma$-ray emission. We determine the\nspectral indices of the bright individual filaments, which were detected in\nboth the 610 and the 325 MHz bands. Our values range from $-$1.11 to $-$0.15,\nconsistent with the non-thermal radio emission. We also report a possible radio\ncounterpart of a nearby TeV source HESS J1729$-$345 from the 843 MHz Molonglo\nGalactic Plane Survey and the 1.4 GHz Southern Galactic Plane Survey maps. The\npositive radio spectral index of this possible counterpart suggests a thermal\norigin of the radio emission of this nearby TeV source.\n", "  We present a measurements of electron and positron fluxes below the\ngeomagnetic cutoff rigidity in wide energy range from 50 MeV to several GeV by\nthe PAMELA magnetic spectrometer. The instrument was launched on June 15th 2006\non-board the Resurs-DK satellite on low orbit with 70 degrees inclination and\naltitude between 350 and 600 km. The procedure of trajectories calculations in\nthe geomagnetic field separates stably trapped and albedo components produced\nin interactions of cosmic ray protons with the residual atmosphere from\ngalactic cosmic rays. Features of spatial distributions of secondary electrons\nand positrons in the near Earth space, including the South Atlantic Anomaly,\nwere investigated.\n", "  We present linear polarization measurements of nearby FGK dwarfs to\nparts-per-million (ppm) precision. Before making any allowance for interstellar\npolarization, we found that the active stars within the sample have a mean\npolarization of 28.5 +/- 2.2 ppm while the inactive stars have a mean of 9.6\n+/- 1.5 ppm. Amongst inactive stars we initially found no difference between\ndebris disk host stars (9.1 +/- 2.5 ppm) and the other FGK dwarfs (9.9 +/- 1.9\nppm). We develop a model for the magnitude and direction of interstellar\npolarization for nearby stars. When we correct the observations for the\nestimated interstellar polarization we obtain 23.0 +/-2.2 ppm for the active\nstars, 7.8 +/- 2.9 ppm for the inactive debris disk host stars and 2.9 +/- 1.9\nppm for the other inactive stars. The data indicates that whilst some debris\ndisk host stars are intrinsically polarized most inactive FGK dwarfs have\nnegligible intrinsic polarization, but that active dwarfs have intrinsic\npolarization at levels ranging up to ~45 ppm. We briefly consider a number of\nmechanisms, and suggest differential saturation of spectral lines in the\npresence of magnetic fields is the best able to explain the polarization seen\nin active dwarfs. The results have implications for current attempts to detect\npolarized reflected light from hot Jupiters by looking at the combined light of\nthe star and planet.\n", "  A rate equation model for the dark and bright excitons kinetics is proposed\nwhich explains the wide variation in the observed degree of circular\npolarization of the PL emission in different TMDs monolayers. Our work suggests\nthat the dark exciton states play an important, and previously unsuspected role\nin determining the degree of polarization of the PL emission. A dark exciton\nground state provides a robust reservoir for valley polarization, which tries\nto maintain a Boltzmann distribution of the bright exciton states in the same\nvalley via the intra valley bright dark exciton scattering mechanism. The\ndependence of the degree of circular polarization on the detuning energy of the\nexcitation in MoSe$_2$ suggests that the electron-hole exchange interaction\ndominates over two LA phonon emission mechanism for inter valley scattering in\nTMDs.\n", "  We discuss recent observational data on the transverse and radial velocities,\nas well as on the masses of the main components of the Orion Trapezium. Based\non the most reliable values of these quantities we study the dynamical\nevolution of ensembles of multiple systems mimicking the Orion Trapezium. To\nthis end we conduct numerical $N-$body integrations using the observed masses,\nplanar positions and velocities, radial velocities, and random line-of-sight\n($z$) positions for all components. We include perturbations in these\nquantities compatible with the observational errors. We find the dynamical\nlifetimes of such systems to be quite short, of the order of 10 to 50 thousand\nyears. The end result of the simulations is usually a tight binary, or\nsometimes a hierarchical triple. The properties of the evolved systems are\nstudied at different values of the crossing times. The frequency distributions\nof the major semiaxes and eccentricities of the resulting binaries are\ndiscussed and compared with observations.\n", "  We study junctions of Wilson lines in refined SU(N) Chern-Simons theory and\ntheir local relations. We focus on junctions of Wilson lines in antisymmetric\nand symmetric powers of the fundamental representation and propose a set of\nlocal relations which realize one-parameter deformations of quantum groups\n$\\dot{U}_{q}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{m})$ and $\\dot{U}_{q}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{n|m})$.\n", "  We perform a resurgence analysis of the $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons partition\nfunction on a Brieksorn homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,5,7)$. Starting from an exact\nChern-Simons partition function, we study the Borel resummation of its\nperturbative expansion.\n", "  We report on a recent computation of the form factors in semi-leptonic decays\nof the $\\mathrm{B}_\\mathrm{s}$ using Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)\nformalism applied on the lattice. The connection of the form factors with the\n2-point and 3-point correlators on the lattice is explained, and the subsequent\nnon-perturbative renormalization of HQET and it's matching to $N_f=2$ QCD is\noutlined. The results of the (static) leading-order calculation in the\ncontinuum limit is presented.\n", "  Recently, compressed H$_2$S has been shown to become superconducting at 203 K\nunder a pressure of 155 GPa. One might expect fluctuations to dominate at such\ntemperatures. Using the magnetisation critical current, we determine the\nground-state London penetration depth, $\\lambda_0$=189 nm, and the\nsuperconducting energy gap, $\\Delta_0$=27.8 meV, and find these parameters are\nsimilar to those of cuprate superconductors. We also determine the fluctuation\ntemperature scale, $T_{\\textrm{fluc}}=1470$ K, which shows that, unlike the\ncuprates, $T_c$ of the hydride is not limited by fluctuations. This is due to\nits three dimensionality and suggests the search for better superconductors\nshould refocus on three-dimensional systems where the inevitable thermal\nfluctuations are less likely to reduce the observed $T_c$.\n", "  I breafly discuss very recent progress in the theoretical description of\nStandard Model single top production at hadron colliders.\n", "  A general virtual neutron experiment for TOF neutron reflectometer was\nintroduced, including instrument simulation, sample modeling, detector\nsimulation and data reduction to mimic the routine of real experimental process\nand data reduction. The reduced data fit quite well with the sample simulation,\nconfirming the reliability of our algorithm and the smearing effect was\nanalyzed. Methodology and algorithms developed in this study paves the way for\nthe future development of data processing and data reduction software for the\nTOF neutron reflectometers in China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS). Details\nof the virtual experiment and performance of the instrument was demonstrated.\n", "  The study of synchronization in populations of coupled biological oscillators\nis fundamental to many areas of biology to include neuroscience, cardiac\ndynamics and circadian rhythms. Studying these systems may involve tracking the\nconcentration of hundreds of variables in thousands of individual cells\nresulting in an extremely high-dimensional description of the system. However,\nfor many of these systems the behaviors of interest occur on a collective or\nmacroscopic scale. We define a new macroscopic reduction for networks of\ncoupled oscillators motivated by an elegant structure we find in experimental\nmeasurements of circadian gene expression and several mathematical models for\ncoupled biological oscillators. We characterize the emergence of this structure\nthrough a simple argument and demonstrate its applicability to stochastic and\nheterogeneous systems of coupled oscillators. Finally, we perform the\nmacroscopic reduction for the heterogeneous stochastic Kuramoto equation and\ncompare the low-dimensional macroscopic model with numerical results from the\nhigh-dimensional microscopic model.\n", "  Deep observations are revealing a growing number of young galaxies in the\nfirst billion year of cosmic time. Compared to typical galaxies at later times,\nthey show more extreme emission-line properties, higher star formation rates,\nlower masses, and smaller sizes. However, their faintness precludes studies of\ntheir chemical abundances and ionization conditions, strongly limiting our\nunderstanding of the physics driving early galaxy build-up and metal\nenrichment. Here we study a rare population of UV-selected, sub$-L^{*}$(z=3)\ngalaxies at redshift 2.4$<z<$3.5 that exhibit all the rest-frame properties\nexpected from primeval galaxies. These low-mass, highly-compact systems are\nrapidly-forming galaxies able to double their stellar mass in only few tens\nmillion years. They are characterized by very blue UV spectra with weak\nabsorption features and bright nebular emission lines, which imply hard\nradiation fields from young hot massive stars. Their highly-ionized gas phase\nhas strongly sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances, with metallicities more\nthan a factor of two lower than that found in typical galaxies of similar mass\nand star formation rate at $z\\lesssim$2.5. These young galaxies reveal an early\nand short stage in the assembly of their galactic structures and their chemical\nevolution, a vigorous phase which is likely to be dominated by the effects of\ngas-rich mergers, accretion of metal-poor gas and strong outflows.\n", "  This is a manual for the MOSiC package. MOSiC is a collection of IDL programs\nfor profile analysis and Gaussian fitting of the Mg II h/k lines along with\nGaussian fitting of the C II 133.5 nm line pair, the O I 135.6, the Cl I 135.2,\nthe Si IV 139.7 and 140.3 and the O IV 140.0 nm lines observed with the IRIS\nnear UV and far UV spectrograph. It was tested by analyzing over a hundred\ndifferent IRIS data sets (quiet Sun, sunspot, ...). It works for off limb data,\nalthough it is still experimental. MOSiC analyzes different spectral lines\nseparately and returns line intensity, width, and velocity for each line. A few\nsample profiles and maps are included in this manual.\n", "  We present the deep and wide $V$ and $I_c$ photometry of the Sextans dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy (dSph) taken by Suprime-Cam imager on the Subaru Telescope,\nwhich extends out to the tidal radius. The colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nreaches two magnitudes below the main sequence (MS) turn-off, showing a steep\nred giant branch, blue and red horizontal branch (HB), sub-giant branch (SGB),\nMS, and blue stragglers (BS). We construct the radial profile of each\nevolutionary phase and demonstrate that blue HB stars are more spatially\nextended, while red HB stars are more centrally concentrated than the other\ncomponents. The colour distribution of SGB stars also varies with the\ngalactocentric distance; the inner SGB stars shift bluer than those in the\noutskirt. The radial differences in the CMD morphology indicate the existence\nof the age gradient. The relatively younger stars ($\\sim10$ Gyr) are more\ncentrally concentrated than the older ones ($\\sim13$ Gyr). The spatial contour\nmaps of stars in different age bins also show that the younger population has\nhigher concentration and higher ellipticity than the older one. We also detect\nthe centrally concentrated bright BS stars, the number of which is consistent\nwith the idea that a part of these stars belongs to the remnant of a disrupted\nstar cluster discovered in the previous spectroscopic studies.\n", "  We describe a new method of 3D image reconstruction of neutron sources that\nemit correlated gammas (e.g. Cf-252, Am-Be). This category includes a vast\nmajority of neutron sources important in nuclear threat search, safeguards and\nnon-proliferation. Rather than requiring multiple views of the source this\ntechnique relies on the source's intrinsic property of coincidence gamma and\nneutron emission. As a result only a single-view measurement of the source is\nrequired to perform the 3D reconstruction. In principle, any scatter camera\nsensitive to gammas and neutrons with adequate timing and interaction location\nresolution can perform this reconstruction. Using a neutron double scatter\ntechnique, we can calculate a conical surface of possible source locations. By\nincluding the time to a correlated gamma we further constrain the source\nlocation in three-dimensions by solving for the source-to-detector distance\nalong the surface of said cone. As a proof of concept we applied these\nreconstruction techniques on measurements taken with the the Mobile Imager of\nNeutrons for Emergency Responders (MINER). Two Cf-252 sources measured at 50\nand 60 cm from the center of the detector were resolved in their varying depth\nwith average radial distance relative resolution of 26%. To demonstrate the\ntechnique's potential with an optimized system we simulated the measurement in\nMCNPX-PoliMi assuming timing resolution of 200 ps (from 2 ns in the current\nsystem) and source interaction location resolution of 5 mm (from 3 cm). These\nsimulated improvements in scatter camera performance resulted in radial\ndistance relative resolution decreasing to an average of 11%.\n", "  In physical theories where the energy (action) is localized near a\nsubmanifold of Euclidean (Minkowski) space, there is a universal expression for\nthe energy (or the action). We derive a multipole expansion for the energy that\nhas a finite number of terms, and depends on intrinsic geometric invariants of\nthe submanifold and extrinsic invariants of the embedding of the submanifold.\nThis universal expression is a generalization of an exact formula of Hermann\nWeyl for the volume of a tube. We describe when our result is applicable, when\nour generalization gives an exact result, and when there are corrections (often\nexponentially small) to our formula. In special situations, dictated by\nspherical symmetry, the expression is a generalized Lovelock lagrangian for\ngravity, a class of theories that are interesting because they have no negative\nmetric states. We discuss whether these results represent a true theory of\nemergent gravity by discussing simple models where a higher dimensional quantum\nfield theory without a fundamental graviton leads to a gravity-like theory on a\nsubmanifold where all or some of the dynamical degrees of freedom are\nfluctuations of the metric on the submanifold.\n", "  Subject of this article is the relationship between modern cosmology and\nfundamental physics, in particular general relativity as a theory of gravity on\none side, together with its unique application in cosmology, and the formation\nof structures and their statistics on the other. It summarises arguments for\nthe formulation for a metric theory of gravity and the uniqueness of the\nconstruction of general relativity. It discusses symmetry arguments in the\nconstruction of Friedmann-Lema\\^itre cosmologies as well as assumptions in\nrelation to the presence of dark matter, when adopting general relativity as\nthe gravitational theory. A large section is dedicated to $\\Lambda$CDM as the\nstandard model for structure formation and the arguments that led to its\nconstruction, and to the of role statistics and to the problem of scientific\ninference in cosmology as an empirical science. The article concludes with an\noutlook on current and future developments in cosmology.\n", "  The Doppler effect is a shift in the frequency of waves emitted from an\nobject moving relative to the observer. By observing and analysing the Doppler\nshift in electromagnetic waves from astronomical objects, astronomers gain\ngreater insight into the structure and operation of our universe. In this\npaper, a simple technique is described for teaching the basics of the Doppler\neffect to undergraduate astrophysics students using acoustic waves. An\nadvantage of the technique is that it produces a visual representation of the\nacoustic Doppler shift. The equipment comprises a 40 kHz acoustic transmitter\nand a microphone. The sound is bounced off a computer fan and the signal\ncollected by a DrDAQ ADC and processed by a spectrum analyser. Widening of the\nspectrum is observed as the fan power supply potential is increased from 4 to\n12 V.\n", "  We propose a technique to control the beam direction of a dielectric optical\nmicro-prism structure by properly designing its geometry. We show that by\nselectively choosing the slope of a high index micro prism, the direction of\nthe radiated beam from the tip can be controlled in the broadside direction of\nthe prism structure. We propose an easy fabrication method to integrate such\nbroadside beam routers on a Si platform. We also propose a demonstrate a\ntechnique to build the beam router on an elastic PDMS platform which\ndemonstrates stress induced beam scanning in the broadside This specific\nfeature of beam direction control can find application in free space optical\ninterconnects, plasmonics, solar cells, detectors, optical sensing etc.\n", "  The MicroBooNE Experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, an\n89-ton active mass liquid argon time projection chamber, affords a unique\nopportunity to observe low-$Q^2$ neutral-current neutrino-proton scattering\nevents. Neutral-current neutrino-proton scattering at $Q^2 < 1$ GeV$^2$ is\ndominated by the proton's axial form factor, which can be written as a\ncombination of contributions from the up, down, and strange quarks: $G_A(Q^2) =\n\\frac{1}{2}[-G_A^u(Q^2)+G_A^d(Q^2)+G_A^s(Q^2)]$. The contribution from up and\ndown quarks has been established in past charged-current measurements. The\ncontribution from strange quarks at low $Q^2$ remains unmeasured; this is of\ngreat interest since the strange quark contribution to the proton spin can be\ndetermined from the low-$Q^2$ behavior: $\\Delta S = G_A^s(Q^2=0)$. MicroBooNE\nbegan operating in the Booster Neutrino Beam in October 2015. I will present\nthe status in observing isolated proton tracks in the MicroBooNE detector as a\nsignature for neutral-current neutrino-proton events. The sensitivity of the\nMicroBooNE experiment for measuring the strange quark contribution to the\nproton spin will be discussed.\n", "  The chaotic phenomenon of intermittency is modeled by a simple map of the\nunit interval, the Farey map. The long term dynamical behaviour of a point\nunder iteration of the map is translated into a spin system via symbolic\ndynamics. Methods from dynamical systems theory and statistical mechanics may\nthen be used to analyse the map, respectively the zeta function and the\ntransfer operator. Intermittency is seen to be problematic to analyze due to\nthe presence of an `indifferent fixed point'. Points under iteration of the map\nmove away from this point extremely slowly creating pathological convergence\ntimes for calculations. This difficulty is removed by going to an appropriate\ninduced subsystem, which also leads to an induced zeta function and an induced\ntransfer operator. Results obtained there can be transferred back to the\noriginal system. The main work is then divided into two sections. The first\ndemonstrates a connection between the induced versions of the zeta function and\nthe transfer operator providing useful results regarding the analyticity of the\nzeta function. The second section contains a detailed analysis of the pressure\nfunction for the induced system and hence the original by considering bounds on\nthe radius of convergence of the induced zeta function. In particular, the\nasymptotic behaviour of the pressure function in the limit $\\beta$, the inverse\nof `temperature', tends to negative infinity is determined and the existence\nand nature of a phase transition at $\\beta=1$ is also discussed.\n", "  Transfer of learning is an important objective of education. However,\nstudents usually have difficulties in solving physics transfer tasks even after\nhaving solved similar problems previously. We investigated if instruction\nprovided using videos containing detailed explanations of previously solved\nproblems will improve students' performance in tackling near and far transfer\ntasks. We also investigated whether the combination of visual cues followed by\nvideo solutions yields further enhancement of students' performance. N=33\nstudents in an algebra-based physics class participated in an interview\ncontaining two problem sets each with one initial task, a training session, and\na near and far transfer task. For the training, students either received visual\ncues, visual cues and a video or only videos, depending on the condition. We\ncompare students' correctness rate on near and far transfer tasks in the three\nconditions.\n", "  Dynamics of active or self-propulsive Brownian particles in nonequilibrium\nstatus, has recently attracted great interest in many fields including\nbiological entities and artificial micro/nanoscopic motors6. Understanding of\ntheir dynamics can provide insight into the statistical properties of\nbiological and physical systems far from equilibrium. Generally, active\nBrownian particles can involve either translational or rotational motion. Here,\nwe report the translational dynamics of photon-activated gold nanoparticles\n(NPs) in liquid cell imaged by four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D-EM).\nUnder excitation of femtosecond (fs)-laser pulses, we observed that those\nBrownian NPs exhibit a superfast diffusive behavior with a diffusion constant\nfour to five orders of magnitude greater than that in absence of laser\nexcitation. The measured diffusion constant was found to follow a power-law\ndependence on the fs-laser fluence. Such superfast diffusion is induced by\nstrong random driving forces arising from rapid nucleation, expansion and\ncollapse of photoinduced nanobubbles (NBs) near the NP surface. In contrast,\nthe motion of the NPs exhibit superfast ballistic translation at a short time\nscale down to nanoseconds (ns). Combining with physical model simulation, this\nstudy reveals a NB-propulsion mechanism for the self-propulsive motion,\nproviding physical insights for better design of light-activated artificial\nmicro/nanomotors.\n", "  In the work [Bull, Austr. Math. Soc. 85 (2012), 315-234], S.R. Moghadasi has\nshown how the decomposition of the $N$-fold product of Lebesgue measure on\n$\\mathbb R^n$ implied by matrix polar decomposition can be used to derive the\nBlaschke-Petkantschin decomposition of measure formula from integral geometry.\nWe use known formulas from random matrix theory to give a simplified derivation\nof the decomposition of Lebesgue product measure implied by matrix polar\ndecomposition, applying too to the cases of complex and real quaternion\nentries, and we give corresponding generalisations of the\nBlaschke--Petkantschin formula. A number of applications to random matrix\ntheory and integral geometry are given, including to the calculation of the\nmoments of the volume content of the convex hull of $k \\le N+1$ points in\n$\\mathbb R^N$, $\\mathbb C^N$ or $\\mathbb H^N$ with a Gaussian or uniform\ndistribution.\n", "  The influence of pairing correlations on the neutron root mean square (rms)\nradius of nuclei is investigated in the framework of self-consistent Skyrme\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations. The continuum is treated appropriately by\nthe Green's function techniques. As an example the nucleus $^{124}$Zr is\ntreated for a varying strength of pairing correlations. We find that, as the\npairing strength increases, the neutron rms radius first shrinks, reaches a\nminimum and beyond this point it expands again. The shrinkage is due to the the\nso-called `pairing anti-halo effect', i. e. due to the decreasing of the\nasymptotic density distribution with increasing pairing. However, in some\ncases, increasing pairing correlations can also lead to an expansion of the\nnucleus due to a growing occupation of so-called `halo' orbits, i.e. weakly\nbound states and resonances in the continuum with low-$\\ell $ values. In this\ncase, the neutron radii are extended just by the influence of pairing\ncorrelations, since these `halo' orbits cannot be occupied without pairing. The\nterm `anti-halo effect' is not justified in such cases. For a full\nunderstanding of this complicated interplay self-consistent calculations are\nnecessary.\n", "  Genuine steering is still not well understood enough in contrast to genuine\nentanglement and nonlocality. Here we provide a protocol which can reveal\ngenuine steering under some restricted operations compared to the existing\nwitnesses of genuine multipartite steering. Our method has an impression of\nsome sort of hidden protocol in the same spirit of hidden nonlocality, which is\nwell understood in bipartite scenario. We also introduce a genuine steering\nmeasure which indicates the enhancement of genuine steering in the final state\nof our protocol compared to the initial states.\n", "  Prompted by recent reports on $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ graphene\nsuperlattices with intrinsic inter-valley interactions, we perform\nfirst-principles calculations to investigate the electronic properties of\nperiodically nitrogen-doped graphene and carbon nanotube nanostructures. In\nthese structures, nitrogen atoms substitute one-sixth of the carbon atoms in\nthe pristine hexagonal lattices with exact periodicity to form perfect\n$\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ superlattices of graphene and carbon nanotubes.\nMultiple nanostructures of $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ graphene ribbons and\ncarbon nanotubes are explored, and all configurations show nonmagnetic and\nmetallic behaviors. The transport properties of $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$\ngraphene and carbon nanotube superlattices are calculated utilizing the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism combined with density functional\ntheory. The transmission spectrum through the pristine and $\\sqrt{3} \\times\n\\sqrt{3}$ armchair carbon nanotube heterostructure shows quantized behavior\nunder certain circumstances.\n", "  X-ray polarimetry has seen a growing interest in recent years. Improvements\nin detector technology and focusing X-ray optics now enable sensitive\nastrophysical X-ray polarization measurements. These measurements will provide\nnew insights into the processes at work in accreting black holes, the emission\nof X-rays from neutron stars and magnetars, and the structure of AGN jets.\nX-Calibur is a balloon-borne hard X-ray scattering polarimeter. An X-ray mirror\nwith a focal length of 8 m focuses X-rays onto the detector, which consists of\na plastic scattering element surrounded by Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride detectors,\nwhich absorb and record the scattered X-rays. Since X-rays preferentially\nscatter perpendicular to their polarization direction, the polarization\nproperties of an X-ray beam can be inferred from the azimuthal distribution of\nscattered X-rays. A close alignment of the X-ray focal spot with the center of\nthe detector is required in order to reduce systematic uncertainties and to\nmaintain a high photon detection efficiency. This places stringent requirements\non the mechanical and thermal stability of the telescope structure. During the\nflight on a stratospheric balloon, X-Calibur makes use of the Wallops\nArc-Second Pointer (WASP) to point the telescope at astrophysical sources. In\nthis paper, we describe the design, construction, and test of the telescope\nstructure, as well as its performance during a 25-hour flight from Ft. Sumner,\nNew Mexico. The carbon fiber-aluminum composite structure met the requirements\nset by X-Calibur and its design can easily be adapted for other types of\nexperiments, such as X-ray imaging or spectroscopic telescopes.\n", "  We consider longitudinal nonlinear atomic vibrations in uniformly strained\ncarbon chains with the cumulene structure ($=C=C=)_{n}$. With the aid of ab\ninitio simulations, based on the density functional theory, we have revealed\nthe phenomenon of the $\\pi$-mode softening in a certain range of its amplitude\nfor the strain above the critical value $\\eta_{c}\\approx 11\\,{\\%}$.\nCondensation of this soft mode induces the structural transformation of the\ncarbon chain with doubling of its unit cell. This is the Peierls phase\ntransition in the strained cumulene, which was previously revealed in [Nano\nLett. 14, 4224 (2014)]. The Peierls transition leads to appearance of the\nenergy gap in the electron spectrum of the strained carbyne, and this material\ntransforms from the conducting state to semiconducting or insulating states.\nThe authors of the above paper emphasize that such phenomenon can be used for\nconstruction of various nanodevices. The $\\pi$-mode softening occurs because\nthe old equilibrium positions (EQPs), around which carbon atoms vibrate at\nsmall strains, lose their stability and these atoms begin to vibrate in the new\npotential wells located near old EQPs. We study the stability of the new EQPs,\nas well as stability of vibrations in their vicinity. In previous paper\n[Physica D 203, 121(2005)], we proved that only three symmetry-determined\nRosenberg nonlinear normal modes can exist in monoatomic chains with arbitrary\ninterparticle interactions. They are the above-discussed $\\pi$-mode and two\nother modes, which we call $\\sigma$-mode and $\\tau$-mode. These modes\ncorrespond to the multiplication of the unit cell of the vibrational state by\ntwo, three or four times compared to that of the equilibrium state. We study\nproperties of these modes in the chain model with arbitrary pair potential of\ninterparticle interactions.\n", "  We illustrate a rigorous approach to express the totally symmetric isotropic\ntensors of arbitrary rank in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space as a linear\ncombination of products of Kronecker deltas. By making full use of the\nsymmetries, one can greatly reduce the efforts to compute cumbersome angular\nintegrals into straightforward combinatoric counts. This method is generalized\ninto the cases in which such symmetries are present in subspaces. We further\ndemonstrate the mechanism of the tensor-integral reduction that is widely used\nin various physics problems such as perturbative calculations of the\ngauge-field theory in which divergent integrals are regularized in\n$d=4-2\\epsilon$ space-time dimensions. The main derivation is given in the\n$n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The generalization of the result to the\nMinkowski space is also discussed in order to provide graduate students and\nresearchers with techniques of tensor-integral reduction for particle physics\nproblems.\n", "  The transient electroosmotic flow of Maxwell fluid in a rotating microchannel\nis investigated both analytically and numerically. We bring out the complex\ndynamics of the flow during the transience due to the combination of rotation\nand rheological effects. We show the regimes of operation under which our\nanalysis holds the most significance. We also shed some light on the volumetric\nflow rate characteristics as dictated by the underlying flow physics.\nAnalytical solution compares well with the numerical solution. We believe that\nthe results from the present study could potentially have far reaching\napplications in bio-fluidic microsystems where fluids such as blood, mucus and\nsaliva may be involved.\n", "  Wavefunctions restricted to electron-pair states are promising models to\ndescribe static/nondynamic electron correlation effects encountered, for\ninstance, in bond-dissociation processes and transition-metal and actinide\nchemistry. To reach spectroscopic accuracy, however, the missing dynamic\nelectron correlation effects that cannot be described by electron-pair states\nneed to be included \\textit{a posteriori}. In this article, we extend the\npreviously presented perturbation theory models with an Antisymmetric Product\nof 1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) reference function that allow us to\ndescribe both static/nondynamic and dynamic electron correlation effects.\nSpecifically, our perturbation theory models combine a diagonal and\noff-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian, a single-reference and multi-reference\ndual state, and different excitation operators used to construct the projection\nmanifold. We benchmark all proposed models as well as an \\textit{a posteriori}\nlinearized coupled cluster correction on top of AP1roG against CR-CCSD(T)\nreference data for reaction energies of several closed-shell molecules that are\nextrapolated to the basis set limit. Moreover, we test the performance of our\nnew methods for multiple bond breaking processes in the N$_2$, C$_2$, and BN\ndimers against MRCI-SD and MRCI-SD+Q reference data. Our numerical results\nindicate that the best performance is obtained from a linearized coupled\ncluster correction as well as second-order perturbation theory corrections\nemploying a diagonal and off-diagonal zero-order Hamiltonian and a\nsingle-determinant dual state. These dynamic corrections on top of AP1roG allow\nus to reliably model molecular systems dominated by static/nondynamic as well\nas dynamic electron correlation.\n", "  The effect of turbulence on the mass and heat transfer between small heavy\ninertial particles (HIP) and an embedding fluid is studied. Two effects are\nidentified. The first effect is due to the relative velocity between the fluid\nand the particles, and a model for the relative velocity is presented. The\nsecond effect is due to the clustering of particles, where the mass transfer\nrate is inhibited due to the rapid depletion of the consumed species inside the\ndense particle clusters. This last effect is relevant for large Damkohler\nnumbers and it may totally control the mass transfer rate for Damkohler numbers\nlarger than unity. A model that describes how this effect should be\nincorporated into existing particle simulation tools is presented.\n", "  We assume that the Higgs doublet has a composite structure, respecting the\nmain standard model properties, and therefore called Composite Standard Model\n(CSM), but leading (through Goldstone equivalence) to $Z_L$ and $W_L$ form\nfactors. We illustrate how such a form factor affecting the $ZZ_LH$ coupling\nwill be directly observable in $e^+e^-\\to ZH$. We then show the spectacular\nconsequences which would appear in the inclusive processes $e^+e^-\\to\nZ_L+anything $. Such a form factor could also affect the $\\gamma W^+_LW^-_L$\nand $Z W^+_LW^-_L$ vertices and we show what effects this would generate in\n$e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ (especially in $e^+e^-_R\\to W^+_LW^-_L$) and in $e^+e^-\\to\nW_L+anything $. We finally mention the $\\gamma\\gamma\\to W^+W^-$ process and\nseveral other processes in hadronic collisions which could be similarly\naffected.\n", "  Studies of ultra-fast laser-matter interaction are important for many\napplications. Such interaction triggers extreme physical processes which are\nlocalized in the range from $\\sim 10$ nanometers to micron spatial scales and\ndeveloping within picosecond$-$nanosecond time range. Thus the experimental\nobservations are difficult and methods of applied mathematics are necessary to\nunderstand these processes. Here we describe our simulation approaches and\npresent solutions for a laser problem significant for applications. Namely, the\nprocesses of melting, a liquid jet formation, and its rupture are considered.\nMotion with the jet is caused by a short $\\sim 0.1-1$ ps pulse illuminating a\nsmall spot on a surface of a thin $\\sim 10-100$ nm film deposited onto\nsubstrate.\n", "  Optimizing a connection through a quantum repeater network requires careful\nattention to the photon propagation direction of the individual links, the\narrangement of those links into a path, the error management mechanism chosen,\nand the application's pattern of consuming the Bell pairs generated. We analyze\ncombinations of these parameters, concentrating on one-way error correction\nschemes (1-EPP) and high success probability links (those averaging enough\nentanglement successes per round trip time interval to satisfy the error\ncorrection system). We divide the buffering time (defined as minimizing the\ntime during which qubits are stored without being usable) into the link-level\nand path-level waits. With three basic link timing patterns, a path timing\npattern with zero unnecessary path buffering exists for all $3^h$ combinations\nof $h$ hops, for Bell inequality violation experiments (B class) and Clifford\ngroup (C class) computations, but not for full teleportation (T class)\ncomputations. On most paths, T class computations have a range of Pareto\noptimal timing patterns with a non-zero amount of path buffering. They can have\noptimal zero path buffering only on a chain of links where the photonic quantum\nstates propagate counter to the direction of teleportation. Such a path reduces\nthe time that a quantum state must be stored by a factor of two compared to\nPareto optimal timing on some other possible paths.\n", "  A variable-coefficient forced Korteweg-de Vries equation with spacial\ninhomogeneity is investigated in this paper. Under constraints, this equation\nis transformed into its bilinear form, and multi-soliton solutions are derived.\nEffects of spacial inhomogeneity for soliton velocity, width and background are\ndiscussed. Nonlinear tunneling for this equation is presented, where the\nsoliton amplitude can be amplified or compressed. Our results might be useful\nfor the relevant problems in fluids and plasmas.\n", "  In order to provide a better basis for the study of mechanisms of\nnucleosynthesis of the light elements beyond hydrogen and helium in the oldest\nstars, the abundances of C, O, Mg, Si, P, S, K, and Ca have been derived from\nUV-HST and visible-ESO high resolution spectra in the old, very metal-poor star\nHD 84937, at a metallicity that is 1/200 that of the Sun's. For this halo\nmain-sequence turnoff star, the abundance determination of P and S are the\nfirst published determinations. The LTE profiles of the lines were fitted to\nthe observed spectra. Wherever possible, we corrected the derived abundances\nfor non-LTE effects. Three-dimensional (3D) CO5BOLD model atmospheres have been\nused to determine the abundances of C and O from molecular CH and OH bands. The\nabundances of these light elements in HD 84937 are found to agree well with the\nabundances in classical metal-poor stars. Our HD 84937 carbon abundance\ndetermination points toward a solar (or mildly enhanced) value of [C/Fe]. The\nmodest overabundance of the alpha elements of even atomic number Z, typical of\nhalo turnoff stars, is confirmed in this example. The odd-Z element P is found\nto be somewhat deficient in HD 84937, at [P/Fe]=-0.32, which is again\nconsistent with the handful of existing determinations for turnoff stars of\nsuch low metallicity. We show that the abundance of oxygen, deduced from the OH\nband from 3D computations, is not compatible with the abundance deduced from\nthe red oxygen triplet. This incompatibility is explained by the existence of a\nchromosphere heating the shallow layers of the atmosphere where the OH band, in\n3D computations, is mainly formed. The abundance ratios are compared to the\npredictions of models of galactic nucleosynthesis and evolution\n", "  Cosmic ray muons with the average energy of 280 GeV and neutrons produced by\nmuons are detected with the Large Volume Detector at LNGS. We present an\nanalysis of the seasonal variation of the neutron flux on the basis of the data\nobtained during 15 years. The measurement of the seasonal variation of the\nspecific number of neutrons generated by muons allows to obtaine the variation\nmagnitude of of the average energy of the muon flux at the depth of the LVD\nlocation. The source of the seasonal variation of the total neutron flux is a\nchange of the intensity and the average energy of the muon flux.\n", "  We report on an original and simple formulation of the phase shift in\nN-light-pulse atom interferometers. We consider atomic interferometers based on\ntwo-photon transitions (Raman transitions or Bragg pulses). Starting from the\nexact analytical phase shift formula obtained from the atom optics ABCD\nformalism, we use a power series expansion in time of the position of the\natomic wave packet with respect to the initial condition. The result of this\nexpansion leads to a formulation of the interferometer phase shift where the\nleading coefficient in the phase terms up to T^k dependences (k >= 0) in the\ntime separation T between pulses, can be simply expressed in terms of a product\nbetween a Vandermonde matrix, and a vector characterizing the two-photon pulse\nsequence of the interferometer. This simple coefficient dependence of the phase\nshift reflects very well the atom interferometer's sensitivity to a specific\ninertial field in the presence of multiple gravito-inertial effects.\nConsequently,we show that this formulation is well suited when looking for\nselective atomic sensors of accelerations, rotations, or photon recoil only,\nwhich can be obtained by simply zeroing some specific coefficients. We give a\ntheoritical application of our formulation to the photon recoil measurement.\n", "  Saint-Venant equations can be generalized to account for a viscoelastic\nrheology in shallow flows. A Finite-Volume discretization for the 1D\nSaint-Venant system generalized to Upper-Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluids was\nproposed in [Bouchut \\& Boyaval, 2013], which preserved a physically-natural\nstability property (i.e. free-energy dissipation) of the full system. It\ninvoked a relaxation scheme of Suliciu type for the numerical computation of\napproximate solution to Riemann problems. Here, the approach is extended to the\n1D Saint-Venant system generalized to the finitely-extensible nonlinear elastic\nfluids of Peterlin (FENE-P). We are currently not able to ensure all stability\nconditions a priori, but numerical simulations went smoothly in a practically\nuseful range of parameters.\n", "  It is often claimed that error cancellation plays an essential role in\nquantum chemistry and first-principle simulation for condensed matter physics\nand materials science. Indeed, while the energy of a large, or even\nmedium-size, molecular system cannot be estimated numerically within chemical\naccuracy (typically 1 kcal/mol or 1 mHa), it is considered that the energy\ndifference between two configurations of the same system can be computed in\npractice within the desired accuracy.\n  The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative study of\ndiscretization error cancellation. The latter is the error component due to the\nfact that the model used in the calculation (e.g. Kohn-Sham LDA) must be\ndiscretized in a finite basis set to be solved by a computer. We first report\ncomprehensive numerical simulations performed with Abinit on two simple\nchemical systems, the hydrogen molecule on the one hand, and a system\nconsisting of two oxygen atoms and four hydrogen atoms on the other hand. We\nobserve that errors on energy differences are indeed significantly smaller than\nerrors on energies, but that these two quantities asymptotically converge at\nthe same rate when the energy cut-off goes to infinity. We then analyze a\nsimple one-dimensional periodic Schr\\\"odinger equation with Dirac potentials,\nfor which analytic solutions are available. This allows us to explain the\ndiscretization error cancellation phenomenon on this test case with\nquantitative mathematical arguments.\n", "  The linear susceptibility of an atomic sample is formally equivalent to the\nresponse of a RLC circuit. We use a ladder of lumped RLC circuits to observe an\nanalogue of slow-light, a well-known phenomenon in atomic physics. We first\ncharacterize the radio-frequency response of the circuit in the spectral domain\nexhibiting a transparency window surrounded by two strongly absorptive lines.\nWe then observe a delayed pulse whose group delay is comparable to the pulse\nduration corresponding to slow-light propagation. The large group delay is\nobtained by cascading in a ladder configuration doubly resonant RLC cells.\n", "  In this letter we study some relevant physical parameters of the massless\nGross-Neveu model in a finite spatial dimension for different boundary\nconditions. It is considered the standard homogeneous Hartree Fock solution\nusing zeta function regularization for the study the mass dynamically generated\nand its respective beta function. It is found that the beta function does not\ndepend on the Boundary conditions. On the other hand, it was considered the\nCasimir effect of the resulting effective theory. There appears a complex\npicture where the sign of the generated forces depends on the parameters used\nin the study.\n", "  In the extended phase space, a general method is used to derive all the\npossible adiabatic processes for charged AdS black hole. Two kinds are found,\none is zero temperature adiabatic process which is irreversible, the other is\nisochore adiabatic process which is reversible. For the zero temperature\nadiabatic expansion process, entropy is increasing; pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs\nfree energy and internal energy are decreasing; system's potential energy is\ntransformed to the work done by the system to the outer system. For the\nisochore adiabatic process, entropy and internal energy are fixed; temperature,\nenthalpy and Gibbs free energy are proportional to pressure; during the\npressure increasing process, temperature is increasing and system's potential\nenergy is transformed to its kinetic energy. Comparing these two adiabatic\nprocesses with those in normal thermodynamic system, we find that the zero\ntemperature adiabatic process is much like the adiabatic throttling\nprocess(both are irreversible and with work done), the isochore adiabatic\nprocess is much like a combination of the reversible adiabatic process (both\nwith fixed entropy) and the adiabatic free expansion process (both with fixed\ninternal energy).\n", "  In this contribution we revisit simulations of two-color QCD with rooted\nstaggered quarks at finite density, where baryon-number spontaneously breaks\nand a diquark condensate forms. We thereby pay special attention to simulating\noutside the lattice-artifact bulk phase, in which $Z_2$ monopoles condense, and\ninvestigate some of the consequences of this, e.g. on the chiral and the\ndiquark condensate which were known to be well described by chiral effective\nfield theory. Not surprisingly, on finer lattices outside the bulk phase the\nquark condensate now requires additive renormalization before it can be\ncompared with effective field theory predictions. The subtraction must\nnecessarily depend on the chemical potential, however. The diquark condensate\nis not affected by this problem and remains in good agreement with these\npredictions. We also compare staggered with Wilson quarks to demonstrate that\nthe two fermion discretizations yield qualitatively different results well\nbelow half-filling already. We close with prelimiary results for the Goldstone\nspectrum to demonstrate that the continuum pattern is recovered also with\nstaggered quarks outside the bulk phase.\n", "  A new convenient method to diagonalize the non-relativistic many-body\nSchroedinger equation with two-body central potentials is derived. It combines\nkinematic rotations (democracy transformations) and exact calculation of\noverlap integrals between bases with different sets of mass-scaled Jacobi\ncoordinates, thereby allowing for a great simplification of this formidable\nproblem. We validate our method by obtaining a perfect correspondence with the\nexactly solvable three-body ($N=3$) Calogero model in 1D.\n", "  Merger trees track the evolution of halos across multiple snapshots. They\nassign for halos of a particular snapshot, the set of halos from previous\nsnapshots they possibly originated from. In this work, Association rule\nanalysis a well known technique from data mining has been used to build halo\nmerger trees. Association rule analysis tries to find associations between\ndifferent halos(in same as well as in snapshots) using the particle IDs of the\nparticles which the halos are made of. Associations are expressed in the form\nof association rules. Merger trees are one of the several useful results one\ncan obtain from the output of association rule analysis. Other results\nincluding halo substructure and halo splitting can also be extracted. Each type\nof output to be extracted from the association rule analysis output correspond\nto a pattern in association rules. Merger trees were formed and tested using\nthe above technique. Dark matter simulations were run using Gadget-2 for 128^3\nparticles. Halos were extracted from the simulation snapshots using Amiga Halo\nFinder. Halo accretion history was plotted and compared against those formed\nusing AHF merger tree builder.\n", "  Temperature, magnetic induction and substitution dependent resistivity are a\ncrucial factor in determining the physical properties of magneto-resistive\nmaterials. The first objective of this work was to find out an applicable\nmethod of using temperature to predict the resistivity of\nPr0.7(CaxSr1-x)0.3MnO3 in the metal phase within the transition area. Based on\nnon-linear curve fitting, a typical numerical method is used to quantitatively\nanalyze the temperature-dependent resistivity within temperatures lower than\nthe metal-insulator transition temperature (Tp). The simulations agree very\nwell with the observed curves (resistivity versus temperature). The second\nobjective of this work is to search for the applicable method to link\nmagneto-resistivity to magnetic induction, calculation on the principle of\nnon-linear curve fitting, four typical numerical methods are highlighted\nbecause the magnetic induction-dependent magneto-resistivity are quantitatively\nanalyzed by these methods. The observed effects of magnetic induction on the\nshift of temperature-resistive curve should be more essential in physics and\nare quantitatively discussed in magneto-resistive materials. Lastly, the\ninfluences of Ca substitution on magneto-resistivity are detected.\n", "  The primary aim of this chapter is, commemorating the 150th anniversary of\nRiemann's death, to explain how the idea of {\\it Riemann sum} is linked to\nother branches of mathematics. The materials I treat are more or less classical\nand elementary, thus available to the \"common mathematician in the streets.\"\nHowever one may still see here interesting inter-connection and cohesiveness in\nmathematics.\n", "  Dawn-dusk asymmetries are ubiquitous features of the coupled\nsolar-wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. During the last decades, increasing\navailability of satellite and ground-based measurements has made it possible to\nstudy these phenomena in more detail. Numerous publications have documented the\nexistence of persistent asymmetries in processes, properties and topology of\nplasma structures in various regions of geospace. In this paper, we present a\nreview of our present knowledge of some of the most pronounced dawn-dusk\nasymmetries. We focus on four key aspects: (1) the role of external influences\nsuch as the solar wind and its interaction with the Earth's magnetosphere; (2)\nproperties of the magnetosphere itself; (3) the role of the ionosphere and (4)\nfeedback and coupling between regions. We have also identified potential\ninconsistencies and gaps in our understanding of dawn-dusk asymmetries in the\nEarth's magnetosphere and ionosphere.\n", "  The MEPED instruments on board the NOAA POES andMetOp satellites have been\ncontinuously measuring energetic particles in the magnetosphere since 1978.\nHowever, degradation of the proton detectors over time leads to an increase in\nthe energy thresholds of the instrument and imposes great challenges to studies\nof long-term variability in the near-Earth space environment as well as a\ngeneral quantification of the proton fluxes. By comparing monthly mean\naccumulated integral flux from a new and an old satellite at the same magnetic\nlocal time (MLT) and time period, we estimate the change in energy thresholds.\nThe first 12 monthly energy spectra of the new satellite are used as a\nreference, and the derived monthly correction factors over a year for an old\nsatellite show a small spread, indicating a robust calibration procedure. The\nmethod enables us to determine for the first time the correction factors also\nfor the highest-energy channels of the proton detector. In addition, we make\nuse of the newest satellite in orbit (MetOp-01) to find correction factors for\n2013 for the NOAA 17 and MetOp-02 satellites. Without taking into account the\nlevel of degradation, the proton data from one satellite cannot be used\nquantitatively for more than 2 to 3 years after launch. As the electron\ndetectors are vulnerable to contamination from energetic protons, the corrected\nproton measurements will be of value for electron flux measurements too. Thus,\nthe correction factors ensure the correctness of both the proton and electron\nmeasurements.\n", "  The work is devoted to the study of the correlation technique of formation of\nlaser beams under conditions of the interaction of coherent fields spatially\nperiodic in the transverse direction.\\,\\,It is aimed at the application of this\ntechnique to the multiplexing (splitting) of an input laser beam to several\noutput ones, management of the energy of these beams, and their clustering and\ndebunching according to required time algorithms.\n", "  The characteristics of the gravitational collapse of a supernova and the\nfluxes of active and sterile neutrinos produced during the formation of its\nprotoneutron core have been calculated numerically. The relative yields of\nactive and sterile neutrinos in core matter with different degrees of\nneutronization have been calculated for various input parameters and various\ninitial conditions. A significant increase in the fraction of sterile neutrinos\nproduced in superdense core matter at the resonant degree of neutronization has\nbeen confirmed. The contributions of sterile neutrinos to the collapse dynamics\nand the total flux of neutrinos produced during collapse have been shown to be\nrelatively small. The total luminosity of sterile neutrinos is considerably\nlower than the luminosity of electron neutrinos, but their spectrum is\nconsiderably harder at high energies.\n", "  Electric currents flowing through near-Earth space ($\\textit{R}$ $\\leq$12\n$\\mathit{R}_{E}$) can support a highly distorted magnetic field topology,\nchanging particle drift paths and therefore having a nonlinear feedback on the\ncurrents themselves. A number of current systems exist in the magnetosphere,\nmost commonly defined as (1) the dayside magnetopause Chapman-Ferraro currents,\n(2) the Birkeland field-aligned currents with high latitude \"region 1\" and\nlower-latitude \"region 2\" currents connected to the partial ring current, (3)\nthe magnetotail currents, and (4) the symmetric ring current. In the near-Earth\nnightside region, however, several of these current systems flow in close\nproximity to each other. Moreover, the existence of other temporal current\nsystems, such as the substorm current wedge or \"banana\" current, has been\nreported. It is very difficult to identify a local measurement as belonging to\na specific system. Such identification is important, however, because how the\ncurrent closes and how these loops change in space and time governs the\nmagnetic topology of the magnetosphere and therefore controls the physical\nprocesses of geospace. Furthermore, many methods exist for identifying the\nregions of near-Earth space carrying each type of current. This study presents\na robust collection of these definitions of current systems in geospace,\nparticularly in the near-Earth nightside magnetosphere, as viewed from a\nvariety of observational and computational analysis techniques. The influence\nof definitional choice on the resulting interpretation of physical processes\ngoverning geospace dynamics is presented and discussed.\n", "  We study the significance of mergers in the quenching of star formation in\ngalaxies at z~1 by examining their color-mass distributions for different\nmorphology types. We perform two-dimensional light profile fits to GOODS iz\nimages of ~5000 galaxies and X-ray selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts\nin the CANDELS/GOODS-north and south fields in the redshift range 0.7<z<1.3.\nDistinguishing between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated morphologies, we find\nthat disks and spheroids have distinct color-mass distributions, in agreement\nwith studies at z~0. The smooth distribution across colors for the disk\ngalaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event.\nMeanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming\ndisk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is\nsuggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray\nAGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and\ndistributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on\nEddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN\nin the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the\nAGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves\ninto the green valley. This suggests AGN feedback may play a role in the\nquenching of star formation in the minority of galaxies that undergo major\nmergers.\n", "  We analyse archival CGRO-BATSE X-ray flux and spin frequency measurements of\nGX 1+4 over a time span of 3000 days. We systematically search for time\ndependent variations of torque luminosity correlation. Our preliminary results\nindicate that the correlation shifts from being positive to negative on time\nscales of few 100 days.\n", "  Power spectra of segmentation-cell length (a dominant length scale of EUV\nemission in the transition region) from full-disk HeII extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV) images observed by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT)\nonboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during\nperiods of quiet Sun conditions for a time interval from 1996 to 2015 were\nanalyzed. The spatial power as a function of the spatial frequency from about\n0.04 to 0.27 (EIT) or up to 0.48 (AIA) 1/Mm depends on the distribution of the\nobserved segmentation-cell dimensions, -- a structure of the solar EUV network.\nThe temporal variations of the spatial power reported by Didkovsky and Gurman\n(Solar Phys., 289, 153) were suggested as decreases at the mid-spatial\nfrequencies for the compared spectra when the power curves at the highest\nspatial frequencies of 0.5 1/pix were adjusted to match each other. That\napproach has been extended in this work to compare spectral ratios at high\nspatial frequencies expressed in the solar spatial frequency units of 1/Mm.\nBased on this approach we represent these ratio changes as a long-term network\ntransformation which may be interpreted as a continuous dissipation of mid-size\nnetwork structures to the smaller-size structures in the transition region. In\ncontrast to expected cycling of the segmentation-cell dimension structures and\nassociated spatial power in the spectra with the solar cycle, the spectra\ndemonstrate a significant and steady change of the EUV network. The temporal\ntrend across these structural spectra is not critically sensitive to any\nlong-term instrumental changes, e.g. degradation of sensitivity, but to the\nchange of the segmentation-cell dimensions of the EUV network structure.\n", "  We review some recent methods of subgrid-scale parameterization used in the\ncontext of climate modeling. These methods are developed to take into account\n(subgrid) processes playing an important role in the correct representation of\nthe atmospheric and climate variability. We illustrate these methods on a\nsimple stochastic triad system relevant for the atmospheric and climate\ndynamics, and we show in particular that the stability properties of the\nunderlying dynamics of the subgrid processes has a considerable impact on their\nperformances.\n", "  The very humble origins of the Cyberspace, and all the related developments\nthat smoothly conspired and converged towards this concept, making its\nemergence possible, as the personal computer, TEX and LATEX, the Fax, the\ninternet, the cellphone, and the World Wide Web, are discussed, always from a\npersonal perspective. A separate, comprehensive explanation of the reasons for\nthe appearance and subsequent evolution of each of these different phenomena,\nwith explicit assessments and a future prospective of the main subject, is\npresented.\n", "  A Chern-Simons theory in 3D is accomplished by the so-called $\\theta$-term in\nthe action, $(\\theta/2)\\int F\\wedge F$, which contributes only to observable\neffects on the boundaries of such a system. When electromagnetic radiation\ninteracts with the system, the wave is reflected and its polarization is\nrotated at the interface, even when both the $\\theta$-system and the\nenvironment are pure vacuum. These topics have been studied extensively. Here,\nwe investigate the optical properties of a thin $\\theta$-film, where multiple\ninternal reflections could interfere coherently. The cases of pure vacuum and a\nmaterial with magneto-electric properties are analyzed. It is found that the\nfilm reflectance is enhanced compared to ordinary non-$\\theta$ systems and the\ninterplay between magneto-electric properties and $\\theta$ parameter yield film\nopacity and polarization properties which could be interesting in the case of\ntopological insulators, among other topological systems.\n", "  We study the dynamics of evolution of points of agents placed in the vertices\nof a graph within the rules of two-agent units of competition where an edge is\nrandomly chosen and the agent with higher points gets a new point with a\nprobability $p$. The model is closely connected to generalized vertex models\nand anti-ferromagnetic Potts models at zero temperature. After studying the\nmost general properties for generic graphs we confine the study to discrete\nd-dimensional tori. We mainly focus on the ring and torus graphs.\n", "  The aim of this work is to study, from an intrinsic and geometric point of\nview, second-order constrained variational problems on Lie algebroids, that is,\noptimization problems defined by a cost functional which depends on\nhigher-order derivatives of admissible curves on a Lie algebroid. Extending the\nclassical Skinner and Rusk formalism for the mechanics in the context of Lie\nalgebroids, for second-order constrained mechanical systems, we derive the\ncorresponding dynamical equations. We find a symplectic Lie subalgebroid where,\nunder some mild regularity conditions, the second-order constrained variational\nproblem, seen as a presymplectic Hamiltonian system, has a unique solution. We\nstudy the relationship of this formalism with the second-order constrained\nEuler-Poincar\\'e and Lagrange-Poincar\\'e equations, among others. Our study is\napplied to the optimal control of mechanical systems.\n", "  The brain is a paradigmatic example of a complex system as its functionality\nemerges as a global property of local mesoscopic and microscopic interactions.\nComplex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the\nbrain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and\nto extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans during the\nresting condition for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional\nbrain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by\nforming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered\nanatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of\nthe occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form\na closed core. We also report the hierarchy of network segregation and the\nlevel of clusters integration as a function of the connectivity strength\nbetween brain regions.\n", "  A promising approach of designing mesostructured materials with novel\nphysical behavior is to combine unique optical and electronic properties of\nsolid nanoparticles with long-range ordering and facile response of soft matter\nto weak external stimuli. Here we design, practically realize, and characterize\norientationally ordered nematic liquid crystalline dispersions of rod-like\nupconversion nanoparticles. Boundary conditions on particle surfaces, defined\nthrough surface functionalization, promote spontaneous unidirectional\nself-alignment of the dispersed rod-like nanoparticles, mechanically coupled to\nthe molecular ordering direction of the thermotropic nematic liquid crystal\nhost. As host is electrically switched at low voltages~ 1V, nanorods rotate,\nyielding tunable upconversion and polarized luminescence properties of the\ncomposite. We characterize spectral and polarization dependencies, explain them\nthrough invoking models of electrical switching and upconversion dependence on\ncrystalline matrices of nanorods, and discuss potential practical uses.\n", "  On an asymptotically flat manifold $M^n$ with nonnegative scalar curvature,\nwith outer minimizing boundary $\\Sigma$, we prove a Penrose-like inequality in\ndimensions $ n < 8$, under suitable assumptions on the mean curvature and the\nscalar curvature of $ \\Sigma$.\n", "  A method for measuring the real part of the weak (local) value of spin is\npresented using a variant on the original Stern-Gerlach apparatus. The\nexperiment utilises metastable helium in the $\\rm 2^{3}S_{1}$ state. A full\nsimulation using the impulsive approximation has been carried out and it\npredicts a displacement of the beam by $\\rm \\Delta_{w} = 17 - 33\\,\\mu m$. This\nis on the limit of our detector resolution and we will discuss ways of\nincreasing $\\rm \\Delta_{w}$. The simulation also indicates how we might observe\nthe imaginary part of the weak value.\n", "  Electric-field noise from the surfaces of ion-trap electrodes couples to the\nion's charge causing heating of the ion's motional modes. This heating limits\nthe fidelity of quantum gates implemented in quantum information processing\nexperiments. The exact mechanism that gives rise to electric-field noise from\nsurfaces is not well-understood and remains an active area of research. In this\nwork, we detail experiments intended to measure ion motional heating rates with\nexchangeable surfaces positioned in close proximity to the ion, as a sensor to\nelectric-field noise. We have prepared samples with various surface conditions,\ncharacterized in situ with scanned probe microscopy and electron spectroscopy,\nranging in degrees of cleanliness and structural order. The heating-rate data,\nhowever, show no significant differences between the disparate surfaces that\nwere probed. These results suggest that the driving mechanism for\nelectric-field noise from surfaces is due to more than just thermal excitations\nalone.\n", "  We have studied the long-term X-ray light curve (2$-$10 keV) of the luminous\nSeyfert 1 galaxy MCG-2-58-22 by compiling data, from various X-ray satellites,\nwhich together cover more than 20 years. We have found two distinct types of\ntime variations in the light curve. One is a gradual and secular decrease of\nthe X-ray flux, and the other is the episodic increase of X-ray flux (or flare)\nby a factor of 2$-$4 compared with the level expected from the secular\nvariation. We detected 3 such flares in total; a representative duration for\nthe flares is $\\sim $2 years, with intervening quiescent intervals lasting\n$\\sim 6-8$ years. We discuss a few possible origins for these variabilities.\nThough a standard disk instability theory may explain the displayed time\nvariability in the X-ray light curve, the subsequent accretions of stellar\ndebris, from a tidal disruption event caused by a supermassive black hole in\nMCG-2-58-22, cannot be ruled out as an alternative explanation.\n", "  Gaudi, Naber & Sackett pointed out that if an event is caused by a lens\nsystem containing more than two planets, all planets will affect the central\nregion of the magnification pattern, and thus the existence of the multiple\nplanets can be inferred by detecting additionally deformed anomalies from\nintensive monitoring of high magnification events. Unfortunately, this method\nhas important limitations in identifying the existence of multiple planets and\ndetermining their parameters due to the degeneracy of the resulting light curve\nanomalies from those induced by a single planet and the complexity of multiple\nplanet lensing models. In this paper, we propose a new channel to search for\nmultiple planets via microlensing. The method is based on the fact that the\nanomalies induced by multiple planets are well approximated by the\nsuperposition of those of the single planet systems where the individual\nplanet-primary pairs act as independent lens systems. Then, if the source\ntrajectory passes both of the outer deviation regions induced by the individual\nplanets, one can unambiguously identify the existence of the multiple planets.\nWe illustrate that the probability of successively detecting light curve\nanomalies induced by two Jovian-mass planets located in the lensing zone\nthrough this channel will be substantial. Since the individual anomalies can be\nwell modeled by much simpler single planet lensing models, the proposed method\nhas an important advantage of allowing one to accurately determine the\nparameters of the individual planets.\n", "  We present UBVI CCD photometry of the stellar contents and globular\ncluster(GC) candidates in the spiral galaxy NGC 300 in the Sculptor group.\nColor-magnitude diagrams for 18 OB associations having more than 30 member\nstars are presented. The slope of the initial mass function for the bright\nstars in NGC 300 is estimated to be Gamma = -2.6 +/- 0.3. Assuming the distance\nto NGC 300 of (m-M)_0 = 26.53 +/- 0.07, the mean absolute magnitude of three\nbrightest blue stars is obtained to be <M_V^{BSG}(3)> = -8.95 mag. We have\nperformed search for GCs in NGC 300 and have found 17 GC candidates in this\ngalaxy. Some characteristics of these GC candidates are discussed.\n", "  We have made a topological study of cosmic microwave background (CMB)\npolarization maps by simulating the AMiBA experiment results. A $\\Lambda$CDM\nCMB sky is adopted to make mock interferometric observations designed for the\nAMiBA experiment. CMB polarization fields are reconstructed from the AMiBA mock\nvisibility data using the maximum entropy method. We have also considered\neffects of Galactic foregrounds on the CMB polarization fields. The genus\nstatistic is calculated from the simulated $Q$ and $U$ polarization maps, where\n$Q$ and $U$ are Stokes parameters. Our study shows that the Galactic foreground\nemission, even at low Galactic latitude, is expected to have small effects on\nthe CMB polarization field. Increasing survey area and integration time is\nessential to detect non-Gaussian signals of cosmological origin through genus\nmeasurement.\n", "  We study the formation and evolution of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)\nhalos. We find analytical, fully cosmological similarity solutions taking\naccount of the collisional interaction of SIDM particles. This interaction\nresults in a thermal conductivity that heats the halo core and flattens its\ndensity profile. These similarity solutions are relevant to galactic and\ncluster halo formation in the CDM model. We assume an initial mass profile dM/M\nM^{-eps}, as in the familiar secondary infall model. If eps=1/6, SIDM halos\nwill evolve self-similarly, with a cold, supersonic infall terminated by a\nstrong accretion shock. Different solutions arise for different values of the\ncollisionality parameter, Q= sigma rho_b r_s, where sigma is the scattering\ncross section, rho_b is the cosmic mean density, and r_s is the shock radius.\nFor all these solutions, a flat-density, isothermal core is present which grows\nin size as a fixed fraction of r_s. We find two different regimes for these\nsolutions: 1) for Q \\leq Q_{th}, the core density decreases and core size\nincreases as Q increases; 2) for Q \\geq Q_{th}, the core density increases and\ncore size decreases as Q increases. Our similarity solutions are in agreement\nwith previous N-body simulations of SIDM halos, which correspond to the low-Q\nregime, if Q=[8.4e-4 - 4.9e-2]Q_{th} (low-Q), or sigma=[0.56-5.6]cm^2/g. As\nQ=\\infty, our similarity solution aquires a central density cusp, in agreement\nwith some simulation results which used an ordinary collisional fluid to\napproximate the effects of SIDM collisionality. When Q=[18.6-231]Q_{th} or\nsigma=[1.2e4 - 2.71e4]cm^2/g, for which we find flat-density cores comparable\nto those of the observationally acceptable low-Q solutions, has not previously\nbeen identified. Further study of this regime is warranted.\n", "  Nonthermal particles can be produced due to incomplete thermalization at\ncollisionless shocks and further accelerated to very high energies via\ndiffusive shock acceleration. In a previous study we explored the cosmic ray\n(CR) acceleration at cosmic shocks through numerical simulations of CR\nmodified, quasi-parallel shocks in 1D plane-parallel geometry with the physical\nparameters relevant for the shocks emerging in the large scale structure\nformation of the universe (Kang & Jones 2002). In order to consider the CR\nacceleration at shocks with a broader range of physical properties, in this\ncontribution we present additional simulations. For a given Mach number, shocks\nwith higher speeds accelerate CRs faster with a greater number of particles.\nHowever, two shocks with a same Mach number but with different shock speeds\nevolve qualitatively similarly when the results are presented in terms of\ndiffusion length and time scales. Therefore, the time asymptotic value for the\nfraction of shock kinetic energy transferred to CRs is mainly controlled by\nshock Mach number rather than shock speed. We present the ``CR energy ratio''\nfor a wide range of shock parameters and for $\\epsilon=0.2-0.3$ at terminal\ntime of our simulations. We suggest that these values can be considered as\ntime-asymptotic values for the CR acceleration efficiency, since the\ntime-dependent evolution of CR modified shocks has become approximately\nself-similar before the terminal time.\n", "  We present a study of the old open cluster Trumpler 5 (Tr 5), based on the\nCDS archival data. From the color-magnitude diagrams of Tr 5, we have found the\npositions of main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and red giant clump (RGC) stars.\nUsing the mean magnitude of the RGC stars, we have estimated the reddening\ntoward Tr 5, E(B-V) = 0.60 +/- 0.10. Using the stars common in two data sets\nand the theoretical isochrones of Padova group, we have estimated the distance\nmodulus V_0-M_V=12.64 +/- 0.20 (d = 3.4 +/- 0.3 kpc), the metallicity [Fe/H] =\n-0.30 +/- 0.10, and the age of 2.4 +/- 0.2 Gyr (log t=9.38). These metallicity\nand distance values are consistent with the relation between the metallicity\nand the Galactocentric distance of other old open clusters, for which we obtain\nthe slope of Delta_[Fe/H]/R_gc= -0.064 +/- 0.010 dex/kpc.\n", "  CCD observations in V, I and H$_\\alpha$ for NGC 3389 are used to present\nphotometry of 61 HII regions. Their $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ positions, diameters\nand their absolute luminosities have been determined. The luminosity and size\ndistribution functions of the HII regions in NGC 3389 are discussed.\n", "  The existence of cooling flows in the center of galaxy clusters has always\nbeen a puzzle, and in particular the fate of the cooling gas, since the\npresence of cold gas has never been proven directly. X-ray data from the\nsatellites Chandra and XMM-Newton have constrained the amount of cooling, and\nit was realized that feedback and heating from a central AGN and its jets could\nreduce the amount of cold gas.\n  Recently, a few central galaxies of cooling flow clusters have been detected\nin the CO lines. For the first time, we show IRAM interferometer maps of\nCO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission in a cooling flow, showing a clear association of\nthe cold gas (at about 20K) with the cooling flow. This shows that although the\nAGN provides a feedback heating, the cooling phenomenon does occur, with about\nthe expected rate.\n", "  We present a compilation of PRONAOS-based results concerning the temperature\ndependence of the dust submillimeter spectral index, including data from\nGalactic cirrus, star-forming regions, dust associated to a young stellar\nobject, and a spiral galaxy. We observe large variations of the spectral index\n(from 0.8 to 2.4) in a wide range of temperatures (11 to 80 K). These spectral\nindex variations follow a hyperbolic-shaped function of the temperature, high\nspectral indices (1.6-2.4) being observed in cold regions (11-20 K) while low\nindices (0.8-1.6) are observed in warm regions (35-80 K). Three distinct\neffects may play a role in this temperature dependence: one is that the grain\nsizes change in dense environments, another is that the chemical composition of\nthe grains is not the same in different environments, a third one is that there\nis an intrinsic dependence of the dust spectral index on the temperature due to\nquantum processes. This last effect is backed up by laboratory measurements and\ncould be the dominant one.\n  We also briefly present a joint analysis of WMAP dust data together with\nCOBE/DIRBE and COBE/FIRAS data.\n", "  The NUGA project is the first high-resolution (0.5''-1'') CO survey of low\nluminosity AGN including the full sequence of activity types (Seyfert 1--2 and\nLINERs). NUGA aims to study systematically the different mechanisms for gas\nfueling of the AGN. In order to reach the critical spatial scales for AGN\nfeeding (<100 pc), we are undertaking high-resolution observations, made at the\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer, to achieve a sharp view of the distribution and\nkinematics of molecular gas. In this talk we discuss the latest results of this\nsurvey which now includes newly acquired subarcsec resolution observations for\n5 targets of our sample. The large variety of circumnuclear disk morphologies\nfound in NUGA galaxies (m=1, m=2 and m=0-type gravitational instabilities) is a\nchallenging result that urges the refinement of current dynamical models.\n", "  The SIRTF mission and the Legacy programs will provide coherent data bases\nfor extra-galactic and Galactic science that will rapidly become available to\nresearchers through a public archive. The capabilities of SIRTF and the six\nlegacy programs are described briefly. Then the cores to disks (c2d) program is\ndescribed in more detail. The c2d program will use all three SIRTF instruments\n(IRAC, MIPS, and IRS) to observe sources from molecular cores to protoplanetary\ndisks, with a wide range of cloud masses, stellar masses, and star-forming\nenvironments. The SIRTF data will stimulate many follow-up studies, both with\nSIRTF and with other instruments.\n", "  We observed 20 nearby Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) in HI and\nCO(J=2-1) with the GBT and JCMT. These ~L^star galaxies are blue, high surface\nbrightness, starbursting, high metallicity galaxies with an underlying older\nstellar population. They are common at z~1, but rare in the local Universe. It\nhas been proposed that intermediate redshift LCBGs may be the progenitors of\nlocal dwarf ellipticals or low luminosity spirals, or that they may be more\nmassive disks forming from the center outward to become L^star galaxies. To\ndiscriminate among various possible evolutionary scenarios, we have measured\nthe dynamical masses and gas depletion time scales of this sample of nearby\nLCBGs.\n  We find that local LCBGs span a wide range of dynamical masses, from 4 x 10^9\nto 1 x 10^11 M_solar (measured within R_25). Molecular gas in local LCBGs is\ndepleted quite quickly, in 30 to 200 million years. The molecular plus atomic\ngas is depleted in 30 million to 10 billion years; however, ~80% of the local\nLCBGs deplete their gas in less than 5 billion years. As LCBGs are\nheterogeneous in both dynamical mass and gas depletion time scales, they are\nnot likely to evolve into one homogeneous galaxy class.\n", "  The likely merger process and the properties of the stellar populations in\nthe I Zw 1 host galaxy are analyzed on the basis of multi-wavelength\nobservations (with the ISAAC camera at the Very Large Telescope (VLT/UT1) of\nthe European Southern Observatory (ESO), Chile (Paranal), with the\ninterferometer of the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA), USA (Hat\nCreek/California), and with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI),\nFrance) and N-body simulations. The data give a consistent picture of I Zw 1,\nwith properties between those of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and\nQSOs as displayed by transition objects in the evolutionary sequence of active\ngalaxies.\n", "  How does turbulence contribute to the formation and structure of the dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM)? Molecular clouds are dense, high-pressure objects.\nIt is usually argued that gravitational confinement causes the high pressures,\nand that the clouds are (magneto)hydrostaticobjects supported by a balance\nbetween magnetic and turbulent pressures and gravity. However, magnetic\npressures appear too weak, and MHD turbulent support not only requires driving,\nbut also results in continuing gravitational collapse, as has now been\ndemonstrated in simulations reaching 512^3 zones. Models of supernova-driven,\nmagnetized turbulence readily form transient, high-pressure, dense regions that\nmay form molecular clouds. They are contained not by self-gravity, but by\nturbulent ram pressures from the larger flow. Apparent virialization may\nactually be a geometrical effect. Turbulent clouds are unlikely to be in\nhydrostatic equilibrium, instead either collapsing or expanding, although they\nmay appear well-fit by projected equilibrium Bonnor-Ebert spheres. Collapsing\nclouds probably form stars efficiently, while expanding ones can still form\nstars by turbulent compression, but rather inefficiently.\n", "  In this contribution we present new near-infrared (NIR) data on the quasar 3C\n48 and its host galaxy, obtained with ISAAC at the Very Large Telescope (ESO,\nChile). The NIR images and spectra reveal a reddening of several magnitudes\ncaused by extinction due to molecular material and dust within the host galaxy.\nFor the first time we clearly identify the highly reddened potential second\nnucleus 3C 48A about 100 northeast of the quasar position in the NIR. Its\nreddening can be accounted for by warm dust, heated by star formation or an\ninteraction of the 3C 48 radio jet with the interstellar medium, or both. The\nNIR colors and the CO(6-3) absorption feature both give a stellar contribution\nof about 30 percent to the QSO-dominated light. These results will contribute\nto the question of how the nuclear activity and the apparent merger process are\ninfluencing the host galaxy properties and they will improve existing models.\n", "  Molecular lines hold valuable information on the physical and chemical\ncomposition of disks around young stars, the likely progenitors of planetary\nsystems. This invited contribution discusses techniques to calculate the\nmolecular emission (and absorption) line spectrum based on models for the\nphysical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks. Four examples of\nrecent research illutrate these techniques in practice: matching resolved\nmolecular-line emission from the disk around LkCa15 with theoertical models for\nthe chemistry; evaluating the two-dimensional transfer of ultraviolet radiation\ninto the disk, and the effect on the HCN/CN ratio; far-infrared CO line\nemission from a superheated disk surface layer; and inward motions in the disk\naround L1489 IRS.\n", "  This paper explores the sensitivity of line profiles of H2D+, HCO+ and N2H+,\nobserved towards the center of L1544, to various kinematic and chemical\nparameters. The total width of the H2D+ line can be matched by a static model\nand by models invoking ambipolar diffusion and gravitational collapse. The\nderived turbulent line width is b=0.15 km/s for the static case and <~ 0.05\nkm/s for the collapse case. However, line profiles of HC18O+ and N2H+ rule out\nthe static solution. The double-peaked H2D+ line shape requires either infall\nspeeds in the center that are much higher than predicted by ambipolar diffusion\nmodels, or a shell-type distribution of H2D+, as is the case for HCO+ and N2H+.\nAt an offset of ~20 arcsec from the dust peak, the H2D+ abundance drops by a\nfactor of ~5.\n", "  A major limitation and a continuing source of confusion in the interpretation\nof molecular line observations has been the large degree of chemical complexity\nthat is observed in star-forming molecular cores. The past decade has seen\ndramatic improvements in our ability to extract chemical information from\nmolecular line observations. These advances have been driven by new\nobservational platforms and techniques that use combined studies of molecular\nemission and dust emission/absorption to derive chemical abundances. I will\noutline the various methods and uncertainties in computing chemical information\nfrom observations and discuss these new techniques that allow for the\nestimation of line of sight structure in molecular abundance in both quiescent\nand active star forming regions. I will show how improved chemical knowledge\ncan be used to place stronger constraints on theoretical astrochemical models,\nbut also open new avenues in the use of molecular emission to examine the\nphysics of molecular clouds and star formation. Thus, we can begin the process\nof unraveling the chemical complexities and more fully realize the\nlong-standing promise of molecular line observations.\n", "  We report on high-angular resolution observations of a dense core in the\ncirrus cloud MCLD123.5+24.9 obtained with the PdB and the OVRO interferometers.\nOur maps show substructures down to the scale of the beam (~ 1000 AU). The\nchosen molecules CS(2-1) and HC_3N(10-9) trace different regions in the core.\nThis can be explained by time-dependent chemical evolution of the cloud and\ntherefore provides constraints on the timescales of the fragmentation and core\nformation processes. Our data demonstrate that the chemical evolution plays the\ndecisive role in our attempt to interpret observational data of different gas\ndensity tracers.\n", "  We present results from an extensive survey of molecular gas in nearby dwarf\ngalaxies. This survey consists of a single-dish search for CO emission at the\nUASO Kitt Peak 12m telescope and interferometric follow-up using the\nBerkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array. We have detected 41 new sources,\napproximately doubling the number of detections of such objects in the\nliterature. In this paper we discuss two results from the survey that lead us\nto agree with recent suggestions that, above a metallicity of 12+log[O/H]~8.0,\nthere appears to be little variation in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor for\nstar-forming molecular gas. We find two major pieces of evidence for this\nresult: 1) the virial mass to molecular mass ratio found from the\ninterferometer observations in a variety of sources shows no clear trend with\nmetallicity; and 2) dwarf galaxies appear to exhibit a CO-to-radio continuum\nrelationship that is similar to that observed in larger, presumably metal-rich,\ngalaxies leaving little room for a large systematic variation of the CO-to-H2\nconversion factor with metallicity in the star-forming gas.\n", "  One of the most informative techniques of studying magnetic fields in\nmolecular clouds is based on the use of starlight polarization and polarized\nemission arising from aligned dust. How reliable the interpretation of the\npolarization maps in terms of magnetic fields is the issue that the grain\nalignment theory addresses.\n  I briefly review basic physical processes involved in grain alignment.\n", "  In recent years large efforts have been made to detect molecular gas towards\nhigh redshifted objects. Up to now the literature reports on only two cases of\nCO-detection in quasars at a redshift between 1 and 2 - Q0957+561, a\ngravitationally lensed system at z=1.41 (Planesas et al. 1999), and HR10 at\nz=1.44 (Andreani et al. 2000). According to Planesas et al. (1999), 12CO(2-1)\nemission was detected towards both the lensed images of Q0957+561 with the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). In contrast to the optical spectra of\nthe two images which support the idea that they are images of one and the same\nobject, the CO-spectra were surprisingly different: the southern image (named\nCO-B) shows a single blueshifted line whereas a double-peaked line profile with\na blue- and a redshifted part appears towards the northern image (CO-A). Based\non the observations and on simulations with a gravitational lens program, we\nare tempted to argue that the line profile traces the presence of molecular gas\nof a disk in the host galaxy around the quasar. We have now new observations\nwith the PdBI providing the necessary sensitivity to corroborate our disk\nmodel.\n", "  Observations of Carbon bearing species are among the most important\ndiagnostic probes of ongoing star formation. CO is a surrogate for H$_2$ and is\nfound in the vicinity of star formation sites. There, [CI] emission is thought\nto outline the dense molecular cores and extend into the lower density regions,\nwhere the impinging interstellar UV radiation field plays a critical role for\nthe dissociation and ionization processes. Emission of ionized carbon ([CII])\nis found to be even more extended than [CI] and is linking up with the ionized\nmedium. These different tracers emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength\nstudies to draw a coherent picture of the processes driving and driven by high\nmass star formation. Until now, large scale surveys were only done with low\nresolution, such as the COBE full sky survey, or were biased to a few selected\nbright sources (e.g. Yamamoto et al. 2001, Schneider et al. 2003). A broader\nbasis of unbiased, high-resolution observations of [CI], CO, and [CII] may play\na key role to probe the material processed by UV radiation.\n", "  The topic of the stellar \"original mass function\" has a nearly 50 year\nhistory,dating to the publication in 1955 of Salpeter's seminal paper. In this\nreview I discuss the many more recent results that have emerged on the initial\nmass function (IMF), as it is now called, from studies over the last decade of\nresolved populations in star forming regions and young open clusters.\n", "  We have used the KOSMA 3m telescope to map the core 7'x5' of the Galactic\nmassive star forming region W3Main in the two fine structure lines of atomic\ncarbon and four mid-J transitions of CO and 13CO. In combination with a map of\nsingly ionized carbon (Howe et al. 1991), and FIR fine structure line data\nobserved by ISO/LWS at the center position, these data sets allow to study in\ndetail the physical structure of the photon dominated cloud interface regions\n(PDRs) where the occurance of carbon changes from CII to CI, and to CO.\n", "  Although far-IR -- mm-wave astronomy has now been developing for several\ndecades, access to this portion of the spectrum remains difficult and limited.\nRelative to their optical-wavelength counterparts, the submillimeter\nobservatories are both small in units of wavelength and hot in units of photon\nenergy, which imposes limits on their angular resolution and sensitivity.\nNevertheless, even the modest far-IR and submillimeter observations obtained in\nthe last two decades have revolutionized our understanding the physics and\nchemistry of the ISM, the formation of stars, and the cosmic history of these\nprocesses. The demonstration by COBE that about half of the radiant energy\nreleased in the universe since decoupling comes to us in the submm/far--IR has\nfurther underscored the scientific necessity of observations in this wavelength\nregime. The next decade promises even greater discoveries, as new observatories\nand detectors are still pushing toward fundamental limits. The paper briefly\noutlines some of the exciting capabilities and scientific roles of new\nsingle-dish far--IR -- mm-wave telescopes and their instruments.\n", "  In this review, I highlight a number of recent surveys of molecular gas in\nnearby spiral galaxies. Through such surveys, more complete observations of the\ndistribution and kinematics of molecular gas have become available for galaxies\nwith a wider range of properties (e.g., brightness, Hubble type, strength of\nspiral or bar structure). These studies show the promise of both\ninterferometers and single-dish telescopes in advancing our general\nunderstanding of molecular gas in spiral galaxies. In particular, I highlight\nthe contributions of the recent BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies (SONG).\n", "  We here present an innovative technique to handle the problem of deriving\nphysical parameters from observed multi-line spectra of methanol, based on the\nsimultaneous fit of all the lines with a synthetic spectrum computed under the\nLarge Velocity Gradient approximation; the best physical parameters are found\nusing numerical methods.\n", "  In the course of a comprehensive mm/submm survey of massive star-forming\nregions, a particularly interesting object has been found in the surroundings\nof the bright FIR source IRAS 07029-1215, in a distance of 1 kpc. The object --\nnamed UYSO 1 (Unidentified Young Stellar Object 1) -- is cold (T=40 K), it has\na massive envelope, and it is associated with an energetic molecular outflow.\nNo infrared point source has been detected at its position for wavelengths\nbelow 20 micron. Therefore, it is a very good candidate for a member of the\nlong searched for group of massive protostars.\n", "  We present a high-resolution spectroscopic study of the envelope of the young\nClass 0 protostar IRAM 04191+1522 in Taurus. N2H+(1-0) observations with the\nPlateau de Bure Interferometer and the IRAM 30m telescope demonstrate that the\nmolecular ion N2H+ disappears from the gas phase in the inner envelope (r <\n1600 AU, n(H2) > 4-7 * 1e5 cm-3). This may result from N2 depletion on polar\nice mantles and enhanced grain chemistry.\n", "  We report new observations of the H_2O megamaser in the Seyfert 2 galaxy\nMrk348. The line is redshifted by about 130 km s^-1 with respect to the\nsystemic velocity, is extremely broad, with a FWHM of 130 km s^-1, and has no\ndetectable high velocity components within 1500 km s^-1 on either side of the\nobserved line. The unusual line profile led us to suspect that this source,\nmight belong to a class of megamaser galaxies in which the amplified emission\nis the result of an interaction between the radio jet and an encroaching\nmolecular cloud, rather than occurring in a circumnuclear disk. Our initial\nVLBA observations show that the maser emission emanates entirely from a region\n<0.25 pc in extent, located toward a continuum component thought to be\nassociated with the receding jet. The very high linewidth occurring on such\nsmall spatial scales and the rapid variability indicate that the H_2O emission\nis likely to arise from a shocked region at the interface between the energetic\njet material and the molecular gas in the cloud where the jet is boring\nthrough. The orientation of the radio jets close to the plane of the sky also\nresults in shocks with the preferred orientation for strong masers from our\nvantage point. Single-dish monitoring with the Effelsberg 100m telescope showed\nthat the line and continuum emission \"flared\" on very similar timescales. The\nclose temporal correlation between this activity in the maser emission and the\ncontinuum flare further suggest that the masing region and the continuum\nhotspots are nearly equidistant from the central engine and may be different\nmanifestations of the same dynamical events.\n  (abridged abstract)\n", "  At a distance of 8 kpc only, the center of the Galaxy provides a unique\ntestbed for studies about the physics of the interstellar medium and star\nformation in the nuclei of galaxies. Since it shares many properties of other,\nmore spectacular nuclei, a detailed investigation of the Galactic Center is a\nnecessary step to gain better understanding of the physical processes governing\ngalactic nuclei in general. We review the characteristics of the central\nmolecular cloud layer, the physical properties of these clouds, and their\ninterplay with the magnetic field.\n", "  Gisbert Winnewisser's astronomical career was practically coextensive with\nthe whole development of molecular radio astronomy. Here I would like to pick\nout a few of his many contributions, which I, personally, find particularly\ninteresting and put them in the context of newer results.\n", "  The far-IR is a unique wavelength range for Astrophysical studies, however,\nit can only be fully sampled from space platforms. The fundamental rotational\ntransitions of light molecules, the high-J transitions of polyatomic species,\nthe bending modes of non-polar molecules, several atomic fine structure lines\nand many frequencies blocked by the earth atmosphere can only be observed\nbetween 50 and 200 um (6.0 and 1.5 THz). In this contribution we present the\nfar-IR spectrum of Sgr B2 at a resolution of ~35 km s^{-1}, the ``Rosetta\nstone'' of ISO's far-IR spectra. We also discuss the perspectives of the far-IR\nAstronomy in the context of the future telescopes under development.\n", "  This paper deals with the heating and the ionization of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) in the 500 central pc of the Milky Way (hereafter Galactic center,\nGC). We review the results of the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations\nof a sample of GC molecular clouds located far from thermal radiocontinuum or\nfar-infrared sources. For the first time, we have been able to study in detail\nthe dust continuum spectra from 40 to 190 microns founding a warm (30-40 K)\ndust component in addition to the well known 15-20 K component. Fine-structure\nlines observations have revealed the presence of diffuse ionized gas associated\nwith the molecular clouds. The effective temperature of the ionizing radiation\nis higher than 33000 K. ISO has also allow us to measure the fraction of warm\n(~ 150 K) H2 in the GC clouds, which is on average of 30 %. The observations of\nthe warm (a few 100 K) neutral gas are compatible with a Photon Dominated\nRegion (PDR) scenario.\n", "  We have searched for HI 21 cm line emission from shocked atomic gas\nassociated with southern supernova remnants (SNRs) using data from the Southern\nGalactic Plane Survey. Among the 97 sources studied, we have detected 10 SNRs\nwith high-velocity HI emission confined to the SNR. The large velocity and the\nspatial confinement suggest that the emission is likely from the gas\naccelerated by the SN blast wave. We also detected 22 SNRs which show HI\nemission significantly brighter than the surrounding regions over a wide\n($>10$\\kms) velocity interval. The association with these SNRs is less certain.\nWe present the parameters and maps of the excess emission in these SNRs. We\ndiscuss in some detail the ten individual SNRs with associated high-velocity HI\nemission.\n", "  We present first and preliminary submillimeter continuum images of the\nGalactic Center region obtained with the new Caltech Submillimeter Observatory\nfacility camera SHARC II. The instrument allows 350 micron observations with\nunprecedented sensitivity and instantaneous spatial coverage. The stability of\nthe SHARC II detectors combined with the large number of available pixels\nallows a non-differential scanning mode that does not require the observation\nof a reference off-source position. Here we present large-scale 350 micron dust\ncontinuum images from the Sgr A and Sgr C regions, as well as the detection of\nsub-mm dust continuum emission from the IRAS 25 micron source AFGL5376. This\nsource is produced in a large-scale shock that extends well above the Galactic\nplane.\n", "  We present JHK-band near-infrared photometry of star clusters in the dwarf\nirregular galaxy IC 5152. After excluding possible foreground stars, a number\nof candidate star clusters are identified in the near-infrared images of IC\n5152, which include young populations. Especially, five young star clusters are\nidentified in the (J-H, H-K) two color diagram and the total extinction values\ntoward these clusters are estimated to be A_V =2 - 6 from the comparison with\nthe theoretical values given by the Leitherer et al. (1999)'s theoretical star\ncluster model.\n", "  Starting from a Calogero--Sutherland model with hyperbolic interaction\nconfined by an external field with Morse potential we construct a Heisenberg\nspin chain with exchange interaction $\\propto 1/\\sinh^2 x$ on a lattice given\nin terms of the zeroes of Laguerre polynomials. Varying the strength of the\nMorse potential the Haldane--Shastry and harmonic spin chains are reproduced.\nThe spectrum of the models in this class is found to be that of a classical\none-dimensional Ising chain with nonuniform nearest neighbour coupling in a\nnonuniform magnetic field which allows to study the thermodynamics in the limit\nof infinite chains.\n", "  The generalized Second Law of thermodynamics and the Holographic Principle\nare combined to obtain the maximum mass of black holes formed inside a static\nspherical box of size $R$ filled with radiation at initial temperature $T_{i}$.\nThe final temperature after the formation of black holes is evaluated, and we\nshow that a critical threshold exists for the radiation to be fully consumed by\nthe process. We next argue that if some form of Holographic Principle holds,\nupper bounds to the mass density of PBHs formed in the early universe may be\nobtained. The limits are worked out for inflationary and non-inflationary\ncosmological models. This method is independent of the known limits based on\nthe background fluxes (from cosmic rays, radiation and other forms of energy)\nand applies to potentially important epochs of PBH formation, resulting in\nquite strong constraints to $\\Omega_{pbh}$.\n", "  The temperature gradient of microwave background radiation (CMBR) is\ncalculated in the Self Consistent Model. An expected values for Hubble\nparameter have been presented in two different cases. In the first case the\ntemperature is treated as a function of time only, while in the other one the\ntemperature depends on relaxation of isotropy condition in the self-consistent\nmodel and the assumption that the universe expands adiabatically. The COBE's or\nWMAP's fluctuations in temperature of CMBR may be used to predict a value for\nHubble parameter.\n", "  In this paper we provide the techniques and proofs for the resuls presented\nin our companion paper concerning the consistency check on volume and triad\noperator quantisation in Loop Quantum Gravity.\n", "  Thermal activation is mediated by field configurations that correspond to\nsaddle points of the energy functional. The rate of probability flow along the\nunstable functional directions, i.e the activation rate, is usually obtained\nfrom the imaginary part of a suitable analytic continuation of the equilibrium\nfree energy. In this note we provide a real-time, non-equilibrium\ninterpretation of this imaginary part which is analogous to the real-time\ninterpretation of the imaginary part of the one-loop effective potential in\ntheories with symmetry breaking. We argue that in situations in which the\nsystem is strongly out of equilibrium the rate will be time dependent and\nillustrate this with an example.\n", "  In this short note we give an example of the exact solution of the open\nbosonic string field theory defined on the background of $N$ coincided\nD0-branes. This solution leads to the change of the original background to the\nbackground where D0-branes are localised in general positions.\n", "  Basic idea of Randall-Sundrum brane world model I and II is reviewed with\ndetailed calculation. After introducing the brane world metric with exponential\nwarp factor, metrics of Randall-Sundrum models are constructed. We explain how\nRandall-Sundrum model I with two branes makes the gauge hierarchy problem much\nmilder, and then derive Newtonian gravity in Randall-Sundrum model II with a\nsingle brane by considering small fluctuations.\n", "  We test the recently conjectured duality between $N=2$ supersymmetric type II\nand heterotic string models by analysing a class of higher dimensional\ninteractions in the respective low-energy Lagrangians. These are $F$-terms of\nthe form $F_g W^{2g}$ where $W$ is the gravitational superfield. On the type II\nside these terms are generated at the $g$-loop level and in fact are given by\ntopological partition functions of the twisted Calabi-Yau sigma model. We show\nthat on the heterotic side these terms arise at the one-loop level. We study in\ndetail a rank 3 example and show that the corresponding couplings $F_g$ satisfy\nthe same holomorphic anomaly equations as in the type II case. Moreover we\nstudy the leading singularities of $F_g$'s on the heterotic side, near the\nenhanced symmetry point and show that they are universal poles of order\n$2g{-}2$ with coefficients that are given by the Euler number of the moduli\nspace of genus-$g$ Riemann surfaces. This confirms a recent conjecture that the\nphysics near conifold singularity is governed by $c{=}1$ string theory at the\nself-dual point.\n"]}
