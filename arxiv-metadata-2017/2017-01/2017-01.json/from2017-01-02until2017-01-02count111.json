The two annular layers contain distinct cloaking materials:\nthe outer layer provides invisibility; the inner layer is fully absorbing. The\ncloaking materials are weakly degenerative. The wavefield from an EM source\nlocated outside the cloak propagates as in free space outside the outer shell,\nnever be disturbed by the cloak and does not penetrate into the inner absorbing\nlayer and concealment.\n  The field of a source located inside inner layer or the cloaked concealment\nis completely absorbed by the inner layer and never reaches the outside of the\nmiddle shell, Moreover, the EM wavefield excited in concealment is not\ndisrupted by the cloak. There exists no Maxwell EM wavefield can be excited in\na single layer cloaked concealment which is filled by normal material.\nMoreover, we find a negative dielectric and positive susceptibility\nmetamaterial to fill into the concealment, such that the interior EM wave\npropagates from the concealment to free space through the single layer cloak.\nTherefore, the double layer cloak is important and necessary for complete\ninvisibility. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis verifying these\nproperties are performed using the GL EM modeling method that we described in\nthis paper.\n", "  In this work, the quantum phase transition in the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model\nis studied using a single-mode approximation, by combining the rotating wave\ntransformation and the transformations used in the numerical renormalization\ngroup (NRG). Analytical results for the critical coupling strength $\\alpha_c$,\nthe magnetic susceptibility $\\chi(T)$, and the spin-spin correlation function\n$C(\\omega)$ at finite temperatures are obtained and further confirmed by\nnumerical results. We obtain the same $\\alpha_c$ as the mean-field\napproximation. The critical exponents are classical: $\\beta=1/2$, $\\delta=3$,\n$\\gamma=1$, $x=1/2$, $y_t^{*}=1/2$, in agreement with the spin-boson model in\n$0<s<1/2$ regime. $C(\\omega)$ has nontrivial behavior reflecting coherent\noscillation with temperature dependent damping effects due to the environment.\nWe point out the original NRG has problem with the crossover temperature\n$T^{*}$, and propose a chain Hamiltonian possibly suitable for implementing NRG\nwithout boson state truncation error.\n", "  The theory of minimal K-types for p-adic reductive groups was developed in\npart to classify irreducible admissible representations with wild ramification.\nAn important observation was that minimal K-types associated to such\nrepresentations correspond to fundamental strata. These latter objects are\ntriples (x, r, beta), where x is a point in the Bruhat-Tits building of the\nreductive group G, r is a nonnegative real number, and beta is a semistable\nfunctional on the degree r associated graded piece of the Moy-Prasad filtration\ncorresponding to x.\n  Recent work on the wild ramification case of the geometric Langlands\nconjectures suggests that fundamental strata also play a role in the geometric\nsetting. In this paper, we develop a theory of minimal K-types for formal flat\nG-bundles. We show that any formal flat G-bundle contains a fundamental\nstratum; moreover, all such strata have the same rational depth. We thus obtain\na new invariant of a flat G-bundle called the slope, generalizing the classical\ndefinition for flat connections. The slope can also be realized as the minimum\ndepth of a stratum contained in the flat G-bundle, and in the case of positive\nslope, all such minimal depth strata are fundamental. Finally, we show that a\nflat G-bundle is irregular singular if and only if it has positive slope.\n", "  We present a fast direct algorithm for computing symmetric factorizations,\ni.e. $A = WW^T$, of symmetric positive-definite hierarchical matrices with\nweak-admissibility conditions. The computational cost for the symmetric\nfactorization scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ for hierarchically\noff-diagonal low-rank matrices. Once this factorization is obtained, the cost\nfor inversion, application, and determinant computation scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$. In particular, this allows for the near optimal\ngeneration of correlated random variates in the case where $A$ is a covariance\nmatrix. This symmetric factorization algorithm depends on two key ingredients.\nFirst, we present a novel symmetric factorization formula for low-rank updates\nto the identity of the form $I+UKU^T$. This factorization can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time if the rank of the perturbation is sufficiently small.\nSecond, combining this formula with a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy,\nnear linear complexity symmetric factorizations for hierarchically structured\nmatrices can be obtained. We present numerical results for matrices relevant to\nproblems in probability \\& statistics (Gaussian processes), interpolation\n(Radial basis functions), and Brownian dynamics calculations in fluid mechanics\n(the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor).\n", "  This paper documents the places in mainland Europe at which the sun sets\nlatest, by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), on any given day (distortion due\nto differences in local standard times is ignored). In contradiction to the\nna\\\"ive assumption that the sun always sets latest at the westernmost point,\nthe point of last sunset changes cyclically over the course of a year due to\nthe changing orientation of the axis of the Earth with respect to the sun.\nSpecifically, between the winter and summer solstices the last sunset shifts\nsuccessively from Cabo de Sao Vicente (Portugal) to Cabo da Roca (Portugal) to\nCabo Tourinan (Spain) to a site near Aglapsvik (Norway) to a location in the\nNorwegian municipality of Masoy south of Havoysund; and it shifts back again\nbetween the summer and winter solstices. There are two days in the year (April\n24th and August 18th) on which the last sunset of mainland Europe (shared in\nthose days effectively by Cabo Tourinan and the Aglapsvik area) coincides with\nthe last sunset of mainland Africa, at a site in Western Sahara near Cap Blanc.\nA similar analysis of the first Spanish sunrise shows that from April 22nd to\nAugust 20th it occurs on the Costa Brava at Cap de Creus (Catalonia), and the\nrest of the year at Punta de s'Espero (Balearic Islands), the easternmost point\nof Spain.\n", "  We present an efficient impurity solver for the dynamical mean-field theory\n(DMFT). It is based on the separation of bath degrees of freedom into the low\nenergy and the high energy parts. The former is solved exactly using exact\ndiagonalization and the latter is treated approximately using Green's function\nequation of motion decoupling approximation. The two parts are combined\ncoherently under the standard basis operator formalism. The impurity solver is\napplied to the Anderson impurity model and, combined with DMFT, to the one-band\nHubbard model. Qualitative agreement is found with other well established\nmethods. Some promising features and possible improvements of the present\nsolver are discussed.\n", "  The extended Bloch representation of quantum mechanics was recently derived\nto offer a (hidden-measurement) solution to the measurement problem. In this\narticle we use it to investigate the geometry of superposition and entangled\nstates, explaining the interference effects, and the entanglement correlations,\nin terms of the different orientations that a state-vector can take within the\ngeneralized Bloch sphere. We also introduce a tensorial determination of the\ngenerators of SU(N), particularly suitable to describe multipartite systems,\nfrom the viewpoint of the sub-entities. We then use it to show that non-product\nstates admit a general description in which the sub-entities can always remain\nin well-defined states, even when they are entangled. Therefore, the completed\nversion of quantum mechanics provided by the extended Bloch representation, in\nwhich the density operators are also representative of pure states, allows to\nsolve not only the well-known measurement problem, but also the lesser-known\nentanglement problem. This because we no longer need to give up the general\nphysical principle saying that a composite entity exists, and therefore is in a\npure state, if and only if its components also exist, and therefore are in\nwell-defined pure states.\n", "  Social systems are in a constant state of flux with dynamics spanning from\nminute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years.\nAccurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding spreading of\ninfluence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams.\nWhile there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the\npast decade, little is known about the regularities governing the\nmicro-dynamics of social networks. Here we explore the dynamic social network\nof a densely-connected population of approximately 1000 individuals and their\ninteractions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured\nvia Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media\ncontacts, geo-location, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow\nus to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection\nunnecessary. Starting from 5-minute time slices we uncover dynamic social\nstructures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find\nthat gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a\nstable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores\nexhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with\nvarying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a\npowerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent\nfundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity.\nUsing this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and\ngeospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores are preceded by\ncoordination behavior in the communication networks, and demonstrating that\nsocial behavior can be predicted with high precision.\n", "  Modularity is widely used to effectively measure the strength of the\ncommunity structure found by community detection algorithms. However,\nmodularity maximization suffers from two opposite yet coexisting problems: in\nsome cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in\nothers, large communities over small ones. The latter tendency is known in the\nliterature as the resolution limit problem. To address them, we propose to\nmodify modularity by subtracting from it the fraction of edges connecting nodes\nof different communities and by including community density into modularity. We\nrefer to the modified metric as Modularity Density and we demonstrate that it\nindeed resolves both problems mentioned above. We describe the motivation for\nintroducing this metric by using intuitively clear and simple examples. We also\nprove that this new metric solves the resolution limit problem. Finally, we\ndiscuss the results of applying this metric, modularity, and several other\npopular community quality metrics to two real dynamic networks. The results\nimply that Modularity Density is consistent with all the community quality\nmeasurements but not modularity, which suggests that Modularity Density is an\nimproved measurement of the community quality compared to modularity.\n", "  We analyze the running at one-loop of the gauge couplings in the spectral\nPati-Salam model that was derived in the framework of noncommutative geometry.\nThere are a few different scenario's for the scalar particle content which are\ndetermined by the precise form of the Dirac operator for the finite\nnoncommutative space. We consider these different scenarios and establish for\nall of them unification of the Pati-Salam gauge couplings. The boundary\nconditions are set by the usual RG flow for the Standard Model couplings at an\nintermediate mass scale at which the Pati-Salam symmetry is broken.\n", "  Finite-size critical systems defined on a parallel plate geometry of finite\nextent along one single ($z$) direction with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary\nconditions at $z=0,L$ are analyzed in momentum space. We introduce a modified\nrepresentation for the discrete eigenfunctions in a renormalized one-particle\nirreducible vertex part ($1PI$) scalar field-theoretic framework using either\nmassless or massive fields. The appearance of multiplicities in the Feynman\nrules to construct diagrams due to this choice of representation of the basis\nfunctions is discussed along with the modified normalization conditions. For\nnonvanishing external quasi-momenta, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions\nare shown to be unified within a single formalism. We examine the dimensional\ncrossover regimes for these and show a correspondence with those from\nantiperiodic and periodic boundary conditions. It is demonstrated that\nfinite-size effects for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions do not\nrequire surface fields necessarily but are implemented nontrivially from the\nFeynman rules involving only bulk terms in the Lagrangian. As an application,\nthe critical exponents $\\eta$ and $\\nu$ are evaluated at least up to two-loop\nlevel through diagrammatic means. We show that the critical indices are the\nsame as those from the bulk (infinite) system irrespective of the boundary\nconditions.\n", "  Biochemical networks related to similar functional pathways are often\ncorrelated due to cross-talk among the homologous proteins in the different\nnetworks. Using a stochastic framework, we address the functional significance\nof the cross-talk between two pathways. Our theoretical analysis on generic\nMAPK pathways reveals cross-talk is responsible for developing coordinated\nfluctuations between the pathways. The extent of correlation evaluated in terms\nof the information theoretic measure provides directionality to net information\npropagation. Stochastic time series and scattered plot suggest that the\ncross-talk generates synchronization within a cell as well as in a cellular\npopulation. Depending on the number of input and output, we identify signal\nintegration and signal bifurcation motif that arise due to inter-pathway\nconnectivity in the composite network. Analysis using partial information\ndecomposition quantifies the net synergy in the information propagation through\nthese branched pathways.\n", "  Cosmological phase transitions (CPTs), such as the Grand Unified Theory (GUT)\nand the electroweak (EW) ones, play a significant role in both particle physics\nand cosmology. In this letter, we propose to probe the first-order CPTs, by\ndetecting gravitational waves (GWs) which are generated during the phase\ntransitions through the cosmic microwave background (CMB). If happened around\nthe inflation era, the first-order CPTs may yield low-frequency GWs due to\nbubble dynamics, leaving imprints on the CMB. In contrast to the nearly\nscale-invariant primordial GWs caused by vacuum fluctuation, these\nbubble-generated GWs are scale dependent and have non-trivial B-mode spectra.\nIf decoupled from inflaton, the EWPT during inflation may serve as a probe for\nthe one after reheating where the baryon asymmetry could be generated via EW\nbaryogenesis (EWBG). The CMB thus provides a potential way to test the\nfeasibility of the EWBG, complementary to the collider measurements of Higgs\npotential and the direct detection of GWs generated during EWPT.\n", "  We modify Einstein General Relativity by adding non-dynamical scalar fields\nto account simultaneously for both dark matter and dark energy. The dark energy\nin this case can be distributed in-homogeneously even within horizon scales.\nIts inhomogeneities can contribute to the late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe\neffect, possibly removing some of the low multipole anomalies in the\ntemperature fluctuations of the CMB spectrum. The presence of the inhomogeneous\ndark matter also influences structure formation in the universe.\n", "  We present a construction, rendered in Quipper, of a quantum algorithm which\nprobabilistically computes a classical function from n bits to n bits. The\nconstruction is intended to be of interest primarily for the features of\nQuipper it highlights. However, intrigued by the utility of quantum information\nprocessing in the context of neural networks, we present the algorithm as a\nsimplest example of a particular quantum neural network which we first define.\nAs the definition is inspired by recent work of Fisher concerning possible\nquantum substrates to cognition, we precede it with a short description of that\nwork.\n", "  Considering a higher dimensional Lorentz group as the tangent symmetry, we\nunify gravity and gauge interactions in a natural way. The spin connection of\nthe gauged Lorentz group is then responsible for both gravity and gauge fields,\nand the action for the gauged fields becomes part of the spin curvature\nsquared. The realistic group which unifies all known particles and interactions\nis the $SO(1,13)$ Lorentz group whose gauge part leads to $SO(10)$ grand\nunified theory and contains double the number of required fermions in the\nfundamental spinor representation. Mirror fermions could acquire mass utilizing\na mechanism employed for topological superconductors. Family unification could\nbe achieved by considering the $SO(1,21)$ Lorentz group.\n", "  With the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy marked by the aLIGO GW150914\nand GW151226 observations, a measurement of the cosmological speed of gravity\nwill likely soon be realized. We show that a confirmation of equality to the\nspeed of light as indicated by indirect Galactic observations will have\nimportant consequences for a very large class of alternative explanations of\nthe late-time accelerated expansion of our Universe. It will break the dark\ndegeneracy of self-accelerated Horndeski scalar-tensor theories in the\nlarge-scale structure that currently limits a rigorous discrimination between\nacceleration from modified gravity and from a cosmological constant or dark\nenergy. Signatures of a self-acceleration must then manifest in the linear,\nunscreened cosmological structure. We describe the minimal modification\nrequired for self-acceleration with standard gravitational-wave speed and show\nthat its maximum likelihood yields a 3-sigma poorer fit to cosmological\nobservations compared to a cosmological constant. Hence, equality between the\nspeeds challenges the concept of cosmic acceleration from a genuine\nscalar-tensor modification of gravity.\n", "  Quantum metrology promises high-precision measurements beyond the capability\nof any classical techniques, and has the potential to be integral to\ninvestigative techniques. However, all sensors must tolerate imperfections if\nthey are to be practical. Here we show that photons with perfectly overlapped\nmodes, which are therefore fully indistinguishable, are not required for\nquantum-enhanced measurement, and that partially-distinguishable photons do not\nhave to be engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of distinguishability. We\nquantify the effect of distinguishability on quantum metrology experiments, and\nreport results of an experiment to verify that two- and four-photon states\ncontaining partially-distinguishable photons can achieve quantum-enhanced\nsensitivity with low-visibility quantum interference. This demonstrates that\nsources producing photons with mixed spectral states can be readily utilized\nfor quantum metrology.\n", "  High temperature condensates found in meteorites display uranium isotopic\nvariations (235U/238U) that complicate dating of the formation of the Solar\nSystem and whose origin remains mysterious. It is possible that these\nvariations are due to decay of the short-lived radionuclide 247Cm (t1/2=15.6\nMyr) into 235U but they could also be due to uranium kinetic isotopic\nfractionation during condensation. We report uranium isotope measurements of\nmeteoritic refractory inclusions that reveal excesses of 235U reaching ~+6 %\nrelative to average solar system composition, which can only be due to decay of\n247Cm. This allows us to constrain the 247Cm/235U ratio at Solar System\nformation to (7.0 +- 1.6) x 10-5. This value provides new clues on the\nuniversality of nucleosynthetic r-process of rapid neutron capture.\n", "  We show that an interplay between quantum effects, strong on-site\nferromagnetic exchange interaction and antiferromagnetic correlations in Kondo\nlattices can give rise to an exotic spin-orbit coupled metallic state in\nregimes where classical treatments predict a trivial insulating behavior. This\nphenomenon can be simulated with ultracold alkaline-earth fermionic atoms\nsubject to a laser-induced magnetic field by observing dynamics of spin-charge\nexcitations in quench experiments.\n", "  The availability of compact, low-cost magnetic resonance imaging instruments\nwould further broaden the substantial impact of this technology. We report\nhighly sensitive detection of magnetic resonance using low-stress silicon\nnitride (SiN$_x$) membranes. We use these membranes as low-loss, high-frequency\nmechanical oscillators and find they are able to mechanically detect\nspin-dependent forces with high sensitivity enabling ultrasensitive magnetic\nresonance detection. The high force detection sensitivity stems from their high\nmechanical quality factor $Q\\sim10^6$ combined with the low mass of the\nresonator. We use this excellent mechanical force sensitivity to detect the\nelectron spin magnetic resonance using a SiN$_x$ membrane as a force detector.\nThe demonstrated force sensitivity at 300 K is 4 fN/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nindicating a potential low temperature (4 K) sensitivity of 25\naN/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$. Given their sensitivity, robust construction, large\nsurface area and low cost, SiN$_x$ membranes can potentially serve as the\ncentral component of a compact room-temperature ESR and NMR instrument that has\nsuperior spatial resolution to conventional approaches.\n", "  Stanene is a quantum spin hall insulator and a promising material for\nelectronic and optoelectronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations are performed to study the band gap opening in stanene by\nelemental mono- (B, N) and co-doping (B-N). Different patterned B-N co-doping\nis studied to change the electronic properties in stanene. A patterned B-N\nco-doping opens the band gap in stanene and the semiconducting nature persists\nwith strain. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to confirm the\nthermal stability of such doped system. The stress-strain study indicates that\nsuch doped system is as stable as pure stanene. Our work function calculations\nshow that stanene and doped stanene has lower work function than graphene and\nthus promising material for photocatalysis and electronic devices.\n", "  In the quantum logic framework we show that the no-signaling box model is a\nparticular type of tensor product of the logics of single boxes. Such notion of\ntensor product is too strong to apply in the category of logics of quantum\nmechanical systems. Consequently, we show that the no-signaling box models\ncannot be considered as generalizations of quantum mechanical models.\n", "  The presence of electron energy loss (EELS) peak is proposed theoretically in\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets. Using density functional theory\nsimulations and calculations, one EELS peak is identified in the visible energy\nrange, for MoS2 nanosheets with molybdenum vacancy. Experimentally, four\ndifferent laser sources are used for the Raman scattering study of MoS2\nnanosheets, which show two distinct Raman peaks, one at 385 cm-1 (E12g) and the\nother at 408 cm-1 (A1g). In the cases of three laser sources with wavelengths\n405 nm (3.06 eV), 632 nm (1.96 eV) and 785 nm (1.58 eV), respectively, the\nintensity of E12g Raman peak is more than the A1g Raman peak, while in the case\nof excitation source of 532 nm (2.33 eV), the intensity profile is reversed and\nA1g peak is the most intense. Thus a resonance Raman scattering phenomenon is\nobserved for 532 nm laser source.\n", "  We compute the exciton transfer (ET) rate between semiconducting single-wall\ncarbon nanotubes (SWNTs). We show that the main reasons for the wide range of\nmeasured ET rates reported in the literature are 1) exciton confinement in\nlocal quantum wells stemming from disorder in the environment and 2) exciton\nthermalization between dark and bright states due to intratube scattering. The\nSWNT excitonic states are calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nusing tight-binding basis functions. The ET rates due to intertube Coulomb\ninteraction are computed via Fermi's golden rule. In pristine samples, the ET\nrate between parallel (bundled) SWNTs of similar chirality is very high ($\\sim\n10^{14}\\;\\text{s}^{-1}$) while the ET rate for dissimilar or nonparallel tubes\nis considerably lower ($\\sim 10^{12}\\;\\text{s}^{-1}$). Exciton confinement\nreduces the ET rate between same-chirality parallel SWNTs by two orders of\nmagnitude, but has little effect otherwise. Consequently, the ET rate in most\nmeasurements will be on the order of $ 10^{12}\\;\\text{s}^{-1}$, regardless of\nthe tube relative orientation or chirality. Exciton thermalization between\nbright and dark states further reduces the ET rate to about\n$10^{11}\\;\\text{s}^{-1}$. The ET rate also increases with increasing\ntemperature and decreases with increasing dielectric constant of the\nsurrounding medium.\n", "  Uncertainties in successive measurements of general canonically conjugate\nvariables are examined. Such operators are approached within a limiting\nprocedure of the Pegg-Barnett type. Dealing with unbounded observables, we\nshould take into account a finiteness of detector resolution. An appropriate\nreformulation of two scenarios of successive measurements is proposed and\nmotivated. Uncertainties are characterized by means of generalized entropies of\nboth the R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis types. The R\\'{e}nyi and Tsallis formulations of\nuncertainty relations are obtained for both the scenarios of successive\nmeasurements of canonically conjugate operators. Entropic uncertainty relations\nfor the case of position and momentum are separately discussed.\n", "  We compare the bosonic and maximally supersymmetric membrane models. We find\nthat in Hoppe regulated form the bosonic membrane is well approximated by\nmassive Gaussian quantum matrix models. In contrast the similarly regulated\nsupersymmetric membrane, which is equivalent to the BFSS model, has a gravity\ndual description. We sketch recent progress in checking gauge/gravity duality\nin this context.\n", "  The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal is a powerful probe of the\ncosmic baryon distribution. The kSZ signal is proportional to the integrated\nfree electron momentum rather than the electron pressure (which sources the\nthermal SZ signal). Since velocities should be unbiased on large scales, the\nkSZ signal is an unbiased tracer of the large-scale electron distribution, and\nthus can be used to detect the \"missing baryon\" that evade most observational\ntechniques. While most current methods for kSZ extraction rely on the\navailability of very accurate redshifts, we revisit a method that allows\nmeasurements even in the absence of redshift information for individual\nobjects. It involves cross-correlating the square of an appropriately filtered\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature map with a projected density map\nconstructed from a sample of large-scale structure tracers. We show that this\nmethod will achieve high signal-to-noise when applied to the next generation of\nhigh-resolution CMB experiments, provided that component separation is\nsufficiently effective at removing foreground contamination. Considering\nstatistical errors only, we forecast that this estimator can yield $S/N \\approx\n$ 3, 120 and over 150 for Planck, Advanced ACTPol, and hypothetical Stage-IV\nCMB experiments, respectively, in combination with a galaxy catalog from WISE,\nand about 20% larger $S/N$ for a galaxy catalog from the proposed SPHEREx\nexperiment. This work serves as a companion paper to the first kSZ measurement\nwith this method, where we used CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck\nand WMAP data, together with galaxies from the WISE survey, to obtain a 3.8 -\n4.5$\\sigma$ detection of the kSZ$^2$ amplitude.\n", "  It has been reported in experiments that capping layers which enhance the\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)\ninduce great impact on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). To explore the\nessential influence caused by capping layers, we carry out ab initio\ncalculations on TMR in the X(001)|CoFe(001)|MgO(001)|CoFe(001)|X(001) MTJ,\nwhere X represents the capping layer material which can be tungsten, tantalum\nor hafnium. We report TMR in different MTJs and demonstrate that tungsten is an\nideal candidate for a giant TMR ratio. The transmission spectrum in Brillouin\nzone is presented. It can be seen that in the parallel condition of MTJ, sharp\ntransmission peaks appear in the minority-spin channel. This phenomenon is\nattributed to the resonant tunnel transmission effect and we explained it by\nthe layer-resolved density of states (DOS). In order to explore transport\nproperties in MTJs, the density of scattering states (DOSS) was studied from\nthe point of band symmetry. It has been found that CoFe|tungsten interface\nblocks scattering states transmission in the anti-parallel condition. This work\nreports TMR and transport properties in MTJs with different capping layers, and\nproves that tungsten is a proper capping layer material, which would benefit\nthe design and optimization of MTJs.\n", "  This is a tribute to Abdus Salam's memory whose insight and creative thinking\nset for me a role model to follow. In this contribution I show that the simple\nrequirement of volume quantization in space-time (with Euclidean signature)\nuniquely determines the geometry to be that of a noncommutative space whose\nfinite part is based on an algebra that leads to Pati-Salam grand unified\nmodels. The Standard Model corresponds to a special case where a mathematical\nconstraint (order one condition) is satisfied. This provides evidence that\nSalam was a visionary who was generations ahead of his time.\n", "  The nature of unconventional superconductivity associated with charge density\nwave order in transition metal dichalcogenides is currently a debated issue.\nStarting from a normal state elec- tronic structure followed by a charge\nordered state how superconductivity in 1T-TiSe 2 arises with applied pressure\nis still under research. A preformed excitonic liquid driven ordered state\nmediated superconductivity is found in broad class of TMD on the border of CDW.\nUsing dynamical mean field theory with input from noninteracting band structure\ncalculation, I show a superconducting phase appears near about 2 GPa pressure\nat a temperature of 2 K and this region persists upto 4 GPa Pressure.\n", "  Coherent condensates appear as emergent phenomena in many systems, sharing\nthe characteristic feature of an energy gap separating the lowest excitations\nfrom the condensate ground state. This implies that a scattering object, moving\nthrough the system with high enough velocity for the excitation spectrum in the\nscatter frame to become gapless, can create excitations at no energy cost,\ninitiating the breakdown of the condensate. This limit is the well-known Landau\nvelocity. While, for the neutral Fermionic superfluid 3He-B in the T=0 limit,\nflow around an oscillating body displays a very clear critical velocity for the\nonset of dissipation, here we show that for uniform linear motion there is no\ndiscontinuity whatsoever in the dissipation as the Landau critical velocity is\npassed and exceeded. Since the Landau velocity is such a pillar of our\nunderstanding of superfluidity, this is a considerable surprise, with\nimplications for the understanding of the dissipative effects of moving objects\nin all coherent condensate systems.\n", "  The spin gauge field formalism has been used to explain the emergence of out\nof plane spin accumulation in two-dimensional spin orbit interaction (SOI)\nsystems in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The adiabatic alignment\nof the charge carrier spins to the momentum dependent SOI field, which changes\nin time due to the electric field, can be mathematically captured by the\naddition of a gauge term in the Hamiltonian. This gauge term acts like an\neffective, electric field dependent magnetization. In this work we show that\nthis effective magnetization can be generalized to systems which include\nadditional discrete degrees of freedom to real spin, such as the pseudospin\nand/or valley degrees of freedom in emerging materials like molybdenum sulphide\nand silicene. We show that the generalized magnetization recovers key results\nfrom the Sundaram-Niu formalism as well as from the Kubo formula. We then use\nthe generalized magnetization to study the exemplary system of a topological\ninsulator thin film system where the presence of both a top as well as a bottom\nsurface provides an additional discrete degree of freedom in addition to the\nreal spin.\n", "  We study the contribution of the Higgs amplitude mode on the nonlinear\noptical response of superconductors beyond the BCS approximation by taking into\naccount the retardation effect in the phonon-mediated attractive interaction.\nTo evaluate the vertex correction in nonlinear optical susceptibilities that\ncontains the effect of collective modes, we propose an efficient scheme which\nwe call the \"dotted DMFT\" based on the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field\ntheory (nonequilibrium DMFT) to go around the difficulty of solving the\nBethe-Salpeter equation and analytical continuation. The vertex correction is\nrepresented by the derivative of the self-energy with respect to the external\ndriving field, which is self-consistently determined by the differentiated\n(\"dotted\") DMFT equations. We apply the method to the Holstein model, a\nprototypical electron-phonon-coupled system, to calculate the susceptibility\nfor the third-harmonic generation including the vertex correction. The results\nshow that, in sharp contrast to the BCS theory, the Higgs mode can contribute\nto the third-harmonic generation for general polarization of the laser field\nwith an order of magnitude comparable to the contribution from the pair\nbreaking or charge density fluctuations. The physical origin is traced back to\nthe nonlinear resonant light-Higgs coupling, which has been absent in the BCS\napproximation.\n", "  In this work, we studied time-reversal-breaking topological phases as a\nresult of the interplay between antiferromagnetism and inverted band structures\nin thin films of antiferromagnetic double perovskite transition-metal\nSr$_2$FeOsO$_6$. By combining the first-principles calculations and analytical\nmodels, we demonstrate that the quantum anomalous Hall phase and chiral\ntopological superconducting phase can be realized in this system. We find that\nto achieve time-reversal-breaking topological phases in antiferromagnetic\nmaterials, it is essential to break the combined symmetry of time reversal and\ninversion, which generally exists in antiferromagnetic structures. As a result,\nwe can utilize an external electric gate voltage to induce the phase transition\nbetween topological phases and trivial phases, thus providing an electrically\ncontrollable topological platform for the future transport experiments.\n", "  We present direct local-probe evidence for strongly hybridized\nnuclear-electronic spin states of an Ising ferromagnet LiHoF$_4$ in a\ntransverse magnetic field. The nuclear-electronic states are addressed via a\nmagnetic resonance in the GHz frequency range using coplanar resonators and a\nvector network analyzer. The magnetic resonance spectrum is successfully traced\nover the entire field-temperature phase diagram, which is remarkably well\nreproduced by mean-field calculations. Our method can be directly applied to a\nbroad class of materials containing rare-earth ions for probing the\nsubstantially mixed nature of the nuclear and electronic moments.\n", "  Rotational superradiance was predicted theoretically decades ago, and is\nchiefly responsible for a number of important effects and phenomenology in\nblack-hole physics. However, rotational superradiance has never been observed\nexperimentally. Here, with the aim of probing superradiance in the lab, we\ninvestigate the behavior of sound and surface waves in fluids resting in a\ncircular basin at the center of which a rotating cylinder is placed. We show\nthat with a suitable choice for the material of the cylinder, surface and sound\nwaves are amplified. Two types of instabilities are studied: one sets in\nwhenever superradiant modes are confined near the rotating cylinder and the\nother, which does not rely on confinement, corresponds to a local excitation of\nthe cylinder. Our findings are experimentally testable in existing fluid\nlaboratories and, hence, offer experimental exploration and comparison of\ndynamical instabilities arising from rapidly rotating boundary layers in\nastrophysical as well as in fluid dynamical systems.\n", "  A variety of two-dimensional materials possess a band structure with an\nenergy extremal ridge along a ring in momentum space. Examples are biased\nbilayer graphene, and surfaces and interfaces with a Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction where at low doping the carriers fill an annulus. This topological\nfeature causes an anomalous screening behavior, which we study using the\nThomas-Fermi theory. Specifically, reducing the doping is predicted to enhance\nthe linear screening response, while at zero doping the size of the screening\ncloud surrounding a Coulomb impurity is found to increase as the cube root of\nthe impurity charge.\n", "  Large arrays of individually controlled atoms trapped in optical tweezers are\na very promising platform for quantum engineering applications. However, to\ndate, only disordered arrays have been demonstrated, due to the\nnon-deterministic loading of the traps. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of\nfully loaded, two-dimensional arrays of up to 50 microtraps each containing a\nsingle atom, and arranged in arbitrary geometries. Starting from initially\nlarger, half-filled matrices of randomly loaded traps, we obtain user-defined\ntarget arrays at unit filling. This is achieved with a real-time control system\nand a moving optical tweezers that performs a sequence of rapid atom moves\ndepending on the initial distribution of the atoms in the arrays. These results\nopen exciting prospects for quantum engineering with neutral atoms in tunable\ngeometries.\n", "  We introduce multiforce, a force-directed layout for multiplex networks,\nwhere the nodes of the network are organized into multiple layers and both\nin-layer and inter-layer relationships among nodes are used to compute node\ncoordinates. The proposed approach generalizes existing work, providing a range\nof intermediate layouts in-between the ones produced by known methods. Our\nexperiments on real data show that multiforce can keep nodes well aligned\nacross different layers without significantly affecting their internal layouts\nwhen the layers have similar or compatible topologies. As a consequence,\nmultiforce enriches the benefits of force-directed layouts by also supporting\nthe identification of topological correspondences between layers.\n", "  We investigate the subgap spectrum and transport properties of the quantum\ndot placed on interface between metallic and superconducting leads and\nadditionally side-coupled to the edge of topological superconducting (TS)\nchain, hosting the Majorana quasiparticle. Due to chiral nature of the Majorana\nstates only one spin component, say $\\uparrow$, of the quantum dot electrons is\ndirectly hybridized with the TS wire. We study the spin-selective\ninterferometric patterns driven by the Majorana quasiparticle. The proximity\ninduced on-dot pairing effectively transmits the interference onto both spin\ncomponents, but each of them is characterized by completely different (even\nopposite) signatures. To explain their origin we confront our results with the\ntoy model, where TS chain is replaced by the usual quantum and the tunneling of\n$\\downarrow$ electrons is prohibited. We also address unique interplay of the\nMajorana and Kondo features, both appearing at zero energy.\n", "  A first measurement of the top quark mass using the decay channel t to (W to\nl nu) (b to J/psi + X to mu+ mu- + X) is presented. The analysis uses events\nselected from the proton-proton collisions recorded with the CMS detector at\nthe LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns, with 666 t t-bar and single\ntop quark candidate events containing a reconstructed J/psi candidate decaying\ninto an oppositely-charged muon pair. The mass of the (J/psi + l) system, where\nl is an electron or a muon from W boson decay, is used to extract a top quark\nmass of 173.5 +/- 3.0 (stat) +/- 0.9 (syst) GeV.\n", "  Dipolar dislocation loops, prevalent in fcc metals, are widely recognized as\ncontrolling many physical aspects of plastic deformation. We present results of\n3D dislocation dynamics simulations that shed light on the mechanisms of their\nformation, motion, interactions, and large-scale patterning. We identify two\nmain formation mechanisms, enabled by cross-slip, and show that arrays of\ndipoles can be easily formed as a result of the interaction between glide screw\ndislocations. We present a systematic analysis of the spectrum of possible\njunctions that can form as a result of mutual interaction between dipoles, and\nbetween dipoles and glide dislocations. We show that fully immobile dislocation\nsegments arise in particular cases of these interactions, leading to hardening\nand Frank-Read type sources. We reveal that the collective motion of dipolar\nloop arrays can be induced by glide dislocations in the channels of Persistent\nSlip Bands (PSB), and result in their clustering within PSB channel walls. An\nefficient tripolar drag mechanism is found to contribute to the clustering of\ndipolar loops near channel walls.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of a periodically-driven anisotropic\nKondo impurity model. The periodic time dependence is introduced for a local\nmagnetic field which couples to the impurity spin and also for an in-plane\nexchange interaction. We obtain the exact results on the time evolution for\narbitrary periodic time dependence at the special point in the parameter space\nknown as the Toulouse limit. We first consider a specific case where the local\nmagnetic field is periodically switched on and off. When the driving period is\nmuch shorter than the inverse of the Kondo temperature, an intriguing\noscillating behavior (resonance phenomenon) emerges in the time average of the\nimpurity spin polarization with increasing the local magnetic field intensity.\nBy taking the high frequency limit of the external driving, we elucidate that\nthe system recovers the translational invariance in time and can be described\nby a mixture of the zero-temperature and infinite-temperature properties. In\ncertain cases, the system is governed by either the zero-temperature or\ninfinite-temperature properties, and therefore can be properly described by the\ncorresponding equilibrium state.\n", "  The vertical drying of a colloidal film containing rod-like particles was\nstudied by means of kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The problem was\napproached using a two-dimensional square lattice and the rods were represented\nas linear $k$-mers (i.e., particles occupying $k$ adjacent sites). The initial\nstate before drying was produced using a model of random sequential adsorption\n(RSA) with isotropic orientations of the $k$-mers (orientation of the $k$-mers\nalong horizontal $x$ and vertical $y$ directions are equiprobable). In the RSA\nmodel, overlapping of the $k$-mers is forbidden. During the evaporation, an\nupper interface falls with a linear velocity of $u$ in the vertical direction\nand the $k$-mers undergo translation Brownian motion. The MC simulations were\nrun at different initial concentrations, $p_i$, ($p_i \\in [0, p_j]$, where\n$p_j$ is the jamming concentration), lengths of $k$-mers ($k \\in [1, 12]$), and\nsolvent evaporation rates, $u$. For completely dried films, the spatial\ndistributions of $k$-mers and their electrical conductivities in both $x$ and\n$y$ directions were examined. Significant evaporation-driven self-assembly and\norientation stratification of the $k$-mers oriented along the $x$ and $y$\ndirections were observed. The extent of stratification increased with\nincreasing value of $k$. The anisotropy of the electrical conductivity of the\nfilm can be finely regulated by changes in the values of $p_i$, $k$ and $u$.\n", "  Recent experiments in hybrid-quantum systems facilitate the potential\nrealization of one of the most fundamental interacting Hamiltonian-Reservoir\nsystem, namely, the single-site Bose-Hubbard model coupled to two reservoirs at\ndifferent temperatures. Using Redfield equations in Born-Markov approximation,\nwe compute non-equilibrium average particle number, energy and currents beyond\nlinear response regime, both time-dynamics and steady state and investigate its\ndependence on various tunable parameters analytically. We find interesting\nscaling laws in high temperature regimes that are independent of choice of bath\nspectral functions. We also demonstrate that the system shows very interesting\nparticle and energy current rectification properties which can be controlled\nvia the relative strength of interaction and temperatures, as well as via the\ndegree of asymmetry in system-bath coupling. Specifically, we find inversion of\ndirection of thermal rectification as a function of the relative strength of\nthe interaction strength and the temperatures. We also show that, in the limit\nof low-temperature and high interaction strength our results are consistent\nwith the non-equilibrium spin-Boson model. Our results are experimentally\nrelevant not only to hybrid quantum systems, but also in other areas such as\nmolecular junctions.\n", "  We predict a new class of three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) in\nwhich the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can more effectively generate a large band\ngap at $\\Gamma$ point. The band gap of conventional TI such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is\nmainly limited by two factors, the strength of SOC and, from electronic\nstructure perspective, the band gap when SOC is absent. While the former is an\natomic property, we find that the latter can be minimized in a generic\nrock-salt lattice model in which a stable crossing of bands {\\it at} the Fermi\nlevel along with band character inversion occurs for a range of parameters in\nthe absence of SOC. Thus, large-gap TI's or TI's comprised of lighter elements\ncan be expected. In fact, we find by performing first-principle calculations\nthat the model applies to a class of double perovskites A$_2$BiXO$_6$ (A = Ca,\nSr, Ba; X = Br, I) and the band gap is predicted up to 0.55 eV. Besides, more\ndetailed calculations considering realistic surface structure indicate that the\nDirac cones are robust against the presence of dangling bond at the boundary\nwith a specific termination.\n", "  The (001) surface of SrTiO3 were transformed from insulating to conducting\nafter Ar+ irradiation, producing a quasi two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\nThis conducting surface layer can introduce Rashba spin orbital coupling due to\nthe broken inversion symmetry normal to the plane. The spin splitting of such a\nsurface has recently been demonstrated by magneto-resistance and angular\nresolved photoemission spectra measurements. Here we present experiments\nevidencing a large spin-charge conversion at the surface. We use spin pumping\nto inject a spin current from NiFe film into the surface, and measure the\nresulting charge current. The results indicate that the Rashba effect at the\nsurface can be used for efficient charge-spin conversion, and the large\nefficiency is due to the multi-d-orbitals and surface corrugation. It holds\ngreat promise in oxide spintronics.\n", "  We study the Horizon Wavefunction (HWF) description of a generalized\nuncertainty principle inspired metric that admits sub-Planckian black holes,\nwhere the black hole mass $m$ is replaced by $M = m\\left( 1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\n\\frac{M_{\\rm Pl}^2}{m^2} \\right)$. Considering the case of a wave-packet shaped\nby a Gaussian distribution, we compute the HWF and the probability ${\\cal\n{P}}_{BH}$ that the source is a (quantum) black hole, i.e., that it lies within\nits horizon radius. The case $\\beta<0$ is qualitatively similar to the standard\nSchwarzschild case, and the general shape of ${\\cal {P}}_{BH}$ is maintained\nwhen decreasing the free parameter, but shifted to reduce the probability for\nthe particle to be a black hole accordingly. The probability grows with\nincreasing mass slowly for more negative $\\beta$, and drops to 0 for a minimum\nmass value. The scenario differs in significantly for increasing $\\beta>0$,\nwhere a minimum in ${\\cal {P}}_{BH}$ is encountered, thus meaning that every\nparticle has some probability of decaying to a black hole. Furthermore, for\nsufficiently large $\\beta$ we find that every particle is a quantum black hole,\nin agreement with the intuitive effect of increasing $\\beta$, which creates\nlarger $M$ and $R_{H}$ terms. This is likely due to a \"dimensional reduction\"\nfeature of the model, where the black hole characteristics for sub-Planckian\nblack holes mimic those in $(1+1)$-dimensions and the horizon size grows as\n$R_H \\sim M^{-1}$.\n", "  We study the melting of domain walls in the ferromagnetic phase of the\ntransverse Ising chain, created by flipping the order-parameter spins along\none-half of the chain. If the initial state is excited by a local operator in\nterms of Jordan-Wigner fermions, the resulting longitudinal magnetization\nprofiles have a universal character. Namely, after proper rescalings, the\nprofiles in the noncritical Ising chain become identical to those obtained for\na critical free-fermion chain starting from a step-like initial state. The\nrelation holds exactly in the entire ferromagnetic phase of the Ising chain and\ncan even be extended to the zero-field XY model by a duality argument. In\ncontrast, for domain-wall excitations that are highly non-local in the\nfermionic variables, the universality of the magnetization profiles is lost.\nNevertheless, for both cases we observe that the entanglement entropy\nasymptotically saturates at the ground-state value, suggesting a simple form of\nthe steady state.\n", "  We develop a consistent model for a Line Lightning Protection Device and\ndemonstrate that this model can explain the two modes of current quenching --\nimpulse quenching and current zero quenching -- observed in such devices. A\ndimensional analysis shows that impulse quenching can always be obtained if the\npower loss from the electric arcs is large enough as compared to $U_0 I_f$,\nwhere $U_0$ is the grid voltage and $I_f$ is the maximum follow current after a\nlightning strike. We further show that the two modes of quenching can be\nreproduced in a full 3D arc simulations coupled to the appropriate circuit\nmodel. This means the arc simulations can be used for optimization and\ndevelopment of future LLPDs.\n", "  The modulational instability (MI) and the evolution of weakly nonlinear\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Langmuir wave (LW) packets are studied in an unmagnetized\ncollisionless plasma with weakly relativistic electron flow. By using a 2D\nself-consistent relativistic fluid model and employing the standard\nmultiple-scale technique, a coupled set of Davey-Stewartson (DS)-like equations\nis derived which governs the slow modulation and the evolution of LW packets in\nrelativistic plasmas. It is found that the relativistic effects favor the\ninstability of LW envelopes in the k{\\theta} plane, where k is the wave number\nand {\\theta} the angle of modulation. It is also found that as the electron\nthermal velocity or {\\theta} increases, the growth rate of MI increases with\ncutoffs at higher wave numbers of modulation. Furthermore, in the nonlinear\nevolution of the DS-like equations, it is seen that with an effect of the\nrelativistic flow, a Gaussian wave beam collapses in a finite time, and the\ncollapse can be arrested when the effect of the thermal pressure or the\nrelativistic flow is slightly relaxed. The present results may be useful to the\nMI and the formation of localized LW envelopes in cosmic plasmas with a\nrelativistic flow of electrons.\n", "  The idea is to identify certain path algebra elements with symmetric\nfunctions. We propose such a morphism by solving the quiver relations, which\ndescribe the Plucker-type embedding for quiver grassmannians.\n", "  We continue our study on corrections from canonical quantum gravity to the\npower spectra of gauge-invariant inflationary scalar and tensor perturbations.\nA direct canonical quantization of a perturbed inflationary universe model is\nimplemented, which leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation. For this equation, a\nsemiclassical approximation is applied in order to obtain a Schroedinger\nequation with quantum-gravitational correction terms, from which we calculate\nthe corrections to the power spectra. We go beyond the de Sitter case discussed\nearlier and analyze our model in the first slow-roll approximation, considering\nterms linear in the slow-roll parameters. We find that the dominant correction\nterm from the de Sitter case, which leads to an enhancement of power on the\nlargest scales, gets modified by terms proportional to the slow-roll\nparameters. A correction to the tensor-to-scalar ratio is also found at second\norder in the slow-roll parameters. Making use of the available experimental\ndata, the magnitude of these quantum-gravitational corrections is estimated.\nFinally, the effects for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave\nbackground are qualitatively obtained.\n", "  The long-term dynamics of the geostationary Earth orbits (GEO) is revisited\nthrough the application of canonical perturbation theory. We consider a\nHamiltonian model accounting for all major perturbations: geopotential at order\nand degree two, lunisolar perturbations with a realistic model for the Sun and\nMoon orbits, and solar radiation pressure. The long-term dynamics of the GEO\nregion has been studied both numerically and analytically, in view of the\nrelevance of such studies to the issue of space debris or to the disposal of\nGEO satellites. Past studies focused on the orbital evolution of objects around\na nominal solution, hereafter called the forced equilibrium solution, which\nshows a particularly strong dependence on the area-to-mass ratio. Here, we i)\ngive theoretical estimates for the long-term behavior of such orbits, and ii)\nwe examine the nature of the forced equilibrium itself. In the lowest\napproximation, the forced equilibrium implies motion with a constant non-zero\naverage `forced eccentricity', as well as a constant non-zero average\ninclination, otherwise known in satellite dynamics as the inclination of the\ninvariant `Laplace plane'. Using a higher order normal form, we demonstrate\nthat this equilibrium actually represents not a point in phase space, but a\ntrajectory taking place on a lower-dimensional torus. We give analytical\nexpressions for this special trajectory, and we compare our results to those\nfound by numerical orbit propagation. We finally discuss the use of proper\nelements, i.e., approximate integrals of motion for the GEO orbits.\n", "  In an article in 2013, Caldas et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88, 023615 (2013)] derived\nanalytical expressions of the induced interaction within the scheme of Gorkov\nand Melik-Barkhudrov in quasi-two-dimensional Fermi gases with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC). They claimed that the induced interaction is exactly\nthe same as the one for the case without SOC when the SOC is weak, and in the\nregion of strong SOC, it starts from a reduced value and then recovers the\nvalue for the zero SOC in the limit of large SOC. We point out that their\ncalculations contain the critical errors and inconsistencies that significantly\naffect the basis of these claims.\n", "  Disordered hyperuniform many-particle systems have attracted considerable\nrecent attention. One important class of such systems is the classical ground\nstates of \"stealthy potentials.\" The degree of order of such ground states\ndepends on a tuning parameter. Previous studies have shown that these\nground-state point configurations can be counterintuitively disordered,\ninfinitely degenerate, and endowed with novel physical properties (e.g.,\nnegative thermal expansion behavior). In this paper, we focus on the disordered\nregime in which there is no long-range order, and control the degree of\nshort-range order. We map these stealthy disordered hyperuniform point\nconfigurations to two-phase media by circumscribing each point with a possibly\noverlapping sphere of a common radius $a$: the \"particle\" and \"void\" phases are\ntaken to be the space interior and exterior to the spheres, respectively. We\nstudy certain transport properties of these systems, including the effective\ndiffusion coefficient of point particles diffusing in the void phase as well as\nstatic and time-dependent characteristics associated with diffusion-controlled\nreactions. Besides these effective transport properties, we also investigate\nseveral related structural properties, including pore-size functions, quantizer\nerror, an order metric, and percolation threshold. We show that these\ntransport, geometrical and topological properties of our two-phase media\nderived from decorated stealthy ground states are distinctly different from\nthose of equilibrium hard-sphere systems and spatially uncorrelated overlapping\nspheres.\n", "  We show that the propositional system of a many-box model is always a\nset-representable effect algebra. In particular cases of 2-box and 1-box models\nit is an orthomodular poset and an orthomodular lattice respectively. We\ndiscuss the relation of the obtained results with the so-called Local\nOrthogonality principle. We argue that non-classical properties of box models\nare the result of a dual enrichment of the set of states caused by the\nimpoverishment of the set of propositions. On the other hand, quantum\nmechanical models always have more propositions as well as more states than the\nclassical ones. Consequently, we show that the box models cannot be considered\nas generalizations of quantum mechanical models and seeking for additional\nprinciples that could allow to \"recover quantum correlations\" in box models is,\nat least from the fundamental point of view, pointless.\n", "  The Type II seesaw model requires that its scalar doublet $H$ and triplet\n$\\Delta$ get specific patterns of VEVs $\\langle H\\rangle\\propto(0,1)^{T}$ and\n$\\langle\\Delta\\rangle\\propto(0,0,1)^{T}$ to accommodate neutrino masses.\nHowever, other types of minima could also exist in the scalar potential, which\nmay strongly contradict to experimental observations. This paper studies when\nthe minimum at $\\langle H\\rangle\\propto(0,1)^{T}$ and\n$\\langle\\Delta\\rangle\\propto(0,0,1)^{T}$ will be global and finds the necessary\nand sufficient condition for that, assuming that the lepton number violating\nterm $H^{2}\\Delta$ in the potential is perturbatively small.\n", "  A study is made of nuclear size corrections to the energy levels of\nsingle-electron atoms for the ground state of hydrogen like atoms. We consider\nFermi charge distribution to the nucleus and calculate atomic energy level\nshift due to the finite size of the nucleus in the perturbation theory context.\nThe exact relativistic correction based upon the available analytical\ncalculations is compared to the result of first-order relativistic perturbation\ntheory and the non-relativistic approximation. We find small discrepancies\nbetween our perturbative results and those obtained from exact relativistic\ncalculation even for large nuclear charge number .\n", "  The absolute brightness temperature of the Sun at millimeter wavelengths is\nan important diagnostic of the solar chromosphere. Because the Sun is so\nbright, measurement of this property usually involves the operation of\ntelescopes under extreme conditions and requires a rigorous performance\nassessment of the telescope. In this study, we establish solar observation and\ncalibration techniques at 2.6-mm wavelength for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and\nderive the absolute solar brightness temperature accurately. We tune the\nsuperconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) receiver by inducing different\nbias voltages onto the SIS mixer to prevent saturation. Then, we examine the\nlinearity of the receiver system by comparing outputs derived from different\ntuning conditions. Further, we measure the lunar filled beam efficiency of the\ntelescope using the New Moon, and then derive the absolute brightness\ntemperature of the Sun. The derived solar brightness temperature is 7700+-310 K\nat 115 GHz. The telescope beam pattern is modeled as a summation of three\nGaussian functions and derived using the solar limb. The real shape of the Sun\nis determined via deconvolution of the beam pattern from the observed map. Such\nwell-calibrated single-dish observations are important for high-resolution\nchromospheric studies because they provide the absolute temperature scale\nmissing from interferometer observations.\n", "  We investigate fundamental nonlinear dynamics of ferrofluidic Taylor-Couette\nflow - flow confined between two concentric independently rotating cylinders -\nconsider small aspect ratio by solving the ferrohydrodynamical equations,\ncarrying out systematic bifurcation analysis. Without magnetic field, we find\nsteady flow patterns, previously observed with a simple fluid, such as those\ncontaining normal one- or two vortex cells, as well as anomalous one-cell and\ntwin-cell flow states. However, when a symmetry-breaking transverse magnetic\nfield is present, all flow states exhibit stimulated, finite two-fold mode.\nVarious bifurcations between steady and unsteady states can occur,\ncorresponding to the transitions between the two-cell and one-cell states.\nWhile unsteady, axially oscillating flow states can arise, we also detect the\nemergence of new unsteady flow states. In particular, we uncover two new\nstates: one contains only the azimuthally oscillating solution in the\nconfiguration of the twin-cell flow state, and another a rotating flow state.\nTopologically, these flow states are a limit cycle and a quasiperiodic solution\non a two-torus, respectively. Emergence of new flow states in addition to\nobserved ones with classical fluid, indicates that richer but potentially more\ncontrollable dynamics in ferrofluidic flows, as such flow states depend on the\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  In this article, halfway between popularized exposition and historical\naccount, some key moments in the development of atomic theory in its beginnings\nare discussed. In particular, the events and the major discoveries that have\nhighlighted the discrete structure of the atom's energy levels are presented in\ntheir logical and chronological sequence, starting from early studies on the\ndecomposition of light by prisms until the quantum theory.\n  ---\n  In questo articolo, a met\\`a strada tra l'esposizione divulgativa e il\nresoconto storico, vengono affrontati alcuni momenti significativi dello\nsviluppo della teoria atomica ai suoi primordi. In particolare, sono\npresentati, nella loro sequenza logica e cronologica, gli avvenimenti e le\nscoperte principali che hanno messo in luce la struttura discreta dei livelli\ndi energia dell'atomo, dai primi studi sulla scomposizione della luce coi\nprismi alla teoria quantistica.\n", "  The article presents the results of the study of petroglyphs on a unique\nstone slab discovered near the kurgan 1 of the kurgan field Varvarinsky I\n(Rostov Oblast, Russia). Analysis of features of the location and style of\npetroglyph \"tree\" showed that the branches could determine semi-minor semiaxes\nm of the \"dial\" ellipses of analemmatic sundials with semi-major axis M = 24.2\ncm for medium and high (northern) latitudes up to the North Pole and \"tree\"\nmarks the direction to the North. The desire to construct a tool with which it\nwas possible to build a \"dial\" for analemmatic sundial for different latitude\nup to the latitude of the North Pole could appear under the influence of the\ndominant mythological ideas about sacred geography of the surrounding world in\nwhich the North is the World Mountain, World Tree or the abode of the gods. In\nthe article the authors conclude that the petroglyph \"tree\" on Varvarinsky slab\nmarks the direction to the North as a projection of the North Pole of the world\non the earth's surface, which simulates the slab. Petroglyph is an image of an\ninverted World Tree, when viewed from the gnomon / man. The trunk of the Tree\ncorresponds to the astronomical world axis, and its branches symbolize the\nvisible daily path of the Sun and, perhaps, the night paths of stars across the\nsky at different latitudes. During the research was carried out a comparative\nanalysis of the petroglyph \"tree\" with images of the inverted tree on the\nSrubna vessels. According to the analysis it was concluded that a mythical\nWorld Tree of Srubna population is likely to be a tree of pine family. Sign of\nthe inverted tree on the Srubna vessels has been interpreted by as a symbol of\nthe direction of the North and / or the north pole of the world; and\naccompanying signs were interpreted as symbols of circumpolar stars and\nconstellations (asterisms).\n", "  The article presents the results of a study of petroglyphs on a unique stone\nslab discovered near the kurgan 1 of the kurgan field Varvarinsky I (Rostov\nOblast, Russia). During the study was done comparing it with plates of Srubna\nburials on which were depicted the petroglyphs. Similar features for all the\nconsidered slabs are elliptically arranged wells. Groove made to Varvarinsky\nstone slab, has the same parameters as the ellipse from the wells on the slab\nof the kurgan field Tavriya -1, discovered in the Rostov region, too. With the\nhelp of astronomical methods previously been proved that elliptically located\nwells on the Srubna slabs are hour markers of analemmatic sundial. By results\nof the use of similar methods to study complex of petroglyphs on Varvarinsky\nslab, it was concluded that the slab could be used for development of the\ntechnology of markup of sundial on different geographical latitudes. Also,\nVarvarinsky slab could serve as a model example for a markup of the ellipse on\nwhich subsequently extorted wells for latitudes, close to the latitude of the\nplace of slab detection. Thus, Varvarinsky stone slab is the prototype of\nanalemmatic sundials, discovered in the Rostov and Donetsk oblasts. analemmatic\nsundial, srubna burial, slab, wells, gnomon, model sample, archaeoastronomy.\n", "  In the context of network dynamics, the complexity of systems increases\npossible evolutionary paths that often are not deterministic. Occasionally,\nsome map routs form over the course of time which guide systems towards some\nparticular states. The main intention of this study is to discover an indicator\nthat can help predict these pseudo-deterministic paths in advance. Here we\ninvestigate the dynamics of networks based on Heider balance theory that states\nthe tendency of systems towards decreasing tension. This inclination leads\nsystems to some local and global minimum tension states called \"jammed states\"\nand \"balanced states\", respectively. We show that not only paths towards jammed\nstates are not completely random but also there exist secret pseudo\ndeterministic paths that bound the system to end up in these special states.\nOur results display that the Inverse Participation Ratio method (IPR) can be a\nsuitable indicator that exhibits collective behaviors of systems. According to\nthis method, these specific paths are those that host the most participation of\nthe constituents in the system. A direct proportionality exists between the\ndistance and the selectable paths towards local minimums; where by getting\nclose to the final steps there is no other way but the one to the jammed\nstates.\n", "  In quantum gravity space and time lose their status as fundamental parts of\nthe physical reality. However, according to Kant, space and time are the a\npriori conditions of our experience. Does Kantian characterization of these\nnotions give constraints to quantum gravity, or does quantum gravity make\nKantian characterization of space and time an invalid approach? This paper\nprovides answers to these questions with a philosophical approach to quantum\ngravity.\n", "  We report that metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) molecules with a central\ncavity are able to incorporate Ag atoms from an Ag(110) surface thus creating\nsilver-phthalocyanine (AgPc). The reaction was investigated by means of\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultrahigh vacuum, and the metalation\nof \\ce{H2Pc} at the interface was confirmed with X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy. Three different kinds of molecules were found on the surface that\nare assigned to H2Pc, the corresponding dehydrogenated molecules (Pc) and AgPc.\nThe relative amounts of Pc and AgPc increase with increasing annealing\ntemperature. We suggest that the reaction with Ag atoms from the steps of the\nsurface occurs favorably only for already dehydrogenated molecules; thus, the\nmetalation of H2Pc is likely limited by the heat-induced dehydrogenation.\nDensity functional theory simulations of the reaction path are presented to\ncorroborate this hypothesis.\n", "  Given a sufficiently long bead chain in a cup, if we pull the end of the\nchain over the rim of the cup, the chain tends to continuously flow out of the\ncup, under gravity, in a common siphon process. Surprisingly enough, under\ncertain conditions, the chain forms a fountain in the air! This became known as\nthe Mould effect, after Steve Mould who discovered this phenomenon and made\nthis experiment famous on YouTube, in a video that went viral. The reason for\nthe emergence of this fountain remains unclear. This effect was shown to be due\nto an anomalous reaction force from the top of the pile of beads, a possible\norigin for this force was proposed in the same paper. Here, we describe some\nexperiments that give a contribution towards the clarification of the origin of\nthis force, and show that the explanation goes far beyond the one proposed\nbefore.\n", "  With the advances in low dimensional transition metal dichalcolgenides\n(TMDCs) based metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), the\ninterface between semiconductors and dielectrics has received considerable\nattention due to its dramatic effects on the morphology and charge transport of\nsemiconductors. In this study, first principle calculations were utilized to\ninvestigate the strain effect induced by the interface between Al2O3 (0001) and\nmonolayer MoS2. The results indicate that Al2O3 in 1.3nm thickness can apply\nthe strain of 0.3% on MoS2 monolayer. The strain effect monotonically increases\nwith the larger thickness of the dielectric layer. Also, the study on\ntemperature effect indicates the monotonic lattice expansion induced by the\nhigher temperature. Our study proposes that the dielectric engineering can be\nan effective tool for strain effect in the nanotechnology.\n", "  Using the QCD sum rules method, we estimate the mass and residues of the\nfirst radial excitations of octet baryons. The contributions coming from the\nground state baryons are eliminated by constructing the linear combinations of\nthe sum rules corresponding to different Lorentz structures. Our predictions of\nthe masses of the first radial excitations of octet baryons are in good\nagreement with the data.\n", "  Inspired by geometric engineering method, we approach qubit systems in the\ncontext of D-branes in type II superstrings. Concretely, we establish a\ncorrespondence between such quantum systems and polyvalent singularities\nappearing in local Calabi-Yau manifolds. First, we examine 1-qubit by\nconsidering a D2-brane probing the su(2) toric singularity associated with type\nIIA monovalent geometry. Then, we discuss the multi-qubits in terms of $n$\nfactors of su(2) singularities using the Cartan decomposition of non zero\nroots. Applying mirror symmetry, the 4-qubits are linked to the tetravalent\nsingularity associated with the affine \\widehat{so(8)} Lie algebra matching\nwith the ADE-correspondences in the context of quantum information theory.\nPrecisely, these states can be identified with wrapped D4-branes in a\nCalabi-Yau 4-fold near such a singularity.\n", "  Studying the structure of nucleons is not only important to understanding the\nstrong interactions of quarks and gluons, but also to improving the precision\nof new-physics searches. Since a broad class of experiments, including the LHC\nand dark-matter detection, require Standard-Model backgrounds with parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) as inputs for disentangling SM contributions from\npotential new physics. For a long time, lattice calculations of the PDFs (as\nwell as many hadron structures) has been limited to the first few moments. In\nthis talk, we present a first direct calculation of the Bjorken-x dependence of\nthe PDFs using Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). An exploratory study of\nthe antiquark/sea flavor asymmetry of these distributions will be discussed.\nThis breakthrough opens an exciting new frontier calculating more complicated\nquantities, such as gluon structure and transverse-momentum dependence, which\nwill complement existing theoretical programs for the upcoming Electron-Ion\nCollider (EIC) or Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC).\n", "  We present a sampling of analyses concerning the gender ratio of plenary\nspeakers during the years 2000--2016 and make comparisons with other\nconferences, such as the APS April meeting. We hope this will invite discussion\nof ideas for how to make our field more accessible to women and minorities. We\nare preparing for an in-depth survey of the lattice field and welcome any ideas\nor suggestions.

With the help of wealthy observation data of a squall\nline, we finally improve it by: adding a density factor to the precipitating\nice; modify the rain evaporation scheme and correct the saturation adjustment\nprocess. The improved SBU-YLIN scheme could produce a reasonable cold pool.\nSimulation of another two squall line cases in northern and eastern China\nconfirm our modifications are effective. In addition, further analysis reveals\nthat the modification of rain evaporation scheme is the most important among\nthem.\n", "  Significant successes have recently been reported in the study of the\ngeneration of spectrally pure state in group-velocity-matched (GVM) nonlinear\ncrystals. However, the GVM condition can only be realized in limited kinds of\ncrystals and at limited wavelengths. Here, we investigate pure state generation\nin the isomorphs of PPKTP crystal: i.e., periodically poled RTP, KTA, RTA and\nCTA crystals. By numerical simulation, we find that these crystals from the KTP\nfamily can generate pure photons with high spectral purity (over 0.8), wide\ntunability (more than 400 nm), reasonable nonlinearity at a variety of\nwavelengths (from 1300 nm to 2100 nm). It is also discovered that the PPCTA\ncrystal may achieve purity of 0.97 at 1506 nm. This study may provide more and\nbetter choices for quantum state engineering at telecom wavelengths.\n", "  In this proposal, we present an experimental setup based on superconducting\ncircuits and Josephson junctions to explore the modification of Josephson\ncoefficient in the presence of external magnetic field due to vacuum\npolarization of quantum electrodynamics. This robust experiment can be\nconsidered as one of the few possible chances to observe the fine quantum field\ntheory corrections in the low energy regimes in condensed matter systems. It\ncan also be a new check for the universality of Josephson constant which is\nimportant in metrology. We will expect the signal to noise ratio of the\nread-out signal to increases quadratically by running time of the experiment.\nThis characteristic of the output signal the will guarantee the feasibility of\nmeasurements with desired precision\n", "  The key role that dust plays in the interstellar medium has motivated the\ndevelopment of numerical codes designed to study the coupled evolution of dust\nand gas in systems such as turbulent molecular clouds and protoplanetary discs.\nDrift between dust and gas has proven to be important as well as numerically\nchallenging. We provide simple benchmarking problems for dusty gas codes by\nnumerically solving the two-fluid dust-gas equations for steady, plane-parallel\nshock waves. The two distinct shock solutions to these equations allow a\nnumerical code to test different forms of drag between the two fluids, the\nstrength of that drag and the dust to gas ratio. We also provide an\nastrophysical application of J-type dust-gas shocks to studying the structure\nof accretion shocks onto protoplanetary discs. We find that two-fluid effects\nare most important for grains larger than 1 um, and that the peak dust\ntemperature within an accretion shock provides a signature of the dust-to-gas\nratio of the infalling material.\n", "  Topological insulator surface properties are strongly correlated to\nstructural properties, requiring high-resolution techniques capable of probing\nboth surface and bulk structures at once. In this work, high flux of\nsynchrotron source, recursive equations for fast X-ray dynamical diffraction\nsimulation, and genetic algorithm for data fitting are combined to reveal the\ndetailed structure of bismuth telluride epitaxic films with thickness ranging\nfrom 8 to 168 nm. It includes stacking sequences, thickness and composition of\nlayers in model structures, interface coherence, surface termination and\nmorphology. These results are in agreement with the surface morphology\ndetermined by atomic force microscopy. Moreover, by using X-ray data from zero\nnoise area detector to construct three-dimensional reciprocal space maps,\ninsights into the nanostructure of domains and stacking faults in Bi2Te3 films\nare given.\n", "  The aim of this work is to investigate contrasting spectral trends observed\nin carbonaceous chondrites by simulating space weathering effects on a subset\nof minerals found in these meteorites. We use pulsed laser irradiation to\nsimulate micrometeorite impacts on aqueously altered minerals and observe their\nspectral and physical evolution as a function of irradiation time. Irradiation\nof the mineral lizardite, a Mg-phyllosilicate, produces little reddening and\ndarkening, but a pronounced reduction in band depths. Irradiation of an Fe-rich\naqueously altered mineral assemblage composed of cronstedtite, pyrite and\nsiderite, produces significant darkening and band depth suppression. The\nspectral slopes of the Fe-rich assemblage initially redden then become bluer\nwith increasing irradiation time. Analyses of the Fe-rich assemblage using\nscanning and transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of micron\nsized carbon-rich particles that contain notable fractions of nitrogen and\noxygen. Radiative transfer modeling of the Fe-rich assemblage suggests that\nnpFe0 particles result in the initial spectral reddening of the samples, but\nthe increasing production of micron sized carbon particles results in the\nsubsequent spectral bluing. The presence of npFe0 and possibly cronstedtite\nlikely promotes the synthesis of these organic-like compounds. These\nexperiments indicate that space weathering processes may enable organic\nsynthesis reactions on the surfaces of volatile-rich asteroids. Furthermore,\nMg- and Fe-rich aqueously altered minerals are dominant at different phases of\nthe alteration process. Thus, the contrasting spectral slope evolution between\nthe Fe- and Mg-rich samples in these experiments may indicate that space\nweathering trends of volatile-rich asteroids have a compositional dependency\nthat could be used to determine the aqueous histories of asteroid parent\nbodies.\n", "  We address the effects of quantum coherences on the optical line shape of an\nexciton in the presence of dynamic disorder. We consider a one-dimensional\nexcitonic system that consists of two levels placed at regular intervals.\nDetailed analytical calculations of line shape have been carried out by using\nKubo's stochastic Liouville equation (K-QSLE). We make use of the observation\nthat in the site representation, the Hamiltonian of our system with constant\noff-diagonal coupling J is a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix (TDTM) whose\neigenvalues and eigen functions are known analytically. This identification is\nparticularly useful for long chains where the eigen values of TDTM help to\nunderstand crossover between static and fast modulation limits. We summarize\nthe new results as follows. (i) In the slow modulation limit when the bath\ncorrelation time is large, the effects of spatial correlation are not\nnegligible. Here the line shape is broadened and the number of peak increases\nbeyond the ones obtained from TDTM (constant off-diagonal coupling element J\nand no fluctuation). (ii) However, in the fast modulation limit when the bath\ncorrelation time is small, the spatial correlation is less important (iii)\nImportantly, we find that the line shape can capture that quantum coherence\naffects in the two limits differently.\n", "  This is a short review of a series of papers which, in collaboration with Yue\nMa, establish several novel existence results for systems of coupled\nwave-Klein-Gordon equation. Our method, the Hyperbolic Hyperboloidal Method,\nhas allowed us to address the global evolution problem for the Einstein\nequations of general relativity and investigate the global geometry of matter\nspacetimes that are initially close to Minkowski spacetime.\n", "  We present a review of recent works on clustering phenomena in unstable\nnuclei studied by antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD). The AMD studies in\nthese decades have uncovered novel types of clustering phenomena brought about\nby the excess neutrons. Among them, this review focuses on the molecule-like\nstructure of unstable nuclei. One of the earliest discussions on the clustering\nin unstable nuclei was made for neutron-rich Be and B isotopes. AMD\ncalculations predicted that the ground state clustering is enhanced or reduced\ndepending on the number of excess neutrons. Today, the experiments are\nconfirming this prediction as the change of the proton radii. Behind this\nenhancement and reduction of the clustering, there are underlying shell effects\ncalled molecular- and atomic-orbits. These orbits form covalent and ionic\nbonding of the clusters analogous to the atomic molecules. It was found that\nthis \"molecular-orbit picture\" reasonably explains the low-lying spectra of Be\nisotopes. The molecular-orbit picture is extended to other systems having\nparity asymmetric cluster cores and to the three cluster systems. O and Ne\nisotopes are the candidates of the former, while the $3\\alpha$ linear chains in\nC isotopes are the latter. For both subjects, many intensive studies are now in\nprogress. We also pay a special attention to the observables which are the\nfingerprint of the clustering. In particular, we focus on the monopole and\ndipole transitions which are recently regarded as good probe for the\nclustering. We discuss how they have and will reveal the exotic clustering.\n", "  A new cluster type shower array NEVOD-EAS is designed for estimating the\nsize, axis position and arrival direction of extensive air showers registered\nby the Cherenkov water detector NEVOD and coordinate detector DECOR (Moscow,\nRussia). In 2015-2016, the central part of the array was deployed and started\nits operation. It includes 4 independent clusters of scintillation detector\nstations located around the NEVOD-DECOR experimental complex on the area of\nabout $10^{4} m^{2}$. This article presents the results of studying amplitude\nand timing characteristics of the array clusters which are critical for EAS\nparameters reconstruction, as well as the examples of registered events.\n", "  In this paper we derive three equations of motion for a supernova remnant\n(SNR) in the framework of the thin layer approximation using the Pad\\'e\napproximant. The circumstellar medium is assumed to follow a density profile of\neither an exponential type, a Gaussian type, or a Lane--Emden ($n=5$) type. The\nthree equations of motion are applied to four SNRs: Tycho, Cas A, Cygnus loop,\nand SN~1006. The percentage error of the Pad\\'e approximated solution is always\nless than $10\\%$. The theoretical decrease of the velocity over ten years for\nSNRs is evaluated.\n", "  Experimental complex (EC) NEVOD includes a number of unique experimental\nfacilities for studies of main components of cosmic rays on the Earth's\nsurface.

To\nextend the experimental capabilities and raising the status of the installation\nto the Mega Science level, nowadays new large-scale detectors: array for the\nEAS registration - NEVOD-EAS, detector of atmospheric neutrons - URAN, and\nlarge-area coordinate-tracking detector - TREK, are being deployed around EC\nNEVOD. The description of new detectors and a common trigger system to ensure\nthe joint operation together with other detectors of EC NEVOD are presented.\n", "  The exploration of exchange bias (EB) on the nanoscale provides a novel\napproach to improving the anisotropic properties of magnetic nanoparticles for\nprospective applications in nanospintronics and nanomedicine.

Recent advances in chemical\nsynthesis provide a unique opportunity to explore EB in a variety of iron\noxide-based nanostructures ranging from core/shell to hollow and hybrid\ncomposite nanoparticles. Experimental and atomistic Monte Carlo studies have\nshed light on the roles of interface and surface spins in these nanosystems.\nThis review paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of the EB and\nrelated phenomena in iron oxide-based nanoparticle systems, knowledge of which\nis essential to tune the anisotropic magnetic properties of exchange-coupled\nnanoparticle systems for potential applications.\n", "  The paper is devoted to the results of the EAS neutron component\ninvestigations by means of the PRISMA-32 array. The array consists of 32\nen-detectors and enables to record delayed thermal neutrons accompanying\nshowers. For registration of thermal neutrons, the scintillator based on\n$^{6}Li$ isotope as a target is used in the detectors. Some results of the\nprocessing of data accumulated over a long period of time are presented: the\nlateral distribution function of neutrons in EAS and preliminary results on EAS\nneutron multiplicity spectrum and distribution of showers in e/n ratio.\n", "  The present status of high energy cosmic ray interaction models is discussed,\nconcentrating on recent model updates inspired by the data from Run 1 of the\nLHC. A special attention is devoted to the remaining differences in the model\npredictions and their relation to the underlying theoretical approaches.\nOpportunities for the model discrimination by future LHC and cosmic ray\nexperimental studies are analyzed.\n", "  Interorganizational interactions are often complex and paradoxical. In this\nresearch, we transcend two management paradoxes: competition versus cooperation\nand open-source versus proprietary technology development. We follow the\nOpenStack open-source ecosystem where competing firms cooperate in the\njoint-development of a cloud infrastructure for big data. We provide a\nnarrative, complemented with social network visualizations, which depicts the\nevolution of cooperation and competition. Our findings suggest that development\ntransparency and weak intellectual property rights (i.e., characteristics of\nopen-source ecosystems) allow a focal firm to transfer information and\nresources more easily between multiple alliances.\n", "  Three magnetic relativistic Schr\\\"odinger operators are considered,\ncorresponding to the classical relativistic Hamiltonian symbol with both\nmagnetic vector and electric scalar potentials. Path integral representations\nfor the solutions of their respective imaginary-time relativistic Schr\\\"odinger\nequations, i.e. heat equations are given in two ways. The one is by means of\nthe probability path space measure coming from the L\\'evy process concerned,\nand the other is through time-sliced approximation with Chernoff's theorem.\n", "  The electronic structure of pentacene decorated with dipole groups\n(d-pentacene) and adsorbed onto a graphene substrate has been studied within\nthe density functional theory. Three reference configurations have been\nconsidered, namely the ideal molecule without distortions, the actual molecule\nincluding intramolecular distortions and the molecule adsorbed onto graphene.\nCalculations show a noticeable charge redistribution within the d-pentacene +\ngraphene system due to molecular distortion, as well as the formation of weak\n$\\pi$-bonds between the molecule and the substrate. Additionally, the effect of\nthe chemical modification of the terminal saturation with --H by --OH and =O is\nchecked to explore the possibility of \"levels engineering\". The imaginary part\nof the dielectric function of d-pentacene in the ideal and distorted\nconformations and the molecule adsorbed at graphene were calculated within the\nrandom phase approximation. Results show that, even though molecular\ndistortions change apreciably the absorption spectrum of isolated d-pentacene,\nthe adsorbed molecule exhibits an optical spectrum which mimics quite much that\nof single graphene.\n", "  A picture of dynamical collapse of the wave function which is relativistic\nand time symmetric is presented. The part of the model which exhibits these\nfeatures is the set of collapse outcomes. These play the role of matter\ndistributed in space and time. It is argued that the dynamically collapsing\nquantum state, which is both foliation dependent and follows a time-asymmetric\ndynamics, is not fundamental: it represents a state of information about the\npast matter distribution for the purpose of estimating the future matter\ndistribution. It is also argued from the point of view of collapse models that\nboth special and general relativistic considerations point towards a discrete\nspacetime structure and that gravity may not need to be quantised to give a\ntheory that is consistent with quantum matter.\n", "  A gamma-rigid solution of the Bohr Hamiltonian is derived for gamma=0\nutilizing the Davidson potential in the beta variable. This solution is going\nto be called X(3)-D. The energy eigenvalues and wave functions are obtained by\nusing an analytic method which has been developed by Nikiforov and Uvarov.\nBE(2) transition rates are calculated. A variational procedure is applied to\nenergy ratios to determine whether or not the X(3) model is located at the\ncritical point between spherical and deformed nuclei.\n", "  Cerebral autoregulation refers to regulation mechanisms that aim to maintain\ncerebral blood flow approximately constant. It is often assessed by\nautoregulation index (ARI), which uses arterial blood pressure and cerebral\nblood flow velocity time series to produce a ten-scale index of autoregulation\nperformance (0 denoting the absence of and 9 the strongest autoregulation).\nUnfortunately, data are rarely free from various artefacts. Here, we consider\nfour of the most common non-physiological blood pressure artefacts (saturation,\nsquare wave, reduced pulse pressure and impulse) and study their effects on ARI\nfor a range of different artefact sizes. We show that a sufficiently large\nsaturation and square wave always result in ARI reaching the maximum value of\n9. The pulse pressure reduction and impulse artefact lead to a more diverse\nbehaviour. Finally, we characterised the critical size of artefacts, defined as\nthe minimum artefact size that, on average, leads to a 10\\% deviation of ARI\n", "  The dark and bright solitons in different systems are already known in\nKlein-Gordon lattice. Instead of an external driving force, if the intrinsic\nfield is only considered, then the modal dynamics for small oscillations could\nbe characterized by the bound state in a limited range of frequency, revealed\nvia associated Legendre polynomial. Bose Einstein condensation takes place\naround bosonic particles having different wave functions within the bound\nstates in the temperature region T = 0 to Tc having implication for the\neffective mass of the system. The pairing and interplay between the dark and\nbright solitons also occur with their effect on the condensation. This\neffective mass is calculated via statistical mechanics route by two-part\npartition function that also gives an indication for the transition\ntemperature. The disappearance of the bound state after a critical frequency,\nor equivalently, after a critical temperature, gives rise to quasi-particles or\nphonons in the unbound states that propagate through the domains.\n", "  Measurements of the ARINA instrument on board the Resurs-DK1 satellite\n(altitude $\\sim$ 600 km and inclination $\\sim$ 70$^{o}$, since 2006 till 2016)\nand the VSPLESK instrument on board the International Space Station (altitude\n$\\sim$ 400 km and inclination $\\sim$ 52$^{o}$, since 2008 till 2013) in low\nEarth orbits were presented in this report. Both instruments are identical in\nterms of physical layout. They can measure high-energy protons in the range\n30-100 MeV with 10\\% energy resolution and 7$^{o}$ angular accuracy. Data\nanalysis was carried out for the total period of proton flux measurement by the\ninstruments. L-B proton distributions in the inner radiation belt (L$<$2) were\nstudied in dependence on proton energy. Geographical and pitch-angle\ndistribution of proton intensity were studied for chosen L-shells. These\ndistributions were analyzed during the decreasing part of the 23$^{rd}$ solar\ncycle and the main part of the 24$^{th}$ one.\n", "  This short exposition starts with a brief discussion of situation before the\ncompletion of special relativity (Le Verrier's discovery of the Mercury\nperihelion advance anomaly, Michelson-Morley experiment, E\\\"otv\\\"os experiment,\nNewcomb's improved observation of Mercury perihelion advance, the proposals of\nvarious new gravity theories and the development of tensor analysis and\ndifferential geometry) and accounts for the main conceptual developments\nleading to the completion of the general relativity: gravity has finite\nvelocity of propagation; energy also gravitates; Einstein proposed his\nequivalence principle and deduced the gravitational redshift; Minkowski\nformulated the special relativity in 4-dimantional spacetime and derived the\n4-dimensional electromagnetic stress-energy tensor; Einstein derived the\ngravitational deflection from his equivalence principle; Laue extended the\nMinkowski's method of constructing electromagnetic stress-energy tensor to\nstressed bodies, dust and relativistic fluids; Abraham, Einstein, and\nNordstr\\\"om proposed their versions of scalar theories of gravity in 1911-13;\nEinstein and Grossmann first used metric as the basic gravitational entity and\nproposed a \"tensor\" theory of gravity (the \"Entwurf\" theory, 1913); Einstein\nproposed a theory of gravity with Ricci tensor proportional to stress-energy\ntensor (1915); Einstein, based on 1913 Besso-Einstein collaboration, correctly\nderived the relativistic perihelion advance formula of his new theory which\nagreed with observation (1915); Hilbert discovered the Lagrangian for\nelectromagnetic stress-energy tensor and the Lagrangian for the gravitational\nfield (1915), and stated the Hilbert variational principle; Einstein equation\nof general relativity was proposed (1915); Einstein published his foundation\npaper (1916).\n", "  We give a review of truncated L$_\\infty$ algebras, as used in the study of\nhigher gauge theory. These structures are believed to hold the correct\nproperties to adequately describe gauge theory of extended objects. We discuss\nhow to construct topological higher-gauge-invariant theories and how their\nsolutions relate to multisymplectic geometries. We also show how Courant\nalgebroids fit into this formalism, so as to be able to study higher gauge\ntheory on generalized geometric bundles, i.e. on $ T\\Sigma \\oplus T^*\\Sigma $,\nfor some space-time $\\Sigma $. We will see that via this formalism we can match\nand explain a recently proposed M5-brane model, arrived at in a more heuristic\nway, whose field content seemed difficult to interpret but finds a natural\nmotivation in this framework.\n", "  The standard quantum mechanical expressions for the singlet and triplet\nsurvival probabilities and product yields of a radical pair recombination\nreaction involve a trace over the states in a combined electronic and nuclear\nspin Hilbert space. If this trace is evaluated deterministically, by performing\na separate time-dependent wavepacket calculation for each initial state in the\nHilbert space, the computational effort scales as $O(Z^2\\log Z)$, where $Z$ is\nthe total number of nuclear spin states. Here we show that the trace can also\nbe evaluated stochastically, by exploiting the properties of spin coherent\nstates. This results in a computational effort of $O(MZ\\log Z)$, where $M$ is\nthe number of Monte Carlo samples needed for convergence. Example calculations\non a strongly-coupled radical pair with $Z>10^6$ show that the singlet yield\ncan be converged to graphical accuracy using just $M=200$ samples, resulting in\na speed up by a factor of $>5000$ over a standard deterministic calculation. We\nexpect that this factor will greatly facilitate future quantum mechanical\nsimulations of a wide variety of radical pairs of interest in chemistry and\nbiology.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a future gamma-ray observatory that is\nplanned to significantly improve upon the sensitivity and precision of the\ncurrent generation of Cherenkov telescopes. The observatory will consist of\nseveral dozens of telescopes with different sizes and equipped with different\ntypes of cameras. Of these, the FlashCam camera system is the first to\nimplement a fully digital signal processing chain which allows for a traceable,\nconfigurable trigger scheme and flexible signal reconstruction. As of autumn\n2016, a prototype FlashCam camera for the medium-sized telescopes of CTA nears\ncompletion. First results of the ongoing system tests demonstrate that the\nsignal chain and the readout system surpass CTA requirements. The stability of\nthe system is shown using long-term temperature cycling.\n", "  Accurate quantum tomography is a vital tool in both fundamental and applied\nquantum science. It is a task that involves processing a noisy measurement\nrecord in order to construct a reliable estimate of an unknown quantum state,\nand is central to quantum computing, metrology, and communication. To date,\nmany different approaches to quantum state estimation have been developed, yet\nno one method fits all applications, and all fail relatively quickly as the\ndimensionality of the unknown state grows. In this work, we suggest that\nprojected gradient descent is a method that can evade some of these\nshortcomings. We present three novel tomography algorithms that use projected\ngradient descent and compare their performance with state-of-the-art\nalternatives, i.e. the diluted iterative algorithm and convex programming. Our\nresults find in favour of the general class of projected gradient descent\nmethods due to their speed, applicability to large states, and the range of\nconditions in which they perform.\n", "  Deviation of the Fast Faraday Cup signal from the longitudinal shape of the\nmeasured bunch is estimated, and a simple formula for the increase of the\nsignal rms width is suggested.\n", "  The emitted energy of electrons is calculated in relativistic strophotron. It\nis shown, that it is superposition of amplification at harmonics of main\nresonance frequency of the system.\n", "  Recently, numerical simulations of a stochastic model have shown that the\ndensity of vessel tips in tumor induced angiogenesis adopts a soliton-like\nprofile [Sci. Rep. 6, 31296 (2016)]. In this work, we derive and solve the\nequations for the soliton collective coordinates that indicate how the soliton\nadapts its shape and velocity to varying chemotaxis and diffusion. The vessel\ntip density can be reconstructed from the soliton formulas. While the\nstochastic model exhibits large fluctuations, we show that the location of the\nmaximum vessel tip density for different replicas follows closely the soliton\npeak position calculated either by ensemble averages or by solving an\nalternative deterministic description of the density. The simple soliton\ncollective coordinate equations may also be used to ascertain the response of\nthe vessel network to changes in the parameters and thus to control it.\n", "  We investigate the localization properties of gapped periodic quantum\nsystems, modeled by a periodic or covariant family of projectors, as e.g. the\northogonal projectors on the occupied orbitals at fixed crystal momentum for a\ngas of non-interacting electrons. We prove a general localization dichotomy for\ndimension $d\\leq 3$: either the system is topologically trivial i.e. all the\nChern numbers vanish, or any arbitrary choice of composite Wannier functions\nyields an infinite expectation value for the squared position operator.\nEquivalently, in the topologically non-trivial phase, the localization\nfunctional introduced by Marzari and Vanderbilt diverges, as already noticed in\nthe case of the Haldane model. Our result is formulated by using only the\nrelevant symmetries of the system, and it is thus largely model-independent.\nPossible applications include both tight-binding and continuous models of\ncrystalline solids, cold gases in optical lattices as well as flat band\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  A popular demonstration experiment in optics uses a round-bottom flask filled\nwith water to project a circular rainbow on a screen with a hole through which\nthe flask is illuminated. We show how the vessel's wall shifts the second-order\nand first-order bows towards each other and consequentially narrows down\nAlexander's dark band. We address the challenge this introduces in producing\nAlexander's dark band, and explain the importance of a sufficient distance of\nthe flask to the screen. The wall-effect also introduces a splitting of the\nbows which can easily be misinterpreted.\n", "  Bridgman CdTe and CdZnTe crystal growth, with cadmium vapor pressure control,\nis applied to production of semiconductor gamma radiation detectors. Crystals\nare highly donor doped and highly electrically conducting. Annealing in\ntellurium vapors transforms them into a highly compensated state of high\nelectrical resistance and high sensitivity to gamma radiation. N-type\ndetectors, equipped with ohmic contacts, and a grounded guard ring around the\npositive contact, are not sensitive to hole trapping. Conductivity control, by\nthe doping level, optimizes the detector operation by trade-off between\nelectrons' lifetime and electrical resistance. Gamma spectra of single\ndetectors and detector arrays are presented. Detector optimization and gamma\ndetection mechanisms are discussed.\n", "  A new representation for solutions of the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger\nequation -u\"+q(x)u=w^2u is obtained in the form of a series possessing the\nfollowing attractive feature. The truncation error is w-independent for all\nreal w. For the coefficients of the series simple recurrent integration\nformulas are obtained which make the new representation applicable for\ncomputation.\n", "  A precision measurement by AMS-02 of the positron fraction in primary cosmic\nrays is presented on this proceeding. Over the last two decades, there has been\na strong interest in the cosmic ray positron fraction which exhibit an excess\nof high energy positrons whose origin is still highly uncertain. The Alpha\nMagnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a general purpose high-energy particle\nphysics detector operational on the International Space Station since May 2011.\nDuring its unique long duration mission AMS-02 is collecting large amount of\ndata to study the behavior of cosmic ray electrons and positrons with\nunprecedented precision. This measurement shows that the positron fraction\nexhibit a rapid decrease from 1 to 8 GeV followed by a steady increase. We show\nthat above 275 GeV the positron fraction no longer exhibits an increase with\nenergy.\n", "  We prove local smoothing and weighted Strichartz estimates for the Dirac\nequation with a Aharonov-Bohm potential. The proof relies on an explicit\nrepresentation of the solution built in terms of spectral projections.\n"]}
