We used all atom\nmolecular dynamics simulations using two urea force fields and two RNA\nconstructs to elucidate in atomic detail the destabilization mechanism of\nfolded RNA in aqueous urea solutions. Urea denatures RNA by forming multiple\nhydrogen bonds with the RNA bases and has little influence on the\nphosphodiester backbone. Most significantly we discovered that urea engages in\nstacking interactions with the bases. We also estimate, for the first time,\nm-value for RNA, which is a measure of the strength of urea-RNA interactions.\nOur work provides a conceptual understanding of the mechanism by which urea\nenhances RNA folding rates.\n", "  We proposed an altered configuration for dual-frequency (DF) capacitively\ncoupled plasmas (CCP). In this configuration, two pairs of electrodes are\narranged oppositely, and the discharging is perpendicularly driven by two rf\nsources. With Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo method, we have demonstrated this\nconfiguration can remove the harmful electromagnetic and DF coupling effects in\nconventional DF-CCP.\n", "  We construct 2x2-matrix linear problems with a spectral parameter for the\nPainleve equations I-V by means of the degeneration processes from the elliptic\nlinear problem for the Painleve VI equation. These processes supplement the\nknown degeneration relations between the Painleve equations with the\ndegeneration scheme for the associated linear problems. The degeneration\nrelations constructed in this paper are based on the trigonometric, rational,\nand Inozemtsev limits.\n", "  We examined theory for force-induced unbinding on a two-dimensional free\nenergy surface where the internal dynamics of biomolecules is coupled with the\nrupture process under constant tension f. We show that only if the transition\nstate ensemble is narrow and activation barrier is high, the f-dependent\nrupture rate in the 2D potential surface can faithfully be described using an\neffective 1D energy profile.\n", "  Usually the 'hidden variables' of Bell's theorem are supposed to describe the\npair of Bell particles. Here a semantic shift is proposed, namely to attach the\nhidden variables to a stochastic medium or field in which the particles move.\nIt appears that under certain conditions one of the premises of Bell's theorem,\nnamely 'measurement independence', is not satisfied for such 'background-based'\ntheories, even if these only involve local interactions. Such theories\ntherefore do not fall under the restriction of Bell's no-go theorem. A simple\nversion of such background-based models are Ising models, which we investigate\nhere in the classical and quantum regime. We also propose to test\nbackground-based models by a straightforward extension of existing experiments.\nThe present version corrects an error in the preceding version.\n", "  It is generally believed that the resolution in digital holography is limited\nby the size of the captured holographic record. Here, we present a method to\ncircumvent this limit by self-extrapolating experimental holograms beyond the\narea that is actually captured. This is done by first padding the surroundings\nof the hologram and then conducting an iterative reconstruction procedure. The\nwavefront beyond the experimentally detected area is thus retrieved and the\nhologram reconstruction shows enhanced resolution. To demonstrate the power of\nthis concept, we apply it to simulated as well as experimental holograms.\n", "  As a consequence of the rugged landscape of RNA molecules their folding is\ndescribed by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small\nfraction ($\\phi_F$) reaches the folded state while the remaining fraction of\nmolecules is kinetically trapped in misfolded intermediates. The transition\nfrom the misfolded states to the native state can far exceed biologically\nrelevant time. Thus, RNA folding in vivo is often aided by protein cofactors,\ncalled RNA chaperones, that can rescue RNAs from a multitude of misfolded\nstructures. We consider two models, based on chemical kinetics and chemical\nmaster equation, for describing assisted folding. In the passive model,\napplicable for class I substrates, transient interactions of misfolded\nstructures with RNA chaperones alone are sufficient to destabilize the\nmisfolded structures, thus entropically lowering the barrier to folding. For\nthis mechanism to be efficient the intermediate ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex\nbetween collapsed RNA and protein cofactor should have optimal stability. We\nalso introduce an active model (suitable for stringent substrates with small\n$\\phi_F$), which accounts for the recent experimental findings on the action of\nCYT-19 on the group I intron ribozyme, showing that RNA chaperones does not\ndiscriminate between the misfolded and the native states. In the active model,\nthe RNA chaperone system utilizes chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis to\nrepeatedly bind and release misfolded and folded RNAs, resulting in substantial\nincrease of yield of the native state. The theory outlined here shows, in\naccord with experiments, that in the steady state the native state does not\nform with unit probability.\n", "  Using a standard technique sometimes (inaccurately) known as Burnside's\nLemma, it is shown that the Veldkamp space of the near hexagon L_3 times GQ(2,\n2) features 156 different types of lines. We also give an explicit description\nof each type of a line by listing the types of the three geometric hyperplanes\nit consists of and describing the properties of its core set, that is the\nsubset of points of L_3 times GQ(2, 2) shared by the three geometric\nhyperplanes in question.\n", "  Heterogeneity in biological molecules, resulting in molecule-to-molecule\nvariations in their dynamics and function, is an emerging theme. To elucidate\nthe consequences of heterogeneous behavior at the single molecule level, we\npropose an exactly solvable model in which the unfolding rate due to mechanical\nforce depends parametrically on an auxiliary variable representing an entropy\nbarrier arising from fluctuations in internal dynamics. When the rate of\nfluctuations, a measure of dynamical disorder, is comparable to or smaller than\nthe rate of force-induced unbinding, we show that there are two experimentally\nobservable consequences: non-exponential survival probability at constant\nforce, and a heavy-tailed rupture force distribution at constant loading rate.\nBy fitting our analytical expressions to data from single molecule pulling\nexperiments on proteins and DNA, we quantify the extent of disorder. We show\nthat only by analyzing data over a wide range of forces and loading rates can\nthe role of disorder due to internal dynamics be quantitatively assessed.\n", "  For decades researchers have studied the On/Off counting problem, where a\nmeasured rate consists of two parts. One due to a signal process and another\ndue to a background process, of which both magnitudes are unknown. While most\nfrequentist methods are adequate for large count numbers, they cannot be\napplied to sparse data. Here I want to present a new objective Bayesian\nsolution that only depends on three parameters: the number of events in the\nsignal region, the number of events in the background region, and the ratio of\nthe exposure for both regions. First, the probability of the hypothesis that\nthe counts are due to background only is derived analytically. Second, the\nmarginalized posterior for the signal parameter is also derived analytically.\nWith this two-step approach it is easy to calculate the signal's significance,\nstrength, uncertainty, or upper limit in a unified way. The approach is valid\nwithout restrictions for any count number including zero and may be widely\napplied in particle physics, cosmic-ray physics and high-energy astrophysics.\nIn order to demonstrate its performance I apply the method to gamma-ray burst\ndata.\n", "  Motivated by the computation of loop space quantum mechanics as indicated in\n[7], here we seek a better understanding of the tubular geometry of loop space\n${\\cal L}{\\cal M}$ corresponding to a Riemannian manifold ${\\cal M}$ around the\nsubmanifold of vanishing loops. Our approach is to first compute the tubular\nmetric of $({\\cal M}^{2N+1})_{C}$ around the diagonal submanifold, where\n$({\\cal M}^N)_{C}$ is the Cartesian product of $N$ copies of ${\\cal M}$ with a\ncyclic ordering. This gives an infinite sequence of tubular metrics such that\nthe one relevant to ${\\cal L}{\\cal M}$ can be obtained by taking the limit\n$N\\to \\infty$. Such metrics are computed by adopting an indirect method where\nthe general tubular expansion theorem of [12] is crucially used. We discuss how\nthe complete reparametrization isometry of loop space arises in the large-$N$\nlimit and verify that the corresponding Killing equation is satisfied to all\norders in tubular expansion. These tubular metrics can alternatively be\ninterpreted as some natural Riemannian metrics on certain bundles of tangent\nspaces of ${\\cal M}$ which, for ${\\cal M} \\times {\\cal M}$, is the tangent\nbundle $T{\\cal M}$.\n", "  We study the complexity of approximately evaluating the Ising and Tutte\npartition functions with complex parameters. Our results are partly motivated\nby the study of the quantum complexity classes BQP and IQP. Recent results show\nhow to encode quantum computations as evaluations of classical partition\nfunctions. These results rely on interesting and deep results about quantum\ncomputation in order to obtain hardness results about the difficulty of\n(classically) evaluating the partition functions for certain fixed parameters.\n  The motivation for this paper is to study more comprehensively the complexity\nof (classically) approximating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with\ncomplex parameters. Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and\nquantifying their approximation complexity does not require a detailed\nunderstanding of quantum computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give\nthe first full classification of the complexity of multiplicatively\napproximating the norm and additively approximating the argument of the Ising\npartition function for complex edge interactions (as well as of approximating\nthe partition function according to a natural complex metric). We also study\nthe norm approximation problem in the presence of external fields, for which we\ngive a complete dichotomy when the parameters are roots of unity. Previous\nresults were known just for a few such points, and we strengthen these results\nfrom BQP-hardness to #P-hardness. Moreover, we show that computing the sign of\nthe Tutte polynomial is #P-hard at certain points related to the simulation of\nBQP. Using our classifications, we then revisit the connections to quantum\ncomputation, drawing conclusions that are a little different from (and\nincomparable to) ones in the quantum literature, but along similar lines.\n", "  We analyze the possibility of probing anomalous Higgs couplings in the rare\ndecays $H \\to Z V$, $V$ being a vector quarkonium state. These rare decays\ninvolve both gauge as well as the Yukawa sectors and either of them can\npotentially be anomalous. We show that the branching fractions for $H \\to Z V$\ndecays in Standard Model are small, making it a sensitive probe for anomalous\nHiggs couplings originating from physics beyond Standard Model. Moreover, as\nboth $V$ and $Z$ can decay into pair of charged leptons, they provide\nexperimentally clean channels and future LHC runs should observe such decays.\nWe perform a model independent analysis and show how angular asymmetries can be\nused to probe these anomalous Higgs couplings, taking further decays of $V$ and\n$Z$ to pair of charged leptons into account. The angular asymmetries can\nprovide significant information about anomalous Higgs couplings in both gauge\nand Yukawa sectors.\n", "  The present study examines the mathematical properties of the free-free (\nf-f) matrix elements of the full electric field operator, of the multipolar\nHamiltonian. Special methods are developed and applied for their computation,\nfor the general case where the scattering wavefunctions are calculated\nnumerically in the potential of the term-dependent (N-1) electron core, and are\nenergy-normalized. It is found that, on the energy axis, the f-f matrix\nelements of the full operator have singularities of first order in the case of\nequal photoelectron energies. The numerical applications are for f-f\ntransitions in Hydrogen and Neon, obeying electric dipole and quadrupole\nselection rules. In the limit of zero photon wave-number, the full operator\nreduces to the length form of the electric dipole approximation (EDA). It is\nfound that the results for the EDA agree with those of the full operator, with\nthe exception of a photon wave-number region about the singularity.\n", "  Coarse-graining atomic displacements in a solid produces both local affine\nstrains and \"non-affine\" fluctuations. Here we study the equilibrium dynamics\nof these coarse grained quantities to obtain space-time dependent correlation\nfunctions. We show how a subset of these thermally excited, non-affine\nfluctuations act as precursors for the nucleation of lattice defects and\nsuggest how defect probabilities may be altered by an {\\it experimentally\nrealisable} \"external\" field conjugate to the global non-affinity parameter.\nOur results are amenable to verification in experiments on colloidal crystals\nusing commonly available holographic laser tweezer and video microscopy\ntechniques, and may lead to simple ways of controlling the defect density of a\ncolloidal solid.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the\nelectronic structures and band topologies of four kinds of group-V elemental\n(P, As, Sb and Bi) monolayers with buckled honeycomb structure. It is found\nthat all these monolayers can change from semiconducting to semimetallic under\ncompressive strain. If a tensile strain is however applied, the P, As and Sb\nmonolayers undergo phase transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial\nregime, whereas the topological insulating nature of Bi monolayer remains\nunchanged. With tunability of the band gaps and band topologies, it can be\nexpected that these elemental monolayers could be promising candidates for\nfuture optoelectronic and spintronic applications.\n", "  We present a new hybrid multiconfigurational method based on the concept of\nrange-separation that combines the density matrix renormalization group\napproach with density functional theory. This new method is designed for the\nsimultaneous description of dynamical and static electron-correlation effects\nin multiconfigurational electronic structure problems.\n", "  In this paper we carry out a theoretical and experimental study of the nature\nof graphene/semiconductor Schottky contact. We present a simple and\nparameter-free carrier transport model of graphene/semiconductor Schottky\ncontact derived from quantum statistical theory, which is validated by the\nquantum Landauer theory and first-principle calculations. The proposed model\ncan well explain experimental results for samples of different types of\ngraphene/semiconductor Schottky contact.\n", "  Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMPs) are the most widely studied\ncandidate particles forming the cold dark matter (CDM) whose existence can be\ninferred from a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological observations. In the\nframework of the minimal cosmological model detailed measurements on the cosmic\nmicrowave background by the PLANCK collaboration fix the scaled CDM relic\ndensity to $\\Omega_{c}h^2=0.1193\\pm0.0014$, with an error of less than 1.5%. In\norder to fully exploit this observational precision, theoretical calculations\nshould have a comparable or smaller error. In this paper we use recent lattice\nQCD calculations to improve the description of the thermal plasma. This affects\nthe predicted relic density of \"thermal WIMPs\", which once were in chemical\nequilibrium with Standard Model particles. For WIMP masses between 3 and 15\nGeV, where QCD effects are most important, our predictions differ from earlier\nresults by up to 9% (12%) for pure S-wave (P-wave) annihilation. We use these\nresults to compute the thermally averaged WIMP annihilation cross section that\nreproduces the correct CDM relic density, for WIMP masses between 0.1 GeV and\n10 TeV.\n", "  The Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) potential, defined through the\namplitude $M^4$ and width $f$ of its characteristic potential $V(\\phi) = M^4[1\n+ \\cos(\\phi/f)]$, is one of the best-suited models for the study of thawing\nquintessence. We analyze its present observational constraints by direct\nnumerical solution of the scalar field equation of motion. Observational bounds\nare obtained using Supernovae data, cosmic microwave background temperature,\npolarization and lensing data from {\\it Planck}, direct Hubble constant\nconstraints, and baryon acoustic oscillations data. We find the parameter\nranges for which PNGB quintessence gives a viable theory for dark energy. This\nexact approach is contrasted with the use of an approximate equation-of-state\nparametrization for thawing theories. We also discuss other possible\nparameterization choices, as well as commenting on the accuracy of the\nconstraints imposed by {\\it Planck} alone. Overall our analysis highlights a\nsignificant prior dependence to the outcome coming from the choice of modelling\nmethodology, which current data are not sufficient to override.\n", "  At CRYPTO 2013, Boneh and Zhandry initiated the study of quantum-secure\nencryption. They proposed first indistinguishability definitions for the\nquantum world where the actual indistinguishability only holds for classical\nmessages, and they provide arguments why it might be hard to achieve a stronger\nnotion. In this work, we show that stronger notions are achievable, where the\nindistinguishability holds for quantum superpositions of messages. We\ninvestigate exhaustively the possibilities and subtle differences in defining\nsuch a quantum indistinguishability notion for symmetric-key encryption\nschemes. We justify our stronger definition by showing its equivalence to novel\nquantum semantic-security notions that we introduce. Furthermore, we show that\nour new security definitions cannot be achieved by a large class of ciphers --\nthose which are quasi-preserving the message length. On the other hand, we\nprovide a secure construction based on quantum-resistant pseudorandom\npermutations; this construction can be used as a generic transformation for\nturning a large class of encryption schemes into quantum indistinguishable and\nhence quantum semantically secure ones. Moreover, our construction is the first\ncompletely classical encryption scheme shown to be secure against an even\nstronger notion of indistinguishability, which was previously known to be\nachievable only by using quantum messages and arbitrary quantum encryption\ncircuits.\n", "  We establish a connection between non-Markovian memory effects and\nthermodynamical quantities such as work. We show how memory effects can be\ninterpreted as revivals of work that can be extracted from a quantum system. We\nprove that non-Markovianity may allow an increase in the extractable work even\nwhen the entropy of the system is increasing. Our results have important\nimplications both in quantum thermodynamics and in quantum information theory.\nIn the former context they pave the way to the understanding of concepts like\nwork in a non-Markovian open system scenario. In the latter context they lead\nto interesting consequences for quantum state merging protocols in presence of\nnoise.\n", "  We give a detailed account of the geometric correspondence between a smooth\ncomplex projective quadric hypersurface $\\mathcal{Q}^n$ of dimension $n \\geq\n3$, and its twistor space $\\mathbb{PT}$, defined to be the space of all linear\nsubspaces of maximal dimension of $\\mathcal{Q}^n$. Viewing complex Euclidean\nspace $\\mathbb{CE}^n$ as a dense open subset of $\\mathcal{Q}^n$, we show how\nlocal foliations tangent to certain integrable holomorphic totally null\ndistributions of maximal rank on $\\mathbb{CE}^n$ can be constructed in terms of\ncomplex submanifolds of $\\mathbb{PT}$. The construction is illustrated by means\nof two examples, one involving conformal Killing spinors, the other, conformal\nKilling-Yano $2$-forms. We focus on the odd-dimensional case, and we treat the\neven-dimensional case only tangentially for comparison.\n", "  Major discrepancies have been noted for some time between fossil ages and\nmolecular divergence dates for a variety of taxa. Recently, systematic trends\nwithin avian clades have been uncovered. The trends show that the disparity is\nmuch larger for mitochondrial DNA than for nuclear DNA, also that it is larger\nfor crown fossil dates than stem fossil dates. It has been argued that this\npattern is largely inconsistent with incompleteness of the fossil record as the\nprincipal driver of the disparity. A case is presented that given the expected\nmutations from a fluctuating background of astrophysical radiation from such\nsources as supernovae, the rate of molecular clocks is variable and should\nincrease back to a few Ma, before returning to the long-term average rate. This\nis a possible explanation for the disparity. One test of this hypothesis is to\nlook for an acceleration of molecular clocks 2 to 2.5 Ma due to one or more\nmoderately nearby supernovae known to have happened at that time. Another is to\nlook for reduced disparity in benthic organisms of the deep ocean. In addition,\ndue to the importance of highly penetrating muon irradiation, the disparity\nshould be magnified for megafauna.\n", "  The multipole moments and the tidal Love numbers of neutron stars and quark\nstars satisfy certain relations which are almost insensitive to the star's\ninternal structure. A natural question is whether the same relations hold for\ndifferent compact objects and how they possibly approach the black-hole limit.\nHere we consider \"gravastars\", which are hypothetical compact objects sustained\nby their internal vacuum energy. Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form. The $I$-$\\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically\ndifferent from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is\ncontinuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the\ncompactness is maximum. Therefore, such relations can be used to discern a\ngravastar from an ordinary compact star, but not to break the degeneracy with\nthe black-hole case. Based on these results, we conjecture that the full\nmultipolar structure and the tidal deformability of a spinning, ultracompact\ngravastar are identical to those of a Kerr black hole. The approach to the\nblack-hole limit is nonpolynomial, thus differing from the critical behavior\nrecently found for strongly anisotropic neutron stars.\n", "  We study cascades on a two-layer multiplex network, with asymmetric feedback\nthat depends on the coupling strength between the layers. Based on an\nanalytical branching process approximation, we calculate the systemic risk\nmeasured by the final fraction of failed nodes on a reference layer. The\nresults are compared with the case of a single layer network that is an\naggregated representation of the two layers. We find that systemic risk in the\ntwo-layer network is smaller than in the aggregated one only if the coupling\nstrength between the two layers is small. Above a critical coupling strength,\nsystemic risk is increased because of the mutual amplification of cascades in\nthe two layers. We even observe sharp phase transitions in the cascade size\nthat are less pronounced on the aggregated layer. Our insights can be applied\nto a scenario where firms decide whether they want to split their business into\na less risky core business and a more risky subsidiary business. In most cases,\nthis may lead to a drastic increase of systemic risk, which is underestimated\nin an aggregated approach.\n", "  We report on a search for ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos from gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) in the data set collected by the Testbed station of the Askaryan\nRadio Array (ARA) in 2011 and 2012. From 57 selected GRBs, we observed no\nevents that survive our cuts, which is consistent with 0.12 expected background\nevents. Using NeuCosmA as a numerical GRB reference emission model, we estimate\nupper limits on the prompt UHE GRB neutrino fluence and quasi-diffuse flux from\n$10^{7}$ to $10^{10}$ GeV. This is the first limit on the prompt UHE GRB\nneutrino quasi-diffuse flux above $10^{7}$ GeV.\n", "  We study properties of multi-layered, interconnected networks from an\nensemble perspective, i.e. we analyze ensembles of multi-layer networks that\nshare similar aggregate characteristics. Using a diffusive process that evolves\non a multi-layer network, we analyze how the speed of diffusion depends on the\naggregate characteristics of both intra- and inter-layer connectivity. Through\na block-matrix model representing the distinct layers, we construct transition\nmatrices of random walkers on multi-layer networks, and estimate expected\nproperties of multi-layer networks using a mean-field approach. In addition, we\nquantify and explore conditions on the link topology that allow to estimate the\nensemble average by only considering aggregate statistics of the layers. Our\napproach can be used when only partial information is available, like it is\nusually the case for real-world multi-layer complex systems.\n", "  We analyze quantum state tomography in scenarios where measurements and\nstates are both constrained. States are assumed to live in a semi-algebraic\nsubset of state space and measurements are supposed to be rank-one POVMs,\npossibly with additional constraints. Specifically, we consider sets of von\nNeumann measurements and sets of local observables. We provide upper bounds on\nthe minimal number of measurement settings or outcomes that are required for\ndiscriminating all states within the given set. The bounds exploit tools from\nreal algebraic geometry and lead to generic results that do not only show the\nexistence of good measurements but guarantee that almost all measurements with\nthe same dimension characteristic perform equally well.\n  In particular, we show that on an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space any two\nstates of a semi-algebraic subset can be discriminated by $k$ generic von\nNeumann measurements if $k(n-1)$ is larger than twice the dimension of the\nsubset. In case the subset is given by states of rank at most $r$, we show that\n$k$ generic von Neumann measurements suffice to discriminate any two states\nprovided that $k(n-1)>4r(n-r)-2$. We obtain corresponding results for low-rank\nmatrix recovery of hermitian matrices in the scenario where the linear\nmeasurement mapping is induced by tight frames.\n", "  We study the stability properties of Rayleigh unstable flows both in the\npurely hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) regimes for two different\nvalues of the shear $q=2.1, 4.2$ ($q = - d\\ln\\Omega / d\\ln r$) and compare it\nwith the Keplerian case $q=1.5$. We find that the $q>2$ regime is unstable both\nin the hydrodynamic and in the MHD limit (with an initially weak magnetic\nfield). In this regime, the velocity fluctuations dominate the magnetic\nfluctuations. In contrast, in the $q<2$ (magnetorotational instability (MRI))\nregime the magnetic fluctuations dominate. This highlights two different paths\nto MHD turbulence implied by the two regimes, suggesting that in the $q>2$\nregime the instability produces primarily velocity fluctuations that cause\nmagnetic fluctuations, with the causality reversed for the $q<2$ MRI unstable\nregime. We also find that the magnetic field correlation is increasingly\nlocalized as the shear is increased in the Rayleigh unstable regime. In\ncalculating the time evolution of spatial averages of different terms in the\nMHD equations, we find that the $q>2$ regime is dominated by terms which are\nnonlinear in the fluctuations, whereas for $q<2$, the linear terms play a more\nsignificant role.\n", "  We explicitly give a frame of cardinality $5n-6$ such that every signal in\n$\\mathbb{C}^n$ can be recovered up to a phase from its associated intensity\nmeasurements via the PhaseLift approach. Furthermore, we give explicit linear\nmeasurements with $4r(n-r)+n-2r$ outcomes that enable the recovery of every\npositive semidefinite $n\\times n$ matrix of rank at most $r$.\n", "  In this paper, we have firstly proposed a new one-dimensional varied-time\nphotonic crystals, i.e., the refractive indices of media $A$ and $B$ are the\ntime functions. We consider the varied-time photonic crystals of refractive\nindices period variation and calculate the transmissivity and electronic field\ndistribution with and without defect layer, which are different from the\nconventional photonic crystals, which transmissivity and electronic field\ndistribution are static, but the varied-time photonic crystals transmissivity\nand electronic field distribution are dynamic. We have obtained some new\nresults for the varied-time photonic crystals, which should be help to design\nnew type dynamic optical devices, such as the accurate optical switch and so\non.\n", "  A relativistic wave equation for spin 1/2 particles in the Melvin space-time,\na space-time where the metric is determined by a magnectic field, is obtained.\nThe effects of very intense magnetic fields in the energy levels, as intense as\nthe ones expected to be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions,\nare investigated.\n", "  Reputation is a valuable asset in online social lives and it has drawn\nincreased attention. How to evaluate user reputation in online rating systems\nis especially significant due to the existence of spamming attacks. To address\nthis issue, so far, a variety of methods have been proposed, including\nnetwork-based methods, quality-based methods and group-based ranking method. In\nthis paper, we propose an iterative group-based ranking (IGR) method by\nintroducing an iterative reputation-allocation process into the original\ngroup-based ranking (GR) method. More specifically, users with higher\nreputation have higher weights in dominating the corresponding group sizes. The\nreputation of users and the corresponding group sizes are iteratively updated\nuntil they become stable. Results on two real data sets suggest that the\nproposed IGR method has better performance and its robustness is considerably\nimproved comparing with the original GR method. Our work highlights the\npositive role of users' grouping behavior towards a better reputation\nevaluation.\n", "  In this paper a comprehensive review is given on the current status of\nachievements in the geometric aspects of the Painlev\\'e equations, with a\nparticular emphasis on the discrete Painlev\\'e equations. The theory is\ncontrolled by the geometry of certain rational surfaces called the spaces of\ninitial values, which are characterized by eight point configuration on\n$\\mathbb{P}^1\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$ and classified according to the degeration of\npoints. We give a systematic description of the equations and their various\nproperties, such as affine Weyl group symmetries, hypergeomtric solutions and\nLax pairs under this framework, by using the language of Picard lattice and\nroot systems. We also provide with a collection of basic data; equations, point\nconfigurations/root data, Weyl group representations, Lax pairs, and\nhypergeometric solutions of all possible cases.\n", "  Recommender systems benefit us in tackling the problem of information\noverload by predicting our potential choices among diverse niche objects. So\nfar, a variety of personalized recommendation algorithms have been proposed and\nmost of them are based on similarities, such as collaborative filtering and\nmass diffusion. Here, we propose a novel vertex similarity index named CosRA,\nwhich combines advantages of both the cosine index and the resource-allocation\n(RA) index. By applying the CosRA index to real recommender systems including\nMovieLens, Netflix and RYM, we show that the CosRA-based method has better\nperformance in accuracy, diversity and novelty than some benchmark methods.\nMoreover, the CosRA index is free of parameters, which is a significant\nadvantage in real applications. Further experiments show that the introduction\nof two turnable parameters cannot remarkably improve the overall performance of\nthe CosRA index.\n", "  Building on the notion of a particle physics detector as a camera and the\ncollimated streams of high energy particles, or jets, it measures as an image,\nwe investigate the potential of machine learning techniques based on deep\nlearning architectures to identify highly boosted W bosons. Modern deep\nlearning algorithms trained on jet images can out-perform standard\nphysically-motivated feature driven approaches to jet tagging. We develop\ntechniques for visualizing how these features are learned by the network and\nwhat additional information is used to improve performance. This interplay\nbetween physically-motivated feature driven tools and supervised learning\nalgorithms is general and can be used to significantly increase the sensitivity\nto discover new particles and new forces, and gain a deeper understanding of\nthe physics within jets.\n", "  In this paper we consider an interacting Bose gas at zero temperature, in a\nfinite box and in the mean field limiting regime. The N gas particles interact\nthrough a pair potential of positive type and with an ultraviolet cut-off. Its\n(nonzero) Fourier components are sufficiently large with respect to the\ncorresponding kinetic energies of the modes. Using the multi-scale technique in\nthe occupation numbers of particle states introduced in [Pi1], we provide a\nconvergent expansion of the ground state of the particle number preserving\nBogoliubov Hamiltonian in terms of the bare operators. In the limit N \\to\n\\infty the expansion is up to any desired precision.\n", "  Reliable quantum chemical methods for the description of molecules with\ndense-lying frontier orbitals are needed in the context of many chemical\ncompounds and reactions. Here, we review developments that led to our\nnewcomputational toolbo x which implements the quantum chemical density matrix\nrenormalization group in a second-generation algorithm. We present an overview\nof the different components of this toolbox.\n", "  First results are reported on the ground state configurations of the\nneutron-rich $^{29,30}$Na isotopes, obtained via Coulomb dissociation (CD)\nmeasurements as a method of the direct probe. The invariant mass spectra of\nthose nuclei have been obtained through measurement of the four-momentum of all\ndecay products after Coulomb excitation on a $^{208}Pb$ target at energies of\n400-430 MeV/nucleon using FRS-ALADIN-LAND setup at GSI, Darmstadt. Integrated\nCoulomb-dissociation cross-sections (CD) of 89 $(7)$ mb and 167 $(13)$ mb up to\nexcitation energy of 10 MeV for one neutron removal from $^{29}$Na and\n$^{30}$Na respectively, have been extracted. The major part of one neutron\nremoval, CD cross-sections of those nuclei populate core, in its' ground state.\nA comparison with the direct breakup model, suggests the predominant occupation\nof the valence neutron in the ground state of $^{29}$Na${(3/2^+)}$ and\n$^{30}$Na${(2^+)}$ is the $d$ orbital with small contribution in the\n$s$-orbital which are coupled with ground state of the core. The ground state\nconfigurations of these nuclei are as $^{28}$Na$_{gs (1^+)\\otimes\\nu_{s,d}$ and\n$^{29}$Na$_{gs}(3/2^+)\\otimes\\nu_{ s,d}$, respectively. The ground state spin\nand parity of these nuclei, obtained from this experiment are in agreement with\nearlier reported values. The spectroscopic factors for the valence neutron\noccupying the $s$ and $d$ orbitals for these nuclei in the ground state have\nbeen extracted and reported for the first time. A comparison of the\nexperimental findings with the shell model calculation using MCSM suggests a\nlower limit of around 4.3 MeV of the sd-pf shell gap in $^{30}$Na.\n", "  We report the electrical transport properties for Weyl semimetal TaAs in an\nintense magnetic field. Series of anomalies occur in the longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance and Hall signals at ultra-low temperatures when the Weyl\nelectrons are confined into the lowest Landau level. These strongly\ntemperature-dependent anomalies are ascribed to the electron-hole pairing\ninstability. Our measurements show that the Weyl semimetal TaAs in the\nultraquantum regime provides a good platform for studying electron-electron\ninteraction in topological nontrivial semimetals.\n", "  Quantum weak measurement, measuring some observable quantities within the\nselected subensemble of the entire quantum ensemble, can produce many\ninteresting results such as the superluminal phenomena. An outcome of such a\nmeasurement is the weak value which has been applied to amplify some weak\nsignals of quantum interactions in lots of previous references. Here, we apply\nthe weak measurement to the system of relativistic cold atoms. According to\nmass-energy equivalence, the internal energy of an atom will contribute its\nrest mass and consequently the external momentum of center of mass. This\nimplies a weak coupling between the internal and external degrees of freedom of\natoms moving in the free space. After a duration of this coupling, a weak value\ncan be obtained by post-selecting an internal state of atoms. We show that, the\nweak value can change the momentum uncertainty of atoms and consequently help\nus to experimentally measure the weak effects arising from mass-energy\nequivalence.\n", "  The recent discovery of extreme magnetoresistance in LaSb introduced\nlanthanum monopnictides as a new platform to study topological semimetals\n(TSMs). In this work we report the discovery of extreme magnetoresistance in\nLaBi, confirming lanthanum monopnictides as a promising family of TSMs. These\nbinary compounds with the simple rock-salt structure are ideal model systems to\nsearch for the origin of extreme magnetoresistance. Through a comparative study\nof magnetotransport effects in LaBi and LaSb, we construct a triangular\ntemperature-field phase diagram that illustrates how a magnetic field tunes the\nelectronic behavior in these materials. We show that the triangular phase\ndiagram can be generalized to other topological semimetals with different\ncrystal structures and different chemical compositions. By comparing our\nexperimental results to band structure calculations, we suggest that extreme\nmagnetoresistance in LaBi and LaSb originates from a particular orbital texture\non their qasi-2D Fermi surfaces. The orbital texture, driven by spin-orbit\ncoupling, is likely to be a generic feature of various topological semimetals.\n", "  In the recent experiments the unusual oscillatory magnetoresistance in\nsuperconductors was discovered with a periodicity essentially independent on\nmagnetic field direction and even material parameters. The nearly universal\nperiod points to a subatomic mechanism of the phenomenon. This mechanism is\nrelated to formation inside samples of subatomically thin ($10^{-11}cm$)\nthreads in the form of rings of the interatomic radius. Electron states of\nrings go over into conduction electrons which carry the same spin imbalance in\nenergy as rings. The imbalance occurs due to spin interaction with the orbital\nmomentum of the ring. The conductivity near $T_c$ is determined by fluctuating\nCooper pairs consisting of electrons with shifted energies. Due to different\nangular momenta of rings these energies periodically depend on magnetic field\nresulting in the observed oscillatory magnetoresistance. Calculated universal\npositions of peaks $(n+1/2)\\Delta H$ ($\\Delta H\\simeq 0.18T$ and $n=0,1,2...$)\non the $R(H)$ curve are in a good agreement with experiments.\n", "  Based on laboratory based growth of plant-like structures from inorganic\nmaterials, we present new theory for the emergence of plant structure at a\nrange of scales dictated by levels of ionization (charge density), which can be\ntraced directly back to proteins transcribed from genetic code and their\ninteraction with external sources of charge (such as CO2) in real plants.\nBeyond a critical percolation threshold, individual charge induced quantum\npoten- tials (driven by dissipative systems) merge to form a complex,\ninterconnected geometric web, creating macroscopic quantum potentials, which\nlead to the emergence of macroscopic quantum processes. The assembly of\nmolecules into larger, ordered structures operates within these charge-induced\ncoherent bosonic fields, acting as a structuring force in competition with\nexterior potentials. Within these processes many of the phenomena associated\nwith standard quantum theory are recovered, including quantization,\nnon-dissipation, self-organization, confinement, structuration conditioned by\nthe environment, environmental fluctuations leading to macroscopic quantum\ndecoherence and evolutionary time described by a time dependent\nSchrodinger-like equation, which describes models of bifurcation and\nduplication. The work provides a strong case for the existence of\nquintessence-like behaviour, with macroscopic quantum potentials and associated\nforces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics and gravitational\nforces in general relativity. The theory offers new insight into evolutionary\nprocesses in structural biology, with selection at any point in time, being\nmade from a wide range of spontaneously emerging potential structures\n(dependent on conditions), which offer advantage for a specific organism. This\nis valid for both the emergence of structures from a prebiotic medium and the\nwide range of different plant structures we see today.\n", "  A measurement of the top quark pair production (t-tbar) cross section in\nproton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV is presented\nusing data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns. This analysis is performed in\nthe t-tbar decay channels with one isolated, high transverse momentum electron\nor muon and at least four jets, at least one of which is required to be\nidentified as originating from hadronization of a b quark. The calibration of\nthe jet energy scale and the efficiency of b jet identification are determined\nfrom data. The measured t-tbar cross section is 228.5 +/- 3.8 (stat) +/- 13.7\n(syst) +/- 6.0 (lumi) pb. This measurement is compared with an analysis of 7\nTeV data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns,\nto determine the ratio of 8 TeV to 7 TeV cross sections, which is found to be\n1.43 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.07 (syst) +/- 0.05 (lumi). The measurements are in\nagreement with QCD predictions up to next-to-next-to-leading order.\n", "  Isotope shifts of the 2$p_{3/2}$-2$p_{1/2}$ transition in B-like ions are\nevaluated for a wide range of the nuclear charge number: Z=8-92. The\ncalculations of the relativistic nuclear recoil and nuclear size effects are\nperformed using a large scale configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm\nmethod. The corresponding QED corrections are also taken into account. The\nresults of the calculations are compared with the theoretical values obtained\nwith other methods. The accuracy of the isotope shifts of the\n2$p_{3/2}$-2$p_{1/2}$ transition in B-like ions is significantly improved.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the calibration of radio interferometers in\nwhich Jones matrices are considered to model the interaction between the\nincident electromagnetic field and the antennas of each station. Specifically,\nperturbation effects are introduced along the signal path, leading to the\nconversion of the plane wave into an electric voltage by the receptor. In order\nto design a robust estimator, the noise is assumed to follow a spherically\ninvariant random process (SIRP). The derived algorithm is based on an iterative\nrelaxed concentrated maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), for which closed-form\nexpressions are obtained for most of the unknown parameters.\n", "  A prediction of the standard LCDM cosmology is that dark matter (DM) halos\nare teeming with numerous self-bound substructure, or subhalos. The precise\nproperties of these subhalos represent important probes of the underlying\ncosmological model. We use data from Via Lactea II and ELVIS N-body simulations\nto learn about the structure of subhalos with masses 1e6 - 1e11 Msun/h. Thanks\nto a superb subhalo statistics, we study subhalo properties as a function of\ndistance to host halo center and subhalo mass, and provide a set of fits that\naccurately describe the subhalo structure. We also investigate the role of\nsubhalos on the search for DM annihilation. Previous work has shown that\nsubhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos significantly.\nYet, these works traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar structural\nproperties than those of field halos, while it is known that subhalos are more\nconcentrated. Building upon our N-body data analysis, we refine the\nsubstructure boost model of Sanchez-Conde & Prada (2014), and find boosts that\nare a factor 2-3 higher. We further refine the model to include unavoidable\ntidal stripping effects on the subhalo population. For field halos, this\nintroduces a moderate 20-30% suppression. Yet, for subhalos like those hosting\ndwarf galaxy satellites, tidal stripping plays a critical role, the boost being\nat the level of a few tens of percent at most. We provide a parametrization of\nthe boost for field halos that can be safely applied over a wide halo mass\nrange.\n", "  We present a general construction of non-Gaussian probability measures on the\nspace of distributional kernels obeying a natural extension of the\nOsterwalder-Schrader axioms of Euclidean quantum field theory in arbitrary\nspace-time dimension $d$. These measures may be interpreted as corresponding to\nscalar massive quantum fields with polynomial self-interaction. As a\nconsequence, we obtain examples of non-free models satisfying the Haag-Kastler\naxioms of algebraic quantum field theory for arbitrary $d$. When $d<4$ we are\nable to transfer the measures to the space of distributions and verify the\nstandard Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, hence, by a well-known reconstruction\ntheorem, we also obtain quantum field theory models satisfying the axioms of\nWightman.\n", "  We present some practical guidelines for software implementations of the\nmeta-structure project introduced in previous contributions. The purpose of the\nmeta-structure project is to implement models not only to detect, but also to\ninduce, change and maintain properties acquired by collective behaviours. We\nconsider the simplified case given by simulated collective behaviours where all\nthe microscopic spatial information (x, y, z) for each interacting agent per\ninstant are available ex-post in a suitable file. In particular, we introduce\nguidelines to identify suitable mesoscopic variables (clusters) and\nmeta-structural properties suitable for representing coherence of collective\nbehaviours to be also used to induce coherence in non-coherent Brownian\nbehaviours. Furthermore, on the basis of previous contributions which studied\nin real flocks properties related to topological distances as topological\nranges of interaction and scale invariance, here we introduce some comments and\nproposals to be further studied and implemented for network models of\ncollective behaviours.\n  Keywords: Cluster, Coherence, Ergodicity, Mesoscopic, Meta-Structure,\nNetwork, Threshold.\n", "  A search for dark matter particles directly produced in proton-proton\ncollisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC is presented. The data\ncorrespond to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 inverse femtobarns, at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The event selection requires at least two jets\nand no isolated leptons. The razor variables are used to quantify the\ntransverse momentum balance in the jet momenta. The study is performed\nseparately for events with and without jets originating from b quarks. The\nobserved yields are consistent with the expected backgrounds and, depending on\nthe nature of the production mechanism, dark matter production at the LHC is\nexcluded at 90% confidence level for a mediator mass scale Lambda below 1 TeV.\nThe use of razor variables yields results that complement those previously\npublished.\n", "  We consider adaptive change of diet of a predator population that switches\nits feeding between two prey populations. We develop a novel 1 fast--3 slow\ndynamical system to describe the dynamics of the three populations amidst\ncontinuous but rapid evolution of the predator's diet choice. The two extremes\nat which the predator's diet is composed solely of one prey correspond to two\nbranches of the three-branch critical manifold of the fast--slow system. By\ncalculating the points at which there is a fast transition between these two\nfeeding choices (i.e., branches of the critical manifold), we prove that the\nsystem has a two-parameter family of periodic orbits for sufficiently large\nseparation of the time scales between the evolutionary and ecological dynamics.\nUsing numerical simulations, we show that these periodic orbits exist, and that\ntheir phase difference and oscillation patterns persist, when ecological and\nevolutionary interactions occur on comparable time scales. Our model also\nexhibits periodic orbits that agree qualitatively with oscillation patterns\nobserved in experimental studies of the coupling between rapid evolution and\necological interactions.\n", "  We perform a threshold resummation calculation for the associated production\nof gluinos and gauginos at the LHC to the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.\nAnalytical results are presented for the process-dependent soft anomalous\ndimension and the hard function. The resummed results are matched to a full\nnext-to-leading order calculation, for which we have generalised the previously\nknown results to the case of supersymmetric scenarios featuring non-universal\nsquark masses. Numerically, the next-to-leading logarithmic contributions\nincrease the total next-to-leading order cross section by 7 to 20% for central\nscale choices and gluino masses of 3 to 6 TeV, respectively, and reduce its\nscale dependence typically from up to $\\pm12$% to below $\\pm3$%.\n", "  We show how bond order emerges due to light mediated synthetic interactions\nin ultracold atoms in optical lattices in an optical cavity. This is a\nconsequence of the competition between both short- and long-range interactions\ndesigned by choosing the optical geometry. Light induces effective many-body\ninteractions that modify the landscape of quantum phases supported by the\ntypical Bose-Hubbard model. Using exact diagonalization of small system sizes\nin one dimension, we present the many-body quantum phases the system can\nsupport via the interplay between the density and bond (or matter-wave\ncoherence) interactions. We find numerical evidence to support that dimer\nphases due to bond order are analogous to valence bond states. Different\npossibilities of light-induced atomic interactions are considered that go\nbeyond the typical atomic system with dipolar and other intrinsic interactions.\nThis will broaden the Hamiltonian toolbox available for quantum simulation of\ncondensed matter physics via atomic systems.\n", "  A one-parameter generalization of the hierarchy of negative flows is\nintroduced for integrable hierarchies of evolution equations, which yields a\nwider (new) class of non-evolutionary integrable nonlinear wave equations. As\nmain results, several integrability properties of these generalized negative\nflow equation are established, including their symmetry structure, conservation\nlaws, and bi-Hamiltonian formulation. (The results also apply to the hierarchy\nof ordinary negative flows). The first generalized negative flow equation is\nworked out explicitly for each of the following integrable equations: Burgers,\nKorteweg-de Vries, modified Korteweg-de Vries, Sawada-Kotera, Kaup-Kupershmidt,\nKupershmidt.\n", "  We apply the recently developed dual fermion algorithm for disordered\ninteracting systems to the Anderson-Hubbard model. This algorithm is compared\nwith dynamical cluster approximation calculations for a one-dimensional system\nto establish the quality of the approximation in comparison with an established\ncluster method. We continue with a three-dimensional (3d) system and look at\nthe antiferromagnetic, Mott and Anderson localization transitions. The dual\nfermion approach leads to quantitative as well as qualitative improvement of\nthe dynamical mean-field results and it allows one to calculate the hysteresis\nin the double occupancy in 3d taking into account nonlocal correlations.\n", "  The polarizable embedding (PE) approach is a flexible embedding model where a\npre-selected region out of a larger system is described quantum mechanically\nwhile the interaction with the surrounding environment is modeled through an\neffective operator. This effective operator represents the environment by\natom-centered multipoles and polarizabilities derived from quantum mechanical\ncalculations on (fragments of) the environment. Thereby, the polarization of\nthe environment is explicitly accounted for. Here, we present the coupling of\nthe PE approach with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). This\nPE-DMRG method is particularly suitable for embedded subsystems that feature a\ndense manifold of frontier orbitals which requires large active spaces.\nRecovering such static electron-correlation effects in multiconfigurational\nelectronic structure problems, while accounting for both electrostatics and\npolarization of a surrounding environment, allows us to describe strongly\ncorrelated electronic structures in complex molecular environments. We\ninvestigate various embedding potentials for the well-studied first excited\nstate of water with active spaces that correspond to a full\nconfiguration-interaction treatment. Moreover, we study the environment effect\non the first excited state of a retinylidene Schiff base within a\nchannelrhodopsin protein. For this system, we also investigate the effect of\ndynamical correlation included through short-range density functional theory.\n", "  We have constructed a microwave detector based on the voltage switching of an\nunderdamped Josephson junction, that is positioned at a current antinode of a\n{\\lambda}/4 coplanar waveguide resonator. By measuring the switching current\nand the transmission through a waveguide capacitively coupled to the resonator\nat different drive frequencies and temperatures we are able to fully\ncharacterize the system and assess its detection efficiency and sensitivity.\nTesting the detector by applying a classical microwave field with the strength\nof a single photon yielded a sensitivity parameter of 0.5 in qualitative\nagreement with theoretical calculations.\n", "  We consider quantum state tomography with measurement procedures of the\nfollowing type: First, we subject the quantum state we aim to identify to a\nknow time evolution for a desired period of time. Afterwards we perform a\nmeasurement with a fixed measurement set-up. This procedure can then be\nrepeated for other periods of time, the measurement set-up however remains\nunaltered. Given an $n$-dimensional system with suitable unitary dynamics, we\nshow that any two states can be discriminated by performing a measurement with\na set-up that has $n$ outcomes at $n+1$ points in time. Furthermore, we\nconsider scenarios where prior information restricts the set of states to a\nsubset of lower dimensionality. Given an $n$-dimensional system with suitable\nunitary dynamics and a semi-algebraic subset $\\mathcal{R}$ of its state space,\nwe show that any two states of the subset can be discriminated by performing a\nmeasurement with a set-up that has $n$ outcomes at $l$ steps of the time\nevolution if $(n-1)l\\ge 2\\dim\\mathcal{R}$. In addition, by going beyond unitary\ndynamics, we show that one can in fact reduce to a set-up with the minimal\nnumber of two outcomes.\n", "  We report the effect of Ni doping on superconductivity of FeSe0.5Te0.5. The\nsingle crystal samples of series Fe1-xNixSe0.5Te0.5 (x=0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05,\n0.07, 0.10 and 0.20) are synthesized via vacuum shield solid state reaction\nroute and high temperature heating followed by slow cooling. All the crystals\nof Fe1-xNixSe0.5Te0.5 series with x up to 0.20, i.e., 20% substitution of Ni at\nFe site are crystallized in single phase tetragonal structure with space group\nP4/nmm. The electrical resistivity measurements revealed that Tc decreases fast\nwith increase of Ni concentration in Fe1-xNixSe0.5Te0.5. Namely the\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) being defined as resistivity =0\ndecrease from 12K to around 4K and 2K for x=0.01 and 0.03 samples respectively.\nFor x=0.05 (5at% Ni at Fe site) though Tconset is observed in resistivity\nmeasurements but \\r{ho}=0 is not seen down to 2K. For x more than 0.07, neither\nthe Tconset nor Tc\\r{ho}=0 is seen down 2K in R-T measurements. It is\ndemonstrated that Ni doping at Fe site in FeSe0.5Te0.5 superconductor\nsuppresses superconductivity fast. The rate of Tc depression is albeit non\nmonotonic. Summarily, a systematic study on suppression of superconductivity\nwith Fe site Ni doping in flux free gown FeSe0.5Te0.5 single crystals is\npresented in the current communication.\n", "  Studies of dark matter lie at the interface of collider physics, astrophysics\nand cosmology. Constraining models featuring dark matter candidates entails the\ncapability to provide accurate predictions for large sets of observables and\ncompare them to a wide spectrum of data. We present a framework which, starting\nfrom a model lagrangian, allows one to consistently and systematically make\npredictions, as well as to confront those predictions with a multitude of\nexperimental results. As an application, we consider a class of simplified dark\nmatter models where a scalar mediator couples only to the top quark and a\nfermionic dark sector (i.e. the simplified top-philic dark matter model). We\nstudy in detail the complementarity of relic density, direct/indirect detection\nand collider searches in constraining the multi-dimensional model parameter\nspace, and efficiently identify regions where individual approaches to dark\nmatter detection provide the most stringent bounds. In the context of collider\nstudies of dark matter, we point out the complementarity of LHC searches in\nprobing different regions of the model parameter space with final states\ninvolving top quarks, photons, jets and/or missing energy. Our study of dark\nmatter production at the LHC goes beyond the tree-level approximation and we\nshow examples of how higher-order corrections to dark matter production\nprocesses can affect the interpretation of the experimental results.\n", "  We put forward the idea that all the theoretically consistent models of\ngravity have contributions to the observed gravity interaction. In this\nformulation, each model comes with its own Euclidean path-integral weight where\ngeneral relativity (GR) has automatically the maximum weight in high-curvature\nregions. We employ this idea in the framework of Lovelock models and show that\nin four dimensions the result is a specific form of the $f(R,G)$ model. This\nspecific $f(R,G)$ satisfies the stability conditions and possesses\nself-accelerating solutions. Our model is consistent with the local tests of\ngravity since its behavior is the same as in GR for the high-curvature regime.\nIn the low-curvature regime the gravitational force is weaker than in GR, which\ncan be interpreted as the existence of a repulsive fifth force for very large\nscales. Interestingly, there is an intermediate-curvature regime where the\ngravitational force is stronger in our model compared to GR. The different\nbehavior of our model in comparison with GR in both low- and\nintermediate-curvature regimes makes it observationally distinguishable from\n$\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  We apply the technique of spinfoam to study the space-time which,\nclassically, contains a curvature singularity. We derive from the full\ncovariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) that the region near curvature singularity\nhas to be of strong quantum gravity effect. We show that the spinfoam\nconfiguration describing the near-singularity region has to be of small spins\n$j$, in order that its contribution to the full spinfoam amplitude is\nnontrivial. The spinfoams in low and high curvature regions of the space-time\nmay be viewed as in two different {phases} of covariant LQG. There should be a\nphase transition as the space-time described by spinfoam becomes more and more\ncurved. A candidate of order parameter is proposed for understanding the phase\ntransition. Moreover, we also analyze the spin-spin correlation function of\nspinfoam, and show the correlation is of long-range in the low curvature phase.\nThis work is a first step toward understanding the physics of black hole and\nearly universe from the full covariant LQG theory.\n", "  The pulsed radiation from the Crab pulsar consists of the main pulse (MP) and\ninter pulse (IP), as well as of the extra pulse components appearing at certain\nfrequencies. It has been studied at many frequencies and contains unique\ninformation, which is not available for the majority of the pulsars. One of the\nmysteries of these data, found by Moffett and Hankins twenty years ago, is the\nshift of the IP at high radio frequencies compared to lower ones and return to\nits previous position in the more high-frequency optical and X-ray range. We\npropose the explanation of these mysterious changes with the frequency through\nreflection of radiation by relativistic positrons from the star surface. The\nmagnetic field of the pulsar in the pole must be inclined to the surface of the\nstar and affects on the discussed processes. The positrons, which are\naccelerated towards the surface of the star by the inner gap electric field,\nradiate as half-bare particles. The spectral-angular properties of this\nradiation differ from those ones of the electron curvature radiation inside the\ngap.\n", "  With the help of information and communication technologies, studies on the\noverall social networks have been extensively reported recently. However,\ninvestigations on the directed Ego Communication Networks (ECNs) remain\ninsufficient, where an ECN stands for a sub network composed of a centralized\nindividual and his/her direct contacts. In this paper, the directed ECNs are\nbuilt on the Call Detail Records (CDRs), which cover more than 7 million people\nof a provincial capital city in China for half a year. Results show that there\nis a critical size for ECN at about 150, above which the average emotional\ncloseness between ego and alters drops, the balanced relationship between ego\nand network collapses, and the proportion of strong ties decreases. This paper\nnot only demonstrate the significance of ECN size in affecting its properties,\nbut also shows accordance with the \"Dunbar's Number\". These results can be\nviewed as a cross-culture supportive evidence to the well-known Social Brain\nHypothesis (SBH).\n", "  The discovery of iron pnictides and iron chalcogenides as a new class of\nunconventional superconductors in 2008 has generated an enourmous amount of\nexperimental and theoretical work that identifies these materials as correlated\nmetals with multiorbital physics, where magnetism, nematicity and\nsuperconductivity are competing phases that appear as a function of pressure\nand doping. A microscopic understanding of the appearance of these phases is\ncrucial in order to determine the nature of superconductivity in these systems.\nHere we review our recent theoretical efforts to describe and understand from\nfirst principles the properties of iron pnictides and chalcogenides with\nspecial focus on (i) pressure dependence, (ii) effects of electronic\ncorrelation and (iii) origin of magnetism and superconductivity.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse a theory of modified gravity, in which the\nfield content of general relativity will be increased to include a vector\nfield. We will use the Horndeski formalism to non-minimally couple this vector\nfield to the metric. As we will be using the Horndeski formalism, this theory\nwill not contain Ostrogradsky ghost degree of freedom. We will analyse compact\nstars using this Vector-Tensor-Horndeski theory.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditional security in data\ncommunication and is currently being deployed in commercial applications.\nNonetheless, before QKD can be widely adopted, it faces a number of important\nchallenges such as secret key rate, distance, size, cost and practical\nsecurity. Here, we survey those key challenges and the approaches that are\ncurrently being taken to address them.\n", "  Nanopores made with low dimensional semiconducting materials, such as carbon\nnanotubes and graphene slit pores, are used in supercapacitors. In theories and\nsimulations of their operation, it is often assumed that such pores screen\nion-ion interactions like metallic pores, i.e. that screening leads to an\nexponential decay of the interaction potential with ion separation. By\nintroducing a quantum capacitance that accounts for the density of states in\nthe material, we show that ion-ion interactions in carbon nanotubes and\ngraphene slit pores actually decay algebraically with ion separation. This\nresult suggests a new avenue of capacitance optimization based on tuning the\nelectronic structure of a pore: a marked enhancement in capacitance might be\nachieved by developing nanopores made with metallic materials or bulk\nsemimetallic materials.\n", "  We establish the precise relation between the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS)\nquantization scheme and Grassi-Hatsuda-Marino conjecture for the mirror curve\nof arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau threefold. For a mirror curve of genus $g$, the\nNS quantization scheme leads to $g$ quantization conditions for the\ncorresponding integrable system. The exact NS quantization conditions enjoy a\nself S-duality with respect to Planck constant $\\hbar$ and can be derived from\nthe Lockhart-Vafa partition function of nonperturbative topological string.\nBased on a recent observation on the correspondence between spectral theory and\ntopological string, another quantization scheme was proposed by\nGrassi-Hatsuda-Marino, in which there is a single quantization condition and\nthe spectra are encoded in the vanishing of a quantum Riemann theta function.\nWe demonstrate that there actually exist at least $g$ nonequivalent quantum\nRiemann theta functions and the intersections of their theta divisors coincide\nwith the spectra determined by the exact NS quantization conditions. This\nhighly nontrivial coincidence between the two quantization schemes requires\ninfinite constraints among the refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants. The\nequivalence for mirror curves of genus one has been verified for some local del\nPezzo surfaces. In this paper, we generalize the correspondence to higher\ngenus, and analyze in detail the resolved $\\mathbb{C}^3/\\mathbb{Z}_5$ orbifold\nand several $SU(N)$ geometries. We also give a proof for some models at\n$\\hbar=2\\pi/k$.\n", "  We report flux free growth of superconducting FeSe single crystals by an easy\nand versatile high temperature melt and slow cooling method for first time. The\nroom temperature XRD on the surface of the piece of such obtained crystals\nshowed single 101 plane of Beta-FeSe tetragonal phase. The bulk powder XRD,\nbeing obtained by crushing the part of crystal chunk showed majority tetragonal\nand minority FeSe hexagonal crystalline phases. Detailed HRTEM images along\nwith SAED (selected area electron diffraction) showed the abundance of both\nmajority and minority FeSe phases. Both transport (RT) and magnetization (MT)\nexhibited superconductivity at below around 10K. Interestingly, the\nmagnetization signal of these crystals is dominated by the magnetism of\nminority magnetic phase, and hence the isothermal magnetization (MH) at 4K was\nseen to be ferromagnetic (FM) like. Transport (R-T) measurements under magnetic\nfield showed superconductivity onset at below 12K, and R = 0 (Tc) at 9K.\nSuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) decreases with applied field to\naround 6K at 7Tesla, with dTc/dH of 0.4K/Tesla, giving rise to an Hc2 value of\naround 50 Tesla, 30 Tesla and 20 Tesla for Rn = 90, 50 and 10 percent\nrespectively. FeSe single crystal activation energy is calculated from\nThermally Activated Flux Flow (TAFF) model which is found to decreases with\nfield.\n", "  Quantum tunneling dominates coherent transport at low temperatures in many\nsystems of great interest. In this work we report a many--body tunneling (MBT),\nby nonperturbatively solving the Anderson multi-impurity model, and identify it\na fundamental tunneling process on top of the well--acknowledged sequential\ntunneling and cotunneling. We show that the MBT involves the dynamics of\ndoublons in strongly correlated systems. Proportional to the numbers of\ndynamical doublons, the MBT can dominate the off--resonant transport in the\nstrongly correlated regime. A $T^{3/2}$--dependence of the MBT current on\ntemperature is uncovered and can be identified as a fingerprint of the MBT in\nexperiments. We also prove that the MBT can support the coherent long--range\ntunneling of doublons, which is well consistent with recent experiments on\nultracold atoms. As a fundamental physical process, the MBT is expected to play\nimportant roles in general quantum systems.\n", "  We report superconductivity in as synthesized Nb2PdSe5, which is similar to\nrecently discovered Nb2PdS5 compound having very high upper critical field,\nclearly above the Pauli paramagnetic limit [Sci. Rep. 3, 1446 (2013)]. A bulk\npolycrystalline Nb2PdSe5 sample is synthesized by solid state reaction route in\nphase pure structure. The structural characterization has been done by X ray\ndiffraction, followed by Rietveld refinements, which revealed that Nb2PdSe5\nsample is crystallized in monoclinic structure with in space group C2/m.\nStructural analysis revealed the formation of sharing of one dimensional PdSe2\nchains. Electrical and magnetic measurements confirmed superconductivity in\nNb2PdSe5 compound at 5.5K. Detailed magneto-resistance results, exhibited the\nvalue of upper critical field to be around 8.2Tesla. The estimated Hc2(0) is\nwithin Pauli Paramagnetic limit, which is unlike the Nb2PdS5.\n", "  We consider a superconducting qubit coupled to the nonstationary transmission\nline cavity with modulated frequency taking into account energy dissipation.\nPreviously, it was demonstrated that in the case of a single nonadiabatical\nmodulation of a cavity frequency there are two channels of a two-level system\nexcitation which are due to the absorption of Casimir photons and due to the\ncounterrotating wave processes responsible for the dynamical Lamb effect. We\nshow that the parametric periodical modulation of the resonator frequency can\nincrease dramatically the excitation probability. Remarkably, counterrotating\nwave processes under such a modulation start to play an important role even in\nthe resonant regime. Our predictions can be used to control qubit-resonator\nquantum states as well as to study experimentally different channels of a\nparametric qubit excitation.\n", "  We present a nucleus-dependent valence-space approach for calculating ground\nand excited states of nuclei, which generalizes the shell-model in-medium\nsimilarity renormalization group to an ensemble reference with fractionally\nfilled orbitals. Because the ensemble is used only as a reference, and not to\nrepresent physical states, no symmetry restoration is required. This allows us\nto capture 3N forces among valence nucleons with a valence-space Hamiltonian\nspecifically targeted to each nucleus of interest. Predicted ground-state\nenergies from carbon through nickel agree with results of other large-space ab\ninitio methods, generally to the 1\\% level. In addition, we show that this new\napproach is required in order to obtain convergence for nuclei in the upper $p$\nand $sd$ shells. Finally, we address the $1^+$/$3^+$ ground-state inversion\nproblem in $^{22}\\text{Na}$ and $^{46}\\text{V}$. This approach extends the\nreach of ab initio nuclear structure calculations to essentially all light- and\nmedium-mass nuclei.\n", "  Techniques for coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy have been\ndeveloped and utilised to understand many different processes, including energy\ntransfer in photosynthesis and many-body effects in semiconductor\nnanostructures. Double-quantum 2D spectroscopy is one variation that has been\nparticularly useful for understanding many-body effects. In condensed matter\nsystems, however, there are often many competing signal pathways, which can\nmake it difficult to isolate different contributions and retrieve quantitative\ninformation. Here, a means of separating overlapping pathways while maintaining\nthe fidelity of the relevant peak/s is demonstrated. This selective approach is\nused to isolate the double-quantum signal from a mixed two exciton state in a\nsemiconductor quantum well. The removal of overlapping peaks allows analysis of\nthe relevant peak-shape and thus details of interactions with the environment\nand other carriers to be revealed. An alternative pulse ordering identifies a\ndouble-quantum state associated only with GaAs defects, the signature of which\nhas previously been confused with other interaction induced effects. The\nexperimental approach described here provides access to otherwise hidden\ndetails of excitonic interactions and demonstrates that the manner in which the\ndouble-quantum coherence is generated can be important and provide an\nadditional control to help understand the many-body physics in complex systems.\n", "  We study the problem of detecting a structured, low-rank signal matrix\ncorrupted with additive Gaussian noise. This includes clustering in a Gaussian\nmixture model, sparse PCA, and submatrix localization. Each of these problems\nis conjectured to exhibit a sharp information-theoretic threshold, below which\nthe signal is too weak for any algorithm to detect. We derive upper and lower\nbounds on these thresholds by applying the first and second moment methods to\nthe likelihood ratio between these \"planted models\" and null models where the\nsignal matrix is zero. Our bounds differ by at most a factor of root two when\nthe rank is large (in the clustering and submatrix localization problems, when\nthe number of clusters or blocks is large) or the signal matrix is very sparse.\nMoreover, our upper bounds show that for each of these problems there is a\nsignificant regime where reliable detection is information- theoretically\npossible but where known algorithms such as PCA fail completely, since the\nspectrum of the observed matrix is uninformative. This regime is analogous to\nthe conjectured 'hard but detectable' regime for community detection in sparse\ngraphs.\n", "  We present new relations for scattering amplitudes of color ordered gluons\nand gravitons in Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. Tree-level amplitudes of arbitrary\nmultiplicities and polarizations involving up to three gravitons and up to two\ncolor traces are reduced to partial amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills theory. In\nfact, the double-trace identities apply to Einstein-Yang-Mills extended by a\ndilaton and a B-field. Our results generalize recent work of Stieberger and\nTaylor for the single graviton case with a single color trace. As the\nderivation is made in the dimension-agnostic Cachazo-He-Yuan formalism, our\nresults are valid for external bosons in any number of spacetime dimensions.\nMoreover, they generalize to the superamplitudes in theories with 16\nsupercharges.\n", "  A high power pulsed laser system has been installed on the high magnetic\nfield muon spectrometer (HiFi) at the ISIS pulsed neutron and muon source,\nsituated at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. The upgrade\nenables one to perform light-pump muon-probe experiments under a high magnetic\nfield, which opens new applications of muon spin spectroscopy. In this report\nwe give an overview of the principle of the HiFi Laser system, and describe the\nnewly developed techniques and devices that enable precisely controlled\nphotoexcitation of samples in the muon instrument. A demonstration experiment\nillustrates the potential of this unique combination of the photoexcited system\nand avoided level crossing technique.\n", "  We suggest a scalar singlet extension of the standard model, in which the\nmultiple-point principle (MPP) condition of a vanishing Higgs potential at the\nPlanck scale is realized. Although there have been lots of attempts to realize\nthe MPP at the Planck scale, the realization with keeping naturalness is quite\ndifficult. Our model can easily achieve the MPP at the Planck scale without\nlarge Higgs mass corrections. It is worth noting that the electroweak symmetry\ncan be radiatively broken in our model. In the naturalness point of view, the\nsinglet scalar mass should be of ${\\cal O}(1)\\,{\\rm TeV}$ or less. We also\nconsider right-handed neutrino extension of the model for neutrino mass\ngeneration. The model does not affect the MPP scenario, and might keep the\nnaturalness with the new particle mass scale beyond TeV, thanks to accidental\ncancellation of Higgs mass corrections.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the critical properties of a single\ndriven-dissipative nonlinear photon mode. In a well-defined thermodynamical\nlimit of large excitation numbers, the exact quantum solution describes a\nfirst-order phase transition in the regime where semiclassical theory predicts\noptical bistability. We study the behavior of the complex spectral gap\nassociated with the Liouvillian superoperator of the corresponding master\nequation. We show that in this limit the Liouvillian gap vanishes exponentially\nand that the bimodality of the photon Wigner function disappears. The\nconnection between the considered thermodynamical limit of large photon numbers\nfor the single-mode cavity and the thermodynamical limit of many cavities for a\ndriven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard system is discussed.\n", "  We report on temperature dependence of the infrared reflectivity spectra of a\nsingle crystalline herbertsmithite in two polarizations --- parallel and\nperpendicular to the kagome plane of Cu atoms. We observe anomalous broadening\nof the low frequency phonons possibly caused by fluctuations in the exotic\ndynamical magnetic order of the spin liquid.\n", "  Here we perform a series of time-resolved experiments where a 100 fs pump\npulse is tuned between 528 nm and 555 nm, across the second indirect gap of\nintrinsic silicon at ~540 nm which involves electrons in a higher-lying\nconduction band with minimum at the L point. The photo-injected carriers, after\ninter- and intra-band relaxations are complete, are subsequently probed with\nhigh-field single-cycle terahertz radiation. When the energy of the pump pulses\nexceeds the second indirect gap, the probed terahertz absorption decreases by a\nfactor 2.7$\\pm$0.2. We suggest that this dramatic change could be due to the\ndifferent phonon populations obtained when the carriers undergo the L to X\ninter-band scattering, instead of just cooling within the X-valley.\n", "  The mass assembly history of the Milky Way can inform both theory of galaxy\nformation and the underlying cosmological model. Thus, observational\nconstraints on the properties of both its baryonic and dark matter contents are\nsought. Here we show that hypervelocity stars (HVSs) can in principle provide\nsuch constraints. We model the observed velocity distribution of HVSs, produced\nby tidal break-up of stellar binaries caused by Sgr A*. Considering a Galactic\nCentre (GC) binary population consistent with that inferred in more\nobservationally accessible regions, a fit to current HVS data with significance\nlevel > 5\\% can only be obtained if the escape velocity from the GC to 50 kpc\nis $V_G < 850$ km/s, regardless of the enclosed mass distribution. When a NFW\nmatter density profile for the dark matter halo is assumed, haloes with $V_G <\n850$ km/s are in agreement with predictions in the $\\Lambda$CDM model and that\na subset of models around $M_{200} \\sim 0.5-1.5 \\times 10^{12}$ solar masses\nand $r_s < 35$ kpc can also reproduce Galactic circular velocity data. HVS data\nalone cannot currently exclude potentials with $V_G > 850$ km/s. Finally,\nspecific constraints on the halo mass from HVS data are highly dependent on the\nassumed baryonic mass potentials. This first attempt to simultaneously\nconstrain GC and dark halo properties is primarily hampered by the paucity and\nquality of data. It nevertheless demonstrates the potential of our method, that\nmay be fully realised with the ESA Gaia mission.\n", "  There exist well motivated models of particle dark matter which predominantly\nscatter inelastically off nuclei in direct detection experiments. This\ninelastic transition causes the DM to up-scatter in terrestrial experiments\ninto an excited state up to 550 keV heavier than the DM itself. An inelastic\ntransition of this size is highly suppressed by both kinematics and nuclear\nform factors. We extend previous studies of inelastic DM to determine the\npresent bounds on the scattering cross section, and the prospects for\nimprovements in sensitivity. Three scenarios provide illustrative examples:\nnearly pure Higgsino DM; magnetic inelastic DM; and inelastic models with dark\nphoton exchange. We determine the elastic scattering rate as well as verify\nthat exothermic transitions are negligible. Presently, the strongest bounds on\nthe cross section are from xenon at LUX-PandaX (\\delta < 160 keV), iodine at\nPICO (160 < \\delta < 300 keV), and tungsten at CRESST (when \\delta > 300 keV).\nAmusingly, once \\delta > 200 keV, weak scale (and larger) DM - nucleon\nscattering cross sections are allowed. The relative competitiveness of these\nexperiments is governed by the upper bound on the recoil energies employed by\neach experiment, as well as strong sensitivity to the mass of the heaviest\nelement in the detector. Several implications, including sizable recoil\nenergy-dependent annual modulation, and improvements for future experiments are\ndiscussed. We show that the xenon experiments can improve on the PICO results,\nif they were to analyze their existing data over a larger range of recoil\nenergies, i.e., 20-500 keV. We also speculate about several reported events at\nCRESST between 45-100 keV, that could be interpreted as inelastic DM\nscattering. Future data from PICO, CRESST and xenon experiments can test this\nwith anaylses of high energy recoil data.\n", "  We propose a generator of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) which, unlike\nspasers or plasmon lasers, does not require stimulated emission in the system.\nIts principle of operation is based on a positive feedback which a classical\noscillating dipole experiences from a reflective surface located in its near\nfield. The generator design includes a nanocavity between two metal surfaces\nwhich contains metal nanoparticles in its interior. The whole structure is\nplaced onto a prism surface that allows one to detect the generated SPPs in the\nKretschmann configuration. The generation process is driven by a moderate\nconstant voltage applied between the metal covers of the cavity. Both the\ngeneration criterion and the steady-state operation of the generator are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The checkerboard lattice, with alternating 'crossed' plaquettes, serves as\nthe two dimensional analog of the pyrochlore lattice. The corner sharing\nplaquette structure leads to a hugely degenerate ground state, and no magnetic\norder, for classical spins with short range antiferromagnetic interaction. For\nthe half-filled Hubbard model on this structure, however, we find that the Mott\ninsulating phase involves virtual electronic processes that generate longer\nrange and multispin couplings. These couplings lift the degeneracy, selecting a\n'flux like' state in the Mott insulator. Increasing temperature leads,\nstrangely, to a sharp crossover from this state to a '120 degree' correlated\nstate and then a paramagnet. Decrease in the Hubbard repulsion drives the\nsystem towards an insulator-metal transition - the moments reduce, and a spin\ndisordered state wins over the flux state. Near the insulator-metal transition\nthe electron system displays a pseudogap extending over a large temperature\nwindow.\n", "  We demonstrate four and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells\nwith ideally matched bandgaps. We develop an infrared absorbing 1.2eV bandgap\nperovskite, $FA_{0.75}Cs_{0.25}Sn_{0.5}Pb_{0.5}I_3$, that can deliver 14.8 %\nefficiency. By combining this material with a wider bandgap\n$FA_{0.83}Cs_{0.17}Pb(I_{0.5}Br_{0.5})_3$ material, we reach monolithic two\nterminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0 % with over 1.65 volts open-circuit\nvoltage. We also make mechanically stacked four terminal tandem cells and\nobtain 20.3 % efficiency. Crucially, we find that our infrared absorbing\nperovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability,\nunprecedented for Sn based perovskites. This device architecture and materials\nset will enable 'all perovskite' thin film solar cells to reach the highest\nefficiencies in the long term at the lowest costs.\n", "  We demonstrate that quantum-critical spin dynamics can be probed in high\nmagnetic fields using muon-spin relaxation ($\\mu^{+}$SR). Our model system is\nthe strong-leg spin ladder bis(2,3-dimethylpyridinium) tetrabromocuprate\n(DIMPY). In the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase we observe\nfinite-temperature scaling of the $\\mu^{+}$SR $1/T_1$ relaxation rate which\nallows us to determine the Luttinger parameter $K$. We discuss the benefits and\nlimitations of local probes compared with inelastic neutron scattering.\n", "  We review recent theoretical developments, which suggest that a set of shared\nprinciples underpin macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in high temperature\nsuper conducting materials, room temperature coherence in photosynthetic\nprocesses and the emergence of long range order in biological structures. These\nsystems are driven by dissipative systems, which lead to fractal assembly and a\nfractal network of charges (with associated quantum potentials) at the\nmolecular scale. At critical levels of charge density and fractal dimension,\nindividual quantum potentials merge to form a charged induced macroscopic\nquantum potential, which act as a structuring force dictating long range order.\nWhilst the system is only partially coherent (i.e. only the bosonic fields are\ncoherent), within these processes many of the phenomena associated with\nstandard quantum theory are recovered, with macroscopic quantum potentials and\nassociated forces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics. We\nestablish a testable hypothesis that the development of structures analogous to\nthose found in biological systems, which exhibit macroscopic quantum\nproperties, should lead to increased critical temperatures in high temperature\nsuperconducting materials. If the theory is confirmed it opens up a new,\nsystematic, ab initio approach to the structural development of these types of\nmaterials.\n", "  We report on a search for host galaxies of a subset of Rotating Radio\nTransients (RRATs) that possess a dispersion measure (DM) near or above the\nmaximum Galactic value in their direction. These RRATs could have an\nextragalactic origin and therefore be Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The sizes of\nrelated galaxies on the sky at such short distances are comparable to the beam\nsize of a single-dish telescope (for example, the $7.0'$ radius of the Parkes\nbeam). Hence the association, if found, could be more definitive as compared to\nfinding host galaxies for more distant FRBs. We did not find any host galaxy\nassociated with six RRATs near the maximum Galactic DM. This result is\nconsistent with the fact that the probability of finding an FRB host galaxy\nwithin this volume is also very small. We propose that future follow-up\nobservations of such RRATs be carried out in searching for local host galaxies\nas well as the sources of FRBs.\n", "  We construct the holographic dictionary for both running and constant dilaton\nsolutions of the 2D Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory obtained by a circle\nreduction from 3D gravity with negative cosmological constant. This specific\nmodel ensures that the dual theory has a well defined ultraviolet completion in\nterms of a 2D CFT, but our results apply qualitatively to a wider class of 2D\ndilaton gravity theories. For each type of solutions we perform holographic\nrenormalization, compute the exact renormalized one-point functions in the\npresence of arbitrary sources, and derive the asymptotic symmetries and\nconserved charges. In both cases we find that the scalar operator dual to the\ndilaton plays a crucial role in the description of the dynamics. Its source\ngives rise to a matter conformal anomaly for the running dilaton solutions,\nwhile its expectation value is the only non trivial observable for constant\ndilaton solutions. The role of this operator has been largely overlooked in the\nliterature. We further show that the only non trivial conserved charges for\nrunning dilaton solutions are the mass and the electric charge, while for\nconstant dilaton solutions only the electric charge is non zero. However, by\nuplifting the solutions to three dimensions we show that constant dilaton\nsolutions can support non trivial extended symmetry algebras, including the one\nfound by Comp\\`ere, Song and Strominger, in agreement with results by Castro\nand Song. Finally, we demonstrate that any solution of this specific dilaton\ngravity model can be uplifted to a family of asymptotically AdS$_2\\times S^2$\nor conformally AdS$_2\\times S^2$ solutions of the STU model in four dimensions.\nThe four dimensional solutions obtained by uplifting the running dilaton\nsolutions coincide with the so called `subtracted geometries', while those\nobtained from the uplift of the constant dilaton ones are new.\n", "  We have developed a model in which the quantum fluctuations of the proton\nstructure are characterised by hot spots, whose number grows with decreasing\nBjorken-$x$. Our model reproduces the $F_2(x,Q^2)$ data from HERA at the\nrelevant scale, as well as the exclusive and dissociative $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$\nphotoproduction data from H1 and ALICE. Our model predicts that for\n$W_{\\gamma\\mathrm{p}} \\approx 500$ GeV, the dissociative $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$\ncross section reaches a maximum and then decreases steeply with energy, which\nis in qualitatively good agreement to a recent observation that the\ndissociative $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$ background in the exclusive $\\mathrm{J/}\\psi$\nsample measured in photoproduction by ALICE decreases as energy increases. Our\nprediction provides a clear signature for gluon saturation at LHC energies.\n", "  We present a subset of experimental results on charge fluctuation from the\nheavy-ion collisions to search for phase transition and location of critical\npoint in the QCD phase diagram. Measurements from the heavy-ion experiments at\nthe SPS and RHIC energies observe that total charge fluctuations increase from\ncentral to peripheral collisions. The net-charge fluctuations in terms of\ndynamical fluctuation measure $\\nu_{(+-,dyn)}$ are studied as a function of\ncollision energy (\\sqsn) and centrality of the collisions. The product of\n$\\nu_{(+-,dyn)}$ and $\\langle N_{ch} \\rangle$ shows a monotonic decrease with\ncollision energies, which indicates that at LHC energy the fluctuations have\ntheir origin in the QGP phase. The fluctuations in terms of higher moments of\nnet-proton, net-electric charge and net-kaon have been measured for various\n\\sqsn. Deviations are observed in both $S\\sigma$ and $\\kappa\\sigma^2$ for\nnet-proton multiplicity distributions from the Skellam and hadron resonance gas\nmodel for \\sqsn $<$ 39 GeV. Higher moment results of the net-electric charge\nand net-kaon do not observe any significant non-monotonic behavior as a\nfunction of collision energy. We also discuss the extraction of the freeze-out\nparameters using particle ratios and experimentally measured higher moments of\nnet-charge fluctuations. The extracted freeze-out parameters from\nexperimentally measured moments and lattice calculations, are found to be in\nagreement with the results obtained from the fit of particle ratios to the\nthermal model calculations.\n", "  Current thermoelectric (TE) materials often have low performance or contain\nless abundant and/or toxic elements, thus limiting their large-scale\napplications. Therefore, new TE materials with high efficiency and low cost are\nstrongly desirable. Here we demonstrate that, SiS and SiSe monolayers made from\nnon-toxic and earth-abundant elements intrinsically have low thermal\nconductivities arising from their low-frequency optical phonon branches with\nlarge overlaps with acoustic phonon modes, which is similar to the\nstate-of-the-art experimentally demonstrated material SnSe with a layered\nstructure. Together with high thermal power factors due to their\ntwo-dimensional nature, they show promising TE performances with large figure\nof merit (ZT) values exceeding 1 or 2 over a wide range of temperatures. We\nestablish some basic understanding of identifying layered materials with low\nthermal conductivities, which can guide and stimulate the search and study of\nother layered materials for TE applications.\n", "  We argue that a conformally invariant extension of general relativity coupled\nto the Standard Model is the fundamental theory that needs to be quantized. We\nshow that it can be treated by loop quantum gravity techniques. Through a gauge\nfixing and a modified Higgs mechanism particles acquire mass and one recovers\ngeneral relativity coupled to the Standard Model. The theory suggests new views\nwith respect to the definition of the Hamiltonian constraint in loop quantum\ngravity, the semi-classical limit and the issue of finite renormalization in\nquantum field theory in quantum space-time. It also gives hints about the\nelimination of ambiguities that arise in quantum field theory in quantum\nspace-time in the calculation of back-reaction.\n", "  We study the radiative heat transfer between two semi-infinite half-spaces,\nbounded by conductive surfaces in contact with vacuum. This setup is\ninterpreted as a four-terminal mesoscopic transport problem. The slabs and\ninterfaces are viewed as bosonic reservoirs, coupled perfectly to a scattering\ncenter consisting of the two interfaces and vacuum. Using Rytov's fluctuational\nelectrodynamics and assuming Kirchhoff's circuital law, we calculate the heat\nflow in each bath. This allows for explicit evaluation of a conductance matrix,\nfrom which one readily verifies B\\\"{u}ttiker symmetry. Thus, radiative heat\ntransfer in layered media with conductive interfaces becomes a\nLandauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker transport problem.\n", "  The $W$ boson angular distribution in events with high transverse momentum\njets is measured using data collected by the ATLAS experiment from\nproton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV at the\nLarge Hadron Collider, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$. The focus is on the contributions to $W$ + jets processes from real\n$W$ emission, which is achieved by studying events where a muon is observed\nclose to a high transverse momentum jet. At small angular separations, these\ncontributions are expected to be large. Various theoretical models of this\nprocess are compared to the data in terms of the absolute cross-section and the\nangular distributions of the muon from the leptonic $W$ decay.\n", "  We consider minimal dark matter scenarios featuring momentum-dependent\ncouplings of the dark sector to the Standard Model. We derive constraints from\nexisting LHC searches in the monojet channel, estimate the future LHC\nsensitivity for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, and compare with\nmodels exhibiting conventional momentum-independent interactions with the dark\nsector. In addition to being well motivated by (composite) pseudo-Goldstone\ndark matter scenarios, momentum-dependent couplings are interesting as they\nweaken direct detection constraints. For a specific dark matter mass, the LHC\nturns out to be sensitive to smaller signal cross-sections in the\nmomentum-dependent case, by virtue of the harder jet transverse-momentum\ndistribution.\n", "  The dilepton decay channels provide clean signatures and are an ideal hunting\nground for high mass resonant, like Z', or non-resonant, like contact\ninteractions or extra dimensions, searches at the LHC. The production of high\ninvariant mass opposite sign lepton pairs in proton-proton collisions in the\nStandard Model is dominated by the Drell-Yan process. In addition to this\nphoton or Z exchange mediated mechanism, photons radiated by the incoming\nprotons can collide and produce lepton pairs. In this paper detailed\ncalculations of the Drell-Yan process at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD\nand next-to-leading order in the electroweak corrections, augmented with the\nphoton-induced effects, are presented in the typical acceptance of a\nmulti-purpose LHC detector at center of mass energy 13 TeV. Estimates of the\nexpected backgrounds for new physics searches are provided for dilepton\ninvariant masses up to the LHC kinematic limit.\n", "  We construct a generalization of twistor spaces of hypercomplex manifolds and\nhyper-Kahler manifolds $M$, by generalizing the twistor $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$ to a\nmore general complex manifold $Q$. The resulting manifold $X$ is complex if and\nonly if $Q$ admits a holomorphic map to $\\mathbb{P}^1$. We make branched double\ncovers of these manifolds. Some class of these branched double covers can give\nrise to non-Kahler Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that these manifolds $X$ and\ntheir branched double covers are non-Kahler. In the cases that $Q$ is a\nbalanced manifold, the resulting manifold $X$ and its special branched double\ncover have balanced Hermitian metrics.\n", "  We study both the cosmological self-tuning and the local predictions (inside\nthe Solar system) of the most general shift-symmetric beyond Horndeski theory.\nWe first show that the cosmological self-tuning is generic in this class of\ntheories: By adjusting a mass parameter entering the action, a large bare\ncosmological constant can be effectively reduced to a small observed one.\nRequiring then that the metric should be close enough to the Schwarzschild\nsolution in the Solar system, to pass the experimental tests of general\nrelativity, and taking into account the renormalization of Newton's constant,\nwe select a subclass of models which presents all desired properties: It is\nable to screen a big vacuum energy density, while predicting an exact\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter solution around a static and spherically symmetric\nsource. As a by-product of our study, we identify a general subclass of beyond\nHorndeski theory for which regular self-tuning black hole solutions exist, in\npresence of a time-dependent scalar field. We discuss possible future\ndevelopment of the present work.\n", "  This document describes the top level requirements for the SKA-AAMID\ntelescope as determined by the SKA key science projects. These include\nparameters such as operating frequency range,instantaneous bandwidth (total\nprocessed bandwidth), field of view (or survey speed, as appropriate),\nsensitivity, dynamic range, polarization purity etc. Moreover, through the\ndefinition of a set of science requirements, this document serves as input to a\nnumber of other documents contained within the System Requirements Review\npackage. (particularly SKA-TEL-MFAA-0200005: `SKA-AAMID System Requirements'\nand SKA-TEL-MFAA-0200008: `MFAA Requirements').\n", "  This paper introduces an infinite linear hierarchy for the homogeneous,\nincompressible three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation. The Cauchy problem of\nthe hierarchy with a factorized divergence-free initial datum is shown to be\nequivalent to that of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in\n$\\mathcal{H}^1.$ This allows us to present an explicit formula for solutions to\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes equation under consideration. The obtained\nformula is an expansion in terms of binary trees encoding the collision\nhistories of the \"particles\" in a concise form. Precisely, each term in the\nsummation of $n$ \"particles\" collision is expressed by a $n$-parameter singular\nintegral operator with an explicit kernel in Fourier space, describing a kind\nof processes of two-body interaction of $n$ \"particles\". Therefore, this\nformula is a physical expression for the solutions of the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equation.\n", "  We propose hybrid schemes incorporating exact exchange into\nthermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT) [J.-D. Chai,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 136, 154104 (2012)] for an improved description of nonlocal\nexchange effects. With a few simple modifications, global and range-separated\nhybrid functionals in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) can be\ncombined seamlessly with TAO-DFT. In comparison with global hybrid functionals\nin KS-DFT, the resulting global hybrid functionals in TAO-DFT yield promising\nperformance for systems with strong static correlation effects (e.g., the\ndissociation of H2 and N2, twisted ethylene, and electronic properties of\nlinear acenes), while maintaining similar performance for systems without\nstrong static correlation effects. Besides, a reasonably accurate description\nof noncovalent interactions can be efficiently achieved through the inclusion\nof dispersion corrections in hybrid TAO-DFT. Relative to semilocal density\nfunctionals in TAO-DFT, global hybrid functionals in TAO-DFT are generally\nsuperior in performance for a wide range of applications, such as\nthermochemistry, kinetics, reaction energies, and optimized geometries.\n", "  One specific subset of quantum algorithms is Grovers Ordered Search Problem\n(OSP), the quantum counterpart of the classical binary search algorithm, which\nutilizes oracle functions to produce a specified value within an ordered\ndatabase. Classically, the optimal algorithm is known to have a $\\log_2 N$\ncomplexity; however, Grovers algorithm has been found to have an optimal\ncomplexity between the lower bound of $((\\ln N-1)/\\pi \\approx 0.221\\log_2 N)$\nand the upper bound of $0 .433\\log_2 N$. We sought to lower the known upper\nbound of the OSP. With [E. Farhi et al, arXiv:quant-ph/9901059], we see that\nthe OSP can be resolved into a translational invariant algorithm to create\nquantum query algorithm restraints. With these restraints, one can find Laurent\npolynomials for various $k$ -- queries -- and $N$ -- database sizes -- thus\nfinding larger recursive sets to solve the OSP and effectively reducing the\nupper bound. These polynomials are found to be convex functions, allowing one\nto make use of convex optimization to find an improvement on the known bounds.\nAccording to [A. Childs et al, arXiv:quant-ph/0608161v1], semidefinite\nprogramming, a subset of convex optimization, can solve the particular problem\nrepresented by the constraints . We were able to implement a program abiding to\ntheir formulation of a semidefinite program (SDP), leading us to find that it\ntakes an immense amount of storage and time to compute. To combat this setback,\nwe then formulated an approach to improve results of the SDP using matrix\nsparsity. Through the development of this approach, along with an\nimplementation of a rudimentary solver, we demonstrate how matrix sparsity\nreduces the amount of time and storage required to compute the SDP -- overall\nensuring further improvements will likely be made to reach the theorized lower\nbound\n", "  The relation between Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and tensor network is\nexplored from the perspectives of bulk-boundary duality and holographic\nentanglement entropy. We find that the LQG spin-network states in a space\n$\\Sigma$ with boundary $\\partial\\Sigma$ is an exact holographic mapping similar\nto the proposal in arXiv:1309.6282. The tensor network, understood as the\nboundary quantum state, is the output of the exact holographic mapping emerging\nfrom a coarse graining procedure of spin-networks. Furthermore, when a region\n$A$ and its complement $\\bar{A}$ are specified on the boundary\n$\\partial\\Sigma$, we show that the boundary entanglement entropy $S(A)$ of the\nemergent tensor network satisfies the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the\nsemiclassical regime, i.e. $S(A)$ is proportional to the minimal area of the\nbulk surface attached to the boundary of $A$ in $\\partial\\Sigma$.\n", "  Deterministic band gap in quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons is prerequisite\nfor their integrated functionalities in high-performance molecular-electronics\nbased devices. However, multiple band gap values commonly observed in the same\nwidth of graphene nanoribbons fabricated in same slot of the experiments\nremains unresolved, and raise a critical concern over scalable production of\npristine and/or hetero-structure nanoribbons with deterministic properties and\nfunctionalities for plethora of applications. Here, we show that a modification\nin the depth of potential wells in the periodic direction of a supercell on\nrelative shifting of passivating atoms at the edges is the origin of multiple\nband gap values for the same width of nanoribbons in a crystallographic\norientation, although they carry practically the same ground state energy. The\nresults are similar when calculations are extended from planar graphene to\nbuckled silicene nanoribbons. Thus, the findings facilitate tuning of the\nelectronic properties of quasi-one-dimensional materials such as bio-molecular\nchains, organic and inorganic nanoribbons by performing edge engineering.\n", "  This paper describes the search for a high-mass narrow-width scalar particle\ndecaying into a Z boson and a photon. The analysis is performed using\nproton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC at\ncenter-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated\nluminosities of 19.7 and 2.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. The Z bosons are\nreconstructed from opposite-sign electron or muon pairs. No statistically\nsignificant deviation from the standard model predictions has been found in the\n200-2000 GeV mass range. Upper limits at 95% confidence level have been derived\non the product of the scalar particle production cross section and the\nbranching fraction of the Z decaying into electrons or muons, which range from\n280 to 20 fb for resonance masses between 200 and 2000 GeV.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the nonsingular cosmology within the framework of\nthe Effective Field Theory(EFT) of cosmological perturbations. Due to the\nrecently proved no-go theorem, any nonsingular cosmological models based on the\ncubic Galileon suffer from pathologies. We show how the EFT could help us\nclarify the origin of the no-go theorem, and offer us solutions to break the\nno-go. Particularly, we point out that the gradient instability can be removed\nby using some spatial derivative operators in EFT. Based on the EFT\ndescription, we obtain a realistic healthy nonsingular cosmological model, and\nshow the perturbation spectrum can be consistent with the observations.\n", "  An exact canonical master equation of the Lindblad form is derived for a\ncentral spin interacting uniformly with a sea of completely unpolarized spins.\nThe Kraus operators for the dynamical map are also derived. The\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics in terms of the divisibility breaking of the\ndynamical map and increase of the trace distance fidelity between quantum\nstates is shown. Moreover, it is observed that the irreversible entropy\nproduction rate is always negative (for a fixed initial state) whenever the\ndynamics exhibits non-Markovian behavior. In continuation with the study of\nwitnessing non-Markovianity, it is shown that the positive rate of change of\nthe purity of the central qubit is a faithful indicator of the non-Markovian\ninformation back flow. Given the experimental feasibility of measuring the\npurity of a quantum state, a possibility of experimental demonstration of\nnon-Markovianity and the negative irreversible entropy production rate is\naddressed. This gives the present work considerable practical importance for\ndetecting the non-Markovianity and the negative irreversible entropy production\nrate.\n", "  Feedback traps are tools for trapping and manipulating single charged\nobjects, such as molecules in solution. An alternative to optical tweezers and\nother single-molecule techniques, they use feedback to counteract the Brownian\nmotion of a molecule of interest. The trap first acquires information about a\nmolecule's position and then applies an electric feedback force to move the\nmolecule. Since electric forces are stronger than optical forces at small\nscales, feedback traps are the best way to trap single molecules without\n\"touching\" them. Feedback traps can do more than trap molecules: They can also\nsubject a target object to forces that are calculated to be the gradient of a\ndesired potential function U(x). If the feedback loop is fast enough, it\ncreates a virtual potential whose dynamics will be very close to those of a\nparticle in an actual potential U(x). But because the dynamics are entirely a\nresult of the feedback loop--absent the feedback, there is only an object\ndiffusing in a fluid--we are free to specify and then manipulate in time an\narbitrary potential U(x,t). Here, we review recent applications of feedback\ntraps to studies on the fundamental connections between information and\nthermodynamics, a topic where feedback plays an even more-fundamental role. We\ndiscuss how recursive maximum likelihood techniques allow continuous\ncalibration, to compensate for drifts in experiments that last for days. We\nconsider ways to estimate work and heat to a precision of 0.03 kT over these\nlong experiments. Finally, we compare work and heat measurements of the costs\nof information erasure, the Landauer limit of kT ln2 per bit of information\nerased. We argue that when you want to know the average heat transferred to a\nbath in a long protocol, you should measure instead the average work and then\ninfer the heat using the first law of thermodynamics.\n", "  Recently a purportedly novel solution of the vacuum Einstein field equations\nwas discovered: it supposedly describes an asymptotically flat twisted black\nhole in 4-dimensions whose exterior spacetime rotates in a peculiar manner --\nthe frame dragging in the northern hemisphere is opposite from that of the\nsouthern hemisphere, which results in a globally vanishing angular momentum.\nFurthermore it was shown that the spacetime has no curvature singularity. We\nshow that the geometry of this black hole spacetime is nevertheless not free of\npathological features. In particular, it harbors a rather drastic conical\nsingularity along the axis of rotation. In addition, there exist closed\ntimelike curves due to the fact that the constant r and constant t surfaces are\nnot globally Riemannian. In fact, none of these are that surprising since the\nsolution is just the Taub-NUT geometry. As such, despite the original claim\nthat the twisted black hole might have observational consequences, it cannot\nbe.\n", "  In the supersymmetric scenario known as mirage mediation (MM), the soft SUSY\nbreaking terms receive comparable anomaly-mediation and moduli-mediation\ncontributions leading to the phenomenon of mirage unification. The simplest MM\nSUSY breaking models which are consistent with the measured Higgs mass and\nsparticle mass constraints are strongly disfavoured by fine-tuning\nconsiderations. However, while MM makes robust predictions for gaugino masses,\nthe scalar sector is quite sensitive to specific mechanisms for moduli\nstabilization and potential uplifting. We suggest here a broader setup of\ngeneralized mirage mediation (GMM), where heretofore discrete parameters are\nallowed as continuous to better parametrize these other schemes. We find that\nnatural SUSY spectra consistent with both the measured value of m(h). as well\nas LHC lower bounds on superpartner masses are then possible. We explicitly\nshow that models generated from natural GMM may be beyond the reach of even\nhigh-luminosity LHC searches. In such a case, the proposed International Linear\ne^+e^- Collider (ILC) will be required for natural SUSY discovery via higgsino\npair production reactions. We also outline prospects for detection of\nhiggsino-like WIMPs from natural GMM.\n", "  Solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) have the potential to increase both the\nenergy density and stability of lithium-based batteries, but low Li-ion\nconductivity remains a barrier to technological viability. SPEs are designed to\nmaximize Li-ion diffusivity relative to the anion, while maintaining sufficient\nsalt solubility. It is thus remarkable that polyethylene oxide (PEO), the most\nwidely used SPE, exhibits Li-ion diffusivity that is an order of magnitude\nsmaller than that of typical counter-ions, such as TFSI, at moderate salt\nconcentrations. Here, we show that Lewis-basic polymers like PEO intrinsically\nfavor slow cation and rapid anion diffusion while this relationship can be\nreversed in Lewis-acidic polymers. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,\nLewis-acidic polyboranes are identified that achieve up to a ten-fold increase\nin Li-ion diffusivity and a significant decrease in anion diffusivity, relative\nto PEO. The results for this new class of Lewis-acidic SPEs illustrate a\ngeneral principle for increasing Li-ion diffusivity and transference number\nwith polymer chemistries that exhibit weaker cation and stronger anion\ncoordination.\n", "  We construct static and spherically symmetric generalizations of the\nSchwarzschild- and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-(Anti-)de Sitter (RN-(A)dS) black-hole\nsolutions in four-dimensional Einsteinian cubic gravity (ECG). The solutions\nare determined by a single blackening factor which satisfies a non-linear\nsecond-order differential equation. Interestingly, we are able to compute\nindependently the Hawking temperature $T$, the Wald entropy $\\mathsf{S}$ and\nthe Abbott-Deser mass $M$ of the solutions analytically as functions of the\nhorizon radius and the ECG coupling constant $\\lambda$. Using these we show\nthat the first law of black-hole mechanics is exactly satisfied. Some of the\nsolutions have positive specific heat, which makes them thermodynamically\nstable, even in the uncharged and asymptotically flat case. Further, we claim\nthat, up to cubic order in curvature, ECG is the most general four-dimensional\ntheory of gravity which allows for non-trivial single-blackening factor\ngeneralizations of Schwarzschild- and RN-(A)dS which reduce to the usual\nEinstein gravity solutions when the corresponding higher-order couplings are\nset to zero.\n", "  We report synthesis of Co substitution at Fe site in Fe1-xCoxSe0.5Te0.5\n(x=0.0 to 0.10) single crystals via vacuum shield solid state reaction route\nusing flux free method. Single crystal XRD results showed that these crystals\ngrow in (00l) plane i.e., orientation in c-direction. All the crystals possess\ntetragonal structure having P4/nmm space group. Detailed scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) images show that the crystals are grown in slab-like\nmorphology. The EDAX results revealed the final elemental composition to be\nnear stoichiometric. Powder X-Ray diffraction (PXRD) Rietveld analysis results\nshow that (00l) peaks are shifted towards higher angle with increasing Co\nconcentration. Both a and c lattice parameters decrease with increasing Co\nconcentration in Fe1-xCoxSe0.5Te0.5 (x=0.0 to 0.10) single crystals. Low\ntemperature transport and magnetic measurements show that the superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc), decreases from around 12K to 10K and 4K for x=0.03\nand x=0.05 respectively. For x=0.10 crystal superconductivity is not observed\ndown to 2K.\n", "  In the context of generalised Brans-Dicke cosmology we use the Killing\ntensors of the minisuperspace in order to determine the unspecified potential\nof a scalar-tensor gravity theory. Specifically, based on the existence of\ncontact symmetries of the field equations, we find four types of potentials\nwhich provide exactly integrable dynamical systems. We investigate the\ndynamical properties of these potentials by using a critical point analysis and\nwe find solutions which lead to cosmic acceleration and under specific\nconditions we can have de-Sitter points as stable late-time attractors.\n", "  We propose a realistic theory based on the $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L\n\\otimes SU(3)_R \\otimes U(1)_{X}}$ gauge group which requires the number of\nfamilies to match the number of colors. In the simplest realization neutrino\nmasses arise from the canonical seesaw mechanism and their smallness correlates\nwith the observed V-A nature of the weak force. Depending on the symmetry\nbreaking path to the Standard Model one recovers either a left-right symmetric\ntheory or one based on the $\\mathrm{SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)}$\nsymmetry as the \"next\" step towards new physics.\n", "  The competition between interactions in frustrated magnets allows a wide\nvariety of new ground states, often exhibiting emergent physics and unique\nexcitations. Expanding the suite of lattices available for study enhances our\nchances of finding exotic physics. Mn$_2$Sb$_2$O$_7$ forms in a chiral,\nkagome-based structure in which a fourth member is added to the kagome-plane\ntriangles to form an armchair unit and link adjacent kagome planes. This\nstructural motif may be viewed as intermediate between the triangles of the\nkagome network and the tetrahedra in the pyrochlore lattice. Mn$_2$Sb$_2$O$_7$\nexhibits two distinct magnetic phase transitions, at 11.1 and 14.2K, at least\none of which has a weak ferromagnetic component. The magnetic propagation\nvector does not change through the lower transition, suggesting a metamagnetic\ntransition or a transition involving a multi-component order parameter.\nAlthough previously reported in the $P3_121$ space group, Mn$_2$Sb$_2$O$_7$\nactually crystallizes in $P2$, which allows ferroelectricity, and we show clear\nevidence of magnetoelectric coupling indicative of multiferroic order. The\nquasi-two-dimensional `armchair-kagome' lattice presents a promising platform\nfor probing chiral magnetism and the effect of dimensionality in highly\nfrustrated systems.\n", "  This paper is a next step in the project of systematic description of colored\nknot polynomials started in arXiv:1506.00339. In this paper, we managed to\nexplicitly find the $\\textit{inclusive}$ Racah matrices, i.e. the whole set of\nmixing matrices in channels $R^{\\otimes 3}\\longrightarrow Q$ with all possible\n$Q$, for $R=[3,3]$. The case $R=[3,3]$ is a multiplicity free case as well as\n$R=[2,2]$ obtained in arXiv:1605.03098. The calculation is made possible by the\nuse of highest weight method with the help of Gelfand-Tseitlin tables. The\nresult allows one to evaluate and investigate $[3,3]$-colored polynomials for\narbitrary 3-strand knots, and this confirms many previous conjectures on\nvarious factorizations, universality, and differential expansions. With the\nhelp of a method developed in arXiv:1605.04881 we manage to calculate {\\it\nexclusive} Racah matrices $S$ and $\\bar S$ in $R=[3,3]$. Our results confirm a\ncalculation of these matrices in arXiv:1606.06015, which was based on the\nconjecture of explicit form of differential expansion for twist knots. Explicit\nanswers for Racah matrices and $[3,3]$-colored polynomials for 3-strand knots\nup to 10 crossings are available at http://knotebook.org.\n", "  We continue the presentation of the pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR)\nmethod for computing the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET). We show in\ndetail how to employ the $t$-splitting variant of the method, which was first\npresented for $\\left\\langle\\phi^{2}\\right\\rangle_{ren}$, to compute the RSET in\na stationary, asymptotically-flat background. This variant of the PMR method\nwas recently used to compute the RSET for an evaporating spinning black hole.\nAs an example for regularization, we demonstrate here the computation of the\nRSET for a minimally-coupled, massless scalar field on Schwarzschild background\nin all three vacuum states. We discuss future work and possible improvements of\nthe regularization schemes in the PMR method.\n", "  The ability to measure every quantum observable is ensured by a fundamental\nresult in quantum measurement theory. Nevertheless, additive conservation laws\nassociated with physical symmetries, such as the angular momentum conservation,\nmay lead to restrictions on the measurability of the observables. Such\nlimitations are imposed by the theorem of Wigner, Araki and Yanase (WAY). In\nthis paper a new formulation of the WAY-theorem is presented rephrasing the\nmeasurability limitations in terms of quantum incompatibility. This broader\nmathematical basis enables us to both capture and generalise the WAY-theorem by\nallowing to drop the assumptions of additivity and even conservation of the\ninvolved quantities. Moreover, we extend the WAY-theorem to the general level\nof positive operator valued measures.\n", "  In this paper, we study Joule-Thomson effects for charged AdS black holes. We\nobtain inversion temperatures and curves. We investigate similarities and\ndifferences between van der Waals fluids and charged AdS black holes for the\nexpansion. We obtain isenthalpic curves for both systems in $T-P$ plane and\ndetermine the cooling-heating regions.\n", "  We investigate the Sommerfeld enhancement (SE) in the generalized scotogenic\nmodel with large electroweak multiplets. We focus on scalar dark matter (DM)\ncandidate of the model and compare DM annihilation cross sections to $WW$,\n$ZZ$, $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\gamma Z$ at present day in the galactic halo for\nscalar doublet and its immediate generalization, the quartet in their\nrespective viable regions of parameter space. We find that larger multiplet has\nsizable Sommerfeld enhanced annihilation cross section compared to the doublet\nand because of that it is more likely to be constrained by the current H.E.S.S.\nresults and future CTA sensitivity limits.\n", "  Propagation of few-cycle laser pulses in optical fiber is investigated beyond\nthe unidirectional approximation. Considered medium parameters include\ndispersion, Kerr and Raman nonlinearities. High intensities of ~10^10 kW/cm^2\nlead to generation of the octave-spanning continuum. The error of the\nunidirectional approximation is seen in simulations as two pulses propagating\nforwards and backwards, both remain weak under the considered conditions.\nDirect analytical estimate of the error is derived and verified numerically. It\ncan be applied to a priory justification of the unidirectional approach.\n", "  Generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes extend the notion of Robertson-Walker\nspacetimes, by allowing for spatial non-homogeneity. A survey is presented,\nwith main focus on Chen's characterization in terms of a timelike concircular\nvector. Together with their most important properties, some new results are\npresented.\n", "  The European Far-Infrared (FIR) Space Roadmap focuses on fundamental, yet\nstill unresolved, astrophysical questions that can only be answered through a\nfar-infrared space mission and gives an overview of the technology required to\nanswer them. The document discusses topics ranging from Solar System and Planet\nFormation, Our Galaxy and nearby Galaxies and Distant Galaxies and Galaxy\nEvolution. The FIR Roadmap was open to comments from the wider astronomical\ncommunity following a presentation during EWASS 2016.\n", "  A three-dimensional model is developed for prediction of solidification\nbehavior using non-linear transformation of the enthalpy equation in Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH) discretization. Effect of phase change in the form\nof release and absorption of latent heat is implemented implicitly as variable\nsource terms in the enthalpy calculations. Developed model is validated against\nvarious experimental, analytical, and numerical results from literature.\nResults confirm accuracy and robustness of the new procedures. Finally, the\nimproved SPH model is applied to study of Suspension Plasma Spraying (SPS) by\npredicting impact and solidification of molten ceramic droplets on the\nsubstrate. These cases include predictions for spread factor and splat\nformation depending on impact velocities and temperatures. This application\nhelps in identification of different processes involved in the SPS coating\nprocess.\n", "  Monolayer Mo$_2$C is a new member of two-dimensional materials. Here the\nelectronic structure and lattice dynamics of monolayer Mo$_2$C are calculated.\nAccording to the electron-phonon interaction, it is predicted that monolayer\nMo$_2$C could be a quasi-two-dimensional superconductor and the effects of\nfunctional-groups are crucially important considering its unsaturated surface.\nDespite the suppressed superconductivity by chalcogen adsorption, our most\ninteresting prediction is that the electron-phonon interaction of monolayer\nMo$_2$C can be greatly enhanced by bromine absorbtion, suggesting that\nMo$_2$CBr$_2$ as a good candidate for nanoscale superconductor.\n", "  The algebra of the generators for infinitesimal transformations of the\n$\\Gamma={1 \\over 2}$ representation of causal spinor fields (Dirac fields)\n\\emph{explicitly} constructs the Minkowski metric \\emph{within} the internal\ngroup space as a consequence of non-vanishing commutation relations between\ngenerators that carry a single space-time index. This representation is a\nsubgroup of the set of all of the generators that transform under the group\nGL(4). The sixteen hermitian generators of GL(4) include the three angular\nmomentum spin matrices, a matrix proportional to the Dirac matrix $\\gamma^0$,\nand 12 additional matrices that have the same number of degrees of freedom as\nSU(3)$\\times$SU(2)$\\times$U(1). In this paper, the construction of linearly\nindependent internal SU(3) and SU(2) local symmetry groups for the causal\nspinor fields is demonstrated to necessarily involve the CKM mixing of three\nsets of the SU(3) eigenstates as related to the SU(2) eigenstates.\n", "  We present F775W-F850LP (rest-frame UV-U) and F850LP-F160W (rest-frame U-R)\ncolour gradients for a sample of 17 elliptical galaxies morphologically\nselected in the cluster XMMU J2235.3-2557 at $z$=1.39. We detected significant\nnegative (redder inwards) U-R colour gradients in $\\sim$70 per cent of the\ngalaxies and flat gradients for the remaining ones. On the other hand, the UV-U\ngradients are significant positive (bluer inwards) for $\\sim$80 per cent of the\ngalaxies and flat for the remaining ones. Using stellar population synthesis\nmodels, we found that the behaviour of the two colour gradients cannot be\nsimultaneously explained by a radial variation of age, metallicity and/or dust.\nThe observed U-R gradients are consistent with a metallicity gradient (mean\nvalue $\\nabla_{Z} =-0.4$) in agreement with the one observed in the local\nelliptical galaxies. The positive UV-U gradients cannot be explained with age\nor metallicity variations and imply an excess of UV emission towards the\ngalaxies' central regions.This excess calls into question mechanisms able to\nefficiently produce UV emission. The data require either steady weak star\nformation (< 1 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) or an He-rich population in the cores of\nthese galaxies in order to simultaneously reproduce both the colour gradients.\nOn the contrary, the presence of a QSO cannot account for the observed UV\nexcess on its own. We discuss these hypotheses on the basis of current\nobservations and available models.\n", "  I show that a very simple model in the context of Newtonian physics promoted\nto a first approximation of general relativity can mimic Dark matter and\nexplain most of its intriguing properties. Namely: i) Dark matter is a halo\nassociated to ordinary matter; ii) Dark matter does not interact with ordinary\nmatter nor with itself; iii) Its influence grows with the size of the aggregate\nof ordinary matter that is considered, and iv) Dark matter influences the\npropagation of light.\n", "  We present the results from the first measurements of the Time-Correlated\nPulse-Height (TCPH) distributions from 4.5 kg sphere of $\\alpha$-phase\nweapons-grade plutonium metal in five configurations: bare, reflected by 1.27\ncm and 2.54 cm of tungsten, and 2.54 cm and 7.62 cm of polyethylene. A new\nmethod for characterizing source multiplication and shielding configuration is\nalso demonstrated. The method relies on solving for the underlying fission\nchain timing distribution that drives the spreading of the measured TCPH\ndistribution. We found that a gamma distribution fits the fission chain timing\ndistribution well and that the fit parameters correlate with both\nmultiplication (rate parameter) and shielding material types (shape parameter).\nThe source-to-detector distance was another free parameter that we were able to\noptimize, and proved to be the most well constrained parameter. MCNPX-PoliMi\nsimulations were used to complement the measurements and help illustrate trends\nin these parameters and their relation to multiplication and the amount and\ntype of material coupled to the subcritical assembly.\n", "  The examples of the classical liquids confined by rotating helical boundaries\nare considered and these examples are compared with rotating helical reservoir\nfilled by ultracold bosonic ensemble. From the point of view of observer who\nco-rotates with classical liquid trapped by reservoir the quantum fluid will\nmove translationally alongside rotation axis while in laboratory frame the\nquantum fluid will stay in rest. This behavior of quantum ensemble which is\nexactly opposite to the classical case might be interpreted as a helical analog\nof Hess-Fairbank effect.\n", "  Up to now, investigation of physical properties of ternary and higher\nnitridometalates was severely hampered by challenges concerning phase purity\nand crystal size. Employing a modified lithium flux technique, we are now able\nto prepare sufficiently large single crystals of the highly air and moisture\nsensitive nitridoferrate $\\rm Li_2Sr[Li_{1-x}Fe_xN]_2$ for anisotropic\nmagnetization measurements. The magnetic properties are most remarkable: large\nanisotropy and coercivity fields of 7 Tesla at $T = 2$ K indicate a significant\norbital contribution to the magnetic moment of iron. Altogether, the novel\ngrowth method opens a route towards interesting phases in the comparatively\nrecent research field of nitridometalates and should be applicable to various\nother materials.\n", "  Allowed charged $\\pi$ meson decays are characterized by simple dynamics, few\navailable decay channels, mainly into leptons, and extremely well controlled\nradiative and loop corrections. In that sense, pion decays represent a\nveritable triumph of the standard model (SM) of elementary particles and\ninteractions. This relative theoretical simplicity makes charged pion decays a\nsensitive means for testing the underlying symmetries and the universality of\nweak fermion couplings, as well as for studying pion structure and chiral\ndynamics. Even after considerable recent improvements, experimental precision\nis lagging far behind that of the theoretical description for pion decays. We\nreview the current state of experimental study of the pion electronic decay\n$\\pi^+ \\to e^+\\nu_e(\\gamma)$, or $\\pi_{e2(\\gamma)}$, where the $(\\gamma)$\nindicates inclusion and explicit treatment of radiative decay events. We\nbriefly review the limits on non-SM processes arising from the present level of\nexperimental precision in $\\pi_{e2(\\gamma)}$ decays. Focusing on the PEN\nexperiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland, we examine the\nprospects for further improvement in the near term.\n", "  PHENIX measurements are presented for the cross-section and double-helicity\nasymmetry ($A_{LL}$) of inclusive $\\pi^{0}$ production ($A_{LL}^{\\pi^{0}}$) at\nmidrapidity from $p+p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=510$ GeV from data taken in 2012\nand 2013 at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The next-to-leading\norder (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculation agrees excellently with the\npresented cross-section result. The $A_{LL}^{\\pi^{0}}$ follows an increasingly\npositive asymmetry as functions of $p_{T}$ and $\\sqrt{s}$ at the fixed $x_{T}$.\nThe latest global analysis results, which support the positive spin\ncontribution of gluon ($\\Delta{}G$), agrees excellently with the presented\nasymmetry result. The asymmetry result extends the experimental sensitivity to\nthe previously unexplored $x$ region down to $x\\sim0.01$ and provides\nadditional constraints on $\\Delta{}G$.\n", "  All next generation ground-based and space-based solar telescopes require a\ngood quality assessment metric in order to evaluate their imaging performance.\nIn this paper, a new image quality metric, the median filter gradient\nsimilarity (MFGS) is proposed for photospheric images. MFGS is a\nno-reference/blind objective image quality metric (IQM) by a measurement result\nbetween 0 and 1 and has been performed on short-exposure photospheric images\ncaptured by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) of the Fuxian Solar\nObservatory and by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode\nsatellite, respectively. The results show that: (1)the measured value of MFGS\nchanges monotonically from 1 to 0 with degradation of image quality; (2)there\nexists a linear correlation between the measured values of MFGS and\nroot-mean-square-contrast (RMS-contrast) of granulation; (3)MFGS is less\naffected by the image contents than the granular RMS-contrast. Overall, MFGS is\na good alternative for the quality assessment of photospheric images.\n", "  Motivated by applications that arise in online social media and collaboration\nnetworks, there has been a lot of work on community-search and team-formation\nproblems. In the former class of problems, the goal is to find a subgraph that\nsatisfies a certain connectivity requirement and contains a given collection of\nseed nodes. In the latter class of problems, on the other hand, the goal is to\nfind individuals who collectively have the skills required for a task and form\na connected subgraph with certain properties.\n  In this paper, we extend both the community-search and the team-formation\nproblems by associating each individual with a profile. The profile is a\nnumeric score that quantifies the position of an individual with respect to a\ntopic. We adopt a model where each individual starts with a latent profile and\narrives to a conformed profile through a dynamic conformation process, which\ntakes into account the individual's social interaction and the tendency to\nconform with one's social environment. In this framework, social tension arises\nfrom the differences between the conformed profiles of neighboring individuals\nas well as from differences between individuals' conformed and latent profiles.\n  Given a network of individuals, their latent profiles and this conformation\nprocess, we extend the community-search and the team-formation problems by\nrequiring the output subgraphs to have low social tension. From the technical\npoint of view, we study the complexity of these problems and propose algorithms\nfor solving them effectively. Our experimental evaluation in a number of social\nnetworks reveals the efficacy and efficiency of our methods.\n", "  We apply three data science techniques, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\n(NMF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis\n(ICA), to simulated X-ray energy spectra of a particular class of super-massive\nblack holes. Two competing physical models, one whose variable components are\nadditive and the other whose variable components are multiplicative, are known\nto successfully describe X-ray spectral variation of these super-massive black\nholes, within accuracy of the contemporary observation. We hope to utilize\nthese techniques to compare the viability of the models by probing the\nmathematical structure of the observed spectra, while comparing advantages and\ndisadvantages of each technique. We find that PCA is best to determine the\ndimensionality of a dataset, while NMF is better suited for interpreting\nspectral components and comparing them in terms of the physical models in\nquestion. ICA is able to reconstruct the parameters responsible for spectral\nvariation. In addition, we find that the results of these techniques are\nsufficiently different that applying them to observed data may be a useful test\nin comparing the accuracy of the two spectral models.\n", "  We define some new invariants for 3-manifolds using the space of taut codim-1\nfoliations along with various techniques from noncommutative geometry. These\ninvariants originate from our attempt to generalise Topological Quantum Field\nTheories in the Noncommutative geometry / topology realm.\n", "  Although individual spins in quantum dots have been studied extensively as\nqubits, their investigation under strong resonant driving in the scope of\naccessing Mollow physics is still an open question. Here, we have grown high\nquality positively charged quantum dots embedded in a planar microcavity that\nenable enhanced light-matter interactions. Under a strong magnetic field in the\nVoigt configuration, individual positively charged quantum dots provide a\ndouble-lambda level structure. Using a combination of above-band and resonant\nexcitation, we observe the formation of Mollow triplets on all optical\ntransitions. We find that when the strong resonant drive power is used to tune\nthe Mollow triplet lines through each other, we observe anticrossings. We also\ndemonstrate that the interaction that gives rise to the anticrossings can be\ncontrolled in strength by tuning the polarization of the resonant laser drive.\nQuantum-optical modeling of our system fully captures the experimentally\nobserved spectra and provides insight on the complicated level structure that\nresults from the strong driving of the double-lambda system.\n", "  Cells contain elaborate and interconnected networks of protein polymers which\nmake up the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton governs the internal positioning and\nmovement of vesicles and organelles, and controls dynamic changes in cell\npolarity, shape and movement. Many of these processes require tight control of\nthe size and shape of cytoskeletal structures, which is achieved despite rapid\nturnover of their molecular components. Here we review mechanisms by which\ncells control the size of filamentous cytoskeletal structures from the point of\nview of simple quantitative models that take into account stochastic dynamics\nof their assembly and disassembly. Significantly, these models make\nexperimentally testable predictions that distinguish different mechanisms of\nlength-control. While the primary focus of this review is on cytoskeletal\nstructures, we believe that the broader principles and mechanisms discussed\nherein will apply to a range of other subcellular structures whose sizes are\ntightly controlled and are linked to their functions.\n", "  Traveling wave solutions of (2 + 1)-dimensional Zoomeron equation(ZE) are\ndeveloped in terms of exponential functions involving free parameters. It is\nshown that the novel Lie group of transformations method is a competent and\nprominent tool in solving nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs) in\nmathematical physics. The similarity transformation method(STM) is applied\nfirst on (2 + 1)-dimensional ZE to find the infinitesimal generators.\nDiscussing the different cases on these infinitesimal generators, STM reduce (2\n+ 1)-dimensional ZE into (1 + 1)-dimensional PDEs, later it reduces these PDEs\ninto various ordinary differential equations(ODEs) and help to find exact\nsolutions of (2 + 1)-dimensional ZE.\n", "  T-branes, which are non-Abelian bound states of branes, were first introduced\nby Cecotti, Cordova, Heckman and Vafa \\cite{Cecotti:2010bp}. They are the\nrefined version of the monodromic branes that feature in the phenomenological\nF-theory models. Here, we will be interested in the T-brane corresponding to\nthe $Z_3$ monodromy which is used to break the $E_8$ gauge group to obtain the\n$SO(10)_{GUT}$. This extends the results of \\cite{Cecotti:2010bp} to the case\nof $Z_3$ monodromic T-branes used to break the $E_8$ gauge group to\n$SO(10)\\times SU(3)\\times U(1)$ and compute the Yukawa coupling with the help\nof the residue formula. We conclude that the Yukawa coupling,\n${\\bf{10}}_{H}\\cdot {\\bf{16}}_{M}\\cdot {\\bf{16}}_{M}$, is non-zero for $E_7$,\nin complete agreement with \\cite{Cecotti:2010bp}, but is zero for $E_8$.\nFurthermore, the case of $Z_2$ monodromic T-branes used to break the $E_8$\ngauge group to $E_{6}\\times SU(2)\\times U(1)$, nothing interesting can be\ndeduced by evaluating the Yukawa coupling ${\\bf{27}}_{H}\\cdot\n{\\bf{27}}_{M}\\cdot {\\bf{27}}_{M}$ which is dependent on whether the MSSM\nfermion and electroweak Higgs fields can be included in the same ${\\bf{27}}$\nmultiplet of a three-family $E_6$ GUT or assign the Higgs fields to a different\n${\\bf{27}}_{H}$ multiplet where only the Higgs doublets and singlets obtain the\nelectroweak scale energy.\n", "  We present evidence for the occurrence of a white-light flare on 10 September\n1886. It represents the third of such rare events reported in the history of\nastronomy. The flare was mentioned by Valderrama (1886, L'Astronomie 5, 388).\nIn this article we have used the original logbook of the observer, J.\nValderrama y Aguilar, an amateur astronomer that lived in Madrid and Santa Cruz\nde Tenerife at that time.\n", "  We present results for neutral D-meson mixing in 2+1-flavor lattice QCD. We\ncompute the matrix elements for all five operators that contribute to D mixing\nat short distances, including those that only arise beyond the Standard Model.\nOur results have an uncertainty similar to those of the ETM collaboration (with\n2 and with 2+1+1 flavors). This work shares many features with a recent\npublication on B mixing and with ongoing work on heavy-light decay constants\nfrom the Fermilab Lattice and MILC Collaborations.\n", "  The Schur-index of the $(A_1, X_n)$-Argyres-Douglas theory is conjecturally a\ncharacter of a vertex operator algebra. Here such vertex algebras are found for\nthe $A_{\\text{odd}}$ and $D_{\\text{even}}$-type Argyres-Douglas theories. The\nvertex operator algebra corresponding to $A_{2p-3}$-Argyres-Douglas theory is\nthe logarithmic $\\mathcal B_p$-algebra of [1], while the one corresponding to\n$D_{2p}$, denoted by $\\mathcal W_p$, is realized as a non-regular Quantum\nHamiltonian reduction of $L_{k}(\\mathfrak{sl}_{p+1})$ at level $k=-(p^2-1)/p$.\nFor all $n$ one observes that the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the vertex\noperator algebra of $D_n$ Argyres-Douglas theory is the vertex operator algebra\nof $A_{n-3}$ Argyres-Douglas theory. As corollary, one realizes the singlet and\ntriplet algebras (the vertex algebras associated to the best understood\nlogarithmic conformal field theories) as Quantum Hamiltonian reductions as\nwell. Finally, characters of certain modules of these vertex operator algebras\nand the modular properties of their meromorphic continuations are given.\n", "  In this paper, the famous Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations are firstly\ngeneralized, the new special types of Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations with the\npositive fractional power terms (gKGZE) are presented. In order to derive the\nexact solutions of new special gKGZE, the subsidiary higher order ordinary\ndifferential equations (sub-ODEs) with the positive fractional power terms are\nintroduced, and with the aids of the Sub-ODE, the exact solutions of three\nspecial types of the gKGZE are derived, which are the bell-type solitary wave\nsolution, the algebraic solitary wave solution, the kink-type solitary wave\nsolution and the sinusoidal traveling wave solution, provided that the\ncoefficients of gKGZE satisfy certain constraint conditions.\n", "  Three (2+1)-dimensional equations, they are KP equation, cylindrical KP\nequation and spherical KP equation, have been reduced to the same KdV equation\nby different transformation of variables respectively. Since the single\nsolitary wave solution and 2-solitary wave solution of the KdV equation have\nbeen known already, substituting the solutions of the KdV equation into the\ncorresponding transformation of variables respectively, the single and\n2-solitary wave solutions of the three (2+1)-dimensional equations can be\nobtained successfully.\n", "  Recent decades have witnessed the tremendous development of network science,\nwhich indeed brings a new and insightful language to model real systems of\ndifferent domains. Betweenness, a widely employed centrality in network\nscience, is a decent proxy in investigating network loads and rankings.\nHowever, the extremely high computational cost greatly prevents its applying on\nlarge networks. Though several parallel algorithms have been presented to\nreduce its calculation cost on unweighted networks, a fast solution for\nweighted networks, which are in fact more ubiquitous than unweighted ones in\nreality, is still missing. In this study, we develop an efficient parallel\nGPU-based approach to boost the calculation of betweenness centrality on very\nlarge and weighted networks. Comprehensive and systematic evaluations on both\nsynthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our solution can arrive the\nperformance of 30x to 150x speedup over the CPU implementation by integrating\nthe work-efficient and warp-centric strategies. Our algorithm is completely\nopen-sourced and free to the community and it is public available through\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4542405. Considering the pervasive\ndeployment and declining price of GPU on personal computers and servers, our\nsolution will indeed offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring the\nbetweenness related problems in network science.\n", "  Can one hear the shape of a drum? was proposed by Kac in 1966. The simple\nanswer is NO as shown through the construction of iso-spectral domains. There\nalready exists 17 families of planar domains which are non-isometric but\ndisplay the same spectra of frequencies. These frequencies, deduced from the\neigenvalues of the Laplacian, are determined by solving the wave equation in a\ndomain, which is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. This paper revisits\nthe serials of reflection rule inherent in the 17 families of iso-spectral\ndomains. In accordance with the reflection rule visualized by red-blue-black,\nwe construct real 3D isospectral models successfully. What is more,\naccompanying with the proof of transplantation method, we also use the\nnumerical method to verify the isospectrality of the 3D models.\n", "  We propose to realize microwave quantum illumination in weak coupling regime\nbased on multimode optomechanical systems. In our proposal the multimode\ntogether with a frequency-mismatch process could reduce mechanical thermal\nnoise. Therefore, we achieve a significant reduction of error probability than\nconventional detector in weak coupling regime. Moreover, we optimize the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for limited bandwidth by tuning the delay time of\nentangled wave-packets.\n", "  Electrical characteristics $(I(eV), dV/dI(eV), d^{2}V/dI^{2}(eV))$ are\nstudied comprehensively for pressed submicron point contacts between fresh\nfractures of LaSrCuO ceramic pellets and a normal metal (Cu). Point contacts\n(PC) with the direct-type conductivity are investigated, which are\ncharacterized by a considerable excess current due to Andreev reflection of\nquasiparticles at an NS boundary of high transparency. Basic requirements for\npoint contacts suitable for PC measurements are formulated. The models of\ninvestigated point contacts permitting the interpretation of the observed\ncharacteristics are considered. The results of measurement of the energy gap\nreveal that LaSrCuO is a superconductor with a strong coupling since the\nmaximum value of the ratio $2\\Delta/kT\\simeq 11$. It is found that\nsuperconducting properties may vary appreciably over distances of several tens\nof angstroms, resulting in some cases in the simultaneous emergence of two gaps\ncorresponding to two critical temperatures. The $dV/dI(eV)$ and\n$d^{2}V/dI^{2}(eV)$ curves display some high-intensity singularities whose\nposition on the eV-axis is practically independent of temperature and\ncorrelates with the phonon spectrum obtained in neutron scattering experiments.\nThis points to a strong electron-phonon interaction in LaSrCuO.\n", "  Analyses for $^{81}$Kr and noble gases on groundwater from the deepest\naquifer system of the Baltic Artesian Basin (BAB) were performed to determine\ngroundwater ages and uncover the flow dynamics of the system on a timescale of\nseveral hundred thousand years. We find that the system is controlled by mixing\nof three distinct water masses: Interglacial or recent meteoric water\n$(\\delta^{18}\\text{O} \\approx -10.4\\unicode{x2030})$ with a poorly evolved\nchemical and noble gas signature, glacial meltwater $(\\delta^{18}\\text{O} \\leq\n-18\\unicode{x2030})$ with elevated noble gas concentrations, and an old,\nhigh-salinity brine component $(\\delta^{18}\\text{O} \\geq -4.5\\unicode{x2030},\n\\geq 90 \\text{g Cl}^{-}/\\text{L})$ with strongly depleted atmospheric noble gas\nconcentrations. The $^{81}$Kr measurements are interpreted within this mixing\nframework to estimate the age of the end-members. Deconvoluted $^{81}$Kr ages\nrange from 300 ka to 1.3 Ma for interglacial or recent meteoric water and\nglacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the\nATTA 3 instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components $^{4}$He* and\n$^{40}$Ar* are less conclusive but also support an age of > 1 Ma for the brine.\nBased on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and the dating results, we\nconclude that the brine originates from evaporated seawater that has been\nmodified by later water-rock interaction. As the obtained tracer ages cover\nseveral glacial cycles, we discuss the impact of the glacial cycles on flow\npatterns in the studied aquifer system.\n", "  Due to the coupling of a quantum system to its environment energy can be\ntransfered between the two subsystems in both directions. In the present study\nwe consider this process in a general framework for interactions with different\nproperties and show how these properties govern the exchange.\n", "  Optical solitons-stable waves balancing delicately between nonlinearities and\ndispersive effects-have advanced the field of ultrafast optics and dynamics,\nwith contributions spanning supercontinuum generation and soliton fission, to\noptical event horizon, Hawking radiation, and optical rogue waves, amongst\nothers. Here we investigate picojoule soliton dynamics in silicon slow-light\nphotonic-bandgap waveguides under the influence of Drude-modeled free-carrier\ninduced nonlinear effects. Using real-time and single shot amplified dispersive\nFourier transform spectroscopy simultaneously with high-fidelity\ncross-correlation frequency-resolved optical gating at femtojoule sensitivity\nand femtosecond resolution, we examine the soliton stability limits, the\nsoliton dynamics including free-carrier quartic slow-light scaling and\nacceleration, and the Drude electron-hole-plasma induced perturbations on\nCherenkov radiation and modulation instability. Our real-time single shot and\ntime-averaged cross-correlation measurements are matched with our detailed\ntheoretical modeling, examining the reduced group velocity free-carrier\nkinetics on solitons at picojoule.\n", "  The relativistic five-quark equations are found in the framework of the\ndispersion relation technique. The solutions of these equations using the\nmethod based on the extraction of the leading singularities of the amplitudes\nare obtained. The five-quark amplitudes for the S = -3 strange pentaquarks\nincluding the u, d, s quarks determine the masses of strange pentaquarks. The\nmass spectra of the strange pentaquarks with JP=1/2, 3/2 are calculated.\n", "  $YBaCuO-Ag$ pressure point contacts with direct conduction are investigated.\nThe excess (relative to the normal state) conductivity mainly caused by\nfluctuational pairing of electrons above $T_c$ is measured in the temperature\ninterval 100-200~$K$. The superconductivity above 120~$K$ is found to be of the\ntwo-dimensional type. The obtained preliminary results indicate the presence of\nsmall amount of an unknown phase with $T'_c\\gtrsim 200~K$ in $YBaCuO$.\n", "  The influence of electric felds and currents has been investigated in the\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductors $YBaCuO$ and $BiSrCaCuO$ using a point-contact\ngeometry with $Ag$ as the counterelectrode, which reveal switching transitions\nbetween states of a different resistance. The origin of this effect in point\ncontacts is associated with electromigration of the oxygen, driven by the\nelectric feld as well as by the currentinduced \"electron wind\". The switching\neffect preserves its basic features at elevated temperatures up to room\ntemperature and in high magnetic felds up to 10 T.\n", "  In the study of Markov chain mixing times, analysis has centered on the\nperformance from a worst-case starting state. Here, in the context of Glauber\ndynamics for the one-dimensional Ising model, we show how new ideas from\ninformation percolation can be used to establish mixing times from other\nstarting states. At high temperatures we show that the alternating initial\ncondition is asymptotically the fastest one, and, surprisingly, its mixing time\nis faster than at infinite temperature, accelerating as the inverse-temperature\n$\\beta$ ranges from 0 to $\\beta_0=\\frac12\\mathrm{arctanh}(\\frac13)$. Moreover,\nthe dominant test function depends on the temperature: at $\\beta<\\beta_0$ it is\nautocorrelation, whereas at $\\beta>\\beta_0$ it is the Hamiltonian.\n", "  We have investigated the spontaneous decay rate of an excited molecule placed\nnear a circular aperture in a metal film of finite thickness and finite\nconductivity. We have considered the metal film both suspended freely in vacuum\nand lying on a substrate. A significant effect of molecule the position and the\npresence of the substrate on the rate of spontaneous emission of the molecule\nis shown. The asymptotes which can be used to describe this process are found.\nTotal, radiative, and non-radiative spontaneous decay rates of the excited\nmolecule are extracted and compared. The results may be useful in the\ndevelopment and interpretation of experiments investigating a single molecule\nwith a scanning optical microscope and in the design of optical nanodevices\nbased on the control of elementary quantum systems emission with a nanohole.\n", "  We report the first observation of the periodical properties for Talbot\neffect with {\\pi} phase jump. Analytical expressions are derived from\nsimplified modal method to analyze the novelty phenomenon of the Talbot effect\nwith {\\pi} phase jump, which can deepen our understanding of physical\ndiffraction process. Importantly, the physical reason of {\\pi} phase jump can\nbe attributed to that the two even grating modes make the left derivative and\nright derivative of real part of the E1 opposite in sign, which results in the\nphysical information of first order diffractive wave hidden in the near field\nTalbot effect image. We expect that this theoretical work will be helpful for\nthe tremendous potential applications of the Talbot effect.\n", "  We present a transfer-free preparation method for graphene on hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) crystals by chemical vapor deposition of graphene via a\ncatalytic proximity effect, i.e. activated by a Cu catalyst close-by . We\ndemonstrate the full coverage by monolayer graphene of half-millimeter-sized\nhexagonal boron nitride crystals exfoliated on a copper foil prior to growth.\nWe demonstrate that the proximity of the copper catalyst ensures high yield\nwith the growth rate estimated between of 2\\mu m/min to 5\\mu m/min . Optical\nand electron microscopies together with confocal micro-Raman mapping confirm\nthat graphene covers the top surface of h-BN crystals that we attribute to be a\nlateral growth from the supporting catalytic copper substrate. Structural and\nelectron transport characterization of the in-situ grown graphene present an\nelectronic mobility of about 20, 000cm2/(V.s). Comparison with graphene/h-BN\nstacks obtained by manual transferring of similar CVD graphene onto h-BN,\nconfirms the better neutrality reached by the self-assembled structures.\n", "  The existence of \"radio weak BL Lac objects\" (RWBLs) has been an open\nquestion, still unsolved, since the discovery that quasars could be radio-quiet\nor radio-loud. Recently several groups identified RWBL candidates, mostly found\nwhile searching for low energy counterparts of the unidentified/unassociated\ngamma-ray sources listed in the Fermi catalogs. Confirming RWBLs is a\nchallenging task since they could be confused with white dwarfs (WDs) or weak\nemission line quasars (WELQs) when there are not sufficient data to precisely\ndraw their broad band spectral energy distribution and their classification is\nmainly based on a featureless optical spectra. Motivated by the recent\ndiscovery that Fermi BL Lacs appear to have very peculiar mid-IR emission, we\nshow that it is possible to distinguish between WDs, WELQs and BL Lacs using\nthe [3.4]-[4.6]-[12]$\\mu$m color-color plot built using the WISE magnitudes\nwhen the optical spectrum is available. On the basis of this analysis, we\nidentify WISE J064459.38+603131 and WISE J141046.00+740511.2 as the first two\ngenuine RWBLs, both potentially associated with Fermi sources. Finally, to\nstrengthen our identification of these objects as true RWBLs, we present\nmultifrequency observations for these two candidates to show that their\nspectral behavior is indeed consistent with those of the BL Lac population.\n", "  QCD jets, produced copiously in heavy-ion collisions at LHC and also at RHIC,\nserve as probes of the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Jet\nfragmentation in the medium is interesting in its own right and, in order to\nextract pertinent information about the QGP, it has to be well understood. We\npresent a brief overview of the physics involved and argue that jet\nsubstructure observables provide new opportunities for understanding the nature\nof the modifications.\n", "  We prove existence of Abrikosov vortex lattice solutions of the\nGinzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity, with multiple magnetic flux\nquanta per a fundamental cell. We also revisit the existence proof for the\nAbrikosov vortex lattices, streamlining some arguments and providing some\nessential details missing in earlier proofs for a single magnetic flux quantum\nper a fundamental cell.\n", "  Gene transcription is a critical step in gene expression. The currently\naccepted physical model of transcription predicts the existence of a physical\nlimit on the maximal rate of transcription, which does not depend on the\ntranscribed gene. This limit appears as a result of polymerase \"traffic jams\"\nforming in the bulk of the 1D DNA chain at high polymerase concentrations.\nRecent experiments have, for the first time, allowed one to access live gene\nexpression dynamics in the Drosophila fly embryo in vivo under the conditions\nof heavy polymerase load and test the predictions of the model. Our analysis of\nthe data shows that the maximal rate of transcription is indeed the same for\nthe Hunchback, Snail and Knirps gap genes, and modified gene constructs in\nnuclear cycles 13, 14, but the experimentally observed value of the maximal\ntranscription rate corresponds to only 40 % of the one predicted by this model.\nWe argue that such a decrease must be due to a slower polymerase elongation\nrate in the vicinity of the promoter region. This effectively shifts the\nbottleneck of transcription from the bulk to the promoter region of the gene.\nWe suggest a quantitative explanation of the difference by taking into account\nabortive transcription initiation. Our calculations based on the independently\nmeasured abortive initiation constant in vitro confirm this hypothesis and find\nquantitative agreement with MS2 fluorescence live imaging data in the early\nfruit fly embryo. If our explanation is correct, then the transcription rate\ncannot be increased by replacing \"slow codons\" in the bulk with synonymous\ncodons, and experimental efforts must be focused on the promoter region\ninstead. This study extends our understanding of transcriptional regulation,\nre-examines physical constraints on the kinetics of transcription and\nre-evaluates the validity of the standard TASEP model of transcription.\n", "  We develop a topology data analysis-based method to detect early signs for\ncritical transitions in financial data. From the time-series of multiple stock\nprices, we build time-dependent correlation networks, which exhibit topological\nstructures. We compute the persistent homology associated to these structures\nin order to track the changes in topology when approaching a critical\ntransition. As a case study, we investigate a portfolio of stocks during a\nperiod prior to the US financial crisis of 2007-2008, and show the presence of\nearly signs of the critical transition.\n", "  Porous poly(ionic liquid) membranes that were prepared via electrostatic\ncross-linking were subsequently covalently cross-linked via formation of a\n1,3,5-triazine network. The additional covalent cross-links do not affect the\npore size and pore size distribution of the membranes and stabilize them\ntowards salt solutions of high ionic strength, enabling the membranes to work\nin a broader environmental window.\n", "  Our purpose is to focus attention on a new criterion for quantum schemes by\nbringing together the notions of quantum game and game isomorphism. A quantum\ngame scheme is required to generate the classical game as a special case. Now,\ngiven a quantum game scheme and two isomorphic classical games, we additionally\nrequire the resulting quantum games to be isomorphic as well. We show how this\nisomorphism condition influences the players' strategy sets. We are concerned\nwith the Marinatto-Weber type quantum game scheme and the strong isomorphism\nbetween games in strategic form.\n", "  We study the phase dynamics and IV--characteristics of DC--SQUIDs consisting\nof Josephson junctions with topologically nontrivial barriers, which cause the\nappearance of Majorana bound state. Its comparative analysis with the trivial\ncase is performed. The influence of external electromagnetic radiation is\nconsidered and the analysis of the amplitude dependence of the Shapiro step\nwidths is performed. We have shown that in nontrivial case the width of even\nharmonic of Shapiro step is larger than width of odd harmonic. In the presence\nof external dc magnetic field a beating state is realized in the DC--SQUID,\nwhich leads to a resonance branch in the IV--curve. We show that in the\npresence of resonance branch the maximum width of Shapiro step and periods of\nits amplitude dependence are decreased in comparison of situation without\nresonance in both trivial and nontrivial cases. We demonstrate that in the\npresence of the resonance branch the chaotic behavior of IV--curve is reduced.\n", "  In this paper, we give an geometric description of the Schur-Weyl duality for\ntwo-parameter quantum algebras $U_{v, t}(gl_n)$, where $U_{v, t}(gl_n)$ is the\ndeformation of $U_v(I, \\cdot)$, the classic Shur-Weyl duality $(U_{r, s}(gl_n),\nV^{\\otimes d}, H_d(r, s))$ can be seen as a corollary of the Shur-Weyl duality\n$(U_{v, t}(gl_n), V^{\\otimes d}, H_d(v, t))$ by using the galois descend\napproach. we also establish the Shur-Weyl duality between the algebras\n$\\widetilde{U_{v, t}(gl_N)^m}$, $\\widehat{U_{v, t}(gl_N)^m}$ and Heck algebra\n$H_k(v, t)$.\n", "  The dust-forming nova V2676 Oph is unique in that it was the first nova to\nprovide evidence of C_2 and CN molecules during its near-maximum phase and\nevidence of CO molecules during its early decline phase. Observations of this\nnova have revealed the slow evolution of its lightcurves and have also shown\nlow isotopic ratios of carbon (12C/13C) and nitrogen (14N/15N) in its nova\nenvelope. These behaviors indicate that the white dwarf (WD) star hosting V2676\nOph is a CO-rich WD rather than an ONe-rich WD (typically larger in mass than\nthe former). We performed mid-infrared spectroscopic and photometric\nobservations of V2676 Oph in 2013 and 2014 (respectively 452 and 782 days after\nits discovery). No significant [Ne II] emission at 12.8 micron was detected at\neither epoch. These provided evidence for a CO-rich WD star hosting V2676 Oph.\nBoth carbon-rich and oxygen-rich grains were detected in addition to an\nunidentified infrared feature at 11.4 micron originating from polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon molecules or hydrogenated amorphous carbon grains in the\nenvelope of V2676 Oph.\n", "  Despite recent advances in reputation technologies, it is not clear how\nreputation systems can affect human cooperation in social networks. Although it\nis known that two of the major mechanisms in the evolution of cooperation are\nspatial selection and reputation-based reciprocity, theoretical study of the\ninterplay between both mechanisms remains almost uncharted. Here, we present a\nnew individual-based model for the evolution of reciprocal cooperation between\nreputation and networks. We comparatively analyze four of the leading moral\nassessment rules---shunning, image scoring, stern judging, and simple\nstanding---and base the model on the giving game in regular networks for\nCooperators, Defectors, and Discriminators. Discriminators rely on a proper\nmoral assessment rule. By using individual-based models, we show that the four\nassessment rules are differently characterized in terms of how cooperation\nevolves, depending on the benefit-to-cost ratio, the network-node degree, and\nthe observation and error conditions. Our findings show that the most tolerant\nrule---simple standing---is the most robust among the four assessment rules in\npromoting cooperation in regular networks.\n", "  Breakup of drop/bubble can be viewed as a result of fundamental force balance\nwhen the disruptive force is greater than the restorative force. A disruptive\nforce acting on the drop/bubble tries to deform it, whereas a restorative force\nrefrains it from deforming. Studying breakup and coalescence phenomenon is\nutmost important since it governs the amount of interfacial area and hence the\nexchange of heat, mass and momentum across the interface. It also helps in the\ndevelopment of better closure relations for modeling large scale systems.\n  In this paper, abundant literature consisting of theoretical, experimental\nand numerical works up to date is reviewed. Broadly, breakup is classified into\nviscous, inertial and complex turbulent breakup. Physics involved and\nnon-dimensional numbers governing the drop and bubble breakup in various flow\nconfigurations are discussed. Characteristic parameters of the breakup such as\ncritical diameter ($d_{max}$), maximum deformation, breakup time ($t_b$),\nwavelength of disturbance ($\\lambda$), impurities in the flow, initial shape of\nthe drop/bubble, history of the flow and critical values of non-dimensional\nnumbers are examined and the important parameters are listed for ready-to-use\nin modeling approaches. Finally, scope for future work in number of areas is\nidentified.\n", "  The simplest model of the magnetized infinitely thin electron beam is\nconsidered. The basic equations that describe the periodic solutions for a\nself-consistent system of a couple of Maxwell equations and equations for the\nmedium are obtained.\n", "  In 2015 the calculation of the International (Zurich) sunspot number was\ncancelled, and it was replaced by a new \"recalibrated\" series. A new data\nseries was proposed also for the Group sunspot number. As a result, these two\nseries which originally differed mainly in their long-term trends, were\n\"reconciled\", and the long-term trends in both of them were minimized. These\nchanges led to new reconstructions of the long-term variations of solar\nirradiance, and to reconsidering the impact of the solar activity variations on\nclimate change. Here we use data for the number of sunspots and the number of\nsunspot groups from a single observatory with continuous and homogeneous\nobservations in order to evaluate how justified these recalibrations are.\n", "  The Ablowitz-Ladik equation is a very important model in the nonlinear\nmathematical physics. In this paper, the hyperbolic function solitary wave\nsolutions, the trigonometric function periodic wave solutions and the rational\nwave solutions with more arbitrary parameters of 2-dimensional Ablowitz-Ladik\nequation are derived by using the GG-expansion method, and the effect of the\nparameters (including the coupling constant and other parameters) on the linear\nstability of the exact solutions is analysed and numerically simulated.\n", "  Palomar 4 is a low-density globular cluster with a current mass $\\approx30000\nM_{\\odot}$ in the outer halo of the Milky Way with a two-body relaxation time\nof the order of a Hubble time. Yet, it is strongly mass segregated and contains\na stellar mass function depleted of low-mass stars. Pal 4 was either born this\nway or it is a result of extraordinary dynamical evolution. Since two-body\nrelaxation cannot explain these signatures alone, enhanced mass loss through\ntidal shocking may have had a strong influence on Pal 4. Here, we compute a\ngrid of direct N-body simulations to model Pal 4 on various eccentric orbits\nwithin the Milky Way potential to find likely initial conditions that reproduce\nits observed mass, half-light radius, stellar MF-slope and line-of-sight\nvelocity dispersion. We find that Pal 4 is most likely orbiting on an eccentric\norbit with an eccentricity of $e\\approx 0.9$ and pericentric distance of\n$R_p\\approx5$ kpc. In this scenario, the required 3D half-mass radius at birth\nis similar to the average sizes of typical GCs ($R_h\\approx4-5$ pc), while its\nbirth mass is about $M_0\\approx10^5 M_{\\odot}$. We also find a high degree of\nprimordial mass segregation among the cluster stars, which seems to be\nnecessary in every scenario we considered. Thus, using the tidal effect to\nconstrain the perigalactic distance of the orbit of Pal 4, we predict that the\nproper motion of Pal 4 should be in the range $-0.52\\leq\\mu_\\delta\\leq-0.38$\nmas\\,yr$^{-1}$ and $-0.30\\leq\\mu_{\\alpha\\cos\\delta}\\leq-0.15$ mas\\,yr$^{-1}$.\n", "  We present a square root law for active sensing of phase $\\theta$ of a single\npixel using optical probes that pass through a single-mode lossy thermal-noise\nbosonic channel. Specifically, we show that, when the sensor uses an $n$-mode\ncovert optical probe, the mean squared error (MSE) of the resulting estimator\n$\\hat{\\theta}_n$ scales as $\\langle\n(\\theta-\\hat{\\theta}_n)^2\\rangle=\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$; improving the\nscaling necessarily leads to detection by the adversary with high probability.\nWe fully characterize this limit and show that it is achievable using laser\nlight illumination and a heterodyne receiver, even when the adversary captures\nevery photon that does not return to the sensor and performs arbitrarily\ncomplex measurement as permitted by the laws of quantum mechanics.\n", "  The spectrum of electromagnetic waves emitted by an oscillator trapped in an\nexternal potential well is studied. It is assumed that the natural frequency of\nthe oscillator is much greater than the frequency of oscillations in the\npotential well. We consider the quantum model of emission with regard to the\nrecoil effect. The highest intensity of the absorption and emission lines is\nobserved on the natural frequency of the oscillator when the recoil energy is\nequal to the energy of the quantum of low-frequency (LF) oscillations in the\npotential well.\n  A certain decrease in the amplitude of the emission and absorption lines is\nnoted caused by the oscillations of the potential well due to, for example, the\npresence of the phonon spectrum. The relaxation times of the oscillator LF\nmotion in the potential well, resulted from the phonon emission, are estimated.\nIt is concluded that these processes have no influence on the observed features\nof the emission and absorption of high-frequency photons. This model can be\napplied to description of the emission and absorption of gamma rays in the\ncrystal structures even in the presence of the phonon spectrum on condition\nthat the relaxation time of the LF movements in the potential well is greater\nthan the lifetime of the HF oscillator.\n", "  We give an abstract formulation of the formal theory partial differential\nequations (PDEs) in synthetic differential geometry, one that would seamlessly\ngeneralize the traditional theory to a range of enhanced contexts, such as\nsuper-geometry, higher (stacky) differential geometry, or even a combination of\nboth. A motivation for such a level of generality is the eventual goal of\nsolving the open problem of covariant geometric pre-quantization of locally\nvariational field theories, which may include fermions and (higher) gauge\nfields. (abridged)\n", "  We present a robust calibration of the 1.4GHz radio continuum star formation\nrate (SFR) using a combination of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey\nand the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. We identify\nindividually detected 1.4GHz GAMA-FIRST sources and use a late-type, non-AGN,\nvolume-limited sample from GAMA to produce stellar mass-selected samples. The\nlatter are then combined to produce FIRST-stacked images. This extends the\nrobust parametrisation of the 1.4GHz-SFR relation to faint luminosities. For\nboth the individually detected galaxies and our stacked samples, we compare\n1.4GHz luminosity to SFRs derived from GAMA to determine a new 1.4GHz\nluminosity-to-SFR relation with well constrained slope and normalisation. For\nthe first time, we produce the radio SFR-M* relation over 2 decades in stellar\nmass, and find that our new calibration is robust, and produces a SFR-M*\nrelation which is consistent with all other GAMA SFR methods. Finally, using\nour new 1.4GHz luminosity-to-SFR calibration we make predictions for the number\nof star-forming GAMA sources which are likely to be detected in the upcoming\nASKAP surveys, EMU and DINGO.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenon of particle production in a\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe which contains a phase of de Sitter\nexpansion for a finite interval, outside which it reduces to the flat Minkowski\nspacetime. We compute the particle number density for a massive scalar and a\nspinorial field and point out differences between the two cases. We find that\nthe resulting particle density approaches a constant value at the scale of the\nHubble time and that for a certain choice of the parameters the spectrum is\nprecisely thermal for the spinorial field, and almost thermal for the scalar\nfield.\n", "  We study the representational power of a Boltzmann machine (a type of neural\nnetwork) in quantum many-body systems. We prove that any (local) tensor network\nstate has a (local) neural network representation. The construction is almost\noptimal in the sense that the number of parameters in the neural network\nrepresentation is almost linear in the number of nonzero parameters in the\ntensor network representation. Despite the difficulty of representing (gapped)\nchiral topological states with local tensor networks, we construct a\nquasi-local neural network representation for a chiral p-wave superconductor.\nThis demonstrates the power of Boltzmann machines.\n", "  The interaction of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with various magnetic fields\ncould directly induce cellular effects. Many scattered investigations have got\ninvolved in these cellular effects, analyzed their relative mechanisms and\nextended their biomedical uses in magnetic hyperthermia and cell regulation.\nThis review reports these cellular effects and their important applications in\nbiomedical area. More importantly, we highlight the underlying mechanisms\nbehind these direct cellular effects in the review from the thermal energy and\nmechanical force. Recently, some physical analyses showed that the mechanisms\nof heat and mechanical force in cellular effects are controversial. Although\nthe physical principle plays an important role in these cellular effects, some\nchemical reactions such as free radical reaction also existed in the\ninteraction of MNPs with magnetic fields, which provides the possible\nexplanation for the current controversy. It's anticipated that the review here\ncould provide readers a deeper understanding of mechanisms of how MNPs\ncontribute to the direct cellular effects and thus their biomedical\napplications under various magnetic fields.\n", "  In \\cite{fl}, the authors get a new presentation of two-parameter quantum\nalgebra $U_{v,t}(\\mathfrak{g})$. Their presentation can cover all Kac-Moody\ncases. In this paper, we construct a suitable Hopf pairing such that\n$U_{v,t}(sl_{n})$ can be realized as Drinfeld double of certain Hopf\nsubalgebras with respect to the Hopf pairing. Using Hopf pairing, we construct\na $R$-matrix for $U_{v,t}(sl_{n})$ which will be used to give the Schur-Weyl\ndual between $U_{v,t}(sl_{n})$ and Hecke algebra $H_{k}(v,t)$. Furthermore,\nusing the Fusion procedure we construct the primitive orthogonal idempotents of\n$H_{k}(v,t)$. As a corollary, we give the explicit construction of irreducible\n$U_{v,t}(sl_{n})$-representations of $V^{\\otimes k}$.\n", "  We discuss operators of the type $H = -\\Delta + V(x) - \\alpha\n\\delta(x-\\Sigma)$ with an attractive interaction, $\\alpha>0$, in\n$L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $\\Sigma$ is an infinite surface, asymptotically\nplanar and smooth outside a compact, dividing the space into two regions, of\nwhich one is supposed to be convex, and $V$ is a potential bias being a\npositive constant $V_0$ in one of the regions and zero in the other. We find\nthe essential spectrum and ask about the existence of the discrete one with a\nparticular attention to the critical case, $V_0=\\alpha^2$. We show that\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{disc}(H)$ is then empty if the bias is supported in the\n`exterior' region, while in the opposite case isolated eigenvalues may exist.\n", "  We introduce and study a one-parameter generalization of the q-Whittaker\nsymmetric functions. This is a family of multivariate symmetric polynomials,\nwhose construction may be viewed as an application of the procedure of fusion\nfrom integrable lattice models to a vertex model interpretation of a\none-parameter generalization of Hall-Littlewood polynomials from [Bor17, BP16a,\nBP16b].\n  We prove branching and Pieri rules, standard and dual (skew) Cauchy summation\nidentities, and an integral representation for the new polynomials.\n", "  The Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 is known to exhibit significant\nX-ray spectral/flux variations and have a number of emission/absorption\nfeatures. X-ray observations have revealed that these absorption features are\nblueshifted, which indicates that NGC 4051 has warm absorber outflow. In order\nto constrain physical parameters of the warm absorber outflow, we analyze the\narchival data with the longest exposure taken by XMM-Newton in 2009. We\ncalculate the root-mean-square (RMS) spectra with the grating spectral\nresolution for the first time. The RMS spectra have a sharp peak and several\ndips, which can be explained by variable absorption features and non-variable\nemission lines; a lower-ionized warm absorber (WA1: $\\log\\xi = 1.5,\\,\nv=-650\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$) shows large variability, whereas higher-ionized\nwarm absorbers (WA2: $\\log\\xi= 2.5,\\,v=-4100\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$, WA3:\n$\\log\\xi= 3.4,\\, v=-6100\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1}$) show little variability. WA1\nshows the maximum variability at a timescale of $\\sim10^4$~s, suggesting that\nthe absorber locates at $\\sim10^3$ times of the Schwarzschild radius. The depth\nof the absorption features due to WA1 and the observed soft X-ray flux are\nanti-correlated in several observational sequences, which can be explained by\nvariation of partial covering fraction of the double-layer blobs that are\ncomposed of the Compton-thick core and the ionized layer ($=$WA1). WA2 and WA3\nshow little variability and presumably extend uniformly in the line of sight.\nThe present result shows that NGC 4051 has two types of the warm absorber\noutflows; the static, high-ionized and extended line-driven disk winds, and the\nvariable, low-ionized and clumpy double-layer blobs.\n", "  Stress field solutions and Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) are found for\n$n$-cusped hypocycloidal shaped voids and rigid inclusions in an infinite\nlinear elastic plane subject to nonuniform remote antiplane loading, using\ncomplex potential and conformal mapping. It is shown that a void with\nhypocycloidal shape can lead to a higher SIF than that induced by a\ncorresponding star-shaped crack; this is counter intuitive as the latter\nusually produces a more severe stress field in the material. Moreover, it is\nobserved that when the order $m$ of the polynomial governing the remote loading\ngrows, the stress fields generated by the hypocycloidal-shaped void and the\nstar-shaped crack tend to coincide, so that they become equivalent from the\npoint of view of a failure analysis. Finally, special geometries and loading\nconditions are discovered for which there is no stress singularity at the\ninclusion cusps and where the stress is even reduced with respect to the case\nof the absence of the inclusion. The concept of Stress Reduction Factor (SRF)\nin the presence of a sharp wedge is therefore introduced, contrasting with the\nwell-known definition of Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) in the presence of\ninclusions with smooth boundary. The results presented in this paper provide\ncriteria that will help in the design of ultra strong composite materials,\nwhere stress singularities always promote failure. Furthermore, they will\nfacilitate finding the special conditions where resistance can be optimized in\nthe presence of inclusions with non-smooth boundary.\n", "  We derive asymptotic estimates for the velocity of random walks in random\nenvironments which are perturbations of the simple symmetric random walk but\nhave a small local drift in a given direction. Our estimates complement\nprevious results presented by Sznitman and are in the spirit of expansions\nobtained by Sabot.\n", "  David Finkelstein was very fond of the new information-theoretic paradigm of\nphysics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. Only recently,\nhowever, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation\nof quantum theory (Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. A 84:012311, 2011; D'Ariano et\nal., 2017) and of free quantum field theory (D'Ariano and Perinotti, Phys. Rev.\nA 90:062106, 2014; Bisio et al., Phys. Rev. A 88:032301, 2013; Bisio et al.,\nAnn. Phys. 354:244, 2015; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 368:177, 2016) from\ninformational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the\npossibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical\ntheory, allowing a refoundation of the whole physics over logically solid\ngrounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new\ninformation-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly\ninteresting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with\nthe idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information\nprocessing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the\nholographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev.\nMod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory\nis derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special\nrelativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided\nby the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum\nsystems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple\nprinciples: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature\nof the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory\nin terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic\nargument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the observed regime is that of\nsmall wavevectors ...\n", "  Ambiguities in the definition of stored energy within distributed or\nradiating electromagnetic systems motivate the discussion of the well-defined\nconcept of recoverable energy. This concept is commonly overlooked by the\ncommunity and the purpose of this communication is to recall its existence and\nto discuss its relationship to fractional bandwidth. Using a rational function\napproximation of a system's input impedance, the recoverable energy of lumped\nand radiating systems is calculated in closed form and is related to stored\nenergy and fractional bandwidth. Lumped circuits are also used to demonstrate\nthe relationship between recoverable energy and the energy stored within\nequivalent circuits produced by the minimum phase-shift Darlington's synthesis\nprocedure.\n", "  Vortices play a crucial role in determining the properties of superconductors\nas well as their applications. Therefore, characterization and manipulation of\nvortices, especially at the single vortex level, is of great importance. Among\nmany techniques to study single vortices, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nstands out as a powerful tool, due to its ability to detect the local\nelectronic states and high spatial resolution. However, local control of\nsuperconductivity as well as the manipulation of individual vortices with the\nSTM tip is still lacking. Here we report a new function of the STM, namely to\ncontrol the local pinning in a superconductor through the heating effect. Such\neffect allows us to quench the superconducting state at nanoscale, and leads to\nthe growth of vortex-clusters whose size can be controlled by the bias voltage.\nWe also demonstrate the use of an STM tip to assemble single quantum vortices\ninto desired nanoscale configurations.\n", "  The advent of graphene created a revolution in materials science. Because of\nthis there is a renewed interest in other carbon-based structures. Graphene is\nthe ultimate (just one atom thick) membrane. It has been proposed that graphene\ncan work as impermeable membrane to standard gases, such argon and helium.\nGraphene-like porous membranes, but presenting larger porosity and potential\nselectivity would have many technological applications. Biphenylene carbon\n(BPC), sometimes called graphenylene, is one of these structures. BPC is a\nporous two-dimensional (planar) allotrope carbon, with its pores resembling\ntypical sieve cavities and/or some kind of zeolites. In this work, we have\ninvestigated the hydrogenation dynamics of BPC membranes under different\nconditions (hydrogenation plasma density, temperature, etc.). We have carried\nout an extensive study through fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations using the reactive force field ReaxFF, as implemented in the\nwell-known Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)\ncode. Our results show that the BPC hydrogenation processes exhibit very\ncomplex patterns and the formation of correlated domains (hydrogenated islands)\nobserved in the case of graphene hydrogenation was also observed here. MD\nresults also show that under hydrogenation BPC structure undergoes a change in\nits topology, the pores undergoing structural transformations and extensive\nhydrogenation can produce significant structural damages, with the formation of\nlarge defective areas and large structural holes, leading to structural\ncollapse.\n", "  We introduce the concept of saturated absorption competition (SAC) microscopy\nas a means of providing sub-diffraction spatial resolution in fluorescence\nimaging. Unlike the post-competition process between stimulated and spontaneous\nemission that is used in stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, SAC\nmicroscopy breaks the diffraction limit by emphasizing a pre-competition\nprocess that occurs in the fluorescence absorption stage in a manner that\nshares similarities with ground-state depletion (GSD) microscopy. Moreover,\nunlike both STED and GSD microscopy, SAC microscopy offers a reduction in\ncomplexity and cost by utilizing only a single continuous-wave laser diode and\nan illumination intensity that is ~ 20x smaller than that used in STED. Our\napproach can be physically implemented in a confocal microscope by dividing the\ninput laser source into a time-modulated primary excitation beam and a\ndoughnut-shaped saturation beam, and subsequently employing a homodyne\ndetection scheme to select the modulated fluorescence signal. Herein, we\nprovide both a physico-chemical model of SAC and experimentally demonstrate by\nway of a proof-of-concept experiment a transverse spatial resolution of\n~lambda/6.\n", "  The generalized spin-one-half Falicov-Kimball model with Hund and Hubbard\ncoupling is used to examine effects of spin ordering on superconducting\ncorrelations in the strongly correlated electron and spin systems. It is found\nthat the ferromagnetic spin clusters (lines, bands, domains) suppress the\nsuperconducting correlations in the d-wave chanel, while the antiferromagnetic\nones have the fully opposite effect. The enhancement of the superconducting\ncorrelations due to the antiferromagnetic spin ordering is by factor 3 in the\naxial striped phase and even by the factor 8 in the phase segregated phase.\n", "  Characterization, correlation and provenance determination of tephra samples\nin sedimentary sections (tephrochronological studies) are powerful tools for\nestablishing ages of depositional events, volcanic eruptions, and tephra\ndispersion. Despite the large literature and the advancements in this research\nfield, the univocal attribution of tephra deposits to specific volcanic sources\nremains too often elusive. In this contribution, we test the application of a\nmachine learning technique named Support Vector Machine to attempt shedding new\nlight upon tephra deposits related to one of the most complex and debated\nvolcanic regions on Earth: the Pliocene-Pleistocene magmatism in Italy. The\nmachine learning algorithm was trained using one of the most comprehensive\nglobal petrological databases (GEOROC); 17 chemical elements including major\nand selected trace elements were chosen as input parameters. We first show the\nability of support vector machines in discriminating among different\nPliocene-Pleistocene volcanic provinces in Italy and then apply the same\nmethodology to determine the volcanic source of tephra samples occurring in the\nCaio outcrop, an Early Pleistocene sedimentary section located in Central\nItaly.\n", "  We investigated the surface structure of hydrogels of\npoly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) hydrogels synthesized and cross-linked\nsimultaneously by redox free radical polymerization. We demonstrate the\nexistence of a less cross-linked layer at the surface of the gel at least at\ntwo different length scales characterized by shear rheology and by neutron\nreflectivity, suggesting the existence of a gradient in cross-linking. The\ncomposition of the layer is shown to depend on the degree of hydrophobicity of\nthe mold surface and is weaker for more hydrophobic molds. While the\nmacroscopic tests proved the existence of a relatively thick under-cross-linked\nlayer, we also demonstrated by neutron reflectivity that the gel surface at the\nsubmicrometric scale (500 nm) was also affected by the surface treatment of the\nmold. These results should have important implications for the measurement of\nmacroscopic surface properties of these hydrogels such as friction or adhesion.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the modelization of the photoacoustic effect\ngenerated by the electromagnetic heating of metallic nanoparticles embedded in\na biological tissue. We first derive an asymptotic models for the plasmonic\nresonances and the electromagnetic fields. We then describe the acoustic\ngeneration created by the electromagnetic heating of the nanoparticle.\nPrecisely, we derive the model equations that describes the coupling between\nthe temperature rise in the medium and the acoustic wave generation. We obtain\na direct relation between the acoustic waves and the electromagnetic external\nsources. Finally, we solve the multiwave inverse problem that consists in the\nrecovery of the electric permittivity of the biological tissue from the\nmeasurements of the generated acoustic waves on the boundary of the sample.\n", "  In this note we construct vertex operators in effective string theory using\nthe simplified covariant formalism, i.e. by embedding it in the Polyakov\nformalism supplemented by an anomaly term, and fixing to conformal gauge. These\nvertex operators represent off-shell background fields rather than dynamical\nstring states. We construct vertex operators for nontrivial scalar,\nelectromagnetic, and gravitational backgrounds. As an application, we compute a\nscalar form factor of a long string with length $R$, where the Fourier momentum\n$q$ of the external scalar field satisfies $q^2 \\ll 1/\\alpha^\\prime$, and we\nfind the expected logarithmic dependence on the size of the string.\n", "  Propargyl alcohol (HC2CH2OH, PA) has yet to be observed in the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) although one of its stable isomers, propenal (CH2CHCHO), has\nalready been detected in Sagittarius B2(N) with the 100-meter Green Bank\nTelescope in the frequency range $18-26$ GHz. In this paper, we investigate the\nformation of propargyl alcohol along with one of its deuterated isotopomers,\nHC2CH2OD(OD-PA), in a dense molecular cloud. Various pathways for the formation\nof PA in the gas and on ice mantles surrounding dust particles are discussed.\nWe use a large gas-grain chemical network to study the chemical evolution of PA\nand its deuterated isotopomer. Our results suggest that gaseous HC2CH2OH can\nmost likely be detected in hot cores or in collections of hot cores such as the\nstar-forming region Sgr B2(N). A simple LTE (Local thermodynamic equilibrium)\nradiative transfer model is employed to check the possibility of detecting PA\nand OD-PA in the millimeter-wave regime. In addition, we have carried out\nquantum chemical calculations to compute the vibrational transition frequencies\nand intensities of these species in the infrared for perhaps future use in\nstudies with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).\n", "  Perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) with a bottom pinned reference\nlayer and a composite free layer (FL) are investigated. Different thicknesses\nof the FL were tested to obtain an optimal balance between tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) ratio and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. After\nannealing at 400 $^\\circ$C, the TMR ratio for 1.5 nm thick CoFeB sublayer\nreached 180 % at room temperature and 280 % at 20 K with an MgO tunnel barrier\nthickness corresponding to the resistance area product RA = 10\nOhm$\\mathrm{\\mu}$m$^2$. The voltage vs. magnetic field stability diagrams\nmeasured in pillar-shaped MTJs with 130 nm diameter indicate the competition\nbetween spin transfer torque (STT), voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy\n(VCMA) and temperature effects in the switching process. An extended stability\nphase diagram model that takes into account all three parameters and the\neffective damping measured independently using broadband ferromagnetic\nresonance technique enabled the determination of both STT and VCMA coefficients\nthat are responsible for the FL magnetization switching.\n", "  The metamaterial based on two planar photonic crystals was used on\nexperimental express analysis of liquids. The metamaterial operates at a\nfrequency of about 9.5 GHz, and has a small size. It was shown experimentally\nthat when the liquid in container was placed in the resonance region at the\ninterface of the two photonic crystals the parameters of resonance peak of\ntransmission coefficient were changed. It was shown experimentally that\ndifferent liquids have a different character of depending of the inverse\nQ-factor and the resonance frequency of the resonance peak on the distance from\nthe interface of the photonic crystals to the container with liquid, and this\ndependence leads to one-to-one identification of such liquid. Thus, the ability\nof express analysis of liquids in a container by using a metamaterial based on\ntwo planar photonic crystals is demonstrated experimentally.\n", "  We studied the formation of a pore in AR NOAA 11462. We analysed data\nobtained with the IBIS at the DST on April 17, 2012, consisting of full Stokes\nmeasurements of the Fe I 617.3 nm lines. Furthermore, we analysed SDO/HMI\nobservations in the continuum and vector magnetograms derived from the Fe I\n617.3 nm line data taken from April 15 to 19, 2012. We estimated the magnetic\nfield strength and vector components and the LOS and horizontal motions in the\nphotospheric region hosting the pore formation. We discuss our results in light\nof other observational studies and recent advances of numerical simulations.\nThe pore formation occurs in less than 1 hour in the leading region of the AR.\nThe evolution of the flux patch in the leading part of the AR is faster (< 12\nhour) than the evolution (20-30 hour) of the more diffuse and smaller scale\nflux patches in the trailing region. During the pore formation, the ratio\nbetween magnetic and dark area decreases from 5 to 2. We observe strong\ndownflows at the forming pore boundary and diverging proper motions of plasma\nin the vicinity of the evolving feature that are directed towards the forming\npore. The average values and trends of the various quantities estimated in the\nAR are in agreement with results of former observational studies of steady\npores and with their modelled counterparts, as seen in recent numerical\nsimulations of a rising-tube process. The agreement with the outcomes of the\nnumerical studies holds for both the signatures of the flux emergence process\n(e.g. appearance of small-scale mixed polarity patterns and elongated granules)\nand the evolution of the region. The processes driving the formation of the\npore are identified with the emergence of a magnetic flux concentration and the\nsubsequent reorganization of the emerged flux, by the combined effect of\nvelocity and magnetic field, in and around the evolving structure.\n", "  The aim of this comment is to show that anisotropic effects and image fields\nshould not be omitted as they are in the publication of A. Leonardi, S. Ryu, N.\nM. Pugno, and P. Scardi (LRPS) [J. Appl. Phys. 117, 164304 (2015)] on Pd <011>\ncylindrical nanowires containing an axial screw dislocation. Indeed, according\nto our previous study [Phys. Rev. B 88, 224101 (2013)], the axial displacement\nfield along the nanowire exhibits both a radial and an azimuthal dependence\nwith a twofold symmetry due the <011> orientation. As a consequence, the\ndeviatoric strain term used by LRPS is not suitable to analyze the anisotropic\nstrain fields that should be observed in their atomistic simulations. In this\ncomment, we first illustrate the importance of anisotropy in <011> Pd nanowire\nby calculating the azimuthal dependence of the deviatoric strain term. Then the\nexpression of the anisotropic elastic field is recalled in term of strain\ntensor components to show that image fields should be also considered. The\nother aspect of this comment concerns the supposedly loss of correlation along\nthe nanorod caused by the twist. It is claimed for instance by LRPS that : \"As\nan effect of the dislocation strain and twist, if the cylinder is long enough,\nupper/lower regions tend to lose correlation, as if the rod were made of\ndifferent sub-domains.\". This assertion appears to us misleading since for any\ntwist the position of all the atoms in the nanorod is perfectly defined and\ntherefore prevents any loss of correlation. To clarify this point, it should be\nspecified that this apparent loss of correlation can not be ascribed to the\ntwisted state of the nanowire but is rather due to a limitation of the X-ray\npowder diffraction. Considering for instance coherent X-ray diffraction, we\nshow an example of high twist where the simulated diffractogram presents a\nclear signature of the perfect correlation.\n", "  Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is one of the most promising multiferroics with a\nsufficiently high ferroelectric (FE) and antiferromagnetic transition\ntemperatures, and magnetoelectric (ME) coupling coefficient at room\ntemperature, and thus it is highly sensitive to the impact of cross-influence\nof applied electric and magnetic fields. According to the urgent demands of\nnanotechnology miniaturization for ultra-high density data storage in advanced\nnonvolatile memory cells, it is very important to reduce the sizes of\nmultiferroic nanoparticles in the self-assembled arrays without serious\ndeterioration of their properties. We study size effects of the phase diagrams,\nFE and ME properties of semi-ellipsoidal BiFeO3 nanoparticles clamped to a\nrigid conductive substrate. The spatial distribution of the spontaneous\npolarization vector inside the nanoparticles, phase diagrams and\nparamagnetoelectric (PME) coefficient were calculated in the framework of\nmodified Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach. Analytical expressions were\nderived for the dependences of the FE transition temperature, average\npolarization, linear dielectric susceptibility and PME coefficient on the\nparticle sizes for a general case of a semi-ellipsoidal nanoparticles with\nthree different semi-axes a, b and height c. The analyses of the obtained\nresults leads to the conclusion that the size effect of the phase diagrams,\nspontaneous polarization and PME coefficient is rather sensitive to the\nparticle sizes aspect ratio in the polarization direction, and less sensitive\nto the absolute values of the sizes per se.\n", "  Often, perhaps not often enough, we choose Common Off the Shelf (COTS)\nsoftware for integration in our systems. These range from repositories to\ndatabases and tools we use on a daily basis. It is very hard to assess the\neffectiveness of these choices. While none of us would consider a project\nspecific word processing solution when LaTeX (or even Word) many will consider\nwriting their own data management systems. We will look at some of the COTS we\nhave used and attempt to explain how we came to the decision and if it was\nworth it.\n", "  Recent laboratory measurements have confirmed that chemical desorption\n(desorption of products due to exothermic surface reactions) can be an\nefficient process. The impact of including this process into gas-grain chemical\nmodels entirely depends on the formalism used and the associated parameters.\nAmong these parameters, binding energies are probably the most uncertain ones\nfor the moment. We propose a new model to compute binding energy of species to\nwater ice surfaces. We have also compared the model results using either the\nnew chemical desorption model proposed by Minissale et al. (2016) or the one of\nGarrod et al. (2007). The new binding energies have a strong impact on the\nformation of complex organic molecules. In addition, the new chemical\ndesorption model from Minissale produces a much smaller desorption of these\nspecies and also of methanol. Combining the two effects, the abundances of\nCH3OH and COMs observed in cold cores cannot be reproduced by astrochemical\nmodels anymore.\n", "  We offer a brief overview of the solvent-based graphene production and\nsummarize the current knowledge on the formation mechanism of graphite oxide\nthat proceeds via graphite intercalation compounds. In addition, the results of\nour in situ X-ray diffraction investigation into this process are presented,\ndiscussed and contrasted to the findings by other authors, who employed the\nsame oxidation protocol but examined the samples by ex situ X-ray diffraction.\nOur results suggest that, contrary to the numerous reports by other authors, no\nstrong crystalline order, unique to graphite intercalation compounds as well as\ngraphite oxide, develops if they remain in concentrated acid. Furthermore, it\nalso appears that, depending on the concentration, sulfuric acid molecules\nsignificantly weaken graphene-graphene interactions in graphite. Consequently,\nconcentrated sulfuric acid may be a good solvent for graphene dispersions, if\nonly there is sufficient energy input to separate the layers of graphene.\n", "  We critically review the recent debate between Doreen Fraser and David\nWallace on the interpretation of quantum field theory, with the aim of\nidentifying where the core of the disagreement lies. We show that, despite\nappearances, their conflict does not concern the existence of particles or the\noccurrence of unitarily inequivalent representations. Instead, the dispute\nultimately turns on the very definition of what a quantum field theory is. We\nfurther illustrate the fundamental differences between the two approaches by\ncomparing them both to the Bohmian program in quantum field theory.\n", "  The paper describes the investigation of the properties of silver besilicate\nsalt colloids in water medium. Ag6Si2O7 was obtained in a soft conditions, in\nwater medium, at temperatures and pressure close to room ones. The morphology\nand crystallinity of matter under investigations appear to depend on the growth\nconditions. Slow growth resulted in quasi-crystalline yellowish whiskers, while\nhigh concentration of precursors led to fast formation of the quasi-amorphous\naggregates. The elemental constitution of object under study was determined\nwith the help of Comebax-INCA set-up, and was then proved by chemical analysis.\nThe ratio of elements was close to Ag6Si2O7, and depended a little whether the\nsample was taken from the sediments of reaction or from dried residue of a\nliquid medium. The experiments in Raman technique revile several\nwell-resolvable bands in whisker-like samples, but only few of them were able\nto detect in quasi-amorphous material. In the last case the bands were broader,\nbut the positions of weak broad bands were close to the positions of\ncorresponding bands in whiskers. We can suggest, that the bands, common in two\nformer cases, are due to oscillation in bepyramidal molecules of Ag6Si2O7, and\nthe bands, seen only at whiskers, are due to long-rang order. The very special\npeculiarity was observed under chemical test with hydrochloric acid. The white\nflakes sedimentation appeared after addition of NaCl but do not appeared when\nHCl was added. This result can be explained if to assume the existence of\nsilicon acid shell around the colloidal particles of silver besilicate. The\nmodel of silicon acid shell around colloids was proved by high resolution\nelectron microscopy.\n", "  This study examines the impact that solar activity has on model results\nduring geomagnetic quiet time for the ionosphere/thermosphere models: the\nCoupled Thermosphere Ionosphere Plasmasphere Electrodynamics Model (CTIPe) and\nthe Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model\n(TIE-GCM). Using varying F10.7 flux values as a measurement of solar activity,\nthe models were run over a two-day period with the constant parameters Kp= 2,\nn= 3 cm^3, and v= 400 km/s. Four F10.7 values (70, 110, 150, and 190) were\nselected based off of the average F10.7 values for geomagnetic quiet days\nacross the current solar cycle. Our analysis of the model results showed that\nsolar activity has the greatest effect on TEC output and the least effect on\nhmF2 and O/N2 output. Overall, TIE-GCM output tends to be higher than CTIPe,\nhowever, inconsistent values across the two-day CTIPe v3.1 output suggests that\nthis model needs a longer warm-up period. When visually compared against\nobserved data, CTIPe v3.2 performs the best, although all models greatly\noverestimated values for TEC. Analyses of models during geomagnetic quiet time\nare important in establishing a baseline which can be compared against storm\ndata. An example of this was completed at the end of the study, using storm\ndata obtained from Millstone Observatory on March 17, 2013. In this analysis,\nwe found that TIE-GCM using the Weimer model to calculate the high-latitude\nelectric potential provided more accurate results. Continued research in this\narea will be useful for understanding the impact of geomagnetic storms on the\nthermosphere/ionosphere.\n", "  Several proposals exist for energy-frontier facilities after the HL-LHC. In\nthis contribution I review the potential of these facilities to perform key\nmeasurements of top quark properties and interacions. Top quark precision\nphysics at a lepton collider provides excellent opportunities for the\ndetermination of the top quark mass and its couplings to neutral electro-weak\ngauge bosons. Measurements at very high center-of-mass energy at a new hadron\ncollider likely offer the ultimate precision on the QCD interaction of the top\nquark and its coupling to the Higgs boson. The combination of a lepton and a\nhadron collider can improve the precision of all these measurements by two\norders of magnitude with respect to the current state-of-the-art and by an\norder of magnitude compared to the precision envisaged after 3/ab at the LHC.\n"]}
