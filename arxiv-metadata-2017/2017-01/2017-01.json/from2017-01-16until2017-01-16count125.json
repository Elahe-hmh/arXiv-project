The approach bases only the idea\nthat quantum state reduction has its origin in a mutual physical interaction\nbetween the states. The model is explicitly worked out for the gravitational\nreduction hypothesis of Diosi and Penrose. It agrees for typical quantum\nmechanical experiments with the projection postulate and predicts regimes in\nwhich other behavior could be observed. An outlook is given, how the new\neffects can possibly become of interest for biology. For verification a\nfeasible quantum optical experiment is proposed. The approach is analyzed from\nthe view point of quantum non-locality in concrete its consequences for\nsignalling.\n", "  A Lorentz invariant model for gravity-induced quantum state reduction is\npresented, which is mainly developed from Penrose's argument that the time\ntranslation operator in a superposition of macroscopic states is ill-defined.\nThe problem to define a Lorentz invariant stochastic dynamics for the\nwave-function is solved by assuming that the stochastic time flow is running\northogonal to the deterministic, unitary time evolution inside the\nfour-dimensional space-time, which makes the direction of causality independent\nfrom the chosen reference frame. This new view allows to accept Bell's position\non the implication of quantum non-locality on relativity, without having to\ngive up the Lorentz invariance of the specified dynamics. It is shown that it\nis possible to formulate on the basis of this new view a meaningful physical\nmodel. The model is also checked for possible higher order effects, which\nprovide new starting points for experimental research.\n", "  The physics of the 20th Century is governed by two pillars, Einstein's\nrelativity principle and the quantum principle. At the beginning of the 21st\nCentury, it becomes clear that there exist the smallest units of matter, such\nas electrons, neutrinos, and quarks; their behaviors are described by the\nStandard Model.\n  It was believed that the temperature of the early Universe was once 300 GeV,\nor higher, at $10^{-11} sec$, and then going through the electroweak phase\ntransition. But the mass phase transition happens in the purely imaginary\ntemperature. Later on, its temperature was 150 MeV at $3.3 \\times 10^{-5} sec$,\nand then going through the \"QCD cosmological phase transition\". We attempt to\nuse the Standard Model, a completely dimensionless theory apart from the\nnegative \"ignition\" term, to conclude that the EW or mass phase transition {\\it\ndoes not exist}.\n  On the front of QCD cosmological phase transition, the intriguing question\nabout the latent heat (energy) is discussed and its role is speculated.\n", "  We discuss how an eigenvalue perturbation formula for transfer operators of\ndynamical systems is related to exponential hitting time distributions and\nextreme value theory for processes generated by chaotic dynamical systems. We\nalso list a number of piecewise expanding systems to which this general theory\napplies and discuss the prospects to apply this theory to some classes of\npiecewise hyperbolic systems.\n", "  We study bifurcations of invariant graphs in skew product dynamical systems\ndriven by hyperbolic surface maps T like Anosov surface diffeomorphisms or\nbaker maps and with one-dimensional concave fibre maps under multiplicative\nforcing when the forcing is scaled by a parameter r=e^{-t}. For a range of\nparameters two invariant graphs (a trivial and a non-trivial one) coexist, and\nwe use thermodynamic formalism to characterize the parameter dependence of the\nHausdorff and packing dimension of the set of points where both graphs\ncoincide. As a corollary we characterize the parameter dependence of the\ndimension of the global attractor A_t: Hausdorff and packing dimension have a\ncommon value dim(A_t), and there is a critical parameter t_c determined by the\nSRB measure of T^{-1} such that dim(A_t)=3 for t < t_c and t --> dim(A_t) is\nstrictly decreasing for t_c < t < t_{max}.\n", "  We study skew product systems driven by a hyperbolic base map S (e.g. a baker\nmap or an Anosov surface diffeomorphism) and with simple concave fibre maps on\nan interval [0,a] like h(x)=g(\\theta) tanh(x) where g(\\theta) is a factor\ndriven by the base map. The fibre-wise attractor is the graph of an upper\nsemicontinuous function \\phi(\\theta). For many choices of the function g, \\phi\nhas a residual set of zeros but \\phi>0 almost everywhere w.r.t. the\nSinai-Ruelle-Bowen measure of S^(-1).\n  In such situations we evaluate the stability index of the global attractor of\nthe system, which is the subgraph of \\phi, at all regular points (\\theta,0) in\nterms of the local exponents \\Gamma(\\theta):=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 1/n log\ng_n(\\theta) and \\Lambda(\\theta):=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} 1/n\\log|D_u S^{-n}(\\theta)|\nand of the positive zero s_* of a certain thermodynamic pressure function\nassociated with S^(-1) and g. (In queuing theory, an analogon of s_* is known\nas Loyne's exponent.)\n  The stability index was introduced by Podvigina and Ashwin in 2011 to\nquantify the local scaling of basins of attraction.\n", "  We quantify the asymptotic vanishing of the ground-state overlap of two\nnon-interacting Fermi gases in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space in the\nthermodynamic limit. Given two one-particle Schr\\\"odinger operators in\nfinite-volume which differ by a compactly supported bounded potential, we prove\na power-law upper bound on the ground-state overlap of the corresponding\nnon-interacting $N$-particle systems. We interpret the decay exponent $\\gamma$\nin terms of scattering theory and find $\\gamma = \\pi^{-2}{\\lVert\\arcsin{\\lvert\nT_E/2\\rvert}\\rVert}_{\\mathrm{HS}}^2$, where $T_E$ is the transition matrix at\nthe Fermi energy $E$. This exponent reduces to the one predicted by Anderson\n[Phys. Rev. 164, 352-359 (1967)] for the exact asymptotics in the special case\nof a repulsive point-like perturbation.\n", "  We study the spectrum of one dimensional integral operators in bounded real\nintervals of length $2L$, for value of $L$ large. The integral operators are\nobtained by linearizing a non local evolution equation for a non conserved\norder parameter describing the phases of a fluid. We prove a Perron-Frobenius\ntheorem showing that there is an isolated, simple minimal eigenvalue strictly\npositive for $L$ finite, going to zero exponentially fast in $L$. We lower\nbound, uniformly on $L$, the spectral gap by applying a generalization of the\nCheeger's inequality. These results are usefulfor deriving spectral properties\nfor non local Cahn-Hilliard type of equations in problems of interface\ndynamics.\n", "  A Fermi liquid with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is expected to support a new\nkind of collective modes: oscillations of magnetization in the absence of the\nmagnetic field. We show that these modes are damped by the electron-electron\ninteraction even in the limit of an infinitely long wavelength (q = 0). The\nlinewidth of the collective mode is on the order of {\\Delta}^2=E_F , where\n{\\Delta} is a characteristic spin-orbit energy splitting and E_F is the Fermi\nenergy. Such damping is in a stark contrast to known damping mechanisms of both\ncharge and spin collective modes in the absence of SOC, all of which disappear\nat q = 0, and arises because none of the components of total spin is conserved\nin the presence of SOC.\n", "  We derive a selection rule among the $(1+1)$-dimensional SU(2)\nWess-Zumino-Witten theories, based on the global anomaly of the discrete\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry found by Gepner and Witten. In the presence of both the\nSU(2) and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, a renormalization-group flow is possible\nbetween level-$k$ and level-$k'$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theories only if $k\\equiv\nk' \\mod{2}$. This classifies the Lorentz-invariant, SU(2)-symmetric critical\nbehavior into two \"symmetry-protected\" categories corresponding to even and odd\nlevels,restricting possible gapless critical behavior of translation-invariant\nquantum spin chains.\n", "  In an analysis of the US, the UK, and the German stock market we find a\nchange in the behavior based on the stock's beta values. Before 2006 risky\ntrades were concentrated on stocks in the IT and technology sector. Afterwards\nrisky trading takes place for stocks from the financial sector. We show that an\nagent-based model can reproduce these changes. We further show that the initial\nimpulse for the transition might stem from the increase of high frequency\ntrading at that time.\n", "  This paper gives a rigorous proof of a conjectured statistical\nself-similarity property of the eigenvalues random matrices from the Circular\nUnitary Ensemble. We consider on the one hand the eigenvalues of an $n \\times\nn$ CUE matrix, and on the other hand those eigenvalues $e^{i\\phi}$ of an $mn\n\\times mn$ CUE matrix with $|\\phi| \\le \\pi / m$, rescaled to fill the unit\ncircle. We show that for a large range of mesoscopic scales, these collections\nof points are statistically indistinguishable for large $n$. The proof is based\non a comparison theorem for determinantal point processes which may be of\nindependent interest.\n", "  Our knowledge of the ground state of underdoped hole-doped cuprates has\nevolved considerably over the last few years. There is now compelling evidence\nthat inside the pseudogap phase, charge order breaks translational symmetry\nleading to a reconstructed Fermi surface made of small pockets. Quantum\noscillations, [Doiron-Leyraud N, et al. (2007) Nature 447:564-568], optical\nconductivity [Mirzaei SI, et al. (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110:5774-5778]\nand the validity of Wiedemann-Franz law [Grissonnache G, et al. (2016) Phys.\nRev. B 93:064513] point to a Fermi liquid regime at low temperature in the\nunderdoped regime. However, the observation of a quadratic temperature\ndependence in the electrical resistivity at low temperatures, the hallmark of a\nFermi liquid regime, is still missing. Here, we report magnetoresistance\nmeasurements in the magnetic-field-induced normal state of underdoped\nYBa_2Cu_4O_8 which are consistent with a T^2 resistivity extending down to 1.5\nK. The magnitude of the T^2 coefficient, however, is much smaller than expected\nfor a single pocket of the mass and size observed in quantum oscillations,\nimplying that the reconstructed Fermi surface must consist of at least one\nadditional pocket.\n", "  Following our previous work wherein the leading order effective action was\ncomputed in the covariant effective field theory of gravity, here we specialize\nthe effective action to the FRW spacetime and obtain the effective Friedmann\nequations. In particular, we focus our attention on studying the cosmological\nimplications of the non-local terms when each of them is combined with the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. We obtain both analytical and iterative solutions to\nthe effective background equations in all the cases and also briefly comment on\nthe consistency between the iterative and numerical solutions whenever\npossible. We find that among all the non-local terms, the imprints induced by\n$R\\frac{1}{\\square^2}R$ are very significant. Interpreting these corrections as\nan effective dark energy component characterized by an equation of state\nparameter, we find that the $R\\frac{1}{\\square^2}R$ correction can indeed lead\nto an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch even in the\nabsence of a cosmological constant. We briefly discuss some phenomenological\nconsequences of our results.\n", "  In modern computers, computation is performed by assembling together sets of\nlogic gates. Popular gates like AND, OR, XOR, processing two logic inputs and\nyielding one logic output, are often addressed as irreversible logic gates\nwhere the sole knowledge of the output logic value, is not sufficient to infer\nthe logic value of the two inputs. Such gates are usually believed to be\nbounded to dissipate a finite minimum amount of energy determined by the\ninput-output information difference. Here we show that this is not necessarily\nthe case, by presenting an experiment where a OR logic gate, realized with a\nmicro electromechanical cantilever, is operated with energy well below the\nexpected limit, provided the operation is slow enough and frictional phenomena\nare properly addressed.\n", "  We analyze a method to produce pairs of non independent Poisson processes\n$M(t),N(t)$ from positively correlated, self-decomposable, exponential\nrenewals. In particular the present paper provides the family of copulas\npairing the renewals, along with the closed form for the joint distribution\n$p_{m,n}(s,t)$ of the pair $\\big(M(s),N(t)\\big)$, an outcome which turns out to\nbe instrumental to produce explicit algorithms for applications in finance and\nqueuing theory. We finally discuss the cross-correlation properties of the two\nprocesses and the relative timing of their jumps\n", "  Experimental efforts to measure neutrinos by radio-frequency (RF) signals\nresulting from neutrino interactions in-ice have intensified over the last\ndecade. Recent calculations indicate that one may dramatically improve the\nsensitivity of ultra-high energy (\"UHE\"; >EeV) neutrino experiments via\ndetection of radio waves trapped along the air-ice surface. Detectors designed\nto observe the \"Askaryan effect\" currently search for RF electromagnetic pulses\npropagating through bulk ice, and could therefore gain sensitivity if signals\nare confined to the ice-air boundary. To test the feasibilty of this scenario,\nmeasurements of the complex radio-frequency properties of several\nair-dielectric interfaces were performed for a variety of materials.\nTwo-dimensional surfaces of granulated fused silica (sand), both in the lab as\nwell as occurring naturally, water doped with varying concentrations of salt,\nnatural rock salt formations, granulated salt and ice itself were studied, both\nin North America and also Antarctica. In no experiment do we observe\nunambiguous surface wave propagation, as would be evidenced by signals\ntravelling with reduced signal loss and/or superluminal velocities, compared to\nconventional EM wave propagation.\n", "  We study the effects of filaments on galaxy properties in the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 using filaments from the `Cosmic Web\nReconstruction' catalogue (Chen et al. 2016), a publicly available filament\ncatalogue for SDSS. Since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high density\nregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment are\ndependent on the distance to the nearest filament. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat a red galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than\na blue or low-mass galaxy. After adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on\naverage, early-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to\nfilaments than late-forming galaxies or small galaxies. For the Main galaxy\nsample (MGS), all signals are very significant ($>6\\sigma$). For the LOWZ and\nCMASS sample, the stellar mass and size are significant ($>2 \\sigma$). The\nfilament effects we observe persist until $z = 0.7$ (the edge of the CMASS\nsample). Comparing our results to those using the galaxy distances from\nredMaPPer galaxy clusters as a reference, we find a similar result between\nfilaments and clusters. Moreover, we find that the effect of clusters on the\nstellar mass of nearby galaxies depends on the galaxy's filamentary\nenvironment. Our findings illustrate the strong correlation of galaxy\nproperties with proximity to density ridges, strongly supporting the claim that\ndensity ridges are good tracers of filaments.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of a multilevel bistable system coupled\nto a bosonic heat bath beyond the perturbative regime. We consider different\nspectral densities of the bath, in the transition from sub-Ohmic to super-Ohmic\ndissipation, and different cutoff frequencies. The study is carried out by\nusing the real-time path integral approach of the Feynman-Vernon influence\nfunctional. We find that, in the crossover dynamical regime characterized by\ndamped \\emph{intrawell} oscillations and incoherent tunneling, the short time\nbehavior and the time scales of the relaxation starting from a nonequilibrium\ninitial condition depend nontrivially on the spectral properties of the heat\nbath.\n", "  The Borrmann effect is the anomalous transmission of x rays in perfect\ncrystals under diffraction conditions. It arises from the interference of the\nincident and diffracted waves, which creates a standing wave with nodes at\nstrongly absorbing atoms. Dipolar absorption of x rays is thus diminished,\nwhich makes the crystal nearly transparent for certain x-ray wave vectors.\nIndeed, a relative enhancement of electric quadrupole absorption via the\nBorrmann effect has been demonstrated recently. Here we show that the Borrmann\neffect has a significantly larger impact on resonant x-ray emission than is\nobservable in x-ray absorption. Emission from a dipole forbidden intermediate\nstate may even dominate the corresponding x-ray spectra. Our work extends the\ndomain of x-ray standing wave methods to resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy\nand provides means for novel spectroscopic experiments in d- and f-electron\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper we are concerned with the simulation of crowds in built\nenvironments, where obstacles play a role in the dynamics and in the\ninteractions among pedestrians. First of all, we review the state-of-the-art of\nthe techniques for handling obstacles in numerical simulations. Then, we\nintroduce a new modelling technique which guarantees both impermeability and\nopacity of the obstacles, and does not require ad hoc runtime interventions to\navoid collisions. Most important, we solve a complex optimization problem by\nmeans of the Particle Swarm Optimization method in order to exploit the\nso-called Braess's paradox. More precisely, we reduce the evacuation time from\na room by adding in the walking area multiple obstacles optimally placed and\nshaped.\n", "  Relativistic electrons, accelerated by the laser ponderomotive force, can be\nfocused onto a high-Z convertor to generate high-brightness beams of\ngamma-rays, which in turn can be used to induce photonuclear reactions. In this\nwork, the possibility of photo-transmutation of long-lived radionuclide Cs-135\nby laser-plasma driven electron source has been demonstrated through Geant4\nsimulations. High energy electron generation, bremsstrahlung and photonuclear\nreaction have been observed at four different laser intensities of 10^{20}\nW/cm^2, 5 times 10^{20} W/cm^2, 10^{21} W/cm^2 and 5 times 10^{21} W/cm^2,\nrespectively. It was shown that the laser intensity and the target geometry\nhave strong effect on the transmutation reaction yield. At different laser\nintensities the recommended target sizes were found to obtain the maximum\nreaction yield. The remarkable feature of this work is to evaluate the optimal\nlaser intensity to produce maximum reaction yield of 10^8 per Joule in laser\npulse energy, which is 10^{21} W/cm^2. Our study suggests photo-transmutation\ndriven by laser-based electron source as a promising approach for experimental\nresearch into transmutation reactions, with potential applications to nuclear\nwaste management.\n", "  Terahertz (THz) fields are widely applied for sensing, communication and\nquality control. In future applications, they could be efficiently confined,\nenhanced and manipulated - well below the classical diffraction limit - through\nthe excitation of graphene plasmons (GPs). These possibilities emerge from the\nstrongly reduced GP wavelength, lp, compared to the photon wavelength, l0,\nwhich can be controlled by modulating the carrier density of graphene via\nelectrical gating. Recently, GPs in a graphene-insulator-metal configuration\nhave been predicted to exhibit a linear dispersion (thus called acoustic\nplasmons) and a further reduced wavelength, implying an improved field\nconfinement, analogous to plasmons in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)\nnear conductive substrates. While infrared GPs have been visualised by\nscattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), the real-space\nimaging of strongly confined THz plasmons in graphene and 2DEGs has been\nelusive so far - only GPs with nearly free-space wavelength have been observed.\nHere we demonstrate real-space imaging of acoustic THz plasmons in a graphene\nphotodetector with split-gate architecture. To that end, we introduce\nnanoscale-resolved THz photocurrent near-field microscopy, where near-field\nexcited GPs are detected thermoelectrically rather than optically. The on-chip\nGP detection simplifies GP imaging, as sophisticated s-SNOM detection schemes\ncan be avoided. The photocurrent images reveal strongly reduced GP wavelengths\n(lp = l0/66), a linear dispersion resulting from the coupling of GPs with the\nmetal gate below the graphene, and that plasmon damping at positive carrier\ndensities is dominated by Coulomb impurity scattering. Acoustic GPs could thus\nstrongly benefit the development of deep subwavelength-scale THz devices.\n", "  The need for secrecy and security is essential in communication. Secret\nsharing is a conventional protocol to distribute a secret message to a group of\nparties, who cannot access it individually but need to cooperate in order to\ndecode it. While several variants of this protocol have been investigated,\nincluding realizations using quantum systems, the security of quantum secret\nsharing schemes still remains unproven almost two decades after their original\nconception. Here we establish an unconditional security proof for continuous\nvariable entanglement-based quantum secret sharing schemes, in the limit of\nasymptotic keys and for an arbitrary number of players. We tackle the problem\nby resorting to the recently developed one-sided device-independent approach to\nquantum key distribution. We demonstrate theoretically the feasibility of our\nscheme, which can be implemented by Gaussian states and homodyne measurements,\nwith no need for ideal single-photon sources or quantum memories. Our results\ncontribute to validating quantum secret sharing as a viable primitive for\nquantum technologies.\n", "  We examine the experimental and theoretical electron-energy loss spectra in\n2$H$-Cu$_{0.2}$NbS$_2$ and find that the 1 eV plasmon in this material does not\nexhibit the regular positive quadratic plasmon dispersion that would be\nexpected for a normal broad-parabolic-band system. Instead we find a nearly\nnon-dispersing plasmon in the momentum-transfer range $q<0.35$ \\AA$^{-1}$. We\nargue that for a stoichiometric pure 2$H$-NbS$_2$ the dispersion relation is\nexpected to have a negative slope as is the case for other transition-metal\ndichalcogenides. The presence of Cu impurities, required to stabilize the\ncrystal growth, tends to shift the negative plasmon dispersion into a positive\none, but the doping level in the current system is small enough to result in a\nnearly-non-dispersing plasmon. We conclude that a negative-slope plasmon\ndispersion is not connected with the existence of a charge-density-wave order\nin transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  For the inelastic diffraction, we obtain an upper bound valid in the whole\nrange of the elastic scattering amplitude variation allowed by unitarity. We\ndiscuss the energy dependence of the inelastic diffractive cross-section on the\nbase of this bound and recent LHC data.\n", "  Interfacial boundary conditions determined from empirical or ad-hoc models\nremain the standard approach to model fluid flows over porous media, even in\nsituations where the topology of the porous medium is known. We propose a\nnon-empirical and accurate method to compute the effective boundary conditions\nat the interface between a porous surface and an overlying flow. Using\nmultiscale expansion (homogenization) approach, we derive a tensorial\ngeneralized version of the empirical condition suggested by Beavers & Joseph\n(1967). The components of the tensors determining the effective slip velocity\nat the interface are obtained by solving a set of Stokes equations in a small\ncomputational domain near the interface containing both free flow and porous\nmedium. Using the lid-driven cavity flow with a porous bed, we demonstrate that\nthe derived boundary condition is accurate and robust by comparing an effective\nmodel to direct numerical simulations. Finally, we provide an open source code\nthat solves the microscale problems and computes the velocity boundary\ncondition without free parameters over any porous bed.\n", "  A bistable micro-mechanical system based on magnetic repulsion is presented\nexploring its applicability as memory unit where the state of the bit is\nencoded in the rest position of a deflected cantilever. The non-linearity\ninduced on the cantilever can be tuned through the magnetic interaction\nintensity between the cantilever magnet and the counter magnet in terms of\ngeometrical parameters. A simple model provides a sound prediction of the\nbehavior of the system. Finally we measured the energy required to store a bit\nof information on the system that, for the considered protocols, is bounded by\nthe energy barrier separating the two stable states.\n", "  Scenario for restoration of the real part of the elastic scattering amplitude\nhas been proposed for the unitarity saturation case. Dependence of the real\npart of the elastic scattering amplitude on the transferred momentum $-t$ at\nthe asymptotical energies has been restored from the corresponding imaginary\npart on the basis of derivative analyticity relations (analytization\nprocedure).\n", "  During a systematic search for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) not in\ngalactic nuclei, we identified the compact symmetric radio source B3 1715+425\nwith an emission-line galaxy offset ~ 8.5 kpc from the nucleus of the brightest\ncluster galaxy (BCG) in the redshift $z = 0.1754$ cluster ZwCl 8193. B3\n1715+425 is too bright (brightness temperature $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{10}$ K at\nobserving frequency 7.6 GHz) and too luminous (1.4 GHz luminosity $\\sim\n10^{25}$ W/Hz) to be powered by anything but a SMBH, but its host galaxy is\nmuch smaller ($\\sim 0.9$ kpc $\\times$ 0.6 kpc full width between half-maximum\npoints) and optically fainter (R-band absolute magnitude $\\sim -18.2$) than any\nother radio galaxy. Its high radial velocity $\\sim 1860$ km/s relative to the\nBCG, continuous ionized wake extending back to the BCG nucleus, and surrounding\ndebris indicate that the radio galaxy was tidally shredded passing through the\nBCG core, leaving a nearly naked supermassive black hole fleeing from the BCG\nwith space velocity $> 2000$ km/s. The radio galaxy has mass $< 6 \\times 10^9$\nsolar masses and infrared luminosity $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{11}$ solar luminosities\nclose to its dust Eddington limit, so it is vulnerable to further mass loss\nfrom radiative feedback.\n", "  Photoelectron circular dichroism refers to the forward/backward asymmetry in\nthe photoelectron angular distribution with respect to the propagation axis of\ncircularly polarized light. It has recently been demonstrated in femtosecond\nmulti-photon photoionization experiments with randomly oriented camphor and\nfenchone molecules [C. Lux et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51, 5001 (2012);C. S.\nLehmann et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234307 (2013)]. A theoretical framework\ndescribing this process as (2+1) resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization is\nconstructed, which consists of two-photon photoselection from randomly oriented\nmolecules and successive one-photon ionisation of the photoselected molecules.\nIt combines perturbation theory for the light-matter interaction with ab initio\ncalculations for the two-photon absorption and a single-center expansion of the\nphotoelectron wavefunction in terms of hydrogenic continuum functions. It is\nverified that the model correctly reproduces the basic symmetry behavior\nexpected under exchange of handedness and light helicity. When applied it to\nfenchone and camphor, semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is\nfound, for which a sufficient d wave character of the electronically excited\nintermediate state is crucial.\n", "  We introduce a Weyl term into the Einstein-Maxwell-Axion theory in four\ndimensional spacetime. Up to the first order of the Weyl coupling parameter\n$\\gamma$, we construct charged black brane solutions without translational\ninvariance in a perturbative manner. Among all the holographic frameworks\ninvolving higher derivative gravity, we are the first to obtain metal-insulator\ntransitions (MIT) when varying the system parameters at zero temperature.\nFurthermore, we study the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) of strip\ngeometry in this model and find that the second order derivative of HEE with\nrespect to the axion parameter exhibits maximization behavior near quantum\ncritical points (QCPs) of MIT. It testifies the conjecture in 1502.03661 and\n1604.04857 that HEE itself or its derivatives can be used to diagnose quantum\nphase transition (QPT).\n", "  We study Earth matter effect in oscillation of supernovae neutrinos. We show\nthat detecting Earth matter effect gives an independent measurement of spectra\nof supernovae neutrinos, i.e. the flavor difference of the spectra of\nsupernovae neutrinos. We study the effect of energy resolution and angular\nresolution of final electron or positron on detecting the signal of Earth\nmatter effect. We show that varying the widths of energy bins in analysis can\nchange the signal strength of Earth matter effect and the statistical\nfluctuation. A reasonable choice of energy bins can both suppress the\nstatistical fluctuation and make out a good signal strength relative to the\nstatistical fluctuation. Neutrino detectors with good energy resolution and\ngood angular resolution are therefore preferred so that there are more freedom\nto vary energy bins and to optimize the signal of Earth matter effect in\nanalyzing events of supernovae neutrinos.\n", "  As several large single-dish radio surveys begin operation within the coming\ndecade, a wealth of radio data will become available and provide a new window\nto the Universe. In order to fully exploit the potential of these data sets, it\nis important to understand the systematic effects associated with the\ninstrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to\nforward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data\nproducts. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source\nPython packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and\nEmission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio\nsurvey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio\nsignals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level\ntime-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and\naims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used\nseparately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible\nnature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe\nthe basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and\nRFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI\nmitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE & SEEK to forward-model a Galactic\nsurvey in the frequency range 990 - 1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien\nObservatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and\nachieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 - 6 in the cleanest\nchannels including systematic uncertainties. However, we also point out the\npotential challenges of high RFI contamination and baseline removal when\nexamining the early data from the Bleien Observatory.\n", "  Quantum electronic devices at the single impurity level demand an\nunderstanding of the physical attributes of dopants at an unprecedented\naccuracy. Germanium-based technologies have been developed recently, creating a\nnecessity to adapt the latest theoretical tools to the unique electronic\nstructure of this material. We investigate basic properties of donors in Ge\nwhich are not known experimentally, but are indispensable for qubit\nimplementations. Our approach provides a description of the wavefunction at\nmultiscale, associating microscopic information from Density Functional Theory\nand envelope functions from state of the art multivalley effective mass\ncalculations, including a central cell correction designed to reproduce the\nenergetics of all group V donor species (P, As, Sb and Bi). With this\nformalism, we predict the binding energies of negatively ionized donors (D-\nstate). Furthermore, we investigate the signatures of buried donors to be\nexpected from Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The naive assumption that\nattributes of donor electrons in other semiconductors may be extrapolated to Ge\nis shown to fail, similar to earlier attempts to recreate in Si qubits designed\nfor GaAs. Our results suggest that the mature techniques available for qubit\nrealizations may be adapted to germanium to some extent, but the peculiarities\nof the Ge band structure will demand new ideas for fabrication and control.\n", "  Clean topological insulators exposed to a magnetic field develop Landau\nlevels accompanied by a nonzero Hall conductivity for the infinite slab\ngeometry. In this work we consider the case of disordered topological insulator\nnanowires and find, in contrast, that a zero Hall plateau emerges within a\nbroad energy window close to the Dirac point. We numerically calculate the\nconductance and its distribution for a statistical ensemble of disordered\nnanowires, and use the conductance fluctuations to study the dependence of the\ninsulating phase on system parameters, such as the nanowire length, disorder\nstrength and the magnetic field.\n", "  Geometric methods for constructing exact solutions of motion equations with\nfirst order $\\alpha ^{\\prime}$ corrections to the heterotic supergravity action\nimplying a non-trivial Yang-Mills sector and six dimensional, 6-d,\nalmost-K\\\"ahler internal spaces are studied. In 10-d spacetimes, general\nparametrizations for generic off-diagonal metrics, nonlinear and linear\nconnections and matter sources, when the equations of motion decouple in very\ngeneral forms are considered. This allows us to construct a variety of exact\nsolutions when the coefficients of fundamental geometric/physical objects\ndepend on all higher dimensional spacetime coordinates via corresponding\nclasses of generating and integration functions, generalized effective sources\nand integration constants. Such generalized solutions are determined by generic\noff-diagonal metrics and nonlinear and/or linear connections. In particular, as\nconfigurations which are warped/compactified to lower dimensions and for\nLevi-Civita connections. The corresponding metrics can have (non) Killing\nand/or Lie algebra symmetries and/or describe (1+2)-d and/or (1+3)-d domain\nwall configurations, with possible warping nearly almost-K\\\"ahler manifolds,\nwith gravitational and gauge instantons for nonlinear vacuum configurations and\neffective polarizations of cosmological and interaction constants encoding\nstring gravity effects. A series of examples of exact solutions describing\ngeneric off-diagonal supergravity modifications to black hole/ ellipsoid and\nsolitonic configurations are provided and analyzed. We prove that it is\npossible to reproduce the Kerr and other type black solutions in general\nrelativity (with certain types of string corrections) in 4-d and to generalize\nthe solutions to non-vacuum configurations in (super) gravity/ string theories.\n", "  In the past years, magnetism-driven ferroelectricity and gigantic\nmagnetoelectric effects have been reported for a number of frustrated magnets\nwith spiral magnetic orders. Such materials are of high current interest due to\ntheir potential for spintronics and low-power magnetoelectric devices. However,\ntheir low magnetic order temperatures (typically <100K) greatly restrict their\nfields of application. Here we demonstrate that the stability domain of the\nspiral phase in the perovskite YBaCuFeO5 can be enlarged by more than 150K\nthrough a controlled manipulation of the Fe/Cu chemical disorder. Moreover we\nshow that this novel mechanism can stabilize the magnetic spiral state of\nYBaCuFeO5 above the symbolic value of 25{\\deg}C at zero magnetic field. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the properties of a magnetic spiral, including its\nwavelength and stability range, can be engineered through the control of\nchemical disorder, offering a great potential for the design of materials with\nmagnetoelectric properties beyond room temperature.\n", "  We consider the slow light propagation in an atomic medium with a tripod\nlevel scheme. We show that the coexistence of two types of dark-state\npolaritons leads to the propagation dynamics, which is qualitatively different\nfrom that in a $\\Lambda $-medium, and allows therefore for very efficient\nconversion of signal photons into spin excitations. This efficiency is shown to\nbe very close to 1 even for very long signal light pulses, which could not be\nentirely compressed into a Lambda-medium at a comparable strength of the\ncontrol field.\n", "  A time-dependent angular analysis of $B_s^0\\to\\psi(2S)\\phi$ decays is\nperformed using data recorded by the LHCb experiment. The data set corresponds\nto an integrated luminosity of 3.0\\invfb collected during Run 1 of the LHC. The\nCP-violating phase and decay-width difference of the $B_s^0$ system are\nmeasured to be $\\phi_s = 0.23^{+0.29}_{-0.28} \\pm 0.02$ rad and $\\Delta\\Gamma_s\n= 0.066^{+0.041}_{-0.044} \\pm 0.007$ ps$^{-1}$, respectively, where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This is the first time\nthat $\\phi_s$ and $\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ have been measured in a decay containing the\n$\\psi(2S)$ resonance.\n", "  X-ray diffraction was employed to study the evolution of the charge density\nwave (CDW) in CuxTiSe2 as a function of copper intercalation in order to\nclarify the relationship between the CDW and superconductivity. The results\nshow a CDW incommensuration arising at an intercalation value coincident with\nthe onset of superconductivity at around x=0.055(5). Additionally, it was found\nthat the charge density wave persists to higher intercalant concentrations than\npreviously assumed, demonstrating that the CDW does not terminate inside the\nsuperconducting dome. A charge density wave peak was observed in samples up to\nx=0.091(6), the highest copper concentration examined in this study. The phase\ndiagram established in this work suggests that charge density wave\nincommensuration may play a role in the formation of the superconducting state.\n", "  On September 14, 2015 the Advanced LIGO detectors observed their first\ngravitational-wave (GW) transient GW150914. This was followed by a second GW\nevent observed on December 26, 2015. Both events were inferred to have arisen\nfrom the merger of black holes in binary systems. Such a system may emit\nneutrinos if there are magnetic fields and disk debris remaining from the\nformation of the two black holes. With the surface detector array of the Pierre\nAuger Observatory we can search for neutrinos with energy above 100 PeV from\npoint-like sources across the sky with equatorial declination from about -65\ndeg. to +60 deg., and in particular from a fraction of the 90% confidence-level\n(CL) inferred positions in the sky of GW150914 and GW151226. A targeted search\nfor highly-inclined extensive air showers, produced either by interactions of\ndownward-going neutrinos of all flavors in the atmosphere or by the decays of\ntau leptons originating from tau-neutrino interactions in the Earth's crust\n(Earth-skimming neutrinos), yielded no candidates in the Auger data collected\nwithin $\\pm 500$ s around or 1 day after the coordinated universal time (UTC)\nof GW150914 and GW151226, as well as in the same search periods relative to the\nUTC time of the GW candidate event LVT151012. From the non-observation we\nconstrain the amount of energy radiated in ultrahigh-energy neutrinos from such\nremarkable events.\n", "  I address the problem of explaining why wave functions for identical\nparticles must be either symmetric or antisymmetric (the symmetry dichotomy)\nwithin two interpretations of quantum mechanics which include particles\nfollowing definite trajectories in addition to, or in lieu of, the wave\nfunction: Bohmian mechanics and Newtonian quantum mechanics (a.k.a. many\ninteracting worlds). In both cases I argue that, if the interpretation is\nformulated properly, the symmetry dichotomy can be derived and need not be\npostulated.\n", "  We consider non-relativistic \"dark\" particles interacting through gauge boson\nexchange. At finite temperature, gauge exchange is modified in many ways:\nvirtual corrections lead to Debye screening; real corrections amount to\nfrequent scatterings of the heavy particles on light plasma constituents;\nmixing angles change. In a certain temperature and energy range, these effects\nare of order unity. Taking them into account in a resummed form, we estimate\nthe near-threshold spectrum of kinetically equilibrated annihilating TeV scale\nparticles. Weakly bound states are shown to \"melt\" below freeze-out, whereas\nwith attractive strong interactions, relevant e.g. for gluinos, bound states\nboost the annihilation rate by a factor 4...80 with respect to the Sommerfeld\nestimate, thereby perhaps helping to avoid overclosure of the universe.\nModestly non-degenerate dark sector masses and a way to combine the\ncontributions of channels with different gauge and spin structures are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The relativistic heavy-ion collisions create both hot quark-gluon matter and\nstrong magnetic fields, and provide an arena to study the interplay between\nquantum chromodynamics and quantum electrodynamics. In recent years, it has\nbeen shown that such an interplay can generate a number of interesting quantum\nphenomena in hadronic and quark-gluon matter. In this short review, we first\ndiscuss some properties of the magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions and then\ngive an overview of the magnetic field-induced novel quantum effects. In\nparticular, we focus on the magnetic effect on the heavy flavor mesons, the\nheavy-quark transports, and the phenomena closely related to chiral anomaly.\n", "  Quantum information protected by the topology of the storage medium is\nexpected to exhibit long coherence times. Another feature are topologically\nprotected gates generated through braiding of Majorana bound states. However,\nbraiding requires structures with branched topological segments which have\ninherent difficulties in the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures now\nbelieved to host Majorana bound states. In this paper, we construct quantum\nbits taking advantage of the topological protection and non-local properties of\nMajorana bound states in a network of parallel wires, but without relying on\nbraiding for quantum gates. The elementary unit is made from three topological\nwires, two wires coupled by a trivial superconductor and the third acting as an\ninterference arm. Coulomb blockade of the combined wires spawns a\nfractionalized spin, non-locally addressable by quantum dots used for\nsingle-qubit readout, initialization, and manipulation. We describe how the\nsame tools allow for measurement-based implementation of the Clifford gates, in\ntotal making the architecture universal. Proof-of-principle demonstration of\ntopologically protected qubits using existing techniques is therefore within\nreach.\n", "  We develop a statistical mechanical framework, based on a variational\napproximation, to describe closed loop plectonemes. This framework incorporates\nweak helix structure dependent forces into the determination of the free energy\nand average structure of a plectoneme. Notably, due to their chiral nature,\nhelix structure dependent forces break the symmetry between left and right\nhanded supercoiling. The theoretical approach, presented here, also provides a\nsystematic way of enforcing the topological constraint of closed loop\nsupercoiling in the variational approximation. At large plectoneme lengths, by\nconsidering correlation functions in an expansion in terms of the spatial mean\ntwist density about its thermally averaged value, it can be argued that\ntopological constraint may be approximated with by replacing twist and writhe\nby their thermal averages. A Lagrange Multiplier, containing the sum of average\ntwist and writhe, can be added to the free energy to conveniently inforce this\nresult. The average writhe can be calculated through the thermal average of\nGauss integral in the variational approximation. Furthermore, this approach\nallows for a possible way to calculate finite size corrections due to the\ntopological constraint. Using interaction energy terms from the mean-field\nKornyshev-Leikin theory, for parameter values that correspond to weak helix\ndependent forces, we calculate the free energy, fluctuation magnitudes and mean\ngeometric parameters for the plectoneme. We see a slight asymmetry, where\ninterestingly enough left handed supercoils have looser structure than right\nhanded ones, although a lower free energy, unlike what previous ground state\ncalculations would suggest.\n", "  Time-reversal invariance places strong constraints on the properties of the\nquantum spin Hall edge. One such restriction is the inevitability of\ndissipation in a Josephson junction between two superconductors formed on such\nan edge without the presence of interaction. Interactions and spin-conservation\nbreaking are key ingredients for the realization of dissipationless ac\nJosephson effect on such quantum spin Hall edges. We present a simple quantum\nimpurity model that allows to create a dissipationless fractional Josephson\neffect on a quantum spin Hall edge. We then use this model to substantiate a\ngeneral argument that shows that any such non-dissipative Josephson effect must\nnecessarily by $8\\pi$-periodic.\n", "  In the hope of avoiding model dependence of the cosmological observables,\nphenomenological parametrizations of Cosmic Inflation have recently been\nproposed. Typically, they are expressed in terms of two parameters associated\nwith an expansion of the inflationary quantities matching the belief that\ninflation is characterized by two numbers only, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and\nthe scalar spectral index. We give different arguments and examples showing\nthat these new approaches are either not generic or insufficient to make\npredictions at the accuracy level needed by the cosmological data. We conclude\nthat disconnecting inflation from high energy physics and gravity might not be\nthe most promising way to learn about the physics of the early Universe.\n", "  The gravitational radiation emitted by a rotating magnetic dipole is\ncalculated. Formulas for the polarization amplitudes and the radiated power are\nobtained in closed forms. A comparison is made with other sources of\ngravitational and electromagnetic radiation, particularly neutron stars with\nextremely powerful magnetic fields.\n", "  Classical particle systems characterized by continuous size polydispersity,\nsuch as colloidal materials, are not straightforwardly described using\nstatistical mechanics, since fundamental issues may arise from particle\ndistinguishability. Because the mixing entropy in such systems is divergent in\nthe thermodynamic limit we show that the configurational entropy estimated from\nstandard computational approaches to characterize glassy states also diverges.\nThis reasoning would suggest that polydisperse materials cannot undergo a glass\ntransition, in contradiction to experiments. We explain that this argument\nstems from the confusion between configurations in phase space and states\ndefined by free energy minima, and propose a simple method to compute a finite\nand physically meaningful configurational entropy in continuously polydisperse\nsystems. Physically, the proposed approach relies on an effective description\nof the system as an $M^*$-component system with a finite $M^*$, for which\nfinite mixing and configurational entropies are obtained. We show how to\ndirectly determine $M^*$ from computer simulations in a range of glass-forming\nmodels with different size polydispersities, characterized by hard and soft\ninterparticle interactions, and by additive and non-additive interactions. Our\napproach provides consistent results in all cases and demonstrates that the\nconfigurational entropy of polydisperse system exists, is finite, and can be\nquantitatively estimated.\n", "  We propose a novel approach for mitigating radio frequency interference (RFI)\nsignals in radio data using the latest advances in deep learning. We employ a\nspecial type of Convolutional Neural Network, the U-Net, that enables the\nclassification of clean signal and RFI signatures in 2D time-ordered data\nacquired from a radio telescope. We train and assess the performance of this\nnetwork using the HIDE & SEEK radio data simulation and processing packages, as\nwell as early Science Verification data acquired with the 7m single-dish\ntelescope at the Bleien Observatory. We find that our U-Net implementation is\nshowing competitive accuracy to classical RFI mitigation algorithms such as\nSEEK's SumThreshold implementation. We publish our U-Net software package on\nGitHub under GPLv3 license.\n", "  Broken symmetry states in bilayer graphene in perpendicular electric\n$E_\\perp$ and in-plane magnetic $B_\\parallel$ fields are studied in the\npresence of the dynamically screened long-range Coulomb interaction and the\nsymmetry-breaking contact four-fermion interactions. The integral gap equations\nare solved numerically, and it is shown that the momentum dependence of gaps is\nessential: It diminishes by an order of magnitude the gaps compared to the case\nof momentum-independent approximation, and the obtained gap magnitudes are\nfound to agree well with existing experimental values. We derived a phase\ndiagram of bilayer graphene at the neutrality point in the plane\n$(B_\\parallel,E_\\perp)$ showing that the (canted) layer antiferromagnetic (LAF)\nstate remains a stable ground state of the system at large $B_\\parallel$. On\nthe other hand, while the LAF phase is realized at small values of $E_{\\perp}$,\nthe quantum valley Hall (QVH) phase is the ground state of the system at values\n$E_{\\perp}>E_{cr}(B_\\parallel)$, where a critical value $E_{cr}(B_\\parallel)$\nincreases with in-plane magnetic field $B_{||}$.\n", "  The ATLAS Insertable B-Layer (IBL) is the innermost layer of pixel detectors,\nand was installed in May 2014 at a radius of 3.3 cm from the beam axis, between\nthe existing Pixel detector and a new smaller radius beam-pipe. The new\ndetector, built to cope with high radiation and occupancy, is the first large\nscale application of 3D sensors and CMOS 130 nm technology. The IBL detector\nconstruction was completed within about two years (2012-2014), and the key\nfeatures and challenges met during the IBL project are presented, as well as\nits commissioning and operational experience at the LHC.\n", "  The first observation of the rare decay$B^0_s \\to \\phi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and\nevidence for $B^0 \\to \\phi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ are reported, using $pp$ collision data\nrecorded by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ and\n8~TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3{\\mbox{\\,fb}^{-1}}$. The\nbranching fractions in the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ invariant mass range\n$400<m(\\pi^+\\pi^-)<1600{\\mathrm{\\,Me\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^2}$ are $[3.48\\pm\n0.23\\pm 0.17\\pm 0.35]\\times 10^{-6}$ and $[1.82\\pm 0.25\\pm 0.41\\pm 0.14]\\times\n10^{-7}$ for $B^0_s \\to \\phi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $B^0 \\to \\phi\\pi^+\\pi^-$\nrespectively, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and from the\nnormalisation mode $B^0_s \\to \\phi\\phi $. A combined analysis of the\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$ mass spectrum and the decay angles of the final-state particles\nidentifies the exclusive decays $B^0_s \\to \\phi f_0(980) $, $B_s^0 \\to \\phi\nf_2(1270) $, and $B^0_s \\to \\phi\\rho^0$ with branching fractions of $[1.12\\pm\n0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.08}\\pm 0.11]\\times 10^{-6}$, $[0.61\\pm 0.13^{+0.12}_{-0.05}\\pm\n0.06]\\times 10^{-6}$ and $[2.7\\pm 0.7\\pm 0.2\\pm 0.2]\\times 10^{-7}$,\nrespectively.\n", "  For the 1D non-isentropic polytropic gas dynamics equations we find\nsufficient and necessary conditions for blow up of derivatives in the terms of\nCauchy data. In particular, the method allows to determine exact class of\ninitial data corresponding to globally smooth in time solution.\n", "  It has long been known that two-point functions of conformal field theory\n(CFT) are nothing but the integral kernels of intertwining operators for two\nequivalent representations of conformal algebra. Such intertwining operators\nare known to fulfill some operator identities---the intertwining relations---in\nthe representation space of conformal algebra. Meanwhile, it has been known\nthat the S-matrix operator in scattering theory is nothing but the intertwining\noperator between the Hilbert spaces of in- and out-particles. Inspired by this\nalgebraic resemblance, in this paper we develop a simple Lie-algebraic approach\nto momentum-space two-point functions of thermal CFT living on the hyperbolic\nspacetime $\\mathbb{H}^{1}\\times\\mathbb{H}^{d-1}$ by exploiting the idea of\nKerimov's intertwining operator approach to exact S-matrix. We show that in\nthermal CFT on $\\mathbb{H}^{1}\\times\\mathbb{H}^{d-1}$ the intertwining\nrelations reduce to certain linear recurrence relations for two-point functions\nin the complex momentum space. By solving these recurrence relations, we obtain\nthe momentum-space representations of advanced and retarded two-point functions\nas well as positive- and negative-frequency two-point Wightman functions for a\nscalar primary operator in arbitrary spacetime dimension $d\\geq3$.\n", "  A complete and rigorously validated open-source Python framework to automate\npoint defect calculations using density functional theory has been developed.\nThe framework provides an effective and efficient method for defect structure\ngeneration, and creation of simple yet customizable workflows to analyze defect\ncalculations. The package provides the capability to compute widely-accepted\ncorrection schemes to overcome finite-size effects, including (1) potential\nalignment, (2) image-charge correction, and (3) band filling correction to\nshallow defects. Using Si, ZnO and In$_2$O$_3$ as test examples, we demonstrate\nthe package capabilities and validate the methodology.\n", "  Transition metal compounds with the $(t_{2g})^4$ electronic configuration are\nexpected to be nonmagnetic atomic singlets both in the weakly interacting\nregime due to spin-orbit coupling, as well as in the Coulomb dominated regime\nwith oppositely aligned $L=1$ and $S=1$ angular momenta. However, starting with\nthe full multi-orbital electronic Hamiltonian, we show the low energy effective\nmagnetic Hamiltonian contains isotropic superexchange spin interactions but\nanisotropic orbital interactions. By tuning the ratio of superexchange to\nspin-orbit coupling $J_\\mathrm{SE}/\\lambda$, we obtain a phase transition from\nnonmagnetic atomic singlets to novel magnetic phases depending on the strength\nof Hund's coupling, the crystal structure and the number of active orbitals.\nSpin-orbit coupling plays a non-trivial role in generating a triplon condensate\nof weakly interacting excitations at antiferromagnetic ordering vector $\\vec\nk=\\vec \\pi$, regardless of whether the local spin interactions are\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. In the large $J_\\mathrm{SE} / \\lambda$\nregime, the localized spin and orbital moments produce anisotropic orbital\ninteractions that are frustrated or constrained even in the absence of\ngeometric frustration. Orbital frustration leads to frustration in the spin\nchannel opening up the possibility of spin-orbital liquids with both spin and\norbital entanglement.\n", "  Photoreflectance is used for the characterisation of semiconductor samples,\nusually by sweeping the monochromatized probe beam within the energy range\ncomprised between the highest value set by the pump beam and the lowest\nabsorption threshold of the sample. There is, however, no fundamental upper\nlimit for the probe beam other than the limited spectral content of the source\nand the responsivity of the detector. As long as the modulation mechanism\nbehind photoreflectance does affect the complete electronic structure of the\nmaterial under study, sweeping the probe beam upstream towards higher energies\nfrom that of the pump source is equally effective in order to probe high energy\ncritical points. This fact, up to now largely overseen, is shown experimentally\nin this work. E1 and E0+{\\Delta}0 critical points of bulk GaAs are\nunambiguously resolved using pump light of lower energy. Upstream modulation\nmay widen further applications of the technique.\n", "  We are looking for remarkable differences between predictions of the standard\nmodel and those of $t_R$ compositeness (while the $t_L$ remains elementary) in\nvarious basic $t\\bar t$ production processes, without having to make difficult\nfinal polarization analyses. We assume the presence of $q^2$ dependent form\nfactors which first suppress the $t_R$ contributions at high $q^2$, and in\naddition, may also lead to an effective $q^2$ dependent top mass. We further\nassume that these effects disappear at low $q^2$ so that there are no anomalous\ncouplings. We show that large specific differences indeed appear in the high\nenergy limits of cross sections and asymmetries in $e^-e^+$, gluon+gluon,\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ collisions and other fusion processes and that this should lead\nto a strategy for analyzing them.\n", "  Large single crystals of the pyrochlore Pr2Hf2O7 have been successfully grown\nby the floating zone technique using an optical furnace equipped with high\npower Xenon arc lamps. Structural investigations have been carried out by both\nsynchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction to establish the\ncrystallographic structure of the materials produced. The magnetic properties\nof the single crystals have been determined for magnetic fields applied along\ndifferent crystallographic axes. The results reveal that Pr2Hf2O7 is an\ninteresting material for further investigations as a frustrated magnet. The\nhigh quality of the crystals produced make them ideal for detailed\ninvestigations, especially those using neutron scattering techniques.\n", "  In response to a recently reported observation of evidence for two classes of\nType Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) distinguished by their brightness in the rest-frame\nnear ultraviolet (NUV), we search for the phenomenon in publicly available\nlight-curve data. We use the SNANA supernova analysis package to simulate SN\nIa-light curves in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Supernova Search (SDSS) and the\nSupernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) with a model of two distinct ultraviolet classes\nof SNe Ia and a conventional model with a single broad distribution of SN-Ia\nultraviolet brightnesses. We compare simulated distributions of rest-frame\ncolors with these two models to those observed in 158 SNe Ia in the SDSS and\nSNLS data. The SNLS sample of 99 SNe Ia is in clearly better agreement with a\nmodel with one class of SN Ia light curves and shows no evidence for distinct\nNUV sub-classes. The SDSS sample of 59 SNe Ia with poorer color resolution does\nnot distinguish between the two models.\n", "  The recent LHCb data for exclusive $J/\\psi$ peripheral production at 13 TeV\nmotivate an improved `NLO' analysis to estimate the gluon distribution at low\n$x$ in which we re-calculate the rapidity gap survival factors and use a more\nprecise expression for the photon flux. We comment on the difference between\nthe $k_T$ and collinear factorization approaches.\n", "  New photometric and long-slit spectroscopic observations are presented for\nNGC 7113, PGC 1852, and PGC 67207 which are three bright galaxies residing in\nlow-density environments. The surface-brightness distribution is analysed from\nthe K_S-band images taken with adaptive optics at the Gemini North Telescope\nand the ugriz-band images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey while the\nline-of-sight stellar velocity distribution and line-strength Lick indices\ninside the effective radius are measured along several position angles. The\nage, metallicity, and alpha-element abundance of the galaxies are estimated\nfrom single stellar-population models. In spite of the available morphological\nclassification, images show that PGC 1852 is a barred spiral which we do not\nfurther consider for mass modelling. The structural parameters of the two\nearly-type galaxies NGC 7113 and PGC 67207 are obtained from a two-dimensional\nphotometric decomposition and the mass-to-light ratio of all the (luminous and\ndark) mass that follows the light is derived from orbit-based axisymmetric\ndynamical modelling together with the mass density of the dark matter halo. The\ndynamically derived mass that follows the light is about a factor of 2 larger\nthan the stellar mass derived using stellar-population models with Kroupa\ninitial mass function. Both galaxies have a lower content of halo dark matter\nwith respect to early-type galaxies in high-density environments and in\nagreement with the predictions of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation.\n", "  We report on our progress in the development of an atomic magnetometer (AM)\nbased low-frequency magnetic particle imaging (MPI) scanner, expected to be\nfree from Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) and Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS)\nconstraints. We address major challenges in coil and sensor design due to\nspecific AM properties. Compared to our previous work we have changed the AM's\nmode of operation towards its implementation for detecting weak magnetic\nnanoparticles (MNP) response fields in the presence of nearby-located strong\ndrive/selection fields. We demonstrate that a pump-probe AM scheme in a buffer\ngas filled alkali vapour cell can tolerate mT/m gradients while maintaining a\nsensitivity in the one-digit pT/Hz^(1/2) range over a bandwidth from DC to\nseveral kHz. We give a detailed description of the drive/selection coils'\ngeometry and their hardware implementations that provides a field-free-line\n(FFL) operation, compatible with a best performance AM operation. We estimate\nthe achievable field of view and spatial resolution of the scanner as well as\nits sensitivity, assuming mechanical scanning of a Resovist sample through the\nfield-free point/line.\n", "  The electronic Schr\\\"odinger equation describes the motion of N electrons\nunder Coulomb interaction forces in a field of clamped nuclei. The solutions of\nthis equation, the electronic wavefunctions, depend on 3N variables, three\nspatial dimensions for each electron. We study the approximability of these\nwavefunctions by linear combinations of anisotropic Gauss functions, or more\nprecisely Gauss-Hermite functions, products of polynomials and anisotropic\nGauss functions in the narrow sense. We show that the original, singular\nwavefunctions can up to given accuracy and a negligibly small residual error be\napproximated with only insignificantly more such terms than their convolution\nwith a Gaussian kernel of sufficiently small width and that basically arbitrary\norders of convergence can be reached. This is a fairly surprising result, since\nit essentially means that by this type of approximation, the intricate\nhierarchies of non-smooth cusps in electronic wavefunctions have almost no\nimpact on the convergence, once the global structure is resolved.\n", "  We analyze characteristic properties of two different cosmological models:\n(i) a one-component dark energy model where the bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ is\nassociated with the fluid as a whole, and (ii) a two-component model where\n$\\zeta$ is associated with a dark matter component $\\rho_{\\rm m}$ only, the\ndark energy component considered inviscid. Shear viscosity is omitted. We\nassume throughout the simple equation of state $p=w\\rho$, with $w$ a constant.\nIn the one-component model we consider two possibilities, either to take\n$\\zeta$ proportional to the scalar expansion (equivalent to the Hubble\nparameter), in which case the evolution becomes critically dependent on the\nvalue of the small constant $\\alpha=1+w$ and the magnitude of $\\zeta$. Second,\nwe consider the case $\\zeta=~$const., where a de Sitter final stage is reached\nin the future. In the two-component model we consider only the case where the\ndark matter viscosity $\\zeta_{\\rm m}$ is proportional to the square of\n$\\rho_{\\rm m}$, where again a de Sitter form is found in the future. In this\nlatter case the formalism is supplemented by a phase space analysis. As a\ngeneral result of our considerations we suggest that a value $\\zeta_0\\sim\n10^6~$Pa s for the present viscosity is reasonable, and that the two-component\nmodel seems to be favored.\n", "  We report here on time-resolved x-ray diffraction measurements following\nfemtosecond laser excitation in pure bulk chromium. Comparing the evolution of\nincommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) and atomic lattice reflections, we\nshow that, few nanoseconds after laser excitation, the CDW undergoes different\nstructural changes than the atomic lattice. We give evidence for a transient\nCDW shear strain that breaks the lattice point symmetry. This strain is\ncharacteristic of sliding CDWs, as observed in other incommensurate CDW\nsystems, suggesting the laser-induced CDW sliding capability in 3D systems.\nThis first evidence opens perspectives for unconventional laser-assisted\ntransport of correlated charges.\n", "  We report the fabrication of few hundred microns long, hundreds of nanometers\nwide and 30 nm thick meanders made from YBa2CU3O7. Thin films protected by a 8\nnm-thick Ce02 cap layer have been patterned by high energy (a few tens of keV)\noxygen ion irradiation through photoresist masks. DC and RF characterizations\noutline good superconducting properties of nano-meanders that could be used as\nSuperconducting Single Photon Detectors (SSPD). By mean of a resonant method,\ntheir inductance, which mainly sets the maximum speed of these devices, has\nbeen measured on a wide range of temperature. It compares favorably with\nexpected values calculated from the geometry of the meanders and the known\nLondon penetration depth in YBa2CU3O7.\n", "  We investigate how correlated fluctuations affect oscillatory features in\nrephasing and non-rephasing two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectra of a model\ndimer system. Based on a beating map analysis, we show that non-secular\nenvironmental couplings induced by uncorrelated fluctuations lead to\noscillations centered at both cross- and diagonal-peaks in rephasing spectra as\nwell as in non-rephasing spectra. Using an analytical approach, we provide a\nquantitative description of the non-secular effects in terms of the Feynman\ndiagrams and show that the environment-induced mixing of different\ninter-excitonic coherences leads to oscillations in the rephasing\ndiagonal-peaks and non-rephasing cross-peaks. We demonstrate that as\ncorrelations in the noise increase, the lifetime of oscillatory 2D signals is\nenhanced at rephasing cross-peaks and non-rephasing diagonal-peaks, while the\nother non-secular oscillatory signals are suppressed. We discuss that the\nasymmetry of 2D lineshapes in the beating map provides information on the\ndegree of correlations in environmental fluctuations. Finally we investigate\nhow the oscillatory features in 2D spectra are affected by inhomogeneous\nbroadening.\n", "  The resonant state expansion (RSE), a rigorous perturbative method in\nelectrodynamics, is formulated for Transverse Electrodynamic modes of an\neffectively $2$-dimensional system. The RSE is a perturbation theory based on\nthe Lippmann Schwinger Green's function equation and requires knowledge of the\nGreen's function of the unperturbed system constructed from Resonant-states. I\nuse the analytic Green's function for the magnetic field to normalize the modes\nappearing in the corresponding spectral Green's function. This use of the\nresidue and cut of the analytic Green's function is a solution to the failure\nof the flux volume integral method of normalization for continuum states, a\nproblem which is discussed in detail in this manuscript. In brief, the flux\nvolume integral fails for continuum states because they are not true resonance.\nAn analytic relation between normalized magnetic and electric modes is\ndeveloped as part of the solution to these difficulties.The complex\neigenfrequencies of modes are calculated using the RSE for the case of a\nhomogeneous perturbation.\n", "  Constructive resonances with minimum entropy are derived from measurements of\nphotoelectric effect cross sections at atomic K-shell thresholds. A resonance\nregion with optimal constructive interference is given by a principal wave\nlength {\\lambda} of the order of Bohr atom radius. Our study shows that the\nproton shape is not a sphere but it has an elliptical volumetric shape with two\nequal axes and the other different. Resonance waves allowed us the possibility\nto measure both proton radius and shape through an interference term. This\nlast, was a necessary condition in order to have an effective cross section\nmaximum at threshold. The minimum entropy means minimum shape deformation and\nit was found to be (0.830 +/- 0.015) fm and the average proton radius was found\nto be (0.851 +/- 0.201) fm.\n", "  The dual superconductivity is a promising mechanism for quark confinement. We\nhave presented a new formulation of the Yang-Mills theory on the lattice that\nenables us to change the original non-Abelian gauge field into the new field\nvariables such that one of them called the restricted field gives the dominant\ncontribution to quark confinement in the gauge independent way. We have pointed\nout that the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory has another reformulation using new field\nvariables (minimal option), in addition to the way adopted by Cho, Faddeev and\nNiemi (maximal option). In the past lattice conferences, we have shown the\nnumerical evidences that support the non-Abelian dual superconductivity using\nthe minimal option for the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. This result should be\ncompared with Abelian dual superconductivity obtained in the maximal option\nwhich is a gauge invariant extension of the conventional Abelian projection\nmethod in the maximal Abelian gauge.\n  In this talk, we focus on discriminating between two reformulations, i.e.,\nmaximal and minimal options of the $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory from the viewpoint\nof dual superconductivity for quark confinement. We investigate the\nconfinement/deconfinement phase transitions at finite temperature in both\noptions, which are compared with the original Yang-Mills theory. For this\npurpose, we measure the distribution of Polyakov-loops and the Polyakov-loop\naverage, the correlation function of the Polyakov loops and the distribution of\nthe chromoelectric flux connecting a quark and antiquark in both confinement\nand deconfinement phases.\n", "  The formation of satellites is thought to be a natural by-product of planet\nformation in our Solar System, and thus, moons of extrasolar planets (exomoons)\nmay be abundant in extrasolar planetary systems, as well. Exomoons have yet to\nbe discovered. However, moons larger than 0.1 Earth masses can be detected and\ncharacterized using current transit techniques. Here, we show that collisions\nbetween rocky planets with masses between a quarter to ten Earth masses can\ncreate impact-generated debris disks that could accrete into moons. Collisions\nbetween like-sized objects, at oblique impact angles, and velocities near\nescape speed create disks massive enough to form satellites that are\ndynamically stable against planetary tides. Impacts of this type onto a\nsuperearth between 2 to 7 Earth masses can launch into orbit enough mass to\ncreate a satellite large enough to be detected in Kepler transit data. Impact\nvelocity is a crucial controlling factor on disk mass, which has been\noverlooked in all prior studies of moon formation via planetary collision.\n", "  In this paper we analytically investigate the ground-state properties of a\ntwo-dimensional polarized degenerate Fermi gas in a high-finesse optical\ncavity, which is governed by a generalized Fermi-Dicke model with tunable\nparameters. By solving the photon-number dependent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes\nequation, we find rich quantum phases and phase diagrams, which depend\ncrucially on the fermion-photon coupling strength, the fermion-fermion\ninteraction strength, and the atomic resonant frequency (effective Zeeman\nfield). In particular, without the fermion-fermion interaction and with a weak\natomic resonant frequency, we find a mixed phase that the normal phase with two\nFermi surfaces and the superradiant phase coexist, and reveal a first-order\nphase transition from this normal phase to the superradiant phase. With the\nintermediate fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-photon coupling strengths,\nwe predict another mixed phase that the superfluid and superradiant phases\ncoexist. Finally, we address briefly how to detect these predicted quantum\nphases and phase diagrams in experiments.\n", "  Chemical reactions can be surprisingly efficient at ultracold temperatures (\n< 1mK) due to the wave nature of atoms and molecules. The study of reactions in\nthe ultracold regime is a new research frontier enabled by cooling and trapping\ntechniques developed in atomic and molecular physics. In addition, ultracold\nmolecular gases that offer diverse molecular internal states and large electric\ndipolar interactions are sought after for studies of strongly interacting\nmany-body quantum physics. Here we propose a new approach for producing\nultracold molecules in the absolute internal and motional quantum ground state,\nwhere single molecules are assembled one by one from individual atoms. The\nscheme involves laser cooling, optical trapping, Raman sideband cooling, and\ncoherent molecular state transfer. As a crucial initial step, we demonstrate\nquantum control of constituent atoms, including 3D ground-state cooling of a\nsingle Cs atom, in a simple apparatus. As laser technology advances to shorter\nwavelengths, additional atoms will be amenable to laser-cooling, allowing more\ndiverse, and eventually more complex, molecules to be assembled with full\nquantum control.\n", "  Hecht equation is not adequate to analyzing standard measurements, of the\nmobility-lifetime product, carried out with single pixels of detector arrays. A\nmodified expression is calculated, in order to have correct mobility-lifetime\nvalues out of experimental data.\n", "  The ladder operators for one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator were\nconstructed by Schr\\\"odinger in 1940s. We extend this method to a two\ndimensional uniform magnetic field and establish the ladder operators which\ndepend on all spatial variables of quantum system. The Hamiltonian of quantum\nsystem can also be written by the velocity of the particle.\n", "  This is the second paper of a series aimed to study the stellar kinematics\nand population properties of bulges in highly-inclined barred galaxies. In this\nwork, we carry out a detailed analysis of the stellar age, metallicity and\n[Mg/Fe] of 28 highly-inclined ($i > 65^{o}$) disc galaxies, from S0 to S(B)c,\nobserved with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. The sample is divided\ninto two clean samples of barred and unbarred galaxies, on the basis of the\ncorrelation between the stellar velocity and h$_3$ profiles, as well as the\nlevel of cylindrical rotation within the bulge region. We find that while the\nmean stellar age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] in the bulges of barred and unbarred\ngalaxies are not statistically distinct, the [Mg/Fe] gradients along the minor\naxis (away from the disc) of barred galaxies are significantly different than\nthose without bars. For barred galaxies, stars that are vertically further away\nfrom the midplane are in general more [Mg/Fe]--enhanced and thus the vertical\ngradients in [Mg/Fe] for barred galaxies are mostly positive, while for\nunbarred bulges the [Mg/Fe] profiles are typically negative or flat. This\nresult, together with the old populations observed in the barred sample,\nindicates that bars are long-lasting structures, and therefore are not easily\ndestroyed. The marked [Mg/Fe] differences with the bulges of unbarred galaxies\nindicate that different formation/evolution scenarios are required to explain\ntheir build-up, and emphasizes the role of bars in redistributing stellar\nmaterial in the bulge dominated regions.\n", "  We analyzed available observational data of a sample of dark matter (DM)\ndominated galaxies and clusters of galaxies and we have found correlations\nbetween the virial mass, $M_{vir}$, of halos and basic parameters of their\ncores, namely, the mean DM density, pressure and entropy. These correlations\nare a natural consequence of similar evolution of all such objects. It is\ndriven mainly by gravitational interactions what implies a high degree of self\nsimilarity of both the process of halos formation and their internal structure.\n  We confirmed the CDM--like shape of both the small and large scale power\nspectrum. However, our reconstruction of the evolutionary history of observed\nobjects requires either a multicomponent composition of DM or a more complex\nprimordial power spectrum of density perturbations with significant excess of\npower at scales of clusters of galaxies and larger. We demonstrated that a\nmodel with suitable combination of the heavy DM particles (CDM) and DM\nparticles with large damping scale (HDM) could provide a successful description\nof the observational data in a wide range of masses.\n", "  The Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is a region containing massive and\ndense molecular clouds, with dynamics driven by a variety of energy sources\nincluding a massive black hole. It is thus the nearest template for\nunderstanding physical processes in extragalactic nuclei. The CMZ's neutral\ninterstellar gas has been mapped spectrally in many neutral atomic and\nmolecular gas tracers, but the ionized and CO-dark H2 regions are less well\ntraced spectroscopically. We mapped the fine structure line of C+ at 158\nmicrons, [C II], to identify and characterize features of the ionized gas in\nthe CMZ, including UV irradiated neutral gas, photon dominated regions (PDRs),\nCO-dark H2 gas, and highly ionized gas. We observed the [C II] 158-micron fine\nstructure line with high spectral resolution using Herschel HIFI with two\nperpendicular On-the-Fly strip scans, along l = -0.8 to +0.8 and b = -0.8 to\n+0.8, both centered on (l,b) = (0,0). We analyzed the spatial-velocity\ndistribution of the [C II] data and compared them to those of [C I] and CO, and\nto dust continuum maps, in order to determine the properties and distribution\nof the UV irradiated gas and its dynamics within the CMZ. The longitude- and\nlatitude-velocity maps of [C II] trace portions of the orbiting open gas\nstreams of dense molecular clouds, the cloud G0.253+0.016, also known as the\nBrick, the Arched Filaments, and the ionized gas near Sgr A and Sgr B2. We use\nthe [C II] and auxiliary data to determine the physical and dynamical\nproperties of these CMZ features. The [C II] emission arises primarily from\ndense PDRs and highly ionized gas, and is an important tracer of the kinematics\nand physical conditions of this gas.\n", "  In a recent paper (arXiv:1612.00266), we reported the results of the first\nsearch for echoes from Planck-scale modifications of general relativity near\nblack hole event horizons using the public data release by the Advanced LIGO\ngravitational wave observatory. While we found tentative evidence (at $\\simeq 3\n\\sigma$ level) for the presence of these echoes, our statistical methodology\nwas challenged by Ashton, et al. (arXiv:1612.05625), just in time for the\nholidays! In this short note, we briefly address these criticisms, arguing that\nthey either do not affect our conclusion or change its significance by\n$\\lesssim 0.3\\sigma$. The real test will be whether our finding can be\nreproduced by independent groups using independent methodologies (and\nultimately more data).\n", "  The recent fast growth of a population of millisecond pulsars with precisely\nmeasured mass provides an excellent opportunity to characterize these compact\nstars at an unprecedented level. This is because the stellar parameter values\ncan be accurately computed for known mass and spin rate and an assumed equation\nof state (EoS) model. For each of the 16 such pulsars and for a set of EoS\nmodels from nucleonic, hyperonic, strange quark matter and hybrid classes, we\nnumerically compute fast spinning stable stellar parameter values considering\nthe full effect of general relativity. This first detailed catalogue of the\ncomputed parameter values of observed millisecond pulsars provides a testbed to\nprobe the physics of compact stars, including their formation, evolution and\nEoS. We estimate uncertainties on these computed values from the uncertainty of\nthe measured mass, which could be useful to quantitatively constrain EoS\nmodels. We note that the largest value of the central density $\\rho_{\\rm c}$ in\nour catalogue is $\\sim 5.8$ times the nuclear saturation density $\\rho_{\\rm\nsat}$, which is much less than the expected maximum value $13 \\rho_{\\rm sat}$.\nWe argue that the $\\rho_{\\rm c}$-values of at most a small fraction of compact\nstars could be much larger than $5.8 \\rho_{\\rm sat}$. Besides, we find that the\nconstraints on EoS models from accurate radius measurements could be\nsignificantly biased for some of our pulsars, if stellar $spinning$\nconfigurations are not used to compute the theoretical radius values.\n", "  We investigate numerically several proxy measures for the number of states\ncontained within the holographic entropy cone, compared to the number contained\nwithin the quantum entropy cone, for states with $3$ and $4$ parties. We find\nan interesting tension: while measures focused on calculating the volume ratios\nbetween the two cones indicate that the quantum cone is much larger than the\nholographic one, measures based on the generation of random states and then\ncalculating the entropies thereof imply that almost all such randomly generated\nstates are also contained within the holographic entropy cone. Also\ninterestingly, the volume measures strongly indicate a difference in the number\nof states within the quantum or stabiliser cones versus the number in the\nholographic cone, which is not reproduced by the other classes of measures. We\ncomment on the difference between the two classes of measures, and why each may\nbe preferable.\n", "  We present a photometric study of PGC 1000714, a galaxy resembling Hoag's\nObject with a complete detached outer ring, that has not yet been described in\nthe literature. Since the Hoag-type galaxies are extremely rare and peculiar\nsystems, it is necessary to increase the sample of known objects by performing\nthe detailed studies on the possible candidates to derive conclusions about\ntheir nature, evolution, and systematic properties. We therefore performed\nsurface photometry of the central body by using the archival near-UV, infrared\ndata and the new optical data (BVRI). This current work has revealed for the\nfirst time an elliptical galaxy with two fairly round rings. The central body\nfollows well a r^(1/4) light profile, with no sign of a bar or stellar disc. By\nreconstructing the observed spectral energy distribution, we recover the\nstellar population properties of the central body and the outer ring. Our work\nsuggests different formation histories for the galaxy components. Possible\norigins of the galaxy are discussed, and we conclude that a recent accretion\nevent is the most plausible scenario that accounts for the observational\ncharacteristic of PGC 1000714.\n", "  Liquid metallic hydrogen (LMH) was recently produced under static compression\nand high temperatures in bench-top experiments. Here, we report a study of the\noptical reflectance of LMH in the pressure region of 1.4-1.7 Mbar and use the\nDrude free-electron model to determine its optical conductivity. We find static\nelectrical conductivity of metallic hydrogen to be 11,000-15,000 S/cm. A\nsubstantial dissociation fraction is required to best fit the energy dependence\nof the observed reflectance. LMH at our experimental conditions is largely\natomic and degenerate, not primarily molecular. We determine a plasma frequency\nand the optical conductivity. Properties are used to analyze planetary\nstructure of hydrogen rich planets such as Jupiter.\n", "  The NASA TESS mission will deliver hundreds of transiting exoplanet\ncandidates orbiting bright stars. The spectrometers SOPHIE at OHP and SPIRou at\nCFHT will be ideal to obtain radial velocities of these candidates, confirm\ntheir nature, and derive the planets' masses. These measurements will be\ncrucial to deliver the best targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST.\nHere, we calculate the required observing time with SOPHIE, SPIRou, and JWST\nfor each of the TESS targets in order to prepare follow-up observations. To\ninfer their potential for JWST, we restrict the calculations to the case of\ntransmission spectroscopy with NIRISS. The radial velocity follow-up of the\ngiant planets ($R_p > 4 \\rm \\, R_E$) could be achieved with SOPHIE, with a\nmedian observing time of 3.47 hours per target, and a total observing time of\n305 hours that includes the 80% most favorable cases. Several small planets\n($R_p < 4 \\rm \\, R_E$) could also be confirmed, but most of them would require\nan unrealistic time investment. On the other hand, SPIRou is ideally suited to\nthe follow-up of the small planets, with a median observing time of 2.65 hours\nper target, and a median observing time of 4.70 hours for the terrestrial\nplanets in the habitable zone ($R_p < 2 \\rm \\, R_E$, $S < 2 \\rm \\, S_E$). With\nJWST, the 10% most favorable small planets (184 planets) have a median\nobserving time of 16.2 hours, and the 10% most favorable habitable zone\nterrestrial planets (7 planets) have a median observing time of 59.7 hours.\nOverall, this study will help define a follow-up strategy and prepare\nobservation programs with SOPHIE and SPIRou before the first planet candidates\nare delivered by TESS.\n", "  Class I methanol masers are found to be good tracers of the interaction\nbetween outflows from massive young stellar objects with their surrounding\nmedia. Although polarization observations of Class II methanol masers have been\nable to provide information about magnetic fields close to the central\n(proto)stars, polarization observations of Class I methanol masers are rare,\nespecially at 44 and 95 GHz. We present the results of linear polarization\nobservations of 39 Class I methanol maser sources at 44 and 95 GHz. These two\nlines are observed simultaneously with one of the 21 m Korean VLBI Network\ntelescopes in single-dish mode. Approximately 60% of the observed sources have\nfractional polarizations of a few percent in at least one transition. This is\nthe first reported detection of linear polarization of the 44 GHz methanol\nmaser. The two maser transitions show similar polarization properties,\nindicating that they trace similar magnetic environments, although the fraction\nof the linear polarization is slightly higher at 95 GHz. We discuss the\nassociation between the directions of polarization angles and outflows. We also\ndiscuss some targets having different polarization properties at both lines,\nincluding DR21(OH) and G82.58+0.20, which show the 90{\\deg} polarization angle\nflip at 44 GHz.\n", "  We propose a derivative operator formed as a function of derivatives of the\nelectron coordinates. When the derivative operator is applied to the Laughlin\nwave function, two new wave functions in the lowest Landau level at filling\nfactor 1/2 are generated. For systems of 4, 6, and 8 electrons in spherical\ngeometry, it is shown that the first wave function has nearly unity overlap\nwith the particle-hole conjugate of the Moore-Read Pfaffian wave function,\ntherefore together with the Moore-Read Pfaffian state forms a particle-hole\nconjugate pair. The second wave function has essentially perfect particle-hole\nsymmetry itself, with a positive parity when the number of electron pairs N/2\nis an even integer and and a negative parity when N/2 is an odd integer. An\nequivalent form suggests the first wave function forms a f-wave pairing of\ncomposite fermions, and the second wave function forms a p-wave pairing. The\ncorresponding Non-Abelian statistics quasiparticle wave functions are also\nproposed.\n", "  A characteristic feature of topological systems is the presence of robust\ngapless edge states. In this work the effect of time-dependent perturbations on\nthe edge states is considered. Specifically we consider perturbations that can\nbe understood as changes of the parameters of the Hamiltonian. These changes\nmay be sudden or carried out at a fixed rate. In general, the edge modes decay\nin the thermodynamic limit, but for finite systems a revival time is found that\nscales with the system size. The dynamics of fermionic edge modes and Majorana\nmodes are compared. The effect of periodic perturbations is also referred\nallowing the appearance of edge modes out of a topologically trivial phase.\n", "  The preferentially (220) orientated polycrystalline silicon films have been\nfabricated by performing photon-involved rapid thermal annealing upon amorphous\nsilicon films. In contrast, conventional thermal annealing of the silicon\namorphous films results in the preference of (111) orientated crystallization.\nThis difference reveals the overlooked impaction of photons upon silicon atoms,\nwhich results in the preferential orientation of lattice plans with the\nsmallest density of atoms on their projection plane rather than the lowest\nenergies.\n", "  A review is given of our present knowledge of different parametrization of\nexperimental results in inelastic scattering process with polarized proton\nbeams. Spin observables in inelastic proton scattering for a set of lightweight\nnuclei are studied at intermediate energies in the region of 100-500 MeV. Two\nimportant types of DWIA calculations are used in the analysis of experiments.\nImportant spin observables representing the difference functions (P-Ay) and\n(P-Ay)sigma are examined along with the polarization-transfer (spin-transfer)\ncoefficients D(ij), i.e. D with indices NN, SS, LL, LS and SL, in inelastic\nscattering of polarized protons. The above indicated value of sigma is the\ndifferential cross section. These spin observables are treated in the context\nof the exchange features of the effective interaction. The linear combinations\nD(K), D(i) of the complete polarization-transfer observables D(ij) in inelastic\nproton scattering at intermediate energies are extensively demonstrated. A\ncomparison between systematized, measured and calculated quantities of the\ncombinations D(K) and, partially, sigma D(K) for the 1+ (T=0 and T=1) levels in\n12-C, for the 4- (T=0 and T=1) states in 16-O, and for the 6- (T=0 and T=1)\nlevels in 28-Si are reported. Particularities in angular distributions of\ntransverse- and longitudinal-spin-transfer probabilities D(K) for T=0 and T=1\nunnatural-parity states in some nuclei are discussed. The spin-observable\ncombinations D(Ls) allowed to differentiate reliably the strength of isoscalar\nand isovector spin-orbit. interactions. The comparison of the experimental and\ncalculated D(K) for the 1+, T = 0 state in 12- C with the use of zero-range\ntreatment (LEA code) and exact finite-range calculations (DWBA-91 program) made\nit possible to identify the role of exchange contributions. Other observables\nare also considered for the same purposes.\n", "  We study discrete symmetries satisfied by helical $p$-wave superconductors\nwith d-vectors $k_{x}\\hat{x}\\pm k_{y}\\hat{y}$ or $k_{y}\\hat{x}\\pm k_{x}\\hat{y}$\nand transformations brought by the symmetry operations to ferromagnet and\nspin-singlet superconductors, which show intimate associations with transport\nproperties in heterojunctions including helical superconductor. Especially, the\npartial symmetries of the Hamiltonian under the spin-rotation and\ngauge-rotation operations are responsible for novel invariances of the\nconductance in tunnel junctions and new selection rules of the lowest current\nand peculiar phase diagrams in Josephson junctions which are reported recently.\nThe symmetries of constructed free energies for Josephson junctions are also\nanalyzed which are consistent with the results from Hamiltonian.\n", "  Quantum correlations in multiple quantum (MQ) NMR experiments are\ninvestigated in two-spin systems (dimers). In the initial moment of time one\nspin is in a pure quantum polarized state and the other spin is in the\nthermodynamic equilibrium state defined by the temperature of the sample. MQ\nNMR dynamics of dimers is investigated. It is shown that MQ NMR coherences of\nonly the zeroth and second orders emerge in such a system. The intensities of\nthose coherences are calculated. Entangled states appear in the course of the\nsystem evolution in the MQ NMR experiment. The quantum discord is obtained in\nthe high temperature approximation.\n", "  Multiple quantum (MQ) NMR methods \\cite{Baum} are applied to the analysis of\nvarious problems of quantum information processing.\n  It is shown that the two-spin/two-quantum Hamiltonian \\cite{Baum} describing\nMQ NMR dynamics is related to the flip-flop Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional\nspin system in the approximation of the nearest neighbor interactions.\n  As a result, it is possible to organize quantum state transfer along a linear\nchain.\n  MQ NMR experiments are performed on quasi-one-dimensional chains of\n\\BPChem{\\^{19}F} nuclei in calcium fluorapatite \\BPChem{Ca\\_5(PO\\_4)\\_3F}.\nRelaxation of the MQ NMR coherences is considered as the simplest model of\ndecoherence processes. A theory of the dipolar relaxation of the MQ NMR\ncoherences in one-dimensional systems is developed. A good agreement of the\ntheoretical predictions and the experimental data is obtained.\n", "  In this paper we review the recent progress in the (indefinite) string\ndensity problem and its applications to the Camassa--Holm equation.\n", "  Closure quantities measured by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)\nobservations are independent of instrumental and propagation instabilities and\nantenna gain factors, but are sensitive to source structure. A new method is\nproposed to calculate a structure index based on the median values of closure\nquantities rather than the brightness distribution of a source. The results are\ncomparable to structure indices based on imaging observations at other epochs\nand demonstrate the flexibility of deriving structure indices from exactly the\nsame observations as used for geodetic analysis and without imaging analysis. A\nthree-component model for the structure of source 3C371 is developed by\nmodel-fitting closure phases. It provides a real case of tracing how the\nstructure effect identified by closure phases in the same observations as the\ndelay observables affects the geodetic analysis, and investigating which\ngeodetic parameters are corrupted to what extent by the structure effect. Using\nthe resulting structure correction based on the three-component model of source\n3C371, two solutions, with and without correcting the structure effect, are\nmade. With corrections, the overall rms of this source is reduced by 1 ps, and\nthe impacts of the structure effect introduced by this single source are up to\n1.4 mm on station positions and up to 4.4 microarcseconds on Earth orientation\nparameters. This study is considered as a starting point for handling the\nsource structure effect on geodetic VLBI from geodetic sessions themselves.\n", "  Although the existence of quasi-bound rotational levels of the $X^+ \\\n^2\\Sigma_g^+$ ground state of H$_2^+$ has been predicted a long time ago, these\nstates have never been observed. Calculated positions and widths of quasi-bound\nrotational levels located close to the top of the centrifugal barriers have not\nbeen reported either. Given the role that such states play in the recombination\nof H(1s) and H$^+$ to form H$_2^+$, this lack of data may be regarded as one of\nthe largest unknown aspects of this otherwise accurately known fundamental\nmolecular cation. We present measurements of the positions and widths of the\nlowest-lying quasi-bound rotational levels of H$_2^+$ and compare the\nexperimental results with the positions and widths we calculate using a\npotential model for the $X^+$ state of H$_2^+$ which includes adiabatic,\nnonadiabatic, relativistic and radiative corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate how the drainage and rupture of\nsurfactant-stabilised bubbles floating at the surface of a liquid pool depend\non the concentration of surface-active molecules in water. Drainage\nmeasurements at the apex of bubbles indicate that the flow profile is\nincreasingly plug-like as the surfactant concentration is decreased from\nseveral times the critical micellar concentration (cmc) to just below the cmc.\nHigh-speed observations of bubble bursting reveal that the position at which a\nhole nucleates in the bubble cap also depends on the surfactant concentration.\nOn average, the rupture is initiated close to the bubble foot for low\nconcentrations (< cmc) while its locus moves towards the top of the bubble cap\nas the concentration increases above the cmc. In order to explain this\ntransition, we propose that marginal regeneration may be responsible for bubble\nrupture at low concentrations but that bursting at the apex for higher\nconcentrations is driven by gravitational drainage.\n", "  In this paper, we study how the pro-social impact due to the vigilance by\nother individuals is conditioned by both environmental and evolutionary\neffects. To this aim, we consider a known model where agents play a Prisoner's\nDilemma Game (PDG) among themselves and the pay-off matrix of an individual\nchanges according to the number of neighbors that are \"vigilant\", i.e., how\nmany neighbors watch out for her behavior. In particular, the temptation to\ndefect decreases linearly with the number of vigilant neighbors. This model\nproved to support cooperation in specific conditions, and here we check its\nrobustness with different topologies, microscopical update rules and initial\nconditions. By means of many numerical simulations and few theoretical\nconsiderations, we find in which situations the vigilance by the others is more\neffective in favoring cooperative behaviors and when its influence is weaker.\n", "  The energy of one hole in one dimensional Ising antiferromagnet is calculated\nusing exact diagonalization (ED) method on finite systems with number of sites\nN ranging from 4 to 50. This study gives a power-law description for the hole\nenergy in the weak coupling region (0.001 less than or equal to Jz/t and Jz/t\nless than or equal to 0.1).This power-law description can otherwise be\nunderstood as a weak string-like energy that tends to compromise the motion of\nthe hole by confining it to its birth site. However, for large N, the hole is\nfound to escape from this confinement and hence propagates as a free particle\nin agreement with theoretical results in the bulk limit and experimental\nobservations from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) of\nspin-charge separation. In the strong coupling regime (Jz/t greater than 1),\nthe energy of the hole is found to be independent of the system size.\nAccordingly, the velocities corresponding to charge and spin degrees of freedom\nin this regime become comparable. Under this situation, the hole may be treated\nas a localized particle.\n", "  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) represent a class of\ninstruments which are dedicated to the ground-based observation of cosmic VHE\ngamma ray emission based on the detection of the Cherenkov radiation produced\nin the interaction of gamma rays with the Earth atmosphere. One of the key\nelements of such instruments is a pixelized focal-plane camera consisting of\nphotodetectors. To date, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have been the common\nchoice given their high photon detection efficiency (PDE) and fast time\nresponse. Recently, silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are emerging as an\nalternative. This rapidly evolving technology has strong potential to become\nsuperior to that based on PMTs in terms of PDE, which would further improve the\nsensitivity of IACTs, and see a price reduction per square millimeter of\ndetector area. We are working to develop a SiPM-based module for the\nfocal-plane cameras of the MAGIC telescopes to probe this technology for IACTs\nwith large focal plane cameras of an area of few square meters. We will\ndescribe the solutions we are exploring in order to balance a competitive\nperformance with a minimal impact on the overall MAGIC camera design using ray\ntracing simulations. We further present a comparative study of the overall\nlight throughput based on Monte Carlo simulations and considering the\nproperties of the major hardware elements of an IACT.\n", "  To synthesize diffusion MR measurements from Monte-Carlo simulation using\ntissue models with sizes comparable to those of scan voxels. Larger regions\nenable restricting structures to be modeled in greater detail and improve\naccuracy and precision in synthesized diffusion-weighted measurements.\n  We employ a localized intersection checking algorithm during substrate\nconstruction and dynamical simulation. Although common during dynamics\nsimulation, a dynamically constructed intersection map is also applied here\nduring substrate construction, facilitating construction of much larger\nsubstrates than would be possible with a naive \"brute-force\" approach. We\ninvestigate the approach's performance using a packed cylinder model of white\nmatter, investigating optimal execution time for simulations, convergence of\nsynthesized signals and variance in diffusion-weighted measurements over a wide\nrange of acquisition parameters. The scheme is demonstrated with cylinder-based\nsubstrates but is also readily applicable to other geometric primitives, such\nas spheres or triangles.\n  The algorithm enables models with far larger substrates to be run with no\nadditional computational cost. The improved sampling reduces bias and variance\nin synthetic measurements.\n  The new method improves accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of synthetic\nmeasurements in Monte-Carlo simulation-based data synthesis. The larger\nsubstrates it makes possible are better able to capture the complexity of the\ntissue we are modeling, leading to reduced bias and variance in synthesised\ndata, compared to existing implementation of MC simulations.\n", "  Recently, high-resolution spectroscopy of slow beams of metastable helium\nmolecules (He$_2^*$) generated by multistage Zeeman deceleration was used in\ncombination with Rydberg-series extrapolation techniques to obtain the lowest\nrotational interval in the molecular helium ion at a precision of 18 MHz\n[Jansen et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 115 (13) (2015) 133202], limited by the\ntemporal width of the Fourier-transform-limited laser pulses used to record the\nspectra. We present here an extension of these measurements in which we have\n(1) measured higher rotational intervals of He${_2}^+$, (2) replaced the pulsed\nUV laser by a cw UV laser and improved the resolution of the spectra by a\nfactor of more than five, and (3) studied $M_J$ redistribution processes in\nregions of low magnetic fields of the Zeeman decelerator and shown how these\nprocesses can be exploited to assign transitions originating from specific\nspin-rotational levels ($N^{\\prime\\prime},J^{\\prime\\prime}$) of He$_2^*$.\n", "  The field-effect-induced modulation of transport properties of 2-dimensional\nelectron gases residing at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and LaGaO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$\ninterfaces has been investigated in a back-gate configuration. Both samples\nwith crystalline and with amorphous overlayers have been considered. We show\nthat the \"na\\\"ive\" standard scenario, in which the back electrode and the\n2-dimensional electron gas are simply modeled as capacitor plates, dramatically\nfails in describing the observed phenomenology. Anomalies appearing after the\nfirst low-temperature application of a positive gate bias, and causing a\nnon-volatile perturbation of sample properties, are observed in all our\nsamples. Such anomalies are shown to drive low-carrier density samples to a\npersistent insulating state. Recovery of the pristine metallic state can be\neither obtained by a long room-temperature field annealing, or,\ninstantaneously, by a relatively modest dose of visible-range photons.\nIllumination causes a sudden collapse of the electron system back to the\nmetallic ground state, with a resistivity drop exceeding four orders of\nmagnitude. The data are discussed and interpreted on the base of the analogy\nwith floating-gate MOSFET devices, which sheds a new light on the effects of\nback-gating on oxide-based 2-dimensional electron gases. A more formal\napproach, allowing for a semi-quantitative estimate of the relevant surface\ncarrier densities for different samples and under different back-gate voltages,\nis proposed in the Appendix.\n", "  Are there examples of \"astrophysical Russian dolls,\" and what could we learn\nfrom their similarities? In this article, we list a few such examples,\nincluding disks, filaments, and clusters. We suggest that forging connections\nacross disciplinary borders enhances our perception of beauty, while\nsimultaneously leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the Universe.\n", "  Silicene and germanene are key materials for the field of valleytronics.\nHowever, interaction with the substrate, which is necessary to support the\nelectronically active medium, becomes a major obstacle. In the present work, we\npropose a substrate (F-doped WS$_2$) that avoids detrimental effects and at the\nsame time induces the required valley polarization, so that no further steps\nare needed for this purpose. The behavior is explained by proximity effects on\nsilicene/germanene, as demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Broken\ninversion symmetry due to the presence of WS$_2$ opens a substantial band gap\nin silicene/germanene. F doping of WS$_2$ results in spin polarization, which,\nin conjunction with proximity-enhanced spin orbit coupling, creates sizable\nspin-valley polarization.\n", "  Various challenges are faced when animalcules such as bacteria, protozoa,\nalgae, or sperms move autonomously in aqueous media at low Reynolds number.\nThese active agents are subject to strong stochastic fluctuations, that compete\nwith the directed motion. So far most studies consider the lowest order moments\nof the displacements only, while more general spatio-temporal information on\nthe stochastic motion is provided in scattering experiments. Here we derive\nanalytically exact expressions for the directly measurable intermediate\nscattering function for a mesoscopic model of a single, anisotropic active\nBrownian particle in three dimensions. The mean-square displacement and the\nnon-Gaussian parameter of the stochastic process are obtained as derivatives of\nthe intermediate scattering function. These display different temporal regimes\ndominated by effective diffusion and directed motion due to the interplay of\ntranslational and rotational diffusion which is rationalized within the theory.\nThe most prominent feature of the intermediate scattering function is an\noscillatory behavior at intermediate wavenumbers reflecting the persistent\nswimming motion, whereas at small length scales bare translational and at large\nlength scales an enhanced effective diffusion emerges. We anticipate that our\ncharacterization of the motion of active agents will serve as a reference for\nmore realistic models and experimental observations.\n", "  This paper presents smoothed combined field integral equations for the\nsolution of Dirichlet and Neumann exterior Helmholtz problems. The integral\nequations introduced in this paper are smooth in the sense that they only\ninvolve continuously differentiable integrands in both Dirichlet and Neumann\ncases. These integral equations coincide with the well-known combined field\nequations and are therefore uniquely solvable for all frequencies. In\nparticular, a novel regularization of the hypersingular operator is obtained,\nwhich, unlike regularizations based on Maue's integration-by-parts formula,\ndoes not give rise to involved Cauchy principal value integrals. The smoothed\nintegral operators and layer potentials, on the other hand, can be numerically\nevaluated at target points that are arbitrarily close to the boundary without\nseverely compromising their accuracy. A variety of numerical examples in two\nspatial dimensions that consider three different Nystr\\\"om discretizations for\nsmooth domains and domains with corners---one of which is based on direct\napplication of the trapezoidal rule---demonstrates the effectiveness of the\nproposed integral approach. In certain aspects, this work extends to the\nuniquely solvable Dirichlet and Neumann combined field integral equations, the\nideas presented in the recent contribution R. Soc. Open Sci. 2(140520), 2015.\n", "  We consider two-component Bose-Einstein condensates subject to Weyl\nspin-orbit coupling. We obtain mean-field ground state phase diagram by\nvariational method. In the regime where interspecies coupling is larger than\nintraspecies coupling, the system is found to be fully polarized and condensed\nat a finite momentum lying along the quantization axis. We characterize this\nphase by studying the excitation spectrum, the sound velocity, the quantum\ndepletion of condensates, the shift of ground state energy, and the static\nstructure factor. We find that spin-orbit coupling and interspecies coupling\ngenerally leads to competing effects.\n", "  The exact mechanism responsible for the tenfold enhancement of\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) in a monolayer iron selenide (FeSe)\non SrTiO3(STO) substrate over that of bulk FeSe, is an open issue. We present\nhere a coordinated study of electrical transport and low temperature electron\nenergy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements on FeSe/STO films of various\nthicknesses. Our EELS mapping across the FeSe/STO interface shows direct\nevidence of band-bending caused by electrons transferred from STO to FeSe\nlayer. The transferred electrons were found to accumulate only within the first\ntwo atomic layers of FeSe films near the STO substrate. Our transport results\nfound a positive backgate applied from STO is particularly effective in\nenhancing Tc of the films while minimally changing the carrier density. We\nsuggest that the positive backgate tends to 'pull' the transferred electrons in\nFeSe films closer to the interface and thus further enhances both their\ncoupling to interfacial phonons and the electron-electron interaction within\nFeSe films, thus leading to a huge enhancement of Tc in FeSe films.\n", "  We report charge transport measurements in nanoscale vertical pillar\nstructures incorporating ultrathin layers of the organic semiconductor\npoly(3-hexylthiophene)(P3HT). P3HT layers with thickness down to 5 nm are\ngently top-contacted using wedging transfer, yielding highly reproducible,\nrobust nanoscale junctions carrying high current densities (up to $10^6$\nA/m$^2$). Current-voltage data modeling demonstrates excellent hole injection.\nThis work opens up the pathway towards nanoscale, ultrashort-channel organic\ntransistors for high-frequency and high-current-density operation.\n", "  The collision of ultra-relativistic electron beams with intense short laser\npulses makes possible to study QED in the high-intensity regime. Present day\nhigh-intensity lasers mostly operate with short pulse durations of several tens\nof femtoseconds, i.e. only a few optical cycles. A profound theoretical\nunderstanding of short pulse effects is important not only for studying\nfundamental aspects of high-intensity laser matter interaction, but also for\napplications as novel X- and gamma-ray radiation sources. In this article we\ngive a brief overview of the theory of high-intensity QED with focus on effects\ndue to the short pulse duration. The non-linear spectral broadening in\nnon-linear Compton scattering due to the short pulse duration and its\ncompensation is discussed.\n", "  In this paper I show that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm Gedankenexperiment\nand so-called entanglement of photons have a simple explanation within the\nframework of classical electrodynamics if we take into account the discrete\n(atomic) structure of the detectors and a specific nature of the light-atom\ninteraction. In this case we do not find such a paradox as \"spooky action at a\ndistance\". I show that CHSH criterion in EPRB Gedankenexperiment with classical\nlight waves can exceed not only a maximum value S_HV=2 which is predicted by\nthe local hidden-variable theories but also the maximum value S_QM=2.828\npredicted by quantum mechanics and in this case there is no desire to construct\na local hidden-variable theory.\n", "  We consider two methods of fitting parameters to datasets with sys- tematic\nerrors. Such a procedure is needed to combine results from different\nexperiments where the elements within each dataset share a common systematic\nuncertainty. We show the methods are equivalent.\n", "  The results of observation of short-term variations of high-energy electron\nflux in the outer radiation belt, obtained in ARINA satellite experiment (2006\n- 2016), are presented. Scintillation spectrometer ARINA on board the\nResurs-DK1 Russian satellite has been developed in MEPhI. The instrument\ncarried out continuous measurements of high-energy electron flux and its energy\nspectrum in low-Earth orbits in the range 3-30 MeV with 10 15% energy\nresolution. A time profile of electron flux at different L - shells has been\nstudied in detail on the example of March 2012, and analysis of experimental\ndata on high-energy (4-6 MeV) electrons in the outer radiation belt zone\n(L~3-7) was fulfilled. It was shown a large variability of flux of such\nelectrons there. The sharp effects in electron flux (as rise and as fall) in\nmagnetosphere interrelated with geomagnetic storms caused by solar flares and\ncoronal mass ejections have been observed.\n", "  Using the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory,\nwe systematically investigate the strain-engineering (tensile and compressive\nstrain) electronic, mechanical and transport properties of monolayer\npenta-SiC$_2$. By applying an in-plane tensile or compressive strain, it is\neasy to modulate the electronic band structure of monolayer penta-SiC$_2$,\nwhich subsequently changes the effective mass of carriers. Furthermore, the\nobtained electronic properties are predicted to change from indirectly\nsemiconducting to metallic. More interestingly, at room temperature, uniaxial\nstrain can enhance the hole mobility of penta-SiC$_2$ along a particular\ndirection by almost three order in magnitude, $i.e.$ from 2.59 $\\times10^3\ncm^2/V s$ to 1.14 $\\times10^6 cm^2/V s$ (larger than the carrier mobility of\ngraphene, 3.5 $\\times10^5 cm^2/V s$), with little influence on the electron\nmobility. The high carrier mobility of monolayer penta-SiC$_2$ may lead to many\npotential applications in high-performance electronic and optoelectronic\ndevices\n", "  We study the symmetry reduction of nonlinear partial differential equations\nwhich are used for describing diffusion processes in nonhomogeneous medium. We\nfind ansatzes reducing partial differential equations to systems of ordinary\ndifferential equations. The ansatzes are constructed by using operators of\nLie-B\\\"acklund symmetry of third order ordinary differential equation. The\nmethod gives the possibility to find solutions which cannot be obtained by\nvirtue of classical Lie method. Such solutions have been constructed for\nnonlinear diffusion equations which are invariant with respect to\none-parameter, two-parameter and three-parameter Lie groups of point\ntransformations.\n", "  Multi-peaked analytically extended function (AEF), previously applied by the\nauthors to modelling of lightning discharge currents, is used in this paper for\nrepresentation of the electrostatic discharge (ESD) currents. The fitting to\ndata is achieved by interpolation of certain data points. In order to minimize\nunstable behaviour, the exponents of the AEF are chosen from a certain\narithmetic sequence and the interpolated points are chosen according to a\nD-optimal design. ESD currents' modelling is illustrated through two examples:\none corresponding to an approximation of the IEC Standard 61000-4-2 waveshape,\nand the other to representation of some measured ESD current.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires have been shown to exhibit novel optoelectronic\nproperties with respect to bulk specimens made of the same material. However,\nif a semiconductor alloy has a miscibility gap in its phase diagram, at\nequilibrium it will phase separate, leading to deterioration of the\naforementioned properties. One way to prevent this separation is to grow the\nmaterial at low temperatures and therefore to suppress kinetics. Such growth\noften needs to be followed by high-temperature annealing in order to rid the\nsystem of undesirable growth-induced defects. In this study, we propose a\nmethod to control phase separation in core-shell nanowires during high\ntemperature annealing by tailoring geometry and strain. Using a phase field\nmodel we determined that phase separation in nanowires begins at the free\nsurface and propagates into the bulk. We discovered that including a thin shell\naround the core delays the phase separation whereas a thick shell suppresses\nthe separation almost entirely.\n", "  During production of malt from barley seeds, cell walls and starch granules\nin the endosperm are degraded. Although this modification process is important\nfor malt quality, the modification patterns of individual barley seeds have yet\nto be reported. The use of destructive microscopy methods have previously\nlimited the investigations to ensemble averages.\n  X-ray dark-field radiography is a recent non-destructive imaging method which\nis sensitive to microstructural variations. In this study, the method was\napplied for quantitative in-situ monitoring of barley seeds. Microstructural\nchanges relating to water uptake and modification were monitored over a 43-55 h\nperiod.\n  Sub-resolution stress cracks as well as a dark-field signal believed to\noriginate from starch granules were detected. The evolution of the dark-field\nsignal followed the known modification pattern in barley seeds. Through image\nanalysis, quantitative parameters describing the movement of the front of the\nobserved pattern were obtained.\n  Based on these findings, X-ray dark-field radiography presents a possible\nnovel approach to monitor the modification of germinating barley seeds.\n", "  Two primitive near Earth asteroids, (101955) Bennu and (162173) Ryugu, will\nbe visited by a spacecraft with the aim of returning samples back to Earth.\nSince these objects are believed to originate in the inner main belt primitive\ncollisional families (Erigone, Polana, Clarissa, and Sulamitis) or in the\nbackground of asteroids outside these families, the characterization of these\nprimitive populations will enhance the scientific return of the missions. The\nmain goal of this work is to shed light on the composition of the Erigone\ncollisional family by means of visible spectroscopy. Asteroid (163) Erigone has\nbeen classified as a primitive object, and we expect the members of this family\nto be consistent with the spectral type of the parent body. We have obtained\nvisible spectra (0.5 to 0.9 microns) for 101 members of the Erigone family,\nusing the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We found\nthat 87 percent of the objects have typically primitive visible spectra\nconsistent with that of (163) Erigone. In addition, we found that a significant\nfraction of these objects (approximately 50 percent) present evidence of\naqueous alteration.\n", "  Any quantum algorithm can be implemented by an adaptive sequence of single\nnode measurements on an entangled cluster of qubits in a square lattice\ntopology. Photons are a promising candidate for encoding qubits but assembling\na photonic entangled cluster with linear optical elements relies on\nprobabilistic operations. Given a supply of $n$-photon-entangled microclusters,\nusing a linear optical circuit and photon detectors, one can assemble a random\nentangled state of photons that can be subsequently \"renormalized\" into a\nlogical cluster for universal quantum computing. In this paper, we prove that\nthere is a fundamental tradeoff between $n$ and the minimum success probability\n$\\lambda_c^{(n)}$ that each two-photon linear-optical fusion operation must\nhave, in order to guarantee that the resulting state can be renormalized:\n$\\lambda_c^{(n)} \\ge 1/(n-1)$. We present a new way of formulating this problem\nwhere $\\lambda_c^{(n)}$ is the bond percolation threshold of a logical graph\nand provide explicit constructions to produce a percolated cluster using $n=3$\nphoton microclusters (GHZ states) as the initial resource. We settle a\nheretofore open question by showing that a renormalizable cluster can be\ncreated with $3$-photon microclusters over a 2D graph without feedforward,\nwhich makes the scheme extremely attractive for an integrated-photonic\nrealization. We also provide lattice constructions, which show that $0.5 \\le\n\\lambda_c^{(3)} \\le 0.5898$, improving on a recent result of $\\lambda_c^{(3)}\n\\le 0.625$. Finally, we discuss how losses affect the bounds on the threshold,\nusing loss models inspired by a recently-proposed method to produce photonic\nmicroclusters using quantum dot emitters.\n", "  We prove stochastic stability of chaotic maps for a general class of Markov\nrandom perturbations (including singular ones) satisfying some kind of mixing\nconditions. One of the consequences of this statement is the proof of Ulam's\nconjecture about the approximation of the dynamics of a chaotic system by a\nfinite state Markov chain. Conditions under which the localization phenomenon\n(i.e. stabilization of singular invariant measures) takes place are also\nconsidered. Our main tools are the so called bounded variation approach\ncombined with the ergodic theorem of Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu, and a random\nwalk argument that we apply to prove the absence of ``traps'' under the action\nof random perturbations.\n"]}
