These limits are\nbased on two searches. In the first we assume that the gravitational wave\nemission follows the observed radio timing, giving an upper limit on\ngravitational wave emission that beats indirect limits inferred from the\nspin-down and braking index of the pulsar and the energetics of the nebula. In\nthe second we allow for a small mismatch between the gravitational and radio\nsignal frequencies and interpret our results in the context of two possible\ngravitational wave emission mechanisms.\n", "  We investigate negative spectra of 1--D Schr\\\"odinger operators with\n$\\delta$- and $\\delta'$-interactions on a discrete set in the framework of a\nnew approach. Namely, using technique of boundary triplets and the\ncorresponding Weyl functions, we complete and generalize the results of S.\nAlbeverio and L. Nizhnik. For instance, we propose the algorithm for\ndetermining the number of negative squares of the operator with\n$\\delta$-interactions. We also show that the number of negative squares of the\noperator with $\\delta'$-interactions equals the number of negative strengths.\n", "  The argument from naturalness is widely employed in contemporary quantum\nfield theory. Essentially a formalized aesthetic criterion, it received a\nmeaning in the debate on the Higgs mechanism, which goes beyond aesthetics. We\nfollow the history of technical definitions of fine tuning at the scale of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. It is argued that they give rise to a special\ninterpretation of probability, which we call Gedankenfrequency. By extension of\nits original meaning, the argument from naturalness is used to compare\ndifferent models beyond the Standard Model. We show that in this case\nnaturalness cannot be defined objectively. Rather, it functions as\nsocio-historical heuristics in particle physics and it contributes to the\nadvent of a probabilistic version of Popper's falsificationism.\n", "  In this paper, we develop the theory of bimodules over von Neumann algebras,\nwith an emphasis on categorical aspects. We clarify the relationship between\ndualizability and finite index. We also show that, for von Neumann algebras\nwith finite-dimensional centers, the Haagerup L^2-space and Connes fusion are\nfunctorial with respect to homorphisms of finite index. Along the way, we\ndescribe a string diagram notation for maps between bimodules that are not\nnecessarily bilinear.\n", "  We describe a coordinate-free perspective on conformal nets, as functors from\nintervals to von Neumann algebras. We discuss an operation of fusion of\nintervals and observe that a conformal net takes a fused interval to the fiber\nproduct of von Neumann algebras. Though coordinate-free nets do not a priori\nhave vacuum sectors, we show that there is a vacuum sector canonically\nassociated to any circle equipped with a conformal structure. This is the first\nin a series of papers constructing a 3-category of conformal nets, defects,\nsectors, and intertwiners.\n", "  Various interpretations of quantum mechanics, favored (or neglected) by John\nBell in the context of his non-locality theorem, are compared and discussed.\n", "  This paper elucidates the anomalous decay of the muon ascribed to extended\nwaves. Due to a large overlap of the parent and daughters, the transition\namplitude and probability for the neutrinos are modified from the standard\nformula. A rigorous probability from the von Neumann's fundamental principle of\nthe quantum mechanics at a large time interval $T$ is, $P=T\\Gamma + P^{(d)}$,\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is derived from the Fermi's golden rule, and $P^{(d)}$ is a\ncorrection term. A new term $P^{(d)}$ has origins in the overlapping waves, and\ninfluences the determinations of physical parameters. By including $P^{(d)}$,\nshort-baseline neutrino experiments with LSND, KARMEN, and MiniBooNE become\nconsistent each other and with the solar, long-baseline, and reactor\nexperiments within the three neutrinos. Byproduct is that the absolute neutrino\nmass of the neutrinos can be measured.\n", "  Conformal nets provide a mathematical formalism for conformal field theory.\nAssociated to a conformal net with finite index, we give a construction of the\n`bundle of conformal blocks', a representation of the mapping class groupoid of\nclosed topological surfaces into the category of finite-dimensional projective\nHilbert spaces. We also construct infinite-dimensional spaces of conformal\nblocks for topological surfaces with smooth boundary. We prove that the\nconformal blocks satisfy a factorization formula for gluing surfaces along\ncircles, and an analogous formula for gluing surfaces along intervals. We use\nthis interval factorization property to give a new proof of the modularity of\nthe category of representations of a conformal net.\n", "  We extend the theory of quasipotentials in dynamical systems by calculating,\nwithin a broad class of period-doubling maps, an exact potential for the\ncritical fluctuations of pitchfork bifurcations in the weak noise limit. These\nfar-from-equilibrium fluctuations are described by finite-size mean field\ntheory, placing their static properties in the same universality class as the\nIsing model on a complete graph. We demonstrate that the effective system size\nof noisy period-doubling bifurcations exhibits universal scaling behavior along\nperiod-doubling routes to chaos.\n", "  We consider bound states of strings which arise in 6d (1,0) SCFTs that are\nrealized in F-theory in terms of linear chains of spheres with negative\nself-intersections 1,2, and 4. These include the strings associated to N small\nE8 instantons, as well as the ones associated to M5 branes probing A and D type\nsingularities in M-theory or D5 branes probing ADE singularities in Type IIB\nstring theory. We find that these bound states of strings admit (0,4)\nsupersymmetric quiver descriptions and show how one can compute their elliptic\ngenera.\n", "  We investigate the usage of highly efficient error correcting codes of\nmultilevel systems to protect encoded quantum information from erasure errors\nand implementation to repetitively correct these errors. Our scheme makes use\nof quantum polynomial codes to encode quantum information and generalizes\nteleportation based error correction for multilevel systems to correct photon\nlosses and operation errors in a fault-tolerant manner. We discuss the\napplication of quantum polynomial codes to one-way quantum repeaters. For\nvarious types of operation errors, we identify different parameter regions\nwhere quantum polynomial codes can achieve a superior performance compared to\nqubit based quantum parity codes.\n", "  Throughout human history, people have used sight to learn about the world,\nbut only in relatively recent times the science of light has been developed.\nEgyptians and Mesopotamians made the first known lenses out of quartz, giving\nbirth to what was later known as optics. On the other hand, geometry is a\nbranch of mathematics that was born from practical studies concerning lengths,\nareas and volumes in the early cultures, although it was not put into axiomatic\nform until the 3rd century BC. In this work, we will discuss the connection\nbetween these two timeless topics and show some \"new things in old things\".\nThere has been several works in this direction, but taking into account the\ndidactic approach of the Enrico Fermi Summer School, we would like to address\nthe subject and our audience in a new light.\n", "  While the basic principles and limitations of conventional solar cells are\nwell understood, relatively little attention has gone toward maximizing the\npotential efficiency of photovoltaic devices based on shift currents. In this\nwork, we outline simple design principles for the optimization of shift\ncurrents for frequencies near the band gap, derived from the analysis of a\ngeneral effective model. The use of a novel sum rule allows us to express the\nband edge shift current in terms of a few model parameters and to show it\ndepends explicitly on wavefunctions via Berry connections in addition to\nstandard band structure. We use our approach to identify two new classes of\nshift current photovoltaics, ferroelectric polymer films and single-layer\northorhombic monochalcogenides such as GeS. We introduce tight-binding models\nfor these systems, and show that they exhibit the largest shift current\nresponsivities at the band edge reported so far. Moreover, exploring the\nparameter space of these models we find photoresponsivities that can exceed\n$100$ mA/W. Our results show how the study of the shift current via effective\nmodels allows one to improve the possible efficiency of devices based on this\nmechanism and better grasp their potential to compete with conventional solar\ncells.\n", "  We construct an algebra embedding of the quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$\ninto the quantum coordinate ring $\\mathcal{O}_q[G^{w_0,w_0}/H]$ of the reduced\nbig double Bruhat cell in $G$. This embedding factors through the Heisenberg\ndouble $\\mathcal{H}_q$ of the quantum Borel subalgebra $U_{\\geq0}$, which we\nrelate to $\\mathcal{O}_q[G]$ via twisting by the longest element of the quantum\nWeyl group. Our construction is inspired by the Poisson geometry of the\nGrothendieck-Springer resolution studied by Evens and Lu, and the quantum\nBeilinson-Bernstein theorem investigated by Backelin, Kremnitzer, and Tanisaki.\n", "  We extend the magnetic connection theorem of ideal magnetohydrodynamics to\nnonideal relativistic pair plasmas. Adopting a generalized Ohm's law, we prove\nthe existence of generalized magnetofluid connections that are preserved by the\nplasma dynamics. We show that these connections are related to a general\nantisymmetric tensor that unifies the electromagnetic and fluid fields. The\ngeneralized magnetofluid connections set important constraints on the plasma\ndynamics by forbidding transitions between configurations with different\nmagnetofluid connectivity. An approximated solution is explicitly shown where\nthe corrections due to current inertial effects are found.\n", "  Frustrated systems, typically characterized by competing interactions that\ncannot all be simultaneously satisfied, display rich behaviours not found\nelsewhere in nature. Artificial spin ice takes a materials-by-design approach\nto studying frustration, where lithographically patterned bar magnets mimic the\nfrustrated interactions in real materials but are also amenable to direct\ncharacterization. Here, we introduce controlled topological defects into square\nartificial spin ice lattices in the form of lattice edge dislocations and\ndirectly observe the resulting spin configurations. We find the presence of a\ntopological defect produces extended frustration within the system caused by a\ndomain wall with indeterminate configuration. Away from the dislocation, the\nmagnets are locally unfrustrated, but frustration of the lattice persists due\nto its topology. Our results demonstrate the non-trivial nature of topological\ndefects in a new context, with implications for many real systems in which a\ntypical density of dislocations could fully frustrate a canonically\nunfrustrated system.\n", "  Establishing a quantum interface between different physical systems is of\nspecial importance for developing the practical versatile quantum networks.\nEntanglement between low- and high-lying atomic spin waves is essential for\nbuilding up Rydberg-based quantum information engineering, otherwhile be more\nhelpful to study the dynamics behavior of entanglement under external pertur-\nbations. Here, we report on the successful storage of a single photon as a\nhigh-lying atomic spin wave in quantum regime. Via storing a K-vector\nentanglement between single photon and lowly lying spin wave, we thereby\nexperimentally realize the entanglement between low- and high-lying atomic spin\nwaves in two separated atomic systems. This makes our experiment the primary\ndemonstration of Rydberg quantum memory of entanglement, making a primary step\ntoward the construction of a hybrid quantum interface.\n", "  In this paper, we study the anisotropy classes of the fourth order elastic\ntensors of the relaxed micromorphic model, also introducing their second order\ncounterpart by using a Voigt-type vector notation. In strong contrast with the\nusual micromorphic theories, in our relaxed micromorphic model only classical\nelasticity-tensors with at most 21 independent components are studied together\nwith rotational coupling tensors with at most 6 independent components. We show\nthat in the limit case $L_c\\rightarrow 0$ (which corresponds to considering\nvery large specimens of a microstructured metamaterial the meso- and\nmicro-coefficients of the relaxed model can be put in direct relation with the\nmacroscopic stiffness of the medium via a fundamental homogenization formula.\nWe also show that a similar homogenization formula is not possible in the case\nof the standard Mindlin-Eringen-format of the anisotropic micromorphic model.\nOur results allow us to forecast the successful short term application of the\nrelaxed micromorphic model to the characterization of anisotropic mechanical\nmetamaterials.\n", "  The topology of many real complex networks has been conjectured to be\nembedded in hidden metric spaces, where distances between nodes encode their\nlikelihood of being connected. Besides of providing a natural geometrical\ninterpretation of their complex topologies, this hypothesis yields the recipe\nfor sustainable Internet's routing protocols, sheds light on the hierarchical\norganization of biochemical pathways in cells, and allows for a rich\ncharacterization of the evolution of international trade. We present empirical\nevidence that this geometric interpretation also applies to the weighted\norganisation of real complex networks. We introduce a very general and\nversatile model and use it to quantify the level of coupling between their\ntopology, their weights, and an underlying metric space. Our model accurately\nreproduces both their topology and their weights, and our results suggest that\nthe formation of connections and the assignment of their magnitude are ruled by\ndifferent processes.\n", "  Arborescent knots are the ones which can be represented in terms of double\nfat graphs or equivalently as tree Feynman diagrams. This is the class of knots\nfor which the present knowledge is enough for lifting topological description\nto the level of effective analytical formulas. The paper describes the origin\nand structure of the new tables of colored knot polynomials, which will be\nposted at the dedicated site. Even if formal expressions are known in terms of\nmodular transformation matrices, the computation in finite time requires\nadditional ideas. We use the \"family\" approach, and apply it to arborescent\nknots in the Rolfsen table by developing a Feynman diagram technique associated\nwith an auxiliary matrix model field theory. Gauge invariance in this theory\nhelps to provide meaning to Racah matrices in the case of non-trivial\nmultiplicities and explains the need for peculiar sign prescriptions in the\ncalculation of [21]-colored HOMFLY polynomials.\n", "  In the presence of strong disorder and weak interactions, closed quantum\nsystems can enter a many-body localized phase where the system does not\nconduct, does not equilibrate even for arbitrarily long times, and robustly\nviolates quantum statistical mechanics. The starting point for such a many-body\nlocalized phase is usually taken to be an Anderson insulator where, in the\nlimit of vanishing interactions, all degrees of freedom of the system are\nlocalized. Here, we instead consider a model where in the non-interacting\nlimit, some degrees of freedom are localized while others remain delocalized.\nSuch a system can be viewed as a model for a many-body localized system brought\ninto contact with a small bath of a comparable number of degrees of freedom. We\nnumerically and analytically study the effect of interactions on this system\nand find that generically, the entire system delocalizes. However, we find\ncertain parameter regimes where results are consistent with localization of the\nentire system, an effect recently termed many-body proximity effect.\n", "  It is shown that the study of the imaginary part and of the corresponding\ndispersion relations of Feynman graph amplitudes within the differential\nequations method can provide a powerful tool for the solution of the equations,\nespecially in the massive case. The main features of the approach are\nillustrated by discussing the simple cases of the 1-loop self-mass and of a\nparticular vertex amplitude, and then used for the evaluation of the two-loop\nmassive sunrise and the QED kite graph (the problem studied by Sabry in 1962),\nup to first order in the (d-4) expansion.\n", "  We obtain bounds on the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the\n$t$-quark from a future high-energy and high-luminosity linear electron\npositron collider, such as the CLIC, with unpolarized and polarized electron\nbeams which are a powerful tool to determine new physics. We consider the\nprocesses $\\gamma e^- \\to \\bar t b\\nu_e$ ($\\gamma$ is the Compton\nbackscattering photon) and $e^+e^- \\to e^-\\gamma^* e^+ \\to \\bar t b\\nu_e e^+$\n($\\gamma^*$ is the Weizsacker-Williams photon) which are one of the most\nimportant sources of single top quark production. For the systematic\nuncertainties of $\\delta_{sys}=0\\%,\\hspace{1mm}5\\%$, $b-\\mbox{tagging\nefficiency}=0.8$, center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=3\\hspace{0.8mm}TeV$,\nintegrated luminosity of ${\\cal L}=2\\hspace{0.5mm}ab^{-1}$ and\n$2\\sigma\\hspace{1mm}(3\\sigma)$ C.L. the future $e^+e^-$ collider may put bounds\non the electromagnetic dipole moments $\\hat a_V$ and $\\hat a_A$ of the top\nquark of the order of ${\\cal O}(10^{-2}-10^{-1})$, which are highly competitive\nwith those recently reported in previous studies.\n", "  We demonstrate the suppression of photon shot noise dephasing in a\nsuperconducting qubit by eliminating its dispersive coupling to the readout\ncavity. This is achieved in a tunable coupling qubit, where the qubit frequency\nand coupling rate can be controlled independently. We observe that the\ncoherence time approaches twice the relaxation time and becomes less sensitive\nto thermal photon noise when the dispersive coupling rate is tuned from several\nMHz to 22 kHz. This work provides a promising building block in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics that can hold high coherence and be integrated into larger\nsystems.\n", "  One of the main interest in quantum cosmology is to determine boundary\nconditions for the wave function of the universe which can predict\nobservational data of our universe. For this purpose, we solve the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation for a closed universe with a scalar field numerically\nand evaluate probabilities for boundary conditions of the wave function of the\nuniverse. To impose boundary conditions of the wave function, we use exact\nsolutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with a constant scalar field\npotential. These exact solutions include wave functions with well known\nboundary condition proposals, the no-boundary proposal and the tunneling\nproposal. We specify the exact solutions by introducing two real parameters to\ndiscriminate boundary conditions, and obtain the probability for these\nparameters under the requirement of sufficient e-foldings of the inflation. The\nprobability distribution of boundary conditions prefers the tunneling boundary\ncondition to the no-boundary boundary condition. Furthermore, for large values\nof a model parameter related to the inflaton mass and the cosmological\nconstant, the probability of boundary conditions selects an unique boundary\ncondition different from the tunneling type.\n", "  The International System of Units (SI) is fundamental for the social, and not\nonly the scientific, role of metrology, and as such its understandability is a\ncrucial issue. According to the current draft of the new SI Brochure, the next\nedition of the SI will be significantly more complex in its conceptual\nstructure than the previous ones. Identifying a strategy for effectively\ncommunicating its main contents is then a worthwhile endeavor, in order to\nincrease the acceptance and thus the sustainability of the SI itself. Our\nproposal is to focus on the semantic structure of the definitions: this is\ninstrumental to the awareness campaigns recommended by the General Conference\non Weights and Measures to make the next edition of the SI understandable by a\ndiverse readership without compromising scientific rigor.\n", "  Based on the modular functor associated with a -- not necessarily semisimple\n-- finite non-degenerate ribbon category $\\mathcal D$, we present a definition\nof a consistent system of bulk field correlators for a conformal field theory\nwhich comprises invariance under mapping class group actions and compatibility\nwith the sewing of surfaces. We show that when restricting to surfaces of genus\nzero such systems are in bijection with commutative symmetric Frobenius\nalgebras in $\\mathcal D$, while for surfaces of any genus they are in bijection\nwith modular Frobenius algebras in $\\mathcal D$. This provides additional\ninsight into structures familiar from rational conformal field theories and\nextends them to rigid logarithmic conformal field theories.\n", "  Using dielectric spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, we have\nperformed a detailed investigation of the influence of water uptake on the\ntranslational and reorientational glassy dynamics in the typical ionic liquid\n1-Butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride. From a careful analysis of the measured\ndielectric permittivity and conductivity spectra, we find a significant\nacceleration of cation reorientation and a marked increase of the ionic\nconductivity for higher water contents. The latter effect mainly arises due to\na strong impact of water content on the glass temperature, which for the\nwell-dried material is found to be larger than any values reported in\nliterature for this system. The fragility, characterizing the non-Arrhenius\nglassy dynamics of the ionic subsystem, also changes with varying water\ncontent. Decoupling of the ionic motion from the structural dynamics has to be\nconsidered to explain the results.\n", "  Exotic phases of matter can emerge from strong correlations in quantum\nmany-body systems. Quantum gas microscopy affords the opportunity to study\nthese correlations with unprecedented detail. Here we report site-resolved\nobservations of antiferromagnetic correlations in a two-dimensional,\nHubbard-regime optical lattice and demonstrate the ability to measure the\nspin-correlation function over any distance. We measure the in-situ\ndistributions of the particle density and magnetic correlations, extract\nthermodynamic quantities from comparisons to theory, and observe statistically\nsignificant correlations over three lattice sites. The temperatures that we\nreach approach the limits of available numerical simulations. The direct access\nto many-body physics at the single-particle level demonstrated by our results\nwill further our understanding of how the interplay of motion and magnetism\ngives rise to new states of matter.\n", "  The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the field of Complex Social\nNetworks. Several network generation models have been extensively studied to\ndevelop an understanding of how real world networks evolve over time. Two\nimportant applications of these models are to study the evolution dynamics and\nprocesses that shape a network, and to generate benchmark networks with known\ncommunity structures. Research has been conducted in both these directions,\nrelatively independent of the other. This creates a disjunct between real world\nnetworks and the networks generated as benchmarks to study community detection\nalgorithms.\n  In this paper, we propose to study both these application areas together. We\nintroduce a network generation model which is based on evolution dynamics of\nreal world networks and, it can generate networks with community structures\nthat can be used as benchmark graphs. We study the behaviour of different\ncommunity detection algorithms based on the proposed model and compare it with\nother models to generate benchmark graphs. Results suggest that the proposed\nmodel can generate networks which are not only structurally similar to real\nworld networks but can be used to generate networks with varying community\nsizes and topologies.\n", "  We probe the anisotropy of the large-scale structure (LSS) with the\nWISE-2MASS catalogue. This analysis is performed by a directional comparison of\nthe galaxy number counts through the entire celestial sphere once systematic\neffects, such as star-galaxy separation and foregrounds contamination, are\nproperly taken into account. We find a maximal hemispherical asymmetry whose\ndipolar component is $A = 0.0507 \\pm 0.0014$ toward the $(l,b) =\n(323^{\\circ},-5^{\\circ})$ direction, whose result is consistent with previous\nestimations of our proper motion in low and intermediate redshifts, as those\ncarried out with Type Ia Supernovae and similar LSS catalogues. Furthermore,\nthis dipole amplitude is statistically consistent ($p$-value = $0.061$) with\nmock catalogues simulated according to the expected $\\Lambda$CDM matter density\nfluctuations, in addition to observational biases such as the incomplete\ncelestial coverage and anisotropic sky exposure. Our results suggest,\ntherefore, that there is no strong evidence for anomalous anisotropy in the\nLSS, given the limitations and systematics of current data, in the concordance\nmodel scenario.\n", "  The Einstein static (ES) universe has played a major role in various emergent\nscenarios recently proposed in order to cure the problem of initial singularity\nof the standard model of cosmology. In the herein model, we study the existence\nand stability of ES universe in the context of $f(R,T)$ modified theories of\ngravity. Considering specific forms of $f(R,T)$ function, we seek for the\nexistence of solutions representing ES state. Using dynamical system techniques\nalong with numerical analysis, we find two classes of solutions: the first one\nis always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so that\nits dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point. The\nimportance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty they\nhave in constructing non-singular emergent models in which the universe could\nhave experienced past-eternally, a series of infinite oscillations about such\nan initial static state after which, it enters through a suitable physical\nmechanism, to an inflationary era. Considering specific forms for the\nfunctionality of $f(R,T)$, we show that this theory is capable of providing\ncosmological solutions which admit emergent universe (EU) scenarios. We also\ninvestigate homogeneous scalar perturbations for the mentioned models. The\nstability regions of the solutions are parametrized by a linear equation of\nstate (EoS) parameter and other free parameters that will be introduced for the\nmodels. Our results suggest that modifications in $f(R,T)$ gravity would lead\nto stable solutions which are unstable in $f(R)$ gravity model.\n", "  The advent of controlled experimental accessibility of Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, as realized with e.g. cold atomic gases, exciton-polaritons, and\nmore recently photons in a dye-filled optical microcavity, has paved the way\nfor new studies and tests of a plethora of fundamental concepts in quantum\nphysics. We here describe recent experiments studying a transition between\nlaser-like dynamics and Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in the dye\nmicrocavity system. Further, measurements of the second-order coherence of the\nphoton condensate are presented. In the condensed state we observe photon\nnumber fluctuations of order of the total particle number, as understood from\neffective particle exchange with the photo-excitable dye molecules. The\nobserved intensity fluctuation properties give evidence for Bose-Einstein\ncondensation occurring in the grand-canonical statistical ensemble regime.\n", "  We explore the behaviour of an ensemble of chaotic oscillators coupled only\nto an external chaotic system, whose intrinsic dynamics may be similar or\ndissimilar to the group. Counter-intuitively, we find that a dissimilar\nexternal system manages to suppress the intrinsic chaos of the oscillators to\nfixed point dynamics, at sufficiently high coupling strengths. So, while\nsynchronization is induced readily by coupling to an identical external system,\ncontrol to fixed states is achieved only if the external system is dissimilar.\nWe quantify the efficacy of control by estimating the fraction of random\ninitial states that go to fixed points, a measure analogous to basin stability.\nLastly, we indicate the generality of this phenomenon by demonstrating\nsuppression of chaotic oscillations by coupling to a common hyper-chaotic\nsystem. These results then indicate the easy controllability of chaotic\noscillators by an external chaotic system, thereby suggesting a potent method\nthat may help design control strategies.\n", "  Electron-phonon coupling directly determines the stability of cooperative\norder in solids, including superconductivity, charge and spin density waves.\nTherefore, the ability to enhance or reduce electron-phonon coupling by optical\ndriving may open up new possibilities to steer materials' functionalities,\npotentially at high speeds. Here we explore the response of bilayer graphene to\ndynamical modulation of the lattice, achieved by driving optically-active\nin-plane bond stretching vibrations with femtosecond mid-infrared pulses. The\ndriven state is studied by two different ultrafast spectroscopic techniques.\nFirstly, TeraHertz time-domain spectroscopy reveals that the Drude scattering\nrate decreases upon driving. Secondly, the relaxation rate of hot\nquasi-particles, as measured by time- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, increases. These two independent observations are quantitatively\nconsistent with one another and can be explained by a transient three-fold\nenhancement of the electron-phonon coupling constant. The findings reported\nhere provide useful perspective for related experiments, which reported the\nenhancement of superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerites when a similar\nphonon mode was driven.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium properties of a nonergodic random quantum chain\nin which highly excited eigenstates exhibit critical properties usually\nassociated with quantum critical ground states. The ground state and excited\nstates of this system belong to different universality classes, characterized\nby infinite-randomness quantum critical behavior. Using strong-disorder\nrenormalization group techniques, we show that the crossover between the zero\nand finite energy density regimes is universal. We analytically derive a flow\nequation describing the unitary dynamics of this isolated system at finite\nenergy density from which we obtain universal scaling functions along the\ncrossover.\n", "  Anderson et al have claimed to find evidence for periodic sinusoidal\nvariations (period=5.9 years) in measurements of Newton's Gravitational\nconstant. These claims have been disputed by Pitkin. Using Bayesian model\ncomparison, he argues that a model with an unknown Gaussian noise component is\nfavored over any periodic variations by more than $e^{30}$. We re-examine the\nclaims of Anderson et al using frequentist model comparison tests, both with\nand without errors in the measurement times. Our findings lend support to\nPitkin's claim that a constant term along with an unknown systematic offset\nprovides a better fit to the measurements of Newton's constant, compared to any\nsinusoidal variations.\n", "  In this note we provide some details on the quasi-local field redefinitions\nwhich map interactions extracted from Vasiliev's equations to those obtained\nvia holographic reconstruction. Without loss of generality, we focus on the\nsource to the Fronsdal equations induced by current interactions quadratic in\nthe higher-spin linearised curvatures.\n", "  We analyze a new class of FCNC processes, the $f \\to f^{\\prime} \\,\n\\bar{\\gamma}$ decays of a fermion $f$ into a lighter (same-charge) fermion\n$f^{\\prime}$ plus a {\\it massless} neutral vector boson, a {\\it dark photon}\n$\\bar{\\gamma}$. A massless dark photon does not interact at tree level with\nobservable fields, and the $f \\!\\to\\! f^{\\prime} \\, \\bar{\\gamma}$ decay\npresents a characteristic signature where the final fermion $f^{\\prime}$ is\nbalanced by a {\\it massless invisible} system. Models recently proposed to\nexplain the exponential spread in the standard-model Yukawa couplings can\nindeed foresee an extra unbroken {\\it dark} $U(1)$ gauge group, and the\npossibility to couple on-shell dark photons to standard-model fermions via\none-loop magnetic-dipole kind of FCNC interactions. The latter are suppressed\nby the characteristic scale related to the mass of heavy messengers, connecting\nthe standard model particles to the dark sector. We compute the corresponding\ndecay rates for the top, bottom, and charm decays ($t\\to c\\, \\bar{\\gamma},u\\,\n\\bar{\\gamma}$, $\\;b\\to s\\, \\bar{\\gamma},d\\, \\bar{\\gamma}$, and $c\\to u\n\\bar{\\gamma}$), and for the charged-lepton decays ($\\tau \\to \\mu\\,\n\\bar{\\gamma}, e\\, \\bar{\\gamma}$, and $\\mu \\to e \\bar{\\gamma}$) in terms of\nmodel parameters. We find that large branching ratios for both quark and lepton\ndecays are allowed in case the messenger masses are in the discovery range of\nthe LHC. Implications of these new decay channels at present and future\ncollider experiments are briefly discussed.\n", "  Atomic clocks based on optical transitions are the most stable, and therefore\nprecise, timekeepers available. These clocks operate by alternating intervals\nof atomic interrogation with dead time required for quantum state preparation\nand readout. This non-continuous interrogation of the atom system results in\nthe Dick effect, an aliasing of frequency noise of the laser interrogating the\natomic transition. Despite recent advances in optical clock stability achieved\nby improving laser coherence, the Dick effect has continually limited optical\nclock performance. Here we implement a robust solution to overcome this\nlimitation: a zero-dead-time optical clock based on the interleaved\ninterrogation of two cold-atom ensembles. This clock exhibits vanishingly small\nDick noise, thereby achieving an unprecedented fractional frequency instability\nof $6 \\times 10^{-17} / \\sqrt{\\tau}$ for an averaging time $\\tau$ in seconds.\nWe also consider alternate dual-atom-ensemble schemes to extend laser coherence\nand reduce the standard quantum limit of clock stability, achieving a\nspectroscopy line quality factor $Q> 4 \\times 10^{15}$.\n", "  Plasmonic biosensing chips were prepared by fabricating wavelength-scaled\ndielectric-metal interfacial gratings on polymer film covered bimetal layers.\nLysozyme biomolecules (LYZ) and gold nanoparticle bioconjugates (AuNP-LYZ) with\n1:5 mass ratio were seeded onto the biochip surfaces. Comparison of the\nreflectance curves measured in a modified Kretschmann arrangement and computed\nnumerically proved that monitoring the narrower secondary peaks under optimal\nrotated-grating coupling condition makes it possible to achieve enhanced\nsensitivity in biodetection. The enlarged resonance peak shift is due to the\nhorizontally and vertically antisymmetric long-range plamonic modes propagating\nat the edge of the valleys and hills, which originate from Bragg scattered\nsurface plasmon polaritons. The sensitivity is further increased in case of\nbioconjugates due to the coupled localized resonances on Au NPs.\n", "  In frustrated magnets the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction arising from\nspin-orbit coupling can induce a magnetic long-range order. Here, we report a\ntheoretical prediction of thermal Hall effect in frustrated kagom\\'e magnets\nsuch as KCr$_3$(OH)$_6$(SO4)$_2$ and KFe$_3$(OH)$_{6}$(SO$_{4}$)$_2$. The\nthermal Hall effects in these materials are induced by scalar spin chirality as\nopposed to DMI in previous studies. The scalar spin chirality originates from\nmagnetic-field-induced chiral spin configuration due to non-coplanar spin\ntextures, but in general it can be spontaneously developed as a macroscopic\norder parameter in chiral quantum spin liquids. Therefore, we infer that there\nis a possibility of thermal Hall effect in frustrated kagom\\'e magnets such as\nherbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and the chromium compound\nCa$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, although they also show evidence of magnetic order in\nthe presence of a magnetic field or pressure.\n", "  Using a nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the wave function of all\nsystems, continuous transitions between quantum and classical motions are\ndemonstrated for (i) the double-slit set up, (ii) the 2D harmonic oscillator\nand (iii) the hydrogen-like atom, all of which are of empirical interest.\n", "  We present FlexibleEFTHiggs, a method for calculating the SM-like Higgs pole\nmass in SUSY (and even non-SUSY) models, which combines an effective field\ntheory approach with a diagrammatic calculation. It thus achieves an all order\nresummation of leading logarithms together with the inclusion of all\nnon-logarithmic 1-loop contributions. We implement this method into\nFlexibleSUSY and study its properties in the MSSM, NMSSM, E6SSM and MRSSM. In\nthe MSSM, it correctly interpolates between the known results of effective\nfield theory calculations in the literature for a high SUSY scale and\nfixed-order calculations in the full theory for a sub-TeV SUSY scale. We\ncompare our MSSM results to those from public codes and identify the origin of\nthe most significant deviations between the DR-bar programs. We then perform a\nsimilar comparison in the remaining three non-minimal models. For all four\nmodels we estimate the theoretical uncertainty of FlexibleEFTHiggs and the\nfixed-order DR-bar programs thereby finding that the former becomes more\nprecise than the latter for a SUSY scale above a few TeV. Even for sub-TeV SUSY\nscales, FlexibleEFTHiggs maintains the uncertainty estimate around 2-3 GeV,\nremaining a competitive alternative to existing fixed-order computations.\n", "  We report the absolute frequency measurement of the unperturbed transition\n1S0 - 3P0 at 578 nm in 171Yb realized in an optical lattice frequency standard.\nThe absolute frequency is measured 518 295 836 590 863.55(28) Hz relative to a\ncryogenic caesium fountain with a fractional uncertainty of 5.4x10-16 . This\nvalue is in agreement with the ytterbium frequency recommended as a secondary\nrepresentation of the second in the International System of Units.\n", "  A new breakthrough in jet propulsion technology since the invention of the\njet engine is achieved. The first critical tests for future air-breathing\nmagneto-plasma propulsion systems have been successfully completed. In this\nregard, it is also the first time that a pinching dense plasma focus discharge\ncould be ignited at one atmosphere and driven in pulse mode using very fast,\nnanosecond electrostatic excitations to induce self-organized plasma channels\nfor ignition of the propulsive main discharge. Depending on the capacitor\nvoltage (200-600 V) the energy input at one atmosphere varies from 52-320\nJ/pulse corresponding to impulse bits from 1.2-8.0 mNs. Such a new pulsed\nplasma propulsion system driven with one thousand pulses per second would\nalready have thrust-to-area ratios (50-150 kN/m2) of modern jet engines. An\narray of thrusters could enable future aircrafts and airships to start from\nground and reach altitudes up to 50km and beyond. The needed high power could\nbe provided by future compact plasma fusion reactors already in development by\naerospace companies. The magneto-plasma compressor itself was originally\ndeveloped by Russian scientists as plasma fusion device and was later\nminiaturized for supersonic flow control applications. So the first\nbreakthrough is based on a spin-off plasma fusion technology.\n", "  We report $^{31}$P and $^{29}$Si NMR in single crystals of\nURu$_2$Si$_{2-x}$P$_x$ for $x=0.09$ and $x=0.33$. The spectra in the $x=0.33$\nsample are consistent with a homogenous commensurate antiferromagnetic phase\nbelow $T_N \\sim 37$ K. The Knight shift exhibits an anomaly at the coherence\ntemperature, $T^*$, that is slightly enhanced with P doping. Spin lattice\nrelaxation rate data indicate that the density of states is suppressed for\n$x=0.09$ below 30 K, similar to the undoped compound, but there is no evidence\nof long range order at this concentration. Our results suggest that Si\nsubstitution provides chemical pressure without inducing electronic\ninhomogeneity.\n", "  We theoretically investigate two different magnetic tunneling junctions\n(MTJs) with semiconductor barriers, CuInSe${}_{2}$ (CIS) and CuGaSe${}_{2}$\n(CGS), which are the terminal compounds of recently reported mixed\nsemiconductor barrier, CuIn${}_{1-x}$Ga$_{\\it x}$Se${}_{2}$. To discuss the\ntransport properties of these systems, we analyze complex band structures,\nmagnetoresistance (MR) ratios, and resistance-area products ($RA$) by using\nfirst-principles based calculations in combination with the Landauer formula.\nIt is found that the $\\Delta_{1}$ wave functions have dominant contributions to\nthe spin-dependent tunneling transport in both CIS- and CGS-based MTJs. We also\nfind that the CGS-based MTJ has a much larger MR ratio and slightly higher $RA$\nthan those of the CIS-based MTJ, which indicates that a larger MR ratio is\nexpected for a higher Ga concentration $x$ in the\nCuIn${}_{1-x}$Ga${}_{x}$Se${}_{2}$-based MTJs. We further study the\nrelationship between the band gaps in the barriers and MR ratios by changing\nthe Coulomb repulsions in the Cu 3$d$ states of the CIS and CGS. It is shown\nthat the barrier with a larger band gap yields a larger MR ratio. The\ncomparison of MR ratios and $RA$ between the CIS-, CGS-, and MgO-based MTJs are\nalso given.\n", "  Two very important problems regarding spreading phenomena in complex\ntopologies are the optimal selection of node sets either to minimize or\nmaximize the extent of outbreaks. Both problems are nontrivial when a small\nfraction of the nodes in the network can be used to achieve the desired goal.\nThe minimization problem is equivalent to a structural optimization. The\n\"superblockers\", i.e., the nodes that should be removed from the network to\nminimize the size of outbreaks, are those nodes that make connected components\nas small as possible. \"Superspreaders\" are instead the nodes such that, if\nchosen as initiators, they maximize the average size of outbreaks. The identity\nof superspreaders is expected to depend not just on the topology, but also on\nthe specific dynamics considered. Recently, it has been conjectured that the\ntwo optimization problems might be equivalent, in the sense that superblockers\nact also as superspreaders. In spite of its potential groundbreaking\nimportance, no empirical study has been performed to validate this conjecture.\nIn this paper, we perform an extensive analysis over a large set of real-world\nnetworks to test the similarity between sets of superblockers and of\nsuperspreaders. We show that the two optimization problems are not equivalent:\nsuperblockers do not act as optimal spreaders.\n", "  The $\\eta \\to 3 \\pi$ amplitude is sensitive to the quark mass difference\n$m_u-m_d$ and offers a unique way to determine the quark mass ratio $Q^2 \\equiv\n(m_s^2-m_{ud}^2)/(m_d^2-m_u^2)$ from experiment. We calculate the amplitude\ndispersively and fit the KLOE data on the charged mode, varying the subtraction\nconstants in the range allowed by chiral perturbation theory. The\nparameter-free predictions obtained for the neutral Dalitz plot and the\nneutral-to-charged branching ratio are in excellent agreement with experiment.\nOur representation of the transition amplitude implies $Q = 22.0 \\pm 0.7$.\n", "  A first investigation into the use of microwaves for the non-destructive\ntesting for the presence of black heart cavities is presented. Additionally a\npotato's complex permittivity data between 0.5 GHz to 20 GHz measured using a\ncoaxial sensor and the recipe for a potato phantom are also presented.\nElectromagnetic finite-difference time-domain simulations of potatoes show that\nchanges to how microwaves propagate through a potato caused by a cavity can\nproduce measurable changes in S21 at the potato's surface of up to 26 dB.\nLab-based readings of the change in S21 caused by a phantom cavity submerged in\na potato phantom liquid confirms the results of the simulation, albeit at a\nmuch reduced magnitude in the order of 0.1 dB.\n", "  The lacunar spinel GeV4S8 undergoes orbital and ferroelectric ordering at the\nJahn-Teller transition around 30 K and exhibits antiferromagnetic order below\nabout 14 K. In addition to this orbitally driven ferroelectricity, lacunar\nspinels are an interesting material class, as the vanadium ions form V4\nclusters representing stable molecular entities with a common electron\ndistribution and a well-defined level scheme of molecular states resulting in a\nunique spin state per V4 molecule. Here we report detailed x-ray, magnetic\nsusceptibility, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, thermal expansion, and\ndielectric results to characterize the structural, electric, dielectric,\nmagnetic, and thermodynamic properties of this interesting material, which also\nexhibits strong electronic correlations. From the magnetic susceptibility, we\ndetermine a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, indicative for antiferromagnetic\nexchange and a paramagnetic moment close to a spin S = 1 of the V4 molecular\nclusters. The low-temperature heat capacity provides experimental evidence for\ngapped magnon excitations. From the entropy release, we conclude about strong\ncorrelations between magnetic order and lattice distortions. In addition, the\nobserved anomalies at the phase transitions also indicate strong coupling\nbetween structural and electronic degrees of freedom. Utilizing dielectric\nspectroscopy, we find the onset of significant dispersion effects at the polar\nJahn-Teller transition. The dispersion becomes fully suppressed again with the\nonset of spin order. In addition, the temperature dependencies of dielectric\nconstant and specific heat possibly indicate a sequential appearance of orbital\nand polar order.\n", "  These lectures are centred around tree-level scattering amplitudes in pure\nYang-Mills theories, the most prominent example is given by the tree-level\ngluon amplitudes of QCD. I will discuss several ways of computing these\namplitudes, illustrating in this way recent developments in perturbative\nquantum field theory. Topics covered in these lectures include colour\ndecomposition, spinor and twistor methods, off- and on-shell recursion, MHV\namplitudes and MHV expansion, the Grassmannian and the amplituhedron, the\nscattering equations and the CHY representation. At the end of these lectures\nthere will be an outlook on the relation between pure Yang-Mills amplitudes and\nscattering amplitudes in perturbative quantum gravity.\n", "  We predict from first principles an entirely topological orbital\nmagnetization in the noncoplanar bulk antiferromagnet $\\gamma$-FeMn originating\nin the nontrivial topology of the underlying spin structure, without any\nreference to spin-orbit interaction. Studying the influence of strain,\ncomposition ratio, and spin texture on the topological orbital magnetization\nand the accompanying topological Hall effect, we promote the scalar spin\nchirality as key mechanism lifting the orbital degeneracy. The system is thus a\nprototypical topological orbital ferromagnet, the macroscopic orbital\nmagnetization of which is prominent even without spin-orbit coupling. One of\nthe remarkable features of $\\gamma$-FeMn is the possibility for pronounced\norbital magnetostriction mediated by the complex spin topology in real space.\n", "  The CIV broad emission line is visible in optical spectra to redshifts\nexceeding z~5. CIV has long been known to exhibit significant displacements to\nthe blue and these `blueshifts' almost certainly signal the presence of strong\noutflows. As a consequence, single-epoch virial black hole (BH) mass estimates\nderived from CIV velocity-widths are known to be systematically biased compared\nto masses from the hydrogen Balmer lines. Using a large sample of 230\nhigh-luminosity (log $L_{\\rm Bol}$ = 45.5-48 erg/s), redshift 1.5<z<4.0 quasars\nwith both CIV and Balmer line spectra, we have quantified the bias in CIV BH\nmasses as a function of the CIV blueshift. CIV BH masses are shown to be a\nfactor of five larger than the corresponding Balmer-line masses at CIV\nblueshifts of 3000 km/s and are over-estimated by almost an order of magnitude\nat the most extreme blueshifts, >5000 km/s. Using the monotonically increasing\nrelationship between the CIV blueshift and the mass ratio BH(CIV)/BH(H$\\alpha$)\nwe derive an empirical correction to all CIV BH-masses. The scatter between the\ncorrected CIV masses and the Balmer masses is 0.24 dex at low CIV blueshifts\n(~0 km/s) and just 0.10 dex at high blueshifts (~3000 km/s), compared to 0.40\ndex before the correction. The correction depends only on the CIV line\nproperties - i.e. full-width at half maximum and blueshift - and can therefore\nbe applied to all quasars where CIV emission line properties have been\nmeasured, enabling the derivation of un-biased virial BH mass estimates for the\nmajority of high-luminosity, high-redshift, spectroscopically confirmed quasars\nin the literature.\n", "  For the DNA denaturation transition in the presence of random contact\nenergies, or equivalently the disordered wetting transition, we introduce a\nStrong Disorder Renewal Approach to construct the optimal contacts in each\ndisordered sample of size $L$. The transition is found to be of infinite order,\nwith a correlation length diverging with the essential singularity $\\ln \\xi(T)\n\\propto |T-T_c |^{-1}$. In the critical region, we analyze the statistics over\nsamples of the free-energy density $f_L$ and of the contact density, which is\nthe order parameter of the transition. At the critical point, both decay as a\npower-law of the length $L$ but remain distributed, in agreement with the\ngeneral phenomenon of lack of self-averaging at random critical points. We also\nobtain that for any real $q>0$, the moment $\\overline{Z_L^q} $ of order $q$ of\nthe partition function at the critical point is dominated by some exponentially\nrare samples displaying a finite free-energy density, i.e. by the large\ndeviation sector of the probability distribution of the free-energy density.\n", "  Neutron star-black hole binaries are among the strongest sources of\ngravitational waves detectable by current observatories. They can also power\nbright electromagnetic signals (gamma-ray bursts, kilonovae), and may be a\nsignificant source of production of r-process nuclei. A misalignment of the\nblack hole spin with respect to the orbital angular momentum leads to\nprecession of that spin and of the orbital plane, and has a significant effect\non the properties of the post-merger remnant and of the material ejected by the\nmerger. We present a first set of simulations of precessing neutron star-black\nhole mergers using a hot, composition dependent, nuclear-theory based equation\nof state (DD2). We show that the mass of the remnant and of the dynamical\nejecta are broadly consistent with the result of simulations using simpler\nequations of state, while differences arise when considering the dynamics of\nthe merger and the velocity of the ejecta. We show that the latter can easily\nbe understood from assumptions about the composition of low-density, cold\nmaterial in the different equations of state, and propose an updated estimate\nfor the ejecta velocity which takes those effects into account. We also present\nan updated mesh-refinement algorithm which allows us to improve the numerical\nresolution used to evolve neutron star-black hole mergers.\n", "  We consider the gravitational lensing of rays emitted by a compact object\n(CO) within a distribution of plasma with power-law density $\\propto r^{-h}$.\nFor the simplest case of a cloud of spherically symmetric cold non-magnetized\nplasma, the diverging effect of the plasma and the converging effect of\ngravitational lensing compete with one another. When $h<2$, the plasma effect\ndominates over the vacuum Schwarzschild curvature, potentially shifting the\nradius of the unstable circular photon orbit outside the surface of the CO.\nWhen this occurs, we define two relatively narrow radio-frequency bands in\nwhich plasma effects are particularly significant. Rays in the escape window\nhave $\\omega_{0} < \\omega \\leq \\omega_{+}$ and are free to propagate to\ninfinity from the CO surface. To a distant observer, the visible portion of the\nCO surface appears to shrink as the observed frequency is reduced, and vanishes\nentirely at $\\omega_{0}$, in excess of the plasma frequency at the CO surface.\nWe define the anomalous propagation window for frequencies $\\omega_{-}< \\omega\n\\leq \\omega_{0}$. Rays emitted from the CO surface within this frequency range\nare dominated by optical effects from the plasma and curve back to the surface\nof the CO, effectively cloaking the star from distant observers. We conclude\nwith a study of neutron star (NS) compactness ratios for a variety of nuclear\nmatter equations of state (EoS). For $h=1$, NSs generated from stiff EoS should\ndisplay significant frequency dependence in the EW, and lower values of $h$\nwith softer EoS can also show these effects.\n", "  We have investigated the difference in persistence between male and female\nstudents while taking undergraduatephysics courses. To quantify the persistence\nof a certain group of students, we have defined 'persistence index' as the\ninverseof the decrease rate of the number of that group of students while\ntaking a specific course. We have collected the data fromthree consecutive\nworkshops on various topics of physics. After plotting the number of\nparticipations against the number ofdays attended, we have calculated the\ndecrease rates and persistence indices for both male and female student groups\non eachworkshop and compared the persistence indices on a bar diagram. The\ncomparative statistics show that the persistence indicesof female student\ngroups are significantly higher than that of male student groups. This leads us\nto the conclusion that thefemale students are more persistent than male\nstudents while taking an undergraduate physics course.\n", "  We select a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release\n7 (SDSS-DR7) where galaxies are classified, through visual inspection, as\nhosting strong bars, weak bars or as unbarred galaxies, and make use of HI mass\nand kinematic information from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey\ncatalog, to study the stellar, atomic gas and dark matter content of barred\ndisk galaxies. We find, in agreement with previous studies, that the bar\nfraction increases with increasing stellar mass. A similar trend is found with\ntotal baryonic mass, although the dependence is not as strong as with stellar\nmass, this due to the contribution of gas. The bar fraction shows a decrease\nwith increasing gas mass fraction. This anticorrelation between the likelihood\nof a galaxy hosting a bar with the gas richness of the galaxy results from the\ninhibiting effect the gas has in the formation of bars. We also find that for\nmassive galaxies with stellar masses larger than 10$^{10} M_{\\odot}$, at fixed\nstellar mass, the bar fraction decreases with increasing global halo mass (i.e.\nhalo mass measured up to a radius of the order of the HI disk extent).\n", "  We identify the families of states that maximise some recently proposed\nquantifiers of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and the volume of the\nQuantum Steering Ellipsoid (QSE). The optimal measurements which maximise\ngenuine EPR steering measures are discussed and we develop a novel way to find\nthem using the QSE. We thus explore the links between genuine EPR steering and\nthe QSE and introduce states that can be the most useful for one-sided\ndevice-independent quantum cryptography for a given amount of noise.\n", "  We consider a model of two-component dark matter based on a hidden $U(1)_D$\nsymmetry, in which relic densities of the dark matter are determined by\nforbidden channels and thermal freeze-out. The hidden $U(1)_D$ symmetry is\nspontaneously broken to a residual $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, and the lightest\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ charged particle can be a dark matter candidate. Moreover,\ndepending on the mass hierarchy in the dark sector, we have two-component dark\nmatter. We show that the relic density of the lighter dark matter component can\nbe determined by forbidden annihilation channels which require larger couplings\ncompared to the normal freeze-out mechanism. As a result, a large\nself-interaction of the lighter dark matter component can be induced, which may\nsolve small scale problems of $\\Lambda$CDM model. On the other hand, the\nheavier dark matter component is produced by normal freeze-out mechanism. We\nfind that interesting implications emerge between the two dark matter\ncomponents in this framework. We explore detectabilities of these dark matter\nparticles and show some parameter space can be tested by the SHiP experiment.\n", "  A special purpose solver, based on the Magnus expansion, well suited for the\nintegration of the linear three neutrino oscillations equations in matter is\nproposed. The computations are speeded up to two orders of magnitude with\nrespect to a general numerical integrator, a fact that could smooth the way for\nmassive numerical integration concomitant with experimental data analyses.\nDetailed illustrations about numerical procedure and computer time costs are\nprovided.\n", "  Since the discovery of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) in the last decade,\nit has been known that these events exhibit bluer spectral energy distributions\nthan other supernova subtypes, with significant output in the ultraviolet.\nHowever, the event Gaia16apd seems to outshine even the other SLSNe at\nrest-frame wavelengths below $\\sim 3000$ \\AA. Yan et al (2016) have recently\npresented HST UV spectra and attributed the UV flux to low metallicity and\nhence reduced line blanketing. Here we present UV and optical light curves over\na longer baseline in time, revealing a rapid decline at UV wavelengths despite\na typical optical evolution. Combining the published UV spectra with our own\noptical data, we demonstrate that Gaia16apd has a much hotter continuum than\nvirtually any SLSN at maximum light, but it cools rapidly thereafter and is\nindistinguishable from the others by $\\sim 10$-15 days after peak. Comparing\nthe equivalent widths of UV absorption lines with those of other events, we\nshow that the excess UV continuum is a result of a more powerful central power\nsource, rather than a lack of UV absorption relative to other SLSNe or an\nadditional component from interaction with the surrounding medium. These\nfindings strongly support the central-engine hypothesis for hydrogen-poor\nSLSNe. An explosion ejecting $M_{\\rm ej} = 4 (0.2/\\kappa)$ M$_\\odot$, where\n$\\kappa$ is the opacity in cm$^2$g$^{-1}$, and forming a magnetar with spin\nperiod $P=2$ ms, and $B=2\\times10^{14}$ G (lower than other SLSNe with\ncomparable rise-times) can consistently explain the light curve evolution and\nhigh temperature at peak. The host metallicity, $Z=0.18$ Z$_\\odot$, is\ncomparable to other SLSNe.\n", "  The $\\mu\\tau$-reflection symmetry is a simple symmetry capable of predicting\nall the unknown CP phases of the lepton sector and the atmospheric angle but\ntoo simple to predict the absolute neutrino mass scale or the mass ordering. We\nshow that by combining it with a discrete abelian symmetry in a nontrivial way\nwe can additionally enforce a texture-zero and obtain a highly predictive\nscenario where the lightest neutrino mass is fixed to be in the few meV range\nfor two normal ordering (NO) solutions or in the tens of meV in one inverted\nordering (IO) solution. The rate for neutrinoless double beta decay is\npredicted to be negligible for NO or have effective mass $m_{\\beta\\beta}\\approx\n14\\text{ -- }29\\,{\\rm meV}$ for IO, right in the region to be probed in future\nexperiments.\n", "  The possibility of channeling the low-energy relativistic positrons around\nseparate crystallographic axes with coaxial symmetry of negative ions in some\ntypes of crystals is shown. The process of annihilation of positrons with\nelectrons of medium was studied in detail.\n", "  We study fully supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua of half-maxi\\-mal $N=(1,1)$\ngauged supergravity in six space-time dimensions coupled to $n$ vector\nmultiplets. We show that the existence of $AdS_6$ backgrounds requires that the\ngauge group is of the form $G'\\times G\"\\subset SO(4,n)$ where $G'\\subset\nSO(3,m)$ and $G\"\\subset SO(1,n-m)$. In the $AdS_6$ vacua this gauge group is\nbroken to its maximal compact subgroup $SO(3)\\times H'\\times H\"$ where\n$H'\\subset SO(m)$ and $H\"\\subset SO(n-m)$. Furthermore, the $SO(3)$ factor is\nthe R-symmetry gauged by three of the four graviphotons. We further show that\nthe $AdS_6$ vacua have no moduli that preserve all supercharges. This is\nprecisely in agreement with the absence of supersymmetric marginal deformations\nin holographically dual five-dimensional superconformal field theories.\n", "  We discuss the quantum bound on chaos in the context of the free propagation\nof a particle in an arbitrarily curved surface at low temperatures. The\nsemiclassical calculation of the Lyapunov exponent can be performed in much the\nsame way as the corresponding one for the `Loschmidt echo'.The bound appears\nhere as the impossibility to scatter a wave, by effect of the curvature, over\ncharacteristic lengths smaller than the deBroglie wavelength.\n", "  In our model of quantum gravity the quantum development of a Cauchy\nhypersurface is governed by a wave equation derived as the result of a\ncanonical quantization process. To find physically interesting solutions of the\nwave equation we employ the separation of variables by considering a temporal\neigenvalue problem which has a complete countable set of eigenfunctions with\npositive eigenvalues and also a spatial eigenvalue problem which has a complete\nset of eigendistributions. Assuming that the Cauchy hypersurface is\nasymtotically Euclidean we prove that the temporal eigenvalues are also spatial\neigenvalues and the product of corresponding eigenfunctions and\neigendistributions, which will be smooth functions with polynomial growth, are\nthe physically interesting solutions of the wave equation. We consider these\nsolutions to describe the quantum development of the Cauchy hypersurface.\n", "  We reveal the origin of the CP violation required by the leptogenesis in\nvariously popular seesaw models. Especially we clarify that in a pure\ntype-I/III seesaw with two fermion singlets/triplets, a combined type-I+III\nseesaw with one fermion singlet and one fermion triplet, or a combined\ntype-I/III+II seesaw with one fermion singlet/triplet and one Higgs triplet,\nthe CP violation for the leptogenesis can exactly come from the imaginary part\nof the neutrino mass matrix in a special basis where the Yukawa couplings\ninvolving one fermion singlet/triplet are allowed to get rid of any CP phases.\nWe also generalize our findings as a very good approximation when these seesaw\nscenarios are extended by more fermion singlets/triplets and Higgs triplets\nwhile the leptogenesis is realized by the decays of the lightest fermion\nsinglet/triplet.\n", "  Oscillons are spatially stationary, quasi-periodic solutions of nonlinear\nfield theories seen in settings ranging from granular systems, low temperature\ncondensates and early universe cosmology. We describe a new class of oscillon\nin which the spatial envelope can have \"off centre\" maxima and pulsate on\ntimescales much longer than the fundamental frequency. These are exact\nsolutions of the 1-D sine-Gordon equation and we demonstrate numerically that\nsimilar solutions exist in up to three dimensions for a range of potentials.\nThe dynamics of these solutions match key properties of oscillons that may form\nafter cosmological inflation in string-motivated monodromy scenarios.\n", "  A simple model is presented to explain the Higgs boson physics to the grand\npublic. The model consists of a children ball pool representing a Universe\nfilled with a certain amount of the Higgs field. The model is suitable for\nusage as a hands-on tool in scientific exhibits and provides a clear\nexplanation of almost all the aspects of the physics of the Higgs field\ninteraction with other particles.\n", "  We describe the neutrino flavor (e = electron, u = muon, t = tau) masses as\nm(i=e;u;t)= m + [Delta]mi with |[Delta]mij|/m < 1 and probably |[Delta]mij|/m\n<< 1. The quantity m is the degenerate neutrino mass. Because neutrino flavor\nis not a quantum number, this degenerate mass appears in the neutrino equation\nof state. We apply a Monte Carlo computational physics technique to the Local\nGroup (LG) of galaxies to determine an approximate location for a Dark Matter\nembedding condensed neutrino object(CNO). The calculation is based on the\nrotational properties of the only spiral galaxies within the LG: M31, M33 and\nthe Milky Way. CNOs could be the Dark Matter everyone is looking for and we\nestimate the CNO embedding the LG to have a mass 5.17x10^15 Mo and a radius\n1.316 Mpc, with the estimated value of m ~= 0.8 eV/c2. The up-coming KATRIN\nexperiment will either be the definitive result or eliminate condensed\nneutrinos as a Dark Matter candidate.\n", "  In this thesis, we investigate properties of the one-parameter $\\beta$- and\nthe three-parameter $\\gamma_i$-deformed descendents of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM\ntheory. We find additional multi-trace interactions that must be included in\nthe deformed theories to prevent persistent divergences in observables. For the\n$\\gamma_i$-deformation, we show in an explicit Feynman-diagrammatic calculation\nthat these interactions have running coupling constants which spoil the\nconformal invariance of the quantised theory, even in the 't Hooft limit. We\nshow that the running coupling constant in principle also affect the anomalous\ndimensions of composite operators by calculating the $K=L$ loop leading order\nwrapping corrections to the operators tr$\\bigl(\\phi_i^L)$. For the\n$\\beta$-deformation, we analyse the impact of multi-trace couplings on the\none-loop spectrum and determine the complete one-loop dilatation operator of\nthe conformal $\\beta$-deformation in the 't Hooft limit. Based on the\nfield-theoretic data from the $\\beta$- and $\\gamma_i$-deformation, we propose a\ntest to determine whether supersymmetry and/or exact conformal invariance are\nnecessary prerequisites of the quantum integrability found for $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSYM theory. We also generalise the P\\'{o}lya-theoretic approach to the thermal\none-loop partition function to be also applicable in the setting of the\n$\\beta$- and $\\gamma_i$-deformation. We find that the deconfinement\nphase-transition temperature in the deformed theories is the same as in the\nundeformed theory at one-loop level and we conjecture that it remains the same\neven non-perturbatively. Finally, we also provide many technical details\nconcerning Feynman-diagram techniques and present the tool FokkenFeynPackage\nwhich implements these rules into Mathematica.\n", "  This work defines density factor as the ratio of before ignition density to\nafter ignition density of the ignition mixture. This work provides an\nestimation method for explosive limits of various fuels under room temperature\nand pressure by showing that for a large universe of fuels, constant adiabatic\nflame temperature and density factor are appropriate approximations at the\nlower explosive limit while only a constant density factor might be an\nappropriate approximation at the upper explosive limit.\n  Thus the assumption of a constant adiabatic flame temperature can be used in\ncalculating lower explosive limit while the assumption of a constant density\nfactor can be used in approximating upper explosive limit.\n", "  The distribution of waiting times between successive tunneling events is an\nalready established method to characterize current fluctuations in mesoscopic\nsystems. Here, I investigate mechanisms generating correlations between\nsubsequent waiting times in two model systems, a pair of capacitively coupled\nquantum dots and a single-level dot attached to spin-polarized leads. Waiting\ntime correlations are shown to give an insight into the internal dynamics of\nthe system, for example they allow distinction between different mechanisms of\nthe noise enhancement. Moreover, the presence of correlations breaks the\nvalidity of the renewal theory. This increases the number of independent\ncumulants of current fluctuation statistics, thus providing additional sources\nof information about the transport mechanism. I also propose a method for\ninferring the presence of waiting time correlations based on low-order current\ncorrelation functions. This method gives a way to extend the analysis of\nnonrenewal current fluctuations to the systems for which single-electron\ncounting is not experimentally feasible. The experimental relevance of the\nfindings is also discussed, for example reanalysis of previous results\nconcerning transport in quantum dots is suggested.\n", "  We observed Jupiter at wavelengths near 2 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array in February 2015. These frequencies are mostly sensitive to\nvariations in ammonia abundance and probe between ~0.5-2.0 bars of pressure in\nJupiter's atmosphere; within and below the visible cloud deck which has its\nbase near 0.7 bars. The resultant observed data were projected into a\ncylindrical map of the planet with spatial resolution of ~1500 km at the\nequator. We have examined the data for atmospheric waves and observed a\nprominent bright belt of radio hotspot features near 10N, likely connected to\nthe same equatorial wave associated with the 5-micron hotspots. We conducted a\npassive tracer power spectral wave analysis for the entire map. The power\nspectra analysis revealed that the atmosphere sampled in our observation\n(excluding the NEB region) is in a 2-D turbulent regime and its dynamics are\npredominately governed by the shallow water equations. The GRS is also very\nprominent and has a noticeable meridional asymmetry and we compare it, and\nnearby storms, with optical images. We find that the meridional radio profile\nhas a global north-south hemisphere distinction and find correlations of it to\noptical intensity banding and to shear zones of the zonal wind profile over\nselect regions of latitude. Amateur optical images taken before and after our\nobservation complemented the radio wavelength map to investigate dynamics of\nthe equatorial region in Jupiter's atmosphere. We find that two radio hotspots\nat 2 cm are well correlated with optical plumes in the NEB, additionally\nrevealing they are not the same 5 micron hotspot features correlated with\noptical dark patches between adjacent plumes. This analysis exploits the VLA's\nupgraded sensitivity and explores the opportunities now possible when studying\ngas giants, especially atmospheric dynamics of layers beneath upper level\nclouds.\n", "  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is one of the four satellites\nwithin Strategic Pioneer Research Program in Space Science of the Chinese\nAcademy of Science (CAS). DAMPE can detect electrons, photons and ions in a\nwide energy range (5 GeV to 10 TeV) and ions up to iron (100GeV to 100 TeV).\nPlastic Scintillator Detector (PSD) is one of the four payloads in DAMPE,\nproviding e/{\\gamma} separation and charge identification up to Iron. An ion\nbeam test was carried out for the Qualification Model of PSD in CERN with\n40GeV/u Argon primary beams. The Birk's saturation and charge resolution of PSD\nwere investigated.\n", "  Recent results on supercomputers show that beyond 65K cores, the efficiency\nof molecular dynamics simulations of interfacial systems decreases\nsignificantly. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic cutoff method (DCM) for\ninterfacial systems of arbitrarily large size. The idea consists in adopting a\ncutoff-based method in which the cutoff is cho- sen on a particle-by-particle\nbasis, according to the distance from the interface. Computationally, the\nchallenge is shifted from the long-range solvers to the detection of the\ninterfaces and to the computation of the particle-interface distances. For\nthese tasks, we present linear-time algorithms that do not rely on global\ncommunication patterns. As a result, the DCM algorithm is suited for large\nsystems of particles and mas- sively parallel computers. To demonstrate its\npotential, we integrated DCM into the LAMMPS open-source molecular dynamics\npackage, and simulated large liquid/vapor systems on two supercomputers:\nSuperMuc and JUQUEEN. In all cases, the accuracy of DCM is comparable to the\ntraditional particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) algorithm, while the\nperformance is considerably superior for large numbers of particles. For\nJUQUEEN, we provide timings for simulations running on the full system (458,\n752 cores), and show nearly perfect strong and weak scaling.\n", "  We study theoretically the bio-sensing capabilities of metal nanowire surface\nplasmons. As a specific example, we couple the nanowire to specific sites\n(bacteriochlorophyll) of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) photosynthetic pigment\nprotein complex. In this hybrid system, we find that when certain sites of the\nFMO complex are subject to either the suppression of inter-site transitions or\nare entirely disconnected from the complex, the resulting variations in the\nexcitation transfer rates through the complex can be monitored through the\ncorresponding changes in the scattering spectra of the incident nanowire\nsurface plasmons. We also find that these changes can be further enhanced by\nchanging the ratio of plasmon-site couplings. The change of the Fano lineshape\nin the scattering spectra further reveals that \"site 5\" in the FMO complex\nplays a distinct role from other sites. Our results provide a feasible way,\nusing single photons, to detect mutation-induced, or bleaching-induced, local\ndefects or modifications of the FMO complex, and allows access to both the\nlocal and global properties of the excitation transfer in such systems.\n", "  The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne, soft-gamma ray\nimager, spectrometer, and polarimeter with sensitivity from 0.2 to 5 MeV.\nUtilizing a compact Compton telescope design with twelve cross-strip,\nhigh-purity germanium detectors, COSI has three main science goals: study the\n511 keV positron annihilation line from the Galactic plane, image diffuse\nemission from stellar nuclear lines, and perform polarization studies of\ngamma-ray bursts and other extreme astrophysical environments. COSI has just\ncompleted a successful 46-day flight on NASA's new Super Pressure Balloon,\nlaunched from Wanaka, New Zealand, in May 2016. We present an overview of the\ninstrument and the 2016 flight, and discuss COSI's main science goals,\npredicted performance, and preliminary results.\n", "  The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne gamma-ray\n(0.2-5 MeV) telescope with inherent sensitivity to polarization. COSI's main\ngoal is to study astrophysical sources such as $\\gamma$-ray bursts, positron\nannihilation, Galactic nucleosynthesis, and compact objects. COSI employs a\ncompact Compton telescope design utilizing 12 high-purity cross strip germanium\ndetectors (size: $8\\times8\\times1.5$ cm$^3$, 2 mm strip pitch).\n  We require well-benchmarked simulations to simulate the full instrument\nresponse used for data analysis, to optimize our analysis algorithms, and to\nbetter understand our instrument and the in-flight performance. In order to\nachieve a reasonable agreement, we have built a comprehensive mass model of the\ninstrument and developed a detailed detector effects engine, which takes into\naccount the individual performance of each strip as well as the characteristics\nof the overall detector system. We performed detailed Monte-Carlo simulations\nwith Cosima/Geant4, applied the detector effects engine, and benchmarked the\nresults with pre-flight calibrations using radioactive sources. After applying\nthe detector effects engine, the simulations closely resemble the measurements,\nand the standard calibration, event reconstruction, and imaging pipeline used\nfor measurements can also be applied to the simulations.\n  In this manuscript, we will describe the detector effects engine, the\nbenchmarking tests with calibrations, and the application to preliminary\nresults from COSI's 46-day balloon flight in 2016.\n", "  The systematic study of fission fragment yields under different initial\nconditions provides a valuable experimental benchmark for fission models that\naim to understand this complex decay channel and to predict reaction product\nyields. Inverse kinematics coupled to the use of a high-resolution spectrometer\nis shown to be a powerful tool to identify and measure the inclusive isotopic\nyields of fission fragments. In-flight fusion fission was used to produce\nsecondary beams of neutron-rich isotopes in the collision of a 238U beam at 24\nMeV/u with 9Be and 12C targets at GANIL using the LISE3 fragment-separator.\nUnique A,Z,q identification of fission products was attained with the\ndE-TKE-Brho-ToF measurement technique. Mass, and atomic number distributions\nare reported for the two reactions that show the importance of different\nreaction mechanisms for these two targets.\n", "  The two-dimensional $\\sigma$-model with the de Sitter target space has a\nlocal canonical description in the north pole diamond of the Penrose diagram in\nthe cosmological gauge. The left and right moving modes on the embedded base\nspace with the topology of a cylinder are entangled among themselves and\ninteract with the time-dependent components of the metric of the de Sitter\nspace. Firstly we address the issue of the existence of the untangled\noscillator representation and the description of the nonequilibrium dynamics of\nthe untangled modes. We show that the untangled oscillators can be obtained\nfrom the entangled operators by applying a set of Bogoliubov transformations\nthat satisfy a set of constraints that result from the requirement that the\npartial evolution generator be diagonal. Secondly, we determine the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of the untangled modes in the Non-Equilibrium Thermo\nField Dynamics formalism. In this setting, the thermal modes are represented as\nthermal doublet oscillators that satisfy partial evolution equations of\nHeisenberg-type. We use these equations to compute the local free one-body\npropagator of an arbitrary mode between two times. Thirdly, we discuss the\nfield representation of the thermal modes. We show that there is a set of\nthermal doublet fields that satisfy the equal time canonical commutation\nrelations, are solutions to the $\\sigma$-model equations of motion and can be\ndecomposed in terms of thermal doublet oscillators. Finally, we construct a\nlocal partial evolution functional of Hamilton-like form for the thermal\ndoublet fields.\n", "  We illustrate the adiabatic quantum computing solution of the knapsack\nproblem with both integer profits and weights. For problems with $n$ objects\n(or items) and integer capacity $c$, we give specific examples using both an\nIsing class problem Hamiltonian requiring $n+c$ qubits and a much more\nefficient one using $n+[\\log_2 c]+1$ qubits. The discussion includes a brief\nmention of classical algorithms for knapsack, applications of this commonly\noccurring problem, and the relevance of further studies both theoretically and\nnumerically of the behavior of the energy gap. Included too is a demonstration\nand commentary on a version of quantum search using a certain Ising model.\nFurthermore, an Appendix presents analytic results concerning the boundary for\nthe easy-versus-hard problem-instance phase transition for the special case\nsubset sum problem.\n", "  This work focuses on the dynamics and the detection methods of co-orbital\nexoplanets. We call \"co-orbital\" any configuration in which two planets orbit\nwith the same mean mean-motion around the same star. First, we revisit the\nresults of the circular coplanar case. We also recall that the manifold\nassociated to the coplanar case and the manifold corresponding to the circular\ncase are both invariant by the flow of the averaged Hamiltonian. We hence study\nthese two particular cases. We focus mainly on the coplanar case (eccentric),\nwhere we study the evolution of families of non-maximal quasi-periodic orbits\nparametrized by the eccentricity of the planets. We show that the geometry of\nthese families is highly dependent on the eccentricity, which causes\nsignificant topology changes across the space of phases as the latter\nincreases. A chapter is dedicated to the detection of co-orbital exoplanets. We\nrecall the different detection methods adapted to the co-orbital case. We focus\non the radial velocity technique, and the combination of radial velocity and\ntransit measurements. Finally, we describe a method to study the effect of\norbital perturbations on the spin-orbit resonances for a rigid body. We apply\nthis method in two cases: the eccentric co-orbital case and the circumbinary\ncase.\n", "  We present analytical and numerical studies of models of supernova-remnant\n(SNR) blast waves expanding into uniform media and interacting with a denser\ncavity wall, in one spatial dimension. We predict the nonthermal emission from\nsuch blast waves: synchrotron emission at radio and X-ray energies, and\nbremsstrahlung, inverse-Compton emission (from cosmic-microwave-background seed\nphotons, ICCMB), and emission from the decay of $\\pi^0$ mesons produced in\ninelastic collisions between accelerated ions and thermal gas, at GeV and TeV\nenergies. Accelerated particle spectra are assumed to be power-laws with\nexponential cutoffs at energies limited by the remnant age or (for electrons,\nif lower) by radiative losses. We compare the results with those from\nhomogeneous (\"one-zone\") models. Such models give fair representations of the\n1-D results for uniform media, but cavity-wall interactions produce effects for\nwhich one-zone models are inadequate. We study the time evolution of SNR\nmorphology and emission with time. Strong morphological differences exist\nbetween ICCMB and $\\pi^0$-decay emission, at some stages, the TeV emission can\nbe dominated by the former and the GeV by the latter, resulting in strong\nenergy-dependence of morphology. Integrated gamma-ray spectra show apparent\npower-laws of slopes that vary with time, but do not indicate the energy\ndistribution of a single population of particles. As observational capabilities\nat GeV and TeV energies improve, spatial inhomogeneity in SNRs will need to be\naccounted for.\n", "  We present detailed measurements of the redshift path density, equivalent\nwidth distribution, column density distribution, and redshift evolution of\n${\\MgII}$ absorbers as measured in archival spectra from the UVES spectrograph\nat the Very Large Telescope (VLT/UVES) and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck\nTelescope (Keck/HIRES) to equivalent width detection limits below $0.01$~{\\AA}.\nThis survey examines 432 VLT/UVES spectra from the UVES SQUAD collaboration and\n170 Keck/HIRES spectra from the KODIAQ group, allowing for detections of\nintervening ${\\MgII}$ absorbers spanning redshifts $0.1 < z < 2.6$. We employ\nan accurate, automated approach to line detection which consistently detects\nredshifted absorption lines. We measure the equivalent widths, apparent optical\ndepth column densities, and velocity widths for each absorbing system. Using\nour complete sample of all detectable ${\\MgII}$ absorbers, we can accurately\ndetermine the redshift path density of absorbers across cosmic time. We measure\nevolution in the comoving ${\\MgII}$ line density, $dN\\,/dX$, finding more high\nequivalent width absorbers at $z = 2$ than at present. We also measure\nevolution in the equivalent width distribution, parameterized by a Schechter\nfunction fit, finding a shallower weak-end slope for absorbers at redshifts\nbetween $1.53 < z < 2.64$ as compared to lower redshifts. Finally, we calculate\nthe cosmic mass fraction of ${\\MgII}$ using the column density distribution. We\nfind that weak ${\\MgII}$ absorbers, those with equivalent widths less than\n$0.3$~{\\AA}, are physically distinct and evolve separately from very strong\n${\\MgII}$ absorbers, which have equivalent widths greater than $1.0$~{\\AA}.\n", "  With the large-scale penetration of the internet, for the first time,\nhumanity has become linked by a single, open, communications platform.\nHarnessing this fact, we report insights arising from a unified internet\nactivity and location dataset of an unparalleled scope and accuracy drawn from\nover a trillion (1.5$\\times 10^{12}$) observations of end-user internet\nconnections, with temporal resolution of just 15min over 2006-2012. We first\napply this dataset to the expansion of the internet itself over 1,647 urban\nagglomerations globally. We find that unique IP per capita counts reach\nsaturation at approximately one IP per three people, and take, on average, 16.1\nyears to achieve; eclipsing the estimated 100- and 60- year saturation times\nfor steam-power and electrification respectively. Next, we use intra-diurnal\ninternet activity features to up-scale traditional over-night sleep\nobservations, producing the first global estimate of over-night sleep duration\nin 645 cities over 7 years. We find statistically significant variation between\ncontinental, national and regional sleep durations including some evidence of\nglobal sleep duration convergence. Finally, we estimate the relationship\nbetween internet concentration and economic outcomes in 411 OECD regions and\nfind that the internet's expansion is associated with negative or positive\nproductivity gains, depending strongly on sectoral considerations. To our\nknowledge, our study is the first of its kind to use online/offline activity of\nthe entire internet to infer social science insights, demonstrating the\nunparalleled potential of the internet as a social data-science platform.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to bring together the notions of quantum game and\ngame isomorphism. The work is intended as an attempt to introduce a new\ncriterion for quantum game schemes. The generally accepted requirement forces a\nquantum scheme to generate the classical game in a particular case. Now, given\na quantum game scheme and two isomorphic classical games, we additionally\nrequire the resulting quantum games to be isomorphic as well. We are concerned\nwith the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein quantum game scheme and the strong\nisomorphism between games in strategic form.\n", "  Consecutive measurements performed on the same quantum system can reveal\nfundamental insights into quantum theory's causal structure, and probe\ndifferent aspects of the quantum measurement problem. According to the\nCopenhagen interpretation, measurements affect the quantum system in such a way\nthat the quantum superposition collapses after the measurement, erasing any\nknowledge of the prior state. We show here that counter to this view,\nunamplified measurements (measurements where all variables comprising a pointer\nare controllable) have coherent ancilla density matrices that encode the memory\nof the entire set of quantum measurements, and that the quantum chain of a set\nof consecutive unamplified measurements is non-Markovian. In contrast,\nsequences of amplified measurements (measurements where at least one pointer\nvariable has been lost) are equivalent to a quantum Markov chain. An analysis\nof arbitrary non-Markovian quantum chains of measurements reveals that all of\nthe information necessary to reconstruct the chain is encoded on its boundary\n(the state preparation and the final measurement), reminiscent of the\nholographic principle.\n", "  Virtual Observatory (VO) is a data-intensively online astronomical research\nand education environment, which takes advantages of advanced information\ntechnologies to achieve seamless and global access to astronomical information.\nAstroCloud is a cyber-infrastructure for astronomy research initiated by\nChinese Virtual Observatory (China-VO) project, and also a kind of physical\ndistributed platform which integrates lots of tasks such as telescope access\nproposal management, data archiving, data quality control, data release and\nopen access, cloud based data processing and analysis. It consists of five\napplication channels, i.e. observation, data, tools, cloud and public and is\nacting as a full lifecycle management system and gateway for astronomical data\nand telescopes. Physically, the platform is hosted in six cities currently,\ni.e. Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, Lijiang and Urumqi, and serving more\nthan 17 thousand users. Achievements from international Virtual Observatories\nand Cloud Computing are adopted heavily. In the paper, backgrounds of the\nproject, architecture, Cloud Computing environment, key features of the system,\ncurrent status and future plans are introduced.\n", "  Precise estimates of the nucleon charges $g_A$, $g_S$ and $g_T$ are needed in\nmany phenomenological analyses of SM and BSM physics. In this talk, we present\nresults from two sets of calculations using clover fermions on 9 ensembles of\n2+1+1-flavor HISQ and 4 ensembles of 2+1-flavor clover lattices. We show that\nhigh statistics can be obtained cost-effectively using the truncated solver\nmethod with bias correction and the coherent source sequential propagator\ntechnique. By performing simulations at 4--5 values of the source-sink\nseparation $t_{\\rm sep}$, we demonstrate control over excited-state\ncontamination using 2- and 3-state fits. Using the high-precision 2+1+1-flavor\ndata, we perform a simultaneous fit in $a$, $M_\\pi$ and $M_\\pi L$ to obtain our\nfinal results for the charges.\n", "  Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are presented for a coarse-grained\nbead-spring model of ring polymer brushes under compression. Flexible polymer\nbrushes are always disordered during compression, whereas semiflexible brushes\ntend to be ordered under sufficiently strong compression. Besides, the polymer\nmonomer density of semiflexible polymer brush is very high near the polymer\nbrush surface, inducing a peak value of free energy near the polymer brush\nsurface. Therefore, by compressing nanoparticles (NPs) in semiflexible ring\nbrush system, NPs tend to exhibit a closely packed single layer structure\nbetween the brush surface and the impenetrable wall, which provide a new access\nof designing responsive applications.\n", "  We consider the first-order phase transition of a charged anti-de Sitter\nblack hole, and find that the equation of state with the conditions of the two\ncoexisting phases, leads to the two coupled equations about the thermodynamic\nvolumes of small black hole and large black hole. By solving the equations, it\nis found that each reduced volume is only a function of the parameter $\\omega$\n. All properties of the coexistence curve can be studied from the two volume\nfunctions. In particular, each thermodynamic quantity is described by a\npiecewise analytic function. The demarcation point is located at\n$\\omega_{d}=12(2\\sqrt{3}-3)$. The thermodynamic function but not its\nderivative, is continuous at the point. This property is completely different\nfrom that of the ven der Waals fluid. Moreover, the thermodynamic behaviors as\n$\\omega\\rightarrow0$ are discussed. From which one can easily obtain some\ncritical exponents and amplitudes for small-large black hole phase transitions.\n", "  Chimera states have been studied in 1D arrays, and a variety of different\nchimera states have been found using different models. Research has recently\nbeen extended to 2D arrays but only to phase models of them. Here, we extend it\nto a nonphase model of 2D arrays of neurons and focus on the influence of\nnonlocal coupling. Using extensive numerical simulations, we find,\nsurprisingly, that this system can show most types of previously observed\nchimera states, in contrast to previous models, where only one or a few types\nof chimera states can be observed in each model. We also find that this model\ncan show some special chimera-like patterns such as gridding and multicolumn\npatterns, which were previously observed only in phase models. Further, we\npresent an effective approach, i.e., removing some of the coupling links, to\ngenerate heterogeneous coupling, which results in diverse chimera-like patterns\nand even induces transformations from one chimera-like pattern to another.\n", "  In this work we adopted a CLEAN-based method to determine the scatter time,\n$\\tau$, from archived pulsar profiles under both the thin screen and uniform\nmedium scattering models and to calculate the scatter time frequency scale\nindex $\\alpha$ where $\\tau\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$. The value of $\\alpha$ is\n$-4.4$, if a Kolmogorov spectrum of the interstellar medium turbulence is\nassumed. We deconvolved 1342 profiles from 347 pulsars over a broad range of\nfrequencies and dispersion measures. In our survey, in the majority of cases\nthe scattering effect was not significant compared to pulse profile widths. For\na subset of 21 pulsars scattering at the lowest frequencies was large enough to\nbe measured. Because reliable scatter time measurements were determined only\nfor the lowest frequency, we were limited to using upper limits on scatter\ntimes at higher frequencies for the purpose of our scatter time frequency slope\nestimation. We scaled the deconvolved scatter time to 1~GHz assuming\n$\\alpha=-4.4$ and considered our results in the context of other observations\nwhich yielded a broad relation between scatter time and dispersion measure.\n", "  We study the limits of the spatial and velocity resolution of radio\ninterferometry to infer the mass of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in\ngalactic centres using the kinematics of circum-nuclear molecular gas, by\nconsidering the shapes of the galaxy surface brightness profile,\nsignal-to-noise ratios (S/Ns) of the position-velocity diagram (PVD) and\nsystematic errors due to the spatial and velocity structure of the molecular\ngas. We argue that for fixed galaxy stellar mass and SMBH mass, the spatial and\nvelocity scale that need to be resolved increase and decrease, respectively,\nwith decreasing \\sersic\\ index of the galaxy surface brightness profile. We\nvalidate our arguments using simulated PVDs for varying beam size and velocity\nchannel width. Furthermore, we consider the systematic effects on the inference\nof the SMBH mass by simulating PVDs including the spatial and velocity\nstructure of the molecular gas, which demonstrates that their impacts are not\nsignificant for a PVD with good S/N unless the spatial and velocity scale\nassociated with the systematic effects are comparable to or larger than the\nangular resolution and velocity channel width of the PVD from pure circular\nmotion. Also, we caution that a bias in a galaxy surface brightness profile\nowing to the poor resolution of a galaxy photometric image can largely bias the\nSMBH mass by an order of magnitude. This study shows the promise and the limit\nof ALMA observations for measuring SMBH mass using molecular gas kinematics and\nprovides a useful technical justification for an ALMA proposal with the science\ngoal of measuring SMBH mass.\n", "  Electromagnetic rays travel on curved paths under the influence of gravity.\nWhen a dispersive optical medium is included, these trajectories are\nfrequency-dependent. In this work we consider the behaviour of rays when a\nspherically symmetric, luminous compact object described by the Schwarzschild\nmetric is surrounded by an optically thin shell of plasma supported by\nradiation pressure. Such levitating atmospheres occupy a position of stable\nradial equilibrium, where radiative flux and gravitational effects are\nbalanced. Using general relativity and an inhomogeneous plasma we find the\nexistence of a stable circular orbit within the atmospheric shell for\nlow-frequency rays. We explore families of bound orbits that exist between the\nshell and the compact object, and identify sets of novel periodic orbits.\nFinally, we examine conditions necessary for the trapping and escape of\nlow-frequency radiation.\n", "  The method of evaluation outlined in a previous work has been utilized here\nto evaluate certain other three- electron and four- electron atomic integrals\ninvolving s Slater-type orbitals and exponential correlation with unlinked\n$r_{ij}$'s. Limiting expressions for various such integrals have been derived,\nwhich has not been done earlier. Closed-form expressions for $<r_{12} r_{13} /\nr_{14}>$, $<r_{12}r_{34}/r_{23}>$, $<r_{12}r_{23}/r_{34}>$,\n$<r_{12}r_{13}/r_{34}>$ and $<r_{12}r_{34}/r_{13}>$ have been obtained.\n", "  The MAGIC TeV gamma-ray telescopes have devoted several hundreds hour of\nobservation time in about a decade, to hunt for particle dark matter indirect\nsignatures in gamma rays, from various candidate targets of interest in the\nsky: the galactic center, satellite galaxies, galaxy clusters and unidentified\nobjects in other bands. Despite the effort, no hints are present in MAGIC data.\nThese observation are nevertheless not unusable. MAGIC indeed derived the most\nrobust upper limits in the TeV range than any other instrument. These results,\nfor the time being, only mildly constrain some classic dark matter models, but\nare of use in the construction of dark matter models for the next searches,\nthat consider also the negative results from accelerator and direct-detection\nexperiments. In the contribution, we discuss and review MAGIC results, putting\nthem into context, and in perspective with the next generation of ground-based\nCherenkov telescopes. We will briefly inform about future MAGIC projects\nregarding dark matter searches.\n", "  Lasers that generate ultra-intense light pulses are under development for\nexperiments in high-field and high-energy-density physics, as well as for\napplications such as particle acceleration. Extensions to even higher powers\nare being considered for future investigations that can only be imagined today,\nsuch as the quantum electrodynamics of plasmas and isolated attosecond-pulse\ngeneration with solid targets. For all of these areas, it is vital to produce\nhigh-contrast pulses, so that no pre-plasma is created in the target before the\narrival of the main pulse. However, noise is unavoidable in high-gain\namplification, and is manifested in the form of background light that\naccompanies pulses generated by chirped-pulse amplification (CPA). Here, we\nintroduce a linear filtering technique based on spatio-spectral coupling, which\nallows in-band filtering of amplified pulses for the first time. Experiments\ndemonstrate approximately 40 times contrast enhancement in optical parametric\nchirped-pulse amplification (OPCPA) and provide a foundation for scaling to\nmuch higher performance. The simplicity, efficiency, and direct compatibility\nwith existing techniques for short-pulse generation will make spatio-spectral\nfiltering attractive to a wide range of applications in ultrafast optics and\ntime-resolved spectroscopy, and may open new directions in noise reduction.\n", "  The construction of large-scale quantum networks relies on the development of\npractical quantum repeaters. Many approaches have been proposed with the goal\nof outperforming the direct transmission of photons, but most of them are\ninefficient or difficult to implement with current technology. Here, we present\na protocol that uses a semi-hierarchical structure to improve the entanglement\ndistribution rate while reducing the requirement of memory time to a range of\ntens of milliseconds. This protocol can be implemented with a fixed distance of\nelementary links and fixed requirements on quantum memories, which are\nindependent of the total distance. This configuration is especially suitable\nfor scalable applications in large-scale quantum networks.\n", "  In this contribution, we summarize the progress made in the investigation of\nbinary candidates with an RR Lyrae component in 2016. We also discuss the\nactual status of the RRLyrBinCan database.\n", "  Of all the light elements, lithium is the most sensitive indicator of stellar\nevolution. This review discusses current data on the abundance of lithium in\nthe atmospheres of A-, F-, G-, and K-stars of different types, as well as the\nconsistency of these data with theoretical predictions. The variety of observed\nLi abundances is illustrated by the following objects in different stages of\nevolution: 1) Old stars in the galactic halo, which have a lithium abundance\nlog e(Li)=2.2 (the \"lithium plateau\") that appears to be 0.5 dex lower than the\nprimordial abundance predicted by cosmological models. 2) Young stars in the\ngalactic disk, which have been used to estimate the contemporary initial\nlithium abundance log e(Li)=3.2 +/- 0.1 for stars in the Main sequence.\nPossible sources of lithium enrichment in the interstellar medium during\nevolution of the galaxy are discussed. 3) Evolving FGK dwarfs in the galactic\ndisk, which have lower log e(Li) for lower effective temperature Teff and mass\nM. The \"lithium dip\" near Teff~6600 K in the distribution of log e(Li) with\nrespect to Teff in old clusters is discussed. 4) FGK giants and supergiants, of\nwhich most have no lithium at all. This phenomenon is consistent with rotating\nstar model calculations. 5) Lithium rich cold giants with log e(Li) > 2.0 ,\nwhich form a small, enigmatic group. Theoretical models with rotation can\nexplain the existence of these stars only in the case of low initial rotation\nvelocities V0 < 50 km/s. In all other cases it is necessary to assume recent\nsynthesis of lithium (capture of a giant planet is an alternative). 6) Magnetic\nAp-stars, where lithium is concentrated in spots located at the magnetic poles.\nThere the lithium abundance reaches log e(Li)=6. Discrepancies between\nobservations and theory are noted for almost all the stars discussed in this\nreview.\n", "  We investigate the properties of vacuum decay taking into account a\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity. We extend the standard thin-wall solution to\ninclude the non-minimal coupling and verify its validity by comparison with a\nfull numerical study. We also investigate the implications of a~large\ncosmological constant whose influence on the geometry boosts the tunneling\nrate. Our analysis shows that the influence of the non-minimal coupling differs\nsignificantly between the cases of Minkowski and deSitter backgrounds.\n", "  The Gutzwiller wave function solution of the $t$-$J$-$U$ model is considered\nfor the bilayer high-T$_C$ superconductor by using the so-called diagrammatic\nexpansion method. The focus is on the influence of the interlayer effects on\nthe superconducting state. The chosen pairing symmetry is a mixture of\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry within the layers and the so-called $s^{\\pm}$ symmetry\nfor the interlayer contribution. The analyzed interlayer terms reflect the\ninterlayer electron hopping, the interlayer exchange coupling, and the\ninterlayer pair hopping. The obtained results are compared with selected\nexperimental data corresponding to the copper-based compound Bi-2212 with two\nCu-O planes in the unit cell. For the sake of comparison, selected results for\nthe case of the bilayer Hubbard model are also provided. This paper complements\nour recent results obtained for the single-plane high temperature cuprates [cf.\nJ. Spa{\\l}ek, M. Zegrodnik, and J. Kaczmarczyk, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 95}, 024506\n(2017)]\n", "  Microscopy and optical imaging are drastically limited by the inhomogeneities\nencountered by the light while propagating from the object of interest to the\ndetection system. In this context, adaptive optics and wavefront manipulation\nare able to improve the contrast (visibility) of systems embedded in turbid and\nnoisy environments. By wavefront shaping, the fluence of the light propagating\nthrough complex systems can be controlled, thus, confining the light in a\ndefined microscopic region in the volume or at the back of scattering\nstructures. We can imagine to counterintuitively exploit the optical barriers,\nturning them into scattering lenses. In this Thesis we consider these new\ngeneration of lenses: we demonstrate them to be configurable optical devices\nable to produce tailored light structures, hence resulting extremely\nadvantageous if integrated in optical systems.\n", "  Spontaneous emission of the quantum system driven by a high intensity\nclassical laser field is analyzed. The study is based on the accurate\nconsideration of quantum system interaction with vacuum quantized field modes\nin the first order of perturbation theory, while the intense laser field is\nconsidered classically beyond the perturbation theory. It is demonstrated that\nthe spectrum of the spontaneous emission can be used for analyzing of the\nstrong-field dynamics and structure of the energy spectrum of the atomic\nsystem. The obtained data are compared with that obtained in the frames of\nsemiclassical approximation typically used for analyzing of the strong-field\ndynamics. It is found that the applicability of the semiclassical approach is\nstrictly limited.\n", "  We show that the solutions obtained in the paper `An exact solution for\narbitrarily rotating gaseous polytropes with index unity' by Kong, Zhang, and\nSchubert represent only approximate solutions of the free-boundary\nEuler-Poisson system of equations describing uniformly rotating,\nself-gravitating polytropes with index unity. We discuss the quality of such\nsolutions as approximations to the rigidly rotating equilibrium polytropic\nconfigurations.\n", "  In the well known logistic map, the parameter of interest is weighted by a\ncoefficient that decreases linearly when this parameter increases. Since such a\nlinear decrease forms a specific case, we consider the more general case where\nthis coefficient decreases nonlinearly as in a hyperbolic tangent relaxation of\na system toward equilibrium. We show that, in this latter case, the asymptotic\nvalues obtained via iteration of the logistic map are considerably modified. We\ndemonstrate that both the steepness of the nonlinear decrease as well as its\nupper and lower boundaries significantly alter the bifurcation diagram. New\nperiod doubling features and transitions to chaos appear, possibly leading to\nregimes with small periods. Computations with a variety of parameter values\nshow that the logistic map can be significantly reordered in the case of a\nnonlinear growth rate.\n", "  We investigate the individual activity coefficients of ions in LaCl$_{3}$\nusing our theory that is based on the competition of ion-ion (II) and ion-water\n(IW) interactions (Vincze et al., J. Chem. Phys. 133, 154507, 2010). The II\nterm is computed from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of\nthe implicit solvent model of electrolytes using hard sphere ions with Pauling\nradii. The IW term is computed on the basis of Born's treatment of solvation\nusing experimental hydration free energies. This agreement is remarkable\nconsidering the facts that (i) the result is the balance of two terms that are\nlarge in absolute value (up to $20 kT$) but opposite in sign, and (ii) that our\nmodel does not contain any adjustable parameter. All the parameters used in the\nmodel are taken from experiments: concentration dependent dielectric constant,\nhydration free energies, Pauling radii.\n", "  A diurnal varying haze layer at the bright spots of Occator on dwarf planet\nCeres has been reported from images of the Dawn Framing Camera. This finding is\nsupported by ground-based observations revealing diurnal albedo changes at\nOccator's longitude. In the present work, we further investigate the previously\nreported haze phenomenon in more detail using additional Framing Camera images.\nWe demonstrate that the light scattering behavior at the central floor of\nOccator is different compared to a typical cerean surface and is likely\ninconsistent with a pure solid surface scatterer. The identified deviation is\nbest explained by an additional component to the scattered light of the\nsurface, i.e., a haze layer. Our results support the water vapor detection by\nHerschel observations though the existence of a tenuous cerean exosphere is not\nyet confirmed.\n", "  Nanoporous graphitic carbon membranes with defined chemical composition and\npore architecture are novel nanomaterials that are actively pursued. Compared\nto easy-to-make porous carbon powders that dominate the porous carbon research\nand applications in energy generation/conversion and environmental remediation,\nporous carbon membranes are synthetically more challenging though rather\nappealing from an application perspective due to their structural integrity,\ninterconnectivity and purity. Here we report a simple bottom-up approach to\nfabricate large-size, freestanding, porous carbon membranes that feature an\nunusual single-crystal-like graphitic order and hierarchical pore architecture\nplus favorable nitrogen doping. When loaded with cobalt nanoparticles, such\ncarbon membranes serve as high-performance carbon-based non-noble metal\nelectrocatalyst for overall water splitting.\n", "  The visible reflectance spectrum of many solar system bodies changes with\nchanging viewing geometry for reasons not fully understood. It is often\nobserved to redden (increasing spectral slope) with increasing solar phase\nangle, an effect known as phase reddening. Only once, in an observation of the\nMartian surface by the Viking 1 lander, was reddening observed up to a certain\nphase angle with bluing beyond, making the reflectance ratio as a function of\nphase angle shaped like an arch. However, in laboratory experiments this\narch-shape is frequently encountered. To investigate this, we measured the\nbidirectional reflectance of particulate samples of several common rock types\nin the 400-1000 nm wavelength range and performed ray-tracing simulations. We\nconfirm the occurrence of the arch for surfaces that are forward scattering,\ni.e. are composed of semi-transparent particles and are smooth on the scale of\nthe particles, and for which the reflectance increases from the lower to the\nhigher wavelength in the reflectance ratio. The arch shape is reproduced by the\nsimulations, which assume a smooth surface. However, surface roughness on the\nscale of the particles, such as the Hapke and van Horn (1963) fairy castles\nthat can spontaneously form when sprinkling a fine powder, leads to monotonic\nreddening. A further consequence of this form of microscopic roughness (being\nindistinct without the use of a microscope) is a flattening of the disk\nfunction at visible wavelengths, i.e. Lommel-Seeliger-type scattering. The\nexperiments further reveal monotonic reddening for reflectance ratios at\nnear-IR wavelengths. The simulations fail to reproduce this particular\nreddening, and we suspect that it results from roughness on the surface of the\nparticles. Given that the regolith of atmosphereless solar system bodies is\ncomposed of small particles, our results indicate that the prevalence of\nmonotonic (...)\n", "  We consider the estimation of a signal from the knowledge of its noisy linear\nrandom Gaussian projections. A few examples where this problem is relevant are\ncompressed sensing, sparse superposition codes, and code division multiple\naccess. There has been a number of works considering the mutual information for\nthis problem using the replica method from statistical physics. Here we put\nthese considerations on a firm rigorous basis. First, we show, using a\nGuerra-Toninelli type interpolation, that the replica formula yields an upper\nbound to the exact mutual information. Secondly, for many relevant practical\ncases, we present a converse lower bound via a method that uses spatial\ncoupling, state evolution analysis and the I-MMSE theorem. This yields a single\nletter formula for the mutual information and the minimal-mean-square error for\nrandom Gaussian linear estimation of all discrete bounded signals. In addition,\nwe prove that the low complexity approximate message-passing algorithm is\noptimal outside of the so-called hard phase, in the sense that it\nasymptotically reaches the minimal-mean-square error. In this work spatial\ncoupling is used primarily as a proof technique. However our results also prove\ntwo important features of spatially coupled noisy linear random Gaussian\nestimation. First there is no algorithmically hard phase. This means that for\nsuch systems approximate message-passing always reaches the minimal-mean-square\nerror. Secondly, in a proper limit the mutual information associated to such\nsystems is the same as the one of uncoupled linear random Gaussian estimation.\n", "  The heating effect of terahertz pulse with various frequencies and\nintensities on the heavy water solution is investigated using the molecular\ndynamics simulation. Resonant absorptions are found for both heavy water and\nlight water, but at a different resonant frequency which is about 16 THz for\nheavy water and 21 THz for light water. This resonant phenomenon can be\nexplained perfectly by the collective rotational modes that may release water\nmolecules from hydrogen bonding. The findings not only illustrate the heating\nmechanism of heavy water solution under the terahertz pulse irradiation, but\nalso demonstrate a novel difference between light water and heavy water that\ncould have potential applications.\n", "  Structural identification of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNT) is\npresented through a robust procedure based on the latest generation of\ntransmission electron microscope, making possible a statistical analysis based\non numerous nano-objects. This approach reveals that inner and outer tubes of\nDWNTs are not randomly oriented, suggesting the existence of a mechanical\ncoupling between the two concentric walls. With the support of atomic scale\nmodelisations, we attribute it to the presence of incommensurate domains whose\nstructures depend on the diameters and helicities of both tubes, and where\ninner tubes try to achieve a local stacking orientation to reduce strain\neffects.\n", "  The evidence is that the mass of the universe is dominated by an exotic\nnonbaryonic form of matter largely draped around the galaxies. It approximates\nan initially low pressure gas of particles that interact only with gravity, but\nwe know little more than that. Searches for detection thus must follow many\ndifficult paths to a great discovery, what the universe is made of. The\nnonbaryonic picture grew out of a convergence of evidence and ideas in the\nearly 1980s. Developments two decades later considerably improved the evidence,\nand advances since then have made the case for nonbaryonic dark matter\ncompelling.\n", "  The Hubble Space Telescope recently celebrated 25 years of operation. Some of\nthe first images of extragalactic optical jets were taken by HST in the\nmid-1990s; with time baselines on the order of 20 years and state-of-the-art\nastrometry techniques, we are now able to reach accuracies in proper-motion\nmeasurements on the order of a tenth of a milliarcsecond per year. We present\nthe results of a recent HST program to measure the kiloparsec-scale proper\nmotions of eleven nearby optical jets with Hubble, the first sample of its\nkind. When paired with VLBI proper-motion measurements on the parsec scale, we\nare now able to map the full velocity profile of these jets from near the black\nhole to the final deceleration as they extend out into and beyond the host\ngalaxy. We see convincing evidence that weak-flavor jets (i.e., FR Is) have a\nslowly increasing jet speed up to 100 pc from the core, where superluminal\ncomponents are first seen.\n", "  The KM3NeT/ARCA high energy neutrino telescope is currently under\nconstruction in the Mediterranean sea. The detector will consist of two blocks\nof instrumented structures and will have a size of the order of a\ncubic-kilometer. In this work the status of the detector, the expected\nperformance to galactic and extragalactic neutrino sources, the results from\nprototypes and the first deployed lines will be briefly reported.\n", "  This Topical Review presents an overview of the recent experimental results\non the quantitative determination of the magnetic exchange parameters in\nultrathin magnetic films and multilayers, grown on different substrates. The\nexperimental approaches to probe both the symmetric Heisenberg as well as the\nantisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya exchange interaction in ultrathin magnetic\nfilms and at interfaces are discussed in detail. It is explained how the\nexperimental spectrum of magnetic excitations can be used to quantify the\nstrength of these interactions.\n", "  The influence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the spin-wave\ndispersion in an Fe double layer grown on W(110) is measured for the first\ntime. It is demonstrated that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction breaks the\ndegeneracy of spin waves and leads to an asymmetric spin-wave dispersion\nrelation. An extended Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian is employed to obtain the\nlongitudinal component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors from the\nexperimentally measured energy asymmetry.\n", "  We introduce an alternative to the method of matched asymptotic expansions.\nIn the \"traditional\" implementation, approximate solutions, valid in different\n(but overlapping) regions are matched by using \"intermediate\" variables. Here\nwe propose to match at the level of the equations involved, via a \"uniform\nexpansion\" whose equations enfold those of the approximations to be matched.\nThis has the advantage that one does not need to explicitly solve the\nasymptotic equations to do the matching, which can be quite impossible for some\nproblems. In addition, it allows matching to proceed in certain wave situations\nwhere the traditional approach fails because the time behaviors differ (e.g.,\none of the expansions does not include dissipation). On the other hand, this\napproach does not provide the fairly explicit approximations resulting from\nstandard matching. In fact, this is not even its aim, which to produce the\n\"simplest\" set of equations that capture the behavior.\n", "  Hierarchical C@MoS2@C hollow spheres with the active MoS2 nanosheets being\nsandwiched by carbon layers have been produced by means of a modified template\nmethod. The process applies polydopamine (PDA) layers which inhibit morphology\nchange of the template thereby enforcing the hollow microsphere structure. In\naddition, PDA forms complexes with the Mo precursor, leading to an in-situ\ngrowth of MoS2 on its surface and preventing the nanosheets from agglomeration.\nIt also supplies the carbon that finally sandwiches the 100-150 nm thin MoS2\nspheres. The resulting hierarchically structured material provides a stable\nmicrostructure where carbon layers strongly linked to MoS2 offer efficient\npathways for electron and ion transfer, and concomitantly buffer the volume\nchanges inevitably appearing during the charge-discharge process.\nCarbon-sandwiched MoS2-based electrodes exhibit high specific capacity of\napproximately 900 mA h g-1 after 50 cycles at 0.1 C, excellent cycling\nstability up to 200 cycles, and superior rate performance. The versatile\nsynthesis method reported here offers a general route to design hollow sandwich\nstructures with a variety of different active materials.\n", "  A uniformly coated MoS2/Carbon-nanocomposite with three-dimensional\nhierarchical architecture based on carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC)\nnanofibers is synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method followed by\nthermal annealing at 700 {\\deg}C in Ar atmosphere. Strong hydrogen bonds\nbetween the Mo precursor and the BC nanofibers are found to be crucial for the\nin-situ growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the nanofibers during hydrothermal\nprocess. The unique structure was maintained and the connection between MoS2\nand nanofibers were strengthened in the sintering process, leading to an\nimproved stability of the resulting nanocomposite upon electrochemical cycling.\nThe low-cost and environmentally friendly 3D web-like structure enables\nbinder-free and carbon-free electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, which exhibit\nhigh specific discharge capacities up to 1140 mAh/g at the C-rate of 1 C\nwithout significant capacity fading for over 50 cycles. The porous conductive\nhierarchical structure of the composite endows excellent rate performance by\navoiding the aggregation of the MoS2 nanosheets and by accommodating mechanical\nstress which appears upon electrochemical cycling.\n"]}
