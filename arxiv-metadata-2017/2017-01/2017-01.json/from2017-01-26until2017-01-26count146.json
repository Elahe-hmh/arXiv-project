Special emphasis is given to the origin of the cosmological\nperturbations we see today under the form of the cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies and the large scale structure and to the dark matter and dark\nenergy puzzles.\n", "  Skew algebroid is a natural generalization of the concept of Lie algebroid.\nIn this paper, for a skew algebroid E, its modular class mod(E) is defined in\nthe classical as well as in the supergeometric formulation. It is proved that\nthere is a homogeneous nowhere-vanishing 1-density on E* which is invariant\nwith respect to all Hamiltonian vector fields if and only if E is modular, i.e.\nmod(E)=0. Further, relative modular class of a subalgebroid is introduced and\nstudied together with its application to holonomy, as well as modular class of\na skew algebroid relation. These notions provide, in particular, a unified\napproach to the concepts of a modular class of a Lie algebroid morphism and\nthat of a Poisson map.\n", "  We elaborate the concept of entanglement for multipartite system with bosonic\nand fermionic constituents and its generalization to systems with arbitrary\nparastatistics. The entanglement is characterized in terms of generalized Segre\nmaps, supplementing thus an algebraic approach to the problem by a more\ngeometric point of view.\n", "  We develop a systematic approach to contact and Jacobi structures on graded\nsupermanifolds. In this framework, contact structures are interpreted as\nsymplectic principal GL(1,R)-bundles. Gradings compatible with the\nGL(1,R)-action lead to the concept of a graded contact manifold, in particular\na linear (more generally, n-linear) contact structure. Linear contact\nstructures are proven to be exactly the canonical contact structures on first\njets of line bundles. They provide linear Kirillov (or Jacobi) brackets and\ngive rise to the concept of a Kirillov algebroid, an analog of a Lie algebroid,\nfor which the corresponding cohomology operator is represented not by a vector\nfield (de Rham derivative) but a first-order differential operator. It is shown\nthat one can view Kirillov or Jacobi brackets as homological Hamiltonians on\nlinear contact manifolds. Contact manifolds of degree 2 are studied, as well as\ncontact analogs of Courant algebroids. We define lifting procedures that\nprovide us with constructions of canonical examples of the structures in\nquestion.\n", "  In this paper we consider families of multiparametric $R$-matrices to make a\nsystematic study of the boundary Yang-Baxter equations in order to discuss the\ncorresponding families of multiparametric $K$-matrices. Our results are indeed\nnon-trivial generalization of the $K$-matrix solutions of the {\\cal\n{U}}_{q}[D_{n+1}^{(2)}] vertex model when distinct reflections and extra\nfree-parameters are admissible.\n", "  In recent years, the use of variational analysis techniques in lattice QCD\nhas been demonstrated to be successful in the investigation of the rest-mass\nspectrum of many hadrons. However, due to parity-mixing, more care must be\ntaken for investigations of boosted states to ensure that the projected\ncorrelation functions provided by the variational analysis correspond to the\nsame states at zero momentum. In this paper we present the Parity-Expanded\nVariational Analysis (PEVA) technique, a novel method for ensuring the\nsuccessful and consistent isolation of boosted baryons through a parity\nexpansion of the operator basis used to construct the correlation matrix.\n", "  We show that the Schr\\\"odinger wave functional may be obtained as the product\nintegral of precanonical wave functions on the space of field and space-time\nvariables. The functional derivative Schr\\\"odinger equation underlying the\ncanonical field quantization is derived from the partial derivative covariant\nanalogue of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, which appears in the precanonical field\nquantization based on the De Donder-Weyl generalization of the Hamiltonian\nformalism for field theory. The representations of precanonical quantum\noperators typically contain an ultraviolet parameter $\\varkappa$ of the\ndimension of the inverse spatial volume. The transition from the precanonical\ndescription of quantum fields in terms of Clifford-valued wave functions and\npartial derivative operators to the standard functional Schr\\\"odinger\nrepresentation obtained from canonical quantization is accomplished if\n$\\frac{1}{\\varkappa}\\rightarrow 0$ and $\\frac{1}{\\varkappa}\\gamma_0$ is mapped\nto the infinitesimal spatial volume element $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}$. Thus the\nstandard QFT obtained via canonical quantization corresponds to the quantum\ntheory of fields derived via precanonical quantization in the limiting case of\nan infinitesimal value of the parameter $\\frac{1}{\\varkappa}$.\n", "  The notion of wind Finslerian structure is developed; this is a\ngeneralization of Finsler metrics where the indicatrices at the tangent spaces\nmay not contain the zero vector. In the particular case that these indicatrices\nare ellipsoids, called here wind Riemannian structures, they admit a double\ninterpretation which provides: (a) a model for classical Zermelo's navigation\nproblem even when the trajectories of the moving objects (planes, ships) are\ninfluenced by strong winds or streams, and (b) a natural description of the\ncausal structure of relativistic spacetimes endowed with a non-vanishing\nKilling vector field (SSTK splittings), in terms of Finslerian elements. These\nelements can be regarded as conformally invariant Killing initial data on a\npartial Cauchy hypersurface. The wind Finslerian structure is described in\nterms of two (conic, pseudo) Finsler metrics, one with a convex indicatrix and\nthe other with a concave one. However, the spacetime viewpoint for the wind\nRiemannian case gives a useful unified viewpoint. A thorough study of the\ncausal properties of such a spacetime is carried out in Finslerian terms.\nRanders-Kropina metrics appear as the Finslerian counterpart to the case of an\nSSTK when the Killing vector field is either timelike or lightlike. Among the\napplications, we obtain the solution of Zermelo's navigation with arbitrary\nstationary wind, metric-type properties (distance-type arrival function,\ncompleteness, existence of minimizing, maximizing or closed geodesics), as well\nas description of spacetime elements (Cauchy developments, black hole horizons)\nin terms of Finslerian elements in Killing initial data. A general Fermat's\nprinciple of independent interest for arbitrary spacetimes, as well as its\napplications to SSTK spacetimes and Zermelo's navigation, are also provided.\n", "  Changing the variables in the Bethe Ansatz Equations (BAE) for the XXZ\nsix-vertex model we had obtained a coupled system of polynomial equations. This\nprovided a direct link between the BAE deduced from the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz\n(ABA) and the BAE arising from the Coordinate Bethe Ansatz (CBA). For two\nmagnon states this polynomial system could be decoupled and the solutions given\nin terms of the roots of some self-inversive polynomials. From theorems\nconcerning the distribution of the roots of self-inversive polynomials we made\na thorough analysis of the two magnon states, which allowed us to find the\nlocation and multiplicity of the Bethe roots in the complex plane, to discuss\nthe completeness and singularities of Bethe's equations, the ill-founded\nstring-hypothesis concerning the location of their roots, as well as to find an\ninteresting connection between the BAE with Salem's polynomials.\n", "  We present a first English translation and analysis of a little-known review\nof relativistic cosmology written by Albert Einstein in late 1932. The article,\nwhich was published in 1933 in a book of Einstein papers translated into\nFrench, contains a substantial review of static and dynamic relativistic models\nof the cosmos, culminating in a discussion of the Einstein-de Sitter model. The\narticle offers a valuable contemporaneous insight into Einstein's cosmology in\nthe 1930s and confirms that his interest lay in the development of the simplest\nmodel of the cosmos that could account for observation, rather than an\nexploration of all possible cosmic models. The article also confirms that\nEinstein did not believe that simplistic relativistic models could give an\naccurate description of the early universe.\n", "  We present a sufficient condition for a self-inversive polynomial to have a\nfixed number of roots on the complex unit circle. We also prove that these\nroots are simple when that condition is satisfied. This generalizes the\ncondition found by Lakatos and Losonczi for all the roots of a self-inversive\npolynomial to lie on the complex unit circle.\n", "  We study the semi-discrete directed random polymer model introduced by\nO'Connell and Yor. We obtain a representation for the moment generating\nfunction of the polymer partition function in terms of a determinantal measure.\nThis measure is an extension of the probability measure of the eigenvalues for\nthe Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) in random matrix theory. To establish the\nrelation, we introduce another determinantal measure on larger degrees of\nfreedom and consider its few properties, from which the representation above\nfollows immediately.\n", "  A method is presented for Bayesian model selection without explicitly\ncomputing evidences, by using a combined likelihood and introducing an integer\nmodel selection parameter $n$ so that Bayes factors, or more generally\nposterior odds ratios, may be read off directly from the posterior of $n$. If\nthe total number of models under consideration is specified a priori, the full\njoint parameter space $(\\theta, n)$ of the models is of fixed dimensionality\nand can be explored using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or nested\nsampling methods, without the need for reversible jump MCMC techniques. The\nposterior on $n$ is then obtained by straightforward marginalisation. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our approach by application to several toy models.\nWe then apply it to constraining the dark energy equation-of-state using a\nfree-form reconstruction technique. We show that $\\Lambda$CDM is significantly\nfavoured over all extensions, including the simple $w(z){=}{\\rm constant}$\nmodel.\n", "  Let $n_1,\\ldots,n_k $ be integers larger than or equal to 2. We characterize\nlinear maps $\\phi: M_{n_1\\cdots n_k}\\rightarrow M_{n_1\\cdots n_k}$ such that\n$${\\mathrm rank}\\,(\\phi(A_1\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes\nA_k))=1\\quad\\hbox{whenever}\\quad{\\mathrm rank}\\, (A_1\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes\nA_k)=1 \\quad \\hbox{for all}\\quad A_i \\in M_{n_i},\\, i = 1,\\dots,k.$$ Applying\nthis result, we extend two recent results on linear maps that preserving the\nrank of special classes of matrices.\n", "  We derive stringent limits on neutrinophilic two-Higgs-doublet models from\nlow-energy observables after the discovery of the Higgs boson and of the mixing\nangle $\\theta_{13}$. These decays can constrain the plane spanned by\n$m_{H^\\pm}$, the mass of the new charged Higgs, and $v_2$, the vacuum\nexpectation value of the new neutrinophilic scalar doublet. Lepton flavor\nconserving decays are not able to set meaningful bounds, since they depend\nstrongly on the unknown neutrino absolute mass scale. On the other hand, loop\ninduced lepton flavor violating decays, such as $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$, $\\mu \\to 3\ne $ or $\\mu \\to e$ in nuclei are currently responsable for the best limits\ntoday. If $v_2 \\lesssim 1 \\, (0.1)$ eV we get $m_{H^\\pm} \\gtrsim 250 \\, (2500)$\nGeV at 90% CL. In the foreseen future these limits can improve by at least a\nfactor of 100.\n", "  We show that extreme Myers-Perry initial data realize the unique absolute\nminimum of the total mass in a physically relevant (Brill) class of maximal,\nasymptotically flat, bi-axisymmetric initial data for the Einstein equations\nwith fixed angular momenta. As a consequence, we prove the relevant\nmass-angular momentum inequality in this setting for 5-dimensional spacetimes.\nThat is, all data in this class satisfy the inequality $m^3\\geq\n\\frac{27\\pi}{32}\\left(|\\mathcal{J}_1|+|\\mathcal{J}_2|\\right)^2$, where $m$ and\n$\\mathcal{J}_i$, $i=1,2$ are the total mass and angular momenta of the\nspacetime. Moreover, equality holds if and only if the initial data set is\nisometric to the canonical slice of an extreme Myers-Perry black hole.\n", "  Our SLq(2) extension of the standard model is constructed by replacing the\nelementary field operators, $\\Psi (x)$, of the standard model by\n$\\hat{\\Psi}^{j}_{mm'}(x) D^{j}_{mm'}$ where $D^{j}_{mm'}$ is an element of the\n$2j + 1$ dimensional representation of the SLq(2) algebra, which is also the\nknot algebra. The allowed quantum states $(j,m,m')$ are restricted by the\ntopological conditions \\begin{equation*} (j,m,m') = \\frac{1}{2}(N,w,r+o)\n\\end{equation*} postulated between the states of the quantum knot $(j,m,m')$\nand the corresponding classical knot $(N,w,r+o)$ where the $(N,w,r)$ are (the\nnumber of crossings, the writhe, the rotation) of the 2d projection of the\ncorresponding oriented classical knot. Here $o$ is an odd number that is\nrequired by the difference in parity between $w$ and $r$. There is also the\nempirical restriction on the allowed states \\begin{equation*}\n(j,m,m')=3(t,-t_3,-t_0)_L \\end{equation*} that holds at the $j=\\frac{3}{2}$\nlevel, connecting quantum trefoils $(\\frac{3}{2},m,m')$ with leptons and quarks\n$(\\frac{1}{2}, -t_3, -t_0)_L$. The so constructed knotted leptons and quarks\nturn out to be composed of three $j=\\frac{1}{2}$ particles which unexpectedly\nagree with the preon models of Harrari and Shupe. The $j=0$ particles, being\nelectroweak neutral, are dark and plausibly greatly outnumber the quarks and\nleptons. The SLq(2) or $(j,m,m')$ measure of charge has a direct physical\ninterpretation since $2j$ is the total number of preonic charges while $2m$ and\n$2m'$ are the numbers of writhe and rotation sources of preonic charge. The\ntotal SLq(2) charge of a particle, measured by writhe and rotation and composed\nof preons, sums the signs of the counterclockwise turns $(+1)$ and clockwise\nturns $(-1)$ that any energy-momentum current makes in going once around the\nknot...\n  Keywords: Quantum group; electroweak; knot models; preon models; dark matter.\n", "  We evaluate differential cross sections for production of four jets in\nmulti-Regge kinematics at a hadron collider. The main focus lies on azimuthal\nangle dependences. As in previous studies, the ratios of correlation functions\nof products of cosines of azimuthal angle differences among the tagged jets\noffer us the cleanest quantities to compare with experimental data. The\ncalculations are based on the jet production from a single BFKL ladder with a\nconvolution of three BFKL Green functions where we always have two\nforward/backward jets tagged in the final state. We also demand the tagging of\ntwo further jets in more central regions of the detectors with a relative\nseparation in rapidity from each other, plus the inclusive production of an\narbitrary number of mini-jets. We show that dependences on the transverse\nmomenta and rapidity of the two central jets can be a distinct signal of the\nonset of BFKL dynamics.\n", "  We estimate the success probability of quantum protocols composed of Clifford\noperations in the presence of Pauli errors. Our method is derived from the\nfault-point formalism previously used to determine the success rate of\nlow-distance error correction codes. Here we apply it to a wider range of\nquantum protocols and identify circuit structures that allow for efficient\ncalculation of the exact success probability and even the final distribution of\noutput states. As examples, we apply our method to the Bernstein-Vazirani\nalgorithm and the Steane [[7,1,3]] quantum error correction code and compare\nthe results to Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Fermi's golden rule underpins the investigation of mobile carriers\npropagating through various solids, being a standard tool to calculate their\nscattering rates. As such, it provides a perturbative estimate under the\nimplicit assumption that the effect of the interaction Hamiltonian which causes\nthe scattering events is sufficiently small. To check the validity of this\nassumption, we present a general framework to derive simple validity criteria\nin order to assess whether the scattering rates can be trusted for the system\nunder consideration, given its statistical properties such as average size,\nelectron density, impurity density et cetera. We derive concrete validity\ncriteria for metallic nanowires with conduction electrons populating a single\nparabolic band subjected to different elastic scattering mechanisms:\nimpurities, grain boundaries and surface roughness.\n", "  We consider the correlation functions of Coulomb branch operators in\nfour-dimensional N=2 Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs) involving exactly\none anti-chiral operator. These extremal correlators are the \"minimal\"\nnon-holomorphic local observables in the theory. We show that they can be\nexpressed in terms of certain determinants of derivatives of the four-sphere\npartition function of an appropriate deformation of the SCFT. This relation\nbetween the extremal correlators and the deformed four-sphere partition\nfunction is non-trivial due to the presence of conformal anomalies, which lead\nto operator mixing on the sphere. Evaluating the deformed four-sphere partition\nfunction using supersymmetric localization, we compute the extremal correlators\nexplicitly in many interesting examples. Additionally, the representation of\nthe extremal correlators mentioned above leads to a system of integrable\ndifferential equations. We compare our exact results with previous perturbative\ncomputations and with the four-dimensional tt^* equations. We also use our\nresults to study some of the asymptotic properties of the perturbative series\nexpansions we obtain in N=2 SQCD.\n", "  We find optimality conditions for testers in discrimination of quantum\nchannels. These conditions are obtained using semidefinite programming and are\nsimilar to optimality conditions for POVMs obtained by Holevo for ensembles of\nquantum states. We get a simple condition for existence of an optimal tester\nwith any given input state with maximal Schmidt rank, in particular with a\nmaximally entangled input state and we show the pitfalls of using input states\nwith not maximal Schmidt rank. In case when maximally entangled state is not\nthe optimal input state an error estimate is obtained. The results for\nmaximally entangled input state are applied to covariant channels, qubit\nchannels, unitary channels and simple projective measurements.\n", "  Triangular flow $v_3$ of identified and inclusive particles in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV is studied as a function of centrality\nand transverse momentum within the \\textsc{hydjet++} model. The model enables\none to investigate the influence of both hard processes and final-state\ninteractions on the harmonics of particle anisotropic flow. Decays of\nresonances are found to increase the magnitude of the $v_3(p_{\\rm T})$\ndistributions at $p_{\\rm T} \\geq 2$ GeV/$c$ and shift their maxima to higher\ntransverse momenta. The $p_{\\rm T}$-integrated triangular flow, however,\nbecomes slightly weakened for all centralities studied. The resonance decays\nalso modify the spectra towards the number-of-constituent-quark scaling\nfulfillment for the triangular flow, whereas jets are the main source of the\nscaling violation at the energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). Comparison with the corresponding spectra of elliptic flow reveals that\nresonance decays and jets act in a similar manner on both $v_3(p_{\\rm T})$ and\n$v_2(p_{\\rm T})$ behavior. Obtained results are also confronted with the\nexperimental data on differential triangular flow of identified hadrons, ratio\n$v_3^{1/3}(p_{\\rm T}) / v_2^{1/2}(p_{\\rm T})$ and $p_{\\rm T}$-integrated\ntriangular flow of charged hadrons.\n", "  The electric or magnetic field of an ideal dipole is known to have a Dirac\ndelta function at the origin. The usual textbook derivation of this delta\nfunction is rather ad hoc and cannot be used to calculate the delta-function\nstructure for higher multipole moments. Moreover, a naive application of\nGauss's law to the ideal dipole field appears to give an incorrect expression\nfor the dipole's effective charge density. We derive a general result for the\ndelta-function structure at the origin of an arbitrary ideal multipole field\nwithout using any advanced techniques from distribution theory. We find that\nthe divergence of a singular vector field can contain a $\\textit{derivative}$\nof a Dirac delta function even if the field itself does not contain a delta\nfunction. We also argue that a physical interpretation of the delta function in\nthe dipole field previously given in the literature is incorrect.\n", "  It is known that a necessary and sufficient condition for equality in the\ndata processing inequality (DPI) for the quantum relative entropy is the\nexistence of a recovery map. We show that equality in DPI for a sandwiched\nR\\'enyi relative $\\alpha$-entropy with $\\alpha>1$ is also equivalent to this\nproperty. For the proof, we use an interpolating family of $L_p$-norms with\nrespect to a state.\n", "  Dielectric metasurfaces are two-dimensional structures composed of\nnano-scatterers that manipulate phase and polarization of optical waves with\nsubwavelength spatial resolution, enabling ultra-thin components for free-space\noptics. While high performance devices with various functionalities, including\nsome that are difficult to achieve using conventional optical setups have been\nshown, most demonstrated components have a fixed functionality. Here we\ndemonstrate highly tunable metasurface devices based on subwavelength thick\nsilicon nano-posts encapsulated in a thin transparent elastic polymer. As proof\nof concept, we demonstrate a metasurface microlens operating at 915 nm, with\nfocal distance tuning from 600 $\\mu$m to 1400 $\\mu$m through radial strain,\nwhile maintaining a diffraction limited focus and a focusing efficiency above\n50$\\%$. The demonstrated tunable metasurface concept is highly versatile for\ndeveloping ultra-slim, multi-functional and tunable optical devices with\nwidespread applications ranging from consumer electronics to medical devices\nand optical communications.\n", "  We present an approach for modeling nanoscale wetting and dewetting of liquid\nsurfaces that exploits recently developed, sophisticated techniques for\ncomputing van der Waals (vdW) or (more generally) Casimir forces in arbitrary\ngeometries. We solve the variational formulation of the Young--Laplace equation\nto predict the equilibrium shapes of fluid--vacuum interfaces near solid\ngratings and show that the non-additivity of vdW interactions can have a\nsignificant impact on the shape and wetting properties of the liquid surface,\nleading to very different surface profiles and wetting transitions compared to\npredictions based on commonly employed additive approximations, such as Hamaker\nor Derjaguin approximations.\n", "  We review some of the techniques used to study the dynamics of disordered\nsystems subject to both quenched and fast (thermal) noise. Starting from the\nMartin-Siggia-Rose path integral formalism for a single variable stochastic\ndynamics, we provide a pedagogical survey of the perturbative, i.e.\ndiagrammatic, approach to dynamics and how this formalism can be used for\nstudying soft spin models. We review the supersymmetric formulation of the\nLangevin dynamics of these models and discuss the physical implications of the\nsupersymmetry. We also describe the key steps involved in studying the\ndisorder-averaged dynamics. Finally, we discuss the path integral approach for\nthe case of hard Ising spins and review some recent developments in the\ndynamics of such kinetic Ising models.\n", "  Optical metasurfaces are two-dimensional arrays of nano-scatterers that\nmodify optical wavefronts at subwavelength spatial resolution. They are poised\nto revolutionize optics by enabling complex low-cost systems where multiple\nmetasurfaces are lithographically stacked and integrated with electronics. For\nimaging applications, metasurface stacks can perform sophisticated image\ncorrections and can be directly integrated with image sensors. Here, we\ndemonstrate this concept with a miniature flat camera integrating a monolithic\nmetasurface lens doublet corrected for monochromatic aberrations, and an image\nsensor. The doublet lens, which acts as a fisheye photographic objective, has a\nsmall $f$-number of 0.9, an angle-of-view larger than\n60$^\\circ\\times$60$^\\circ$, and operates at 850 nm wavelength with 70% focusing\nefficiency. The camera exhibits nearly diffraction-limited image quality, which\nindicates the potential of this technology in the development of optical\nsystems for microscopy, photography, and computer vision.\n", "  In quantum sensing and metrology, an important class of measurement is the\ncontinuous linear measurement, in which the detector is coupled to the system\nof interest linearly and continuously in time. One key aspect involved is the\nquantum noise of the detector, arising from quantum fluctuations in the\ndetector input and output. It determines how fast we acquire information about\nthe system and also influences the system evolution in terms of measurement\nbackaction. We therefore often categorize it as the so-called imprecision noise\nand quantum backaction noise. There is a general Heisenberg-like uncertainty\nrelation that constrains the magnitude of and the correlation between these two\ntypes of quantum noise. The main result of this paper is to show that, when the\ndetector becomes ideal, i.e., at the quantum limit with minimum uncertainty,\nnot only does the uncertainty relation takes the equal sign as expected, but\nalso there are two new equalities. This general result is illustrated by using\nthe typical cavity QED setup with the system being either a qubit or a\nmechanical oscillator. Particularly, the dispersive readout of a qubit state,\nand the measurement of mechanical motional sideband asymmetry are considered.\n", "  We present the first predictions for sub-threshold open charm and charmonium\nproduction in nuclear collisions. The production mechanism is driven by\nmulti-step scatterings of nucleons and their resonance states, accumulating\nsufficient energy for the production of $J/\\Psi$, $\\Lambda_c + \\overline{D}$\nand $D+\\overline{D}$. Our results are of particular importance for the CBM\nexperiment at FAIR, as they indicate that already at the SIS100 accelerator one\ncan expect a significant number of charmed hadrons to be produced. This opens\nnew possibilities to explore charm dynamics and the formation of charmed\nnuclei.\n", "  The freezeout conditions in proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\textrm{NN}}}= 200$, $900$ and $7000$ GeV have been extracted by fits\nto the mean hadron yields at mid-rapidity within the framework of the\nstatistical model of an ideal gas of hadrons and resonances in the grand\ncanonical ensemble. The variation of the extracted freezeout thermal parameters\nand the goodness of the fits with $\\sqrt{s_{\\textrm{NN}}}$ are discussed. We\nfind the extracted temperature and baryon chemical potential of the freezeout\nsurface to be similar in p+p and heavy ion collisions. On the other hand, the\nthermal behaviour of the strange hadrons is qualitatively different in p+p as\ncompared to A+A. We find an additional parameter accounting for non-equilibrium\nstrangeness production is essential for describing the p+p data. This is in\ncontrast to A+A where the non-equilibrium framework could be successfully\nreplaced by a sequential and complete equilibrium model with an early freezeout\nof the strange hadrons.\n", "  Viable explanations of a hinted 750 GeV scalar resonance may be sought within\nthe extensions of the SM Higgs sector aimed at generating neutrino masses at\nthe loop level. We confront a compatibility with the 750 GeV diphoton excess\nfor two recent models which do not need to impose ad hoc symmetry to forbid the\ntree-level masses: a one-loop mass model providing the H(750) candidate within\nits real triplet scalar representation and a three-loop mass model providing it\nwithin its two Higgs doublets. Besides accounting for the 750 GeV resonance, we\ndemonstrate that these complementary neutrino-mass scenarios have different\ntestable predictions for the LHC which should show up soon as more data is\naccumulated during the ongoing 13 TeV run.\n", "  A modeling approach, based on an analytical solution of the semiclassical\nmulti-subband Boltzmann transport equation, is presented to study resistivity\nscaling in metallic thin films and nanowires due to grain boundary and surface\nroughness scattering. While taking into account the detailed statistical\nproperties of grains, roughness and barrier material as well as the metallic\nband structure and quantum mechanical aspects of scattering and confinement,\nthe model does not rely on phenomenological fitting parameters.\n", "  We present a broadband optical-conductivity study of superconducting\nsingle-crystalline EuFe2(As1-xPx)2 with three different substitutional levels.\nWe analyze the normal-state electrodynamics by decomposing the conductivity\nspectra using a Drude-Lorentz model with two Drude terms representing two\ngroups of carriers with different scattering rates. The analysis reveals that\nthe scattering rate of at least one of the Drude components develops linearly\nwith temperature for each doping level. This points towards strong\nelectron-electron correlations and a non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the\nP-substituted superconducting Eu-122 pnictides. We also detect a transfer of\nthe spectral weight from mid-infrared to higher frequencies and assign it to\nthe Hund's-rule coupling between itinerant and localized carriers. The\nconductivity spectra below the superconducting transition show no sharp\nfeatures to be associated with the dirty-limit superconducting BCS gaps. We\ninterpret these results in terms of clean-limit superconductivity in\nEuFe2(As1-xPx)2. The best parametrization fit can be achieved using a two-gap\nmodel. We find that the larger gap at the hole pockets of the Fermi surface is\nlikely to be isotropic, while the smaller gap at the electron pockets is\nanisotropic or even nodal.\n", "  We present a Born-Infeld gravity theory based on generalizations of Maxwell\nsymmetries denoted as $\\mathfrak{C}_{m}$. We analyze different configuration\nlimits allowing to recover diverse Lovelock gravity actions in six dimensions.\nFurther, the generalization to higher even dimensions is also considered.\n", "  We use 28 Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, measurements at intermediate redshifts\n$0.07 \\leq z \\leq 2.3$ to determine the present-day Hubble constant $H_0$ in\nfour cosmological models. We measure $H_0 = 68.3^{ +2.7}_{ -2.6 }, 68.4^{ +2.9\n}_{ -3.3 }, 65.0^{ +6.5 }_{ -6.6 }$ and $ 67.9^{ +2.4}_{-2.4}$ km s${}^{-1}$\nMpc${}^{-1}$ (1$\\sigma$ errors) in the $\\Lambda$CDM (spatially flat and\nnon-flat), $\\omega$CDM and $\\phi$CDM models, respectively. These measured $H_0$\nvalues are more consistent with the lower values determined from recent cosmic\nmicrowave background and baryon acoustic oscillation data, as well as with that\nfound from a median statistics analysis of Huchra's compilation of $H_0$\nmeasurements,but include the higher local measurements of $H_0$ within the\n2$\\sigma$ confidence limits.\n", "  A new method to determine the breakdown voltage of SiPMs is presented. It is\nbacked up by a DC model which describes the breakdown phenomenon by distinct\navalanche turn-on ($V_{01}$) and turn off ($V_{10}$) voltages. It is shown that\n$V_{01}$ is related to the 'breakdown voltage' that previous DC methods derive\nfrom simple reverse current-voltage measurements, while $V_{10}$ is the 'real'\nbreakdown voltage commonly obtained from complex gain-voltage measurements. The\nproposed method reveals how the microcell population distributes around\n$V_{01}$ and $V_{10}$. It is found that if this distribution is assumed to be\nnormal, then both voltages and even their standard deviation can readily be\nextracted from current-voltage curves. Measurements are in good agreement with\nthe theoretical model.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic Ising model is investigated on the 20 2-uniform\nlattices using the Monte-Carlo method based on the Wang-Landau algorithm and\nthe Metropolis algorithm to study the geometric frustration effect\nsystematically. Based on the specific heat, the residual entropy, and the\nEdwards-Anderson freezing order parameter, the ground states of them were\ndetermined. In addition to the long-range-ordered phase and the spin ice phase\nfound in the Archimedean lattices, two more phases were found. The partial\nlong-range order is long-range order with exceptional disordered sites, which\ngives extensive residual entropy. In the partial spin ice phase, the partial\nfreezing phenomenon appears: Majority of sites are frozen without long-range\norder, but the other sites are fluctuating even at zero temperature. The spin\nliquid ground state was not found in the 2-uniform lattices.\n", "  Data-driven model-independent reconstructions of the dark energy equation of\nstate $w(z)$ are presented using Planck 2015 era CMB, BAO, SNIa and\nLyman-$\\alpha$ data. These reconstructions identify the $w(z)$ behaviour\nsupported by the data and show a bifurcation of the equation of state posterior\nin the range $1.5{<}z{<}3$. Although the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model is\nconsistent with the data at all redshifts in one of the bifurcated spaces, in\nthe other a supernegative equation of state (also known as `phantom dark\nenergy') is identified within the $1.5 \\sigma$ confidence intervals of the\nposterior distribution. To identify the power of different datasets in\nconstraining the dark energy equation of state, we use a novel formulation of\nthe Kullback--Leibler divergence. This formalism quantifies the information the\ndata add when moving from priors to posteriors for each possible dataset\ncombination. The SNIa and BAO datasets are shown to provide much more\nconstraining power in comparison to the Lyman-$\\alpha$ datasets. Further, SNIa\nand BAO constrain most strongly around redshift range $0.1-0.5$, whilst the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ data constrains weakly over a broader range. We do not attribute\nthe supernegative favouring to any particular dataset, and note that the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model was favoured at more than $2$ log-units in Bayes factors\nover all the models tested despite the weakly preferred $w(z)$ structure in the\ndata.\n", "  In this work we study the so-called quantitative complementarity quantities.\nWe focus in the following physical situation: two qubits ($q_A$ and $q_B$) are\ninitially in a maximally entangled state. One of them ($q_B$) interacts with a\n$N$-qubit system ($R$). After the interaction, projective measurements are\nperformed in each of the qubits of $R$, in a basis that is chosen after\nindependent optimization procedures: maximization of the visibility, the\nconcurrence and the predictability. For a specific maximization procedure, we\nstudy in details how each of the complementary quantities behave, conditioned\non the intensity of the coupling between $q_B$ and the $N$ qubits. We show\nthat, if the coupling is sufficiently \"strong\", independent of the maximization\nprocedure, the concurrence tends to decay quickly. Interestingly enough, the\nbehavior of the concurrence in this model is similar to the entanglement\ndynamics of a two qubit system subjected to a thermal reservoir, despite that\nwe consider finite $N$. However the visibility shows a different behavior: its\nmaximization is more efficient for stronger coupling constants. Moreover, we\ninvestigate how the distinguishability, or the information stored in different\nparts of the system, is distributed for different couplings.\n", "  We study the Dunkl oscillator in two dimensions by the $su(1,1)$ algebraic\nmethod. We apply the Schr\\\"odinger factorization to the radial Hamiltonian of\nthe Dunkl oscillator to find the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra generators. The energy\nspectrum is found by using the theory of unitary irreducible representations.\nBy solving analytically the Schr\\\"odinger equation, we construct the Sturmian\nbasis for the unitary irreducible representations of the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra.\nWe construct the $SU(1,1)$ Perelomov radial coherent states for this problem\nand compute their time evolution.\n", "  The WZ production cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV is measured with the CMS experiment at the LHC using a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. The\nmeasurement is performed in the leptonic decay modes WZ to l nu l' l', where l,\nl'= e, mu. The measured cross section for the range 60 < m[l'l'] < 120 GeV is\nsigma(pp to WZ) = 39.9 +/- 3.2 (stat) +2.9/-3.1 (syst) +/- 0.4 (theo) +/- 1.3\n(lumi) pb, consistent with the standard model prediction.\n", "  We show that the three different looking BPS partition functions, namely the\nelliptic genus of the 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ $Sp(1)$ gauge theory with $10$\nflavors and a tensor multiplet, the Nekrasov partition function of the 5d\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(2)$ gauge theory with $10$ flavors, and the Nekrasov\npartition function of the 5d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(3)$ gauge theory with $10$\nflavors, are all equal to each other under specific maps among gauge theory\nparameters. This result strongly suggests that the three gauge theories have an\nidentical UV fixed point. Type IIB 5-brane web diagrams play an essential role\nto compute the $SU(3)$ Nekrasov partition function as well as establishing the\nmaps.\n", "  It has been shown that, if a model displays long-range (power-law) spatial\ncorrelations, its equal-time correlation matrix of this model will also have a\npower law tail in the distribution of its high-lying eigenvalues. The purpose\nof this letter is to show that the converse is generally incorrect: a power-law\ntail in the high-lying eigenvalues of the correlation matrix may exist even in\nthe absence of equal-time power law correlations in the original model. We may\ntherefore view the study of the eigenvalue distribution of the correlation\nmatrix as a more powerful tool than the study of correlations, one which may in\nfact uncover structure, that would otherwise not be apparent. Specifically, we\nshow that in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process, whereas there are\nno clearly visible correlations in the steady state, the eigenvalues of its\ncorrelation matrix exhibit a rich structure which we describe in detail.\n", "  A measurement of the calorimeter response to isolated charged hadrons in the\nATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. This measurement is performed with 3.2\nnb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV from 2010 and\n0.1 nb$^{-1}$ of data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV from 2012. A number of aspects of the\ncalorimeter response to isolated hadrons are explored. After accounting for\nenergy deposited by neutral particles, there is a 5\\% discrepancy in the\nmodelling, using Geant4 physics lists, of the calorimeter response to isolated\ncharged hadrons in the central calorimeter region. The description of the\nresponse to anti-protons at low momenta is found to be improved with respect to\nprevious analyses. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are also\nexamined separately, and the detector simulation is found to describe the\nresponse in the hadronic calorimeter well. The jet energy scale uncertainty and\ncorrelations in scale between jets of different momenta are derived based on\nthese studies. The uncertainty is 2--5\\% for jets with transverse momenta above\n2 TeV, where this method provides the jet energy scale uncertainty for ATLAS.\n", "  Nebular-phase observations and spectral models of Type Ic superluminous\nsupernovae are presented. LSQ14an and SN 2015bn both display late-time spectra\nsimilar to galaxy-subtracted spectra of SN 2007bi, and the class shows strong\nsimilarity with broad-lined Type Ic SNe such as SN 1998bw. Near-infrared\nobservations of SN 2015bn show a strong Ca II triplet, O I 9263, O I 1.13 um\nand Mg I 1.50 um, but no distinct He, Si, or S emission. The high Ca II NIR/[Ca\nII] 7291,7323 ratio of ~2 indicates a high electron density of n_e >~ 10^8\ncm^{-3}. Spectral models of oxygen-zone emission are investigated to put\nconstraints on the emitting region. Models require M(O-zone) >~ 10 Msun to\nproduce enough [O I] 6300,6364 luminosity, irrespective of the powering\nsituation and the density. The high oxygen-zone mass, supported by high\nestimated magnesium masses, points to explosions of massive CO cores, requiring\nM_ZAMS >~ 40 Msun. Collisions of pair-instability pulsations do not provide\nenough mass to account for the emission. [O II] and [O III] lines emerge\nnaturally in many models, which strengthens the identification of broad [O II]\n7320,7330, [O III] 4363, and [O III] 4959,5007 in some spectra. A small filling\nfactor f <~ 0.01 for the O/Mg zone is needed to produce enough luminosity in Mg\nI] 4571, Mg I 1.504 um, and O I recombination lines, which shows that the\nejecta is clumped. We review the constraints from the nebular spectral\nmodelling in the context of the various scenarios proposed for superluminous\nsupernovae.\n", "  Recent experiments revealed that Mn3Sn and Mn3Ge exhibit a strong anomalous\nHall effect at room temperature, provoking us to explore their electronic\nstructures for topological properties. By ab initio band structure\ncalculations, we have observed the existence of multiple Weyl points in the\nbulk and corresponding Fermi arcs on the surface, predicting antiferromagnetic\nWeyl semimetals in Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn. Here the chiral antiferromagnetism in the\nKagome-type lattice structure is essential to determine the positions and\nnumbers of Weyl points. Our work further reveals a new guiding principle to\nsearch for magnetic Weyl semimetals among materials that exhibit a strong\nanomalous Hall effect.\n", "  Magnetism in two-dimensional materials is not only of fundamental scientific\ninterest but also a promising candidate for numerous applications. However,\nstudies so far, especially the experimental ones, have been mostly limited to\nthe magnetism arising from defects, vacancies, edges or chemical dopants which\nare all extrinsic effects. Here, we report on the observation of intrinsic\nantiferromagnetic ordering in the two-dimensional limit. By monitoring the\nRaman peaks that arise from zone folding due to antiferromagnetic ordering at\nthe transition temperature, we demonstrate that FePS3 exhibits an Ising-type\nantiferromagnetic ordering down to the monolayer limit, in good agreement with\nthe Onsager solution for two-dimensional order-disorder transition. The\ntransition temperature remains almost independent of the thickness from bulk to\nthe monolayer limit with TN ~118 K, indicating that the weak interlayer\ninteraction has little effect on the antiferromagnetic ordering.\n", "  We give the geralized expression of spin precession of extended bunch\nparticles having both anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments in storage\nring in higher order than the previous work and in the presence of ${\\bf E}$\nfield as well as ${\\bf B}$ field. These addenda are essential since some\nexperiments consider the focusing field in the second order of the beam extent\nand in the presence of both ${\\bf B}$ and ${\\bf E}$ fields . It is shown that\nsome focusing fields with constant magnitude of the velocity considered in many\nliteratures lead to the violation of self consistency.\n", "  We show that the technique known as concatenated continuous dynamical\ndecoupling (CCD) can be applied to a trapped-ion setup for a robust\nimplementation of the quantum Rabi model in a variety of parameter regimes.\nThese include the case where the Dirac equation emerges, and the limit in which\na quantum phase transition takes place. We discuss the applicability of the CCD\nscheme in terms of the fidelity between different initial states evolving under\nan ideal quantum Rabi model and their corresponding trapped-ion realization,\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of noise suppression of our method.\n", "  We study the scaling behaviour of the optical conductivity $(\\sigma)$, free\nenergy density $(F)$ and shear viscosity of the quantum critical point\nassociated with spin density wave phase transition for a two-dimensional\nmetallic system with $C_2$ symmetry. A non-Fermi liquid behaviour emerges at\ntwo pairs of isolated points on the Fermi surface due to the coupling of a\nbosonic order parameter to fermionic excitations at those so-called\n\"hot-spots\". We find that near the hot-spots, $\\sigma$ and $F$ obey the\nscalings expected for such an anisotropic system, and the direction-dependent\nviscosity to entropy density ratio is not a universal number due to the\nanisotropy. Lastly, we also estimate the effect of the fermion-boson coupling\nat the hot-spots on superconducting instabilities.\n", "  We investigate spin transport in two dimensional ferromagnetic (FTI) and\nantiferromagnetic (AFTI) topological insulators. In presence of an in plane\nmagnetization AFTI supports zero energy modes, which enables topologically\nprotected edge conduction at low energy. We address the nature of\ncurrent-driven spin torque in these structures and study the impact of\nspin-independent disorder. Interestingly, upon strong disorder the spin torque\ndevelops an antidamping component (i.e. {\\em even} upon magnetization reversal)\nalong the edges, which could enable current-driven manipulation of the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter. This antidamping torque decreases when\nincreasing the system size and when the system enters the trivial insulator\nregime.\n", "  Using the mass-smeared scheme of black holes, we study the thermodynamics of\nblack holes. Two interesting models are considered. One is the self-regular\nSchwarzschild-AdS black hole whose mass density is given by the analogue to\nprobability densities of quantum hydrogen atoms. The other model is the same\nblack hole but whose mass density is chosen to be a rational fractional\nfunction of radial coordinates. Both mass densities are in fact analytic\nexpressions of the ${\\delta}$-function. We analyze the phase structures of the\ntwo models by investigating the heat capacity at constant pressure and the\nGibbs free energy in an isothermal-isobaric ensemble. Both models fail to decay\ninto the pure thermal radiation even with the positive Gibbs free energy due to\nthe existence of a minimal length. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a\ngeneral mass-smeared form that is also associated with the ${\\delta}$-function,\nand indicate the similar thermodynamic properties for various possible\nmass-smeared forms based on the ${\\delta}$-function.\n", "  We consider functions of Wiener--Hopf type operators on the Hilbert space\n$L^2(\\mathbb R^d)$. It has been known for a long time that the quasi-classical\nasymptotics for traces of resulting operators strongly depend on the smoothness\nof the symbol: for smooth symbols the expansion is power-like, whereas\ndiscontinuous symbols (e.g. indicator functions) produce an extra logarithmic\nfactor. We investigate the transition regime by studying symbols depending on\nan extra parameter $T\\ge 0$ in such a way that the symbol tends to a\ndiscontinuous one as $T\\to 0$. The main result is two-parameter asymptotics (in\nthe quasi-classical parameter and in $T$), describing a transition from the\nsmooth case to the discontinuous one. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used\nto analyse the low-temperature scaling limit of the spatially bipartite\nentanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions.\n", "  This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1\nof the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events\nof potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of\nproton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is\nimplemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals\nconsistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing\ntransverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is\nused to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are\nadjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to\nrestrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout\nelectronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the\npurity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline\nevent storage. The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system\nduring the LHC Run 1 are described.\n", "  We derive a reciprocity relation for vector radiative transport equation\n(vRTE) that describes propagation of polarized light in multiple-scattering\nmedia. We then show how this result, together with translational invariance of\na plane-parallel sample, can be used to compute efficiently the sensitivity\nkernel of diffuse optical tomography (DOT) by Monte Carlo simulations.\nNumerical examples of polarization-selective sensitivity kernels thus computed\nare given.\n", "  We show that topological phases should be realizable in readily available and\nwell studied heterostructures. In particular we identify a new class of\ntopological materials which are well known in spintronics: helical\nferromagnet-superconducting junctions. We note that almost all previous work on\ntopological heterostructures has focused on creating Majorana modes at the\nproximity interface in effectively two-dimensional or one-dimensional systems.\nThe particular heterostructures we address exhibit finite range proximity\neffects leading to nodal superconductors with Majorana modes localized well\naway from this interface. To show this, we implement a Bogoliubov-de Gennes\n(BdG) proximity numerical scheme, which importantly, involves two finite\ndimensions in a three dimensional junction. Incorporating this level of\nnumerical complexity serves to distinguish ours from alternative numerical BdG\napproaches which are limited by generally assuming translational invariance or\nperiodic boundary conditions along multiple directions. With this access to the\nedges, we are then able to illustrate in a concrete fashion the wavefunctions\nof Majorana zero modes, and, moreover, address finite size effects. In the\nprocess we establish consistency with a simple analytical model.\n", "  In previous reports a structural transition from a cubic phase of\nYb$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ - type to the superlattice variant has been reported at\n$\\sim160$ K for a series of skutterudite-related Ce$_3$M$_4$Sn$_{13}$\ncompounds, where M=Co, Ru or Rh. We have simulated the low-temperature XRD\ndiffraction patterns of the distorted unit cell using written for that purpose\nDISTorX program. The method proposed here for x-ray diffraction analysis\nobtains the XRD patterns from the atomic positions and allows to investigate\ncrystal structure without imposed symmetry operations. We have indicated\ncrystallographic plane where distortion occurs and explained possible origin of\nCDW in these materials. We have also shown that distortion caused by the charge\ndensity wave leads to significantly changes of the intensity of diffraction\nlines.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated (Class. Quantum Grav. 31, 085010, 2014)\nthat the conformally invariant wave equation on a Minkowski background can be\nsolved with a fully pseudospectral numerical method. In particular, it is\npossible to include spacelike infinity into the numerical domain, which is\nappropriately represented as a cylinder, and highly accurate numerical\nsolutions can be obtained with a moderate number of gridpoints. In this paper,\nwe generalise these considerations to the spherically-symmetric wave equation\non a Schwarzschild background. In the Minkowski case, a logarithmic singularity\nat the future boundary is present at leading order, which can easily be removed\nto obtain completely regular solutions. An important new feature of the\nSchwarzschild background is that the corresponding solutions develop\nlogarithmic singularities at infinitely many orders. This behaviour seems to be\ncharacteristic for massive space-times. In this sense this work is indicative\nof properties of the solutions of the Einstein equations near spatial infinity.\nThe use of fully pseudospectral methods allows us to still obtain very accurate\nnumerical solutions, and the convergence properties of the spectral\napproximations reveal details about the singular nature of the solutions on\nspacelike and null infinity. These results seem to be impossible to achieve\nwith other current numerical methods. Moreover, we describe how to impose\nconditions on the asymptotic behaviour of initial data so that the\nleading-order logarithmic terms are avoided, which further improves the\nnumerical accuracy.\n", "  The calculation of realistic N-body wave functions for identical fermions is\nstill an open problem in physics, chemistry, and materials science, even for N\nas small as two. A recently discovered fundamental algebraic structure of\nmany-body Hilbert space allows an arbitrary many-fermion wave function to be\nwritten in terms of a finite number of antisymmetric functions called shapes.\nShapes naturally generalize the single-Slater-determinant form for the ground\nstate to more than one dimension. Their number is exactly $N!^{d-1}$ in $d$\ndimensions. An efficient algorithm is described to generate all fermion shapes\nin spaces of odd dimension, which improves on a recently published general\nalgorithm. The results are placed in the context of contemporary investigations\nof strongly correlated electrons.\n", "  The quantum nature of elementary bosons can be completely erased by using\ncoherent states known as Glauber states. Here, we consider composite bosons\n(cobosons) made of two fermions and look for the possibility to erase the\nbosonic quantum nature of the field and the fermionic quantum nature of its\nconstituents, when the distribution of the coboson Schmidt decomposition is\neither flat like Frenkel excitons, or localized like Wannier excitons. We show\nthat for Frenkel-like cobosons, complete erasure of the field quantum nature is\npossible up to a density which corresponds to a sizable fraction of the number\nof fermion-pair states making the coboson at hand. At higher density, the Pauli\nexclusion principle between fermionic constituents shows up dramatically. It\ninduces: (i) the decrease of number-operator eigenvalues down to 1 and the\nincrease of the number-state second-order correlation function up to 2; (ii)\nthe disappearance of the usual sharp peak in the coherent-state distribution\nand the increase of the coherent-state second-order correlation function up to\n2. It also is possible to construct number states and coherent states for\nWannier-like cobosons, but their forms are far more complex. Finally, we show\nthat Pauli blocking makes the coboson coherent states qualitatively different\nfrom the Anderson's ansatz.\n", "  We study a nonequilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-imbalanced\nFermi-Hubbard model following a quantum quench of on-site interaction,\nrealizable, for example, in Feshbach-resonant atomic Fermi gases. We focus on\nthe post-quench evolution starting from the initial BCS and\nFuldeFerrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) ground states and analyze the\ncorresponding spin-singlet, spin-triplet, density-density, and\nmagnetization-magnetization correlation functions. We find that beyond a\nlight-cone crossover time, rich post-quench dynamics leads to thermalized and\npre-thermalized stationary states that display strong dependence on the initial\nground state. For initially gapped BCS state, the long-time stationary state\nresembles thermalization with the effective temperature set by the initial\nvalue of the Hubbard interaction. In contrast, while the initial gapless FFLO\nstate reaches a stationary pre-thermalized form, it remains far from\nequilibrium. We suggest that such post-quench dynamics can be used as a\nfingerprint for identification and study of the FFLO phase.\n", "  Classical real-time lattice simulations play an important role in\nunderstanding non-equilibrium phenomena in gauge theories and are used in\nparticular to model the prethermal evolution of heavy-ion collisions. Due to\ninstabilities, small quantum fluctuations on top of the classical background\nmay significantly affect the dynamics of the system. In this paper we argue for\nthe need for a numerical calculation of a system of classical gauge fields and\nsmall linearized fluctuations in a way that keeps the separation between the\ntwo manifest. We derive and test an explicit algorithm to solve these equations\non the lattice, maintaining gauge invariance and Gauss's law.\n", "  We present numerical results within the one-dimensional disordered Hubbard\nmodel for several characteristic indicators of the many-body localization\n(MBL). Considering traditionally studied charge disorder (i.e., the same\ndisorder strength for both spin orientations) we find that even at strong\ndisorder all signatures consistently show that while charge degree of freedom\nis non-ergodic, the spin is delocalized and ergodic. This indicates the absence\nof the full MBL in the model that has been simulated in recent cold-atom\nexperiments. Full localization can be restored if spin-dependent disorder is\nused instead.\n", "  The graviton exchange effect on cosmological correlation functions is\nexamined by employing the double-soft limit technique. A new relation among\ncorrelation functions that contain the effects due to graviton exchange\ndiagrams in addition to those due to scalar-exchange and\nscalar-contact-interaction, is derived by using the background field method and\nindependently by the method of Ward identities associated with dilatation\nsymmetry. We compare these three terms, putting small values for the slow-roll\nparameters and $(1-n_{s}) = 0.042$, where $n_{s}$ is the scalar spectral index.\nIt is argued that the graviton exchange effects are more dominant than the\nother two and could be observed in the trispectrum in the double-soft limit.\nOur observation strengthens the previous work by Seery, Sloth and Vernizzi, in\nwhich it has been argued that the graviton exchange dominates in the\ncounter-collinear limit for single field slow-roll inflation.\n", "  We develop a three-dimensional kinematic self-sustaining model of the solar\ndynamo in which the poloidal field generation is from tilted bipolar sunspot\npairs placed on the solar surface above regions of strong toroidal field by\nusing the SpotMaker algorithm, and then the transport of this poloidal field to\nthe tachocline is primarily caused by turbulent diffusion. We obtain a dipolar\nsolution within a certain range of parameters. We use this model to study the\nbuild-up of the polar magnetic field and show that some insights obtained from\nsurface flux transport (SFT) models have to be revised. We present results\nobtained by putting a single bipolar sunspot pair in a hemisphere and two\nsymmetrical sunspot pairs in two hemispheres.We find that the polar fields\nproduced by them disappear due to the upward advection of poloidal flux at low\nlatitudes, which emerges as oppositely-signed radial flux and which is then\nadvected poleward by the meridional flow. We also study the effect that a large\nsunspot pair, violating Hale's polarity law would have on the polar field. We\nfind that there would be some effect---especially if the anti-Hale pair appears\nat high latitudes in the mid-phase of the cycle---though the effect is not very\ndramatic.\n", "  Time dynamics of photoexcited electron-hole pairs is important for a number\nof technologies, in particular solar cells. We combined ultrafast pump-probe\nRaman scattering and photoemission to directly follow electron-hole excitations\nas well as the G-phonon in graphite after an excitation by an intense laser\npulse. This phonon is known to couple relatively strongly to electrons.\nCross-correlating effective electronic and phonon temperatures places new\nconstraints on model-based fits. The accepted two-temperature model predicts\nthat G-phonon population should start to increase as soon as excited\nelectron-hole pairs are created and that the rate of increase should not depend\nstrongly on the pump fluence. Instead we found that the increase of the\nG-phonon population occurs with a delay of $\\sim$65 fs. This time-delay is also\nevidenced by the absence of the so-called self-pumping for G phonons. It\ndecreases with increased pump fluence. We show that these observations imply a\nnew relaxation pathway: Instead of hot carriers transferring energy to\nG-phonons directly, the energy is first transferred to optical phonons near the\nzone boundary K-points, which then decay into G-phonons via phonon-phonon\nscattering. Our work demonstrates that phonon-phonon interactions must be\nincluded in any calculations of hot carrier relaxation in optical absorbers\neven when only short timescales are considered.\n", "  We present three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the\nimpact of stellar winds, photoelectric heating, photodissociating and\nphotoionising radiation, and supernovae on the chemical composition and star\nformation in a stratified disc model. This is followed with a sink-based model\nfor star clusters with populations of individual massive stars. Stellar winds\nand ionising radiation regulate the star formation rate at a factor of ~10\nbelow the simulation with only supernova feedback due to their immediate impact\non the ambient interstellar medium after star formation. Ionising radiation\n(with winds and supernovae) significantly reduces the ambient densities for\nmost supernova explosions to rho < 10^-25 g cm^-3, compared to 10^-23 g cm^-3\nfor the model with only winds and supernovae. Radiation from massive stars\nreduces the amount of molecular hydrogen and increases the neutral hydrogen\nmass and volume filling fraction. Only this model results in a molecular gas\ndepletion time scale of 2 Gyr and shows the best agreement with observations.\nIn the radiative models, the Halpha emission is dominated by radiative\nrecombination as opposed to collisional excitation (the dominant emission in\nnon-radiative models), which only contributes ~1-10 % to the total Halpha\nemission. Individual massive stars (M >= 30 M_sun) with short lifetimes are\nresponsible for significant fluctuations in the Halpha luminosities. The\ncorresponding inferred star formation rates can underestimate the true\ninstantaneous star formation rate by factors of ~10.\n", "  Spatial states of single photons and spatially entangled photon pairs are\nbecoming an important resource in quantum communication. This additional degree\nof freedom provides an almost unlimited information capacity, making the\ndevelopment of high-quality sources of spatial entanglement a well-motivated\nresearch direction. We report an experimental method for generation of photon\npairs in a maximally entangled spatial state. In contrast to existing\ntechniques the method does not require post-selection and allows one to use the\nfull photon flux from the nonlinear crystal, providing a tool for creating\nhigh-brightness sources of pure spatially entangled photons. Such sources are a\nprerequisite for emerging applications in free-space quantum communication.\n", "  Parking prices in cities are uniform over large areas and do not reflect\nspatially heterogeneous parking supply and demand. Underpricing results in high\nparking occupancy in the subareas where the demand exceeds supply and long\nsearch for the vacant parking, whereas overpricing leads to low occupancy and\nhampered economic vitality. We present Nearest Pocket for Prices Algorithm\n(NPPA), a spatially explicit algorithm for establishing on-and off-street\nparking prices that guarantee a predetermined uniform level of occupation over\nthe entire parking space. We apply NPPA for establishing heterogeneous parking\nprices that guarantee 90% parking occupancy in the Israeli city of Bat Yam.\n", "  We report the discovery of two new invariants for three-qubit states which,\nsimilarly to the 3-tangle, are invariant under local unitary transformations\nand permutations of the parties. These quantities have a direct interpretation\nin terms of the anisotropy of pairwise spin correlations. Applications include\na universal ordering of pairwise quantum correlation measures for pure\nthree-qubit states; tradeoff relations for anisotropy, 3-tangle and Bell\nnonlocality; strong monogamy relations for Bell inequalities,\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering inequalities, geometric discord and fidelity\nof remote state preparation (including results for arbitrary three-party\nstates); and a statistical and reference-frame-independent form of quantum\nsecret sharing.\n", "  The traceless Ricci tensor $C_{ab}$ in 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces\nequipped with the metric of the neutral signature is analyzed. Its algebraic\nclassification is given. This classification uses the properties of $C_{ab}$\ntreated as a matrix. The Petrov-Penrose types of Pleba\\'nski spinors associated\nwith the traceless Ricci tensor are given. Finally, the classification is\ncompared with a similar classification in the complex case.\n", "  Measurements were made of scintillation light yield of alpha particles from\nthe $^{222}$Rn decay chain within the DarkSide-50 liquid argon time projection\nchamber. The light yield was found to increase as the applied electric field\nincreased, with alphas in a 200 V/cm electric field exhibiting a 2% increase in\nlight yield compared to alphas in no field.\n", "  Poincare recurrence theorem states that any finite system will come arbitrary\nclose to its initial state after some very long but finite time. At the\nstatistical level, this by itself does not represent a paradox, but apparently\nviolates the second law of thermodynamics, which may lead to some confusing\nconclusions for macroscopic systems. However, this statement does not take\ngravity into account. If two particles with a given center of mass energy come\nat the distance shorter than the Schwarzschild diameter apart, according to\nclassical gravity they will form a black hole. In the classical case, a black\nhole once formed will always grow and effectively quench the Poincare\nrecurrence. We derive the condition under which the classical black hole\nproduction rate is higher than the classical Poincare recurrence rate. In the\nquantum case, if the temperature of the black hole is lower than the\ntemperature of the surrounding gas, such a black hole cannot disappear via\nHawking evaporation. We derive the condition which gives us a critical\ntemperature above which the black hole production is faster than quantum\nPoincare recurrence time. However, in quantum case, the quantum Poincare\nrecurrence theorem can be applied to the black hole states too. The presence of\nthe black hole can make the recurrence time longer or shorter, depending on\nwhether the presence of the black hole increases or decreases the total\nentropy. We derive the temperature below which the produced black hole\nincreases the entropy of the whole system (gas particles plus a black hole).\nFinally, if evolution of the system is fast enough, then newly formed black\nholes will merge and accrete particles until one large black hole dominates the\nsystem. We give the temperature above which the presence of black holes\nincrease the entropy of the whole system and prolongs the Poincare recurrence\ntime.\n", "  We investigate the role driven by the scalar meson $\\sigma$ exchange in the\nphotoproduction of the vector meson $\\phi$(1020) off a proton by using a\nReggeized model. Based on the $\\pi^0(135)+\\sigma(500)+f_2(1270)$+Pomeron\nexchanges, we demonstrate that the $\\sigma$ exchange plays the role to\nreproduce the bump structure at the forward angle in the differential cross\nsection as well as the peaking behavior in the total cross section observed in\nthe CLAS Collaboration. We also discuss the possible observation of the scaled\ncross section $s^7d\\sigma /dt$ at the production angle $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$ from\nthe CLAS data. It is found that the axial vector meson $f_1(1285)$ exchange\nwith the trajectory $\\alpha_{f_1}(t)=0.028\\,t+0.9\\pm0.2$ arising from the axial\nanomaly of the QCD vacuum plays the role to clarify the scaling up to 5 GeV.\n", "  The carrier recombination dynamics of InGaP/InGaAsP quantum wells are\nreported for the first time. By studying the photoluminescence (PL) and\ntime-resolved PL decay of InGaP/InGaAsP multiple-quantum-well(MQW)\nheterostructure samples, it is demonstrated that InGaP/InGaAsP MQWs have very\nlow non-radiative recombination rate and high radiative efficiency compared to\nthe control InGaP sample. Along with the analyses of PL emission spectrum and\nexternal quantum efficiencies, it suggests that this is due to small\nconfinement potentials in the conduction band but high confinement potentials\nin the valence band. These results explain several features found in\nInGaP/InGaAsP MQW solar cells previously.\n", "  Recent studies of solar-type superflare stars have suggested that even old\nslowly rotating stars similar to the Sun can have large starspots and\nsuperflares. We conducted high dispersion spectroscopy of 49 nearby\nsolar-analog stars (G-type main sequence stars with\n$T_{\\rm{eff}}\\approx5,600\\sim6,000$ K) identified as ROSAT soft X-ray sources,\nwhich are not binary stars from the previous studies. We expected that these\nstars can be used as a proxy of bright solar-analog superflare stars, since\nsuperflare stars are expected to show strong X-ray luminosity. More than half\n(37) of the 49 target stars show no evidence of binarity, and their atmospheric\nparameters ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$, $\\log g$, and [Fe/H]) are within the range of\nordinary solar-analog stars. We measured Ca II 8542 and H$\\alpha$ lines, which\nare good indicators of the chromospheric activity. The intensity of these lines\nindicates that all the target stars have large starspots. We also measured\n$v\\sin i$ (projected rotational velocity) and Lithium abundance for the target\nstars. Li abundance is a key to understanding the evolution of the stellar\nconvection zone, which reflects the stellar age, mass and rotational history.\nWe confirmed that many of the target stars rapidly rotate and have high Li\nabundance, compared with the Sun, as suggested by many previous studies. There\nare, however, also some target stars that rotate slowly ($v\\sin i$=2$\\sim$3 km\ns$^{-1}$) and have low Li abundance like the Sun. These results support that\nold and slowly rotating stars similar to the Sun could have high activity level\nand large starspots. This is consistent with the results of our previous\nstudies of solar-type superflare stars. In the future, it is important to\nconduct long-term monitoring observations of these active solar-analog stars in\norder to investigate detailed properties of large starspots from the viewpoint\nof stellar dynamo theory.\n", "  We present the theory of resonance fluorescence from an asymmetric quantum\ndot driven by a two-component electromagnetic field with two different\nfrequencies, polarizations and amplitudes (bichromatic field) in the regime of\nstrong light-matter coupling. It follows from the elaborated theory that the\nbroken inversion symmetry of the driven quantum system and the bichromatic\nstructure of the driving field result in unexpected features of the resonance\nfluorescence, including the infinite set of Mollow triplets, the quench of\nfluorescence peaks induced by the dressing field, and the oscillating behavior\nof the fluorescence intensity as a function of the dressing field amplitude.\nThese quantum phenomena are of general physical nature and, therefore, can take\nplace in various double-driven quantum systems with broken inversion symmetry.\n", "  We present numerical evidence that the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the\ntwo-dimensional checkerboard lattice exhibits several magnetization plateaux\nfor m=0, 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4, where m is the magnetization normalized by its\nsaturation value. These incompressible states correspond to somehow similar\nvalence-bond crystal phases that break lattice symmetries, though they are\ndifferent from the already established plaquette phase for m=0. Our results are\nbased on Exact Diagonalization as well as Density Matrix Renormalization Group\nlarge-scale simulations, and interpreted in terms of simple trial\nwavefunctions.\n", "  A$_2$BB$^\\prime$X$_6$ halide double perovskites based on bismuth and silver\nhave recently been proposed as potential environmentally-friendly alternatives\nto lead-based hybrid halide perovskites. In particular, Cs$_2$BiAgX$_6$ (X =\nCl, Br) have been synthesized and found to exhibit band gaps in the visible\nrange. However, the band gaps of these compounds are indirect, which is not\nideal for applications in thin film photovoltaics. Here, we propose a new class\nof halide double perovskites, where the B$^{3+}$ and B$^{+}$ cations are\nIn$^{3+}$ and Ag$^{+}$, respectively. Our first-principles calculations\nindicate that the hypothetical compounds Cs$_2$InAgX$_6$ (X = Cl, Br, I) should\nexhibit direct band gaps between the visible (I) and the ultraviolet (Cl).\nBased on these predictions, we attempt to synthesize Cs$_2$InAgCl$_6$ and\nCs$_2$InAgBr$_6$, and we succeed to form the hitherto unknown double perovskite\nCs$_2$InAgCl$_6$. X-ray diffraction yields a double perovskite structure with\nspace group $Fm\\overline{3}m$. The measured band gap is 3.3 eV, and the\ncompound is found to be photosensitive and turns reversibly from white to\norange under ultraviolet illumination. We also perform an empirical analysis of\nthe stability of Cs$_2$InAgX$_6$ and their mixed halides based on Goldschmidt's\nrules, and we find that it should also be possible to form\nCs$_2$InAg(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_{x}$)$_6$ for $x<1$. The synthesis of mixed halides\nwill open the way to the development of lead-free double perovskites with\ndirect and tunable band gaps.\n", "  The variable star AR Sco was recently discovered to pulse in brightness every\n1.97 min from ultraviolet wavelengths into the radio regime. The system is\ncomposed of a cool, low-mass star in a tight, 3.55 hr orbit with a more massive\nwhite dwarf. Here we report new optical observations of AR Sco that show strong\nlinear polarization (up to 40%) which varies strongly and periodically on both\nthe spin period of the white dwarf and the beat period between the spin and\norbital period, as well as low level (< a few %) circular polarization. These\nobservations support the notion that, similar to neutron star pulsars, the\npulsed luminosity of AR Sco is powered by the spin-down of the rapidly-rotating\nwhite dwarf which is highly magnetised (up to 500 MG). The morphology of the\nmodulated linear polarization is similar to that seen in the Crab pulsar,\nalbeit with a more complex waveform owing to the presence of two periodic\nsignals of similar frequency. Magnetic interactions between the two component\nstars, coupled with synchrotron radiation from the white dwarf, power the\nobserved polarized and non-polarized emission. AR Scorpii is therefore the\nfirst example of a white dwarf pulsar.\n", "  The majority-vote model with noise was studied on the eleven Archimedean\nlattices by the Monte-Carlo method and the finite-size scaling. The critical\nnoises and the critical exponents were obtained with unprecedented precision.\nContrary to some previous reports, we confirmed that the majority-vote model on\nthe Archimedean lattices belongs to the two-dimensional Ising universality\nclass. It was shown that very precise determination of the critical noise is\nrequired to obtain proper values of the critical exponents.\n", "  Racah matrices and higher $j$-symbols are used in description of braiding\nproperties of conformal blocks and in construction of knot polynomials.\nHowever, in complicated cases the logic is actually inverted: they are much\nbetter deduced from these applications than from the basic representation\ntheory. Following the recent proposal of arXiv:1612.00422, we obtain the\nexclusive Racah matrix $\\bar S$ for the currently-front-line case of\nrepresentation $R=[3,1]$ with non-trivial multiplicities, where it is actually\noperator valued, i.e. depends on the choice of basises in the intertwiner\nspaces. Effective field theory for arborescent knots in this case possesses\ngauge invariance, which is not yet properly described and understood. Because\nof this lack of knowledge a big part (about a half) of $\\bar S$ needs to be\nreconstructed from orthogonality conditions. Therefore we discuss the abundance\nof symmetric orthogonal matrices, to which $\\bar S$ belong, and explain that\ndimension of their moduli space is also about a half of that for the ordinary\northogonal matrices. Thus the knowledge approximately matches the freedom and\nthis explains why the method can work -- with some limited addition of educated\nguesses. A similar calculation for $R=[r,1]$ for $r>3$ should also be doable.\n", "  A characteristic property of networks is their ability to propagate\ninfluences, such as infectious diseases, behavioral changes, and failures. An\nespecially important class of such contagious dynamics is that of cascading\nprocesses. These processes include, for example, cascading failures in\ninfrastructure systems, extinctions cascades in ecological networks, and\ninformation cascades in social systems. In this review, we discuss recent\nprogress and challenges associated with the modeling, prediction, detection,\nand control of cascades in networks.\n", "  We study the strong coupling between the molecular excited state and the\nplasmonic modes of silver hole arrays with a resonant frequency very close to\nthe asymptotic line of the plasmonic dispersion relation, at the nonlinear\nregime. We demonstrate that the strong coupling regime can be achieved between\nthe two sub-systems at low molecular densities with negligible damping of the\nelectromagnetic field. Our results are supported by rigorous numerical\nsimulations showing that the strong coupling is observed when the molecular\ntransition lies within the nonlinear regime of the dispersion relation rather\nthan the linear regime.\n", "  We examine the HI-to-stellar mass ratio (HI fraction) for galaxies near\nfilament backbones within the nearby Universe ($d <$ 181 Mpc). This work uses\nthe 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey and the Discrete Persistent Structures\nExtractor to define the filamentary structure of the local cosmic web. HI\nspectral stacking of HI Parkes all sky survey observations yields the HI\nfraction for filament galaxies and a field control sample. The HI fraction is\nmeasured for different stellar masses and fifth nearest neighbour projected\ndensities ($\\Sigma_{5}$) to disentangle what influences cold gas in galaxies.\nFor galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\\star}$) $<$ 11 M$_{\\odot}$ in\nprojected densities 0 $\\leq$ $\\Sigma_{5}$ $<$ 3 galaxies Mpc$^{-2}$, all HI\nfractions of galaxies near filaments are statistically indistinguishable from\nthe control sample. Galaxies with stellar masses log($M_{\\star}$) $\\geq$ 11\nM$_{\\odot}$ have a systematically higher HI fraction near filaments than the\ncontrol sample. The greatest difference is 0.75 dex, which is 5.5$\\sigma$\ndifference at mean projected densities of 1.45 galaxies Mpc$^{-2}$. We suggest\nthat this is evidence for massive galaxies accreting cold gas from the\nintrafilament medium that can replenish some HI gas. This supports cold mode\naccretion where filament galaxies with a large gravitational potential can draw\ngas from the large-scale structure.\n", "  It is a general challenge to design highly active or selective earth-abundant\nmetals for catalytic hydrogenation. Here, we demonstrated an effective\ncomputational approach based on inverse molecular design theory to\ndeterministically search for optimal binding sites on Cu (100) surface through\nthe doping of Fe and/or Zn, and a stable Zn-doped Cu (100) surface was found\nwith minimal binding energy to H-atoms. We analyze the electronic structure\ncause of the optimal binding sites using a new quantum chemistry method called\norbital-specific binding energy analysis. Compared to the 3d-orbitals of\nsurface Cu atoms, the 3d-orbitals of surface Zn-atoms show less binding energy\ncontribution and participation, and are much less influenced by the electronic\ncouplings of the media Cu atoms. Our study provides valuable green chemistry\ninsights on designing catalysts using earth-abundant metals, and may lead to\nthe development of novel Cu-based earth-abundant alloys for important catalytic\nhydrogenation applications such as lignin degradation or CO2 transformation.\n", "  Boundary plasma physics plays an important role in tokamak confinement, but\nis difficult to simulate in a gyrokinetic code due to the scale-inseparable\nnonlocal multi-physics in magnetic separatrix and open magnetic field geometry.\nNeutral particles are also an important part of the boundary plasma physics. In\nthe present paper, noble electrostatic gyrokinetic techniques to simulate the\nflux-driven, low-beta electrostatic boundary plasma is reported. Gyrokinetic\nions and drift-kinetic electrons are utilized without scale-separation between\nthe neoclassical and turbulence dynamics. It is found that the nonlinear\nintermittent turbulence is a natural gyrokinetic phenomenon in the boundary\nplasma in the vicinity of the magnetic separatrix surface and in the scrape-off\nlayer.\n", "  RZ Psc is a young Sun-like star, long associated with the UXor class of\nvariable stars, which is partially or wholly dimmed by dust clumps several\ntimes each year. The system has a bright and variable infrared excess, which\nhas been interpreted as evidence that the dimming events are the passage of\nasteroidal fragments in front of the host star. Here, we present a decade of\noptical photometry of RZ Psc and take a critical look at the asteroid belt\ninterpretation. We show that the distribution of light curve gradients is\nnon-uniform for deep events, which we interpret as possible evidence for an\nasteroidal fragment-like clump structure. However, the clumps are very likely\nseen above a high optical depth mid-plane, so the disk's bulk clumpiness is not\nrevealed. While circumstantial evidence suggests an asteroid belt is more\nplausible than a gas-rich transition disk, the evolutionary status remains\nuncertain. We suggest that the rarity of Sun-like stars showing disk-related\nvariability may arise because i) any accretion streams are transparent, and/or\nii) turbulence above the inner rim is normally shadowed by a flared outer disk.\n", "  We follow the passage from complex amplitude bistability to phase bistability\nin the driven dissipative Jaynes-Cummings oscillator. Quasidistribution\nfunctions in the steady state are employed, for varying qubit-cavity detuning\nand drive parameters, in order to track a first-order dissipative quantum phase\ntransition up to the critical point marking a second-order transition and\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. We demonstrate the photon blockade breakdown in\nthe dispersive regime, and find that the coexistence of cavity states in the\nregime of quantum bistability is accompanied by pronounced qubit-cavity\nentanglement. Focusing on the role of quantum fluctuations in the response of\nboth coupled quantum degrees of freedom (cavity and qubit), we move from a\nregion of minimal entanglement in the dispersive regime, where we derive\nanalytical perturbative results, to the threshold behaviour of spontaneous\ndressed-state polarization at resonance.\n", "  In the year 1900 Max Planck was led by experimental observations to propose a\nstrange formula for the intensity as a function of frequency for light emitted\nby a cavity. It relied on peculiar properties to be obeyed by the emitters and\nabsorbers in the cavity. I highlight the mathematically suggestive nature of\nthe formula, accessible even to a high school student, that could have provided\na clue to the physical reasoning of Planck. In 1905, Einstein made the bold\nphoton hypothesis and was able to predict the formula for the photoelectric\neffect which was not fully explored then. The first part of this article\nconcerns the period 1905 to 1923 with a possible explanation for the\ndifficulties in acceptance of the new concept. In the second part of the\narticle I present how S. N. Bose's 1924 paper provided a systematic derivation\nof Planck formula by consistently adopting the conception of photons within\nBoltzmann's framework. In conclusion we discuss the implications of Quantum\nMechanics that eventually emerged, showing that the seeds of some of its\nuncanny conceptual content were already foreshadowed in Einstein's proposal.\n", "  Multi-dimensional magnetic resonance spectroscopy is an important tool for\nstudying molecular structures, interactions and dynamics in bio-engineering.\nThe data acquisition time, however, is relatively long and non-uniform sampling\ncan be applied to reduce this time. To obtain the full spectrum,a\nreconstruction method with Vandermonde factorization is proposed.This method\nexplores the general signal property in magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Its\ntime domain signal is approximated by a sum of a few exponentials. Results on\nsynthetic and realistic data show that the new approach can achieve faithful\nspectrum reconstruction and outperforms state-of-the-art low rank Hankel matrix\nmethod.\n", "  The paper deals with the Bond Graph (BG) modeling and the model validation of\na brazed-plate heat exchanger. This device is an important part of a\nmechanically pumped cooling loop. A thermo hydraulic BG model is developed and\ncompared with experimental data. Optimization is performed to determine the\nbest value of the convection heat exchange coefficients to be fixed in the\nmodel.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate a connection between the roots of a certain\nsequence of orthogonal polynomials on the real line and the linear instability\nof a $x$-directionally homogeneous background velocity profile $u^b(x,y) =\n\\cos(y)$ in the quasi-geostrophic shallow water (QG) equation in a domain with\nperiodic boundaries in the $y$-direction. Using the relationship we establish,\nwe then prove that there exists a unique unstable mode for each horizontal wave\nnumber $0<k<1$ and provide mathematically rigorous estimates of the associated\ngrowth rate.\n", "  We present an observational study of the impacts of the interactions on the\nstellar population in a sample of galaxy pairs. Long-slit spectra in the\nwavelength range 3440-7300 {\\AA} obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object\nSpectrograph (GMOS) at Gemini South for fifteen galaxies in nine close pairs\nwere used. The spatial distributions of the stellar population contributions\nwere obtained using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. Taking\ninto account the different contributions to the emitted light, we found that\nmost of the galaxies in our sample are dominated by the young/intermediate\nstellar populations. This result differs from the one derived for isolated\ngalaxies where the old stellar population dominates the disc surface\nbrightness. We interpreted such different behavior as being due to the effect\nof gas inflows along the disk of interacting galaxies on the star formation in\na time scale of the order of about 2Gyr. We also found that, in general, the\nsecondary galaxy of the pairs has a higher contribution of the young stellar\npopulation than the primary one. We compared the estimated values of the\nstellar and nebular extinctions derived from the synthesis method and the\nH{\\alpha}/H\\b{eta} emission-line ratio finding that the nebular extinctions are\nsystematically higher than stellar ones by about a factor of 2. We did not find\nany correlation between nebular and stellar metallicities. We neither found a\ncorrelation between stellar metallicities and ages while a positive correlation\nbetween nebular metallicities and stellar ages was obtained, with the older\nregions being the most metal-rich.\n", "  In transition-metal compounds with partially filled $4d$ and $5d$ shells\nspin-orbit entanglement, electronic correlations, and crystal-field effects\nconspire to give rise to a variety of novel forms of topological quantum\nmatter. This includes Kitaev materials -- a family of spin-orbit assisted Mott\ninsulators, in which local, spin-orbit entangled $j=1/2$ moments form that are\nsubject to strong bond-directional interactions. On a conceptual level, Kitaev\nmaterials attract much interest for their unconventional forms of magnetism,\nsuch as spin liquid physics in two- and three-dimensional lattice geometries or\nthe formation of non-trivial spin textures. Experimentally, a number of Kitaev\nmaterials have been synthesized, which includes the honeycomb materials\nNa$_2$IrO$_3$, $\\alpha$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, the triangular materials\nBa$_3$Ir$_x$Ti$_{3-x}$O$_9$, as well as the three-dimensional hyper-honeycomb\nand stripy-honeycomb materials $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ and\n$\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$. These lecture notes provide a short review of the\ncurrent status of the theoretical and experimental exploration of these Kitaev\nmaterials.\n", "  Quantification of complexity in neurophysiological signals has been studied\nusing different methods, especially those from information or dynamical system\ntheory. These studies revealed the dependence on different states of\nconsciousness, particularly that wakefulness is characterized by larger\ncomplexity of brain signals perhaps due to the necessity of the brain to handle\nvaried sensorimotor information. Thus these frameworks are very useful in\nattempts at quantifying cognitive states. We set out to analyze different types\nof signals including scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG), and\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG) in subjects during different states of\nconsciousness: awake, sleep stages and epileptic seizures. The signals were\nanalyzed using a statistical (Permutation Entropy) and a deterministic\n(Permutation Lempel Ziv Complexity) analytical method. The results are\npresented in a complexity vs entropy graph, showing that the values of entropy\nand complexity of the signals tend to be greatest when the subjects are in\nfully alert states, falling in states with loss of awareness or consciousness.\nThese results are robust for all three types of recordings. We propose that the\ninvestigation of the structure of cognition using the frameworks of complexity\nwill reveal mechanistic aspects of brain dynamics associated not only with\naltered states of consciousness but also with normal and pathological\nconditions.\n", "  Within the framework of self-adjoint operator of time in non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics some properties of solutions of Schroedinger equation,\nrelated to Hilbert space formalism, are investigated for two types of time\ndependent Hamiltonian.\n", "  Combining ab initio calculations and effective models derived from them, we\ndiscuss the electronic structure of oxygen doped gold chains when one Au atom\nis replaced by any transition-metal atom of the $3d$ series. The effect of O\ndoping is to bring extended Au $5d_{xz}$ and $5d_{yz}$ states to the Fermi\nlevel, which together with the Au states of zero angular momentum projection,\nlead to three possible channels for the screening of the magnetism of the\nimpurity. For most 3d impurities the expected physics is similar to that of the\nunderscreened Kondo model, with singular Fermi liquid behavior. For Fe and Co\nunder a tetragonal crystal field introduced by leads, the system might display\na non-Fermi liquid behavior. Ni and Cu impurities are described by a $S = 1$\ntwo channel Kondo model and an SU(4) impurity Anderson model in the\nintermediate valence regime, respectively. In both cases, the system is a Fermi\nliquid, but the conductance shows some observable differences with the ordinary\nSU(2) Anderson model.\n", "  EUSO-TA is a pathfinder experiment for the space based JEM-EUSO mission for\nthe detection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. EUSO-TA is an high-resolution\nfluorescence telescope installed in front of the Black Rock Mesa fluorescence\ndetectors of the Telescope Array (TA) experiment, in Utah (USA). At the TA\nsite, a Central Laser Facility is installed for calibration purposes, since it\nemits laser beams with known energy and geometry. EUSO-TA consists of two 1\n$\\mbox{m}^2$ Fresnel lenses, with a field of view of 10.5{\\deg} that focus the\nlight on a Photo Detector Module (PDM). The PDM currently consists of 36\nHamamatsu Multi-Anode Photo-Multipliers Tubes (MAPMTs) with 64 channels each.\nFront-end readout is performed by 36 ASICS, with two FPGA boards that send the\ndata to a CPU and a storage system. The detector was installed in February\n2015. Tests using the mentioned light sources have been performed and\nobservations of cosmic ray events, as well as those of stars with different\nmagnitude and color index have been done. The data acquisition is triggered by\nTA fluorescence detectors, although a self-trigger algorithm is currently in\nthe last phases of development and test. With TA, thanks to its large field of\nview and the surface detectors, the cosmic ray shower events are reconstructed\nand the parameters are used to perform simulations of the response of EUSO-TA\ndetector using EUSO-Offline. Simulations of the detected events are compared\nwith data and the results are shown in this work.\n", "  In part I of this paper, I proposed a new set of equations, which I refer to\nas the M(D,{\\eta})-formulation and which differs from the Navier-Stokes-Fourier\ndescription of fluid motion. Here, I use these equations to model several\nclassic examples in fluid mechanics, with the intention of providing a general\nsense of comparison between the two approaches. A few broad facts emerge: (1)\nit is as simple--or in most cases, much simpler--to find solutions with the\nM(D,{\\eta})-formulation, (2) for some examples, there is not much of a\ndifference in predictions--in fact, for sound propagation and for examples in\nwhich there is only a rotational part of the velocity, my transport\ncoefficients D and {\\eta} are chosen to match Navier-Stokes-Fourier solutions\nin the appropriate regimes, (3) there are, however, examples in which\npronounced differences in predictions appear, such as light scattering, and (4)\nthere arise, moreover, important conceptual differences, as seen in examples\nlike sound at a non-infinite impedance boundary, thermophoresis, and gravity's\neffect on the atmosphere.\n", "  Over short time intervals planetary ephemerides have been traditionally\nrepresented in analytical form as finite sums of periodic terms or sums of\nPoisson terms that are periodic terms with polynomial amplitudes. Nevertheless,\nthis representation is not well adapted for the evolution of the planetary\norbits in the solar system over million of years as they present drifts in\ntheir main frequencies, due to the chaotic nature of their dynamics. The aim of\nthe present paper is to develop a numerical algorithm for slowly diffusing\nsolutions of a perturbed integrable Hamiltonian system that will apply to the\nrepresentation of the chaotic planetary motions with varying frequencies. By\nsimple analytical considerations, we first argue that it is possible to recover\nexactly a single varying frequency. Then, a function basis involving\ntime-dependent fundamental frequencies is formulated in a semi-analytical way.\nFinally, starting from a numerical solution, a recursive algorithm is used to\nnumerically decompose the solution on the significant elements of the function\nbasis. Simple examples show that this algorithm can be used to give compact\nrepresentations of different types of slowly diffusing solutions. As a test\nexample, we show how this algorithm can be successfully applied to obtain a\nvery compact approximation of the La2004 solution of the orbital motion of the\nEarth over 40 Myr ([-35Myr,5Myr]). This example has been chosen as this\nsolution is widely used for the reconstruction of the climates of the past.\n", "  We proposed a construction of the Schroedinger functional scheme for the\nMoebius domain wall fermions (MDWF) by introducing a proper boundary operator\nto the original MDWF in the last conference. The spectrum of the effective\nfour-dimensional operator was investigated. This year we investigate the\nfermionic contribution to the beta-function with the Moebius domain wall\nfermion with the SF boundary term up to the one-loop level and find that our\nconstruction properly reproduce the one-loop beta-function.\n", "  We report the calculated fundamental band gaps of \\emph{wurtzite} ternary\nalloys Zn$_{1-x}$M$_x$O (M=Mg, Cd) and the band offsets of the\nZnO/Zn$_{1-x}$M$_x$O heterojunctions, these II-VI materials are important for\nelectronics and optoelectronics. Our calculation is based on density functional\ntheory within the linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) approach where the modified\nBecke-Johnson (MBJ) semi-local exchange is used to accurately produce the band\ngaps, and the coherent potential approximation (CPA) is applied to deal with\nconfigurational average for the ternary alloys. The combined LMTO-MBJ-CPA\napproach allows one to simultaneously determine both the conduction band and\nvalence band offsets of the heterojunctions. The calculated band gap data of\nthe ZnO alloys scale as $E_g=3.35+2.33x$ and $E_g=3.36-2.33x+1.77x^2$ for\nZn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$O and Zn$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$O, respectively, where $x$ being the\nimpurity concentration. These scaling as well as the composition dependent band\noffsets are quantitatively compared to the available experimental data. The\ncapability of predicting the band parameters and band alignments of ZnO and its\nternary alloys with the LMTO-CPA-MBJ approach indicate the promising\napplication of this method in the design of emerging electronics and\noptoelectronics.\n", "  The Belle II experiment is under construction at the KEK laboratory in Japan.\nBelle II will study e+e- collisions at or near the Upsilon(4S) resonance with\nthe goal of collecting 50 ab-1 of data, which is a large increase over that\nrecorded by the Belle and BaBar experiments. This data will provide a large\nsample of charm meson decays, and Belle II will have a very active charm\nphysics program. Here we discuss some highlights of this program, focusing on\nmeasurements of mixing, CP violation, and leptonic decays.\n", "  Variational analysis techniques in lattice QCD are powerful tools that give\naccess to the excited state spectrum of QCD. At zero momentum, these techniques\nare well established and can cleanly isolate energy eigenstates of either\npositive or negative parity. In order to compute the form factors of a single\nenergy eigenstate, we must perform a variational analysis at non-zero momentum.\nWhen we do this with baryons, we run into issues with parity mixing, as boosted\nbaryons are not eigenstates of parity. The parity-expanded variational analysis\n(PEVA) technique is a novel method for ensuring the successful and consistent\nisolation of boosted baryon eigenstates. This is achieved through a parity\nexpansion of the operator basis used to construct the correlation matrix.\nWorld-first calculations of excited state nucleon form factors using this new\ntechnique are presented, showing the improvement over conventional methods.\n", "  In the current study easy method to synthesize C12A7 particles with cubic\nmorphology was investigated for the application of Transparent Conducting Oxide\nlayer in thinfilm solar cell. By self-combustion method with proper amount of\nurea addition, cubic and foamy structures of C12A7 were achieved at 950 {\\deg}C\nand at 510 {\\deg}C respectively. Pure C12A7 formation confirmed by P-XRD and\ngrowth mechanism of the cubes was also understood by SEM and FT-IR analysis.\nFurther the band gap was measured 3.07 eV in case of 510 {\\deg}C and 3.32 eV in\ncase of 950 {\\deg}C synthesized particles with the help of UV-Vis analysis.\nDuring PL single sharp peaks at 399 nm noticed which indicates less defective\nC12A7 at 950 {\\deg}C, confirmed by XRD having more crystallinity and less\nstrain. No trap state or radiative recombination observed in case of C12A7\nsynthesized at 950 {\\deg}C sample. Conductivity from conductometry titration\nmethod was found to be 9.223 mS at 26.3 {\\deg}C and 747.33 mS at 26.4 {\\deg}C\nfor 510 {\\deg}C and 950 {\\deg}C synthesized samples respectively.\n", "  Szilard engine(SZE) is one of the best example of how information can be used\nto extract work from a system. Initially, the working substance of SZE was\nconsidered to be a single particle. Later on, researchers has extended the\nstudies of SZE to multi-particle systems and even to quantum regime. Here we\npresent a detailed study of classical SZE consisting of $N$ particles with\ninter-particle interactions, i.e., the working substance is a low density\nnon-ideal gas and compare the work extraction with respect to SZE with\nnon-interacting multi particle system as working substance. We have considered\ntwo cases of interactions namely: (i) hard core interactions and (ii) square\nwell interaction. Our study reveals that work extraction is less when more\nparticles are interacting through hard core interactions. More work is\nextracted when the particles are interacting via square well interaction.\nAnother important result for the second case is that as we increase the\nparticle number the work extraction becomes independent of the initial position\nof the partition, as opposed to the first case. Work extraction depends\ncrucially on the initial position of the partition. More work can be extracted\nwith larger number of particles when partition is inserted at positions near\nthe boundary walls.\n", "  We prove that the \"generic condition\" used in singularity theorems of general\nrelativity is generic in the space of Lorentzian metrics on a given manifold,\nin the sense that it is satisfied for all metrics in a residual set in the\nWhitney $C^k$-topology, for $k$ depending on the dimension of the manifold.\n", "  In this paper we study Lagrangian tori in ${\\mathbb C}P^2$. A two-dimensional\nperiodic Schr\\\"odinger operator is associated with every Lagrangian torus in\n${\\mathbb C}P^2$. We introduce an energy functional for tori as an integral of\nthe potential of the Schr\\\"odinger operators, which has a natural geometrical\nmeaning. We study the energy functional on two families of Lagrangian tori and\npropose a conjecture that the minimum of the functional is achieved by the\nClifford torus. We also study deformations of minimal Lagrangian tori. In\nparticular we show that if the deformation preserves a conformal type of the\ntorus, then it also preserves the area of the torus. Thus it follows that\ndeformations generated by Novikov-Veselov equations preserve the area of\nminimal Lagrangian tori.\n", "  Thermal gradients induce concentration gradients in alkali halide solutions,\nand the salt migrates towards hot or cold regions depending on the average\ntemperature of the solution. This effect has been interpreted using the heat of\ntransport, which provides a route to rationalize thermophoretic phenomena.\nEarly theories provide estimates of the heat of transport at infinite dilution.\nThese values are used to interpret thermodiffusion (Soret) and thermoelectric\n(Seebeck) effects. However, accessing heats of transport of individual ions at\nfinite concentration remains an outstanding question both theoretically and\nexperimentally. Here we discuss a computational approach to calculate heats of\ntransport of aqueous solutions at finite concentrations, and apply our method\nto study lithium chloride solutions at concentrations $>0.5$~M. The heats of\ntransport are significantly different for Li$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions, unlike what\nis expected at infinite dilution. We find theoretical evidence for the\nexistence of minima in the Soret coefficient of LiCl, where the magnitude of\nthe heat of transport is maximized. The Seebeck coefficient obtained from the\nionic heats of transport varies significantly with temperature and\nconcentration. We identify thermodynamic conditions leading to a maximization\nof the thermoelectric response of aqueous solutions.\n", "  It has been claimed that in a test of an asymptotically AdS version of weak\ncosmic censorship conjecture by attempting to overspin a BTZ black hole with\ntest particles, one finds that it is not possible to spin-up the black hole\npast its extremal limit. The result of this analysis is restricted to the case\nwhere the initial black hole is extremal. We extend this analysis to find that\nmassive test particles can overspin the black hole, if we start with a nearly\nextremal black hole, instead. We also consider the interaction of the BTZ black\nhole with test fields. We show that overspinning of nearly extremal black holes\nis possible whether or not there is superradiance for the field. If there is\nsuperradiance, overspinning occurs in a narrow range of frequencies bounded\nbelow by the super-radiant limit. However, if there is no superradiance for the\nfield, overspinning becomes generic and also applies to extremal black holes.\nThis is in analogy with the Kerr case.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) permits information-theoretically secure\ntransmission of digital encryption keys, assuming that the behaviour of the\ndevices employed for the key exchange can be reliably modelled and predicted.\nRemarkably, no assumptions have to be made on the capabilities of an\neavesdropper other than that she is bounded by the laws of Nature, thus making\nthe security of QKD \"unconditional\". However, unconditional security is hard to\nachieve in practice. For example, any experimental realisation can only collect\nfinite data samples, leading to vulnerabilities against coherent attacks, the\nmost general class of attacks, and for some protocols the theoretical proof of\nrobustness against these attacks is still missing. For these reasons, in the\npast many QKD experiments have fallen short of implementing an unconditionally\nsecure protocol and have instead considered limited attacking capabilities by\nthe eavesdropper. Here, we explore the security of QKD against coherent attacks\nin the most challenging environment: the long-distance transmission of keys. We\ndemonstrate that the BB84 protocol can provide positive key rates for distances\nup to 240 km without multiplexing of conventional signals, and up to 200 km\nwith multiplexing. Useful key rates can be achieved even for the longest\ndistances, using practical thermo-electrically cooled single-photon detectors.\n", "  We use spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) combined\nwith polarization-variable laser and investigate the spin-orbit coupling effect\nunder interband hybridization of Rashba spin-split states for the surface\nalloys Bi/Ag(111) and Bi/Cu(111). In addition to the conventional band mapping\nof photoemission for Rashba spin-splitting, the different orbital and spin\nparts of the surface wavefucntion are directly imaged into energy-momentum\nspace. It is unambiguously revealed that the interband spin-orbit coupling\nmodifies the spin and orbital character of the Rashba surface states leading to\nthe enriched spin-orbital entanglement and the pronounced momentum dependence\nof the spin-polarization. The hybridization thus strongly deviates the spin and\norbital characters from the standard Rashba model. The complex spin texture\nunder interband spin-orbit hybridyzation proposed by first-principles\ncalculation is experimentally unraveled by SARPES with a combination of p- and\ns-polarized light.\n", "  The electromagnetic induction equation (Helmholtz equation) for the\nelectrically conducting Earth is generalised to the inclusion of a spatially\nfluctuating internal conductivity spectrum that is superimposed on a\none-dimensional large-scale conductivity reference-profile which depends solely\non the vertical coordinate z>0. This large-scale profile is assumed to be\nknown. The distribution of the fluctuations is allowed to be arbitrary. The\nconductivity-fluctuation generalised Helmholtz equation depends on the spectral\ndensity of the fluctuations as function of the vertical and horizontal\ncoordinates. Application to the inverse geomagnetic/magneto-telluric problem is\ndiscussed. We show analytically that the inverse problem yields the\nconductivity fluctuation spectrum. The relation between the spectral density\nand the obtained conductivity profile is given.\n", "  Cosmic rays originating from extraterrestrial sources are permanently\narriving at Earth atmosphere, where they produce up to billions of secondary\nparticles. The analysis of the secondary particles reaching to the surface of\nthe Earth may provide a very valuable information about the Sun activity,\nchanges in the geomagnetic field and the atmosphere, among others. In this\narticle, we present the first preliminary results of the analysis of the cosmic\nrays measured with a high resolution tracking detector, TRAGALDABAS, located at\nthe Univ. of Santiago de Compostela, in Spain.\n", "  The fact that repeated projective measurements can slow down (the Zeno\neffect) or speed up (the anti-Zeno effect) quantum evolution is well-known.\nHowever, to date, studies of these effects focus on quantum systems that are\nweakly interacting with their environment. In this paper, we investigate what\nhappens to a quantum system under the action of repeated measurements if the\nquantum system is strongly interacting with its environment. We consider as the\nquantum system a single two-level system coupled strongly to a collection of\nharmonic oscillators. A so-called polaron transformation is then used to make\nthe problem in the strong system-environment coupling regime tractable. We find\nthat the strong coupling case exhibits quantitative and qualitative differences\nas compared with the weak coupling case. In particular, the effective decay\nrate does not depend linearly on the spectral density of the environment. This\nthen means that, in the strong coupling regime that we investigate, increasing\nthe system-environment coupling strength can actually decrease the effective\ndecay rate. We also consider a collection of two-level atoms coupled strongly\nwith a common environment. In this case, we find that there are further\ndifferences between the weak and strong coupling cases since the two-level\natoms can now indirectly interact with one another due to the common\nenvironment.\n", "  Recent reports claiming tentative association of the massive star binary\nsystem gamma^2 Velorum (WR 11) with a high-energy gamma-ray source observed by\nFermi-LAT contrast the so-far exclusive role of Eta Carinae as the hitherto\nonly detected gamma-ray emitter in the source class of particle-accelerating\ncolliding-wind binary systems. We aim to shed light on this claim of\nassociation by providing dedicated model predictions for the nonthermal photon\nemission spectrum of WR 11. We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic\nmodeling to trace the structure and conditions of the wind-collision region of\nWR 11 throughout its 78.5 day orbit, including the important effect of\nradiative braking in the stellar winds. A transport equation is then solved in\nthe wind-collision region to determine the population of relativistic electrons\nand protons which are subsequently used to compute nonthermal photon emission\ncomponents. We find that - if WR 11 be indeed confirmed as the responsible\nobject for the observed gamma-ray emission - its radiation will unavoidably be\nof hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation fields in the binary system\nwhich inhibit the acceleration of electrons to energies suffciently high for\nobservable inverse Compton radiation. Different conditions in wind-collision\nregion near the apastron and periastron configuration lead to significant\nvariability on orbital time scales. The bulk of the hadronic gamma-ray emission\noriginates at a 400 solar radii wide region at the apex.\n", "  The Picard code for the numerical solution of the Galactic cosmic ray\npropagation problem allows for high-resolution models that acknowledge the 3D\nstructure of our Galaxy. Picard was used to determine diffuse gamma-ray\nemission of the Galaxy over the energy range from 100 MeV to 100 TeV. We\ndiscuss the impact of a cosmic-ray source distribution aligned with the\nGalactic spiral arms for a range of such spiral-arm models. As expected, the\nimpact on the gamma-ray emission is most distinct in the inverse-Compton\nchannel, where imprints of the spiral arms are visible and yield predictions\nthat are no longer symmetric to the rotational axis of the Milkyway. We will\nillustrate these differences by a direct comparison to results from previous\naxially symmetric Galactic propagation models: we find differences in the\ngamma-ray flux both on global scales and on local scales related to the spiral\narm tangents. We compare gamma-ray flux and spectra at on-arm vs. off-arm\nprojections and characterize the differences to axially symmetric models.\n", "  An important contribution to the gamma-ray emission of our Galaxy is the\nGalactic Diffuse emission. We present specific developments within the PICARD\ncode for modeling of Galactic cosmic ray propagation that are relevant for the\ncomputation of the gamma-ray emission to accommodate a new Interstellar\nRadiation Field (ISRF) model. We study the differences of the individual ISRF\nmodels on Galactic Diffuse gamma-ray emission predictions in the GeV to the TeV\nenergy regime. Emphasis was laid on obtaining robust predictions for observable\nsignatures in the very high energy gamma-ray regime with a special attention to\nthe energy regime for H.E.S.S. Preliminary longitude-latitude profile and\nresiduum maps of inverse Compton emissions are shown for axisymmetric and\nfour-arm spiral Galaxy models.\n", "  The interaction between the strong winds of the stars in colliding-wind\nbinary (CWB) systems produces two shock fronts, delimiting the wind collision\nregion (WCR). There, particles are expected to be accelerated mainly via\ndiffusive shock acceleration, and to produce $\\gamma$-rays, in processes\ninvolving relativistic electrons and/or protons. We investigate the injection\nand the acceleration of protons in typical CWB systems by means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations, with a test-particle approach. We use magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations to determine the background conditions in the wind collision\nregion. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both shocks, on\neither side of the WCR, with a self-consistently determined large-scale\nmagnetic field, which has an impact on the shape of the WCR, and the topology\nof which plays an important role in particle acceleration at collisionless\nshocks. Such studies may contribute to improve $\\gamma$-ray flux predictions\nfor CWB systems.\n", "  In this article we present a new diagnostic approach utilizing flow-cytometry\nto study compounds of nanoparticle samples in solution by analysis of their\nscattering patterns retrieved from the cytometric measurements. As a specific\nenhancement of this technique we study as well the scattering pattern of\nnanoparticles in a fluorescent solution (529 nm). A significant enhancement of\nthe cytometry measurements is observed supporting an improved separation of\nparticle formations that are clearly resolved in the cytograms. The samples in\nthis experiment are prepared from 80 nm citrate-capped gold nanoparticles\n(AuNP). They are stabilized providing 2-(dimethylamino)ethanol (DMAE) in the\naqueous solution. A laser diode with a wavelength of 488 nm is used as\nfundamental illumination for the flow-cytometry measurements (FCM). Dynamic\nLight Scattering (DLS) measurements are performed separately and demonstrate a\nvery good agreement with the Flow-Cytometry measurements both of which allow to\ngive an effective size calibration. For further analysis light transport\nsimulations are presented. They provide information on the key-process to form\nthe correlation of the fluorescent solutions FCM to the studied particles of\ninterest. From this we extract the volume nature of the scattering process\nensuring the correlation.\n", "  The thermal boundary resistance (Kapitza resistance) of (001) twist grain\nboundaries in silicon nanowires depends on the mismatch angle. This dependence\nis systematically investigated by means of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Grain boundary systems with and without coincidence site lattice\nare compared. The Kapitza resistance increases with twist angle up to 40{\\deg}.\nFor larger angles, it varies only little around 1.56 $\\pm$ 0.05 K m^2/GW,\nexcept for a drop by 30% near the 90{\\deg} {\\Sigma} 1 grain boundary. Finite\nsize effects due to the fixed outer boundary conditions of the nanowire are\nnegligible for diameters larger than 25 nm.\n", "  Precision measurements by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on the\nInternational Space Station of the primary cosmic-ray electron flux and the\npositron flux will be discussed. The electron flux and the positron flux each\nrequire a description beyond a single power-law spectrum. Both the electron\nflux and the positron flux change their behavior at ~30 GeV but the fluxes are\nsignificantly different in their magnitude and energy dependence. Between 20\nand 200 GeV the positron spectral index is significantly harder than the\nelectron spectral index. The determination of the different behavior of the\nspectral indices versus energy is a new observation and provides important\ninformation on the origins of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons.\n", "  We study a new model of interactive particle systems which we call the\nrandomly activated cascading exclusion process (RACEP). Particles wake up\naccording to exponential clocks and then take a geometric number of steps. If\nanother particle is encountered during these steps, the first particle goes to\nsleep at that location and the second is activated and proceeds accordingly. We\nconsider a totally asymmetric version of this model which we refer as\nHall-Littlewood-PushTASEP (HL-PushTASEP) on $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$ lattice where\nparticles only move right and where initially particles are distributed\naccording to Bernoulli product measure on $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$. We prove\nKPZ-class limit theorems for the height function fluctuations. Under a\nparticular weak scaling, we also prove convergence to the solution of the KPZ\nequation.\n", "  We explore the dynamical consequences of switching the coupling form in a\nsystem of coupled oscillators. We consider two types of switching, one where\nthe coupling function changes periodically and one where it changes\nprobabilistically. We find, through bifurcation diagrams and Basin Stability\nanalysis, that there exists a window in coupling strength where the\noscillations get suppressed. Beyond this window, the oscillations are revived\nagain. A similar trend emerges with respect to the relative predominance of the\ncoupling forms, with the largest window of fixed point dynamics arising where\nthere is balance in the probability of occurrence of the coupling forms.\nFurther, significantly, more rapid switching of coupling forms yields large\nregions of oscillation suppression. Lastly, we propose an effective model for\nthe dynamics arising from switched coupling forms and demonstrate how this\nmodel captures the basic features observed in numerical simulations and also\noffers an accurate estimate of the fixed point region through linear stability\nanalysis.\n", "  Electrostatic hexapoles are revealed as a powerful tool in the rotational\nstate-selection and alignment of molecules to be utilized in beam experiments\non collisional and photoinitiated processes. In the paper, we report results on\nthe application of the hexapolar technique on the recently studied chiral\nmolecules propylene oxide, 2-butanol and 2bromobutane, to be investigated in\nselective photodissociation and enantiomeric discrimination.\n", "  Experimental results of the $^{237}$Np($d, p \\gamma)^{238}$Np reaction are\npresented, which verifies the generalized Brink-Axel (gBA) hypothesis for\n$\\gamma$ transitions between states in the quasi-continuum. The gBA hypothesis\nholds not only for specific collective resonances, but for the full dipole\nstrength below the neutron separation energy. We discuss the validity of the\ngBA hypothesis also for lighter systems like $^{92}$Zr where the concept of a\nunique $\\gamma$-ray strength function ($\\gamma$SF) is problematic due to large\nPorter-Thomas fluctuations. Methods for studying the $\\gamma$SF and the\nfluctuations as function of excitation energy are presented.\n", "  In this Letter, we report on the gravitational wave signal computed in the\ncontext of an $ab$ $initio$, three-dimensional simulation of a core collapse\nsupernova explosion, beginning with a 15M$_\\odot$ star and using\nstate-of-the-art weak interactions. The simulation was performed with our\nneutrino hydrodynamics code Chimera. We discuss the potential for detection of\nour predicted gravitational signal by the current generation of gravitational\nwave detectors.\n", "  The calculated linear gain in relativistic strophotron is averaged over\nelectron distribution. It is shown, that after averaging resonance peaks remain\nin amplification spectrum. The nonresonant background gives only negligibly\nsmall contribution to the gain.\n", "  Networks are powerful instruments to study complex phenomena, but they become\nhard to analyze in data that contain noise. Network backbones provide a tool to\nextract the latent structure from noisy networks by pruning non-salient edges.\nWe describe a new approach to extract such backbones. We assume that edge\nweights are drawn from a binomial distribution, and estimate the error-variance\nin edge weights using a Bayesian framework. Our approach uses a more realistic\nnull model for the edge weight creation process than prior work. In particular,\nit simultaneously considers the propensity of nodes to send and receive\nconnections, whereas previous approaches only considered nodes as emitters of\nedges. We test our model with real world networks of different types (flows,\nstocks, co-occurrences, directed, undirected) and show that our Noise-Corrected\napproach returns backbones that outperform other approaches on a number of\ncriteria. Our approach is scalable, able to deal with networks with millions of\nedges.\n", "  In this paper we quantify the performances of an automated weather forecast\nsystem implemented on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) site at Mt. Graham\n(Arizona) in forecasting the main atmospheric parameters close to the ground.\nThe system employs a mesoscale non-hydrostatic numerical model (Meso-Nh). To\nvalidate the model we compare the forecasts of wind speed, wind direction,\ntemperature and relative humidity close to the ground with the respective\nvalues measured by instrumentation installed on the telescope dome. The study\nis performed over a large sample of nights uniformly distributed over two\nyears. The quantitative analysis is done using classical statistical operators\n(bias, RMSE and $\\sigma$) and contingency tables, which allows to extract\ncomplementary key information, such as the percentage of correct detection (PC)\nand the probability to obtain a correct detection within a defined interval of\nvalues (POD). Results of our study indicate that the model performances in\nforecasting the atmospheric parameters we have just cited are very good, in\nsome cases excellent: RMSE for temperature is below 1{\\deg} C, for relative\nhumidity is 14%, for the wind speed is around 2.5m/s. The relative error of the\nRMSE for wind direction varies from 9% to 17% depending on the wind speed\nconditions. This work is performed in the context of ALTA (Advanced LBT\nTurbulence and Atmosphere) Center project, which final goal is to provide\nforecasts of all the atmospheric parameters and the optical turbulence to\nsupport LBT observations, adaptive optics facilities and interferometric\nfacilities.\n", "  This report documents the implementation of several related 1D heat flow\nproblems in the verification package ExactPack. In particular, the planar\nsandwich class defined by Dawes et al., as well as the classes\nPlanarSandwichHot, PlanarSandwichHalf, and other generalizations of the planar\nsandwich problem, are defined and documented here. A rather general treatment\nof 1D heat flow is presented, whose main results have been implemented in the\nclass Rod1D. All planar sandwich classes are derived from the parent class\nRod1D.\n", "  In this paper, we use a three flavor non-local Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL)\nmodel, an~improved effective model of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at low\nenergies, to investigate the existence of deconfined quarks in the cores of\nneutron stars. Particular emphasis is put on the possible existence of quark\nmatter in the cores of rotating neutron stars (pulsars). In contrast to\nnon-rotating neutron stars, whose particle compositions do not change with time\n(are frozen in), the type and structure of the matter in the cores of rotating\nneutron stars depends on the spin frequencies of these stars, which opens up a\npossible new window on the nature of matter deep in the cores of neutron stars.\nOur study shows that, depending on mass and rotational frequency, up to around\n8% of the mass of a massive neutron star may be in the mixed quark-hadron\nphase, if the phase transition is treated as a Gibbs transition. We also find\nthat the gravitational mass at which quark deconfinement occurs in rotating\nneutron stars varies quadratically with spin frequency, which can be fitted by\na simple formula.\n", "  We investigate the scattering problem of a two-particle composite system on a\ndelta-function potential. Using the time independent scattering theory, we\nstudy how the transmission/reflection coefficients change with the height of\nexternal potential, the incident momentum, and the strength of internal\npotential. In particular, we show that the existence of internal degree of\nfreedom can significantly change the transmission/reflection coefficients even\nwithout internal excitation. We consider two scenarios: the internal degree of\nfreedom of the incident wave is set to be in a state with even parity or odd\nparity, we find that the influence of a symmetric Hamiltonian is greater on the\nodd-parity internal states than on the even-parity ones.\n", "  We investigate possible links between the large-scale and small-scale\nfeatures of solar wind fluctuations across the frequency break separating fluid\nand kinetic regimes. The aim is to correlate the magnetic field fluctuations\npolarization at dissipative scales with the particular state of turbulence\nwithin the inertial range of fluctuations. We found clear correlations between\neach type of polarization within the kinetic regime and fluid parameters within\nthe inertial range. Moreover, for the first time in literature, we showed that\nleft-handed and right-handed polarized fluctuations occupy different areas of\nthe plasma instabilities-temperature anisotropy plot, as expected for\nAlfv$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$n Ion Cyclotron and Kinetic Alfv$\\acute{\\textrm{e}}$n\nwaves, respectively.\n", "  This is a photographic dataset collected for testing image processing\nalgorithms. The idea is to have images that can exploit the properties of total\nvariation, therefore a set of playing cards was distributed on the scene. The\ndataset is made available at www.fips.fi/photographic_dataset2.php\n", "  A random walk scheme, consisting of alternating phases of regular Brownian\nmotion and L\\'evy walks, is proposed as a model for run-and-tumble bacterial\nmotion. Within the continuous-time random walk approach we obtain the long-time\nand short-time behavior of the mean squared displacement of the walker as\ndepending on the properties of dwelling time distribution in each phase.\nDepending on these distributions, normal diffusion, superdiffusion and\nballistic spreading may arise.\n", "  Carbon nanostructures are promising ballistic protection materials, due to\ntheir low density and excellent mechanical properties. Recent experimental and\ncomputational investigations on the behavior of graphene under impact\nconditions revealed exceptional energy absorption properties as well. However,\nthe reported numerical and experimental values differ by an order of magnitude.\nIn this work, we combined numerical and analytical modeling to address this\nissue. In the numerical part, we employed reactive molecular dynamics to carry\nout ballistic tests on single and double-layered graphene sheets. We used\nvelocity values within the range tested in experiments. Our numerical and the\nexperimental results were used to determine parameters for a scaling law, which\nis in good agreement with all experimental and simulation results. We find that\nthe specific penetration energy decreases as the number of layers (N)\nincreases, from ~25 MJ/kg for N=1 to ~0.26 MJ/kg as N goes to infinity. These\nscale effects explain the apparent discrepancy between simulations and\nexperiments.\n", "  We investigate the exclusive semileptonic decays $J/\\psi \\to D_{(s)}^{(*)-}\n{\\ell}^+ \\nu_{\\ell}$, where $\\ell=e,\\mu$, within the Standard Model. The\nrelevant transition form factors are calculated in the framework of a\nrelativistic constituent quark model with built-in infrared confinement. Our\ncalculations predict the branching fractions $\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi \\to\nD_{(s)}^{(*)-} {\\ell}^+ \\nu_{\\ell})$ to be of the order of $10^{-10}$ for\n$D_s^{(*)-}$ and $10^{-11}$ for $D^{(*)-}$. Most of our numerical results are\nconsistent with other theoretical studies. However, some branching fractions\nare larger than those calculated in QCD sum rules approaches but smaller than\nthose obtained in the covariant light-front quark model by a factor of about\n$2-3$.\n", "  Many-body interactions can produce novel ground states in a condensed-matter\nsystem. For example, interacting electrons and holes can spontaneously form\nexcitons, a neutral bound state, provided that the exciton binding energy\nexceeds the energy separation between the single particle states. Here we\nreport on electrical transport measurements on spatially separated\ntwo-dimensional electron and hole gases with nominally degenerate energy\nsubbands, realized in an InAs(10 nm)/GaSb(5 nm) coupled quantum well. We\nobserve a narrow and intense maximum (~500 k\\Omega) in the four-terminal\nresistivity in the charge neutrality region, separating the electron-like and\nhole-like regimes, with a strong activated temperature-dependence above T = 7 K\nand perfect stability against quantizing magnetic fields. By quantitatively\ncomparing our data with early theoretical predictions, we show that such\nunexpectedly large resistance in our nominally zero-gap semi-metal system is\nprobably due to the formation of an excitonic insulator state.\n", "  Social conventions govern countless behaviors all of us engage in every day,\nfrom how we greet each other to the languages we speak. But how can shared\nconventions emerge spontaneously in the absence of a central coordinating\nauthority? The Naming Game model shows that networks of locally interacting\nindividuals can spontaneously self-organize to produce global coordination.\nHere, we provide a gentle introduction to the main features of the model, from\nthe dynamics observed in homogeneously mixing populations to the role played by\nmore complex social networks, and to how slight modifications of the basic\ninteraction rules give origin to a richer phenomenology in which more\nconventions can co-exist indefinitely.\n", "  The reproducibility of experiments is one of the main principles of the\nscientific method. However, numerical N-body experiments, especially those of\nplanetary systems, are currently not reproducible. In the most optimistic\nscenario, they can only be replicated in an approximate or statistical sense.\nEven if authors share their full source code and initial conditions,\ndifferences in compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware often lead\nto qualitatively different results.\n  We provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools that address the above\nissues, allowing for exact (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body experiments.\nIn addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that\nour framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyze these\nsimulations. As an example, we present a high-accuracy integration of the Solar\nSystem spanning 10Gyrs, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our\nframework we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals\nfor which we save snapshots, but at any time during the integration. We achieve\nthis by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from\nthe nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any\npoint in the saved simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds rather\nthan weeks.\n  We believe that the tools we present in this paper offer a new paradigm for\nhow N-body simulations are run, analyzed, and shared across the community.\n", "  Starting from the standard and commonly used relativistic nucleon wave\nfunction, we show that residual interactions based on gluon or Goldstone boson\nexchanges generate additional components leading to configuration mixing. This\nresult suggests that realistic nucleon wave functions can be expected to be far\nmore complex than seemingly successful form factor fits in relativistic quark\nmodels would have one believe.\n", "  There are countless examples in the history of science that not only were the\nlaws of physics often incomplete and more limited in their domain of validity\nthan was realized, but at times they missed the mark completely. Despite this,\nour collective memory is often short on such matters, focusing on present\ntriumphs and quickly forgetting past failures. This makes us less tolerant to\nthat which challenges present orthodoxy. It may be of value to recall such past\ndeficiences as well as present shortcomings, particularly since science may\nalways be encumbered with such limitations. We can avoid serious pitfalls if we\nlet the past serve as a guide to the future. Subjects covered will include\nGodel's theorem, superconductivity, zero-point energy, the quantum and\nclassical Aharonov-Bohm and similar effects, theories of general relativity,\nMach's principle, black hole radiation, ball lightning, and the universe(s).\n"]}
