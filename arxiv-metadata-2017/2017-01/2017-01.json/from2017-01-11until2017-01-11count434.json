that a realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics is possible\nand useful. Current interpretations, from Copenhagen to many worlds are\ncritically revisited. The difficulties for intuitive models of quantum physics\nare pointed out and possible solutions proposed. In particular the existence of\ndiscrete states, the quantum jumps, the alleged lack of objective properties,\nmeasurement theory, the probabilistic character of quantum physics, the\nwave-particle du- ality and the Bell inequalities are analyzed. The sketch of a\nrealistic picture of the quantum world is presented. It rests upon the assump-\ntion that quantum mechanics is a stochastic theory whose randomness derives\nfrom the existence of vacuum fields. They correspond to the vacuum fluctuations\nof quantum field theory, but taken as real rather than virtual.\n", "  In this paper, we study the formal solution space of a nonlinear PDE in a\nfiber bundle. To this end, we start with foundational material and introduce\nthe notion of a pfd structure to build up a new concept of profinite\ndimensional manifolds. We show that the infinite jet space of the fiber bundle\nis a profinite dimensional manifold in a natural way. The formal solution space\nof the nonlinear PDE then is a subspace of this jet space, and inherits from it\nthe structure of a profinite dimensional manifold, if the PDE is formally\nintegrable. We apply our concept to scalar PDEs and prove a new criterion for\nformal integrability of such PDEs. In particular, this result entails that the\nEuler-Lagrange equation of a relativistic scalar field with a polynomial\nself-interaction is formally integrable.\n", "  A study of proper affine vector fields in non static axially symmetric\nspace-times is given by using holonomy and decomposability, the rank of the 6X6\nRiemann matrix and direct integration techniques. It is shown that the special\nclass of the above space-times admits proper affine vector fields.\n", "  In this paper, we study the minimal output entropy of EPOSIC channels. We\ndetermine the cases where their minimal output entropy is zero, and obtain some\npartial results on the fulfillment of their entanglement breaking property.Our\nresults show that these channels provide potential examples for non-additivity\nof the minimal output entropy.\n", "  Testing the properties of the Higgs particle discovered at the LHC and\nsearching for new physics signals, are some of the most important tasks of\nParticle Physics today. Current measurements of the Higgs couplings to fermions\nand gauge bosons, seem consistent with the Standard Model, and when taken as a\nfunction of the particle mass, should lay on a single line. However, in models\nwith an extended Higgs sector the diagonal Higgs couplings to up-quarks,\ndown-quarks and charged leptons, could lay on different lines, while\nnon-diagonal flavor-violating Higgs couplings could appear too. We describe\nthese possibilities within the context of multi-Higgs doublet models that\nemploy the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism to generate the Yukawa hierarchies.\nFurthermore, one of the doublets can be chosen to be of the inert type, which\nprovides a viable dark matter candidate. The mixing of the Higgs doublets with\nthe flavon field, can provide plenty of interesting signals, including: i)\nsmall corrections to the couplings of the SM-like Higgs, ii) exotic signals\nfrom the flavon fields, iii) new signatures from the heavy Higgs bosons. These\naspects are studied within a specific model with 3+1 Higgs doublets and a\nsinglet FN field. Constraints on the model are derived from the study of K and\nD mixing and the Higgs search at the LHC. For last, the implications from the\nlatter aforementioned constraints to the FCNC top decay $t\\to ch$ are presented\ntoo.\n", "  The study of the quantization of the QCD string with the helix structure is\nput into the context of a decades-long discussion opposing the probabilistic\nand the deterministic interpretations of the quantum theory. The recent\nevolution of the string fragmentation model (to a large extent driven and\nconfirmed by the empirical evidence), towards the deterministic point of view\nis recounted: the notion of causality not only paves a way to the study of mass\nspectrum, it also resolves a long-standing ambiguity about the nature of the\nso-called Bose-Einstein correlations. Two directions for the further\ndevelopment of the model are outlined: 1/ the elimination of soft collinear\ndivergencies, 2/ the relation between the topological properties of the QCD\nstring and the emergence of new particle types (quantum numbers).\n", "  We propose a magnetization reversal model to explain the perpendicular\nswitching of a single ferromagnetic layer induced by an in-plane current.\nContrary to previously proposed reversal mechanisms that such magnetic\nswitching is directly from the Rashba or spin Hall effects, we suggest that\nthis type of switching arises from the current-induced chirality dependent\ndomain wall motion. By measuring the field dependent switching behaviors, we\nshow that such switching can also be achieved between any two multidomain\nstates, and all of these switching behaviors can be well explained by this\nmodel. This model indicates that the spin Hall angle in such structures may be\noverestimated and also predicts similar switching behaviors in other\nferromagnetic structures with chiral domain walls or skyrmions.\n", "  We construct Hadamard states for Klein-Gordon fields in a spacetime $M_{0}$\nequal to the interior of the future lightcone $C$ from a base point $p$ in a\nglobally hyperbolic spacetime $(M, g)$. Under some regularity conditions at\nfuture infinity of $C$, we identify a boundary symplectic space of functions on\n$C$, which allows to construct states for Klein-Gordon quantum fields in\n$M_{0}$ from states on the CCR algebra associated to the boundary symplectic\nspace. We formulate the natural microlocal condition on the boundary state on\n$C$ ensuring that the bulk state it induces in $M_{0}$ satisfies the Hadamard\ncondition. Using pseudodifferential calculus on the cone $C$ we construct a\nlarge class of Hadamard boundary states on the boundary with pseudodifferential\ncovariances, and characterize the pure states among them. We then show that\nthese pure boundary states induce pure Hadamard states in $M_{0}$.\n", "  (arXiv abridged abstract) The observed UV rest-frame spectra of distant\ngalaxies are the result of their intrinsic emission combined with absorption\nalong the line of sight produced by the inter-galactic medium (IGM). Here we\nanalyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Ly_alpha) and its\ndispersion along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5<z<5.5 in the\nVIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We fit model spectra combined with a range of\nIGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral fitting algorithm\nGOSSIP+. We use these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each\ngalaxy for several redshift slices from z=2.5 to z=5.5. We find that the mean\nIGM transmission defined as Tr(Ly_alpha)=e^{-tau} (with tau the HI optical\ndepth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55% and 46% at redshifts 2.75, 3,22, 3.70, 4.23, 4.77,\nrespectively. We compare these results to measurements obtained from quasars\nlines of sight and find that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in\nexcellent agreement with quasar values up to redshift z~4. We find tentative\nevidence for a higher IGM transmission at z>= 4 compared to results from QSOs,\nbut a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents to draw firm\nconclusions if the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z>4\ntakes a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V)>0.15. Most importantly, we\nfind a large dispersion of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards\ndistant galaxies with 68% of the distribution within 10 to 17% of the median\nvalue in delta z=0.5 bins, similar to what is found on the LOS towards QSOs. We\ndemonstrate the importance of taking into account this large range of IGM\ntransmission when selecting high redshift galaxies based on their colour\nproperties (e.g. LBG or photometric redshift selection) or otherwise face a\nsignificant incompleteness in selecting high redshift galaxy populations.\n", "  Moulinec and Suquet introduced FFT-based homogenization in 1994, and twenty\nyears later, their approach is still effective for evaluating the homogenized\nproperties arising from the periodic cell problem. This paper builds on the\nauthor's (2013) variational reformulation approximated by trigonometric\npolynomials establishing two numerical schemes: Galerkin approximation (Ga) and\na version with numerical integration (GaNi). The latter approach, fully\nequivalent to the original Moulinec-Suquet algorithm, was used to evaluate\nguaranteed upper-lower bounds on homogenized coefficients incorporating a\nclosed-form double grid quadrature. Here, these concepts, based on the primal\nand the dual formulations, are employed for the Ga scheme. For the same\ncomputational effort, the Ga outperforms the GaNi with more accurate guaranteed\nbounds and more predictable numerical behaviors. Quadrature technique leading\nto block-sparse linear systems is extended here to materials defined via\nhigh-resolution images in a way which allows for effective treatment using the\nFFT. Memory demands are reduced by a reformulation of the double to the\noriginal grid scheme using FFT shifts. Minimization of the bounds during\niterations of conjugate gradients is effective, particularly when incorporating\na solution from a coarser grid. The methodology presented here for the scalar\nlinear elliptic problem could be extended to more complex frameworks.\n", "  Minimal models of self-propelled particles with short-range volume exclusion\ninteractions have been shown to exhibit signatures of phase separation. Here I\nshow that the observed interfacial stability and fluctuations in\nmotility-induced phase separations (MIPS) can be explained by modeling the\nmicroscopic dynamics of the active particles in the interfacial region. In\naddition, I demonstrate the validity of the Gibbs-Thomson relation in MIPS,\nwhich provides a functional relationship between the size of a condensed drop\nand its surrounding vapor concentration. As a result, the coarsening dynamics\nof MIPS at vanishing supersaturation follows the classic Lifshitz-Slyozov\nscaling law at the late stage.\n", "  The reanalysis datasets provide very important sources for investigating the\nclimate dynamics and climate changes in Antarctica. In this paper, three major\nreanalysis data are compared with Antarctic station data over the last 35\nyears: the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National\nCenter for Atmospheric Research reanalysis (NCEP1), NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2\n(NCEP2), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim\nRe-Analysis (ERA-Interim). In our assessment, we compare the linear trends, the\nfluctuations around the trends, the persistence properties and the significance\nlevel of warming trends in the reanalysis data with the observational ones. We\nfind that NCEP1 and NCEP2 show spurious warming trends in all parts of\nAntarctica except the Peninsula, while ERA-Interim is quite reliable except at\nAmundsen-Scott. To investigate the persistence of the data sets, we consider\nthe lag-1 autocorrelation $C(1)$ and the Hurst exponent. While $C(1)$ varies\nquite erratically in different stations, the Hurst exponent shows similar\npatterns all over Antarctica. Regarding the significance of the trends, NCEP1\nand NCEP2 differ considerably from the observational datasets by strongly\nexaggerating the warming trends. In contrast, ERA-Interim gives reliable\nresults at most stations except at Amundsen-Scott where it shows a significant\ncooling trend.\n", "  In undergraduate research experiences, student development of an identity as\na scientist is coupled to their sense of ownership of their research projects.\nAs a a first step towards studying similar connections in physics laboratory\ncourses, we investigate student ownership of projects in a lasers-based\nupper-division course. Students spent the final seven weeks of the semester\nworking in groups on final projects of their choosing. Using data from the\nProject Ownership Survey and weekly student reflections, we investigate student\nownership as it relates to students' personal agency, self-efficacy, peer\ninteractions, and complex affective responses to challenges and successes. We\npresent evidence of students' project ownership in an upper-division physics\nlab. Additionally, we find that there is a complex relationship between student\naffect and their sense of ownership.\n", "  We propose and develop a Lexicocalorimeter: an online, interactive instrument\nfor measuring the \"caloric content\" of social media and other large-scale\ntexts. We do so by constructing extensive yet improvable tables of food and\nactivity related phrases, and respectively assigning them with sourced\nestimates of caloric intake and expenditure. We show that for Twitter, our\nnaive measures of \"caloric input\", \"caloric output\", and the ratio of these\nmeasures are all strong correlates with health and well-being measures for the\ncontiguous United States. Our caloric balance measure in many cases outperforms\nboth its constituent quantities, is tunable to specific health and well-being\nmeasures such as diabetes rates, has the capability of providing a real-time\nsignal reflecting a population's health, and has the potential to be used\nalongside traditional survey data in the development of public policy and\ncollective self-awareness. Because our Lexicocalorimeter is a linear\nsuperposition of principled phrase scores, we also show we can move beyond\ncorrelations to explore what people talk about in collective detail, and assist\nin the understanding and explanation of how population-scale conditions vary, a\ncapacity unavailable to black-box type methods.\n", "  We study boundary scattering in the $\\phi^4$ model on a half-line with a\none-parameter family of Neumann-type boundary conditions. A rich variety of\nphenomena is observed, which extends previously-studied behaviour on the full\nline to include regimes of near-elastic scattering, the restoration of a\nmissing scattering window, and the creation of a kink or oscillon through the\ncollision-induced decay of a metastable boundary state. We also study the decay\nof the vibrational boundary mode, and explore different scenarios for its\nrelaxation and for the creation of kinks.\n", "  Coupled DGLAP equations involving singlet quark and gluon distributions are\nexplored by a Taylor expansion as two first order partial differential\nequations in two variables. The system of equations are then solved by the\nLagrange's method and Method of Characteristics. We obtain the proton structure\nfunction by combining the corresponding non-singlet and singlet structure\nfunctions by both the methods. Analytical solutions for proton structure\nfunction thus obtained are compared with the data available and their\ncompatibility is checked. Data favors the analytical solution by Lagrange's\nmethod.\n", "  A key property of many-body localization, the localization of quantum\nparticles in systems with both quenched disorder and interactions, is the area\nlaw entanglement of even highly excited eigenstates of many-body localized\nHamiltonians. Matrix Product States (MPS) can be used to efficiently represent\nlow entanglement (area law) wave functions in one dimension. An important\napplication of MPS is the widely used Density Matrix Renormalization Group\n(DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states of one dimensional Hamiltonians.\nHere, we describe two algorithms, the Shift and Invert MPS (SIMPS) and excited\nstate DMRG which finds highly-excited eigenstates of many-body localized\nHamiltonians. Excited state DMRG uses a modified sweeping procedure to identify\neigenstates whereas SIMPS is a shift-inverse procedure that applies the inverse\nof the shifted Hamiltonian to a MPS multiple times to project out the targeted\neigenstate. To demonstrate the power of these methods we verify the breakdown\nof the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) in the many-body localized\nphase of the random field Heisenberg model, show the saturation of entanglement\nin the MBL phase and generate local excitations.\n", "  What main mechanisms set the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies? This PhD\nthesis is a quest into the influences of gas and active galactic nuclei (AGNs)\non the SFR, with particular focus on massive galaxies at z~2. First, a new code\nif presented; SImulator of GAlaxy Millimeter/submillimeter Emission (S\\'IGAME)\nwhich can predict the atomic/molecular line emission in the far-infrared regime\nfrom galaxies. By post-processing the outputs of cosmological simulations of\ngalaxy formation with sub-grid physics recipes, S\\'IGAME divides the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) into different gas phases and derives density and\ntemperature structure, employing locally resolved radiation and pressure\nfields. This method is used to predict the strengths of CO rotational\ntransitions as well as the [CII] emission line in normal star-forming galaxies\nat z~2. A CO ladder close to that of our own Galaxy is found, but with CO-H2\nconversion factors about 3 times smaller. For a set of 7 simulated galaxies at\nz~2, the relation between [CII] luminosity and SFR displays a slope\nsignificantly steeper than that found for observed galaxies at z<0.5. A\ncorresponding relation on kpc-scales is established for the first time\ntheoretically. Finally, a separate study uncovers the number fraction of AGNs\namong massive galaxies at z~2, by analyzing CHANDRA CDF-S X-ray data. It is\nfound that about every fifth massive galaxy, quenched or not, contains an X-ray\nluminous AGN. Interestingly, an even higher fraction of low-luminosity AGNs\nemerges in the X-ray undetected galaxies when performing a stacking analysis,\nand preferentially in the quenched ones, lending support to the importance of\nAGNs in impeding star formation during galaxy evolution.\n", "  We present the full Gutzwiller-wave-function solution of the Anderson lattice\nmodel in two dimensions that leads to the correlation-driven multigap\nsuperconducting (SC) ground state with the dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave\nsymmetry. The results are consistent with the principal properties of the\nheavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We regard the pairing mechanism as\nuniversal and thus applicable to other Ce-based heavy-fermion compounds.\nAdditionally, a gain in kinetic energy in the SC state takes place, as is also\nthe case for high-temperature superconductors.\n", "  We examine generation dynamics of coherent phonons (CPs) in both of polar and\nnon-polar semiconductors -- such as GaAs and Si -- based on a\npolaronic-quasiparticle (PQ) model. In the model concerned, the PQ operator is\ncomposed of two kinds of operators. One is a quasiboson operator -- defined as\na linear combination of a set of pairs of electron operators -- and the other\nis a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon operator. The problem of transient and\nnon-linear Fano resonance (FR) is tackled in particular; the vestige of this\nquantum interference effect was observed exclusively in lightly $n$-doped Si\nimmediately after carriers were excited by an ultrashort pulse-laser [M. Hase\net. al., Nature 426, 51 (2003)], though not observed yet in GaAs. It is shown\nthat the phonon energy state is embedded in a continuum state formed by a set\nof adiabatic eigenstates of the quasiboson. This result implies the possibility\nof manifestation of the transient FR in the present optically-non-linear\nsystem.\n", "  In cuprates, a precursor state of superconductivity is speculated to exist\nabove the critical temperature $\\mathrm{T_C}$. Here we show via a combination\nof far-infrared ellipsometry and ultrafast broadband optical spectroscopy that\nsignatures of such a state can be obtained via three independent observables in\nan underdoped sample of NdBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\\delta}$. The pseudogap\ncorrelations were disentangled from the response of laser-broken pairs by\nclocking their characteristic time-scales. The onset of a superconducting\nprecursor state was found at a temperature $\\mathrm{T_{ONS}}$ $>$\n$\\mathrm{T_C}$, consistent with the temperature scale identified via static\noptical spectroscopy. Furthermore, the temperature evolution of the coherent\nvibration of the Ba ion, strongly renormalized by the onset of\nsuperconductivity, revealed a pronounced anomaly at the same temperature\n$\\mathrm{T_{ONS}}$. The microscopic nature of such a precursor state is\ndiscussed in terms of pre-formed pairs and enhanced bilayer coherence.\n", "  Slow magnetoacoustic waves were first detected in hot ($>$6 MK) flare loops\nby the SOHO/SUMER spectrometer as Doppler shift oscillations in Fe XIX and Fe\nXXI lines. Recently, such longitudinal waves have been found by SDO/AIA in the\n94 and 131 \\AA\\ channels. Wang et al. (2015) reported the first AIA event\nrevealing signatures in agreement with a fundamental standing slow-mode wave,\nand found quantitative evidence for thermal conduction suppression from the\ntemperature and density perturbations in the hot loop plasma of $\\gtrsim$ 9 MK.\nThe present study extends the work of Wang et al. (2015) by using an\nalternative approach. We determine the polytropic index directly based on the\npolytropic assumption instead of invoking the linear approximation. The same\nresults are obtained as in the linear approximation, indicating that the\nnonlinearity effect is negligible. We find that the flare loop cools slower (by\na factor of 2-4) than expected from the classical Spitzer conductive cooling,\napproximately consistent with the result of conduction suppression obtained\nfrom the wave analysis. The modified Spitzer cooling timescales based on the\nnonlocal conduction approximation are consistent with the observed, suggesting\nthat nonlocal conduction may account for the observed conduction suppression in\nthis event. In addition, the conduction suppression mechanism predicts that\nlarger flares may tend to be hotter than expected by the EM-$T$ relation\nderived by Shibata & Yokoyama (2002)\n", "  The cosmic star formation rate density first increases with time towards a\npronounced peak 10 Gyrs ago (or z=1-2) and then slows down, dropping by more\nthan a factor 10 since z=1. The processes at the origin of the star formation\nquenching are not yet well identified, either the gas is expelled by supernovae\nand AGN feedback, or prevented to inflow. Morphological transformation or\nenvironment effects are also invoked. Recent IRAM/NOEMA and ALMA results are\nreviewed about the molecular content of galaxies and its dynamics, as a\nfunction of redshift. Along the main sequence of massive star forming galaxies,\nthe gas fraction was higher in the past (up to 80\\%), and galaxy disks were\nmore unstable and more turbulent.\n  The star formation efficiency increases with redshift, or equivalently the\ndepletion time decreases, whatever the position of galaxies, either on the main\nsequence or above. Attempts have been made to determine the cosmic evolution of\nthe H_2 density, but deeper ALMA observations are needed to effectively compare\nwith models.\n", "  We apply the Jeans Axisymmetric Multi-Gaussian Expansion method to the\nstellar kinematic maps of 40 Sa-Sd EDGE-CALIFA galaxies and derive their\ncircular velocity curves (CVCs). The CVCs are classified using the Dynamical\nClassification method developed in Kalinova et al. (2015) . We also calculate\nthe observational baryon efficiency, OBE, where\n$M_*/M_b=M_*/(M_*+M_{HI}+M_{H_2})$ of the galaxies using their stellar mass,\ntotal neutral hydrogen mass and total molecular gas from CO luminosities.\nSlow-rising, Flat and Round-peaked CVC types correspond to specific OBEs,\nstellar and dark matter (DM) halo mass values, while the Sharp-peaked CVCs span\nin the whole DM halo mass range of $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  I review some steps in the conversion of molecular cloud gas into stars and\nplanets, with an emphasis in this presentation on the early stage molecular\ncloud fragmentation that leads to elongated filaments/ribbons. Magnetic fields\ncan play a crucial role in all stages and need to be invoked particularly for\nearly stage fragmentation as well as in late core collapse where it may control\ndisk formation. I also review some elements of hydrodynamic modeling of disk\nevolution.\n", "  Ultra-precise light curves from Kepler provide the best opportunity to\ndetermine rates and statistical properties of stellar flares. From 11 months of\ndata on the active M4 dwarf, GJ 1243, we have built the largest catalog of\nflares for a single star: over 6100 events. Combining 885 of our most pristine\nflares, we generated an empirical white-light flare template. This\nhigh-fidelity template shows a rapid initial rise, and two distinct exponential\ncooling phases. This template is useful in constraining flare energies and for\nimproved flare detection in many surveys. Complex, multi-peaked events are more\ncommon for higher energy flares in this sample. Using our flare template we\ncharacterize the structure of complex events. In this contributed talk, I\npresented results from our boutique study of GJ 1243, and described an expanded\ninvestigation of the structure of complex flares and their connection to solar\nevents.\n", "  The statistical description of Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) properties relies\nheavily on the performance of automatic identification algorithms, which are\noften seriously affected by the survey design. The algorithm we designed,\nSCIMES (Spectral Clustering for Interstellar Molecular Emission Segmentation),\nis able to overcome some of these limitations by considering the cloud\nsegmentation problem in the broad framework of the graph theory. The\napplication of the code on the CO(3-2) High Resolution Survey (COHRS) data\nallowed for a robust decomposition of more than 12,000 objects in the Galactic\nPlane. Together with the wealth of Galactic Plane surveys of the recent years,\nthis approach will help to open the door to a future, systematic cataloging of\nall discrete molecular features of our own Galaxy.\n", "  The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is a fundamental astrophysical\nquantity that impacts a wide range of astrophysical problems from heavy element\ndistribution to galactic evolution to planetary system formation. However, the\norigin and universality of the IMF are hotly debated both observationally and\ntheoretically. I review recent observations of the IMF across a variety of\nenvironments. These suggest the IMF is surprisingly invariant between\nstar-forming regions, star clusters, and spiral galaxies but that it may also\nvary under extreme conditions, including within the Galactic center and early\ntype galaxies.\n", "  We have mapped cold atomic gas in 21cm line HI self-absorption (HISA) at\narcminute resolution over more than 90% of the Milky Way's disk. To probe the\nformation of H2 clouds, we have compared our HISA distribution with CO J=1-0\nline emission. Few HISA features in the outer Galaxy have CO at the same\nposition and velocity, while most inner-Galaxy HISA has overlapping CO. But\nmany apparent inner-Galaxy HISA-CO associations can be explained as chance\nsuperpositions, so most inner-Galaxy HISA may also be CO-free. Since standard\nequilibrium cloud models cannot explain the very cold HI in many HISA features\nwithout molecules being present, these clouds may instead have significant\nCO-dark H2.\n", "  I review theoretical models of star formation and how they apply across the\nstellar mass spectrum. Several distinct theories are under active study for\nmassive star formation, especially Turbulent Core Accretion, Competitive\nAccretion and Protostellar Mergers, leading to distinct observational\npredictions. These include the types of initial conditions, the structure of\ninfall envelopes, disks and outflows, and the relation of massive star\nformation to star cluster formation. Even for Core Accretion models, there are\nseveral major uncertainties related to the timescale of collapse, the relative\nimportance of different processes for preventing fragmentation in massive\ncores, and the nature of disks and outflows. I end by discussing some recent\nobservational results that are helping to improve our understanding of these\nprocesses.\n", "  The Herschel Space Observatory was the fourth cornerstone mission in the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA) science programme with excellent broad band imaging\ncapabilities in the sub-mm and far-infrared part of the spectrum. Although the\nspacecraft finished its observations in 2013, it left a large legacy dataset\nthat is far from having been fully scrutinised and still has a large potential\nfor new scientific discoveries. This is specifically true for the photometric\nobservations of the PACS and SPIRE instruments. Some source catalogues have\nalready been produced by individual observing programs, but there are many\nobservations that risk to remain unexplored. To maximise the science return of\nthe SPIRE and PACS data sets, we are in the process of building the Herschel\nPoint Source Catalogue (HPSC) from all primary and parallel mode observations.\nOur homogeneous source extraction enables a systematic and unbiased comparison\nof sensitivity across the different Herschel fields that single programs will\ngenerally not be able to provide. The catalogue will be made available online\nthrough archives like the Herschel Science Archive (HSA), the Infrared Science\nArchive (IRSA), and the Strasbourg Astronomical Data Center (CDS).\n", "  We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to investigate\nthe quasi-equilibrium states of galactic disks regulated by star formation\nfeedback. We incorporate effects from massive-star feedback via time-varying\nheating rates and supernova (SN) explosions. We find that the disks in our\nsimulations rapidly approach a quasi-steady state that satisfies vertical\ndynamical equilibrium. The star formation rate (SFR) surface density\nself-adjusts to provide the total momentum flux (pressure) in the vertical\ndirection that matches the weight of the gas. We quantify feedback efficiency\nby measuring feedback yields, \\eta_c\\equiv P_c/\\Sigma_SFR (in suitable units),\nfor each pressure component. The turbulent and thermal feedback yields are the\nsame for HD and MHD simulations, \\eta_th~1 and \\eta_ turb~4, consistent with\nthe theoretical expectations. In MHD simulations, turbulent magnetic fields are\nrapidly generated by turbulence, and saturate at a level corresponding to\n\\eta_mag,t~1. The presence of magnetic fields enhances the total feedback yield\nand therefore reduces the SFR, since the same vertical support can be supplied\nat a smaller SFR. We suggest further numerical calibrations and observational\ntests in terms of the feedback yields.\n", "  In this talk, we discuss the formation of the near-ultraviolet and optical\ncontinuum emission in M dwarf flares through the formation of a dense, heated\nchromospheric condensation. Results are used from a recent\nradiative-hydrodynamic model of the response of an M dwarf atmosphere to a high\nenergy flux of nonthermal electrons. These models are used to infer the charge\ndensity and optical depth in continuum emitting flare layers from spectra\ncovering the Balmer jump and optical wavelength regimes. Future modeling and\nobservational directions are discussed.\n", "  Active gas accretion onto the Milky Way is observed in an object called the\nSmith Cloud, which contains several million solar masses of neutral and warm\nionized gas and is currently losing material to the Milky Way, adding angular\nmomentum to the disk. It is several kpc in size and its tip lies two kpc below\nthe Galactic plane. It appears to have no stellar counterpart, but could\ncontain a stellar population like that of the dwarf galaxy Leo P. There are\nsuggestions that its existence and survival require that it be embedded in a\ndark matter halo of a few 10^8 solar masses.\n", "  Star formation in strongly self-gravitating cloud cores should be similar at\nall redshifts, forming single or multiple stars with a range of masses\ndetermined by local magneto-hydrodynamics and gravity. The formation processes\nfor these cores, however, as well as their structures, temperatures, Mach\nnumbers, etc., and the boundedness and mass distribution functions of the\nresulting stars, should depend on environment, as should the characteristic\nmass, density, and column density at which cloud self-gravity dominates other\nforces. Because the environments for high and low redshift star formation\ndiffer significantly, we expect the resulting gas to stellar conversion details\nto differ also. At high redshift, the universe is denser and more gas-rich, so\nthe active parts of galaxies are denser and more gas rich too, leading to\nslightly shorter gas consumption timescales, higher cloud pressures, and\ndenser, more massive, bound stellar clusters at the high mass end. With shorter\nconsumption times corresponding to higher relative cosmic accretion rates, and\nwith the resulting higher star formation rates and their higher feedback\npowers, the ISM has greater turbulent speeds relative to the rotation speeds,\nthicker gas disks, and larger cloud and star complex sizes at the\ncharacteristic Jeans length. The result is a more chaotic appearance at high\nredshift, bridging the morphology gap between today's quiescent spirals and\ntoday's major-mergers, with neither spiral nor major-merger processes actually\nin play at that time. The result is also a thick disk at early times, and after\nin-plane accretion from relatively large clump torques, a classical bulge.\nToday's disks are thinner, and torque-driven accretion is slower outside of\ninner barred regions. This paper reviews the basic processes involved with star\nformation in order to illustrate its evolution over time and environment.\n", "  Here, we present a set of time-dependent 3D RMHD simulations of a M-dwarf\nstar representative of AD Leo, which extend from the upper convection zone into\nthe chromosphere. The 3D model atmospheres are characterized by a very dynamic\nand intermittent structure on small spatial and temporal scales and a wealth of\nphysical processes, which by nature cannot be described by means of 1D static\nmodel atmospheres. Artificial observations of these models imply that a\ncombination of complementary diagnostics such as Ca II lines and the continuum\nintensity from UV to millimeter wavelengths, probe various properties of the\ndynamics, thermal and magnetic structure of the photosphere and the\nchromosphere and thus provide measures of stellar activity, which can be\ncompared to observations. The complicated magnetic field structure and its\nimprint in synthetic diagnostics may have important implications for the\nunderstanding and characterization of stellar activity and with it possibly for\nthe evaluation of planetary habitability around active M-dwarf stars.\n", "  As the LHC moves to higher energies and luminosity, the demand for computing\nresources increases accordingly and will soon outpace the growth of the\nWorldwide LHC Computing Grid. To meet this greater demand, event generation\nMonte Carlo was targeted for adaptation to run on Mira, the supercomputer at\nthe Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Alpgen is a Monte Carlo event\ngeneration application that is used by LHC experiments in the simulation of\ncollisions that take place in the Large Hadron Collider. This paper details the\nprocess by which Alpgen was adapted from a single-processor serial-application\nto a large-scale parallel-application and the performance that was achieved.\n", "  One potential star-planet interaction mechanism for hot Jupiters involves\nplanetary heating via currents set up by interactions between the stellar wind\nand planetary magnetosphere. Early modeling results indicate that such\ncurrents, which are analogous to the terrestrial global electric circuit (GEC),\nhave the potential to provide sufficient heating to account for the additional\nradius inflation seen in some hot Jupiters. Here we present a more detailed\nmodel of this phenomenon, exploring the scale of the effect, the circumstances\nunder which it is likely to be significant, implications for the planetary\nmagnetospheric structure, and observational signatures.\n", "  Ensembles of electron spins in hybrid microwave systems are powerful and\nversatile components for future quantum technologies. Quantum memories with\nhigh storage capacities are one such example which require long-lived states\nthat can be addressed and manipulated coherently within the inhomogeneously\nbroadened ensemble. This broadening is essential for true multimode memories,\nbut induces a considerable spin dephasing and together with dissipation from a\ncavity interface poses a constraint on the memory's storage time. In this work\nwe show how to overcome both of these limitations through the engineering of\nlong-lived dark states in an ensemble of electron spins hosted by\nnitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond. By burning narrow spectral holes into a\nspin ensemble strongly coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity, we\nobserve long-lived Rabi oscillations with high visibility and a decay rate that\nis a factor of forty smaller than the spin ensemble linewidth and thereby a\nfactor of more than three below the pure cavity dissipation rate. This\nsignificant reduction lives up to the promise of hybrid devices to perform\nbetter than their individual subcomponents. To demonstrate the potential of our\napproach we realise the first step towards a solid-state microwave spin\nmultiplexer by engineering multiple long-lived dark states. Our results show\nthat we can fully access the \"decoherence free\" subspace in our experiment and\nselectively prepare protected states by spectral hole burning. This technique\nopens up the way for truly long-lived quantum memories, solid-state microwave\nfrequency combs, optical to microwave quantum transducers and spin squeezed\nstates. Our approach also paves the way for a new class of cavity QED\nexperiments with dense spin ensembles, where dipole spin-spin interactions\nbecome important and many-body phenomena will be directly accessible on a chip.\n", "  We present a model for the seeding and evolution of magnetic fields in\ngalaxies by supernovae (SN). SN explosions during galaxy assembly provide seed\nfields, which are subsequently amplified by compression, shear flows and random\nmotions. Our model explains the origin of microG magnetic fields within\ngalactic structures. We implement our model in the MHD version of the\ncosmological simulation code Gadget-3 and couple it with a multi-phase\ndescription of the interstellar medium. We perform simulations of Milky\nWay-like galactic halo formation and analyze the distribution and strength of\nthe magnetic field. We investigate the intrinsic rotation measure (RM)\nevolution and find RM values exceeding 1000 rad/m*m at high redshifts and RM\nvalues around 10 rad/m*m at present-day. We compare our simulations to a\nlimited set of observational data points and find encouraging similarities. In\nour model, galactic magnetic fields are a natural consequence of the very basic\nprocesses of star formation and galaxy assembly.\n", "  Started its regular, daily operational phase in 2011 and installed in 2009 by\nthe occasion of the Symp264 in the XXVII IAU GA at Rio de Janeiro, the results\nso far obtained show that the Heliometer of the Observatorio Nacional fulfilled\nits planed performance of single measurement to the level of few tens of\nmilli-arcsecond, freely pivoting around the heliolatitudes without systematic\ndeviations or error enhancement. We present and discuss the astrometric\nadditions required on ground based astronomic programs. We also discuss\ninstrumental and observations terms, namely the constancy of the basic\nheliometric angle, against which the measurements are made, and the\nindependence to meteorological and pointing conditions.\n", "  The effect of a generalized uncertainty principle on the structure of an\nideal white dwarf star is investigated. The equation describing the equilibrium\nconfiguration of the star is a generalized form of the Lane-Emden equation. It\nis proved that the star always has a finite size. It is then argued that the\nmaximum mass of such an ideal white dwarf tends to infinity, as opposed to the\nconventional case where it has a finite value.\n", "  Solution processed field-effect transistors based on single crystalline\nsilicon nanowires (Si NWs) with metal Schottky contacts are demonstrated. The\nsemiconducting layer was deposited from a nanowire ink formulation at room\ntemperature. The devices with 230nm thick SiO2 gate insulating layers show\nexcellent output current-voltage characteristics with early saturation voltages\nunder 2 volts, constant saturation current and exceptionally low dependence of\nsaturation voltage with the gate field. Operational principles of these devices\nare markedly different from traditional ohmic-contact field-effect transistors\n(FETs), and are explained using the source-gated transistor (SGT) concept in\nwhich the semiconductor under the reverse biased Schottky source barrier is\ndepleted leading to low voltage pinch-off and saturation of drain current.\nDevice parameters including activation energy are extracted at different\ntemperatures and gate voltages to estimate the Schottky barrier height for\ndifferent electrode materials to establish transistor performance - barrier\nheight relationships. Numerical simulations are performed using 2D thin-film\napproximation of the device structures at various Schottky barrier heights.\nWithout any adjustable parameters and only assuming low p-doping of the\ntransistor channel, the modelled data show exceptionally good correlation with\nthe measured data. From both experimental and simulation results, it is\nconcluded that source-barrier controlled nanowire transistors have excellent\npotential advantages compared with a standard FET including mitigation of\nshort-channel effects, insensitivity in device operating currents to device\nchannel length variation, higher on/off ratios, higher gain, lower power\nconsumption and higher operational speed for solution processable and printable\nnanowire electronics.\n", "  This review covers four current questions in the behavior of the atomic and\nmolecular interstellar medium. These include whether the atomic gas originates\nprimarily in cold streams or hot flows onto galaxies; what the filling factor\nof cold gas actually is in galactic regions observationally determined to be\ncompletely molecular; whether molecular hydrogen determines or merely traces\nstar formation; and whether gravity or turbulence drives the dynamical motions\nobserved in interstellar clouds, with implications on their star formation\nproperties.\n", "  In the central regions of active galaxies, dense molecular medium are exposed\nto various types of radiation and energy injections, such as UV, X-ray, cosmic\nray, and shock dissipation. With the rapid progress of chemical models and\nimplementation of new-generation mm/submm interferometry, we are now able to\nuse molecules as powerful diagnostics of the physical and chemical processes in\ngalaxies. Here we give a brief overview on the recent ALMA results to\ndemonstrate how molecules can reveal underlying physical and chemical processes\nin galaxies. First, new detections of Galactic molecular absorption systems\nwith elevated HCO/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ column density ratios are reported, indicating\nthat these molecular media are irradiated by intense UV fields. Second, we\ndiscuss the spatial distributions of various types of shock tracers including\nHNCO, CH$_3$OH and SiO in NGC 253 and NGC 1068. Lastly, we provide an overview\nof proposed diagnostic methods of nuclear energy sources using ALMA, with an\nemphasis on the synergy with sensitive mid-infrared spectroscopy, which will be\nimplemented by JWST and SPICA to disentangle the complex nature of heavily\nobscured galaxies across the cosmic time.\n", "  We searched for superflares on solar-type stars using the Kepler\nshort-cadence (1-min sampling) data in order to detect superflares with short\nduration. We found 187 superflares on 23 solar-type stars whose bolometric\nenergy ranges from the order of $10^{32}$ erg to $10^{36}$ erg. Using these new\ndata combined with the results from the data with 30-min sampling, we found the\noccurrence frequency ($dN/dE$) of superflares as a function of flare energy\n($E$) shows the power-law distribution ($dN/dE \\propto E ^{-\\alpha}$) with\n$\\alpha=1.5$ for $10^{33}<E<10^{36}$ erg. The upper limit of energy released by\nsuperflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy stored\nnear starspots which is estimated from the amplitude of brightness variations.\nWe also found that the duration of superflares ($\\tau$) increases with the\nflare energy ($E$) as $\\tau \\propto E^{0.39\\pm 0.03}$. This can be explained if\nwe assume the time-scale of flares is determined by the Alfv$\\acute{\\rm e}$n\ntime.\n", "  F-theory compactified on singular, elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau five-folds\ngives rise to two-dimensional gauge theories preserving N=(0,2) supersymmetry.\nIn this paper we initiate the study of such compactifications and determine the\ndictionary between the geometric data of the elliptic fibration and the 2d\ngauge theory such as the matter content in terms of (0,2) superfields and their\nsupersymmetric couplings. We study this setup both from a gauge-theoretic point\nof view, in terms of the partially twisted 7-brane theory, and provide a global\ngeometric description based on the structure of the elliptic fibration and its\nsingularities. Global consistency conditions are determined and checked against\nthe dual M-theory compactification to one dimension. This includes a discussion\nof gauge anomalies, the structure of the Green-Schwarz terms and the\nChern-Simons couplings in the dual M-theory supersymmetric quantum mechanics.\nFurthermore, by interpreting the resulting 2d (0,2) theories as heterotic\nworldsheet theories, we propose a correspondence between the geometric data of\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau five-folds and the target space of a heterotic\ngauged linear sigma-model (GLSM). In particular the correspondence between the\nLandau-Ginsburg and sigma-model phase of a 2d (0,2) GLSM is realized via\ndifferent T-branes or gluing data in F-theory.\n", "  The atomic-level structures of liquids and glasses are amorphous, lacking\nlong-range order. We characterize the atomic structures by integrating radial\ndistribution functions (RDF) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for\nseveral metallic liquids and glasses: Cu46Zr54, Ni80Al20, Ni33.3Zr66.7, and\nPd82Si18. Resulting cumulative coordination numbers (CN) show that metallic\nliquids have a dimension of d = 2.55 +/- 0.06 from the center atom to the first\ncoordination shell and metallic glasses have d = 2.71 +/- 0.04, both less than\n3. Between the first and second coordination shells, both phases crossover to a\ndimension of d = 3, as for a crystal. Observations from discrete atom\ncenter-of-mass position counting are corroborated by continuously counting Cu\nglass- and liquid-phase atoms on an artificial grid, which accounts for the\noccupied atomic volume. Results from Cu grid analysis show short-range d = 2.65\nfor Cu liquid and d = 2.76 for Cu glass. Cu grid structures crossover to d = 3\nat {\\xi}~8 {\\AA} (~3 atomic diameters). We study the evolution of local\nstructural dimensions during quenching and discuss its correlation with the\nglass transition phenomenon.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have been used to\ndemonstrate quantum effects such as Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluity,\nand quantized vortices. However, in these experiments, the polaritons have not\nreached thermal equilibrium when they undergo the transition to a coherent\nstate. This has prevented the verification of one of the canonical predictions\nfor condensation, namely the phase diagram. In this work, we have created a\npolariton gas in a semiconductor microcavity in which the quasiparticles have a\nlifetime much longer than their thermalization time. This allows them to reach\nthermal equilibrium in a laser-generated confining trap. Their energy\ndistributions are well fit by equilibrium Bose-Einstein distributions over a\nbroad range of densities and temperatures from very low densities all the way\nup to the threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation. The good fits of the\nBose-Einstein distribution over a broad range of density and temperature imply\nthat the particles obey the predicted power law for the phase boundary of\nBose-Einstein condensation.\n", "  Galaxy nuclei are a unique laboratory to study gas flows. High-resolution\nimaging of the gas flows in galactic nuclei are instrumental in the study of\nthe fueling and the feedback of star formation and nuclear activity in nearby\ngalaxies. Several fueling mechanisms can be now confronted in detail with\nobservations done with state-of-the-art interferometers. Furthermore, the study\nof gas flows in galactic nuclei can probe the feedback of activity on the\ninterstellar medium of galaxies. Feedback action from star formation and AGN\nactivity is invoked to prevent galaxies from becoming overly massive, but also\nto explain scaling laws like black hole (BH)-bulge mass correlations and the\nbimodal color distribution of galaxies. This close relationship between\ngalaxies and their central supermassive BH can be described as co-evolution.\nThere is mounting observational evidence for the existence of gas outflows in\ndifferent populations of starbursts and active galaxies, a manifestation of the\nfeedback of activity. We summarize the main results recently obtained from the\nobservation of galactic inflows and outflows in a variety of active galaxies\nwith current millimeter interferometers like ALMA or the IRAM array.\n", "  We have obtained a steady-state, 1-D model of the accretion disk of a\nprotostar taking into account the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We find\nthat the disk is divided into an outer turbulent region (OTR), a MRI suppressed\nregion (MSR), and an inner turbulent region (ITR). The outer turbulent region\nis fully turbulent because of MRI. However, in the range, r_{out} (= 8 - 60 AU)\nfrom the central star, MRI is suppressed around the midplane of the gas disk\nand a quiet area without turbulence appears, because the degree of ionization\nof gas becomes low enough. The disk becomes fully turbulent again in the range\nr in (= 0.2 - 1 AU), which is called the inner turbulent region, because the\nmidplane temperature become high enough (\\gt 1000 K) due to gravitational\nenergy release.\n  Planetesimals are formed through gravitational instability at the two\ndistinct sites, outer and inner MRI fronts (the boundaries between the MRI\nsuppressed region (MSR) and the outer and inner turbulent regions), because of\nthe radial concentration of the solid particles. At the outer MRI front, icy\nparticles grow through low-velocity collisions into porous aggregates with low\ndensities. They eventually undergo gravitational instability to form icy\nplanetesimals. On the other hand, rocky particles accumulate at the inner MRI\nfront, since their drift velocities turn outward due to the local maximum in\ngas pressure. They undergo gravitational instability in a sub-disk of pebbles\nto form rocky planetesimals at the inner MRI front.\n  The tandem regime is consistent with the ABEL model, in which the Earth was\ninitially formed as a completely volatile-free planet. The water and other\nvolatile elements came later through the accretion of icy particles by the\noccasional scatterings in the outer regions.\n", "  Flarix is a radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) code for modeling of the response\nof the chromosphere to a beam bombardment during solar flares. It solves the\nset of hydrodynamic conservation equations coupled with non-LTE equations of\nradiative transfer. The simulations are driven by high energy electron beams.\nWe present results of the Flarix simulations of a flaring loop relevant to the\nproblem of continuum radiation during flares. In particular we focus on\nproperties of the hydrogen Balmer continuum which was recently detected by\nIRIS.\n", "  We investigate the properties of 7Li with the JISP16 and chiral NNLO_opt\nnucleon-nucleon interactions and 7Be with the JISP16 interaction in the ab\ninitio no-core full configuration (NCFC) approach. We calculate selected\nobservables that include energy spectra, point proton root-mean-square radii,\nelectromagnetic moments and transitions. We compare our results with\nexperimental results, where available, as well as with results obtained using\nnucleon-nucleon plus three-nucleon interactions. We obtain reasonable agreement\nbetween theory and experiment for low-lying states that are dominated by\np-shell configurations.\n", "  We created the Herschel Footprint Database and web services for the Herschel\nSpace Observatory imaging data. For this database we set up a unified data\nmodel for the PACS and SPIRE Herschel instruments, from the pointing and header\ninformation of each observation, generated and stored sky coverages\n(footprints) of the observations in their exact geometric form. With this tool\nwe extend the capabilities of the Herschel Science Archive by providing an\neffective search tool that is able to find observations for selected sky\nlocations (objects), or even in larger areas in the sky.\n", "  Jinping Neutrino Experiment (Jinping) is proposed to significantly improve\nmeasurements on solar neutrinos and geoneutrinos in China Jinping Laboratory -\na lab with a number of unparalleled features, thickest overburden, lowest\nreactor neutrino background, etc., which identify it as the world-best\nlow-energy neutrino laboratory. The proposed experiment will have target mass\nof 4 kilotons of liquid scintillator or water-based liquid scintillator, with a\nfiducial mass of 2 kilotons for neutrino-electron scattering events and 3\nkilotons for inverse-beta interaction events. A number of initial sensitivities\nstudies have been carried out, including on the transition phase for the solar\nneutrinos oscillation from the vacuum to the matter effect, the discovery of\nsolar neutrinos from the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, the resolution of\nthe high and low metallicity hypotheses, and the unambiguous separation on U\nand Th cascade decays from the dominant crustal anti-electron neutrinos in\nChina.\n", "  We present ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the HH46/47 molecular outflow using\ncombined 12m array and ACA observations. The improved angular resolution and\nsensitivity of our multi-line maps reveal structures that help us study the\nentrainment process in much more detail and allow us to obtain more precise\nestimates of outflow properties than previous observations. We use 13CO(1-0)\nand C18O(1-0) emission to correct for the 12CO(1-0) optical depth to accurately\nestimate the outflow mass, momentum and kinetic energy. This correction\nincreases the estimates of the mass, momentum and kinetic energy by factors of\nabout 9, 5 and 2, respectively, with respect to estimates assuming optically\nthin emission. The new 13CO and C18O data also allow us to trace denser and\nslower outflow material than that traced by the 12CO maps, and they reveal an\noutflow cavity wall at very low velocities (as low as 0.2km/s with respect to\nthe cores central velocity). Adding with the slower material traced only by\n13CO and C18O, there is another factor of 3 increase in the mass estimate and\n50% increase in the momentum estimate. The estimated outflow properties\nindicate that the outflow is capable of dispersing the parent core within the\ntypical lifetime of the embedded phase of a low-mass protostar, and that it is\nresponsible for a core-to-star efficiency of 1/4 to 1/3. We find that the\noutflow cavity wall is composed of multiple shells associated with a series of\njet bow-shock events. Within about 3000AU of the protostar the 13CO and C18O\nemission trace a circumstellar envelope with both rotation and infall motions,\nwhich we compare with a simple analytic model. The CS(2-1) emission reveals\ntentative evidence of a slowly-moving rotating outflow, which we suggest is\nentrained not only poloidally but also toroidally by a disk wind that is\nlaunched from relatively large radii from the source.\n", "  We introduce the construction of a new framework for probing discrete\nemergent geometry and boundary-boundary observables based on a fundamentally\na-dimensional underlying network structure. Using a gravitationally motivated\naction with Forman weighted combinatorial curvatures and simplicial volumes\nrelying on a decomposition of an abstract simplicial complex into realized\nembeddings of proper skeletons, we demonstrate properties such as a minimal\nvolume-scale cutoff, the necessity of a positive-definite cosmological\nconstant-like term as a regulator for non-degenerate geometries, and naturally\nemergent simplicial structures from Metropolis network evolution simulations\nwith no restrictions on attachment rules or regular building blocks. We see\nemergent properties which echo results from both the spinfoam formalism and\ncausal dynamical triangulations in quantum gravity, and provide analytical and\nnumerical results to support the analogy. We conclude with a summary of open\nquestions and intent for future work in developing the program.\n", "  Topological Dirac semimetals (DSMs) exhibit nodal points through which energy\nbands disperse linearly in three-dimensional (3D) momentum space, a 3D analogue\nof graphene. The first experimentally confirmed DSMs with a pair of Dirac\npoints (DPs), Na$_{3}$Bi and Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$, show topological surface Fermi\narc states and exotic magneto-transport properties, boosting the interest in\nthe search for stable and nontoxic DSM materials. Here, based on the {\\it\nab-initio} band structure calculations we predict a family of palladium and\nplatinum oxides as robust 3D DSMs. The novel topological properties of these\ncompounds are distinct from all other previously reported DSMs, they are\nrendered by the multiple number of DPs in the compounds. We show that along\nthree unit axes of the cubic lattice there exist three pairs of DPs, which are\nlinked by Fermi arcs on the surface. The Fermi arcs display a Lifshitz\ntransition from a heart- to a diamond-shape upon varying the chemical\npotential. Corresponding oxides are already available as high-quality single\ncrystals, which is an excellent precondition for the verification of our\nprediction by photoemission and magneto-transport experiments. Our findings not\nonly predict a number of much robust 3D DSM candidates but also extend DSMs to\ntransition metal oxides, a versatile family of materials, which opens the door\nto investigate the interplay between DSMs and electronic correlations that is\nnot possible in the previously discovered DSM materials.\n", "  We present the discovery of 816 high amplitude infrared variable stars\n($\\Delta K_{\\rm s} >$ 1 mag) in 119 deg$^2$ of the Galactic midplane covered by\nthe Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey. Almost all are new\ndiscoveries and about 50$\\%$ are YSOs. This provides further evidence that YSOs\nare the commonest high amplitude infrared variable stars in the Galactic plane.\nIn the 2010-2014 time series of likely YSOs we find that the amplitude of\nvariability increases towards younger evolutionary classes (class I and\nflat-spectrum sources) except on short timescales ($<$25 days) where this trend\nis reversed. Dividing the likely YSOs by light curve morphology, we find 106\nwith eruptive light curves, 45 dippers, 39 faders, 24 eclipsing binaries, 65\nlong-term periodic variables (P$>$100 days) and 162 short-term variables.\nEruptive YSOs and faders tend to have the highest amplitudes and eruptive\nsystems have the reddest SEDs. Follow up spectroscopy in a companion paper\nverifies high accretion rates in the eruptive systems. Variable extinction is\ndisfavoured by the 2 epochs of colour data. These discoveries increase the\nnumber of eruptive variable YSOs by a factor of at least 5, most being at\nearlier stages of evolution than the known FUor and EXor types. We find that\neruptive variability is at least an order of magnitude more common in class I\nYSOs than class II YSOs. Typical outburst durations are 1 to 4 years, between\nthose of EXors and FUors. They occur in 3 to 6\\% of class I YSOs over a 4 year\ntime span.\n", "  In a companion work (Paper I) we detected a large population of highly\nvariable Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea\n(VVV) survey, typically with class I or flat spectrum spectral energy\ndistributions and diverse light curve types. Here we present infrared spectra\n(0.9--2.5 $\\mu$m) of 37 of these variables, many of them observed in a bright\nstate. The spectra confirm that 15/18 sources with eruptive light curves have\nsignatures of a high accretion rate, either showing EXor-like emission features\n($\\Delta$v=2 CO, Br$\\gamma$) and/or FUor-like features ($\\Delta$v=2 CO and\nH$_{2}$O strongly in absorption). Similar features were seen in some long term\nperiodic YSOs and faders but not in dippers or short-term variables. The sample\nincludes some dusty Mira variables (typically distinguished by smooth Mira-like\nlight curves), 2 cataclysmic variables and a carbon star. In total we have\nadded 19 new objects to the broad class of eruptive variable YSOs with episodic\naccretion. Eruptive variable YSOs in our sample that were observed at bright\nstates show higher accretion luminosities than the rest of the sample. Most of\nthe eruptive variables differ from the established FUor and EXor subclasses,\nshowing intermediate outburst durations and a mixture of their spectroscopic\ncharacteristics. This is in line with a small number of other recent\ndiscoveries. Since these previously atypical objects are now the majority\namongst embedded members of the class, we propose a new classification for them\nas MNors. This term (pronounced emnor) follows V1647 Ori, the illuminating star\nof McNeil's Nebula.\n", "  We consider a charged scalar field in a $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime\nand investigate pair creation by a Schwinger mechanism in a constant electric\nfield background. Using a semiclassical approximation the current of the\ncreated pairs has been estimated. We find that the semiclassical current of the\ncreated pairs in the strong electric field limit responds as $E^{\\frac{D}{2}}$.\nGoing further but restricting to $D=3$ dimensional de Sitter spacetime, the\nquantum expectation value of the spacelike component of the induced current has\nbeen computed in the in-vacuum state by applying an adiabatic subtraction\nscheme. We find that, in the strong electric field limit, the current responds\nas $E^{\\frac{3}{2}}$. In the weak electric field limit the current has a linear\nresponse in $E$ and an inverse dependence on the mass of the scalar field. In\nthe case of a massless scalar field, the current varies with $E^{-1}$ which\nleads to a phenomenon of infrared hyperconductivity. A new relation between\ninfrared hyperconductivity, tachyons, and conformality is discussed, and a\nscheme to avoid an infrared hyperconductivity regime is proposed. In $D$\ndimension, we eventually presented some first estimates of the backreaction of\nthe Schwinger pairs to the gravitational field, and we find a decrease of the\nHubble constant due to the pair creation.\n", "  We present a modal analysis of instabilities of counter-rotating,\nself-gravitating collisionless stellar discs, using the recently introduced\nmodified WKB formulation of spiral density waves for collisionless systems\n(Gulati \\& Saini). The discs are assumed to be axisymmetric and in coplanar\norbits around a massive object at the common center of the discs. The mass in\nboth discs is assumed to be much smaller than the mass of the central object.\nFor each disc, the disc particles are assumed to be in near circular orbits.\nThe two discs are coupled to each other gravitationally. The perturbed dynamics\nof the discs evolves on the order of the precession time scale of the discs,\nwhich is much longer than the Keplerian time scale. We present results for the\nazimuthal wave number $m=1$ and $m=2$, for the full range of disc mass ratio\nbetween the prograde and retrograde discs. The eigenspectra are in general\ncomplex, therefore all eigenmodes are unstable. Eigenfunctions are radially\nmore compact for $m = 1$ as compared to $m = 2$. Pattern speed of eigenmodes is\nalways prograde with respect to the more massive disc. The growth rate of\nunstable modes increases with increasing mass fraction in the retrograde disc,\nand decreases with $m$; therefore $m=1$ instability is likely to play the\ndominant role in the dynamics of such systems.\n", "  Recent N-body simulations predict that large numbers of stellar black holes\n(BHs) could remain bound to globular clusters (GCs) at present, and merging\nBH--BH binaries are produced dynamically in significant numbers. We\nsystematically vary \"standard\" assumptions made by numerical simulations\nrelated to, e.g., BH formation, stellar winds, binary properties of high-mass\nstars, and IMF within existing uncertainties, and study the effects on the\nevolution of the structural properties of GCs, and the BHs in GCs. We find that\nvariations in initial assumptions can set otherwise identical initial clusters\non completely different evolutionary paths, significantly affecting their\npresent observable properties, or even affecting the cluster's very survival to\nthe present. However, these changes usually do not affect the numbers or\nproperties of local BH--BH mergers. The only exception is that variations in\nthe assumed winds and IMF can change the masses and numbers of local BH--BH\nmergers, respectively. All other variations (e.g., in initial binary properties\nand binary fraction) leave the masses and numbers of locally merging BH--BH\nbinaries largely unchanged. This is in contrast to binary population synthesis\nmodels for the field, where results are very sensitive to many uncertain\nparameters in the initial binary properties and binary stellar-evolution\nphysics. We find that weak winds are required for producing GW150914-like\nmergers from GCs at low redshifts. LVT151012 can be produced in GCs modeled\nboth with strong and weak winds. GW151226 is lower-mass than typical mergers\nfrom GCs modeled with weak winds, but is similar to mergers from GCs modeled\nwith strong winds.\n", "  We present a resource-performance tradeoff of an all-optical quantum repeater\nthat uses photon sources, linear optics, photon detectors and classical\nfeedforward at each repeater node, but no quantum memories. We show that the\nquantum-secure key rate has the form $R(\\eta) = D\\eta^s$ bits per mode, where\n$\\eta$ is the end-to-end channel's transmissivity, and the constants $D$ and\n$s$ are functions of various device inefficiencies and the resource constraint,\nsuch as the number of available photon sources at each repeater node. Even with\nlossy devices, we show that it is possible to attain $s < 1$, and in turn\noutperform the maximum key rate attainable without quantum repeaters, $R_{\\rm\ndirect}(\\eta) = -\\log_2(1-\\eta) \\approx (1/\\ln 2)\\eta$ bits per mode for $\\eta\n\\ll 1$, beyond a certain total range $L$, where $\\eta \\sim e^{-\\alpha L}$ in\noptical fiber. We also propose a suite of modifications to a recently-proposed\nall-optical repeater protocol that ours builds upon, which lower the number of\nphoton sources required to create photonic clusters at the repeaters so as to\noutperform $R_{\\rm direct}(\\eta)$, from $\\sim 10^{11}$ to $\\sim 10^{6}$ photon\nsources per repeater node. We show that the optimum separation between repeater\nnodes is independent of the total range $L$, and is around $1.5$ km for\nassumptions we make on various device losses.\n", "  Structure and composition of iron chalcogenides have a delicate relationship\nwith magnetism and superconductivity. In this report we investigate the iron\nsulfide layered tetragonal phase (t-FeS), and compare with three-dimensional\nhexagonal phase (h-FeS). X-ray diffraction reveals the absence of structural\ntransitions for both t- and h-FeS below room temperature, and gives phase\ncompositions of Fe0.93(1)S and Fe0.84(1)S, respectively, for the samples\nstudied here. The a lattice parameter of bigger than 3.68 A is significant for\ncausing bulk superconductivity in iron sulfide, which is controlled by\ncomposition and structural details such as iron stoichiometry and concentration\nof vacancy. While h-FeS with a = 3.4436(1) A has magnetic ordering well above\nroom temperature, our t-FeS with a =3.6779(8)A shows filamentary\nsuperconductivity below Tc = 4 K with less than 15% superconducting volume\nfraction. Also for t-FeS, the magnetic susceptibility shows an anomaly at ~ 15\nK, and neutron diffraction reveals a commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering\nbelow TN = 116 K, with wave vector km= (0.25,0.25,0) and 0.46(2)uB/Fe. Although\ntwo synthesis routes are used here to stabilize t vs h crystal structures\n(hydrothermal vs solid-state methods), both FeS compounds order on two\nlength-scales of ~1000 nm sheets or blocks and ~ 20 nm smaller particles, shown\nby neutron scattering. First principles calculations reveal a high sensitivity\nto the structure for the electronic and magnetic properties in t-FeS,\npredicting marginal antiferromagnetic instability for our compound (sulfur\nheight of zS ~0.252) with an ordering energy of ~11 meV/Fe, while h-FeS is\nmagnetically stable.\n", "  We show that one can determine both parameters of a displacement acting on an\noscillator with an accuracy which scales inversely with the square root of the\nnumber of photons in the oscillator. Our results are obtained by using a grid\nstate as a sensor state for detecting small translations in phase space\n(displacements). Grid states were first proposed in (see\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.012310 ) for encoding a qubit into an\noscillator: an efficient preparation protocol of such states, using a coupling\nto a qubit, was developed in (see https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.93.012315 ).\nWe compare the performance of the grid state with the quantum compass or cat\ncode state and place our results in the context of the two-parameter quantum\nCram\\'er-Rao lower bound on the variances of the displacement parameters. We\nshow that the accessible information about the displacement for a grid state\nincreases with the number of photons in the state when we measure and prepare\nthe state using a phase estimation protocol. This is in contrast with the\naccessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is always\nupper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of photons. We present\nnumerical simulations of a phase estimation based preparation protocol of a\ngrid state in the presence of photon loss, nonlinearities and qubit\nmeasurement, using no post-selection, showing how the two effective squeezing\nparameters which characterize the grid state change during the preparation. The\nidea behind the phase estimation protocol is a simple maximal-information gain\nstrategy.\n", "  High redshift star-forming galaxies are likely responsible for the\nreionization of the Universe, yet direct detection of their escaping ionizing\n(Lyman continuum) photons has proven to be extremely challenging. In this\nstudy, we search for escaping Lyman continuum of the Cosmic Horseshoe, a\ngravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at z=2.38 with a large\nmagnification of $\\sim24$. Transmission at wavelengths of low ionization\ninterstellar absorption lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet suggest a patchy,\npartially transparent interstellar medium. This makes it an ideal candidate for\ndirect detection of the Lyman continuum. We obtained a 10-orbit Hubble near-UV\nimage using the WFC3/UVIS F275W filter that probes wavelengths just below the\nLyman limit at the redshift of the Horseshoe in an attempt to detect escaping\nLyman continuum radiation. After fully accounting for the uncertainties in the\nopacity of the intergalactic medium as well as accounting for the charge\ntransfer inefficiency in the WFC3 CCDs, we find a $3 \\sigma$ upper-limit for\nthe relative escape fraction of $f_{esc,rel}<0.08$. This value is a factor of\nfive lower than the value (0.4) predicted by the 40\\% transmission in the\nlow-ion absorption lines. We discuss the possible causes for this discrepancy\nand consider the implications for future attempts at both direct Lyman\ncontinuum detection as well as indirect estimates of the escape fraction.\n", "  We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic\nprocesses. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum\nsystem and runs in time almost linear in $\\sqrt{N \\beta/{\\cal Z}}$ and\npolynomial in $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$, where $N$ is the Hilbert space dimension,\n$\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, ${\\cal Z}$ is the partition function, and\n$\\epsilon$ is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm\nexponentially improves the dependence on $1/\\epsilon$ and quadratically\nimproves the dependence on $\\beta$ of known quantum algorithms for this\nproblem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For\na sparse stochastic matrix $P$, it runs in time almost linear in $1/(\\epsilon\n\\Delta^{3/2})$, where $\\epsilon$ is the absolute precision in the estimation\nand $\\Delta$ is a parameter determined by $P$, and whose inverse is an upper\nbound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the\ndependence on $1/\\epsilon$ and $1/\\Delta$ of the analog classical algorithm for\nhitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the\ncontext of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving\nlinear systems of equations.\n", "  Modifications of the electronic bands of thin FeSe films due to oxygen\nvacancies in the supporting SrTiO 3 (001) substrate - and the interplay with\nspin-orbit coupling, magnetism, and epitaxy - are investigated by\nfirst-principles supercell calculations. Unfolded (k-projected) bands show that\nthe oxygen vacancies both provide electron doping to the interface FeSe layer\nand also have notable effects on the details of the bands around the Fermi\nlevel, including renormalizing the width of the Fe-3d band near the Fermi level\nby a factor of about 0.6, and causing a splitting of ~40 meV at the M point for\nthe checkerboard antiferromagnetic configuration. For an FeSe bilayer, the\nmodifications to the bands are mainly limited to the interface FeSe layer.\nWhile spin-orbit-coupling induced band splittings of ~30 meV at M for the ideal\nFeSe/SrTiO3 (001) interfaces are comparable to the splitting due to oxygen\nvacancies, the effects are not simply additive. Calculations and comparison to\nour scanning tunneling microscopy images of MBE-grown FeSe films on SrTiO3\n(001) suggest that a common defect may be Se bound to an oxygen vacancy at the\ninterface\n", "  Comparison of the ISM properties of a wide range of metal-poor galaxies with\nnormal metal-rich galaxies reveals striking differences. We find that the\ncombination of the low dust abundance and the active star formation results in\na very porous ISM filled with hard photons, heating the dust in dwarf galaxies\nto overall higher temperatures than their metal-rich counterparts. This results\nin photodissociation of molecular clouds to greater depths, leaving relatively\nlarge PDR envelopes and difficult-to-detect CO cores. From detailed modeling of\nthe low-metallicity ISM, we find significant fractions of CO-dark H2 - a\nreservoir of molecular gas not traced by CO, but present in the [CII] and\n[CI]-emitting envelopes. Self-consistent analyses of the neutral and ionized\ngas diagnostics along with the dust SED is the necessary way forward in\nuncovering the multiphase structure of galaxies\n", "  The Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE)\nReactivation mission released data from its first full year of observations in\n2015. This data set includes ~2.5 million exposures in each of W1 and W2,\neffectively doubling the amount of WISE imaging available at 3.4 and 4.6\nmicrons relative to the AllWISE release. We have created the first ever\nfull-sky set of coadds combining all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures\nfrom both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation (NEOWISER) mission phases. We\nemploy an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework (Lang 2014),\nwhich preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced\nphotometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not\nonly improve the W1/W2 depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent\nartifacts such as off-axis scattered moonlight. We anticipate that our new\ncoadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection for\nupcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identification of distant/massive\ngalaxy clusters, and discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our\nfull-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will be an important input for the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) selection of luminous red galaxy and\nquasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam\nLegacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction\npipelines. Much more work still remains in order to fully leverage NEOWISER\nimaging for astrophysical applications beyond the solar system.\n", "  We present galaxy-galaxy lensing results from 139 square degrees of Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) Science Verification (SV) data. Our lens sample consists of\nred galaxies, known as redMaGiC, which are specifically selected to have a low\nphotometric redshift error and outlier rate. The lensing measurement has a\ntotal signal-to-noise of 29 over scales $0.09 < R < 15$ Mpc/$h$, including all\nlenses over a wide redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.8$. Dividing the lenses into\nthree redshift bins for this constant moving number density sample, we find no\nevidence for evolution in the halo mass with redshift. We obtain consistent\nresults for the lensing measurement with two independent shear pipelines, ngmix\nand im3shape. We perform a number of null tests on the shear and photometric\nredshift catalogs and quantify resulting systematic uncertainties. Covariances\nfrom jackknife subsamples of the data are validated with a suite of 50 mock\nsurveys. The results and systematics checks in this work provide a critical\ninput for future cosmological and galaxy evolution studies with the DES data\nand redMaGiC galaxy samples. We fit a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model,\nand demonstrate that our data constrains the mean halo mass of the lens\ngalaxies, despite strong degeneracies between individual HOD parameters.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of a nearby radio loud elliptical galaxy\nNGC708, selected from the Bologna B2 sample of radio galaxies. We obtained\noptical broad band and narrow images from IGO 2m telescope (Pune, India). We\nsupplement the multi-wavelength coverage of the observation by using X-ray data\nfrom Chandra, infrared data from 2MASS, Spitzer and WISE and optical image from\nDSS and HST. In order to investigate properties of interstellar medium, we have\ngenerated unsharp-masked, color, residual, quotient, dust extinction, H_alph\nemission maps. From the derived maps it is evident that cool gas, dust, warm\nionized H_alpha and hot X-ray gas are spatially associated with each other. We\ninvestigate the inner and outer photometric and kinematic properties of the\ngalaxy using surface brightness profiles. From X-ray 2d beta model, unsharp\nmasking, surface brightness profiles techniques, it is evident that pair of\nX-ray cavities are present in this system and which are ~5.6 Kpc away from the\ncentral X-ray source.\n", "  In one-dimensional electronic systems with strong repulsive interactions,\ncharge excitations propagate much faster than spin excitations. Such systems\ntherefore have an intermediate temperature range [termed the \"spin-incoherent\nLuttinger liquid'\" (SILL) regime] where charge excitations are \"cold\" (i.e.,\nhave low entropy) whereas spin excitations are \"hot.\" We explore the effects of\ncharge-sector disorder in the SILL regime in the absence of external sources of\nequilibration. We argue that the disorder localizes all charge-sector\nexcitations; however, spin excitations are protected against full localization,\nand act as a heat bath facilitating charge and energy transport on\nasymptotically long timescales. The charge, spin, and energy conductivities are\nwidely separated from one another. The dominant carriers of energy are neither\ncharge nor spin excitations, but neutral \"phonon\" modes, which undergo an\nunconventional form of hopping transport that we discuss. We comment on the\napplicability of these ideas to experiments and numerical simulations.\n", "  It is now well established that chemistry in external galaxies is rich and\ncomplex. In this review I will explore whether one can use molecular emissions\nto determine their physical conditions. There are several considerations to\nbear in mind when using molecular emission, and in particular molecular ratios,\nto determine the densities, temperatures and energetics of a galaxy, which I\nwill briefly summarise here. I will then present an example of a study that\nuses multiple chemical and radiative transfer analyses in order to tackle the\ntoo often neglected `degeneracies' implicit in the interpretation of molecular\nratios and show that only via such analyses combined with multi-species and\nmulti-lines high spatial resolution data one can truly make molecules into\npowerful diagnostics of the evolution and distribution of molecular gas.\n", "  We study, as a model of Lorentz symmetry breaking, the quantisation and\nrenormalisation of an extension of QED in a flat spacetime where the photons\nand electrons propagate differently and do not share the same lightcone. We\nwill refer to this model as Bimetric QED (BIMQED). As a preliminary we discuss\nthe formulation of electrodynamics in a pre-metric formalism showing\nnevertheless that there is, on the basis of a simple criteron, a preferred\nmetric. Arising from this choice of metric is a Weyl-like tensor (WLT). The\nPetrov classification of the WLT gives rise to a corresponding classification\nof Lorentz symmetry breaking. We do not impose any constraint on the strength\nof the symmetry breaking and are able to obtain explicit dispersion relations\nfor photon propagation in each of the Petrov classes. The associated\nbirefringence appears in some cases as two distinct polarisation dependent\nlightcones and in other cases as a a more complicated structure that cannot be\ndisentangled in a simple way.\n  We show how in BIMQED the renormalisation procedure can, in addition to its\neffect on standard parameters such as charge and mass, force the\nrenormalisation of the metrics and the WLT. Two particularly tractable cases\nare studied in detail for which we can obtain renormalisation group flows for\nthe parameters of the model together with an analysis of fixed point structure.\nOf course these results are consistent with previous studies but we are not\nconstrained to treat Lorentz symmetry breaking as necessarily weak. As we found\nin a previous study of a scalar field theory model an acceptable causal\nstructure for the model imposes constraints on relationship between the various\nlightcones in BIMQED.\n", "  The insulating state of matter can be probed by means of a ground state\ngeometrical marker, which is closely related to the modern theory of\npolarization (based on a Berry phase). In the present work we show that this\nmarker can be applied to determine the metal-insulator transition in disordered\nsystems. In particular, for non-interacting systems the geometrical marker can\nbe obtained from the configurational average of the norm-squared one-body\ndensity matrix, which can be calculated within open as well as periodic\nboundary conditions. This is in sharp contrast to a classification based on the\nstatic conductivity, which is only sensible within periodic boundary\nconditions. We exemplify the method by considering a simple lattice model,\nknown to have a metal-insulator transition as a function of the disorder\nstrength and demonstrate that the transition point can be obtained accurately\nfrom the one-body density matrix. The approach has a general {\\it ab-initio}\nformulation and can be applied to realistic disordered materials by standard\nelectronic structure methods.\n", "  We analyze positivity of a tensor product of two linear qubit maps, $\\Phi_1\n\\otimes \\Phi_2$. Positivity of maps $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ is a necessary but\nnot a sufficient condition for positivity of $\\Phi_1 \\otimes \\Phi_2$. We find a\nnon-trivial sufficient condition for positivity of the tensor product map\nbeyond the cases when both $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ are completely positive or\ncompletely co-positive. We find necessary and (separately) sufficient\nconditions for $n$-tensor-stable positive qubit maps, i.e. such qubit maps\n$\\Phi$ that $\\Phi^{\\otimes n}$ is positive. Particular cases of 2- and\n3-tensor-stable positive qubit maps are fully characterized, and the\ndecomposability of 2-tensor-stable positive qubit maps is discussed. The case\nof non-unital maps is reduced to the case of appropriate unital maps. Finally,\n$n$-tensor-stable positive maps are used in characterization of multipartite\nentanglement, namely, in the entanglement depth detection.\n", "  In this paper we propose a method to study the Functional Renormalization\nGroup at finite chemical potential. The method consists of mapping the FRG\nequations within the Fermi surface into a differential equation defined on a\nrectangle with zero boundary conditions. To solve this equation we use an\nexpansion of the potential in a harmonic basis. With this method we determined\nthe phase diagram of a simple Yukawa-type model; as expected, the bosonic\nfluctuations decrease the strength of the transition.\n", "  We explore the temporal evolution of flare plasma parameters including\ntemperature (T) - differential emission measure (DEM) relationship by analyzing\nhigh spectral and temporal cadence of X-ray emission in 1.6-8.0 keV energy\nband, recorded by SphinX (Polish) and Solar X-ray Spectrometer (SOXS; Indian)\ninstruments, during a B8.3 flare which occurred on July 04, 2009. SphinX\nrecords X-ray emission in 1.2-15.0 keV energy band with the temporal and\nspectral cadence as good as 6 microsecond and 0.4 keV, respectively. On the\nother hand, SOXS provides X-ray observations in 4-25 keV energy band with the\ntemporal and spectral resolution of 3 second and 0.7 keV, respectively. We\nderive the thermal plasma parameters during impulsive phase of the flare\nemploying well-established Withbroe-Sylwester DEM inversion algorithm.\n", "  Molecular Mechanics describes molecules as particle configurations\ninteracting via classical potentials. These {\\it configurational energies}\nusually consist of the sum of different phenomenological terms which are\ntailored to the description of specific bonding geometries. This approach is\nfollowed here to model the fullerene $C_{60}$, an allotrope of carbon\ncorresponding to a specific hollow spherical structure of sixty atoms. We\nrigorously address different modeling options and advance a set of minimal\nrequirements on the configurational energy able to deliver an accurate\nprediction of the fine three-dimensional geometry of $C_{60}$ as well as of its\nremarkable stability. In particular, the experimentally observed\ntruncated-icosahedron structure with two different bond lengths is shown to be\na strict local minimizer.\n", "  In this Letter, we address the longstanding challenge of how to reconstruct\nlinks in directed networks from measurements, and present a general method that\nmakes use of a noise-induced relation between network structure and both the\ntime-lagged covariance of measurements taken at two different times and the\ncovariance of measurements taken at the same time. For coupling functions that\nhave additional properties, we can further reconstruct the weights of the\nlinks.\n", "  Observations of flare emissions in the optical continuum are very rare.\nTherefore, the analysis of such observations is useful and may contribute to\nour understanding of the flaring chromosphere and photosphere. We study the\nwhite light continuum emission observed during the X6.9 flare which occurred on\nAugust 09, 2011. This emission comes not only from the flare ribbons but also\nfrom the nearby plage area. The main aim of this work is to disentangle the\nflare and plage (facula) emission. We analyzed the spatial, spectral and\ntemporal evolution of the flare and plage properties by analyzing\nmulti-wavelength observations. We study the morphological correlation of the\nwhitelight continuum emission observed with different instruments. We found\nthat some active region areas which produce the continuum emission correspond\nrather to plages than to the flare kernels. We showed that in some cases the\ncontinuum emission from the WL flare kernels is very similar to the continuum\nemission of faculae.\n", "  Quantum topological materials, exemplified by topological insulators,\nthree-dimensional Dirac semimetals and Weyl semimetals, have attracted much\nattention recently because of their unique electronic structure and physical\nproperties. Very lately it is proposed that the three-dimensional Weyl\nsemimetals can be further classified into two types. In the type I Weyl\nsemimetals, a topologically protected linear crossing of two bands, i.e., a\nWeyl point, occurs at the Fermi level resulting in a point-like Fermi surface.\nIn the type II Weyl semimetals, the Weyl point emerges from a contact of an\nelectron and a hole pocket at the boundary resulting in a highly tilted Weyl\ncone. In type II Weyl semimetals, the Lorentz invariance is violated and a\nfundamentally new kind of Weyl Fermions is produced that leads to new physical\nproperties. WTe2 is interesting because it exhibits anomalously large\nmagnetoresistance. It has ignited a new excitement because it is proposed to be\nthe first candidate of realizing type II Weyl Fermions. Here we report our\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) evidence on identifying the type II Weyl\nFermion state in WTe2. By utilizing our latest generation laser-based ARPES\nsystem with superior energy and momentum resolutions, we have revealed a full\npicture on the electronic structure of WTe2. Clear surface state has been\nidentified and its connection with the bulk electronic states in the momentum\nand energy space shows a good agreement with the calculated band structures\nwith the type II Weyl states. Our results provide spectroscopic evidence on the\nobservation of type II Weyl states in WTe2. It has laid a foundation for\nfurther exploration of novel phenomena and physical properties in the type II\nWeyl semimetals.\n", "  The drag and diffusion coefficients of heavy baryons ($\\Lambda_c$ and\n$\\Lambda_b$) in the hadronic phase created in the latter stage of the heavy-ion\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC energies have been evaluated recently. In this work\nwe compute some experimental observables, such as the nuclear suppression\nfactor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of heavy baryons at RHIC and LHC\nenergies, highlighting the role of the hadronic phase contribution to these\nobservables, which are going to be measured at Run 3 of LHC. For the time\nevolution of the heavy quarks in the QGP and heavy baryons in the hadronic\nphase we use the Langevin dynamics. For the hadronization of the heavy quarks\nto heavy baryons we employ Peterson fragmentation functions. We observe a\nstrong suppression of both the $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\Lambda_b$. We find that the\nhadronic medium has a sizable impact on the heavy-baryon elliptic flow whereas\nthe impact of hadronic medium rescattering is almost unnoticeable on the\nnuclear suppression factor. We evaluate the $\\Lambda_c/D$ ratio at RHIC and\nLHC. We find that $\\Lambda_c/D$ ratio remain unaffected due to the hadronic\nphase rescattering which enable it as a nobel probe of QGP phase dynamics along\nwith its hadronization.\n", "  We discuss new methods to integrate the cosmic ray (CR) evolution equations\ncoupled to magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) on an unstructured moving mesh, as\nrealised in the massively parallel AREPO code for cosmological simulations. We\naccount for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at resolved shocks and at\nsupernova remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), and follow the advective\nCR transport within the magnetised plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive\ntransport of CRs along the local magnetic field. CR losses are included in\nterms of Coulomb and hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find\nthat the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced\nCRs decreases the shock speed. However, CR acceleration at spherically\nexpanding blast waves does not significantly break the self-similarity of the\nSedov-Taylor solution; the resulting modifications can be approximated by a\nsuitably adjusted, but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the\nnew CR formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure\nformation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the ISM that\nincreases the vertical scale height of disk galaxies, and thus reduces the star\nformation rate. Strong external structure formation shocks inject CRs into the\ngas, but the relative pressure of this component decreases towards halo centres\nas adiabatic compression favours the thermal over the CR pressure.\n", "  For the past six years, the EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory has been monitoring changes in the Sun's extreme\nultraviolet output over a range of timescales. Its primary function is to\nprovide measurements of the solar spectral irradiance that is responsible for\ndriving fluctuations in Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. However, despite\nits modest spectral resolution and lack of spatial information, the EVE\nspectral range contains many lines and continua that have become invaluable for\ndiagnosing the response of the lower solar atmosphere itself to an injection of\nenergy, particularly during a flare's impulsive phase. In addition, high\ntemperature emission lines can also be used to track changes in temperature and\ndensity of flaring plasma in the corona. The high precision of EVE observations\nare therefore crucial in helping us understand particle acceleration and energy\ntransport mechanisms during solar flares, as well as the origins of the Sun's\nmost geoeffective emission.\n", "  We examine the possibility that dark matter consists of charged massive\nparticles (CHAMPs) in view of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies. The evolution of cosmological perturbations of CHAMP with other\ncomponents is followed in a self-consistent manner, without assuming that CHAMP\nand baryons are tightly coupled. We incorporate for the first time the \"kinetic\nre-coupling\" of the Coulomb scattering, which is characteristic of heavy\nCHAMPs. By a direct comparison of the predicted CMB temperature/polarization\nauto-correlations in CHAMP models and the observed spectra in the Planck\nmission, we show that CHAMPs leave sizable effects on CMB spectra if they are\nlighter than $10^{11}\\,{\\rm GeV}$. Our result can be applicable to any CHAMP as\nlong as its lifetime is much longer than the cosmic time at the recombination\n($\\sim 4 \\times 10^{5}\\, {\\rm yr}$). An application to millicharged particles\nis also discussed.\n", "  Let $Q(X)$ be any integral primitive positive definite quadratic form with\ndiscriminant $D$ and in $k$ variables where $k\\geq4$. We give an upper bound on\nthe number of integral solutions of $Q(X)=n$ for any integer $n$ in terms of\n$n$, $k$ and $D$. As a corollary, we give a definite answer to a conjecture of\nRudnick and Lester on the small scale equidistribution of orthonormal basis of\neigenfunctions restricted to an individual eigenspace on the flat torus\n$\\mathbb{T}^d$ for $d\\geq 5$. Another application of our main theorem gives a\nsharp upper bound on $A_{d}(n,t)$, the number of representation of the positive\ndefinite quadratic form $Q(x,y)=nx^2+2txy+ny^2$ as a sum of squares of $d\\geq\n5$ linear forms where $n- n^{\\frac{1}{(d-1)}-o(1)}< t < n$. This upper bound\nallows us to study the local statistics of integral points on sphere.\n", "  It is found that the differential cross section of photon-photon scattering\nis a function of the degree of polarization entanglement of the two-photon\nstate. A reduced, general expression for the differential cross section of\nphoton-photon scattering is derived by applying simple symmetry arguments. An\nexplicit expression is obtained for the example of photon-photon scattering due\nto virtual electron-positron pairs in Quantum Electrodynamics. It is shown how\nthe effect in this explicit example can be explained as an effect of quantum\ninterference and that it fits with the idea of distance-dependent forces.\n", "  Frequency conversion of non-classical light enables robust encoding of\nquantum information based upon spectral multiplexing that is particularly\nwell-suited to integrated-optics platforms. Here we present an intrinsically\ndeterministic linear-optics approach to spectral shearing of quantum light\npulses and show it preserves the wave-packet coherence and quantum nature of\nlight. The technique is based upon an electro-optic Doppler shift to implement\nfrequency shear of heralded single-photon wave packets by $\\pm 200$ GHz, which\ncan be scaled to an arbitrary shift. These results demonstrate a\nreconfigurable, unitary method to controlling the spectral-temporal mode\nstructure of quantum light.\n", "  We investigate sub-monolayer InN quantum sheets embedded in GaN(0001) by\ntemperature-dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy under both continuous-wave\nand pulsed excitation. Both the peak energy and the linewidth of the emission\nband associated with the quantum sheets exhibit an anomalous dependence on\ntemperature indicative of carrier localization. Photoluminescence transients\nreveal a power law decay at low temperatures reflecting that the recombining\nelectrons and holes occupy spatially separate, individual potential minima\nreminiscent of conventional (In,Ga)N(0001) quantum wells exhibiting the\ncharacteristic disorder of a random alloy. At elevated temperatures, carrier\ndelocalization sets in and is accompanied by a thermally activated quenching of\nthe emission. We ascribe the strong nonradiative recombination to extended\nstates in the GaN barriers and confirm our assumption by a simple rate-equation\nmodel.\n", "  We consider gravitational wave production by bubble collisions during a\ncosmological first-order phase transition. In the literature, such spectra have\nbeen estimated by simulating the bubble dynamics, under so-called thin-wall and\nenvelope approximations in a flat background metric. However, we show that,\nwithin these assumptions, the gravitational wave spectrum can be estimated in\nan analytic way. Our estimation is based on the observation that the two-point\ncorrelator of the energy-momentum tensor $\\langle T(x)T(y)\\rangle$ can be\nexpressed analytically under these assumptions. Though the final expressions\nfor the spectrum contain a few integrations that cannot be calculated\nexplicitly, we can easily estimate it numerically. As a result, it is found\nthat the most of the contributions to the spectrum come from single-bubble\ncontribution to the correlator, and in addition the fall-off of the spectrum at\nhigh frequencies is found to be proportional to $f^{-1}$. We also provide\nfitting formulae for the spectrum.\n", "  It is well known that a closed loop of magnetic dipoles can give rise to the\nrather elusive toroidal moment. However, artificial structures required to\ngenerate the necessary magnetic moments are typically optically large, complex\nto make and easily compromised by the kinetic inductance at high frequencies.\nInstead of using magnetic dipoles, we propose a minimal model based on just\nthree aligned discrete electric dipoles in which the occurrence of resonant\ntoroidal modes is guaranteed by symmetry. The advantage of this model is its\nsimplicity and the same model supports toroidal moments from the microwave\nregime up to optical frequencies as exemplified by a three-antenna array and a\nsystem consisting of three nano-sized plasmonic particles. Both the microwave\nand high-frequency configurations exhibit non-radiating \"anapoles\". Experiments\nin the microwave regime confirm the theoretical predictions.\n", "  Radiative corrections to elastic electron-proton scattering are analyzed in\neffective field theory. A new factorization formula identifies all sources of\nlarge logarithms in the limit of large momentum transfer, $Q^2\\gg m_e^2$.\nExplicit matching calculations are performed through two-loop order. A\nrenormalization analysis in soft-collinear effective theory is performed to\nsystematically compute and resum large logarithms. Implications for the\nextraction of charge radii and other observables from scattering data are\ndiscussed. The formalism may be applied to other lepton-nucleon scattering and\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation processes.\n", "  During late October 2014, active region NOAA 2192 caused an unusual high\nlevel of solar activity, within an otherwise weak solar cycle. While crossing\nthe solar disk, during a period of 11 days, it was the source of 114 flares of\nGOES class C1.0 and larger, including 29 M- and 6 X-flares. Surprisingly, none\nof the major flares (GOES class M5.0 and larger) was accompanied by a coronal\nmass ejection, contrary to statistical tendencies found in the past. From\nmodeling the coronal magnetic field of NOAA 2192 and its surrounding, we\nsuspect that the cause of the confined character of the flares is the strong\nsurrounding and overlying large-scale magnetic field. Furthermore, we find\nevidence for multiple magnetic reconnection processes within a single flare,\nduring which electrons were accelerated to unusual high energies.\n", "  We conducted an extensive CCD search for faint, unresolved dwarf galaxies of\nvery low surface brightness in the whole Centaurus group region encompassing\nthe Cen A and M 83 subgroups lying at a distance of roughly 4 and 5 Mpc,\nrespectively. The aim is to significantly increase the sample of known\nCentaurus group members down to a fainter level of completeness, serving as a\nbasis for future studies of the 3D structure of the group. Following our\nprevious survey of 60 square degrees covering the M 83 subgroup, we extended\nand completed our survey of the Centaurus group region by imaging another 500\nsquare degrees area in the g and r bands with the wide-field Dark Energy Survey\nCamera at the 4m Blanco telescope at CTIO. The limiting central surface\nbrightness reached for suspected Centaurus members is $\\mu_r \\approx 29$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, corresponding to an absolute magnitude $M_r \\approx -9.5$. The\nimages were enhanced using different filtering techniques. We found 41 new\ndwarf galaxy candidates, which together with the previously discovered 16 dwarf\ncandidates in the M 83 subgroup amounts to almost a doubling of the number of\nknown galaxies in the Centaurus complex, if the candidates are confirmed. We\ncarried out surface photometry in g and r, and report the photometric\nparameters derived therefrom, for all new candidates as well as previously\nknown members in the surveyed area. The photometric properties of the\ncandidates, when compared to those of LG dwarfs and previously known Centaurus\ndwarfs, suggest membership in the Centaurus group. The sky distribution of the\nnew objects is generally following a common envelope around the Cen A and M 83\nsubgroups. How the new dwarfs are connected to the intriguing double-planar\nfeature recently reported by Tully et al. (2015) must await distance\ninformation for the candidates.\n", "  We present the latest version of Pinocchio, a code that generates catalogues\nof DM haloes in an approximate but fast way with respect to an N-body\nsimulation. This code version extends the computation of particle and halo\ndisplacements up to 3rd-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT), in contrast\nwith previous versions that used Zeldovich approximation (ZA).\n  We run Pinocchio on the same initial configuration of a reference N-body\nsimulation, so that the comparison extends to the object-by-object level. We\nconsider haloes at redshifts 0 and 1, using different LPT orders either for\nhalo construction - where displacements are needed to decide particle accretion\nonto a halo or halo merging - or to compute halo final positions.\n  We compare the clustering properties of Pinocchio haloes with those from the\nsimulation by computing the power spectrum and 2-point correlation function\n(2PCF) in real and redshift space (monopole and quadrupole), the bispectrum and\nthe phase difference of halo distributions. We find that 2LPT and 3LPT give\nnoticeable improvement. 3LPT provides the best agreement with N-body when it is\nused to displace haloes, while 2LPT gives better results for constructing\nhaloes. At the highest orders, linear bias is typically recovered at a few per\ncent level.\n  In Fourier space and using 3LPT for halo displacements, the halo power\nspectrum is recovered to within 10 per cent up to $k_{max}\\sim0.5\\ h/$Mpc. The\nresults presented in this paper have interesting implications for the\ngeneration of large ensemble of mock surveys aimed at accurately compute\ncovariance matrices for clustering statistics.\n", "  One of the simplest extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is the addition of\na scalar gauge singlet, S. If S is not forbidden by a symmetry from mixing with\nthe Standard Model Higgs boson, the mixing will generate non-SM rates for Higgs\nproduction and decays. In general, there could also be unknown high energy\nphysics that generates additional effective low energy interactions. We show\nthat interference effects between the scalar resonance of the singlet model and\nthe effective field theory (EFT) operators can have significant effects in the\nHiggs sector. We examine a non-$Z_2$ symmetric scalar singlet model and\ndemonstrate that a fit to the 125 GeV Higgs boson couplings and to limits on\nhigh mass resonances, S, exhibit an interesting structure and possible large\ncancellations of effects between the resonance contribution and the new EFT\ninteractions, that invalidate conclusions based on the renormalizable singlet\nmodel alone.\n", "  Experiments and simulations are used to study the kinetics of crystal growth\nin a mixture of magnetic and nonmagnetic particles suspended in ferrofluid. The\ngrowth process is quantified using both a bond order parameter and a mean\ndomain size parameter. The largest single crystals obtained in experiments\nconsist of approximately 1000 particles and form if the area fraction is held\nbetween 65-70% and the field strength is kept in the range of 8.5-10.5 Oe.\nSimulations indicate that much larger single crystals containing as many as\n5000 particles can be obtained in impurity-free conditions within a few hours.\nIf our simulations are modified to include impurity concentrations as small as\n1-2%, then the results agree quantitatively with the experiments. These\nfindings provide an important step toward developing strategies for growing\nsingle crystals that are large enough to enable follow-on investigations across\nmany subdisciplines in condensed matter physics.\n", "  We trace the evolution and the star formation history of passive galaxies,\nusing a subset of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). We\nextracted from the VIPERS survey a sample of passive galaxies in the redshift\nrange 0.4<z<1.0 and stellar mass range 10<$log(M_{star}/M_{\\odot})$<12. The\nsample was selected using an evolving cut in the rest-frame U-V color\ndistribution and additional quality-ensuring cuts. We use the stacked spectra\nto measure the 4000$\\AA$ break (D4000) and the $H\\delta$ Lick index\n($H\\delta_{A}$) with high precision. We compare the results with a grid of\nsynthetic spectra to constrain the star formation epochs of these galaxies. We\ncharacterize the formation redshift-stellar mass relation for\nintermediate-redshift passive galaxies. We find that at $z\\sim1$ stellar\npopulations in low-mass passive galaxies are younger than in high-mass passive\ngalaxies, similarly to what is observed at the present epoch. Over the full\nanalyzed redshift and stellar mass range, the $D4000$ index increases with\nredshift, while $H\\delta_{A}$ gets lower. This implies that the stellar\npopulations are getting older with increasing stellar mass. Comparison to the\nspectra of passive galaxies in the SDSS survey shows that the shape of the\nrelations of $D4000$, and $H\\delta_{A}$ with stellar mass has not changed\nsignificantly with redshift. Assuming a single burst formation, this implies\nthat high-mass passive galaxies formed their stars at $z_{form}\\sim2$, while\nlow-mass galaxies formed their main stellar population more recently, at\n$z_{form}\\sim1$. The consistency of these results, obtained using two\nindependent estimator of the formation redshift ($D4000$ and $H\\delta_{A}$),\nfurther strengthens a scenario in which star formation proceeds from higher- to\nlower-mass systems as time passes, i.e. what has become known as the\n'downsizing' picture.\n", "  The ESR (Electron Spin Resonance) spectrum of the XXZ spin chain with finite\nlength shows a double-peak structure at high temperatures around the EPR\n(Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) resonance frequency. This fact has been\npointed out by direct numerical methods (S. El Shawish, O. Cepas and S.\nMiyashita; H. Ikeuchi, H. De Raedt, S. Bertaina and S. Miyashita). On the other\nhand, at low temperatures the spectrum has a single peak with a finite shift\nfrom the frequency of EPR as predicted by the analysis of field theoretical\nworks (M. Oshikawa and I. Affleck). We study how the spectrum changes with the\ntemperature, and also we study the size-dependence of the line shape including\nthe even-odd effect. In order to understand those dependences, we introduce a\ndecomposition of the spectrum into contributions from transitions specified by\nmagnetization, and we characterize the structure of the spectrum by individual\ncontributions. Applying the moment method introduced by M. Brockman et al., to\neach component, we analyze the size-dependence of the structure of the\nspectrum, which supports the numerical observation that separation of the\ndouble-peak structure vanishes inversely with the size.\n", "  Feynman's time-slicing construction approximates the path integral by a\nproduct, determined by a partition of a finite time interval, of approximate\npropagators. This paper formulates general conditions to impose on a short-time\napproximation to the propagator in a general class of imaginary-time quantum\nmechanics on a Riemannian manifold which ensure these products converge. The\nlimit defines a path integral which agrees pointwise with the heat kernel for a\ngeneralized Laplacian. The result is a rigorous construction of the propagator\nfor supersymmetric quantum mechanics, with potential, as a path integral.\nFurther, the class of Laplacians includes the square of the twisted Dirac\noperator, which corresponds to an extension of N=1/2 supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics. General results on the rate of convergence of the approximate path\nintegrals suffice in this case to derive the local version of the Atiyah-Singer\nindex theorem.\n", "  A model of pearlite colony formation in carbon steels with ab-initio\nparameterization is proposed. The model describes the process of decomposition\nof austenite and cementite formation through a metastable intermediate\nstructure by taking into account the increase of the magnetic order under the\ncooling. Autocatalytic mechanism of pearlite colony formation and the\nconditions for its implementation have been analyzed. We demonstrate that\npearlite with lamellar structure is formed by autocatalytic mechanism when\nthermodynamic equilibrium between the initial phase (austenite) and the\nproducts of its decomposition (cementite and ferrite) does not take place. By\nusing model expression for free energy with first-principles parameterization\nwe find conditions of formation of both lamellar and globular structures, in\nagreement with experiment. The transformation diagram is suggested and\ndifferent scenarios in the kinetics of decomposition are investigated by phase\nfield simulations.\n", "  The possibility of quantum computing with spins in germanium nanoscale\ntransistors has recently attracted interest since it promises highly tuneable\nqubits that have encouraging coherence times. We here present the first\ncomplete theory of the orbital states of Ge donor electrons, and use it to show\nthat Ge could have significant advantages over silicon in the implementation of\na donor-based quantum processor architecture. We show that the stronger\nspin-orbit interaction and the larger electron donor wave functions for Ge\ndonors allow for greater tuning of the single qubit energy than for those in Si\ncrystals, thus enabling a large speedup of selective (local) quantum gates.\nFurther, exchange coupling between neighboring donor qubits is shown to be much\nlarger in Ge than in Si, and we show that this greatly relaxes the precision in\ndonor placement needed for robust two-qubit gates. To do this we compare two\nstatistical distributions for Ge:P and Si:P pair couplings, corresponding to\nrealistic donor implantation misplacement, and find that the spin couplings in\nGe:P have a $33\\%$ chance of being within an order of magnitude of the largest\ncoupling, compared with only $10\\%$ for the Si:P donors. This allows fast,\nparallel and robust architectures for quantum computing with donors in Ge.\n", "  We propose an ab-initio molecular dynamics method, capable to reduce\ndramatically the autocorrelation time required for the simulation of classical\nand quantum particles at finite temperature. The method is based on an\nefficient implementation of a first order\n  Langevin dynamics modified by means of a suitable, position dependent\nacceleration matrix $S$. Here we apply this technique, within a Quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) based wavefuntion approach and within the Born-Oppheneimer\napproximation, for determining the phase diagram of high-pressure Hydrogen with\nsimulations much longer than the autocorrelation time. With the proposed\nmethod, we are able to equilibrate in few hundreds steps even close to the\nliquid-liquid phase transition (LLT).\n  Within our approach we find that the LLT transition is consistent with recent\ndensity functionals predicting a much larger transition pressures when the long\nrange dispersive forces are taken into account.\n", "  The single-impurity Anderson model is studied within the i-DFT framework, a\nrecently proposed extension of density functional theory (DFT) for the\ndescription of electron transport in the steady state. i-DFT is designed to\ngive both the steady current and density at the impurity, and it requires the\nknowledge of the exchange-correlation (xc) bias and on-site potential (gate).\nIn this work we construct an approximation for both quantities which is\naccurate in a wide range of temperatures, gates and biases, thus providing a\nsimple and unifying framework to calculate the differential conductance at\nnegligible computational cost in different regimes. Our results mark a\nsubstantial advance for DFT and may inform the construction of functionals\napplicable to other correlated systems.\n", "  Lepton flavour universality (LFU) in B-decays is revisited by considering a\nclass of semileptonic operators defined at a scale Lambda above the electroweak\nscale v. The importance of quantum effects, so far neglected in the literature,\nis emphasised. We construct the low-energy effective Lagrangian taking into\naccount the running effects from Lambda down to v through the one-loop\nrenormalization group equations (RGE) in the limit of exact electroweak\nsymmetry and QED RGEs from v down to the 1 GeV scale. The most important\nquantum effects turn out to be the modification of the leptonic couplings of\nthe vector boson Z and the generation of a purely leptonic effective\nLagrangian. Large LFU breaking effects in Z and tau decays and visible lepton\nflavour violating (LFV) effects in the processes tau -> mu ll, tau -> mu rho,\ntau -> mu pi and tau -> mu eta^(') are induced.\n", "  We present a model of a topological semimetal in three dimensions (3D) whose\nenergy spectrum exhibits a nodal line acting as a vortex ring; this in turn is\nlinked by a pseudospin structure akin to that of a smoke ring. Contrary to a\nWeyl point node spectrum, the vortex ring gives rise to skyrmionic pseudospin\npatterns in cuts on both sides of the nodal ring plane; this pattern covers the\nfull Brillouin zone, thus leading to a new, `maximal', anomalous Hall effect in\na 3D semimetal. Tuning a model parameter shrinks the vortex ring until it\nvanishes, giving way to a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This\nestablishes a connection between two distinct momentum-space topologies - that\nof a vortex ring (a circle of singularity) and a monopole-anti-monopole pair\n(two point singularities). We present the model both as a low-energy continuum\nand a two-band tight-binding lattice model. Its simplicity permits an\nanalytical computation of its Landau level spectrum.\n", "  The effect of the strong $\\bar{\\rm p}$-p nuclear interaction in a\nthree-charge-particle system with arbitrary masses is investigated.\nSpecifically, the ($\\bar{\\rm p},\\ \\mu^-$,\\ p) system is considered, where\n$\\bar{p}$ is an antiproton, $\\mu^-$ is a muon and p is a proton. A numerical\ncomputation in the framework of a detailed few-body approach is carried out for\nthe following protonium (antiprotonic hydrogen) formation three-body reaction:\n$\\bar{p} + H_{\\mu}(1s) \\rightarrow (\\bar{p} p)_{\\alpha} + \\mu^-$. Here,\n$H_{\\mu}(1s)$ is a ground state muonic hydrogen, i.e. a bound state of p and\n$\\mu^-$. A bound state of $p$ and its counterpart $\\bar{p}$ is a protonium atom\nin a quantum atomic state $\\alpha$, i.e. $Pn = (\\bar{p}p)_{\\alpha}$. The\nlow-energy cross sections and rates of the $Pn$ formation reaction are computed\nin the framework of a Faddeev-like equation. The strong $\\bar{\\rm p}$-p\ninteraction is included in these calculations within a first order\napproximation. It was found, that even in the framework of this approximation\nthe inclusion of the strong interaction results in a quite significant\ncorrection to the rate of the three-body reaction. Therefore, the title\nthree-body antiprotonic process with participation of muons should be useful,\nespecially at low-energy collisions, in studying the $\\bar{\\rm p}$-p nuclear\nforces and the annihilation channels in $Pn$.\n", "  Future cosmological surveys will probe the expansion history of the universe\nand constrain phenomenological models of dark energy. Such models do not\naddress the fine-tuning problem of the vacuum energy, i.e. the cosmological\nconstant problem (c.c.p.), but can make it spectacularly worse. We show that\nthis is the case for 'interacting dark energy' models in which the masses of\nthe dark matter states depend on the dark energy sector. If realised in nature,\nthese models have far-reaching implications for proposed solutions to the\nc.c.p. that require the number of vacua to exceed the fine-tuning of the vacuum\nenergy density. We show that current estimates of the number of flux vacua in\nstring theory, $N_{\\rm vac} \\sim {\\cal O}(10^{272,000})$, is far too small to\nrealise certain simple models of interacting dark energy \\emph{and} solve the\ncosmological constant problem anthropically. These models admit distinctive\nobservational signatures that can be targeted by future gamma-ray\nobservatories, hence making it possible to observationally rule out the\nanthropic solution to the cosmological constant problem in theories with a\nfinite number of vacua.\n", "  The understanding and prediction of information diffusion processes on\nnetworks is a major challenge in network theory with many implications in\nsocial sciences. Many theoretical advances occurred due to stochastic spreading\nmodels. Nevertheless, these stochastic models overlooked the influence of\nrational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different\nlevels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and\nactors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion\nprocess accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the\ndecision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between\nthe propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer\nmultiplex network. Actors' trustable or untrustable states are defined as\naccumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner's\nDilemma set up, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of\ninformation is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading\nlayer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis\nof the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of\nprevious actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For\nexample, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion.\nInformation is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances.\nThese results provide insight into the effect of plausible biases on spreading\ndynamics in a multilevel networked system.\n", "  We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 GHz maps which\ninclude all data taken by the BICEP2 & Keck Array CMB polarization experiments\nup to and including the 2014 observing season (BK14). Despite their modest\nangular resolution ($\\sim 0.5^\\circ$), the excellent sensitivity ($\\sim\n3\\mu$K-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the\nlensing potential using only information at larger angular scales ($\\ell\\leq\n700$). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential we measure an\namplitude of the spectrum to be $A^{\\phi\\phi}_{\\rm L}=1.15\\pm 0.36$ (Planck\n$\\Lambda$CDM prediction corresponds to $A^{\\phi\\phi}_{\\rm L}=1$), and reject\nthe no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8$\\sigma$, which is the highest significance\nachieved to date using an EB lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of\nthe reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields\n$A^{\\phi\\phi}_{\\rm L}=1.13\\pm 0.20$. These direct measurements of\n$A^{\\phi\\phi}_{\\rm L}$ are consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and with\nthat derived from the previously reported BK14 B-mode auto-spectrum ($A^{\\rm\nBB}_{\\rm L}=1.20\\pm 0.17$). We perform a series of null tests and consistency\nchecks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are\ninsensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that\nthe B-modes previously reported by BICEP / Keck at intermediate angular scales\n($150\\lesssim\\ell\\lesssim 350$) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The\ngood agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing\nreconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any\nalternative cosmological sources of B-modes at these angular scales.\n", "  Post-selection strategies have been proposed with the aim of amplifying weak\nsignals, which may help to overcome detection thresholds associated with\ntechnical noise in high-precision measurements. Here we use an optical setup to\nexperimentally explore two different post-selection protocols for the\nestimation of a small parameter: a weak-value amplification procedure and an\nalternative method, that does not provide amplification, but nonetheless is\nshown to be more robust for the sake of parameter estimation. Each technique\nleads approximately to the saturation of quantum limits for the estimation\nprecision, expressed by the Cram\\'er-Rao bound. For both situations, we show\nthat information on the parameter is obtained jointly from the measuring device\nand the post-selection statistics.\n", "  Based on a sample of $1.31 \\times 10^9$ $J/\\psi$ events collected with the\nBESIII detector, an amplitude analysis of the isospin-violating decays\n$\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ and $\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow\n\\pi^0\\pi^0\\pi^0$ is performed. A significant $P$-wave contribution from\n$\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow \\rho^{\\pm} \\pi^{\\mp}$ is observed for the first time\nin $\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$. The branching fraction is\ndetermined to be ${\\mathcal B}(\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow\n\\rho^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp})=(7.44\\pm0.60\\pm1.26\\pm1.84)\\times 10^{-4}$, where the\nfirst uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic, and the third model\ndependent. In addition to the nonresonant $S$-wave component, there is a\nsignificant $\\sigma$ meson component. The branching fractions of the combined\n$S$-wave components are determined to be ${\\mathcal B}(\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow\n\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0)_S=(37.63\\pm0.77\\pm2.22\\pm4.48)\\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\\mathcal\nB}(\\eta^\\prime \\rightarrow \\pi^0\\pi^0\\pi^0)=(35.22\\pm0.82\\pm2.54)\\times\n10^{-4}$, respectively. The latter one is consistent with previous BESIII\nmeasurements.\n", "  The vast majority of well studied giant-planet systems, including the Solar\nSystem, are nearly coplanar which implies dissipation within a primordial gas\ndisk. however, intrinsic instability may lead to planet-planet scattering,\nwhich often produces non-coplanar, eccentric orbits. Planet scattering theories\nhave been developed to explain observed high eccentricity systems and also hot\nJupiters; thus far their predictions for mutual inclination (I) have barely\nbeen tested. Here we characterize a highly mutually-inclined (I ~ 15-60\ndegrees), moderately eccentric (e >~ 0.1) giant planet system: Kepler-108. This\nsystem consists of two approximately Saturn-mass planets with periods of ~49\nand ~190 days around a star with a wide (~300AU) binary companion in an orbital\nconfiguration inconsistent with a purely disk migration origin.\n", "  Using the microscopic-macroscopic model based on the deformed Woods-Saxon\nsingle-particle potential and the Yukawa-plus-exponential macroscopic energy we\ncalculated static fission barriers $B_{f}$ for 1305 heavy and superheavy nuclei\n$98\\leq Z \\leq 126$, including even - even, odd - even, even - odd and odd -\nodd systems. For odd and odd-odd nuclei, adiabatic potential energy surfaces\nwere calculated by a minimization over configurations with one blocked neutron\nor/and proton on a level from the 10-th below to the 10-th above the Fermi\nlevel. The parameters of the model that have been fixed previously by a fit to\nmasses of even-even heavy nuclei were kept unchanged. A search for saddle\npoints has been performed by the \"Imaginary Water Flow\" method on a basic\nfive-dimensional deformation grid, including triaxiality. Two auxiliary grids\nwere used for checking the effects of the mass asymmetry and hexadecapole\nnon-axiallity. The ground states were found by energy minimization over\nconfigurations and deformations. We find that the non-axiallity significantly\nchanges first and second fission barrier in many nuclei. The effect of the mass\n- asymmetry, known to lower the second, very deformed barriers in actinides, in\nthe heaviest nuclei appears at the less deformed saddles in more than 100\nnuclei. It happens for those saddles in which the triaxiallity does not play\nany role, what suggests a decoupling between effects of the mass-asymmetry and\ntriaxiality. We studied also the influence of the pairing interaction strength\non the staggering of $B_f$ for odd- and even-particle numbers. Finally, we\nprovide a comparison of our results with other theoretical fission barrier\nevaluations and with available experimental estimates.\n", "  The amplitude of fluctuation-induced patterns might be expected to be\nproportional to the strength of the driving noise, suggesting that such\npatterns would be difficult to observe in nature. Here, we show that a large\nclass of spatially-extended dynamical systems driven by intrinsic noise can\nexhibit giant amplification, yielding patterns whose amplitude is comparable to\nthat of deterministic Turing instabilities. The giant amplification results\nfrom the interplay between noise and non-orthogonal eigenvectors of the linear\nstability matrix, yielding transients that grow with time, and which, when\ndriven by the ever-present intrinsic noise, lead to persistent large amplitude\npatterns. This mechanism provides a robust basis for fluctuation-induced\nbiological pattern formation based on the Turing mechanism, without requiring\nfine tuning of diffusion constants.\n", "  The ability to troubleshoot is an important learning outcome for\nundergraduate physics laboratory courses. To better understand the role of\ntroubleshooting in electronics laboratory courses, we interviewed 20\nelectronics instructors from multiple institution types about their beliefs and\nteaching practices related to troubleshooting. In these interviews, instructors\narticulated the idea that \\emph{nothing works the first time} in multiple\ncontexts pertaining to troubleshooting. We argue that this idea is an expert\nepistemology and show how it informs instructors' beliefs that (i) students\nneed to know how to troubleshoot, (ii) students should expect to troubleshoot,\n(iii) all circuit-building lab activities provide opportunities for students to\ntroubleshoot, and (iv) students' ability to construct functional circuits can\nbe a proxy for their ability to troubleshoot malfunctioning circuits. Moreover,\nwe discuss implications for instruction and assessment of troubleshooting in\nelectronics courses.\n", "  We present theoretical study of ordering phenomena in binary $C_{1-x}B_{x}$,\n$C_{1-x}N_{x}$ and ternary $B_{x}C_{1-x-y}N_{y}$ alloys forming\ntwo-dimensional, graphene-like systems. For calculating energy of big systems\n(20 000 atoms in the supercell with periodic boundary conditions assumed)\nempirical Tersoff potential was employed. In order to find equilibrium\ndistribution of different species corresponding to minima of the energy, we use\nMonte Carlo approach in Metropolis regime. We take into consideration wide\nrange of concentrations (1-50%) and temperatures (70-1500 K), to provide more\ncomplete picture. For quantitative description of order, we determine\nWarren-Cowley Short Range Order (SRO) parameters for the first coordination\nshell. This procedure allows us to determine energetically favorable\ncompositions of all alloys, and characterize resulting types of order for both\nbinary and ternary systems.\n", "  Most next-generation Li-ion battery chemistries require a functioning lithium\nmetal (Li) anode. However, its application in secondary batteries has been\ninhibited because of uncontrollable dendrite growth during cycling. Mechanical\nsuppression of dendrite growth through solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) or\nthrough robust separators has shown the most potential for alleviating this\nproblem. Studies of the mechanical behavior of Li at any length scale and\ntemperature are virtually non-existent because of its extreme reactivity, which\nrenders sample preparation, transfer, microstructure characterization and\nmechanical testing prohibitively challenging. We conduct nano-mechanical\nexperiments in an in-situ Scanning Electron Microscope and show that\nmicron-sized Li attains extremely high strengths of 105 MPa at room temperature\nand of 35MPa at 90$^\\circ$C. We demonstrate that single crystalline Li exhibits\na power-law size-effect at the micron- and sub-micron length scales, with the\nstrengthening exponent of -0.68 at room temperature and of -1.00 at\n90$^\\circ$C. We also report the elastic and shear moduli as a function of\ncrystallographic orientation gleaned from experiments and first principles\ncalculations, which show a high level of anisotropy up to the melting point,\nwhere the elastic and shear moduli vary by a factor of ~4 between the stiffest\nand most compliant orientations. The emergence of such high strengths in\nsmall-scale Li and sensitivity of this metal's stiffness to crystallographic\norientation help explain why the existing methods of dendrite suppression have\nbeen mainly unsuccessful and have significant implications for practical design\nof future-generation batteries.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the stellar populations of model galaxies as\na function of galaxy evolutionary history and angular momentum content. We use\nthe new semi-analytic model presented in Tonini et al. (2016). This new model\nfollows the angular momentum evolution of gas and stars, providing the base for\na new star formation recipe, and treatment of the effects of mergers that\ndepends on the central galaxy dynamical structure. We find that the new recipes\nhave the effect of boosting the efficiency of the baryonic cycle in producing\nand recycling metals, as well as preventing minor mergers from diluting the\nmetallicity of bulges and ellipticals. The model reproduces the stellar mass -\nstellar metallicity relation for galaxies above 1e10 solar masses, including\nBrightest Cluster Galaxies. Model disks, galaxies dominated by\ninstability-driven components, and merger-driven objects each stem from\ndifferent evolutionary channels. These model galaxies therefore occupy\ndifferent loci in the galaxy mass-size relation, which we find to be in accord\nwith the Atlas 3D classification of disk galaxies, fast rotators and slow\nrotators. We find that the stellar populations' properties depend on the galaxy\nevolutionary type, with more evolved stellar populations being part of systems\nthat have lost or dissipated more angular momentum during their assembly\nhistory.\n", "  The Dicke model and the superradiance of two-level systems in a radiation\nfield have many applications. Recently, a Dicke quantum phase transition has\nbeen realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate in a cavity. We numerically solve\nthe many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation and study correlations in the ground state\nof interacting bosons in a cavity as a function of the strength of a driving\nlaser. Beyond a critical strength, the bosons occupy multiple modes\nmacroscopically while remaining superradiant. This fragmented superradiance can\nbe detected by analyzing the variance of single-shot measurements.\n", "  Metallic nanostructures provide a toolkit for the generation of coherent\nlight below the diffraction limit. Plasmonic based lasing relies on the\npopulation inversion of emitters (such as organic fluorophores) along with\nfeedback provided by plasmonic resonances. In this regime, known as weak light\nmatter coupling, the radiative characteristics of the system can be described\nby the Purcell effect. Strong light matter coupling between the molecular\nexcitons and electromagnetic field generated by the plasmonic structures leads\nto the formation of hybrid quasi-particles known as plasmon exciton polaritons\n(PEPs). Due to the bosonic character of these quasi particles, exciton\npolariton condensation can lead to laser-like emission at much lower threshold\npowers than in conventional photon lasers. Here, we observe PEP lasing through\na dark plasmonic mode in an array of metallic nanoparticles with a low\nthreshold in an optically pumped organic system. Interestingly, the threshold\npower of the lasing is reduced by increasing the degree of light matter\ncoupling in spite of the degradation of the quantum efficiency of the active\nmaterial, highlighting the ultrafast dynamic responsible for the lasing, i.e.,\nstimulated scattering. These results demonstrate a unique roomtemperature\nplatform for exploring the physics of exciton polaritons in an open cavity\narchitecture and pave the road toward the integration of this on-chip lasing\ndevice with the current photonics and active metamaterial planar technologies.\n", "  We study the shadow of a charged rotating black hole in $f(R)$ gravity. This\nblack hole is characterized by mass, $M$, spin, $a$, electric charge, $Q$ and\n$R_{0}$ which is proportional to cosmological constant. We analyze the image of\nthe black hole's shadow in four types 1) at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$, 2) at\n$r\\rightarrow r_{o}$, in vacuum, 3) at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$, 4) at\n$r\\rightarrow r_{o}$, for an observer at the presence of plasma. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the effect of spin, charge and modfication of gravity on the shape\nof shadow. In addition, we use two observables, the radius $R_{s}$ and the\ndistortion parameter $\\delta_{s}$, characterizing the apparent shape. We show\nthat for all cases, the shadow becomes smaller with increasing electric charge.\nAlso, by increasing the rotation parameters, circular symmetry of the image of\nblack hole's shadow will change. Furthermore, in the presence of plasma, plasma\nparameter also effects on size of the shadow.\n", "  The {\\it Kepler} mission has detected thousands of planetary systems with 1-7\ntransiting planets packed within 0.7~au from their host stars. There is an\napparent excess of single-transit planet systems that cannot be explained by\ntransit geometries alone, when a single planetary mutual inclination dispersion\nis assumed. This suggests that the observed compact planetary systems have at\nleast two different architectures. We present a scenario where the \"Kepler\ndichotomy\" may be explained by the action of an external giant planet or\nstellar companion misaligned with the inner multi-planet system. The external\ncompanion excites mutual inclinations of the inner planets, causing such\nsystems to appear as \"Kepler singles\" in transit surveys. We derive approximate\nanalytic expressions (in various limiting regimes), calibrated with numerical\ncalculations, for the mutual inclination excitations for various planetary\nsystems and perturber properties (mass $m_p$, semi-major axis $a_p$ and\ninclination $\\theta_p$). In general, the excited mutual inclination increases\nwith $m_p/a_p^3$ and $\\theta_p$, although secular resonances may lead to large\nmutual inclinations even for small $\\theta_p$. We discuss the implications of\nour results for understanding the dynamical history of transiting planet\nsystems with known external perturbers.\n", "  Coronal-hole jets occur ubiquitously in solar coronal holes, at EUV and X-ray\nbright points associated with intrusions of minority magnetic polarity. The\nembedded-bipole model for these jets posits that they are driven by explosive,\nfast reconnection between the stressed closed field of the embedded bipole and\nthe open field of the surrounding coronal hole. Previous numerical studies in\nCartesian geometry, assuming uniform ambient magnetic field and plasma while\nneglecting gravity and solar wind, demonstrated that the model is robust and\ncan produce jet-like events in simple configurations. We have extended these\ninvestigations by including spherical geometry, gravity, and solar wind in a\nnonuniform, coronal hole-like ambient atmosphere. Our simulations confirm that\nthe jet is initiated by the onset of a kink-like instability of the internal\nclosed field, which induces a burst of reconnection between the closed and\nexternal open field, launching a helical jet. Our new results demonstrate that\nthe jet propagation is sustained through the outer corona, in the form of a\ntraveling nonlinear Alfven wave front trailed by slower-moving plasma density\nenhancements that are compressed and accelerated by the wave. This finding\nagrees well with observations of white-light coronal-hole jets, and can explain\nmicrostreams and torsional Alfven waves detected in situ in the solar wind. We\nalso use our numerical results to deduce scaling relationships between\nproperties of the coronal source region and the characteristics of the\nresulting jet, which can be tested against observations.\n", "  A space-based interferometer such as eLISA could observe few to few thousands\nprogenitors of black hole binaries (BHBs) similar to those recently detected by\nAdvanced LIGO. Gravitational radiation circularizes the orbit during inspiral,\nbut some BHBs retain a measurable eccentricity at the low frequencies where\neLISA is most sensitive. The eccentricity of a BHB carries precious information\nabout its formation channel: BHBs formed in the field, in globular clusters, or\nclose to a massive black hole (MBH) have distinct eccentricity distributions in\nthe eLISA band. We generate mock eLISA observations, folding in measurement\nerrors, and using Bayesian model selection we study whether eLISA measurements\ncan identify the BHB formation channel. We find that a handful of observations\nwould suffice to tell whether BHBs were formed in the gravitational field of a\nMBH. Conversely, several tens of observations are needed to tell apart field\nformation from globular cluster formation. A five-year eLISA mission with the\nlongest possible armlength is desirable to shed light on BHB formation\nscenarios.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the numeric calculation of antiferromagnetic\nresonance frequencies for the non-collinear antiferromagnets of general type.\nThis algorithm uses general exchange symmetry approach \\cite{andrmar} and is\napplicable for description of low-energy dynamics of an arbitrary noncollinear\nspin structure in weak fields. Algorithm is implemented as a MatLab and C++\nprogram codes, which are available for download. Program codes are tested\nagainst some representative analytically solvable cases.\n", "  Through transport, compositional and structural studies, we review the\nfeatures of the charge-density wave (CDW) conductor of NbS$_{3}$ (phase II). We\nhighlight three central results: 1) In addition to the previously reported CDW\ntransitions at $T_{P1}$ = 360\\,K and $T_{P2}$ = 150\\,K, another CDW transition\noccurs at a much higher temperature $T_{P0}$ = 620-650\\,K; evidence for the\nnon-linear conductivity of this CDW is presented. 2) We show that CDW\nassociated with the $T_{P2}$ - transition arises from S vacancies acting as\ndonors. Such a CDW transition has not been observed before. 3) We show\nexceptional coherence of the $T_{P1}$-CDW at room-temperature. Additionally, we\nreport on the effects of uniaxial strain on the CDW transition temperatures and\ntransport.\n", "  The Gamma-ray BL Lac object OJ 287 is known to exhibit inner-parsec\n\"jet-wobbling\", high degrees of variability at all wavelengths and\nquasi-stationary features including an apparent (~100 deg) position angle\nchange in projection on the sky plane. Sub-50 micro-arcsecond resolution 86 GHz\nobservations with the global mm-VLBI array (GMVA) supplement ongoing\nmulti-frequency VLBI blazar monitoring at lower frequencies. Using these maps\ntogether with cm/mm total intensity and Gamma-ray observations from Fermi/LAT\nfrom 2008-2014, we aimed to determine the location of Gamma-ray emission and to\nexplain the inner-mas structural changes. Observations with the GMVA offer\napproximately double the angular resolution compared with 43 GHz VLBA\nobservations and allow us to observe above the synchrotron self-absorption peak\nfrequency. The jet was spectrally decomposed at multiple locations along the\njet. From this we derived estimates of the magnetic field. How the field\ndecreases down the jet allowed an estimate of the distance to the jet apex and\nan estimate of the magnetic field strength at the jet apex and in the broad\nline region. Combined with accurate kinematics we attempt to locate the site of\nGamma-ray activity, radio flares and spectral changes. Strong Gamma-ray flares\nappeared to originate from either the \"core\" region, a downstream stationary\nfeature, or both, with Gamma-ray activity significantly correlated with radio\nflaring in the downstream quasi-stationary feature. Magnetic field estimates\nwere determined at multiple locations along the jet, with the magnetic field\nfound to be >1.6 G in the \"core\" and >0.4 G in the downstream quasi-stationary\nfeature. We therefore found upper limits on the location of the \"core\" as >6.0\npc from the jet apex and determined an upper limit on the magnetic field near\nthe jet base of the order of thousands of Gauss.\n", "  We present the discovery and preliminary characterization of a\ngravitationally lensed quasar with a source redshift $z_{s}=2.74$ and image\nseparation of $2.9\"$ lensed by a foreground $z_{l}=0.40$ elliptical galaxy.\nSince the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are the superposition of\nmultiple point sources and a foreground lensing galaxy, we have developed a\nmorphology independent multi-wavelength approach to the photometric selection\nof lensed quasar candidates based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) supervised\nmachine learning. Using this technique and $gi$ multicolour photometric\nobservations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), near IR $JK$ photometry from\nthe VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and WISE mid IR photometry, we have\nidentified a candidate system with two catalogue components with $i_{AB}=18.61$\nand $i_{AB}=20.44$ comprised of an elliptical galaxy and two blue point\nsources. Spectroscopic follow-up with NTT and the use of an archival AAT\nspectrum show that the point sources can be identified as a lensed quasar with\nan emission line redshift of $z=2.739\\pm0.003$ and a foreground early type\ngalaxy with $z=0.400\\pm0.002$. We model the system as a single isothermal\nellipsoid and find the Einstein radius $\\theta_E \\sim 1.47\"$, enclosed mass\n$M_{enc} \\sim 4 \\times 10^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$ and a time delay of $\\sim$52 days.\nThe relatively wide separation, month scale time delay duration and high\nredshift make this an ideal system for constraining the expansion rate beyond a\nredshift of 1.\n", "  The quantum decay of a relativistic scalar field from a metastable state\n(\"false vacuum decay\") is a fundamental idea in quantum field theory and\ncosmology. This occurs via local formation of bubbles of true vacuum with their\nsubsequent rapid expansion. It can be considered as a relativistic analog of a\nfirst-order phase transition in condensed matter. Here we expand upon our\nrecent proposal [EPL 110, 56001 (2015)] for an experimental test of false\nvacuum decay using an ultra-cold spinor Bose gas. A false vacuum for the\nrelative phase of two spin components, serving as the unstable scalar field, is\ngenerated by means of a modulated linear coupling of the spin components. We\nanalyze the system theoretically using the functional integral approach and\nshow that various microscopic degrees of freedom in the system, albeit leading\nto dissipation in the relative phase sector, will not hamper the observation of\nthe false vacuum decay in the laboratory. This is well supported by numerical\nsimulations demonstrating the spontaneous formation of true vacuum bubbles on\nmillisecond time-scales in two-component $^{7}$Li or $^{41}$K bosonic\ncondensates in one-dimensional traps of $\\sim100\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ size.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the induced inflation with two flat regions: one\nStarobinsky-like plateau in big field regime and one shorter plateau around the\nsaddle point of the Einstein frame potential. This multi-phase inflationary\nscenario can be used to solve the problem of classical cosmology. The inflation\nat the saddle-point plateau is consistent with the data and can have\narbitrarily low scale. The results can be useful in the context of the\nHiggs-Axion relaxation and in a certain limit they are equivalent to the\n$\\alpha$-attractors.\n", "  A self-consistent Bogoliubov deGennes theory of the vortex lattice state in a\n2D strong type-II superconductor at high magnetic fields reveals a novel\nquantum mixed state around the semiclassical Hc2, characterized by a\nwell-defined Landau--Bloch band structure in the quasi-particle spectrum and\nsuppressed order-parameter amplitude, which sharply crossover into the\nwell-known semiclassical (Helfand-Werthamer) results upon decreasing magnetic\nfield. Application to the 2D superconducting state observed recently on the\nsurface of the topological insulator Sb2Te3, accounts well for the experimental\ndata, revealing a strong type-II superconductor, with unusually low carrier\ndensity and very small cyclotron mass, which can be realized only in the strong\ncoupling superconductor limit.\n", "  We investigate the potential for controlling a non-interacting Bose-Einstein\ncondensate loaded into a one-dimensional optical superlattice. Our control\nstrategy combines Bloch oscillations originating from accelerating the lattice\nand from time-dependent control of the superlattice parameters. We investigate\ntwo experimentally viable scenarios, very low and very high potential depths.\nWe are able to exhibit a wide range of control over energy band populations\nusing the superlattice control parameters. With this analysis we consider\nseveral examples of quantum state preparation in the superlattice structure\nthat may be difficult to achieve in a regular lattice.\n", "  We report on the discovery of extended Ly-alpha nebulae at z~3.3 in the\nHubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF, ~ 40 kpc X 80 kpc) and behind the Hubble\nFrontier Fields galaxy cluster MACSJ0416 (~ 40kpc), spatially associated with\ngroups of star-forming galaxies. VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopy reveals a\ncomplex structure with a spatially-varying double peaked Ly-alpha emission.\nOverall, the spectral profiles of the two Ly-alpha nebulae are remarkably\nsimilar, both showing a prominent blue emission, more intense and slightly\nbroader than the red peak. From the first nebula, located in the HUDF, no X-ray\nemission has been detected, disfavoring the possible presence of AGNs.\nSpectroscopic redshifts have been derived for 11 galaxies within two arcsec\nfrom the nebula and spanning the redshift range 1.037<z<5.97. The second\nnebula, behind MACSJ0416, shows three aligned star-forming galaxies plausibly\nassociated to the emitting gas. In both systems, the associated galaxies reveal\npossible intense rest-frame-optical nebular emissions lines\n[OIII]4959-5007+Hbeta with equivalent widths as high as 1500A rest-frame and\nstar formation rates ranging from a few to tens of solar masses per year. A\npossible scenario is that of a group of young, star-forming galaxies sources of\nescaping ionising radiation that induce Ly-alpha fluorescence, therefore\nrevealing the kinematics of the surrounding gas. Also Ly-alpha powered by\nstar-formation and/or cooling radiation may resemble the double peaked spectral\nproperties and the morphology observed here. If the intense blue emission is\nassociated with inflowing gas, then we may be witnessing an early phase of\ngalaxy or a proto-cluster (or group) formation.\n", "  Many exoplanetary systems containing hot Jupiters (HJs) exhibit significant\nmisalignment between the spin axes of the host stars and the orbital angular\nmomentum axes of the planets (\"spin-orbit misalignment\"). High-eccentricity\nmigration involving Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's orbit induced by a\ndistant perturber is a possible channel for producing such misaligned HJ\nsystems. Previous works have shown that the dynamical evolution of the stellar\nspin axis during the high-$e$ migration plays a dominant role in generating the\nobserved spin-orbit misalignment. Numerical studies have also revealed various\npatterns of the evolution of the stellar spin axis leading to the final\nmisalignment. Here we develop an analytic theory to elucidate the evolution of\nspin-orbit misalignment during the Lidov-Kozai migration of planets in stellar\nbinaries. Secular spin-orbit resonances play a key role in the misalignment\nevolution. We include the effects of short-range forces and tidal dissipation,\nand categorize the different possible paths to spin-orbit misalignment as a\nfunction of various physical parameters (e.g. planet mass and stellar rotation\nperiod). We identify five distinct spin-orbit evolution paths and outcomes,\nonly two of which are capable of producing retrograde orbits. We show that\nthese paths to misalignment and the outcomes depend only on two dimensionless\nparameters, which compare the stellar spin precession frequency with the rate\nof change of the planet's orbital axis, and the Lidov-Kozai oscillation\nfrequency. Our analysis reveals a number of novel phenomena for the stellar\nspin evolution, ranging from bifurcation, adiabatic advection, to fully chaotic\nevolution of spin-orbit angles.\n", "  The inversion layer of p-InSb(110) obtained by Cs adsorption of 1.8 % of a\nmonolayer is used to probe the Landau level wave functions within smooth\npotential valleys by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy at 14 T. The nodal\nstructure becomes apparent as a double peak structure of each spin polarized\nfirst Landau level, while the zeroth Landau level exhibits a single peak per\nspin level only. The real space data show single rings of the valley-confined\ndrift states for the zeroth Landau level and double rings for the first Landau\nlevel. The result is reproduced by a recursive Green's function algorithm using\nthe potential landscape obtained experimentally. We show that the result is\ngeneric by comparing the local density of states from the Green's function\nalgorithm with results from a well controlled analytic model based on the\nguiding center approach.\n", "  Pressure-induced ordering close to a $z=1$ quantum critical point is studied\nin the presence of bond disorder in the quantum spin system\n(C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2$)Cu$_2$(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_{x}$)$_6$ (PHCX) by means of muon-spin\nrotation and relaxation. As for the pure system\n(C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2$)Cu$_2$Cl$_6$, pressure allows PHCX with small levels of\ndisorder ($x\\leq 7.5\\%$) to be driven through a quantum critical point\nseparating a low-pressure quantum paramagnetic phase from magnetic order at\nhigh pressures. However, the pressure-induced ordered state is highly\ninhomogeneous for disorder concentrations $x>1\\%$. This behavior might be\nrelated to the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase above a critical disorder\nconcentration $7.5\\%<x_{\\rm c}<15\\%$. Br-substitution increases the critical\npressure and suppresses critical temperatures and ordered moment sizes.\n", "  In Ref. [1], the properties of the first gravitational wave detected by LIGO,\nGW150914, were measured by employing an effective-one-body (EOB) model of\nprecessing binary black holes whose underlying dynamics and waveforms were\ncalibrated to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. Here, we perform the first\nextensive comparison of such EOBNR model to 70 precessing NR waveforms that\nspan mass ratios from 1 to 5, dimensionless spin magnitudes up to 0.5, generic\nspin orientations, and length of about 20 orbits. We work in the observer's\ninertial frame and include all $\\ell=2$ modes in the gravitational-wave\npolarizations. We introduce new prescriptions for the EOB ringdown signal\nconcerning its spectrum and time of onset. For total masses between 10Msun and\n200Msun, we find that precessing EOBNR waveforms have unfaithfulness within\nabout 3% to NR waveforms when considering the Advanced-LIGO design noise curve.\nThis result is obtained without recalibration of the inspiral-plunge of the\nunderlying nonprecessing EOBNR model. The unfaithfulness is computed with\nmaximization over time and phase of arrival, sky location and polarization of\nthe EOBNR waveform and it is averaged over sky location and polarization of the\nNR signal. We also present comparisons between NR and EOBNR waveforms in a\nframe that tracks the orbital precession.\n", "  The theory of majorization and its variants, including thermomajorization,\nhave been found to play a central role in the formulation of many physical\nresource theories, ranging from entanglement theory to quantum thermodynamics.\nHere we formulate the framework of quantum relative Lorenz curves, and show how\nit is able to unify majorization, thermomajorization, and their noncommutative\nanalogues. In doing so, we define the family of Hilbert $\\alpha$-divergences\nand show how it relates with other divergences used in quantum information\ntheory. We then apply these tools to the problem of deciding the existence of a\nsuitable transformation from an initial pair of quantum states to a final one,\nfocusing in particular on applications to the resource theory of athermality, a\nprecursor of quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  Surface distributions of two level system (TLS) defects and magnetic vortices\nare limiting dissipation sources in superconducting quantum circuits. Arrays of\nflux-trapping holes are commonly used to eliminate loss due to magnetic\nvortices, but may increase dielectric TLS loss. We find that dielectric TLS\nloss increases by approximately 25% for resonators with a hole array beginning\n2 $\\mu \\text{m}$ from the resonator edge, while the dielectric loss added by\nholes further away was below measurement sensitivity. Other forms of loss were\nnot affected by the holes. Additionally, we estimate the loss due to residual\nmagnetic effects to be $9\\times 10^{-10} /\\mu\\text{T} $ for resonators\npatterned with flux-traps and operated in magnetic fields up to $5$\n$\\mu\\text{T}$. This is orders of magnitude below the total loss of the best\nsuperconducting coplanar waveguide resonators.\n", "  We study a toy version of a grand-unified theory on the lattice: An $SU(3)$\ngauge theory, which experiences a Brout-Englert-Higgs effect due to a single\nHiggs field in the fundamental representation. This yields a perturbative\nbreaking pattern $SU(3) \\rightarrow SU(2)$. We investigate the singlet vector\nchannel, finding an apparently non-degenerate and massive ground state. This is\nin contradistinction to the perturbative prediction of three massless and five\nmassive vector states, even though the correlation functions of the gauge\nbosons exhibit a weak-coupling behavior, being almost tree-level-like. However,\na combination of perturbation theory with the Fr\\\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi\nmechanism allows to predict the physical spectrum in this channel.\n", "  For many years researchers have tried to glean hints about quantum gravity\nfrom black hole thermodynamics. However, black hole thermodynamics suffers from\nthe problem of Universality --- at leading order, several approaches with\ndifferent microscopic degrees of freedom lead to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We\nattempt to bypass this issue by using a minimal statistical mechanical model\nfor the horizon fluid based on Damour-Navier-Stokes (DNS) equation. For\nstationary asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in General Relativity, we\nshow explicitly that at equilibrium the entropy of the horizon fluid is the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy. Further we show that, for the bulk viscosity of the\nfluctuations of the horizon fluid to be identical to Damour, a confinement\nscale exists for these fluctuations, implying quantization of the horizon area.\nThe implications and possible mechanisms from the fluid point of view are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a new analytical approach to derive approximate solutions\ndescribing the shock evolution in non-radiative supernova remnants (SNRs). We\nfocus on the study of the forward shock and contact discontinuity while\napplication to the reverse shock is only discussed briefly. The spherical shock\nevolution of a SNR in both the interstellar medium with a constant density\nprofile and a circumstellar medium with a wind density profile is investigated.\nWe compared our new analytical solution with numerical simulations and found\nthat a few percent accuracy is achieved. For the evolution of the forward\nshock, we also compared our new solution to previous analytical models. In a\nuniform ambient medium, the accuracy of our analytical approximation is\ncomparable to that in Truelove&McKee (1999). In a wind density profile medium,\nour solution performs better than that in Micelotta et al. (2016), especially\nwhen the ejecta envelope has a steep density profile. The new solution is\nsignificantly simplified compared to previous analytical models, as it only\ndepends on the asymptotic behaviors of the remnant during its evolution.\n", "  Upper bounds are derived on the amount of magnetic energy that can be\ngenerated by dynamo action in collisional and collisionless plasmas with and\nwithout external forcing. A hierarchy of mathematical descriptions is\nconsidered for the plasma dynamics: ideal MHD, visco-resistive MHD, the\ndouble-adiabatic theory of Chew, Goldberger and Low (CGL), kinetic MHD, and\nother kinetic models. It is found that dynamo action is greatly constrained in\nmodels where the magnetic moment of any particle species is conserved. In the\nabsence of external forcing, the magnetic energy then remains small at all\ntimes if it is small in the initial state. In other words, a small \"seed\"\nmagnetic field cannot be amplified significantly, regardless of the nature of\nflow, as long as the collision frequency and gyroradius are small enough to be\nnegligible. A similar conclusion also holds if the system is subject to\nexternal forcing as long as this forcing conserves the magnetic moment of at\nleast one plasma species and does not greatly increase the total energy of the\nplasma (i.e., in practice, is subsonic). Dynamo action therefore always\nrequires collisions or some small-scale kinetic mechanism for breaking the\nadiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment.\n", "  We present a study of top quark polarization in $t \\overline{t}$ events\nproduced in $p \\overline{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. Data correspond\nto 9.7 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the D0 detector at the Tevatron. We use final\nstates containing a lepton and at least three jets. The polarization is\nmeasured using the distribution of leptons along the beam and helicity axes,\nand the axis normal to the production plane. This is the first measurement of\ntop quark polarization at the Tevatron in $\\ell$+jets final states, and first\nmeasurement of transverse polarization in $t \\overline{t}$ production. The\nobserved distributions are consistent with the standard model.\n", "  We use a sample built on the SDSS DR7 catalogue and the bulge-disc\ndecomposition of Simard et al. (2011) to study how the bulge and disc\ncomponents contribute to the parent galaxy's star formation activity, by\ndetermining its position in the star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass\n(M$_{\\star}$) plane at 0.02$<z<$0.1. We use the bulge and disc colours as proxy\nfor their SFRs. We study the mean galaxy bulge-total mass ratio (B/T) as a\nfunction of the residual from the MS ($\\Delta_{MS}$) and find that the\nB/T-$\\Delta_{MS}$ relation exhibits a parabola-like shape with the peak of the\nMS corresponding to the lowest B/Ts at any stellar mass. The lower and upper\nenvelop of the MS are populated by galaxies with similar B/T, velocity\ndispersion and concentration ($R_{90}/R_{50}$) values. Bulges above the MS are\ncharacterised by blue colours or, when red, by a high level of dust\nobscuration, thus indicating that in both cases they are actively star forming.\nWhen on the MS or below it, bulges are mostly red and dead. At stellar masses\nabove $10^{10.5} $M$_{\\odot}$, bulges on the MS or in the green valley tend to\nbe significantly redder than their counterparts in the quiescence region,\ndespite similar levels of dust obscuration. The disc color anti-correlates at\nany mass with the distance from the MS, getting redder when approaching the MS\nlower envelope and the quiescence region. We conclude that the position of a\ngalaxy in the LogSFR-LogM$_{\\star}$ plane depends on the star formation\nactivity of its components: above the MS both bulge and disk are actively star\nforming. The nuclear activity is the first to be suppressed, moving the\ngalaxies on the MS. Once the disk stops forming stars as well, the galaxy moves\nbelow the MS and eventually to the quiescence region. This is confirmed by a\nlarge fraction ($\\sim45\\%$) of passive galaxies with a secure two component\nmorphology.\n", "  Superconducting films in contact with non-superconducting regular arrays can\nexhibit commensurability effects between the vortex lattice and the unit cell\nof the pinning array. These matching effects yield a slowdown of the vortex\nflow and the corresponding dissipation decrease. The superconducting samples\nare Nb films grown on Si substrates. We have studied these matching effects\nwith the array on top, embedded or threading the Nb superconducting films and\nusing different materials (Si, Cu, Ni, Py dots and dots fabricated with Co/Pd\nmultilayers). These hybrids allow studying the contribution of different\npinning potentials to the matching effects. The main findings are: i) Periodic\nroughness induced in the superconducting film is enough to generate resistivity\nminima; ii) A minor effect is achieved by magnetic pinning from periodic\nmagnetic field potentials obtained by dots with out of plane magnetization\ngrown on top of the superconducting film, iii) In the case of array of magnetic\ndots embedded in the films vortex flow probes the magnetic state; i.e.\nmagnetoresistance measurements detect the magnetic state of very small\nnanomagnets. In addition, we have studied the role played by the local order in\nthe commensurability effects. This was attained using an array that mimics a\nsmectic crystal. We have found that preserving the local order is crucial. If\nthe local order is not retained the magnetoresistance minima vanish.\n", "  I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF)\nmethod, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the\nstellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the\nproblem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ is\nsmaller than the velocity sampling $\\Delta V$, which is generally, by design,\nclose to the instrumental dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm inst}$. The standard approach\nconsists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for\nits parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\\sigma<\\Delta V/2$, due\nto undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I\npresent a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of\nthe under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled\nanalytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple\nanalytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular\nGauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for\nthe line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was\nimplemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software.\nThe key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities\nregardless of $\\sigma$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys\ntargeting galaxies with $\\sigma\\ll\\sigma_{\\rm inst}$, for galaxy redshift\ndeterminations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars.\nThe proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms\nused in today's popular software packages.\n", "  Motivated by the discovery of the non-thermal Fermi bubble features both\nbelow and above the Galactic plane, we investigate a scenario in which these\nbubbles are formed through Galacto-centric outflow. Cosmic rays (CR) both\ndiffusing and advecting within a Galactic breeze outflow, interacting with the\nambient gas present, give rise to gamma-ray emission, providing an\napproximately flat surface brightness profile of this emission, as observed.\nApplying the same outflow profile further out within the disk, the resultant\neffects on the observable CR spectral properties are determined. A hardening in\nthe spectra due to the competition of advective and diffusive propagation\nwithin a particular energy range is noted, even in the limiting case of equal\nCR diffusion coefficients in the disk and halo. It is postulated that this\nhardening effect may relate to the observed hardening feature in the CR\nspectrum at a rigidity of $\\approx 200$ GV.\n", "  The realization of synthetic gauge fields has attracted a lot of attention\nrecently in relation with periodically driven systems and the Floquet theory.\nIn ultra-cold atom systems in optical lattices and photonic networks, this\nallows to simulate exotic phases of matter such as quantum Hall phases,\nanomalous quantum Hall phases and analogs of topological insulators. In this\npaper, we apply the Floquet theory to engineer anisotropic Haldane models on\nthe honeycomb lattice and two-leg ladder systems. We show that these\nanisotropic Haldane models still possess a topologically non-trivial band\nstructure associated with chiral edge modes (without the presence of a net unit\nflux in a unit cell), then referring to the quantum anomalous Hall effect.\nFocusing on (interacting) boson systems in s-wave bands of the lattice, we show\nhow to engineer through the Floquet theory, a quantum phase transition between\na uniform superfluid and a BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensate) analog of FFLO\n(Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov) states, where bosons condense at non-zero\nwave-vectors. We perform a Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the quantum phase\ntransition on the graphene lattice, and compute observables such as chiral\ncurrents and the momentum distribution. The results are supported by exact\ndiagonalization calculations and compared with those of the isotropic\nsituation. The validity of high-frequency expansion in the Floquet theory is\nalso tested using time-dependent simulations for various parameters of the\nmodel. Last, we show that the anisotropic choice for the effective vector\npotential allows a bosonization approach in equivalent ladder (strip)\ngeometries.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of an XYZ Heisenberg chain with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which describes the low-energy behaviors of\na one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled bosonic model in the deep insulating\nregion. The entropy and the specific heat are calculated numerically by the\nquasi-exact transfer-matrix renormalization group. In particular, in the limit\n$U^\\prime/U\\rightarrow\\infty$, our model is exactly solvable and thus serves as\na benchmark for our numerical method. From our data, we find that for\n$U^\\prime/U>1$ a quantum phase transition between an (anti)ferromagnetic phase\nand a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase occurs at a finite $\\theta$, while for\n$U^\\prime/U<1$ a transition between a ferromagnetic phase and a paramagnetic\nphase happens at $\\theta=0$. A refined ground-state phase diagram is then\ndeduced from their low-temperature behaviors. Our findings provide an\nalternative way to detect those distinguishable phases experimentally.\n", "  We demonstrate all-optical implementation of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a\ntwo-electron Fermi gas of $^{173}$Yb atoms by coupling two hyperfine ground\nstates with a narrow optical transition. Due to the SU($N$) symmetry of the\n$^1$S$_0$ ground-state manifold which is insensitive to external magnetic\nfields, an optical AC Stark effect is applied to split the ground spin states,\nwhich exhibits a high stability compared with experiments on alkali and\nlanthanide atoms, and separate out an effective spin-1/2 subspace from other\nhyperfine levels for the realization of SOC. The dephasing spin dynamics when a\nmomentum-dependent spin-orbit gap being suddenly opened and the asymmetric\nmomentum distribution of the spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas are observed as a\nhallmark of SOC. The realization of all-optical SOC for ytterbium fermions\nshould offer a new route to a long-lived spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas and\ngreatly expand our capability in studying novel spin-orbit physics with\nalkaline-earth-like atoms.\n", "  We address the general features of event-by-event fluctuations of the\nmultiplicity of gluons produced in the scattering of a dilute hadron off a\nlarge nucleus at high energy in the fragmentation region of the dilute hadron.\nWe relate these fluctuations to the stochasticity of the number of quanta\ncontained in the hadron at the time of the interaction. For simplicity, we\naddress the ideal case in which the hadron is an onium, and investigate\ndifferent kinematical regimes in rapidity and onium size. We show that at large\nrapidity, the multiplicity distribution exhibits an exponential tail in the\nlarge-multiplicity region, which is qualitatively consistent with the\nproton-nucleus data. But interestingly enough, the exponential shape is\ndetermined by confinement.\n", "  The PAMELA space experiment, in orbit since 2006, has measured cosmic rays\nthrough the most recent A < 0 solar minimum activity period. During this entire\ntime, galactic electrons and protons have been detected down to 70 MV and 400\nMV, respectively, and their differential intensity variation in time has been\nmonitored with unprecedented accuracy. These observations are used to show how\ndifferently electrons and protons responded to the quiet modulation conditions\nthat prevailed from 2006 to 2009. It is well known that particle drifts, as one\nof four major mechanisms for the solar modulation of cosmic rays, cause\ncharge-sign dependent solar modulation. Solar minimum activity periods provide\noptimal conditions to study these drift effects. The observed behaviour is\ncompared to the solutions of a three-dimensional model for cosmic rays in the\nheliosphere, including drifts. The numerical results confirm that the\ndifference in the evolution of electron and proton spectra during the last\nprolonged solar minimum is attributed to a large extent to particle drifts. We\ntherefore present new evidence of charge-sign dependent solar modulation, with\nperspective on its peculiarities for the observed period from 2006 to 2009.\n", "  In this paper some of the brightest GeV sources observed by the Fermi-LAT\nwere analysed, focusing on their spectral cut-off region. The sources chosen\nfor this investigation were the brightest blazar flares of 3C~454.3 and 3C~279\nand the Vela pulsar with a reanalysis with the latest Fermi-LAT software. For\nthe study of the spectral cut-off we first explored the Vela pulsar spectrum,\nwhose statistics in the time interval of the 3FGL catalog allowed strong\nconstraints to be obtained on the parameters. We subsequently performed a new\nanalysis of the flaring blazar SEDs. For these sources we obtained constraints\non the cut-off parameters under the assumption that their underlying spectral\ndistribution is described by a power-law with a stretched exponential cut-off.\nWe then highlighted the significant potential improvements on such constraints\nby observations with next generation ground based Cherenkov telescopes,\nrepresented in our study by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Adopting\ncurrently available simulations for this future observatory, we demonstrate the\nconsiderable improvement in cut-off constraints achievable by observations with\nthis new instrument when compared with that achievable by satellite\nobservations.\n", "  Two eclipsing binaries in the USco association have recently yielded precise\nvalues of masses and radii for 4 low-mass members of the association. Standard\nevolution models would require these dM4.5 - dM5 stars to have ages which are\nyounger than the ages of more massive stars in the association by factors which\nappear (in extreme cases) to be as large as ~3. Are the stars in the\nassociation therefore non-coeval? We suggest that the answer is No: by\nincorporating the effects of magnetic inhibition of convective onset, we show\nthat the stars in USco can be restored to coevality provided that the 4\nlow-mass member stars have vertical surface fields in the range 200 - 700 G.\nFields of such magnitude have already been measured on the surface of certain\nsolar-type stars in other young clusters.\n", "  We demonstrate that ideal anapole metamaterials have infinite Q-factor. We\nhave designed and fabricated a metamaterial consisting of planar metamolecules\nwhich exhibit anapole behavior in the sense that the electric dipole radiation\nis almost cancelled by the toroidal dipole one, producing thus an extremely\nhigh Q-factor at the resonance frequency. The size of the system, at the mm\nrange, and the parasitic magnetic quadrupole radiation are the factors limiting\nthe size of the Q-factor. In spite of the very low radiation losses the local\nfields at the metamolecules are extremely high, of the order of higher than the\nexternal incoming field.\n", "  We present a new implementation of star formation in cosmological\nsimulations, by considering star clusters as a unit of star formation. Cluster\nparticles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by\nlocal gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is\nterminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium.\nWe test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift, by\ncomparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star\nclusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a\nSchechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with\nobservations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is $\\alpha\\approx 1.8-2$,\nwhile the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate. A related\ntrend is a positive correlation between the surface density of star formation\nrate and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate\nthat the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star\nformation. These bursts are often associated with major merger events. We also\nfind that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr\nand decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local\nvariations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the\nscatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when\nthe instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation\ntimescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an\nadditional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback\nschemes.\n", "  We investigate the cluster size convergence of the energy and observables\nusing two forms of density matrix embedding theory (DMET): the original cluster\nform (CDMET) and a new formulation motivated by the dynamical cluster\napproximation (DCA-DMET). Both methods are applied to the half-filled one- and\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard models using a sign-problem free auxiliary-field\nquantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) impurity solver, which allows for the treatment of\nlarge impurity clusters of up to 100 sites. While CDMET is more accurate at\nsmaller impurity cluster sizes, DCA- DMET exhibits faster asymptotic\nconvergence towards the thermodynamic limit (TDL). We use our two formulations\nto produce new accurate estimates for the energy and local moment of the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model for U/t = 2, 4, 6. These results compare\nfavourably with the best data available in literature, and help resolve earlier\nuncertainties in the moment for U/t = 2.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the mechanism of two-mode quadrature squeezing\nin regime of four-wave mixing in a \\Lambda-scheme of three-level atoms embedded\nin a thermal reservoir. We demonstrate that the process of nonlinear transfer\nof noise from the low frequency of ground state splitting to the optical\nfrequency drastically modifies the condition of effective two-mode squeezing.\nThe damage factor is significant if number of thermal photons at the low\nfrequency is high and the role of inelastic processes in ground state coherence\ndecay is not negligible. We found the optimal conditions for squeezing, in\nparticular optimal density-length product of active medium depending on the\nrelaxation parameters and drive intensity.\n", "  We discuss the potential to constrain the small-$x$ PDFs using the exclusive\nproduction of heavy vector mesons. The calculation of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$\nphotoproduction at NLO in collinear factorisation is described. The different\nbehaviour of the NLO corrections for $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ is highlighted and\nwe outline what might be expected from the inclusion of these processes in a\nPDF fit.\n", "  We present the first measurement of charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results are presented as a\nfunction of the particle transverse momentum and pseudorapidity for different\ncentralities. A finite difference between the directed flow of positive and\nnegative charged particles is observed that qualitatively agrees with the\nexpectations from the effects of the initial strong electric field between two\ncolliding ions with different nuclear charges. The measured difference in\ndirected flow is much smaller than that obtained from the\nparton-hadron-string-dynamics (PHSD) model, which suggests that most of the\nelectric charges, i.e. quarks and antiquarks, have not yet been created during\nthe lifetime of the strong electric field, which is of the order of, or less\nthan, 1fm/$c$.\n", "  Characterizing and understanding noise affecting quantum states has immense\nbenefits in spectroscopy as well as in realizing quantum devices. Transverse\nrelaxation times under a set of dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences with\nvarying interpulse delays were earlier used for obtaining the noise spectral\ndensities of single-qubit coherences. In this work, using a pair of homonuclear\nspins and NMR techniques, we experimentally characterize noise in certain\ndecoherence-free subspaces. We also explore the noise of similar states in a\nheteronuclear spin pair. Further, using a 10-qubit system, we investigate noise\nprofiles of various multiqubit coherences and study the scaling of noise with\nrespect to the coherence order. Finally, using the experimentally obtained\nnoise spectrum of the 10-qubit NOON state, we predict the performance of a\nUhrig DD sequence and verify it experimentally.\n", "  The low energy band structure of graphene has two inequivalent valleys at K\nand K' points of the Brillouin zone. The possibility to manipulate this valley\ndegree of freedom defines the field of valleytronics, the valley analogue of\nspintronics. A key requirement for valleytronic devices is the ability to break\nthe valley degeneracy by filtering and spatially splitting valleys to generate\nvalley polarized currents. Here we suggest a way to obtain valley polarization\nusing strain-induced inhomogeneous pseudomagnetic fields (PMF) which act\ndifferently on the two valleys. Notably, the suggested method does not involve\nexternal magnetic fields, or magnetic materials, as previous proposals.\n  In our proposal the strain is due to experimentally feasible nanobubbles (but\nany local deformation would do): the associated PMFs lead to different real\nspace trajectories for K and K' electrons, thus allowing the two valleys to be\naddressed individually. In this way, graphene nanobubbles can be exploited in\nboth valley filtering and valley splitting devices, and our simulations reveal\nthat a number of different functionalities are possible depending on the\ndeformation field.\n", "  The entanglement entropy, ${\\cal S}$, is an indicator of quantum correlations\nin the ground state of a many body quantum system. At a second-order quantum\nphase-transition point in one dimension ${\\cal S}$ generally has a logarithmic\nsingularity. Here we consider quantum spin chains with a first-order quantum\nphase transition, the prototype being the $Q$-state quantum Potts chain for\n$Q>4$ and calculate ${\\cal S}$ across the transition point. According to\nnumerical, density matrix renormalization group results at the first-order\nquantum phase transition point ${\\cal S}$ shows a jump, which is expected to\nvanish for $Q \\to 4^+$. This jump is calculated in leading order as $\\Delta\n{\\cal S}=\\ln Q[1-4/Q-2/(Q \\ln Q)+{\\cal O}(1/Q^2)]$.\n", "  We investigate the pre-disruption gravitational dynamics and post-disruption\nhydrodynamics of the tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) binaries. We focus on binaries with relatively low mass primaries\n($10^6M_{\\odot}$), moderate mass ratios, and separations with reasonably long\ngravitational wave inspiral times (tens of Myr). First, we generate a large\nensemble (between 1 and 10 million) of restricted three-body integrations to\nquantify the statistical properties of tidal disruptions by circular SMBH\nbinaries of initially-unbound stars. Compared to the reference case of a\ndisruption by a single SMBH, the binary potential induces significant variance\ninto the specific energy and angular momentum of the star at the point of\ndisruption. Second, we use Newtonian numerical hydrodynamics to study the\ndetailed evolution of the fallback debris from 120 disruptions randomly\nselected from the three-body ensemble (excluding only the most deeply\npenetrating encounters). We find that the overall morphology of the debris is\ngreatly altered by the presence of the second black hole, and the accretion\nrate histories display a wide range of behaviors, including order of magnitude\ndips and excesses relative to control simulations that include only one black\nhole. Complex evolution persists, in some cases, for many orbital periods of\nthe binary. We find evidence for power in the accretion curves on timescales\nrelated to the binary orbital period, though there is no exact periodicity. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of future wide-field surveys, and comment on\nthe prospects of identifying and characterizing the subset of events occurring\nin nuclei with binary SMBHs.\n", "  We study the spatial correlations between the H$\\alpha$ emission and\ndifferent types of massive stars in two local galaxies, the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC) and Messier 33. We compare these to correlations derived for\ncore-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in the literature to connect CCSNe of\ndifferent types with the initial masses of their progenitors and to test the\nvalidity of progenitor mass estimates which use the pixel statistics method. We\nobtain samples of evolved massive stars in both galaxies from catalogues with\ngood spatial coverage and/or completeness, and combine them with coordinates of\nmain-sequence stars in the LMC from the SIMBAD database. We calculate the\nspatial correlation of stars of different classes and spectral types with\nH$\\alpha$ emission. We also investigate the effects of distance, noise and\npositional errors on the pixel statistics method. A higher correlation with\nH$\\alpha$ emission is found to correspond to a shorter stellar lifespan, and we\nconclude that the method can be used as an indicator of the ages, and therefore\ninitial masses, of SN progenitors. We find that the spatial distributions of\ntype II-P SNe and red supergiants of appropriate initial mass ($\\gtrsim$9\n$M_{\\odot}$) are consistent with each other. We also find the distributions of\ntype Ic SNe and WN stars with initial masses $\\gtrsim$20 $M_{\\odot}$\nconsistent, while supergiants with initial masses around 15 $M_{\\odot}$ are a\nbetter match for type IIb and II-L SNe. The type Ib distribution corresponds to\nthe same stellar types as type II-P, which suggests an origin in interacting\nbinaries. On the other hand, we find that luminous blue variable stars show a\nmuch stronger correlation with H$\\alpha$ emission than do type IIn SNe.\n", "  We present the Data Release 12 Quasar catalog (DR12Q) from the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the SDSS-III. This catalog includes\nall SDSS-III/BOSS objects that were spectroscopically targeted as quasar\ncandidates during the full survey and that are confirmed as quasars via visual\ninspection of the spectra, have luminosities Mi[z=2]<-20.5 (in a LCDM cosmology\nwith H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega _L=0.7), and either display at\nleast one emission line with a full width at half maximum (FWHM)larger than 500\nkm/s or, if not, have interesting/complex absorption features. The catalog also\nincludes previously known quasars (mostly from SDSS-I and II) that were\nreobserved by BOSS. The catalog contains 297,301 quasars detected over 9,376\nsquare degrees with robust identification and redshift measured by a\ncombination of principal component eigenspectra. The number of quasars with\nz>2.15 is about an order of magnitude greater than the number of z>2.15 quasars\nknown prior to BOSS. Redshifts and FWHMs are provided for the strongest\nemission lines (CIV, CIII], MgII). The catalog identifies 29,580 broad\nabsorption line quasars and lists their characteristics. For each object, the\ncatalog presents five-band (u, g, r, i, z) CCD-based photometry together with\nsome information on the optical morphology and the selection criteria. When\navailable, the catalog also provides information on the optical variability of\nquasars using SDSS and PTF multi-epoch photometry. The catalog also contains\nX-ray, ultraviolet, near-infrared, and radio emission properties of the\nquasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital\nspectra, covering the wavelength region 3,600-10,500A at a spectral resolution\nin the range 1,300<R<2,500, can be retrieved from the SDSS Catalog Archive\nServer.\n", "  We calculate the temperature dependent anomalous ac Hall conductance\n$\\sigma_H(\\Omega, T)$ for a two-dimensional chiral p-wave superconductor. This\nquantity determines the polar Kerr effect, as it was observed in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$\n[J. Xia $et$ $al.$, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 167002 (2006)]. We concentrate on a\nsingle band model with arbitrary isotropic dispersion relation subjected to\nrare, weak impurities treated in the Born approximation. As we explicitly show\nby detailed computation, previously omitted contributions to extrinsic part of\nan anomalous Hall response, physically originating from diffractive skew\nscattering on quantum impurity complexes, appear to the leading order in\nimpurity concentration. By direct comparison with published results from the\nliterature we demonstrate the relevance of our findings for the interpretation\nof the Kerr effect measurements in superconductors.\n", "  We develop a model that establishes a quantitative link between the physical\nproperties of molecular aggregates and their constituent building blocks. The\nrelation is built on the coherent potential approximation, calibrated against\nexact results, and proven reliable for a wide range of parameters. It provides\na practical method to compute spectra and transfer rates in multi-chromophoric\nsystems from experimentally accessible monomer data. Applications to F\\\"orster\nenergy transfer reveal optimal transfer rates as functions of both the\nsystem-bath coupling and intra-aggregate coherence.\n", "  We demonstrate that the quantum mutual information (QMI) is a useful probe to\nstudy many-body localization (MBL). First, we focus on the detection of a\nmetal--insulator transition for two different models, the noninteracting\nAubry-Andr\\'e-Harper model and the spinless fermionic disordered Hubbard chain.\nWe find that the QMI in the localized phase decays exponentially with the\ndistance between the regions traced out, allowing us to define a correlation\nlength, which converges to the localization length in the case of one particle.\nSecond, we show how the QMI can be used as a dynamical indicator to distinguish\nan Anderson insulator phase from an MBL phase. By studying the spread of the\nQMI after a global quench from a random product state, we show that the QMI\ndoes not spread in the Anderson insulator phase but grows logarithmically in\ntime in the MBL phase.\n", "  Z CMa is a complex pre-main sequence binary with a current separation of 100\nmas, known to consist of an FU Orionis star (SE component) and an embedded\nHerbig Be star (NW component). Immediately when the late-2008 outburst of Z CMa\nwas announced to the community, we initiated a high angular resolution imaging\ncampaign with VLT/NaCo, Keck/NIRC2, VLT/SINFONI, and Keck/OSIRIS which aimed at\ncharacterizing the outburst of both components of the system in the\nnear-infrared. We confirm that the NW star dominates the system flux in the\n1.1-3.8 microns range and is responsible for the photometric outburst. We\nextract the first medium-resolution (R=2000-4000) near-infrared (1.1-2.4\nmicrons) spectra of the individual components during and after the outburst.\nThe SE component has a spectrum typical of FU Orionis objects. The NW component\nspectrum is characteristic of embedded outbursting protostars and EX Or\nobjects. It displays numerous emission lines during the outburst whose\nintensity correlates with the system activity. In particular, we find a\ncorrelation between the Brackett gamma equivalent width and the system\nbrightness. The bluing of the continuum of the NW component along with the\nabsolute flux and color-variation of the system during the outburst suggests\nthat the outburst was caused by a complex interplay between a variation of the\nextinction in the line of sight of the NW component on one hand, and the\nemission of shocked regions close to the NW component on the other. We confirm\nthe recently reported wiggling of the SE component jet from [Fe II] line\nemission. We find a point-like structure associated with a peak emission at\n2.098 microns coincidental with the clump or arm seen in broadband polarization\ndifferential imaging as well as additional diffuse emission along a PA=214\ndegrees. The origin of these two structures is unclear and deserves further\ninvestigation.\n", "  We are able to detect clear signatures of dephasing -- a distinct trait of\nMany-Body Localisation (MBL) -- via the dynamics of two-sites entanglement,\nquantified through the concurrence. Using the protocol implemented in [Science\n{\\bf 349}, 842 (2015)] we show that -- in the MBL phase -- the average two-site\nentanglement decays in time as a power law, while in the Anderson localised\nphase it tends to a plateau. The exponent of the power law is not universal and\nshows a clear dependence on the strength of the interaction. This behaviour is\nalso qualitatively different in the ergodic phase where the two-site\nentanglement decays exponentially. All the results are obtained by means of\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalisation group simulations; they are\ncorroborated by analytical calculations on an effective model. Two-site\nentanglement has been already measured in cold atoms: Our analysis paves the\nway for the first direct experimental test of many-body dephasing in the MBL\nphase.\n", "  We investigate the detectability thresholds of various modular structures in\nthe stochastic block model. Our analysis reveals how the detectability\nthreshold is related to the details of the modular pattern, including the\nhierarchy of the clusters. We show that certain planted structures are\nimpossible to infer regardless of their fuzziness.\n", "  We report the discovery of two long-term intermittent radio pulsars in the\nongoing Arecibo PALFA pulsar survey. Following discovery with the Arecibo\nTelescope, extended observations of these pulsars over several years at Jodrell\nBank Observatory have revealed the details of their rotation and radiation\nproperties. PSRs J1910+0517 and J1929+1357 show long-term extreme bi-modal\nintermittency, switching between active (ON) and inactive (OFF) emission states\nand indicating the presence of a large, hitherto unrecognised, underlying\npopulation of such objects. For PSR J1929+1357, the initial duty cycle was\nfON=0.008, but two years later this changed, quite abruptly, to fON=0.16. This\nis the first time that a significant evolution in the activity of an\nintermittent pulsar has been seen and we show that the spin-down rate of the\npulsar is proportional to the activity. The spin-down rate of PSR J1929+1357 is\nincreased by a factor of 1.8 when it is in active mode, similar to the increase\nseen in the other three known long-term intermittent pulsars.\n", "  A general formalism to construct and improve supercurrents and source or\nanomaly superfields in two-derivative N=1 supersymmetric theories is presented.\nIt includes arbitrary gauge and chiral superfields and a linear superfield\ncoupled to gauge fields. These families of supercurrent structures are\ncharacterized by their energy-momentum tensors and R currents and they display\na specific relation to the dilatation current of the theory. The linear\nsuperfield is introduced in order to describe the gauge coupling as a\nbackground (or propagating) field. Supersymmetry does not constrain the\ndependence on this gauge coupling field of gauge kinetic terms and\nholomorphicity restrictions are absent. Applying these results to an effective\n(Wilson) description of super-Yang-Mills theory, matching or cancellation of\nanomalies leads to an algebraic derivation of the all-order NSVZ beta function.\n", "  We present a calculation of $H+j$ at NLO including the effect of a finite\ntop-mass. Where possible we include the complete dependence on $m_t$. This\nincludes the leading order amplitude, the infrared poles of the two-loop\namplitude and the real radiation amplitude. The remaining finite piece of the\nvirtual correction is considered in an asymptotic expansion in $m_t$, which is\naccurate to $m_t^{-4}$. By successively including more $m_t$-exact pieces, the\ndependence on the asymptotic series diminishes and we find convergent behavior\nfor $p_T^H>m_t$ for the first time. Our results justify rescaling by the\n$m_t$-exact LO cross section to model top-mass effects in EFT results up to\n$p_T$ of 250 to 300 GeV. We show that the error made by using the LO rescaling\nbecomes comparable to the NNLO scale uncertainty for such large energies. We\nimplement our results into the Monte Carlo code MCFM.\n", "  Aims. We study the long-term variability of the well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy\nMrk 1210 (a.k.a. UGC 4203, or the Phoenix galaxy).\n  Methods. The source was observed by many X-ray facilities in the last 20\nyears. Here we present a NuSTAR observation and put the results in context of\npreviously published observations.\n  Results. NuSTAR observed Mrk 1210 in 2012 for 15.4 ks. The source showed\nCompton-thin obscuration similar to that observed by Chandra, Suzaku, BeppoSAX\nand XMM-Newton over the past two decades, but different from the first\nobservation by ASCA in 1995, in which the active nucleus was caught in a low\nflux state - or obscured by Compton-thick matter, with a reflection-dominated\nspectrum. Thanks to the high-quality hard X-ray spectrum obtained with NuSTAR\nand exploiting the long-term spectral coverage spanning 16.9 years, we can\nprecisely disentangle the transmission and reflection components and put\nconstraints on both the intrinsic long-term variability and hidden nucleus\nscenarios. In the former case, the distance between the reflector and the\nsource must be at least ~ 2 pc, while in the latter one the eclipsing cloud may\nbe identified with a water maser-emitting clump.\n", "  We study how adsorption of a near-critical binary mixture in a nanopore is\nmodified by flow inside the pore. We identify three types of steady states upon\nvariation of the pore P\\'{e}clet number (${\\rm Pe}_p$), which can be reversibly\naccessed by the application of an external pressure. Interestingly, for small\n${\\rm Pe}_p$ the pore acts as a weakly selective membrane which separates the\nmixture. For intermediate ${\\rm Pe}_p$, the flow effectively shifts the\nadsorption in the pore thereby opening possibilities for enhanced and tunable\nsolute transport through the pore. For large ${\\rm Pe}_p$, the adsorption is\nprogressively reduced inside the pore, accompanied by a long ranged dispersion\nof the mixture far from the pore.\n", "  We lay the foundations of a statistical framework for multi-catalogue\ncross-correlation and cross-identification based on explicit simplified\ncatalogue models. A proper identification process should rely on both\nastrometric and photometric data. Under some conditions, the astrometric part\nand the photometric part can be processed separately and merged a posteriori to\nprovide a single global probability of identification. The present paper\naddresses almost exclusively the astrometrical part and specifies the proper\nprobabilities to be merged with photometric likelihoods.\n  To select matching candidates in n catalogues, we used the Chi (or,\nindifferently, the Chi-square) test with 2(n-1) degrees of freedom. We thus\ncall this cross-match a chi-match. In order to use Bayes' formula, we\nconsidered exhaustive sets of hypotheses based on combinatorial analysis. The\nvolume of the Chi-test domain of acceptance -- a 2(n-1)-dimensional acceptance\nellipsoid -- is used to estimate the expected numbers of spurious associations.\nWe derived priors for those numbers using a frequentist approach relying on\nsimple geometrical considerations. Likelihoods are based on standard Rayleigh,\nChi and Poisson distributions that we normalized over the Chi-test acceptance\ndomain. We validated our theoretical results by generating and cross-matching\nsynthetic catalogues.\n  The results we obtain do not depend on the order used to cross-correlate the\ncatalogues. We applied the formalism described in the present paper to build\nthe multi-wavelength catalogues used for the science cases of the ARCHES\n(Astronomical Resource Cross-matching for High Energy Studies) project. Our\ncross-matching engine is publicly available through a multi-purpose web\ninterface. In a longer term, we plan to integrate this tool into the CDS XMatch\nService.\n", "  KIC 7177553 is a quadruple system containing two binaries of orbital periods\n16.5 and 18 d. All components have comparable masses and are slowly rotating,\nnon-evolved stars of spectral type near G2V. The longer period binary is\neclipsing with component masses and radii, M1 = 1.043 +/- 0.014 M_sun, R1 =\n0.940 +/- 0.005 R_sun, and M2 = 0.986 +/- 0.015 M_sun, R2 = 0.941 +/- 0.005\nR_sun. The essentially equal radii measurements are inconsistent with the two\nstars being on the main sequence at the same age using standard stellar\nevolution models. Instead a consistent scenario is found if the stars are in\ntheir pre-main sequence phase of evolution and have age 33 - 36 Myr. Such a\nyoung age has important implications for the detectability of the massive\nplanet indicated by eclipse time variations.\n", "  We formulate the problem of numerical analytic continuation in a way that\nlets us draw meaningful conclusions about properties of the spectral function\nbased solely on the input data. Apart from ensuring consistency with the input\ndata (within their error bars) and the {\\it a priori} and {\\it a posteriori}\n(conditional) constraints, it is crucial to reliably characterize the\naccuracy---or even ambiguity---of the output. We explain how these challenges\ncan be met with two approaches: stochastic optimization with consistent\nconstraints and the modified maximum entropy method. We perform illustrative\ntests for spectra with a double-peak structure, where we critically examine\nwhich spectral properties are accessible and which ones are lost. For an\nimportant practical example, we apply our protocol to the Fermi polaron\nproblem.\n", "  The Qatar-2 transiting exoplanet system was recently observed by the {\\it\nKepler} telescope as part of {\\it K2} Campaign 6. The photometric time series\nhas one-minute time sampling and a precision of about 690~ppm, after filtering\nout artifacts and spurious trends. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing\nevents, when the planet eclipsed a relatively dark region of the stellar\nphotosphere. The observed patterns in the sequence of these events demonstrate\nthat the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes, and\ntherefore that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10$^\\circ$. We support\nthis conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit\nidentification and timing of the events, and the other based on fitting the\nlight curves with a spotted-star model. We are also able to refine the usual\ntransit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period ($18.5 \\pm\n1.9$~days), corresponding to a 'gyrochronological' age of $1.4 \\pm 0.3$ Gyr.\nCoherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are seen\nthroughout the entire light curve. These variations are well modeled as the\ncombined effects of ellipsoidal light variations ($17.4 \\pm 2.8$~ppm) and\nDoppler boosting ($11.9 \\pm 2.5$~ppm). The magnitudes of these effects are both\nconsistent with a planetary mass of $2.6 \\pm 0.5~ M_{\\text{Jup}}$, which is in\nturn consistent with the mass determined by the Doppler technique. No\noccultations are detected, giving a 2$\\sigma$ upper limit of $0.013$ on the\nplanet's visual geometric albedo. The measured transit times are consistent\nwith a constant orbital period. In particular we find no evidence for orbital\ndecay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant\ntidal quality factor: $Q'_\\star > 1.5\\times 10^4$~(95\\% confidence).\n", "  Interlayer electron transport through a graphene / hexagonal boron-nitride\n(h-BN) / graphene heterostructure is strongly affected by the misorientation\nangle $\\theta$ of the h-BN with respect to the graphene layers with different\nphysical mechanisms governing the transport in different regimes of angle,\nFermi level, and bias. The different mechanisms and their resulting signatures\nin resistance and current are analyzed using two different models, a\ntight-binding, non-equilibrium Green function model and an effective continuum\nmodel, and the qualitative features resulting from the two different models\ncompare well. In the large-angle regime ($\\theta > 4^\\circ$), the change in the\neffective h-BN bandgap seen by an electron at the $K$ point of the graphene\ncauses the resistance to monotonically increase with angle by several orders of\nmagnitude reaching a maximum at $\\theta = 30^\\circ$. It does not affect the\npeak-to-valley current ratios in devices that exhibit negative differential\nresistance. In the small-angle regime ($\\theta < 4^\\circ$), Umklapp processes\nopen up new conductance channels that manifest themselves as non-monotonic\nfeatures in a plot of resistance versus Fermi level that can serve as\nexperimental signatures of this effect. For small angles and high bias, the\nUmklapp processes give rise to two new current peaks on either side of the\ndirect tunneling peak.\n", "  We present the discovery of a molecular cloud at zabs=2.5255 along the line\nof sight to the quasar J0000+0048. We perform a detailed analysis of the\nabsorption lines from ionic, neutral atomic and molecular species in different\nexcitation levels, as well as the broad-band dust extinction. We find that the\nabsorber classifies as a Damped Lyman-alpha system (DLA) with\nlogN(HI)(cm^-2)=20.8+/-0.1. The DLA has super-Solar metallicity with a\ndepletion pattern typical of cold gas and an overall molecular fraction ~50%.\nThis is the highest f-value observed to date in a high-z intervening system.\nMost of the molecular hydrogen arises from a clearly identified narrow (b~0.7\nkm/s), cold component in which CO molecules are also found, with logN(CO)~15.\nWe study the chemical and physical conditions in the cold gas. We find that the\nline of sight probes the gas deep after the HI-to-H2 transition in a ~4-5\npc-size cloud with volumic density nH~80 cm^-3 and temperature of only 50 K.\nOur model suggests that the presence of small dust grains (down to about 0.001\n{\\mu}m) and high cosmic ray ionisation rate (zeta_H a few times 10^-15 s^-1)\nare needed to explain the observed atomic and molecular abundances. The\npresence of small grains is also in agreement with the observed steep\nextinction curve that also features a 2175 A bump. The properties of this cloud\nare very similar to what is seen in diffuse molecular regions of the nearby\nPerseus complex. The high excitation temperature of CO rotational levels\ntowards J0000+0048 betrays however the higher temperature of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. Using the derived physical conditions, we correct for a\nsmall contribution (0.3 K) of collisional excitation and obtain TCMB(z =\n2.53)~9.6 K, in perfect agreement with the predicted adiabatic cooling of the\nUniverse. [abridged]\n", "  We demonstrate that a sizable chiral charge pumping can be achieved at room\ntemperature in graphene/Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) bilayer systems. The effect,\nwhich cannot be attributed to the ordinary spin pumping, reveals itself in the\ncreation of a dc electric field/voltage in graphene as a response to the\ndynamic magnetic excitations (spin waves) in an adjacent out-of-plane\nmagnetized YIG film. We show that the induced voltage changes its sign when the\norientation of the static magnetization is reversed, clearly indicating the\nbroken spatial inversion symmetry in the studied system. The strength of effect\nshows a non-monotonous dependence on the spin-wave frequency, in agreement with\nthe proposed theoretical model.\n", "  Recent neutron scattering observations by Plumb et al. [1] reveal that the\nground state of $FeSc_2S_4$ is magnetic with two distinct Fe environments,\ninstead of a quantum spin liquid as had been previously thought. Starting with\nthe relevant O(N)-symmetric vector model of $FeSc_2S_4$, we study how the\ndiscrete ($Z_2$) and continuous rotational symmetries are successively broken,\nyielding nematic and ordered phases. At high temperatures, we find that the\nnematic order parameter falls as $T^{-\\gamma}$ ($\\gamma>0$), and therefore,\n$FeSc_2S_4$ lacks any distinct nematic ordering temperature. This feature\nindicates that the three-dimensional diamond lattice of $FeSc_2S_4$ is highly\nsusceptible to the breaking of Ising symmetries, and explains the two distinct\nFe environments that is present even at high temperatures, as seen by\nM\\\"ossbauer and far infrared optical spectroscopy.\n", "  We present results of the numerical simulation of the two-dimensional\nThirring model at finite density and temperature. The severe sign problem is\ndealt with by deforming the domain of integration into complex field space.\nThis is the first example where a fermionic sign problem is solved in a quantum\nfield theory by using the holomorphic gradient flow approach, a generalization\nof the Lefschetz thimble method.\n", "  We study a minimal model of a crawling eukaryotic cell with a chemical\npolarity controlled by a reaction-diffusion mechanism describing Rho GTPase\ndynamics. The size, shape, and speed of the cell emerge from the combination of\nthe chemical polarity, which controls the locations where actin polymerization\noccurs, and the physical properties of the cell, including its membrane\ntension. We find in our model both highly persistent trajectories, in which the\ncell crawls in a straight line, and turning trajectories, where the cell\ntransitions from crawling in a line to crawling in a circle. We discuss the\ncontrolling variables for this turning instability, and argue that turning\narises from a coupling between the reaction-diffusion mechanism and the shape\nof the cell. This emphasizes the surprising features that can arise from simple\nlinks between cell mechanics and biochemistry. Our results suggest that similar\ninstabilities may be present in a broad class of biochemical descriptions of\ncell polarity.\n", "  Extensional rheometry and Brownian Dynamics simulations of flexible polymer\nsolutions confirm predictions based on blob concepts that coil--stretch\nhysteresis in extensional flows increases with concentration, reaching a\nmaximum at the critical overlap concentration $c^\\ast$ before progressively\nvanishing in the semidilute regime. These observations demonstrate that chain\nstretching strengthens intermolecular hydrodynamic screening in dilute\nsolutions, but weakens it in semidilute solutions. Flow can thus strongly\nmodify the concentration dependence of viscoelastic properties of polymer\nsolutions.\n", "  We study supersymmetry breaking perturbations of the simplest dual pair of\n2+1-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric field theories -- the free chiral\nmultiplet and N = 2 super-QED with a single flavor. We find dual descriptions\nof a phase diagram containing four distinct massive phases. The equivalence of\nthe intervening critical theories gives rise to several non-supersymmetric\navatars of mirror symmetry: we find dualities relating scalar QED to a free\nfermion and Wilson-Fisher theories to both scalar and fermionic QED. Thus,\nmirror symmetry can be viewed as the multicritical parent duality from which\nthese non-supersymmetric dualities directly descend.\n", "  We present the discovery of a variable optical counterpart to the\nunidentified gamma-ray source 3FGL J0212.1+5320, and argue this is a new\ncompact binary millisecond pulsar (MSP) candidate. We show 3FGL J0212.1+5320\nhosts a semi-detached binary with a 0.86955$\\pm$0.00015 d orbital period and a\nF6-type companion star at an estimated distance of D=1.1$\\pm$0.2 kpc, with a\nradial velocity curve semi-amplitude K$_2$=214.1$\\pm$5.0 km s$^{-1}$ and a\nprojected rotational velocity of Vsin(i)=73.2$\\pm$1.6 km s$^{-1}$. We find a\nhard X-ray source at the same location with a 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity\nL$_\\mathrm{X}$=2.6$\\times$10$^{32}$ (D/1.1 kpc)$^2$ erg s$^{-1}$, which\nstrengthens the MSP identification. Our results imply a mass ratio\nq=M$_2$/M$_1$=0.26$^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ if the companion star fills its Roche\nlobe, and q$\\gtrsim$0.26 in any case. This classifies 3FGL J0212.1+5320 as a\n\"redback\" binary MSP; if its MSP nature is confirmed, this will be the\nbrightest compact binary MSP in the optical band (r'$\\simeq$14.3 mag) and will\nhave the longest orbital period among Galactic field systems (nearly 21 hr).\nBased on the light curve peak-to-peak amplitude ($\\Delta$r=0.19 mag), we\nfurther suggest that the orbital inclination is high and the putative pulsar\nmass is close to canonical (M$_1$$\\simeq$1.3$-$1.6 M$_\\odot$). Finally, we\ndiscuss the lack of heating signatures and asymmetric optical light curves in\nthe context of other redback MSPs.\n", "  Here we consider an interplay between the topology of the magnetization\ntexture (which is a topological soliton, or Skyrmion) in a planar magnetic\nnano-element and the topology of the element itself (its connectivity). We\nestablish the existence of a set of constraints, coupling these topologies,\nwhich are specific for multiply connected elements and are absent in\nsimply-connected case. As an example, a specific constraint is derived for a\ncase of planar ring magnet, relating the angular positions of magnetic vortices\nand antivortices inside. We analyze the recent experimental data on the vortex\nmagnetic domain walls in the ring to validate our findings.\n", "  Recently LHCb experiments confirmed the findings of the two $P_c$ states in\nthe $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p \\pi^-$ decays. In the present work, we\ninvestigate both the $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi K^- p$ and the $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to\nJ/\\psi p \\pi^-$ decays, continuing the investigations of our former works on\nthe interactions of $J/\\psi N$ with its coupled channels by considering the\ns-/u- channel contributions. We obtain consistent results of the line-shape of\nthe $J/\\psi N$ invariant mass distribution with the LHCb experiments, and\nfavour the $P_c (4450)$ state as a $\\bar{D}^* \\Sigma_c$ bound state with\n$J=1/2^-$.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis on a primordial gravitational-wave background\namplified during a Kasner-like pre-inflationary phase allowing for general\ntriaxial anisotropies. It is found that the predicted angular distribution map\nof gravitational-wave intensity on large scales exhibits topologically\ndistinctive patterns according to the degree of the pre-inflationary\nanisotropy, thereby serving as a potential probe for the pre-inflationary early\nuniverse with future all-sky observations of gravitational waves. We also\nderive an observational limit on the amplitude of such anisotropic\ngravitational waves from the B-mode polarisation of the cosmic microwave\nbackground.\n", "  Very high magnetic anisotropies have been theoretically predicted for\nstrained Fe-Co(-X) and indeed several experiments on epitaxial thin films\nseemed to confirm strain induced anisotropy enhancement. This study presents a\ncritical analysis of the different contributions to perpendicular anisotropy:\nvolume, interface and surface anisotropies. Tracing these contributions,\nthickness series of single layer films as well as multilayers with Au-Cu\nbuffers/interlayers of different lattice parameters have been prepared. The\nanalysis of their magnetic anisotropy reveals a negligible influence of the\nlattice parameter of the buffer. Electronic effects, originating from both, the\nAu-Cu interface and the film surface, outrange the elastic effects. Surface\nanisotropy, however, exceeds the interface anisotropy by more than a factor of\nthree. A comparison with results from Density Functional Theory suggests, that\nthe experimentally observed strong perpendicular surface anisotropy originates\nfrom a deviation from an ideal oxide-free surface. Accordingly, tailored\nFe-Co-X/oxide interfaces may open a route towards high anisotropy in rare-earth\nfree materials.\n", "  We study experimentally and theoretically a coherently-driven\nstrongly-coupled quantum dot-microcavity system. Our focus is on physics of the\nunexplored intermediate excitation regime where the resonant laser field\ndresses a strongly-coupled single exciton-photon (polariton) system resulting\nin a ladder of laser-dressed Jaynes-Cummings states. In that case both the\ncoupling of the emitter to the confined light field of the microcavity and to\nthe light field of the external laser are equally important, as proved by\nobservation of injection pulling of the polariton branches by an external\nlaser. This intermediate interaction regime is of particular interest since it\nconnects the purely quantum mechanical Jaynes-Cummings ladder and the\nsemi-classical Autler-Townes ladder. Exploring the driving strength-dependence\nof the mutually coupled system we establish the maximum in the resonance\nfluorescence signal to be a robust fingerprint of the intermediate regime and\nobserve signatures indicating the laser-dressed Jaynes-Cummings ladder. In\norder to address the underlying physics we excite the coupled system via the\nmatter component of fermionic nature undergoing saturation - in contrast to\ncommonly used cavity-mediated excitation.\n", "  We study the atomic physics and the astrophysical implications of a model in\nwhich the dark matter is the analog of hydrogen in a secluded sector. The self\ninteractions between dark matter particles include both elastic scatterings as\nwell as inelastic processes due to a hyperfine transition. The self-interaction\ncross sections are computed by numerically solving the coupled Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations for this system. We show that these self interactions exhibit the\nright velocity dependence to explain the low dark matter density cores seen in\nsmall galaxies while being consistent with all constraints from observations of\nclusters of galaxies. For a viable solution, the dark hydrogen mass has to be\nin 10--100 GeV range and the dark fine-structure constant has to be larger than\n0.02. Precisely for this range of parameters, we show that significant cooling\nlosses may occur due to inelastic excitations to the hyperfine state and\nsubsequent decays, with implications for the evolution of low-mass halos and\nthe early growth of supermassive black holes. Cooling from excitations to\nhigher $n$ levels of dark hydrogen and subsequent decays is possible at the\ncluster scale, with a strong dependence on halo mass. Finally, we show that the\nminimum halo mass is in the range of $10^{3.5}$ to $10^7 M_\\odot$ for the\nviable regions of parameter space, significantly larger than the typical\npredictions for weakly-interacting dark matter models. This pattern of\nobservables in cosmological structure formation is unique to this model, making\nit possible to rule in or rule out hidden sector hydrogen as a viable dark\nmatter model.\n", "  The substructures of light bosonic (axion-like) dark matter may condense into\ncompact Bose stars. We study collapses of the critical-mass stars caused by\nattractive self-interaction of the axion-like particles and find that these\nprocesses proceed in an unexpected universal way. First, nonlinear self-similar\nevolution (called \"wave collapse\" in condensed matter physics) forces the\nparticles to fall into the star center. Second, interactions in the dense\ncenter create an outgoing stream of mildly relativistic particles which carries\naway an essential part of the star mass. The collapse stops when the star\nremnant is no longer able to support the self-similar infall feeding the\ncollisions. We shortly discuss possible astrophysical and cosmological\nimplications of these phenomena.\n", "  Using a generalized Bayesian inference method, we aim to explore the possible\ninterior structures of six selected exoplanets for which planetary mass and\nradius measurements are available in addition to stellar host abundances:\nHD~219134b, Kepler-10b, Kepler-93b, CoRoT-7b, 55~Cnc~e, and HD~97658b. We aim\nto investigate the importance of stellar abundance proxies for the planetary\nbulk composition (namely Fe/Si and Mg/Si) on prediction of planetary interiors.\nWe performed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis to formally\naccount for observational and model uncertainties while obtaining confidence\nregions of structural and compositional parameters of core, mantle, ice layer,\nocean, and atmosphere. We determined how sensitive our parameter predictions\ndepend on (1) different estimates of bulk abundance constraints and (2)\ndifferent correlations of bulk abundances between planet and host star. [...]\nAlthough the possible ranges of interior structures are large, structural\nparameters and their correlations are constrained by the sparse data. The\nprobability for the tested exoplanets to be Earth-like is generally very low.\nFurthermore, we conclude that different estimates of planet bulk abundance\nconstraints mainly affect mantle composition and core size.\n", "  We compute fluctuation-induced (Casimir) forces for classical systems after a\ntemperature quench. Using a generic coarse-grained model for fluctuations of a\nconserved density, we find that transient forces arise even if the initial and\nfinal states are force-free. In setups reminiscent of Casimir (planar walls)\nand van der Waals (small inclusions) interactions, we find comparable exact\nuniversal expressions for the force. Dynamical details only scale the time axis\nof transient force curves. We propose that such quenches can be achieved, for\ninstance, in experiments on active matter, employing tunable activity or\ninteraction protocols.\n", "  The effect of a variety of intrinsic defects and defect clusters in bulk and\nthin films of SrTiO$_3$ on ferroelectric polarization and switching mechanism\nis investigated by means of density-functional-theory (DFT) based calculations\nand the Berry phase approach. Our results show that both the titanium\nTi$_\\mathrm{Sr}^{\\bullet \\bullet}$ and strontium Sr$_\\mathrm{Ti}^{\"}$ antisite\ndefects induce ferroelectric polarization in SrTiO$_3$, with the\nTi$_\\mathrm{Sr}^{\\bullet \\bullet}$ defect causing a more pronounced spontaneous\npolarization and higher activation barriers of polarization reversal than\nSr$_\\mathrm{Ti}^{\"}$. The presence of oxygen vacancies bound to the antisite\ndefects can either enhance or diminish polarization depending on the\nconfiguration of the defect pair, but it always leads to larger activation\nbarriers of polarization switching as compared to the antisite defects with no\noxygen vacancies. We also show that the magnitude of spontaneous polarization\nin SrTiO$_3$ can be tuned by controlling the degree of Sr/Ti nonstroichiometry.\nOther intrinsic point defects such as Frenkel defect pairs and electron small\npolarons also contribute to the emergence of ferroelectric polarization in\nSrTiO$_{3}$.\n", "  Observations suggest that there is a significant fraction of O-stars in the\nfield of the Milky Way that appear to have formed in isolation or in low mass\nclusters ($<$100 $M_\\odot$). The existence of these high-mass stars that\napparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm,\nwhich requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to\nunderstand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is\nnecessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming.\nWith the $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$, we observe the seven most isolated\nmassive ($>$8 $M_\\odot$) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC). The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other\nMYSOs, OB associations, and even from known giant molecular clouds, they are\nactually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals $\\sim$100 to several hundred\npre--main-sequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously\nundetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in\nmost cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions.\nContrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations\nsuggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses\nless than 100 $M_\\odot$. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for\nisolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with\nrandom sampling of the IMF. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we\nfind evidence that isolated clusters containing O-stars can exist, which in\nitself is rare.\n", "  We aim at performing a kinematic census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in\nthe Rho Ophiuchi F core and partially in the E core of the L1688 dark cloud. We\nrun a proper motion program at the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) with the\nSon of ISAAC (SOFI) instrument over nine years in the near-infrared. We\ncomplemented these observations with various public image databases to enlarge\nthe time base of observations and the field of investigation to 0.5 deg X 0.5\ndeg. We derived positions and proper motions for 2213 objects. From these, 607\nproper motions were derived from SOFI observations with a ~1.8 mas/yr accuracy\nwhile the remaining objects were measured only from auxiliary data with a mean\nprecision of about ~3 mas/yr. We performed a kinematic analysis of the most\naccurate proper motions derived in this work, which allowed us to separate\ncluster members from field stars and to derive the mean properties of the\ncluster. From the kinematic analysis we derived a list of 68 members and 14\ncandidate members, comprising 26 new objects with a high membership\nprobability. These new members are generally fainter than the known ones. We\nmeasured a mean proper motion of (mu_RA*, mu_DEC)=(-8.2, -24.3)+/-0.8 mas/yr\nfor the L1688 dark cloud. A supervised classification was applied to\nphotometric data of members to allocate a spectral energy distribution (SED)\nclassification to the unclassified members.} We kinematically confirmed that\nthe 56 members that were known from previous studies of the Rho Ophiuchi F\ncluster and that were also part of our survey are members of the cluster, and\nwe added 26 new members. We defined the evolutionary status of the unclassified\nmembers of the cluster. We showed that a large part (23) of these new members\nare probably brown dwarfs, which multiplies the number of known substellar\nobjects in the cluster by a factor of 3.3.\n", "  In 2015, we initiated a survey of Scorpius-Centaurus A-F stars that are\npredicted to host warm-inner and cold-outer belts of debris similar to the case\nof the system HR~8799. The survey aims to resolve the disks and detect planets\nresponsible for the disk morphology. In this paper, we study the F-type star\nHIP~67497 and present a first-order modelisation of the disk in order to derive\nits main properties. We used the near-infrared integral field spectrograph\n(IFS) and dual-band imager IRDIS of VLT/SPHERE to obtain angular-differential\nimaging observations of the circumstellar environnement of HIP~67497. We\nremoved the stellar halo with PCA and TLOCI algorithms. We modeled the disk\nemission with the GRaTeR code. We resolve a ring-like structure that extends up\nto $\\sim$450 mas ($\\sim$50 au) from the star in the IRDIS and IFS data. It is\nbest reproduced by models of a non-eccentric ring with an inclination of\n$80\\pm1^{\\circ}$, a position angle of $-93\\pm1^{\\circ}$, and a semi-major axis\nof $59\\pm3$ au. We also detect an additional, but fainter, arc-like structure\nwith a larger extension (0.65 arcsec) South of the ring that we model as a\nsecond belt of debris at $\\sim$130 au. We detect 10 candidate companions at\nseparations $\\geq$1''. We estimate the mass of putative perturbers responsible\nfor the disk morphology and compare it to our detection limits. Additional data\nare needed to find those perturbers, and to relate our images to large-scale\nstructures seen with HST/STIS.\n", "  We study the classical dynamics of a membrane inside a cavity in the\nsituation where this optomechanical system possesses a reflection symmetry.\nSymmetry breaking occurs through supercritical and subcritical pitchfork\nbifurcations of the static fixed point solutions. Both bifurcations can be\nobserved through variation of the laser-cavity detuning, which gives rise to a\nboomerang-like fixed point pattern with hysteresis. The symmetry-breaking fixed\npoints evolve into self-sustained oscillations when the laser intensity is\nincreased. In addition to the analysis of the accompanying Hopf bifurcations we\ndescribe these oscillations at finite amplitudes with an ansatz that fully\naccounts for the frequency shift relative to the natural membrane frequency. We\ncomplete our study by following the route to chaos for the membrane dynamics.\n", "  We present a general method of constructing maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions. It consists of three steps: (1) picking a localized trial wave\nfunction, (2) performing a full band projection, and (3) orthonormalizing with\nthe Lowdin method. Our method is capable of producing maximally localized\nWannier functions without further minimization, and it can be applied\nstraightforwardly to random potentials without using supercells. The\neffectiveness of our method is demonstrated for both simple bands and composite\nbands.\n", "  We show under general assumptions that the mean-field approximation for quan-\ntum many-boson systems is correct. Our contribution unifies and improves on\nmost of the known results. The proof uses general properties of quantization in\ninfinite dimensional spaces, phase-space analysis and measure transportation\ntechniques.\n", "  KIC 3230227 is a short period ($P\\approx 7.0$ days) eclipsing binary with a\nvery eccentric orbit ($e=0.6$). From combined analysis of radial velocities and\n{\\it Kepler} light curves, this system is found to be composed of two A-type\nstars, with masses of $M_1=1.84\\pm 0.18M_{\\odot}$, $M_2=1.73\\pm 0.17M_{\\odot}$\nand radii of $R_1=2.01\\pm 0.09R_{\\odot}$, $R_2=1.68\\pm 0.08 R_{\\odot}$ for the\nprimary and secondary, respectively. In addition to an eclipse, the binary\nlight curve shows a brightening and dimming near periastron, making this a\nsomewhat rare eclipsing heartbeat star system. After removing the binary light\ncurve model, more than ten pulsational frequencies are present in the Fourier\nspectrum of the residuals, and most of them are integer multiples of the\norbital frequency. These pulsations are tidally driven, and both the amplitudes\nand phases are in agreement with predictions from linear tidal theory for $l=2,\nm=-2$ prograde modes.\n", "  Aims: To gain insight into the expected gas dynamics at the interface of the\nGalactic bar and spiral arms in our own Milky Way galaxy, we examine as an\nextragalactic counterpart the evidence for multiple distinct velocity\ncomponents in the cold, dense molecular gas populating a comparable region at\nthe end of the bar in the nearby galaxy NGC3627.\n  Methods: We assemble a high resolution view of molecular gas kinematics\ntraced by CO(2-1) emission and extract line-of-sight velocity profiles from\nregions of high and low gas velocity dispersion.\n  Results: The high velocity dispersions arise with often double-peaked or\nmultiple line-profiles. We compare the centroids of the different velocity\ncomponents to expectations based on orbital dynamics in the presence of bar and\nspiral potential perturbations. A model of the region as the interface of two\ngas-populated orbits families supporting the bar and the independently rotating\nspiral arms provides an overall good match to the data. An extent of the bar to\nthe corotation radius of the galaxy is favored.\n  Conclusions: Using NGC3627 as an extragalactic example, we expect situations\nlike this to favor strong star formation events such as observed in our own\nMilky Way since gas can pile up at the crossings between the orbit families.\nThe relative motions of the material following these orbits is likely even more\nimportant for the build up of high density in the region. The surface densities\nin NGC3627 are also so high that shear at the bar end is unlikely to\nsignificantly weaken the star formation activity. We speculate that scenarios\nin which the bar and spiral rotate at two different pattern speeds may be the\nmost favorable for intense star formation at such interfaces.\n", "  Recently, the existence of a candidate a-function for renormalisable theories\nin three dimensions was demonstrated for a general theory at leading order and\nfor a scalar-fermion theory at next-to-leading order. Here we extend this work\nby constructing the a-function at next-to-leading order for an N=2\nsupersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. This increase in precision for the\na-function necessitated the evaluation of the underlying renormalization-group\nfunctions at four loops.\n", "  We present an extensive study of two-dimensional Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO)\nsuperfluidity in a spin-imbalanced two-component atomic Fermi gas. In the\ncontext of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin- Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, we explore a wide\nand generic class of pairing gap functions with ex- plicit spatial dependency.\nThe mean-field theory of such phases is applied through the Bogoliubov-de\nGennes equations in which the pairing gap can be determined self-consistently.\nIn order to systemat- ically explore the configuration space we consider both\nthe canonical and grand canonical ensembles where we control the polarization\nor chemical potentials of the system, respectively. The mean-field calculations\nenable us to understand the nature of the phase transitions in the fully paired\nBardeen- Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state, exotic LO phase, and partially\npolarized free Fermi gas. The order of the phase transitions has been examined\nand in particular we find a weak first-order phase transition between the\nexotic inhomogeneous LO phase and the BCS phase. In comparison to the\nthree-dimensional case, where the phase diagram is dominated by a generic\nseparation phase, we predict a broader parameter space for the spatially\ninhomogeneous LO phase. By computing the superfluid density of the LO phase at\ndifferent polarization, we show how the superfluidity of the system is\nsuppressed with increasing spin polarization.\n", "  We study the impact of Cu intercalation on the charge density wave (CDW) in\n1T-Cu$_{\\text{x}}$TiSe$_{\\text{2}}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy. Cu atoms, identified through density functional theory modeling,\nare found to intercalate randomly on the octahedral site in the van der Waals\ngap and to dope delocalized electrons near the Fermi level. While the CDW\nmodulation period does not depend on Cu content, we observe the formation of\ncharge stripe domains at low Cu content (x$<$0.02) and a breaking up of the\ncommensurate order into 2$\\times$2 domains at higher Cu content. The latter\nshrink with increasing Cu concentration and tend to be phase-shifted. These\nfindings invalidate a proposed excitonic pairing as the primary CDW formation\nmechanism in this material.\n", "  Gravitational collapse of molecular cloud or cloud core/clump may lead to the\nformation of geometrically flattened, rotating accretion flow surrounding the\nnew born star or star cluster. Gravitational instability may occur in such\naccretion flow when the gas to stellar mass ratio is high (e.g. over\n$\\sim$10\\%). This paper takes the OB cluster-forming region G10.6-0.4 as an\nexample. We introduce the enclosed gas mass around its central ultra compact\n(UC) H\\textsc{ii} region, addresses the gravitational stability of the\naccreting gas, and outline the observed potential signatures of gravitational\ninstability. The position-velocity (PV) diagrams of various molecular gas\ntracers on G10.6-0.4 consistently show asymmetry in the spatial and the\nvelocity domain. We deduce the morphology of the dense gas accretion flow by\nmodeling velocity distribution of the azimuthally asymmetric gas structures,\nand by directly de-projecting the PV diagrams. We found that within the 0.3 pc\nradius, an infall velocity of 1-2 km\\,s$^{-1}$ may be required to explain the\nobserved PV diagrams. In addition, the velocity distribution traced in the PV\ndiagrams can be interpreted by spiral arm-like structures, which may be\nconnected with exterior infalling gas filaments. The morphology of dense gas\nstructures we propose appears very similar to the spatially resolved gas\nstructures around the OB cluster-forming region G33.92+0.11 with similar gas\nmass and size, which however is likely to be approximately in a face-on\nprojection. The dense gas accretion flow around G10.6-0.4 appears to be Toomre\nunstable, which is consistent with the existence of large-scale spiral arm-like\nstructures, and the formation of localize gas condensations.\n", "  Quantum systems can display particle- or wave-like properties, depending on\nthe type of measurement that is performed on them. The Bell-state quantum\neraser is an experiment that brings the duality to the forefront, as a single\nmeasurement can retroactively be made to measure particle-like or wave-like\nproperties (or anything in between). Here we develop a unitary\ninformation-theoretic description of this (and several related) quantum\nmeasurement situations that sheds light on the trade-off between the quantum\nand classical features of the measurement. In particular, we show that both the\ncoherence of the quantum state and the classical information obtained from it\ncan be described using quantum-information-theoretic tools only, and that those\ntwo measures satisfy an equality on account of the chain rule for entropies.\nThe coherence information and the which-path information have simple\ninterpretations in terms of state preparation and state determination, and\nsuggest ways to account for the relationship between the classical and the\nquantum world.\n", "  Most viable models of Type Ia supernovae (SN~Ia) require the thermonuclear\nexplosion of a carbon/oxygen white dwarf that has evolved in a binary system.\nRotation could be an important aspect of any model for SN~Ia, whether single or\ndouble degenerate, with the white dwarf mass at, below, or above the\nChandrasekhar limit. {\\sl Differential rotation} is specifically invoked in\nattempts to account for the apparent excess mass in the super--Chandrasekhar\nevents. Some earlier work has suggested that only uniform rotation is\nconsistent with the expected mechanisms of angular momentum transport in white\ndwarfs, while others have found pronounced differential rotation. We show that\nif the baroclinic instability is active in degenerate matter and the effects of\nmagnetic fields are neglected, both nearly-uniform and strongly-differential\nrotation are possible. We classify rotation regimes in terms of the Richardson\nnumber, Ri. At small values of Ri $\\leq$ 0.1, we find both the low-viscosity\nZahn regime with a non-monotonic angular velocity profile and a new\ndifferential rotation regime for which the viscosity is high and scales\nlinearly with the shear, $\\sigma$. Employment of Kelvin-Helmholtz viscosity\nalone yields differential rotation. Large values of Ri $\\gg$ 1 produce a regime\nof nearly-uniform rotation for which the baroclinic viscosity is of\nintermediate value and scales as $\\sigma^3$. We discuss the gap in\nunderstanding of the behavior at intermediate values of Ri and how observations\nmay constrain the rotation regimes attained by nature.\n", "  Steady state properties of a driven tracer moving in a narrow two dimensional\n(2D) channel of quiescent medium are studied. The tracer drives the system out\nof equilibrium, perturbs the density and pressure fields, and gives the bath\nparticles a nonzero average velocity, creating a current in the channel. Three\nmodels in which the confining effect of the channel is probed are analyzed and\ncompared in this study: the first is the simple symmetric exclusion process\n(SSEP), for which the stationary density profile and the pressure on the walls\nin the frame of the tracer are computed. We show that the tracer acts like a\ndipolar source in an average velocity field. The spatial structure of this 2D\nstrip is then simplified to a one dimensional SSEP, in which exchanges of\nposition between the tracer and the bath particles are allowed. Using a\ncombination of mean field theory and exact solution in the limit where no\nexchange is allowed, gives good predictions of the velocity of the tracer and\nthe density field. Finally, we show that results obtained for the 1D SSEP with\nexchanges also apply to a gas of overdamped hard disks in a narrow channel. The\ncorrespondence between the parameters of the SSEP and of the gas of hard disks\nis systematic and follows from simple intuitive arguments. Our analytical\nresults are checked numerically.\n", "  The dynamical fluctuation and correlation of multiplicity distributions of\nidentified baryons and antibaryons produced by the hadronization of the bulk\nquark system are systematically studied in quark combination model. Starting\nfrom the most basic dynamics of quark combination which are necessary for\nmultiplicity study, we analyze moments (variance, skewness and kurtosis) of\ninclusive multiplicity distribution of identified baryons, two-baryon\nmultiplicity correlations, and baryon-antibaryon multiplicity correlations\nafter the hadronization of quark system with given quark number and antiquark\nnumber. We obtain a series of interesting findings, e.g., binomial behavior of\nmultiplicity moments, coincide flavor dependent two-baryon correlation and\nuniversal baryon-antibaryon correlation, which can be regarded as general\nfeatures of quark combination. We further take into account correlations and\nfluctuations of quark numbers before hadronization to study their influence on\nmultiple production of baryons and antibaryons. We find that quark number\nfluctuation and flavor conservation lead to a series of important results such\nas the negative $p\\bar{\\Omega}^{+}$ multiplicity correlation and universal\ntwo-baryon correlations. We also study the influence of resonance decay in\norder to compare our results with future experimental data in\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at LHC.\n", "  Lead chalcogenides such as PbS, PbSe, and PbTe are of interest for their\nexceptional thermoelectric properties and strongly anharmonic lattice dynamics.\nAlthough PbTe has received the most attention, PbSe has a lower thermal\nconductivity despite being stiffer, a trend that prior first-principles\ncalculations have not reproduced. Here, we use ab-initio calculations that\nexplicitly account for strong anharmonicity to identify the origin of this low\nthermal conductivity as an anomalously large anharmonic interaction, exceeding\nin strength that in PbTe, between the transverse optic and longitudinal\nacoustic branches. The strong anharmonicity is reflected in the striking\nobservation of an intrinsic localized mode that forms in the acoustic\nfrequencies. Our work shows the deep insights into thermal phonons that can be\nobtained from ab-initio calculations that are not confined to the weak limit of\nanharmonicity.\n", "  We systematically study the tidal deformability for neutron and hyperon stars\nusing relativistic mean field (RMF) equations of state (EOSs). The tidal effect\nplays an important role during the early part of the evolution of compact\nbinaries. Although, the deformability associated with the EOSs has a small\ncorrection, it gives a clean gravitational wave signature in binary inspiral.\nThese are characterized by various love numbers kl (l=2, 3, 4), that depend on\nthe EOS of a star for a given mass and radius. The tidal effect of star could\nbe efficiently measured through advanced LIGO detector from the final stages of\ninspiraling binary neutron star (BNS) merger.\n", "  Stellar activity and convection-related surface structures might cause bias\nin planet detection and characterization that use these transits. Surface\nconvection simulations help to quantify the granulation signal. We used\nrealistic three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical simulations from the\nStagger grid and synthetic images computed with the radiative transfer code\nOptim3D to model the transits of three prototype planets: a hot Jupiter, a hot\nNeptune, and a terrestrial planet. We computed intensity maps from RHD\nsimulations of the Sun and a K-dwarf star at different wavelength bands from\noptical to far-infrared. We modeled the transit using synthetic stellar-disk\nimages and emulated the temporal variation of the granulation intensity. We\nidentified two types of granulation noise that act simultaneously during the\nplanet transit: (i) the intrinsic change in the granulation pattern with\ntimescales smaller than the usual planet transit, and (ii) the fact that the\ntransiting planet occults isolated regions of the photosphere that differ in\nlocal surface brightness. Our modeling approach shows that the granulation\npattern has a non-negligible effect on the light curve depth during the\ntransit, and, consequentially on the determination of the radius of the planet\ntransiting. The granulation noise appears to be correlated among the different\nwavelength ranges either in the visible or in the infrared regions. The\ngranulation has to be considered as an intrinsic uncertainty (as a result of\nstellar variability) on the precise measurements of exoplanet transits of\nplanets. The full characterization of the granulation is essential for\ndetermining the degree of uncertainty on the planet parameters. In this\ncontext, the use of 3D RHD simulations is important to measure the\nconvection-related fluctuations.\n", "  We calculate the evolution of gas giant planets during the runaway gas\naccretion phase of formation, to understand how the luminosity of young giant\nplanets depends on the accretion conditions. We construct steady-state envelope\nmodels, and run time-dependent simulations of accreting planets with the\nModules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code. We show that the\nevolution of the internal entropy depends on the contrast between the internal\nadiabat and the entropy of the accreted material, parametrized by the shock\ntemperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$. At low temperatures ($T_0\\lesssim\n300$--$1000\\ {\\rm K}$, depending on model parameters), the accreted material\nhas a lower entropy than the interior. The convection zone extends to the\nsurface and can drive a large luminosity, leading to rapid cooling and cold\nstarts. For higher temperatures, the accreted material has a larger entropy\nthan the interior, giving a radiative zone that stalls cooling. For $T_0\\gtrsim\n2000\\ {\\rm K}$, the surface--interior entropy contrast cannot be accommodated\nby the radiative envelope, and the accreted matter accumulates with high\nentropy, forming a hot start. The final state of the planet depends on the\nshock temperature, accretion rate, and starting entropy at the onset of runaway\naccretion. Cold starts with $L\\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-6}\\ L_\\odot$ require low\naccretion rates and starting entropy, and that the temperature of the accreting\nmaterial is maintained close to the nebula temperature. If instead the\ntemperature is near the value required to radiate the accretion luminosity,\n$4\\pi R^2\\sigma T_0^4\\sim (GM\\dot M/R)$, as suggested by previous work on\nradiative shocks in the context of star formation, gas giant planets form in a\nhot start with $L\\sim 10^{-4}\\ L_\\odot$.\n", "  The matching problem is a notorious combinatorial optimization problem that\nhas attracted for many years the attention of the statistical physics\ncommunity. Here we analyze the Euclidean version of the problem, i.e. the\noptimal matching problem between points randomly distributed on a\n$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, where the cost to minimize depends on the\npoints' pairwise distances. Using Mayer's cluster expansion we write a formal\nexpression for the replicated action that is suitable for a saddle point\ncomputation. We give the diagrammatic rules for each term of the expansion, and\nwe analyze in detail the one-loop diagrams. A characteristic feature of the\ntheory, when diagrams are perturbatively computed around the mean field part of\nthe action, is the vanishing of the mass at zero momentum. In the non-Euclidean\ncase of uncorrelated costs instead, we predict and numerically verify an\nanomalous scaling for the sub-sub-leading correction to the asymptotic average\ncost.\n", "  We present a robust but still efficient simulation approach for\nhigh-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy with a flexible tip apex showing\nsharp submolecular features. The approach takes into account the electronic\nstructure of sample and tip and relaxation of the tip apex. We validate our\nmodel by achieving good agreement with various experimental images which allows\nus to explain the origin of several observed features. Namely, we have found\nthat high-resolution STM mechanism consists of the standard STM imaging,\nconvolving electronic states of the sample and the tip apex orbital structure,\nwith the contrast heavily distorted by the relaxation of the flexible apex\ncaused by interaction with the substrate.\n", "  The influence of electron--phonon interactions on the dynamics of a quantum\ndot coupled to a photonic cavity mode is investigated using a nonequilibrium\nGreen's function approach. Within a polaron frame, the self-consistent-Born\napproximation is used to treat the phonon-assisted scattering processes between\nthe quantum dot polaron and the cavity. Two-time correlators of the quantum\ndot-cavity system are calculated by solving the Kadanoff-Baym equations, giving\naccess to photon spectra and photon indistinguishability. The non-Markovian\nnature of the interaction with the phonon bath is shown to be very accurately\ndescribed by our method in various regime of cavity-quantum electrodynamics\n(cavity-QED). The indistinguishability of the emitted photons emitted at zero\ntemperature are found to be in very good agreement with a previously reported\nexact diagonalization approach [Phys.~Rev.~B~87,~081308~(2013)]. Besides, our\nmethod enables the calculations of photon indistinguishability at finite\ntemperatures and for strong electron-phonon interactions. More generally, our\nmethod opens new avenues in the study of open quantum system dynamics coupled\nto non-Markovian environments.\n", "  We present broad-band, multi-epoch X-ray spectroscopy of the pulsating\nultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 5907. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR data from 2014 are best described by a multi-color black-body model with\na temperature gradient as a function of accretion disk radius significantly\nflatter than expected for a standard thin accretion disk (T(r) ~ r^{-p}, with\np=0.608^{+0.014}_{-0.012}). Additionally, we detect a hard power-law tail at\nenergies above 10 keV, which we interpret as being due to Comptonization. We\ncompare this observation to archival XMM-Newton, Chandra, and NuSTAR data from\n2003, 2012, and 2013, and investigate possible spectral changes as a function\nof phase over the 78d super-orbital period of this source. We find that\nobservations taken around phases 0.3-0.4 show very similar temperature\nprofiles, even though the observed flux varies significantly, while one\nobservation taken around phase 0 has a significantly steeper profile. We\ndiscuss these findings in light of the recent discovery that the compact object\nis a neutron star and show that precession of the accretion disk or the neutron\nstar can self-consistently explain most observed phenomena.\n", "  Context: While classical models successfully reproduce intensities of many\ntransition region lines, they predict helium EUV line intensities roughly an\norder of magnitude lower than the observed value.\n  Aims: To determine the relevant formation mechanism(s) of the helium EUV\nresonance lines, capable of explaining the high intensities under quiet sun\nconditions.\n  Methods: We synthesise and study the emergent spectra from a 3D\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulation model. The effects of coronal\nillumination and non-equilibrium ionisation of hydrogen and helium are included\nself-consistently in the numerical simulation.\n  Results: Radiative transfer calculations result in helium EUV line\nintensities that are an order of magnitude larger than the intensities\ncalculated under the classical assumptions. The enhanced intensity of He I 584\nis primarily caused by He II recombination cascades. The enhanced intensity of\nHe II 304 and He II 256 is caused primarily by non-equilibrium helium\nionisation.\n  Conclusion: The analysis shows that the long standing problem of the high\nhelium EUV line intensities disappears when taking into account optically thick\nradiative transfer and non-equilibrium ionisation effects.\n", "  Small temperature anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background can be\nsourced by density perturbations via the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe\neffect. Large voids and superclusters are excellent environments to make a\nlocalized measurement of this tiny imprint. In some cases excess signals have\nbeen reported. We probed these claims with an independent data set, using the\nfirst year data of the Dark Energy Survey in a different footprint, and using a\ndifferent super-structure finding strategy. We identified 52 large voids and\n102 superclusters at redshifts $0.2 < z < 0.65$. We used the Jubilee simulation\nto a priori evaluate the optimal ISW measurement configuration for our\ncompensated top-hat filtering technique, and then performed a stacking\nmeasurement of the CMB temperature field based on the DES data. For optimal\nconfigurations, we detected a cumulative cold imprint of voids with $\\Delta\nT_{f} \\approx -5.0\\pm3.7~\\mu K$ and a hot imprint of superclusters $\\Delta\nT_{f} \\approx 5.1\\pm3.2~\\mu K$ ; this is $\\sim1.2\\sigma$ higher than the\nexpected $|\\Delta T_{f}| \\approx 0.6~\\mu K$ imprint of such super-structures in\n$\\Lambda$CDM. If we instead use an a posteriori selected filter size\n($R/R_{v}=0.6$), we can find a temperature decrement as large as $\\Delta T_{f}\n\\approx -9.8\\pm4.7~\\mu K$ for voids, which is $\\sim2\\sigma$ above $\\Lambda$CDM\nexpectations and is comparable to previous measurements made using SDSS\nsuper-structure data.\n", "  Active Brownian particles (ABPs) represent a minimal model of active matter\nconsisting of self-propelled spheres with purely repulsive interactions and\nrotational noise. Here, we examine the pressure of ABPs in two dimensions in\nboth closed boxes and systems with periodic boundary conditions and show that\nits nonmonotonic behavior with density is a robust feature, independent of\nsystem size. We correlate the time evolution of the mean pressure towards its\nsteady state value with the kinetics of motility-induced phase separation. For\nparameter values corresponding to phase separated steady states, we identify\ntwo dynamical regimes. The pressure grows monotonically in time during the\ninitial regime of rapid cluster formation, overshooting its steady state value\nand then quickly relaxing to it, and remains constant during the subsequent\nslower period of cluster coalescence and coarsening. The overshoot is a\ndistinctive feature of active systems.\n", "  We numerically study the dynamics after a parameter quench in the\none-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions\n($\\propto 1/r^\\alpha$ with distance $r$), for finite chains and also directly\nin the thermodynamic limit. In nonequilibrium, i.e., before the system settles\ninto a thermal state, we find a long-lived regime that is characterized by a\nprethermal value of the magnetization, which in general differs from its\nthermal value. We find that the ferromagnetic phase is stabilized dynamically:\nas a function of the quench parameter, the prethermal magnetization shows a\ntransition between a symmetry-broken and a symmetric phase, even for those\nvalues of $\\alpha$ for which no finite-temperature transition occurs in\nequilibrium. The dynamical critical point is shifted with respect to the\nequilibrium one, and the shift is found to depend on $\\alpha$ as well as on the\nquench parameters.\n", "  Active regions (ARs) are the main sources of variety in solar dynamic events.\nAutomated detection and identification tools need to be developed for solar\nfeatures for a deeper understanding of the solar cycle. Of particular interest\nhere are the dynamical properties of the ARs, regardless of their internal\nstructure and sunspot distribution. We studied the oscillatory dynamics of two\nARs: NOAA 11327 and NOAA 11726 using two different methods of pattern\nrecognition. We developed a novel method of automated AR border detection and\ncompared it to an existing method for the proof-of-concept. The first method\nuses least-squares fitting on the smallest ellipse enclosing the AR, while the\nsecond method applies regression on the convex hull.} After processing the\ndata, we found that the axes and the inclination angle of the ellipse and the\nconvex hull oscillate in time. These oscillations are interpreted as the second\nharmonic of the standing long-period kink oscillations (with the node at the\napex) of the magnetic flux tube connecting the two main sunspots of the ARs. In\nboth ARs we have estimated the distribution of the phase speed magnitude along\nthe magnetic tubes (along the two main spots) by interpreting the obtained\noscillation of the inclination angle as the standing second harmonic kink mode.\nAfter comparing the obtained results for fast and slow kink modes, we conclude\nthat both of these modes are good candidates to explain the observed\noscillations of the AR inclination angles, as in the high plasma $\\beta$ regime\nthe phase speeds of these modes are comparable and on the order of the\nAlfv\\'{e}n speed. Based on the properties of the observed oscillations, we\ndetected the appropriate depth of the sunspot patterns, which coincides with\nestimations made by helioseismic methods. The latter analysis can be used as a\nbasis for developing a magneto-seismological tool for ARs.\n", "  We study optical response of a resonant medium possessing nonlinear coupling\nto external field driven by a few-cycle pump pulse sequence. We demonstrate the\npossibility to directly produce unipolar half-cycle pulses from the medium\npossessing an arbitrary nonlinearity, by choosing the proper pulse-to-pulse\ndistance of the pump pulses in the sequence. We examine the various ways of the\nshaping of the medium response using different geometrical configurations of\nnonlinear oscillators and different wavefront shapes for the excitation pulse\nsequence. Our approach defines a general framework to produce unipolar pulses\nof controllable form.\n", "  In this exploratory qualitative study, we describe instructors' self-reported\npractices for teaching and assessing students' ability to troubleshoot in\nelectronics lab courses. We collected audio data from interviews with 20\nelectronics instructors from 18 institutions that varied by size, selectivity,\nand other factors. In addition to describing participants' instructional\npractices, we characterize their perceptions about the role of troubleshooting\nin electronics, the importance of the ability to troubleshoot more generally,\nand what it means for students to be competent troubleshooters. One major\nfinding of this work is that, while almost all instructors in our study said\nthat troubleshooting is an important learning outcome for students in\nelectronics lab courses, only half of instructors said they directly assessed\nstudents' ability to troubleshoot. Based on our findings, we argue that there\nis a need for research-based instructional materials that attend to both\ncognitive and non-cognitive aspects of troubleshooting proficiency. We also\nidentify several areas for future investigation related to troubleshooting\ninstruction in electronics lab courses.\n", "  We present a combined DFT and model Hamiltonian analysis of spin-orbit\ncoupling in graphene induced by copper adatoms in the bridge and top positions,\nrepresenting isolated atoms in the dilute limit. The orbital physics in both\nsystems is found to be surprisingly similar, given the fundamental difference\nin the local symmetry. In both systems the Cu p and d contributions at the\nFermi level are very similar. Based on the knowledge of orbital effects we\nidentify that the main cause of the locally induced spin-orbit couplings are Cu\np and d orbitals. By employing the DFT+U formalism as an analysis tool we find\nthat both the p and d orbital contributions are equally important to spin-orbit\ncoupling, although p contributions to the density of states are much higher. We\nfit the DFT data with phenomenological tight-binding models developed\nseparately for the top and bridge positions. Our model Hamiltonians describe\nthe low-energy electronic band structure in the whole Brillouin zone and allow\nus to extract the size of the spin-orbit interaction induced by the local Cu\nadatom to be in the tens of meV. By application of the phenomenological models\nto Green's function techniques, we find that copper atoms act as resonant\nimpurities in graphene with large lifetimes of 50 and 100~fs for top and\nbridge, respectively.\n", "  Metasurfaces with tunable spatial phase functions could benefit numerous\napplications. Currently, most approaches to tuning rely on mechanical\nstretching which cannot control phase locally, or by modulating the refractive\nindex to exploit rapid phase changes with the drawback of also modulating\namplitude. Here, we propose a method to realize phase modulation at\nsubwavelength length scales while maintaining unity amplitude. Our device is\ninspired by an asymmetric Fabry-Perot resonator, with pixels comprising a\nscattering nanopost on top of a distributed Bragg reflector, capable of\nproviding a nearly 2{\\pi} nonlinear phase shift with less than 2% refractive\nindex modulation. Using the designed pixels, we simulate a tunable metasurface\ncomposed of an array of moderately coupled nanopost resonators, realizing\naxicons, vortex beam generators, and aspherical lenses with both variable focal\nlength and in-plane scanning capability, achieving nearly diffraction-limited\nperformance. The experimental feasibility of the proposed method is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a computationally efficient approach to perform large-scale\nall-electron density functional theory calculations by enriching the classical\nfinite element basis with compactly supported atom-centered numerical basis\nfunctions that are constructed from the solution of the Kohn-Sham (KS) problem\nfor single atoms. We term these numerical basis functions as enrichment\nfunctions, and the resultant basis as the enriched finite element basis. The\nenrichment functions are compactly supported through the use of smooth cutoff\nfunctions, which enhances the conditioning and maintains the locality of the\nbasis. The integrals involved in the evaluation of the discrete KS Hamiltonian\nand overlap matrix in the enriched finite element basis are computed using an\nadaptive quadrature grid based on the characteristics of enrichment functions.\nFurther, we propose an efficient scheme to invert the overlap matrix by using a\nblock-wise matrix inversion in conjunction with special reduced-order\nquadrature rules to transform the discrete Kohn-Sham problem to a standard\neigenvalue problem. Finally, we solve the resulting standard eigenvalue problem\nby using a Chebyshev polynomial based filtering technique to compute the\nrelevant eigenspectrum. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency and parallel\nscalability of the proposed method on semiconducting and heavy-metallic systems\nof various sizes, with the largest system containing 8694 electrons. We obtain\naccuracies in the ground-state energies that are within $\\sim 1$mHa with\nground-state energies obtained from classical finite element as well as\ngaussian basis sets. We observe a $50-300$ and $\\sim 8$ fold reduction in the\noverall computational time when compared to classical finite element and\ngaussian basis, respectively. We also observe good parallel scalability up to\n384 processors for a benchmark system comprising of 280-atom silicon\nnano-cluster.\n", "  Context. Origin and evolution of blue stragglers in globular clusters is\nstill a matter of debate. Aims. The aim of the present investigation is to\nreproduce the evolutionary history of four binary blue stragglers in four\ndifferent clusters, for which precise values of global parameters are known.\nMethods. Using the model for cool close binary evolution, developed by one of\nus (KS), progenitors of all investigated binaries were found and their\nparameters evolved into the presently observed values. Results. The results\nshow that the progenitors of the binary blue stragglers are cool close binaries\nwith period of a few days, which transform into stragglers by rejuvenation of\nthe initially less massive component by mass transfer from its more massive\ncompanion overflowing the inner critical Roche surface. The parameters of V209\nfrom \\omega Cen indicate that the binary is substantially enriched in helium.\nThis is an independent and strong evidence for the existence of the helium rich\nsubpopulation in this cluster.\n", "  We present multiple-epoch measurements of the size and surface brightness of\nthe light echoes from supernova (SN) 2014J in the nearby starburst galaxy M82.\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC images were taken ~277 and ~416 days after\nB-band maximum in the filters F475W, F606W, and F775W. Observations with HST\nWFC3/UVIS images at epochs ~216 and ~365 days (Crotts 2015) are included for a\nmore complete analysis. The images reveal the temporal evolution of at least\ntwo major light-echo components. The first one exhibits a filled ring structure\nwith position-angle-dependent intensity. This radially extended, diffuse echo\nindicates the presence of an inhomogeneous interstellar dust cloud ranging from\n~100 pc to ~500 pc in the foreground of the SN. The second echo component\nappears as an unresolved luminous quarter-circle arc centered on the SN. The\nwavelength dependence of scattering measured in different dust components\nsuggests that the dust producing the luminous arc favors smaller grain sizes,\nwhile that causing the diffuse light echo may have sizes similar to those of\nthe Milky Way dust. Smaller grains can produce an optical depth consistent with\nthat along the supernova-Earth line of sight measured by previous studies\naround maximum light. Therefore, it is possible that the dust slab, from which\nthe luminous arc arises, is also responsible for most of the extinction towards\nSN 2014J. The optical depths determined from the Milky Way-like dust in the\nscattering matters are lower than that produced by the dust slab.\n", "  With the help of high-resolution long-slit and integral-field spectroscopy\nobservations, the number of confirmed cases of galaxies with counterrotation is\nincreasing rapidly. The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far\nfrom being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of\ncounterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of $N$-body simulations.\nWe show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally\nstable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk\nheating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such\nconclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical\nvalues of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R} \\approx 0.5$, for which the role of pressure anisotropy\nshould be unimportant. We note that, during evolution, the $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R}$ ratio tends to rise up to values close to unity in the case\nof locally Jeans-stable disks, whereas in disks that are initially\nJeans-unstable it may reach even higher values, especially in the innermost\nregions. This unusual behavior of the $\\sigma_{\\rm z}/\\sigma_{\\rm R}$ ratio in\ngalaxies with counterrotation appears not to have been noticed earlier. Our\ninvestigations of systems made of two counterrotating components with different\nmass-ratios suggest that even apparently normal disk galaxies (i.e., with a\nminor counterrotating component so as to escape detection in current\nobservations) might be subject to significant disk heating especially in the\nvertical direction.\n", "  We study the circular Wilson loop in the symmetric representation of U(N) in\n$\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM). In the large N limit, we computed the\nexponentially-suppressed corrections for strong coupling, which suggests\nnon-perturbative physics in the dual holographic theory. We also computed the\nnext-to-leading order term in 1/N, and the result matches with the exact result\nfrom the k-fundamental representation.\n", "  We study the intrinsic, disorder-induced decoherence of an isolated quantum\nsystem under its own dynamics. Specifically, we investigate the characteristic\ntime scale (i.e., the decoherence time) associated with an interacting\nmany-body system losing the memory of its initial state. To characterize the\nerasure of the initial state memory, we define a time scale, the intrinsic\ndecoherence time, by thresholding the gradual decay of the disorder-averaged\nreturn probability. We demonstrate the system-size independence of the\nintrinsic decoherence time in different models, and we study its dependence on\nthe disorder strength. We find that the intrinsic decoherence time increases\nmonotonically as the disorder strength increases in accordance with the\nrelaxation of locally measurable quantities. We investigate several interacting\nspin (e.g., Ising and Heisenberg) and fermion (e.g., Anderson and\nAubry-Andr\\'e) models to obtain the intrinsic decoherence time as a function of\ndisorder and interaction strength.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulation is an unbiased numerical tool for studying classical\nand quantum many-body systems. One of its bottlenecks is the lack of general\nand efficient update algorithm for large size systems close to phase transition\nor with strong frustrations, for which local updates perform badly. In this\nwork, we propose a new general-purpose Monte Carlo method, dubbed self-learning\nMonte Carlo (SLMC), in which an efficient update algorithm is first learned\nfrom the training data generated in trial simulations and then used to speed up\nthe actual simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency of SLMC in a spin model at\nthe phase transition point, achieving a 10-20 times speedup.\n", "  The linear in mass ratio correction to the periapsis advance of equatorial\norbits around a spinning black hole is calculated for the first time and to\nvery high precision, providing a key benchmark for different approaches\nmodelling spinning binaries. The high precision of the calculation is leveraged\nto discriminate between two recent incompatible derivations of the 4PN\nequations of motion. Finally, the limit of the periapsis advance near the\ninnermost stable orbit (ISCO) allows determination of the ISCO shift,\nvalidating previous calculations using the first law of binary mechanics.\nCalculation of the ISCO shift is further extended into the near extremal regime\n(with spins up to $1-a=10^{-20}$), revealing new unexpected phenomenology. In\nparticular, we find that the shift of the ISCO does not have a well defined\nextremal limit, but instead continues to oscillate.\n", "  We have searched for proton decay via $p \\rightarrow e^{+} \\pi^{0}$ and $p\n\\rightarrow \\mu^{+} \\pi^{0}$ using Super-Kamiokande data from April 1996 to\nMarch 2015, 0.306 megaton$\\cdot$years exposure in total. The atmospheric\nneutrino background rate in Super-Kamiokande IV is reduced to almost half that\nof phase I-III by tagging neutrons associated with neutrino interactions. The\nreach of the proton lifetime is further enhanced by introducing new signal\ncriteria that select the decay of a proton in a hydrogen atom. No candidates\nwere seen in the $p \\rightarrow e^{+} \\pi^{0}$ search. Two candidates that\npassed all of the selection criteria for $p \\rightarrow \\mu^{+} \\pi^{0}$ have\nbeen observed, but these are consistent with the expected number of background\nevents of 0.87. Lower limits on the proton lifetime are set at $\\tau/B(p\n\\rightarrow e^{+} \\pi^{0}) > 1.6 \\times 10^{34}$ years and $\\tau/B(p\n\\rightarrow \\mu^{+} \\pi^{0}) > 7.7 \\times 10^{33}$ years at 90% confidence\nlevel.\n", "  We study the spin relaxation of charge carriers in graphene in the presence\nof spin-polarized charged impurities by calculating the time evolution of\ninitially polarized state. The spin relaxation time shows completely different\nenergy behaviour for short-ranged and long-ranged spin scatterers and can be\nused to identify the dominant source of spin scattering. Our results agree well\nwith recent experimental findings and indicate that their spin relaxation is\nlikely caused by long-ranged scatterers.\n", "  We experimentally study a system of quantum kicked rotors - an ensemble of\ndiatomic molecules exposed to a periodic sequence of ultrashort laser pulses.\nIn the regime, where the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic, we\ninvestigate the quantum phenomenon of dynamical localization by means of\nstate-resolved coherent Raman spectroscopy. We examine the dependence of the\nexponentially localized angular momentum distribution and of the total\nrotational energy on the time period between the pulses and their amplitude.\nThe former parameter is shown to provide control over the localization center,\nwhereas the latter one controls the localization length. Similar control of the\ncenter and width of a nonlocalized rotational distribution is demonstrated in\nthe limit of classical diffusion, established by adding noise to the periodic\npulse sequence.\n", "  Blue axion isocurvature perturbations are both theoretically well-motivated\nand interesting from a detectability perspective. These power spectra\ngenerically have a break from the blue region to a flat region. Previous\ninvestigations of the power spectra were analytic, which left a gap in the\npredicted spectrum in the break region due to the non-applicability of the used\nanalytic techniques. We therefore compute the isocurvature spectrum numerically\nfor an explicit supersymmetric axion model. We find a bump that enhances the\nisocurvature signal for this class of scenarios. A fitting function of three\nparameters is constructed that fits the spectrum well for the particular axion\nmodel we study. This fitting function should be useful for blue isocurvature\nsignal hunting in data and making experimental sensitivity forecasts.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) generates symmetric keys between two remote\nparties, and guarantees the keys not accessible to any third party. Wavelength\ndivision multiplexing (WDM) between QKD and classical optical communications by\nsharing the existing fibre optics infrastructure is highly desired in order to\nreduce the cost of QKD applications. However, quantum signals are extremely\nweak and thus easily affected by the spontaneous Raman scattering effect from\nintensive classical light. Here, by means of wavelength selecting and spectral\nand temporal filtering, we realize the multiplexing and long distance\nco-propagation of QKD and Terabit classical coherent optical communication\nsystem up to 80km. The data capacity is two orders of magnitude larger than the\nprevious results. Our demonstration verifies the feasibility of QKD and\nclassical communication to share the resources of backbone fibre links, and\nthus taking the utility of QKD a great step forward.\n", "  A sample of the LAMOST spectra of the early type M0-M3 dwarfs is compared\nwith the Kepler observations. It is found that M dwarfs with strong\nchromospheric emission in $H_{\\alpha}$ have large flare activity in general.\nThe rotational periods derived from the Kepler measurements have close\ncorrelations with the sizes of the flares, the power-law distribution index and\nthe equivalent widths of the $H_{\\alpha}$ emission. A clear trend exists for\nhigher magnetic activities being detected in faster rotating M dwarfs (rotation\nperiods $<$ 20 day).\n", "  We present a detection in pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging\nof a point source consistent with being the progenitor star of the Type IIb\nsupernova (SN IIb) 2016gkg. Post-explosion imaging from the Keck Adaptive\nOptics system was used to perform relative astrometry between the Keck and HST\nimaging. We identify a single point source in the HST images coincident with\nthe SN position to 0.89-sigma. The HST photometry is consistent with the\nprogenitor star being an A0Ia star with T=9500 K and log (L/Lsun)=5.15. We find\nthat the SN 2016gkg progenitor star appears more consistent with binary than\nsingle-star evolutionary models. In addition, early-time light curve data from\nSN 2016gkg revealed a rapid rise in luminosity within ~0.4 days of\nnon-detection limits, consistent with models of the cooling phase after shock\nbreak-out. We use these data to determine an explosion date of 20.15 September\n2016 and progenitor star radius of log (R/Rsun)=2.41, which agrees with\nphotometry from the progenitor star. Our findings are also consistent with\ndetections of other SNe IIb progenitor stars, although more luminous and bluer\nthan most other examples.\n", "  We have determined an improved position for the luminous persistent\nneutron-star low-mass X-ray binary and atoll source GX 9+1 from archival\nChandra X-ray Observatory data. The new position significantly differs from a\npreviously published Chandra position for this source. Based on the revised\nX-ray position we have identified a new near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GX\n9+1 in Ks-band images obtained with the PANIC and FourStar cameras on the\nMagellan Baade Telescope. NIR spectra of this Ks=16.5+-0.1 mag star taken with\nthe FIRE spectrograph on the Baade Telescope show a strong Br-gamma emission\nline, which is a clear signature that we discovered the true NIR counterpart to\nGX 9+1. The mass donor in GX 9+1 cannot be a late-type giant, as such a star\nwould be brighter than the estimated absolute Ks magnitude of the NIR\ncounterpart. The slope of the dereddened NIR spectrum is poorly constrained due\nto uncertainties in the column density N_H and NIR extinction. Considering the\nsource's distance and X-ray luminosity, we argue that N_H likely lies near the\nhigh end of the previously suggested range. If this is indeed the case, the NIR\nspectrum is consistent with thermal emission from a heated accretion disk,\npossibly with a contribution from the secondary. In this respect, GX 9+1 is\nsimilar to other bright atolls and the Z sources whose NIR spectra do not show\nthe slope that is expected for a dominant contribution from optically thin\nsynchrotron emission from the inner regions of a jet.\n", "  We calculate the mean total number of equilibrium points in a system of $N$\nrandom autonomous ODE's introduced by Cugliandolo et al. in 1997 to describe\nnon-relaxational glassy dynamics on the high-dimensional sphere. In doing it we\nsuggest a new approach which allows such a calculation to be done most\nstraightforwardly, and is based on efficiently incorporating the Langrange\nmultiplier into the Kac-Rice framework. Analysing the asymptotic behaviour for\nlarge $N$ we confirm that the phenomenon of 'topology trivialization' revealed\nearlier for other systems holds also in the present framework with\nnonrelaxational dynamics. Namely, by increasing the variance of the random\n'magnetic field' term in dynamical equations we find a 'phase transition' from\nthe exponentially abundant number of equilibria down to just two equilibria.\nClassifying the equilibria in the nontrivial phase by stability remains an open\nproblem.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of cold dust and molecular gas in four\nhigh-luminosity, heavily reddened (A$_{\\rm{V}} \\sim 2.5-6$ mag) Type 1 quasars\nat $z\\sim2.5$ with virial M$_{\\rm{BH}} \\sim 10^{10}$M$_\\odot$, to test whether\ndusty, massive quasars represent the evolutionary link between submillimetre\nbright galaxies (SMGs) and unobscured quasars. All four quasars are detected in\nboth the dust continuum and in the $^{12}$CO(3-2) line. The mean dust mass is\n6$\\times$10$^{8}$M$_\\odot$ assuming a typical high redshift quasar spectral\nenergy distribution (T=41K, $\\beta$=1.95 or T=47K, $\\beta$=1.6). The implied\nstar formation rates are very high - $\\gtrsim$1000 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in all\ncases. Gas masses estimated from the CO line luminosities cover\n$\\sim$1-5$\\times10^{10}$($\\alpha_{\\rm{CO}} / 0.8$)M$_\\odot$ and the gas\ndepletion timescales are very short - $\\sim5-20$Myr. A range of gas-to-dust\nratios is observed in the sample. We resolve the molecular gas in one quasar -\nULASJ2315$+$0143 ($z=2.561$) - which shows a strong velocity gradient over\n$\\sim$20 kpc. The velocity field is consistent with a rotationally supported\ngas disk but other scenarios, e.g. mergers, cannot be ruled out at the current\nresolution of these data. In another quasar - ULASJ1234+0907 ($z=2.503$) - we\ndetected molecular line emission from two millimetre bright galaxies within 200\nkpc of the quasar, suggesting that this quasar resides in a significant\nover-density. The high detection rate of both cold dust and molecular gas in\nthese sources, suggests that reddened quasars could correspond to an early\nphase in massive galaxy formation associated with large gas reservoirs and\nsignificant star formation.\n", "  Prior statistical knowledge of the atmospheric turbulence is essential for\ndesigning, optimizing and evaluating tomographic adaptive optics systems. We\npresent the statistics of the vertical profiles of $C_N^2$ and the outer scale\nat Maunakea estimated using a Slope Detection And Ranging (SLODAR) method from\non-sky telemetry taken by RAVEN, which is a MOAO demonstrator in the Subaru\ntelescope. In our SLODAR method, the profiles are estimated by a fit of the\ntheoretical auto- and cross-correlation of measurements from multiple\nShack-Haltmann wavefront sensors to the observed correlations via the\nnon-linear Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm (LMA), and the analytic derivatives of\nthe spatial phase structure function with respect to its parameters for the LMA\nare also developed. The estimated profile has the median total seeing of\n0.460$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and large $C_N^2$ fraction of the ground layer of 54.3%.\nThe $C_N^2$ profile has a good agreement with the result from literatures,\nexcept for the ground layer. The median value of the outer scale is 25.5m and\nthe outer scale is larger at higher altitudes, and these trends of the outer\nscale are consistent with findings in literatures.\n", "  Four months of quasi-simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations\nwere used to study the variations of the photometric light curve, the evolution\nof the chromospheric activity from the H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines, and the\ndistribution of cool spots from Doppler maps.\n  During our observations one side of the star was more active than the other.\nThe equivalent width of the H$\\alpha$ line from the least active hemisphere\nincreased from ~0.7 {\\AA} at the beginning of the observation to 1.0 {\\AA} at\nthe end. The basal emission of the most active hemisphere remained roughly\nconstant at a H$\\alpha$ EW of ~1.0 {\\AA}. Intense flare activity was observed\nduring the first twenty days, where at least four different events were\ndetected. The line asymmetries of the H$\\alpha$ line suggest that one of the\nflares could have produced a mass ejection with a maximum projected speed of\n$\\mathrm{70\\thinspace km\\thinspace s^{-1}}$. The rotational modulation of the\nV-band photometry showed clear anti-correlation with the chromospheric\nactivity. The difference in brightness between the opposite hemispheres\ndecreased from 0.16 to 0.09 mag in two months. Three spots gradually moving\napart from each other dominated the photospheric Doppler maps. The comparison\nbetween the maps and the H$\\alpha$ line as the star rotates reveals the spatial\ncoexistence of chromospheric H$\\alpha$ emission and photospheric spots.\n  Our results indicate that the active regions of LQ Hya can live for at least\nfour months. The detected changes in the photometric light curve and the\nspectroscopic Doppler images seem to be more a consequence of the spatial\nredistribution of the active regions rather than due to changes in their\nstrength. Only one of the active regions shows significant changes in its\nchromospheric emission.\n", "  We obtain a perturbative solution for rotating charged black holes in\n5-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with a negative cosmological\nconstant. We start from a small undeformed Kerr-AdS solution and use the\nelectric charge as a perturbative parameter to build up black holes with\nequal-magnitude angular momenta up to forth order. These black hole solutions\nare described by three parameters, the charge, horizon radius and horizon\nangular velocity. We determine the physical quantities of these black holes and\nstudy their dependence on the parameters of black holes and arbitrary\nChern-Simons coefficient. In particular, for values of CS coupling constant\nbeyond its supergravity amount, due to a rotational instability,\ncounterrotating black holes arise. Also the rotating solutions appear to have\nvanishing angular momenta and do not manifest uniquely by their global charges.\n", "  Notes for a Course on Probability and Statistics: L1: Elements of\nProbability; L2: Bayesian Inference; L3: Monte Carlo Methods\n", "  Numerical studies of gravitational collapse to black holes make use of\napparent horizons, which are intrinsically foliation-dependent. We expose the\nproblem and discuss possible solutions using the Hawking quasilocal mass. In\nspherical symmetry, we present a physically sensible approach to the problem by\nrestricting to spherically symmetric spacetime slicings. In spherical symmetry\nthe apparent horizons are gauge-independent in any spherically symmetric\nfoliation but physical quantities associated with them, such as surface gravity\nand temperature, are not. The widely used comoving and Kodama foliations, which\nare of particular interest, are discussed in detail.\n", "  We study the dynamics of pedestrian evacuations through a narrow doorway by\nmeans of controlled experiments. The influence of the pedestrians' behaviours\nis investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c\\_s of the\nparticipants, while the others behave politely. Thanks to an original setup\nenabling the re-injection of egressed participants into the room, the analysis\nis conducted in a (macroscopically) quasi-stationary regime. We find that, as\nc\\_s is increased, the flow rate J rises, interpolating between published\nvalues for egresses in normal conditions and measurements for competitive\nevacuations. The dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian\ndensity $\\rho$ at the door, independently of c\\_s , suggests that\nmacroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density, at\nleast in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure. In particular,\nunder these conditions, J grows monotonically with $\\rho$ up to \"close-packing\"\n($\\rho$ $\\approx$ 9 pers/m${}^2$). The flow is then characterised\nmicroscopically. Among other quantities, the time lapses between successive\nescapes, the pedestrians' waiting times in front of the door, and their angles\nof incidence are analysed statistically. In a nutshell, our main results show\nthat the flow is orderly for polite crowds, with narrowly distributed time\nlapses between egresses, while for larger c\\_s the flow gets disorderly and\nvanishing time lapses emerge. For all c\\_s , we find an alternation between\nshort and long time lapses, which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect.\nThe average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy. The\ndisorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed.\n", "  This study presents a catalog of 8107 molecular clouds that covers the entire\nGalactic plane and includes 98% of the $^{12}$CO emission observed within\n$b\\pm5^\\circ$. The catalog was produced using a hierarchical cluster\nidentification method applied to the result of a Gaussian decomposition of the\nDame et al. data. The total H$_2$ mass in the catalog is $1.2\\times10^9\nM_\\odot$, in agreement with previous estimates. We find that 30% of the sight\nlines intersect only a single cloud, with another 25% intersecting only two\nclouds. The most probable cloud size is $R\\sim30$ pc. We find that $M\\propto\nR^{2.2\\pm0.2}$, with no correlation between the cloud surface density,\n$\\Sigma$, and $R$. In contrast with the general idea, we find a rather large\nrange of values of $\\Sigma$, from 2 to $300 M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and a\nsystematic decrease with increasing Galactic radius, $R_{\\rm gal}$. The cloud\nvelocity dispersion and the normalization $\\sigma_0=\\sigma_v/R^{1/2}$ both\ndecrease systematically with $R_{\\rm gal}$. When studied over the whole\nGalactic disk, there is a large dispersion in the line width-size relation, and\na significantly better correlation between $\\sigma_v$ and $\\Sigma\\,R$. The\nnormalization of this correlation is constant to better than a factor of two\nfor $R_{\\rm gal}<20$ kpc. This relation is used to disentangle the ambiguity\nbetween near and far kinematic distances. We report a strong variation of the\nturbulent energy injection rate. In the outer Galaxy it may be maintained by\naccretion through the disk and/or onto the clouds, but neither source can drive\nthe 100 times higher cloud-averaged injection rate in the inner Galaxy.\n", "  Motion of a particle near a horizon of a spherically symmetric black hole is\nshown to possess a universal Lyapunov exponent of a chaos provided by its\nsurface gravity. To probe the horizon, we introduce electromagnetic or scalar\nforce to the particle so that it does not fall into the horizon. There appears\nan unstable maximum of the total potential where the evaluated maximal Lyapunov\nexponent is found to be independent of the external forces and the particle\nmass. The Lyapunov exponent is universally given by the surface gravity of the\nblack hole. Unless there are other sources of a chaos, the Lyapunov exponent is\nsubject to an inequality $\\lambda \\leq 2\\pi T_{\\rm BH}/\\hbar$, which is\nidentical to the bound recently discovered by Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford.\n", "  Extending a previous study of the velocity autocorrelation function (VAF) in\na simulated Lennard-Jones fluid to cover higher-density and lower-temperature\nstates, we show that the recently demonstrated multiexponential expansion\nallows for a full account and understanding of the dynamical processes\nencompassed by a fundamental quantity as the VAF. In particular, besides\nobtaining evidence of a persisting long-time tail, we assign specific and\nunambiguous physical meanings to groups of exponential modes related to the\nlongitudinal and transverse collective dynamics, respectively. We have made\nthis possible by consistently introducing the interpretation of the VAF\nfrequency spectrum as a global density of states in fluids, generalizing a\nsolid-state concept, and by giving to specific spectral components, obtained\nvia the VAF exponential expansion, the corresponding meaning of partial\ndensities of states relative to specific dynamical processes. The clear\nidentification of a high-frequency oscillation of the VAF with the near-top\nexcitation frequency in the dispersion curve of acoustic waves is a neat\nexample of the power of the method. As for the transverse mode contribution,\nits analysis turns out to be particularly important, because the\nmultiexponential expansion reveals a transition marking the onset of\npropagating excitations when the density is increased above a threshold value.\nWhile this finding agrees with recent literature debating the issue of\ndynamical crossover boundaries, such as the one identified with the Frenkel\nline, we can add detailed information on the modes involved in this specific\nprocess in the domains of both time and frequency. This will help obtain a\nstill missing full account of transverse dynamics, in its nonpropagating and\npropagating aspects which are linked by dynamical transitions depending on both\nthe thermodynamic states and the excitation wavevectors.\n", "  A study of the near-side ridge phenomenon in hadron-hadron collisions based\non a cluster picture of multiparticle production is presented. The near-side\nridge effect is shown to have a natural explanation in this context provided\nthat clusters are produced in a correlated manner in the collision transverse\nplane.\n", "  First principles calculations based on many-electron perturbation theory\nmethods, such as the \\textit{ab initio} GW and GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation\n(GW-BSE) approach, are reliable ways to predict quasiparticle and optical\nproperties of materials, respectively. However, these methods involve more care\nin treating the electron-electron interaction and are considerably more\ncomputationally demanding when applied to systems with reduced dimensionality,\nsince the electronic confinement leads a slower convergence of sums over the\nBrillouin zone due to a much more complicated screening environment that\nmanifests in the \"head\" and \"neck\" elements of the dielectric matrix. Here, we\npresent two new schemes to sample the Brillouin zone for GW and GW-BSE\ncalculations: the non-uniform neck subsampling method and the clustered\nsampling interpolation method, which can respectively be used for a family of\nsingle-particle problems, such as GW calculations, and for problems involving\nthe scattering of two-particle states, such as when solving the BSE. We tested\nthese methods on several few-layer semiconductors and graphene and show that\nthey perform a much more efficient sampling of the Brillouin zone and yield two\nto three orders of magnitude reduction in the computer time. These two methods\ncan be readily incorporated into several \\textit{ab initio} packages that\ncompute electronic and optical properties through the GW and GW-BSE approaches.\n", "  Recent experiments performed in current-driven nano-contacts with strong\nperpendicular anisotropy have shown that spin-transfer torque can drive\nself-localized spin waves [1, 2] that above a certain threshold intensity can\ncondense into a highly nonlinear magnetodynamic and nano-sized state known as a\nmagnetic droplet soliton [3]. Here we demonstrate analytically, numerically,\nand experimentally that at sufficiently large driving currents, and for a spin\npolarization that is tilted away from the film normal, the circular droplet\nsoliton can become unstable to periodic excitations of its perimeter. We\nfurthermore show that these perimeter excitation modes (PEMs) are\nparametrically excited when the fundamental droplet soliton precession\nfrequency is close to twice the frequency of one or more of the PEMs. As a\nconsequence, for increasing applied fields, progressively higher PEMs can be\nexcited. Quantitative agreement with experiment confirms this picture.\n", "  We present a method that extends the capabilities of the PINpointing\nOrbit-Crossing Collapsed HIerarchical Objects (PINOCCHIO) code, allowing it to\ngenerate accurate dark matter halo mock catalogues in cosmological models where\nthe linear growth factor and the growth rate depend on scale. Such cosmologies\ncomprise, among others, models with massive neutrinos and some classes of\nmodified gravity theories. We validate the code by comparing the halo\nproperties from PINOCCHIO against N-body simulations, focusing on cosmologies\nwith massive neutrinos: $\\nu\\Lambda$CDM. We analyse the halo mass function,\nhalo two-point correlation function, halo power spectrum and the moments of the\nhalo density field, showing that PINOCCHIO reproduces the results from\nsimulations with the same level of precision as the original code\n($\\sim5-10\\%$). We demonstrate that the abundance of halos in cosmologies with\nmassless and massive neutrinos from PINOCCHIO matches very well the outcome of\nsimulations, and point out that PINOCCHIO can reproduce the\n$\\Omega_\\nu-\\sigma_8$ degeneracy that affects the halo mass function. We show\nthat the clustering properties of the halos from PINOCCHIO matches accurately\nthose from simulations both in real and redshift-space, in the latter case up\nto $k=0.3~h~{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We finally point out that the first moments of the\nhalo density field from simulations are precisely reproduced by PINOCCHIO. We\nemphasize that the computational time required by PINOCCHIO to generate mock\nhalo catalogues is orders of magnitude lower than the one needed for N-body\nsimulations. This makes this tool ideal for applications like covariance matrix\nstudies within the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model but also in cosmologies with\nmassive neutrinos or some modified gravity theories.\n", "  We present the results of 2-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nself-gravitating circumbinary discs around binaries whose parameters match\nthose of the circumbinary planet-hosting systems Kepler-16, -34 and -35.\nPrevious work has shown that non-self-gravitating discs in these systems form\nan eccentric precessing inner cavity due to tidal truncation by the binary, and\nplanets which form at large radii migrate until stalling at this cavity. While\nthis scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital\nlocations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to\nmatch the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work is to\nexamine the role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a\nfunction of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded\ncircumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc\nmasses between 1--5 times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc\nself-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of\ncircumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two\ndramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity\nshrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in\naddition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric\nring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs. If planet\nformation starts early in the disc lifetime, these changes will have a\nsignificant impact on the formation and evolution of planets and precursor\nmaterial.\n", "  Orbital optimization procedure is widely called in electronic structure\nsimulation. To efficiently find the orbital optimization solution, we developed\na new second order orbital optimization algorithm, co-iteration augmented\nHessian (CIAH) method. In this method, the orbital optimization is embedded in\nthe diagonalization procedure for augmented Hessian (AH) eigenvalue equation.\nApproximations for Hessian matrix can be easily employed in this method to\nimprove the computational costs. We numerically performed the CIAH algorithm\nwith SCF convergence of 20 challenging systems and Boys localization of C60\nmolecule. We found that CIAH algorithm has better SCF convergence and less\ncomputational costs than direct inversion iterative subspace (DIIS) algorithm.\nThe numerical tests suggest that CIAH is a stable, reliable and efficient\nalgorithm for orbital optimization problem.\n", "  We study seven-branes in $O(10^{15})$ four-dimensional F-theory\ncompactifications where seven-brane moduli must be tuned in order to achieve\nnon-abelian gauge symmetry. The associated compact spaces $B$ are the set of\nall smooth weak Fano toric threefolds. By a study of fine star regular\ntriangulations of three dimensional reflexive polytopes, the number of such\nspaces is estimated to be $5.8\\times 10^{14}\\lesssim N_\\text{bases}\\lesssim\n1.8\\times 10^{17}$. Typically hundreds or thousands of moduli must be tuned to\nachieve symmetry for $h^{11}(B)<10$, but the average number drops sharply into\nthe range $O(25)$-$O(200)$ as $h^{11}(B)$ increases. For some low rank groups,\nsuch as $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$, there exist examples where only a few moduli must\nbe tuned in order to achieve seven-brane gauge symmetry.\n", "  The vector-tensor (VT) theory of gravitation revisited in this article was\nstudied in previous papers, where it was proved that VT works and deserves\nattention. New observational data and numerical codes have motivated further\ndevelopment which is presented here. New research has been planed with the\nessential aim of proving that current cosmological observations, including\nPlanck data, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and so on, may be explained\nwith VT, a theory which accounts for a kind of dark energy which has the same\nequation of state as vacuum. New versions of the codes CAMB and COSMOMC have\nbeen designed for applications to VT, and the resulting versions have been used\nto get the cosmological parameters of the VT model at suitable confidence\nlevels. The parameters to be estimated are the same as ingeneral relativity\n(GR), plus a new parameter $D$. For $D=0$, VT linear cosmological perturbations\nreduces to those of GR, but the VT background may explain dark energy. The fits\nbetween observations and VT predictions lead to non vanishing $|D|$ upper\nlimits at the $1\\sigma $ confidence level. The value $D=0$ is admissible at\nthis level, but this value is not that of the best fit in any case. Results\nstrongly suggest that VT may explain current observations, at least, as well as\nGR; with the advantage that, as it is proved in this paper, VT has an\nadditional parameter which facilitates adjustments to current observational\ndata.}\n", "  We study a three-body system, formed by a light particle and two identical\nheavy dipoles, in two dimensions in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We\npresent the analytic light-particle wave function resulting from an attractive\nzero-range potential between the light and each of the heavy particles. It\nexpresses the large-distance universal properties which must be reproduced by\nall realistic short-range interactions. We calculate the three-body spectrum\nfor zero heavy-heavy interaction as a function of light to heavy mass ratio. We\ndiscuss the relatively small deviations from Coulomb estimates and the\ndegeneracies related to radial nodes and angular momentum quantum numbers. We\ninclude a repulsive dipole-dipole interaction and investigate the three-body\nsolutions as functions of strength and dipole direction. Avoided crossings\noccur between levels localized in the emerging small and large-distance minima,\nrespectively. The characteristic exchange of properties such as mean square\nradii are calculated. Simulation of quantum information transfer is suggested.\nFor large heavy-heavy particle repulsion all bound states have disappeared into\nthe continuum. The corresponding critical strength is inversely proportional to\nthe square of the mass ratio, far from the linear dependence from the Landau\ncriterion.\n", "  The boundary Weyl anomalies live on a codimension-1 boundary, $\\partial {\\cal\nM}$. The entanglement entropy originates from infinite correlations on both\nsides of a codimension-2 surface, $\\Sigma$. Motivated to have a further\nunderstanding of the boundary effects, we introduce a notion of reduction\nentropy, which, guided by thermodynamics, is a combination of the boundary\neffective action and the boundary stress tensor defined by allowing the metric\non $\\partial {\\cal M}$ to fluctuate. We discuss how a reduction might be\nperformed so that the reduction entropy reproduces the entanglement structure.\n", "  The \"torus\" obscurer of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is poorly understood in\nterms of its density, substructure and physical mechanisms. Large X-ray surveys\nprovide model boundary constraints, for both Compton-thin and Compton-thick\nlevels of obscuration, as obscured fractions are mean covering factors\n$f_{\\text{cov}}$. However, a major remaining uncertainty is host galaxy\nobscuration. In Paper I we discovered a relation of $N_H \\propto\nM_{\\star}^{1/3}$ for the obscuration of galaxy-scale gas. Here we apply this\nobservational relation to the AGN population, and find that galaxy-scale gas is\nresponsible for a luminosity-independent fraction of Compton-thin AGN, but does\nnot produce Compton-thick columns. With the host galaxy obscuration understood,\nwe present a model of the remaining, nuclear obscurer which is consistent with\na range of observations. Our radiation-lifted torus model consists of a\nCompton-thick component ($f_{\\text{cov}}\\sim35\\%$) and a Compton-thin component\n($f_{\\text{cov}}\\sim40\\%$), which depends on both black hole mass and\nluminosity. This provides a useful summary of observational constraints for\ntorus modellers who attempt to reproduce this behaviour. It can also be\nemployed as a sub-grid recipe in cosmological simulations which do not resolve\nthe torus. We also investigate host-galaxy X-ray obscuration inside\ncosmological, hydro-dynamic simulations (EAGLE, Illustris). The obscuration\nfrom ray-traced galaxy gas can agree with observations, but is highly sensitive\nto the chosen feedback assumptions.\n", "  Previous studies have found that ~1 deg2 fields surrounding the stellar\naggregates in the Taurus star-forming region exhibit a surplus of solar-mass\nstars relative to denser clusters like IC~348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. To\ntest whether this difference reflects mass segregation in Taurus or a variation\nin the IMF, we have performed a survey for members of Taurus across a large\nfield (~40 deg2) that was imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We\nobtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members identified with\nthose images and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, as well as miscellaneous\ncandidates that were selected with several other diagnostics of membership. We\nhave classified 22 of the candidates as new members of Taurus, which includes\none of the coolest known members (M9.75). Our updated census of members within\nthe SDSS field shows a surplus of solar-mass stars relative to clusters,\nalthough it is less pronounced than in the smaller fields towards the stellar\naggregates that were surveyed for previously measured mass functions in Taurus.\nIn addition to spectra of our new members, we include in our study near-IR\nspectra of roughly half of the known members of Taurus, which are used to\nrefine their spectral types and extinctions. We also present an updated set of\nnear-IR standard spectra for classifying young stars and brown dwarfs at M and\nL types.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that in gyrotropic semiconductors and\nsemiconductor nanosystems the Brownian motion of electrons results in temporal\nfluctuations of the polarization plane of light passing through or reflected\nfrom the structure, i.e., in stochastic Faraday or Kerr rotation effects. The\ntheory of the effects is developed for a number of prominent gyrotropic systems\nsuch as bulk tellurium, ensembles of chiral carbon nanotubes, and GaAs-based\nquantum wells of different crystallographic orientations. We show that the\npower spectrum of these fluctuations in thermal equilibrium is proportional to\nthe ac conductivity of the system. We evaluate contributions resulting from the\nfluctuations of the electric current, as well as of spin, valley polarization,\nand the spin current to the noise of the Faraday/Kerr rotation. Hence,\nall-optical measurements of the Faraday and Kerr rotation noise provide an\naccess to the transport properties of the semiconductor systems.\n", "  We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet (FUV and NUV) maps of M31,\nboth with and without dust reddening. These maps were constructed from\nspatially-resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic\nHubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling\nto generate synthetic UV maps with projected spatial resolution of $\\sim$100 pc\n($\\sim$24 arcseconds) The predicted UV flux agrees well with the observed flux,\nwith median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of\n$\\log_{10}(f^{syn}/f^{obs}) = 0.03\\pm0.24$ and $-0.03\\pm0.16$ in the FUV and\nNUV, respectively. This agreement is particularly impressive given that we used\nonly optical photometry to construct these UV maps. We use the dust-free maps\nto examine properties of obscured flux and star formation by comparing our\nreddened and dust-free FUV flux maps with the observed FUV and FUV+24{\\mu}m\nflux to examine the fraction of obscured flux. The synthetic flux maps require\nthat $\\sim$90% of the FUV flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the\nGALEX-based methods suggest that $\\sim$70% of the flux is obscured. This\nincrease in the obscured flux estimate is driven by significant differences\nbetween the dust-free synthetic FUV flux and that derived when correcting the\nobserved FUV for dust with 24{\\mu}m observations. The difference is further\nillustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the FUV+24{\\mu}m flux with\nthe 100 Myr average SFR from the SFHs. The 24{\\mu}m-corrected FUV flux\nunderestimates the SFR by a factor of $\\sim$2.3 - 2.5. [abridged]\n", "  We present three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of the\nself-gravitating interstellar medium (ISM) in a periodic (256 pc)$^3$ box with\na mean number density of 0.5 cm$^{-3}$. At a fixed supernova rate we\ninvestigate the multi-phase ISM structure, H$_{2}$ molecule formation and\ndensity-magnetic field scaling for varying initial magnetic field strengths (0,\n$6\\times 10^{-3}$, 0.3, 3 $\\mu$G). All magnetic runs saturate at mass weighted\nfield strengths of $\\sim$ 1 $-$ 3 $\\mu$G but the ISM structure is notably\ndifferent. With increasing initial field strengths (from $6\\times 10^{-3}$ to 3\n$\\mu$G) the simulations develop an ISM with a more homogeneous density and\ntemperature structure, with increasing mass (from 5% to 85%) and volume filling\nfractions (from 4% to 85%) of warm (300 K $<$ T $<$ 8000 K) gas, with\ndecreasing volume filling fractions (VFF) from $\\sim$ 35% to $\\sim$ 12% of hot\ngas (T $> 10^5$ K) and with a decreasing H$_{2}$ mass fraction (from 70% to $<$\n1%). Meanwhile the mass fraction of gas in which the magnetic pressure\ndominates over the thermal pressure increases by a factor of 10, from 0.07 for\nan initial field of $6\\times 10^{-3}$ $\\mu$G to 0.7 for a 3 $\\mu$G initial\nfield. In all but the simulations with the highest initial field strength\nself-gravity promotes the formation of dense gas and H$_{2}$, but does not\nchange any other trends. We conclude that magnetic fields have a significant\nimpact on the multi-phase, chemical and thermal structure of the ISM and\ndiscuss potential implications and limitations of the model.\n", "  We present the prototype telescope for the Next Generation Transit Survey,\nwhich was built in the UK in 2008/09 and tested on La Palma in the Canary\nIslands in 2010. The goals for the prototype system were severalfold: to\ndetermine the level of systematic noise in an NGTS-like system; demonstrate\nthat we can perform photometry at the (sub) millimagnitude level on transit\ntimescales across a wide field; show that it is possible to detect transiting\nsuper-Earth and Neptune-sized exoplanets and prove the technical feasibility of\nthe proposed planet survey. We tested the system for around 100 nights and met\neach of the goals above. Several key areas for improvement were highlighted\nduring the prototyping phase. They have been subsequently addressed in the\nfinal NGTS facility which was recently commissioned at ESO Cerro Paranal,\nChile.\n", "  Understanding the nature and evolution of the photospheric helicity flux\ntransfer is a key to reveal the role of magnetic helicity in coronal dynamics\nof solar active regions. Using SDO/HMI photospheric vector magnetograms and the\nderived flow velocity field, we computed boundary driven helicity flux with a\n12 minute cadence during the emergence of AR 11928. Accounting the foot point\nconnectivity defined by non-linear force-free magnetic extrapolations, we\nderived and analyzed the corrected distribution of helicity flux maps. The\nphotospheric helicity flux injection is found to changes sign during the steady\nemergence of the AR. This reversal is confirmed with the evolution of the\nphotospheric electric currents and with the coronal connectivity as observed in\nEUV wavelengths with SDO/AIA. During about the three first days of emergence,\nthe AR coronal helicity is positive while later on the field configuration is\nclose to a potential field. As theoretically expected, the magnetic helicity\ncancelation is associated to enhanced coronal activity. The study suggests a\nboundary driven transformation of the chirality in the global AR magnetic\nstructure. This may be the result of the emergence of a flux rope with positive\ntwist around its apex while it has negative twist in its legs. The origin of\nsuch mixed helicity flux rope in the convective zone is challenging for models.\n", "  In this paper, we examined a possibility of preservation of a substantially\nmultimode radiation in a single cell of quantum memory. As a light source we\nconsidered a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO). As it\nwas shown in [1-4], SPOPO radiation has a large number of the correlated modes\nmaking it attractive for the purposes of the quantum communication and\ncomputing. We showed that these correlations can be mapped on the longitudinal\nspin waves of the memory cell and be restored later in the readout light. The\nefficiencies of the writing and readout depend on the mode structure of the\nmemory determined by a mechanism of the light-matter interaction under\nconsideration (the non-resonance Raman interaction) and by the profile of the\ndriving light field. We showed that like the initial light pulse train, the\nrestored one can be represented by a set of squeezed supermodes. The mapping of\nthe quantum multimode correlations on the material medium offers opportunities\nto manipulate the quantum states within the memory cell followed by the reading\nof the transformed state.\n", "  Using the Boolardy Engineering Test Array of the Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder (ASKAP BETA), we have carried out the first $z = 0 - 1$ survey\nfor HI and OH absorption towards the gravitationally lensed quasars\nPKSB1830$-$211 and MGJ0414$+$0534. Although we detected all previously reported\nintervening systems towards PKSB1830$-$211, in the case of MGJ0414+0534 three\nsystems were not found, indicating that the original identifications may have\nbeen confused with radio frequency interference. Given the sensitivity of our\ndata, we find that our detection yield is consistent with the expected\nfrequency of intervening HI systems estimated from previous surveys for 21-cm\nemission in nearby galaxies and $z \\sim 3$ damped Lyman $\\alpha$ absorbers. We\nfind spectral variability in the $z = 0.886$ face-on spiral galaxy towards\nPKSB1830$-$211, from observations undertaken with the Westerbork Synthesis\nRadio Telescope in 1997/1998 and ASKAP BETA in 2014/2015. The HI equivalent\nwidth varies by a few per cent over approximately yearly time-scales. This\nlong-term spectral variability is correlated between the north-east and\nsouth-west images of the core, and with the total flux density of the source,\nimplying that it is observationally coupled to intrinsic changes in the quasar.\nThe absence of any detectable variability in the ratio of HI associated with\nthe two core images is in stark contrast to the behaviour previously seen in\nthe molecular lines. We therefore infer that coherent opaque HI structures in\nthis galaxy are larger than the parsec-scale molecular clouds found at\nmm-wavelengths.\n", "  Aims. We probe the physical conditions in the core of Arp 299A and try to put\nconstraints to the nature of its nuclear power source. Methods. We used\nHerschel Space Observatory far-infrared and submillimeter observations of H2O\nand OH rotational lines in Arp 299A to create a multi-component model of the\ngalaxy. In doing this, we employed a spherically symmetric radiative transfer\ncode. Results. Nine H2O lines in absorption and eight in emission as well as\nfour OH doublets in absorption and one in emission, are detected in Arp 299A.\nNo lines of the 18O isotopologues, which have been seen in compact obscured\nnuclei of other galaxies, are detected. The absorption in the ground state OH\ndoublet at 119 {\\mu}m is found redshifted by ~175 km/s compared to other OH and\nH2O lines, suggesting a low excitation inflow. We find that at least two\ncomponents are required in order to account for the excited molecular line\nspectrum. The inner component has a radius of 20-25 pc, a very high infrared\nsurface brightness (> 3e13 Lsun/kpc^2), warm dust (Td > 90 K), and a large H2\ncolumn density (NH2 > 1e24 cm^-2). The outer component is larger (50-100 pc)\nwith slightly cooler dust (70-90 K). In addition, a much more extended\ninflowing component is required to also account for the OH doublet at 119\n{\\mu}m. Conclusions. The Compton-thick nature of the core makes it difficult to\ndetermine the nature of the buried power source, but the high surface\nbrightness indicates that it is either an active galactic nucleus and/or a\ndense nuclear starburst. The high OH/H2O ratio in the nucleus indicates that\nion-neutral chemistry induced by X-rays or cosmic-rays is important. Finally we\nfind a lower limit to the 16O/18O ratio of 400 in the nuclear region, possibly\nindicating that the nuclear starburst is in an early evolutionary stage, or\nthat it is fed through a molecular inflow of, at most, solar metallicity.\n", "  The nature versus nurture scenario in galaxy and group evolution is a\nlong-standing problem not yet fully understood on cosmological scales. We study\nthe properties of groups and their central galaxies in different large-scale\nenvironments defined by the luminosity density field and the cosmic web\nfilaments. We use the luminosity density field constructed using 8 Mpc/h\nsmoothing to characterize the large-scale environments and the Bisous model to\nextract the filamentary structures in different large-scale environments. We\nfind differences in the properties of central galaxies and their groups in and\noutside of filaments at fixed halo and large-scale environments. In\nhigh-density environments, the group mass function has higher number densities\nin filaments compared to that outside of filaments towards the massive end. The\nrelation is opposite in low-density environments. At fixed group mass and\nlarge-scale luminosity density, groups in filaments are slightly more luminous\nand their central galaxies have redder colors, higher stellar masses, and lower\nspecific star formation rates than those outside of filaments. However, the\ndifferences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments\nare not clear in some group mass bins. We show that the differences in central\ngalaxy properties are due to the higher abundances of elliptical galaxies in\nfilaments. Filamentary structures in the cosmic web are not simply visual\nassociations of galaxies, but rather play an important role in shaping the\nproperties of groups and their central galaxies. The differences in central\ngalaxy and group properties in and outside of cosmic web filaments are not\nsimple effects related to large-scale environmental density. The results point\ntowards an efficient mechanism in cosmic web filaments which quench star\nformation and transform central galaxy morphology from late to early types.\n", "  The well known black hole candidate H~1743-322 exhibited temporal and\nspectral variabilities during several outbursts. Daily variation of the\naccretion rates and the flow geometry change on a daily basis during each of\nthe outbursts could be understood very well using the recent implementation of\ntwo component advective flow (TCAF) solution of the viscous transonic flow\nequations as an additive table model in XSPEC. This has dramatically improved\nour understanding about the accretion flow dynamics. Most interestingly, the\nsolution allows to treat mass of the black hole candidate as a free parameter\nand there mass could be estimated from spectral fits. In this paper, we fit the\ndata of two successive outbursts of H~1743-322 in 2010 and 2011 and studied\nevolutions of accretion flow parameters, such as, two component (Keplerian and\nsub-Keplerian) accretion rates, shock location (i.e., size of the Compton\ncloud), etc. We assume that the model Normalization remains the same accross\nthe states in both these outbursts. We use this to estimate mass of the black\nhole and found that it comes out in the range of $9.25-12.86 M_\\odot$. For the\nsake of comparison, we also estimated mass using Photon index vs. QPO frequency\ncorrelation method which turns out to be $11.65 \\pm 0.67 M_\\odot$ using GRO\nJ1655-40 as reference source. Combining these two estimates, the most probable\nmass of the compact object becomes $11.21^{+1.65}_{-1.96} M_\\odot$.\n", "  Mergers of galaxy clusters are among the most energetic events in the\nUniverse. These events have significant impact on the intra-cluster medium,\ndepositing vast amounts of energy - often in the form of shocks - as well as\nheavily influencing the properties of the constituent galaxy population. Many\nclusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known\nvariously as radio haloes and relics. These sources arise as a result of\nelectron (re-)acceleration in cluster-scale magnetic fields, although the\nprocesses by which this occurs are still poorly understood. We present new,\ndeep radio observations of the high-redshift galaxy cluster MACS\nJ0025.4$-$1222, taken with the GMRT at 325 MHz, as well as new analysis of all\narchival $Chandra$ X-ray observations. We aim to investigate the potential of\ndiffuse radio emission and categorise the radio population of this cluster,\nwhich has only been covered previously by shallow radio surveys. We produce\nlow-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4$-$1222 through a combination of uv-tapering\nand subtracting the compact source population. Radial surface brightness and\nmass profiles are derived from the $Chandra$ data. We also derive a 2D map of\nthe ICM temperature. For the first time, two sources of diffuse radio emission\nare detected in MACS J0025.4$-$1222, on linear scales of several hundred kpc.\nGiven the redshift of the cluster and the assumed cosmology, these sources\nappear to be consistent with established trends in power scaling relations for\nradio relics. The X-ray temperature map presents evidence of an asymmetric\ntemperature profile and tentative identification of a temperature jump\nassociated with one relic. We classify the pair of diffuse radio sources in\nthis cluster as a pair of radio relics, given their consistency with scaling\nrelations, location toward the cluster outskirts, and the available X-ray data.\n", "  We present the first time abundance analysis of a very metal-poor\ncarbon-enhanced star CD-27 14351 based on a high resolution (R ~ 48000) FEROS\nspectrum. Our abundance analysis performed using Local Thermodynamic\nEquilibrium (LTE) model atmospheres shows that the object is a cool star with\nstellar atmospheric parameters, effective temperature Teff = 4335 K, surface\ngravity log g = 0.5, microturbulence = 2.42 km/s, and, metallicity [Fe/H] =\n-2.6. The star exhibits high carbon and nitrogen abundances with [C/Fe] = 2.89\nand [N/Fe] = 1.89. Overabundances of neutron-capture elements are evident in\nBa, La, Ce, and Nd with estimated [X/Fe] > 1, the largest enhancement being\nseen in Ce with [Ce/Fe] = 2.63. While the first peak s-process elements Sr and\nY are found to be enhanced with respect to Fe, ([Sr/Fe] = 1.73 and [Y/Fe] =\n1.91) the third peak s-process element Pb could not be detected in our spectrum\nat the given resolution. Europium, primarily a r-process element also shows an\nenhancement with [Eu/Fe] = 1.65. With [Ba/Eu] = 0.12 the object CD-27 14351\nsatisfies the classification criterion for CEMP-r/s star. The elemental\nabundance distributions observed in this star is discussed in light of chemical\nabundances observed in other CEMP stars from literature.\n", "  We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting the star GJ 536 based on\nthe analysis of the radial-velocity time series from the HARPS and HARPS-N\nspectrographs. GJ 536 b is a planet with a minimum mass M sin $i$ of 5.36 +-\n0.69 Me with an orbital period of 8.7076 +- 0.0025 days at a distance of\n0.066610(13) AU, and an orbit that is consistent with circular. The host star\nis the moderately quiet M1 V star GJ 536, located at 10 pc from the Sun. We\nfind the presence of a second signal at 43 days that we relate to stellar\nrotation after analysing the time series of Ca II H&K and H alpha spectroscopic\nindicators and photometric data from the ASAS archive. We find no evidence\nlinking the short period signal to any activity proxy. We also tentatively\nderived a stellar magnetic cycle of less than 3 years.\n", "  Diffuse gamma-ray emission from interstellar clouds results largely from\ncosmic ray (CR) proton collisions with ambient gas, regardless of the gas\nstate, temperature, or dust properties of the cloud. The interstellar medium is\npredominantly transparent to both CRs and gamma-rays, so GeV emission is a\nunique probe of the total gas column density. The gamma-ray emissivity of a\ncloud of known column density is then a measure of the impinging CR population\nand may be used to map the kpc-scale CR distribution in the Galaxy. To this\nend, we test a number of commonly used column density tracers to evaluate their\neffectiveness in modeling the GeV emission from the relatively quiescent,\nnearby $\\rho$ Ophiuchi molecular cloud. We confirm that both \\hi\\ and an\nappropriate H$_2$ tracer are required to reproduce the total gas column\ndensities probed by diffuse gamma-ray emisison. We find that the optical depth\nat 353 GHz $\\tau_{353}$ from Planck reproduces the gamma-ray data best overall\nbased on the test statistic across the entire region of interest, but near\ninfrared stellar extinction also performs very well, with smaller spatial\nresiduals in the densest parts of the cloud.\n", "  We report on FORS2 optical spectroscopy of the black hole X-ray binary V404\nCygni, performed at the very beginning of its 2015 outburst decay, complemented\nby quasi-simultaneous $Swift$ X-ray and ultra-violet as well as REM\nnear-infrared observations. Its peculiar spectrum is dominated by a wealth of\nemission signatures of HI, HeI, and higher ionisation species, in particular\nFeII. The spectral features are divided between broad red-shifted and narrow\nstationary varieties, the latter being emitted in the outer regions. Continuum\nand line variability at short time scale is high and we find Baldwin\neffect-like anti-correlations between the full-widths at half-maximum and\nequivalent widths of the broad lines with their local continua. The Balmer\ndecrement H{\\alpha}/H{\\beta} is also abnormally large at $4.61\\pm0.62$. We\nargue that these properties hint at the broad lines being optically thick and\narising within a circumbinary component in which shocks between faster\noptically thick and slower optically thin regions may occur. We associate it to\na nova-like nebula formed by the cooling remnant of strong accretion disc winds\nthat turned off when the mass-accretion rate dropped following the last major\nflare. The FeII lines likely arise from the overlap region between this nebula\nand the companion star winds, whereas we favour the shocks within the nebula as\nresponsible for the optical continuum via self-absorbed optically thin\nbremsstrahlung. The presence of a near-infrared excess also points towards the\ncontribution of a strongly variable compact jet or a dusty component.\n", "  Localization estimates for GW150914, the first binary black hole detected by\nthe LIGO instruments, were shared with partner facilities for electromagnetic\nfollow-up. While the source was a compact binary coalescence (CBC), it was\nfirst identified by algorithms that search for unmodeled signals, which\nproduced the skymaps that directed electromagnetic observations. Later on, CBC\nspecific algorithms produced refined versions, which showed significant\ndifferences. In this paper we show that those differences were not accidental\nand that CBC and unmodeled skymaps for binary black holes will frequently be\ndifferent; we thus provide a way to determine whether to observe\nelectromagnetically as promptly as possible (following a gravitational-wave\ndetection), or to wait until CBC skymaps become available, should they not be\navailable in low latency. We also show that, unsurprisingly, CBC algorithms can\nyield much smaller searched areas.\n", "  Astronomical data does not always use Cartesian coordinates. Both all-sky\nobservational data and simulations of rotationally symmetric systems, such as\naccretion and protoplanetary discs, may use spherical polar or other coordinate\nsystems. Standard displays rely on Cartesian coordinates, but converting\nnon-Cartesian data into Cartesian format causes distortion of the data and loss\nof detail. I here demonstrate a method using standard techniques from computer\ngraphics that avoids these problems with 3D data in arbitrary coordinate\nsystems. The method adds minimum computational cost to the display process and\nis suitable for both realtime, interactive content and producing fixed rendered\nimages and videos. Proof-of-concept code is provided which works for data in\nspherical polar coordinates.\n", "  The observed disparity between the radial dependence of the ion and electron\ndensities measured by the Cassini plasma and radio science instruments are used\nto show that the region between the outer edge of Saturn's main rings and its\ntenuous G-ring is permeated with small charged grains (nanograins). These\ngrains emanate from the edge of the A-ring and from the tenuous F-ring and\nG-ring. This is a region of Saturn's magnetosphere that is relatively\nunexplored, but will be a focus of Cassini's F-ring orbits prior to the end of\nmission in September 2017. Confirmation of the grain densities predicted here\nwill enhance our ability to describe the formation and destruction of material\nin this important region of Saturn's magnetosphere.\n", "  We perform the first spatially-resolved stellar population study of galaxies\nin the early universe (z = 3.5 - 6.5), utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope\nCosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS)\nimaging dataset over the GOODS-S field. We select a sample of 418 bright and\nextended galaxies at z = 3.5 - 6.5 from a parent sample of ~ 8000\nphotometric-redshift selected galaxies from Finkelstein et al. (2015). We first\nexamine galaxies at 3.5< z < 4.0 using additional deep K-band survey data from\nthe HAWK-I UDS and GOODS Survey (HUGS) which covers the 4000A break at these\nredshifts. We measure the stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust\nextinction for galaxy inner and outer regions via spatially-resolved spectral\nenergy distribution fitting based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. By\ncomparing specific star formation rates (sSFRs) between inner and outer parts\nof the galaxies we find that the majority of galaxies with the high central\nmass densities show evidence for a preferentially lower sSFR in their centers\nthan in their outer regions, indicative of reduced sSFRs in their central\nregions. We also study galaxies at z ~ 5 and 6 (here limited to high spatial\nresolution in the rest-frame ultraviolet only), finding that they show sSFRs\nwhich are generally independent of radial distance from the center of the\ngalaxies. This indicates that stars are formed uniformly at all radii in\nmassive galaxies at z ~ 5 - 6, contrary to massive galaxies at z < 4.\n", "  We present abundances of globular clusters in the Milky Way and Fornax from\nintegrated light spectra. Our goal is to evaluate the consistency of the\nintegrated light analysis relative to standard abundance analysis for\nindividual stars in those same clusters. This sample includes an updated\nanalysis of 7 clusters from our previous publications and results for 5 new\nclusters that expand the metallicity range over which our technique has been\ntested. We find that the [Fe/H] measured from integrated light spectra agrees\nto $\\sim$0.1 dex for globular clusters with metallicities as high as\n[Fe/H]=$-0.3$, but the abundances measured for more metal rich clusters may be\nunderestimated. In addition we systematically evaluate the accuracy of\nabundance ratios, [X/Fe], for Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II,\nV I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I, Cu I, Y II, Zr I, Ba II, La II, Nd II, and Eu II.\nThe elements for which the integrated light analysis gives results that are\nmost similar to analysis of individual stellar spectra are Fe I, Ca I, Si I, Ni\nI, and Ba II. The elements that show the greatest differences include Mg I and\nZr I. Some elements show good agreement only over a limited range in\nmetallicity. More stellar abundance data in these clusters would enable more\ncomplete evaluation of the integrated light results for other important\nelements.\n", "  We investigate the large-scale transport of inertial particles. We derive\nexplicit analytic expressions for the eddy diffusivities for generic Stokes\ntimes. These latter expressions are exact for any shear flow while they\ncorrespond to the leading contribution either in the deviation from the shear\nflow geometry or in the P\\'eclet number of general random Gaussian velocity\nfields. Our explicit expressions allow us to investigate the role of inertia\nfor such a class of flows and to make exact links with the analogous transport\nproblem for tracer particles.\n", "  In this paper, we present the analysis of the binary gravitational\nmicrolensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-0196. The event lasted for almost a year and\nthe light curve exhibited significant deviations from the lensing model based\non the rectilinear lens-source relative motion, enabling us to measure the\nmicrolens parallax. The ground-based microlens parallax is confirmed by the\ndata obtained from space-based microlens observations using the {\\it Spitzer}\ntelescope. By additionally measuring the angular Einstein radius from the\nanalysis of the resolved caustic crossing, the physical parameters of the lens\nare determined up to the two-fold degeneracy: $u_0<0$ and $u_0>0$ solutions\ncaused by the well-known \"ecliptic\" degeneracy. It is found that the binary\nlens is composed of two M dwarf stars with similar masses $M_1=0.38\\pm 0.04\\\nM_\\odot$ ($0.50\\pm 0.05\\ M_\\odot)$ and $M_2=0.38\\pm 0.04\\ M_\\odot$ ($0.55\\pm\n0.06\\ M_\\odot$) and the distance to the lens is $D_{\\rm L}=2.77\\pm 0.23$ kpc\n($3.30\\pm 0.29$ kpc). Here the physical parameters out and in the parenthesis\nare for the $u_0<0$ and $u_0>0$ solutions, respectively.\n", "  Recent experimental efforts have led to considerable interest in donor-based\nlocalized electron spins in Si as viable qubits for a scalable silicon quantum\ncomputer. With the use of isotopically purified $^{28}$Si and the realization\nof extremely long spin coherence time in single-donor electrons, the recent\nexperimental focus is on two-coupled donors with the eventual goal of a\nscaled-up quantum circuit. Motivated by this development, we simulate the\nstatistical distribution of the exchange coupling $J$ between a pair of donors\nunder realistic donor placement straggles, and quantify the errors relative to\nthe intended $J$ value. With $J$ values in a broad range of donor-pair\nseparation ($5<|\\mathbf{R}|<60$ nm), we work out various cases systematically,\nfor a target donor separation $\\mathbf{R}_0$ along the [001], [110] and [111]\nSi crystallographic directions, with $|\\mathbf{R}_0|=10, 20$ or 30 nm and\nstandard deviation $\\sigma_R=1, 2, 5$ or 10 nm. Our extensive theoretical\nresults demonstrate the great challenge for a prescribed $J$ gate even with\njust a donor pair, a first step for any scalable Si-donor-based quantum\ncomputer.\n", "  We present simultaneous X-ray and radio observations of the black hole X-ray\nbinary V404 Cygni at the end of its 2015 outburst. From 2015 July 11-August 5\nwe monitored V404 Cygni with Chandra, Swift, and NuSTAR in the X-ray, and with\nthe Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array in the\nradio, spanning a range of luminosities that were poorly covered during its\nprevious outburst in 1989 (our 2015 campaign covers 2e33<Lx<1e34 erg/s). During\nour 2015 campaign, the X-ray spectrum evolved rapidly from a hard photon index\nof Gamma~1.6 (at Lx~1e34 erg/s) to a softer Gamma~2 (at Lx~3e33 erg/s). We\nargue that V404 Cygni reaching Gamma~2 marks the beginning of the quiescent\nspectral state, which occurs at a factor of ~3-4 higher X-ray luminosity than\nthe average pre-outburst luminosity of ~8e32 erg/s. V404 Cygni falls along the\nsame radio/X-ray luminosity correlation that it followed during its previous\noutburst in 1989, implying a robust disk-jet coupling. We exclude the\npossibility that a synchrotron cooled jet dominates the X-ray emission in\nquiescence, leaving synchrotron self-Compton from either a hot accretion flow\nor from a radiatively cooled jet as the most likely sources of X-ray radiation,\nand/or particle acceleration along the jet becoming less efficient in\nquiescence. Finally, we present the first indications of correlated radio and\nX-ray variability on minute timescales in quiescence, tentatively measuring the\nradio emission to lag the X-ray by 15+/-4 min, suggestive of X-ray variations\npropagating down a jet of length <3.0 AU.\n", "  Bright quasars, observed when the Universe was less than one billion years\nold (z>5.5), are known to host massive black holes (~10$^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$), and\nare thought to reside in the center of massive dark matter overdensities. In\nthis picture, overdensities of galaxies are expected around high redshift\nquasars. However, observations based on the detection of Lyman Break Galaxies\n(LBGs) around these quasars do not offer a clear picture: this may be due to\nthe uncertain redshift constraints of LBGs, which are selected through\nbroad-band filters only. To circumvent such uncertainties, we here perform a\nsearch for Lyman Alpha Emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the field of the quasar PSO\nJ215.1512-16.0417 at z~5.73, through narrow band, deep imaging with FORS2 at\nthe VLT. We study an area of 37 arcmin$^{2}$, i.e. ~206 comoving Mpc$^{2}$ at\nthe redshift of the quasar. We find no evidence for an overdensity of LAEs in\nthe quasar field with respect to blank field studies. Possible explanations for\nthese findings include that our survey volume is too small, or that the strong\nionizing radiation from the quasar hinders galaxy formation in its immediate\nproximity. Another possibility is that these quasars are not situated in the\ndense environments predicted by some simulations.\n", "  We present a reference study of the long-term optical variability of young\nstars using data from the WASP project. Our primary sample is a group of\nwell-studied classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), mostly in Taurus-Auriga. WASP\nlightcurves cover timescales up to 7 years and typically contain 10000-30000\ndatapoints. We quantify the variability as function of timescale using the\ntime-dependent standard deviation 'pooled sigma'. We find that the overwhelming\nmajority of CTTS has low-level variability with sigma<0.3mag dominated by\ntimescales of a few weeks, consistent with rotational modulation. Thus, for\nmost young stars monitoring over a month is sufficient to constrain the total\namount of variability over timescales up to a decade. The fraction of stars\nwith strong optical variability (sigma>0.3mag) is 21% in our sample and 21% in\nan unbiased control sample. An even smaller fraction (13% in our sample, 6% in\nthe control) show evidence for an increase in variability amplitude as a\nfunction of timescale from weeks to months or years. The presence of long-term\nvariability correlates with the spectral slope at 3-5mu, which is an indicator\nof inner disk geometry, and with the U-B band slope, which is an accretion\ndiagnostics. This shows that the long-term variations in CTTS are predominantly\ndriven by processes in the inner disk and in the accretion zone. Four of the\nstars with long-term variations show periods of 20-60d, significantly longer\nthan the rotation periods and stable over months to years. One possible\nexplanation are cyclic changes in the interaction between the disk and the\nstellar magnetic field.\n", "  It is a common practice in the solar physics community to test whether or not\nmeasured photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetograms are force-free,\nusing the Maxwell stress as a measure. Some previous studies have suggested\nthat magnetic fields of active regions in the solar chromosphere are close to\nbe force-free whereas there is no consistency among previous studies on whether\nmagnetic fields of active regions in the solar photosphere are force-free or\nnot. Here we use three kinds of representative magnetic fields (analytical\nforce-free solutions, modeled solar-like force-free fields and observed\nnon-force-free fields) to discuss on how the measurement issues such as limited\nfield of view, instrument sensitivity and measurement error could affect the\nestimation of force-freeness based on observed magnetograms. Unlike previous\nstudies that focus on discussing the effect of limited field of view or\ninstrument sensitivity, our calculation shows that just measurement error alone\ncan significantly influence the results of force-freeness estimate, due to the\nfact that measurement errors in horizontal magnetic fields are usually ten\ntimes larger than that of the vertical fields. This property of measurement\nerrors, interacting with the particular form of force-freeness estimate\nformula, would result in wrong judgments of the force-freeness: a truly\nforce-free field may be mistakenly estimated as being non-force-free and a true\nnon-force-free field may be estimated as being force-free. Our analysis calls\nfor caution when interpreting the force-freeness estimates based on measured\nmagnetograms, and also suggests that the true photospheric magnetic field may\nbe further away from being force-free than they currently appear to be.\n", "  The small-scale bipolar jets having short dynamical ages from \"water fountain\n(WF)\" sources are regarded as an indication of the onset of circumstellar\nenvelope morphological metamorphosis of intermediate-mass stars. Such process\nusually happens at the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. However,\nrecent studies found that WFs could be AGB stars or even early planetary\nnebulae. This fact prompted the idea that WFs may not necessarily be objects at\nthe beginning of the morphological transition process. In the present work, we\nshow that WFs could have different envelope morphologies by studying their\nspectral energy distribution profiles. Some WFs have spherical envelopes that\nresembles usual AGB stars, while others have aspherical envelopes which are\nmore common to post-AGB stars. The results imply that WFs may not represent the\nearliest stage of the morphological metamorphosis. We further argue that the\ndynamical age of a WF jet, which can be calculated from maser proper motions,\nmay not be the real age of the jet. The dynamical age cannot be used to justify\nthe moment when the envelope begins to become aspherical, nor to tell the\nconcrete evolutionary status of the object. A WF jet could be the innermost\npart of a larger well-developed jet, which is not necessarily a young jet.\n", "  The high-energy emission from low-mass stars is mediated by the magnetic\ndynamo. Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate\nlarge-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for\nsolar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new\noptical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our\nobservations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202\nmeasurements or non-detections of H$\\alpha$ emission in nearby M dwarfs. This\nincludes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1\nand 0.6 solar masses are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow\nrotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that\nseparates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the\nfast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the\nrotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease.\nThe well- defined active/inactive boundary indicates that H$\\alpha$ activity is\na useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g. for target selection for\nexoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs.\nWe also find a significant, moderate correlation between\n$L_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha}/L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ and variability amplitude: more active\nstars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with\nprevious work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of\n$L_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha}/L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$. Our data also show a clear power-law\ndecay in $L_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha}/L_{\\mathrm{bol}}$ with Rossby number for slow\nrotators, with an index of $-1.7 \\pm 0.1$.\n", "  The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey is a deep (with a $2\\sigma$\ndetection limit $\\mu_g$ = 29~mag~arcsec$^{-2}$ in the $g-$band) optical\npanchromatic survey targeting the Virgo cluster from its core to virial radius,\nfor a total areal coverage of 104 square degrees. As such, the survey is well\nsuited for the study of galaxies' outskirts, haloes and low surface brightness\nfeatures that arise from dynamical interactions within the cluster environment.\nWe report the discovery of extremely faint ($\\mu_g$ $>$ 25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$)\nshells in three Virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies, VCC~1361, VCC~1447 and\nVCC~1668. Among them, VCC~1447 has an absolute magnitude M$_{g}$ = -11.71 mag\nand is {\\it the least massive galaxy with a shell system discovered to date}.\nWe present a detailed study of these low surface brightness features. We detect\nbetween three and four shells in each of our galaxies. Within the\nuncertainties, we find no evidence of a color difference between the galaxy\nmain body and shell features. The observed arcs of the shells are located upto\nseveral effective radii of the galaxies. We further explore the origin of these\nlow surface brightness features with the help of idealized numerical\nsimulations. We find that a near equal mass merger is best able to reproduce\nthe main properties of the shells, including their quite symmetric appearance\nand their alignment along the major axis of the galaxy. The simulations provide\nsupport for a formation scenario in which a recent merger, between two\nnear-equal mass, gas-free dwarf galaxies forms the observed shell systems.\n", "  The CPA-laser is a coexisting state of coherent perfect absorption and lasing\nthat was proposed in parity-time ($\\cal PT$) symmetric photonic systems. In\nthis work we show that the spectral signature of a CPA-laser displayed by the\nsingular value spectrum of the scattering matrix ($S$) can be orders of\nmagnitude wider than that displayed by the eigenvalue spectrum of $S$. Since\nthe former reflects how strongly light can be absorbed or amplified and the\nlatter announces the spontaneous symmetry breaking of $S$, these contrasting\nspectral signatures indicate that near perfect absorption and extremely strong\namplification can be achieved even in the $\\cal PT$-symmetric phase of $S$,\nwhich is known for and defined by its flux-conserving eigenstates. We also show\nthat these contrasting spectral signatures are accompanied by strikingly\ndifferent sensitivities to disorder and imperfection, suggesting that the\neigenvalue spectrum is potentially suitable for sensing and the singular value\nspectrum for robust switching.\n", "  Coronal loops, constituting the basic building blocks of the active Sun,\nserve as primary targets to help understand the mechanisms responsible for\nmaintaining multi-million Kelvin temperatures in the solar and stellar coronae.\nDespite significant advances in observations and theory, our knowledge on the\nfundamental properties of these structures is limited. Here, we present\nunprecedented observations of accelerating slow magnetoacoustic waves along a\ncoronal loop that show differential propagation speeds in two distinct\ntemperature channels, revealing the multi-stranded and multi-thermal nature of\nthe loop. Utilizing the observed speeds and employing nonlinear force-free\nmagnetic field extrapolations, we derive the actual temperature variation along\nthe loop in both channels, and thus are able to resolve two individual\ncomponents of the multi-thermal loop for the first time. The obtained positive\ntemperature gradients indicate uniform heating along the loop, rather than\nisolated footpoint heating.\n", "  In the current paradigm, it is believed that the compact VLBI radio core of\nradio-loud AGNs represents the innermost upstream regions of relativistic\noutflows. These regions of AGN jets have generally been modeled by a conical\noutflow with roughly constant opening angle and flow speed. Nonetheless, some\nworks suggest that a parabolic geometry would be more appropriate to fit the\nhigh energy spectral energy distribution properties and it has been recently\nfound that, at least in some nearby radio-galaxies, the geometry of the\ninnermost regions of the jet is parabolic. We compile here multi-frequency core\nsizes of archival data to investigate the typically unresolved upstream regions\nof the jet geometry of a sample of 56 radio-loud AGNs. Data combined from the\nsources considered here is not consistent with the classic picture of a conical\njet starting in the vicinity of the super-massive black hole (SMBH), and may\nexclude a pure parabolic outflow solution, but rather suggest an intermediate\nsolution with quasi-parabolic streams, which are frequently seen in numerical\nsimulations. Inspection of the large opening angles near the SMBH and the range\nof the Lorentz factors derived from our results support our analyses. Our\nresult suggests that the conical jet paradigm in AGNs needs to be re-examined\nby mm/sub-mm VLBI observations.\n", "  We present an extended corona model based on ray-tracing simulations to\ninvestigate X-ray time lags in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This model\nconsists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce\nthe reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the\ndirectly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the\nlight-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe\nthe disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are\ntriggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond\nin different ways (i.e. having different source responses). The variations of\neach source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist\nof a combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended\ncorona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft\n(reverberation) lags. Fitting the model to the timing data of PG~1244+026\nreveals the hard and soft X-ray sources at $\\sim6r_{\\text{g}}$ and\n$\\sim11r_{\\text{g}}$, respectively. The upper source produces small amounts of\nreflection and can be interpreted as a relativistic jet, or outflowing blob,\nwhose emission is beamed away from the disc. This explains the observed\nlag-energy in which there is no soft lag at energies $<1$~keV as they are\ndiluted by the soft continuum of the upper source. Finally, our models suggest\nthat the fluctuations propagating between the two sources of PG~1244+026 are\npossible but only at near the speed of light.\n", "  The main objective of this study is the characterization of the velocity\nfield in the Cygnus OB1 association using the radial velocity data currently\navailable in the literature. This association is part of a larger star-forming\ncomplex located in the direction of the Cygnus region, but whose main\nsubsystems may be distributed at different distances from the sun. We have\ncollected radial velocity data for more than 300 stars in the area of 5 x 5\nsquare degrees centred on the Cygnus OB1 association. We present the results of\na kinematic clustering analysis in the subspace of the phase space formed by\nangular coordinates and radial velocity using two independent methodologies. We\nhave found evidence of structure in the phase space with the detection of two\nmain groups, corresponding to different radial velocity and distance values,\nbelonging to the association, and associated with two main shells defined by\nthe Halpha emission. A third grouping well separated from the other two in\nvelocity appears to occupy the whole region associated with what has been\ncalled \"common shell\".\n", "  It is a common assumption that high-altitude open clusters live longer\ncompared with clusters moving close to the Galactic plane. This is because at\nhigh altitudes, open clusters are far from the disruptive effects of in-plane\nsubstructures, such as spiral arms, molecular clouds and the bar. However, an\nimportant aspect to consider in this scenario is that orbits of high-altitude\nopen clusters will eventually cross the Galactic plane, where the vertical\ntidal field of the disk is strong. In this work we simulate the interaction of\nopen clusters with the tidal field of a detailed Milky Way Galactic model at\ndifferent average altitudes and galactocentric radii. We find that the life\nexpectancy of clusters decreases as the maximum orbital altitude increases and\nreaches a minimum at altitudes of approximately 600 pc. Clusters near the\nGalactic plane live longer because they do not experience strong vertical tidal\nshocks from the Galactic disk; then, for orbital altitudes higher than 600 pc,\nclusters start again to live longer due to the decrease in the number of\nencounters with the disk. With our study, we find that the compressive nature\nof the tides in the arms region and the bar have an important role on the\nsurvival of small clusters by protecting them from disruption: clusters inside\nthe arms can live up to twice as long as those outside the arms at similar\ngalactocentric distance.\n", "  We take advantage of our recently published model for Galaxy Evolution and\nAssembly (GAEA) to study the origin of the observed correlation between\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] and galaxy stellar mass. In particular, we analyse the role of\nradio mode AGN feedback, that recent work has identified as a crucial\ningredient to reproduce observations. In GAEA, this process introduces the\nobserved trend of star formation histories extending over shorter time-scales\nfor more massive galaxies, but does not provide a sufficient condition to\nreproduce the observed $\\alpha$ enhancements of massive galaxies. In the\nframework of our model, this is possible only assuming that any residual star\nformation is truncated for galaxies more massive than $10^{10.5}\\,{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$. This results, however, in even shorter star formation time-scales\nfor the most massive galaxies, that translate in total stellar metallicities\nsignificantly lower than observed. Our results demonstrate that (i) trends of\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios cannot be simply converted in relative time-scale\nindicators, and (ii) AGN feedback cannot explain alone the positive correlation\nbetween [$\\alpha$/Fe] and galaxy mass/velocity dispersion. Reproducing\nsimultaneously the mass-metallicity relation and the $\\alpha$ enhancements\nobserved poses a challenge for hierarchical models, unless more exotic\nsolutions are adopted such as metal-rich winds or a variable IMF.\n", "  We studied the formation of the first penumbral sector around a pore in the\nfollowing polarity of the Active Region (AR) NOAA 11490. We used a high\nspatial, spectral, and temporal resolution data set acquired by the\nInterferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer operating at the NSO/Dunn Solar\nTelescope as well as data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite. On the side towards the leading\npolarity, elongated granules in the photosphere and an arch filament system\n(AFS) in the chromosphere are present, while the magnetic field shows a\nsea-serpent configuration, indicating a region of magnetic flux emergence. We\nfound that the formation of a stable penumbra in the following polarity of the\nAR begins in the area facing the opposite polarity located below the AFS in the\nflux emergence region, differently from what found by Schlichenmaier and\ncolleaguestbf. Moreover, during the formation of the first penumbral sector,\nthe area characterized by magnetic flux density larger than 900 G and the area\nof the umbra increase.\n", "  We derive the galaxy luminosity function in the $K_s$ band for galaxies in 24\nclusters to provide a local reference for higher redshift studies and to\nanalyse how and if the luminosity function varies according to environment and\ncluster properties. We use new, deep $K$ band imaging and match the photometry\nto available redshift information and to optical photometry from the SDSS or\nthe UKST/POSS: $>80\\%$ of the galaxies to $K \\sim 14.5$ have measured\nredshifts. We derive composite luminosity functions, for the entire sample and\nfor cluster subsamples . We consider the luminosity functions for red sequence\nand blue cloud galaxies. The full composite luminosity function has $K^*=12.79\n\\pm 0.14$ ($M_K=-24.81$) and $\\alpha=-1.41 \\pm 0.10$. We find that $K^*$ is\nlargely unaffected by the environment but that the slope $\\alpha$ increases\ntowards lower mass clusters and clusters with Bautz-Morgan type $<$ II. The red\nsequence luminosity function seems to be approximately universal (within\nerrors) in all environments: it has parameters $K^*=13.16 \\pm 0.15$\n($M_K=-24.44$) and $\\alpha=-1.00 \\pm 0.12$ (for all galaxies). Blue galaxies do\nnot show a good fit to a Schechter function, but the best values for its\nparameters are $K^*=13.51 \\pm 0.41$ ($M_K=-24.09$) and $\\alpha=-1.60 \\pm 0.29$:\nwe do not have enough statistics to consider environmental variations for these\ngalaxies. We find some evidence that $K^*$ in clusters is brighter than in the\nfield and $\\alpha$ is steeper, but note this comparison is based (for the\nfield) on 2MASS photometry, while our data are considerably deeper.\n", "  We present Monte Carlo line transfer models that investigate the effects of\ndust on the very late time emission line spectra of the core collapse\nsupernovae SN 1980K and SN 1993J and the young core collapse supernova remnant\nCassiopeia A. Their blue-shifted emission peaks, resulting from the removal by\ndust of redshifted photons emitted from the far sides of the remnants, and the\npresence of extended red emission wings are used to constrain dust compositions\nand radii and to determine the masses of dust in the remnants. We estimate dust\nmasses of between 0.08 - 0.15 M$_\\odot$ for SN 1993J at year 16, 0.12 - 0.30\nM$_\\odot$ for SN 1980K at year 30 and $\\sim$1.1 M$_\\odot$ for Cas A at year\n$\\sim$330. Our models for the strong oxygen forbidden lines of Cas A require\nthe overall modelled profiles to be shifted to the red by between 700 - 1000 km\ns$^{-1}$, consistent with previous estimates for the shift of the dynamical\ncentroid of this remnant.\n", "  We have traced the spatial distributions of intermediate-age and old stars in\nnine dwarf galaxies in the distant parts of the Local Group, using multi-epoch\n3.6 and 4.5 micron data from the DUST in Nearby Galaxies with Spitzer\n(DUSTiNGS) survey. Using complementary optical imaging from the Hubble Space\nTelescope, we identify the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the 3.6 micron\nphotometry, separating thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB)\nstars from the larger red giant branch (RGB) populations. Unlike the constant\nTRGB in the I-band, at 3.6 micron the TRGB magnitude varies by ~0.7 mag, making\nit unreliable as a distance indicator. The intermediate-age and old stars are\nwell mixed in two-thirds of the sample with no evidence of a gradient in the\nratio of the intermediate-age to old stellar populations outside the central\n~1-2'. Variable AGB stars are detected in the outer extremities of the\ngalaxies, indicating that chemical enrichment from these dust-producing stars\nmay occur in the outer regions of galaxies with some frequency. Theories of\nstructure formation in dwarf galaxies must account for the lack of radial\ngradients in intermediate-age populations and the presence of these stars in\nthe outer extremities of dwarfs. Finally, we identify unique features in\nindividual galaxies, such as extended tidal features in Sex A and Sag DIG and a\ncentral concentration of AGB stars in the inner regions of NGC 185 and NGC 147.\n", "  Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), especially the larger ones,\nemanate from active regions (ARs). With the aim to understand the magnetic\nproperties that govern such flares and eruptions, we systematically survey all\nflare events with GOES levels of >=M5.0 within 45 deg from disk center between\nMay 2010 and April 2016. These criteria lead to a total of 51 flares from 29\nARs, for which we analyze the observational data obtained by the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. More than 80% of the 29 ARs are found to exhibit delta-sunspots\nand at least three ARs violate Hale's polarity rule. The flare durations are\napproximately proportional to the distance between the two flare ribbons, to\nthe total magnetic flux inside the ribbons, and to the ribbon area. From our\nstudy, one of the parameters that clearly determine whether a given flare event\nis CME-eruptive or not is the ribbon area normalized by the sunspot area, which\nmay indicate that the structural relationship between the flaring region and\nthe entire AR controls CME productivity. AR characterization show that even\nX-class events do not require delta-sunspots or strong-field, high-gradient\npolarity inversion lines. An investigation of historical observational data\nsuggests the possibility that the largest solar ARs, with magnetic flux of\n2x10^23 Mx, might be able to produce \"superflares\" with energies of order of\n10^34 erg. The proportionality between the flare durations and magnetic\nenergies is consistent with stellar flare observations, suggesting a common\nphysical background for solar and stellar flares.\n", "  Molecular hydrogen absorption in the damped Lyman-alpha system at z = 2.34\ntowards quasar Q1232+082 is analyzed in order to derive a constraint on a\npossible temporal variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu, over\ncosmological timescales. Some 106 H2 and HD transitions, covering the range\n3290-3726 \\AA, are analyzed with a comprehensive fitting technique, allowing\nfor the inclusion of overlapping lines associated with hydrogen molecules, the\natomic hydrogen lines in the Lyman-alpha forest as well as metal lines. The\nabsorption model, based on the most recent and accurate rest wavelength for H2\nand HD transitions, delivers a value of dmu/mu = (19 +/- 9 +/- 5)x 10^(-6). An\nattempt to correct the spectrum for possible long-range wavelength distortions\nis made and the uncertainty on the distortion correction is included in the\ntotal systematic uncertainty. The present result is an order of magnitude more\nstringent than a previous measurement from the analysis of this absorption\nsystem, based on a line-by-line comparison of only 12 prominent and isolated H2\nabsorption lines. This is consistent with other measurements of dmu/mu from 11\nother absorption systems in showing a null variation of the proton-to-electron\nmass ratio over a look-back time of 11 Gyrs.\n", "  We probe the structure and kinematics of two neighbouring H II regions\nidentified as cometary and bipolar, using radio recombination lines (RRL). The\nH172{\\alpha} RRLs from these H II regions: G351.6-1.15 and G351.6-1.25, are\nmapped using GMRT, India. We also detect carbon RRLs C172{\\alpha} towards both\nthese regions. The hydrogen RRLs display the effects of pressure and dynamical\nbroadening in the line profiles, with the dynamical broadening (15 km/s)\nplaying a major role in the observed profile of G351.6-1.15. We investigate the\nkinematics of molecular gas species towards this H II region from the MALT90\npilot survey. The molecular gas is mostly distributed towards the north and\nnorth-west of the cometary head. The molecular line profiles indicate\nsignatures of turbulence and outflow in this region. The ionized gas at the\ncometary tail is blue shifted by 8 km/s with respect to the ambient molecular\ncloud, consistent with the earlier proposed champagne flow scenario. The\nrelative velocity of 5 km/s between the northern and southern lobes of the\nbipolar H II region G351.6-1.25 is consistent with the premise that the bipolar\nmorphology is a result of the expanding ionized lobes within a flat molecular\ncloud.\n", "  The observationally complete sample of the main belt asteroids now spans more\nthan two orders of magnitude in size and numbers more than 64,000 (excluding\ncollisional family members). We undertook an analysis of asteroids'\neccentricities and their interpretation with simple physical models. We find\nthat Plummer's (1916) conclusion that the asteroids' eccentricities follow a\nRayleigh distribution holds for the osculating eccentricities of large\nasteroids, but the proper eccentricities deviate from a Rayleigh distribution:\nthere is a deficit of eccentricities smaller than $\\sim0.1$ and an excess of\nlarger eccentricities. We further find that the proper eccentricities do not\ndepend significantly on asteroid size but have strong dependence on\nheliocentric distance: the outer asteroid belt follows a Rayleigh distribution,\nbut the inner belt is strikingly different. Eccentricities in the inner belt\ncan be modeled as a vector sum of a primordial eccentricity vector of random\norientation and magnitude drawn from a Rayleigh distribution of parameter\n$\\sim0.06$, and an excitation of random phase and magnitude $\\sim0.13$. These\nresults imply that a late dynamical excitation of the asteroids occurred, it\nwas independent of asteroid size, it was stronger in the inner belt than in the\nouter belt. We discuss implications for the primordial asteroid belt and\nsuggest that the observationally complete sample size of main belt asteroids is\nlarge enough that more sophisticated model-fitting of the eccentricities is\nwarranted and could serve to test alternative theoretical models of the\ndynamical excitation history of asteroids and its links to the migration\nhistory of the giant planets.\n", "  The search for chemically unevolved galaxies remains prevalent in the nearby\nUniverse, mostly because these systems provide excellent proxies for exploring\nin detail the physics of high-z systems. The most promising candidates are\nextremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs), i.e., galaxies with <1/10 solar\nmetallicity. However, due to the bright emission line based search criteria\ntraditionally used to find XMPs, we may not be sampling the full XMP\npopulation. In 2014 we reoriented this search using only morphological\nproperties and uncovered a population of ~150 `blue diffuse dwarf (BDD)\ngalaxies', and published a sub-sample of 12 BDD spectra. Here we present\noptical spectroscopic observations of a larger sample of 51 BDDs, along with\ntheir SDSS photometric properties. With our improved statistics, we use\ndirect-method abundances to confirm that BDDs are chemically unevolved\n(7.43<12+log(O/H)<8.01), with ~20% of our sample classified as being XMP\ngalaxies, and find they are actively forming stars at rates of 1-33x10^-2\nM_sol/yr in HII regions randomly embedded in a blue, low-surface brightness\ncontinuum. Stellar masses are calculated from population synthesis models and\nestimated to be in the range log(M_star/M_sol) ~5-9. Unlike other\nlow-metallicity star-forming galaxies, BDDs are in agreement with the\nmass-metallicity relation at low masses, suggesting they are not accreting\nlarge amounts of pristine gas relative to their stellar mass. BDD galaxies\nappear to be a population of actively star-forming dwarf irregular (dIrr)\ngalaxies who fall within the class of low-surface brightness dIrr galaxies.\nTheir ongoing star-formation and irregular morphology make them excellent\nanalogues for galaxies in the early Universe.\n", "  According to optical stellar kinematics observations, an over-massive black\nhole candidate has been reported by van den Bosch et al. (2012) in the normal\nearly-type galaxy NGC 1277. This galaxy is located in the central region of the\nPerseus cluster. Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations have\nshown that NGC 1277 and other early-type galaxies in the neighbourhood have\nradio counterparts. These nuclear radio sources have stable flux densities on\ntime scale of years. In order to investigate the origin of the radio emission\nfrom these normal galaxies, we selected five sources (NGC 1270, NGC 1272, NGC\n1277, NGC 1278 and VZw 339) residing in the central 10 arcminute region of the\nPerseus cluster and requested to re-correlate the data of an existing very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment at these new positions. With the\nre-correlation data provided by the European VLBI Network (EVN), we imaged the\nfive sources with a resolution of about eight milliarcseconds and detected all\nof them with a confidence level above 5{\\sigma} at 1.4 GHz. They show compact\nstructure and brightness temperatures above $10^7$ K, which implies that the\nradio emission is non-thermal. We rule out ongoing nuclear star formation and\nconclude that these VLBI-detected radio sources are parsec-scale jet activity\nassociated with the supermassive black holes in low luminosity active galactic\nnuclei (LLAGNs), although there are no clear signs of nuclear activity observed\nin the optical and infrared bands. Using the fundamental plane relation in\nblack holes, we find no significant evidence for or against an extremely\nmassive black hole hiding in NGC 1277.\n", "  We have developed a method to determine the transient surface density and\ntransient rate for any given survey, using Monte-Carlo simulations. This method\nallows us to determine the transient rate as a function of both the flux and\nthe duration of the transients in the whole flux-duration plane rather than one\nor a few points as currently available methods do. It is applicable to every\nsurvey strategy that is monitoring the same part of the sky, regardless the\ninstrument or wavelength of the survey, or the target sources. We have\nsimulated both top-hat and Fast Rise Exponential Decay light curves,\nhighlighting how the shape of the light curve might affect the detectability of\ntransients. Another application for this method is to estimate the number of\ntransients of a given kind that are expected to be detected by a survey,\nprovided that their rate is known.\n", "  Radio polarization measurements of pulsed emission from pulsars offer a\nvaluable insight into the basic geometry of the neutron star: inclination angle\nbetween the magnetic and rotation axis and inclination of the line of sight. So\nfar, all studies about radio polarization focused on the standard rotating\nvector model with the underlying assumption of a centred dipole. In this\nletter, we extend this model to the most general off-centred dipole\nconfiguration and give an exact closed analytic expression for the\nphase-resolved polarization angle. It is shown that contrary to the rotating\nvector model, for an off-centred dipole, the polarization angle also depends on\nthe emission altitude. Although the fitting parameter space increases from two\nto six (position of the dipole, altitude and shift of the zero phase),\nstatistical analysis should remain tractable. Observations revealing an\nevolution of the polarization angle with frequency would undeniably furnish a\nstrong hint for the presence of a decentred magnetic dipole in neutron stars.\n", "  The Hoffmeister family is a C-type group located in the central main belt.\nDynamically, it is important because of its interaction with the ${\\nu}_{1C}$\nnodal secular resonance with Ceres, that significantly increases the dispersion\nin inclination of family members at lower semi-major axis. As an effect, the\ndistribution of inclination values of the Hoffmeister family at semi-major axis\nlower than its center is significantly leptokurtic, and this can be used to set\nconstraints on the terminal ejection velocity field of the family at the time\nit was produced. By performing an analysis of the time behaviour of the\nkurtosis of the $v_W$ component of the ejection velocity field\n(${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$), as obtained from Gauss' equations, for different\nfictitious Hoffmeister families with different values of the ejection velocity\nfield, we were able to exclude that the Hoffmeister family should be older than\n335 Myr. Constraints from the currently observed inclination distribution of\nthe Hoffmeister family suggest that its terminal ejection velocity parameter\n$V_{EJ}$ should be lower than 25~m/s. Results of a Yarko-YORP Monte Carlo\nmethod to family dating, combined with other constraints from inclinations and\n${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$, indicate that the Hoffmeister family should be\n$220^{+60}_{-40}$~Myr old, with an ejection parameter $V_{EJ}= 20\\pm5$~m/s.\n", "  Some globular clusters host multiple stellar populations with different\nchemical abundance patterns. This is particularly true for $\\omega$ Centauri,\nwhich shows clear evidence of a helium- enriched sub-population characterized\nby a helium abundance as high as $Y= 0.4$. We present a whole and consistent\nset of evolutionary tracks from the ZAMS to the white dwarf stage appropriate\nfor the study of the formation and evolution of white dwarfs resulting from the\nevolution of helium-rich progenitors. Different issues of the white dwarf\nevolution and their helium-rich progenitors have been explored. In particular,\nthe final mass of the remnants, the role of overshooting during the\nthermally-pulsing phase, and the cooling of the resulting white dwarfs differ\nmarkedly from the evolutionary predictions of progenitor stars with standard\ninitial helium abundance. Finally, the pulsational properties of the resulting\nwhite dwarfs are also explored. We find that, for the range of initial masses\nexplored in this paper, the final mass of the helium-rich progenitors is\nmarkedly larger than the final mass expected from progenitors with the usual\nhelium abundance. We also find that progenitors with initial mass smaller than\n$M_\\star \\simeq 0.65\\,M_\\odot$ evolve directly into helium-core white dwarfs in\nless than 14~Gyr, and that for larger progenitor masses the evolution of the\nresulting low-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs is dominated by residual nuclear\nburning. For helium-core white dwarfs, we find that they evolve markedly faster\nthan their counterparts coming from standard progenitors. Also, in contrast\nwith what occurs for white dwarfs resulting from progenitors with the standard\nhelium abundance, the impact of residual burning on the cooling time of white\ndwarfs is not affected by the occurrence of overshooting during the\nthermally-pulsing phase of progenitor stars.\n", "  Recent photometric analysis of the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of young\nmassive clusters (YMCs) have found evidence for splitting in the main sequence\nand extended main sequence turn-offs, both of which have been suggested to be\ncaused by stellar rotation. Comparison of the observed main sequence splitting\nwith models has led various authors to suggest a rather extreme stellar\nrotation distribution, with a minority ($10-30$\\%) of stars with low rotational\nvelocities and the remainder ($70-90$\\%) of stars rotating near the critical\nrotation (i.e., near break-up). We test this hypothesis by searching for Be\nstars within two YMCs in the LMC (NGC 1850 and NGC 1856), which are thought to\nbe critically rotating stars with decretion disks that are (partially) ionised\nby their host stars. In both clusters we detect large populations of Be stars\nat the main sequence turn-off ($\\sim30-60$\\% of stars), which supports previous\nsuggestions of large populations of rapidly rotating stars within massive\nclusters.\n", "  One of the most unexpected results in the field of stellar populations of the\nlast few years, is the discovery that some Magellanic-Cloud globular clusters\nyounger than ~400 Myr, exhibit bimodal main sequences (MSs) in their\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Moreover, these young clusters host an\nextended main sequence turn off (eMSTO) in close analogy with what is observed\nin most ~1-2 Gyr old clusters of both Magellanic Clouds.\n  We use high-precision Hubble-Space-Telescope photometry to study the young\nstar cluster NGC1866 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We discover an eMSTO and a\nsplit MS. The analysis of the CMD reveals that (i) the blue MS is the less\npopulous one, hosting about one-third of the total number of MS stars; (ii)\nred-MS stars are more centrally concentrated than blue-MS stars; (iii) the\nfraction of blue-MS stars with respect to the total number of MS stars drops by\na factor of ~2 in the upper MS with F814W <~19.7.\n  The comparison between the observed CMDs and stellar models reveals that the\nobservations are consistent with ~200 Myr old highly-rotating stars on the\nred-MS, with rotation close to critical value, plus a non-rotating stellar\npopulation spanning an age interval between ~140 and 220 Myr, on the blue-MS.\nNoticeable, neither stellar populations with different ages only, nor coeval\nstellar models with different rotation rates, properly reproduce the observed\nsplit MS and eMSTO. We discuss these results in the context of the eMSTO and\nmultiple MS phenomenon.\n", "  We present an experimental demonstration of a Laguerre-Gauss (LG) spectrum\nmeasurement technique using variable focus lenses that is able to measure the\nstrengths of all modes present in an unknown, incoming light beam with the\nhighest possible efficiency. The experiment modifies the classical projective,\nphase flattening technique by including a variable sized pinhole and a two\nelectronic lens variable imaging system that is tuned for each mode to give the\nhighest possible detection efficiency irrespective of the beam waist of LG mode\nchosen for the projection/decomposition. The modified experiment preserves the\northogonality between the modes with only a 4 \\% cross-talk so that\nsuperposition states may also be detected efficiently. Our experiment results\nshow efficient detection of OAM vortex beams with topological charge, $l$,\nvalues ranging from 0 to 4 with various different beam waists chosen for the\ndecomposition.\n", "  We present the results from our search for HI 21-cm absorption in a sample of\n16 strong FeII systems ($W_{\\rm r}$(MgII $\\lambda2796$) $\\ge1.0$ \\AA\\ and\n$W_{\\rm r}$(FeII $\\lambda2600$) or $W_{\\rm FeII}$ $\\ge1$ \\AA) at $0.5<z<1.5$\nusing the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope. We\nreport six new HI 21-cm absorption detections from our sample, which have\nincreased the known number of detections in strong MgII systems at this\nredshift range by $\\sim50$%. Combining our measurements with those in the\nliterature, we find that the detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption increases\nwith $W_{\\rm FeII}$, being four times higher in systems with $W_{\\rm FeII}$\n$\\ge1$ \\AA\\ compared to systems with $W_{\\rm FeII}$ $<1$ \\AA. The $N$(HI)\nassociated with the HI 21-cm absorbers would be $\\ge 2 \\times 10^{20}$\ncm$^{-2}$, assuming a spin temperature of $\\sim500$ K (based on HI 21-cm\nabsorption measurements of damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ systems at this redshift\nrange) and unit covering factor. We find that HI 21-cm absorption arises on an\naverage in systems with stronger metal absorption. We also find that quasars\nwith HI 21-cm absorption detected towards them have systematically higher\n$E(B-V)$ values than those which do not. Further, by comparing the velocity\nwidths of HI 21-cm absorption lines detected in absorption- and galaxy-selected\nsamples, we find that they show an increasing trend (significant at\n$3.8\\sigma$) with redshift at $z<3.5$, which could imply that the absorption\noriginates from more massive galaxy haloes at high-$z$. Increasing the number\nof HI 21-cm absorption detections at these redshifts is important to confirm\nvarious trends noted here with higher statistical significance.\n", "  How can we discover objects we did not know existed within the large datasets\nthat now abound in astronomy? We present an outlier detection algorithm that we\ndeveloped, based on an unsupervised Random Forest. We test the algorithm on\nmore than two million galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nexamine the 400 galaxies with the highest outlier score. We find objects which\nhave extreme emission line ratios and abnormally strong absorption lines,\nobjects with unusual continua, including extremely reddened galaxies. We find\ngalaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses, double-peaked emission line galaxies, and\nclose galaxy pairs. We find galaxies with high ionisation lines, galaxies which\nhost supernovae, and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of\nthe outliers we find were reported by previous studies that used specific and\ntailored algorithms to find a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is\ngeneral and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what\nmakes them peculiar. It can be executed on imaging, time-series, and other\nspectroscopic data, operates well with thousands of features, is not sensitive\nto missing values, and is easily parallelisable.\n", "  About 1/3 of X-ray-luminous clusters show smooth, Mpc-scale radio emission,\nknown as giant radio haloes. One promising model for radio haloes is Fermi-II\nacceleration of seed relativistic electrons by compressible turbulence. The\norigin of these seed electrons has never been fully explored. Here, we\nintegrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton\ndistributions when post-processing cosmological simulations of cluster\nformation, and confront them with radio surface brightness and spectral data of\nComa. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed\nelectron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.\nMatching observations requires modifying properties of the CR population (rapid\nstreaming; enhanced CR electron acceleration at shocks) or turbulence\n(increasing turbulent-to-thermal energy density with radius), but at the\nexpense of fine-tuning. In a parameter study, we find that radio properties are\nexponentially sensitive to the amplitude of turbulence, which is inconsistent\nwith small scatter in scaling relations. This sensitivity is removed if we\nrelate the acceleration time to the turbulent dissipation time. In this case,\nturbulence above a threshold value provides a fixed amount of amplification;\nobservations could thus potentially constrain the unknown CR seed population.\nTo obtain sufficient acceleration, the turbulent magneto-hydrodynamics cascade\nhas to terminate by transit time damping on CRs, i.e., thermal particles must\nbe scattered by plasma instabilities. Understanding the small scatter in radio\nhalo scaling relations may provide a rich source of insight on plasma processes\nin clusters.\n", "  We develop a statistical estimator to infer the redshift probability\ndistribution of a photometric sample of galaxies from its angular\ncross-correlation in redshift bins with an overlapping spectroscopic sample.\nThis estimator is a minimum variance weighted quadratic function of the data: a\nquadratic estimator. This extends and modifies the methodology presented by\nMcQuinn & White (2013). The derived source redshift distribution is degenerate\nwith the source galaxy bias, which must be constrained via additional\nassumptions. We apply this estimator to constrain source galaxy redshift\ndistributions in the Kilo-Degree imaging survey through cross-correlation with\nthe spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey, presenting results first as a\nbinned step-wise distribution in the range z < 0.8, and then building a\ncontinuous distribution using a Gaussian process model. We demonstrate the\nrobustness of our methodology using mock catalogues constructed from N-body\nsimulations, and comparisons with other techniques for inferring the redshift\ndistribution.\n", "  There is solid observational evidence on the existence of massive, $M\\sim\n1~M_\\odot$, highly magnetized white dwarfs (WDs) with surface magnetic fields\nup to $B\\sim 10^9$ G. We show that, if in addition to these features, the star\nis fast rotating, it can become a rotation-powered pulsar-like WD and emit\ndetectable high-energy radiation. We infer the values of the structure\nparameters (mass, radius, moment of inertia), magnetic field, rotation period\nand spin-down rates of a WD pulsar death-line. We show that WDs above the\ndeath-line emit blackbody radiation in the soft X-ray band via the magnetic\npolar cap heating by back flowing pair-created particle bombardment and discuss\nas an example the X-ray emission of soft gamma-repeaters and anomalous X-ray\npulsars within the WD model.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the new LUNA rate for the nuclear reaction\n$^{22}$Ne$(p,\\gamma)^{23}$Na on the chemical ejecta of intermediate-mass stars,\nwith particular focus on the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB)\nstars that experience hot-bottom burning. To this aim we use the PARSEC and\nCOLIBRI codes to compute the complete evolution, from the pre-main sequence up\nto the termination of the TP-AGB phase, of a set of stellar models with initial\nmasses in the range $3.0\\,M_{\\odot} - 6.0\\,M_{\\odot}$, and metallicities\n$Z_{\\rm i}=0.0005$, $Z_{\\rm i}=0.006$, and $Z_{\\rm i} = 0.014$. We find that\nthe new LUNA measures have much reduced the nuclear uncertainties of the\n$^{22}$Ne and $^{23}$Na AGB ejecta, which drop from factors of $\\simeq 10$ to\nonly a factor of few for the lowest metallicity models. Relying on the most\nrecent estimations for the destruction rate of $^{23}$Na, the uncertainties\nthat still affect the $^{22}$Ne and $^{23}$Na AGB ejecta are mainly dominated\nby evolutionary aspects (efficiency of mass-loss, third dredge-up, convection).\nFinally, we discuss how the LUNA results impact on the hypothesis that invokes\nmassive AGB stars as the main agents of the observed O-Na anti-correlation in\nGalactic globular clusters. We derive quantitative indications on the\nefficiencies of key physical processes (mass loss, third dredge-up, sodium\ndestruction) in order to simultaneously reproduce both the Na-rich, O-poor\nextreme of the anti-correlation, and the observational constraints on the CNO\nabundance. Results for the corresponding chemical ejecta are made publicly\navailable.\n", "  We present high sensitivity polarimetric observations in 6 bands covering the\n5.5-38 GHz range of a complete sample of 53 compact extragalactic radio sources\nbrighter than 200 mJy at 20 GHz. The observations, carried out with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), achieved a 91% detection rate (at 5\nsigma). Within this frequency range the spectra of about 95% of sources are\nwell fitted by double power laws, both in total intensity and in polarisation,\nbut the spectral shapes are generally different in the two cases. Most sources\nwere classified as either steep- or peaked-spectrum but less than 50% have the\nsame classification in total and in polarised intensity. No significant trends\nof the polarisation degree with flux density or with frequency were found. The\nmean variability index in total intensity of steep-spectrum sources increases\nwith frequency for a 4-5 year lag, while no significant trend shows up for the\nother sources and for the 8 year lag. In polarisation, the variability index,\nthat could be computed only for the 8 year lag, is substantially higher than in\ntotal intensity and has no significant frequency dependence.\n", "  We present new time-resolved photometry of 74 cataclysmic variables (CVs), 47\nof which are eclipsing. 13 of these eclipsing systems are newly discovered. For\nall 47 eclipsing systems we show high cadence (1-20 seconds) light curves\nobtained with the high-speed cameras ultracam and ultraspec. We provide new or\nrefined ephemerides, and supply mid-eclipse times for all observed eclipses. We\nassess the potential for light curve modelling of all 47 eclipsing systems to\ndetermine their system parameters, finding 20 systems which appear to be\nsuitable for future study.\n", "  We fitted the $3-180$-keV spectrum of all the observations of the\nneutron-star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636$-$53 taken with the {\\it Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer} using a model that includes a thermal Comptonisation\ncomponent. We found that in the low-hard state the power-law index of this\ncomponent, $\\Gamma$, gradually increases as the source moves in the\ncolour-colour diagram. When the source undergoes a transition from the hard to\nthe soft state $\\Gamma$ drops abruptly; once the source is in the soft state\n$\\Gamma$ increases again and then decreases gradually as the source spectrum\nsoftens further. The changes in $\\Gamma$, together with changes of the electron\ntemperature, reflect changes of the optical depth in the corona. The lower\nkilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (kHz QPO) in this source appears only in\nobservations during the transition from the hard to the soft state, when the\noptical depth of the corona is high and changes depends strongly upon the\nposition of the source in the colour-colour diagram. Our results are consistent\nwith a scenario in which the lower kHz QPO reflects a global mode in the system\nthat results from the resonance between, the disc and/or the neutron-star\nsurface, and the Comptonising corona.\n", "  Bulges of edge-on galaxies are often boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS), and unsharp\nmasks reveal the presence of an X shape. Simulations show that these shapes can\nbe produced by dynamical processes driven by a bar which vertically thickens\nthe centre. In the Milky Way, which contains such a B/PS bulge, the X-shaped\nstructure is traced by the metal-rich stars but not by the metal-poor ones.\nRecently Debattista et al. (2016) interpreted this property as a result of the\nvarying effect of the bar on stellar populations with different starting\nkinematics. This kinematic fractionation model predicts that cooler populations\nat the time of bar formation go on to trace the X shape, whereas hotter\npopulations are more uniformly distributed. As this prediction is not specific\nto the Milky Way, we test it with MUSE observations of the B/PS bulge in the\nnearby galaxy NGC 4710. We show that the metallicity map is more peanut-shaped\nthan the density distribution itself, in good agreement with the prediction.\nThis result indicates that the X-shaped structure in B/PS bulges is formed of\nrelatively metal-rich stars that have been vertically redistributed by the bar,\nwhereas the metal-poor stars have a more uniform, box-shaped distribution.\n", "  We calculate the energetic structure of defect cores and propose controlled\nmethods to imprint a nontrivially entangled vortex pair that undergoes\nnon-Abelian vortex reconnection in a biaxial nematic spin-2 condensate. For a\nsingular vortex, we find three superfluid cores in addition to depletion of the\ncondensate density. These exhibit order parameter symmetries that are different\nfrom the discrete symmetry of the biaxial nematic phase, forming an interface\nbetween the defect and the bulk superfluid. We provide a detailed analysis of\nphase mixing in the resulting vortex cores and find an instability dependent\nupon the orientation of the order parameter. We further show that the spin-2\ncondensate is a promising system for observing spontaneous deformation of a\npoint defect into an \"Alice ring\" that has so far avoided experimental\ndetection.\n", "  The number, distribution, and properties of dwarf satellites are crucial\nprobes of the physics of galaxy formation at low masses and the response of\nsatellite galaxies to the tidal and gas dynamical effects of their more massive\nparent.To make progress, it is necessary to augment and solidify the census of\ndwarf satellites of galaxies outside the Local Group. M\\\"uller et al. (2015)\npresented 16 dwarf galaxy candidates near M83, but lacking reliable distances,\nit is unclear which candidates are M83 satellites. Using red giant branch stars\nfrom the HST/GHOSTS survey in conjunction with ground-based images from\nVLT/VIMOS, we confirm that one of the candidates, dw1335-29-- with a projected\ndistance of 26 kpc from M83 and a distance modulus of $(m - M)_0 =\n28.5^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ -- is a satellite of M83. We estimate an absolute magnitude\n$M_V = -10.1 \\pm{0.4}$, an ellipticity of $0.40^{+0.14}_{-0.22}$, a half light\nradius of $656^{+121}_{-170 }$ pc, and [Fe/H] = $-1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$. Owing to\ndw1335-29's somewhat irregular shape and possible young stars, we classify this\ngalaxy as a dwarf irregular or transition dwarf. This is curious, as with a\nprojected distance of 26 kpc from M83, dw1335-29 is expected to lack recent\nstar formation. Further study of M83's dwarf population will reveal if star\nformation in its satellites is commonplace (suggesting a lack of a hot gas\nenvelope for M83 that would quench star formation) or rare (suggesting that\ndw1335-29 has a larger M83-centric distance, and is fortuitously projected to\nsmall radii).\n", "  Gravity is a non-linear theory, and hence, barring cancellations, the initial\nsuper-horizon perturbations produced by inflation must contain some minimum\namount of mode coupling, or primordial non-Gaussianity. In single-field\nslow-roll models, where this lower bound is saturated, non-Gaussianity is\ncontrolled by two observables: the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is uncertain\nby more than fifty orders of magnitude; and the scalar spectral index, or tilt,\nwhich is relatively well measured. It is well known that to leading and\nnext-to-leading order in derivatives, the contributions proportional to the\ntilt disappear from any local observable, and suspicion has been raised that\nthis might happen to all orders, allowing for an arbitrarily low amount of\nprimordial non-Gaussianity. Employing Conformal Fermi Coordinates, we show\nexplicitly that this is not the case. Instead, a contribution of order the tilt\nappears in local observables. In summary, the floor of physical primordial\nnon-Gaussianity in our Universe has a squeezed-limit scaling of\n$k_\\ell^2/k_s^2$, similar to equilateral and orthogonal shapes, and a\ndimensionless amplitude of order $0.1\\times(n_\\mathrm{s}-1)$.\n", "  New spectra of 81 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M7 and later) are\ndiscussed. Spectral classifications of 49 objects are available in the\nliterature, while 32 objects are newly classified. The known spectral types\nwere used to test an automated classification scheme, which relies primarily on\ntemplate fitting, supplemented by matching of spectral indices calibrated\nagainst the template spectra. An attempt was made to quantify the uncertainty\nin the spectral types, which is generally better than two subclasses. Objects\nfor which spectral types differ by more than one subclass from the literature\nclassifications are discussed individually. Discrepancies between automated\nclassifications based on respectively template fitting and spectral index\nmatching, may be useful for flagging objects with unusual spectra. Aside from\nthe 32 first-time classifications, alternative classifications are presented\nfor 32 previously classified dwarfs. Very large (equivalent width greater than\n130 \\AA) H$\\alpha$ flares are reported for the known ultracool dwarf binary\n2MASS J15200224$-$4422419; curiously, the object does not appear to have\nquiescent emission lines. Non-zero equivalent width measurements are listed for\na further 29 objects.\n", "  This is the second paper in our series about the search for multiple\npopulations in Magellanic Cloud star clusters using the Hubble Space Telescope.\nHere we report the detection of multiple stellar populations in the\ncolour-magnitude diagrams of the intermediate-age clusters Lindsay 1, NGC 416\nand NGC 339. With ages between 6.0 and 7.5 Gyr, these clusters are the youngest\nones in which chemical abundance spreads have been detected so far. This\nconfirms that the appearance of multiple populations is not restricted to only\nancient globular clusters, but may also be a common feature in clusters as\nyoung as 6 Gyr. Our results are in agreement with a recent spectroscopic study\nof Lindsay 1. We found that the fraction of enriched stars in NGC 416 is ~45%\nwhereas it is ~25% in NGC 339 and ~36% in Lindsay 1. Similar to NGC 121, these\nfractions are lower than the average value for globular clusters in the Milky\nWay.\n", "  The intracluster medium (ICM), as a magnetized and highly ionized fluid,\nprovides an ideal laboratory to study plasma physics under extreme conditions\nthat cannot yet be achieved on Earth. NGC 1404 is a bright elliptical galaxy\nthat is being gas stripped as it falls through the ICM of the Fornax Cluster.\nWe use the new {\\sl Chandra} X-ray observations of NGC 1404 to study ICM\nmicrophysics. The interstellar medium (ISM) of NGC 1404 is characterized by a\nsharp leading edge, 8 kpc from the galaxy center, and a short downstream\ngaseous tail. Contact discontinuities are resolved on unprecedented spatial\nscales ($0\\farcs5=45$\\,pc) due to the combination of the proximity of NGC 1404,\nthe superb spatial resolution of {\\sl Chandra}, and the very deep (670 ksec)\nexposure. At the leading edge, we observe sub-kpc scale eddies generated by\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability and put an upper limit of 5\\% Spitzer on the\nisotropic viscosity of the hot cluster plasma. We also observe mixing between\nthe hot cluster gas and the cooler galaxy gas in the downstream stripped tail,\nwhich provides further evidence of a low viscosity plasma. The assumed ordered\nmagnetic fields in the ICM ought to be smaller than 5\\,$\\mu$G to allow KHI to\ndevelop. The lack of evident magnetic draping layer just outside the contact\nedge is consistent with such an upper limit.\n", "  The new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low pathfinder), provides\nadvancements in our capability of probing Galactic magnetism through\nlow-frequency polarimetry. Maps of diffuse polarized radio emission and Faraday\nrotation can be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the\nmagnetic fields in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been\nprobed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a 5x5 degree\nregion centred on the nearby galaxy IC342 using LOFAR in the frequency range\n115-178 MHz at 4 arcmin resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect\nforeground Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth\n(different amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows rich\npolarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150 MHz. We\ndetect two overlapping diffuse polarized features that are clearly separated in\nFaraday depth. Faraday-thick structures at such low frequencies would be too\nstrongly depolarized to explain the observations and are therefore rejected.\nOnly Faraday thin structures will not be strongly depolarized; producing such\nstructures requires localized variations in the ratio of synchrotron emissivity\nto Faraday depth per unit distance, which can arise from several physical\nphenomena, such as a transition between regions of ionized and neutral gas. We\nconclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose that\nthe emission originates from two neutral clouds in the local ISM. We have\nmodeled the Faraday rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the line\nof sight component of magnetic field of the local ISM for this direction varies\nbetween -0.86 and +0.12 uG. We propose that this may be a useful method for\nmapping magnetic fields within the local ISM.\n", "  In many astrophysical settings covariance matrices of large datasets have to\nbe determined empirically from a finite number of mock realisations. The\nresulting noise degrades inference and precludes it completely if there are\nfewer realisations than data points. This work applies a recently proposed\nnon-linear shrinkage estimator of covariance to a realistic example from\nlarge-scale structure cosmology. After optimising its performance for the usage\nin likelihood expressions, the shrinkage estimator yields subdominant bias and\nvariance comparable to that of the standard estimator with a factor $\\sim 50$\nless realisations. This is achieved without any prior information on the\nproperties of the data or the structure of the covariance matrix, at negligible\ncomputational cost.\n", "  We have used the 610 MHz receivers of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope\n(GMRT) to detect associated HI 21cm absorption from the $z = 1.2230$ blazar\nTXS1954+513. The GMRT HI 21cm absorption is likely to arise against either the\nmilli-arcsecond-scale core or the one-sided milli-arcsecond-scale radio jet,\nand is blueshifted by $\\approx 328$ km s$^{-1}$ from the blazar redshift. This\nis consistent with a scenario in which the HI cloud giving rise to the\nabsorption is being driven outward by the radio jet. The integrated HI 21cm\noptical depth is $(0.716 \\pm 0.037)$ km s$^{-1}$, implying a high HI column\ndensity, $N_{\\rm HI} = (1.305 \\pm 0.067) \\times ({\\rm T_s/100\\: K}) \\times\n10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, for an assumed HI spin temperature of 100 K. We use Nickel\nTelescope photometry of TXS1954+513 to infer a high rest-frame 1216 \\AA\\\nluminosity of $(4.1 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. The $z = 1.2230$\nabsorber towards TXS1954+513 is only the fifth case of a detection of\nassociated HI 21cm absorption at $z > 1$, and is also the first case of such a\ndetection towards an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a rest-frame\nultraviolet luminosity $\\gg 10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, demonstrating that neutral\nhydrogen can survive in AGN environments in the presence of high ultraviolet\nluminosities.\n", "  We compare galaxy scaling relations as a function of environment at $z\\sim2$\nwith our ZFIRE survey where we have measured H$\\alpha$ fluxes for 90\nstar-forming galaxies selected from a mass-limited\n[$\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})>9$] sample based on ZFOURGE. The cluster galaxies\n(37) are part of a confirmed system at z=2.095 and the field galaxies (53) are\nat $1.9<z<2.4$; all are in the COSMOS legacy field. There is no statistical\ndifference between H$\\alpha$-emitting cluster and field populations when\ncomparing their star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_{\\star}$), galaxy\nsize ($r_{eff}$), SFR surface density [$\\Sigma$(H$\\alpha_{star}$)], and stellar\nage distributions. The only difference is that at fixed stellar mass, the\nH$\\alpha$-emitting cluster galaxies are $\\log(r_{eff})\\sim0.1$ larger than in\nthe field. Approximately 19% of the H$\\alpha$-emitters in the cluster and 26%\nin the field are IR-luminous ($L_{IR}>2\\times10^{11} L_{\\odot}$). Because the\nLIRGs in our combined sample are $\\sim5$ times more massive than the low-IR\ngalaxies, their radii are $\\sim70$% larger. To track stellar growth, we\nseparate galaxies into those that lie above, on, and below the H$\\alpha$\nstar-forming main sequence (SFMS) using $\\Delta$SFR$(M_{\\star})=\\pm0.2$ dex.\nGalaxies above the SFMS (starbursts) tend to have higher H$\\alpha$ SFR surface\ndensities and younger light-weighted stellar ages compared to galaxies below\nthe SFMS. Our results indicate that starbursts (+SFMS) in the cluster and field\nat $z\\sim2$ are growing their stellar cores. Lastly, we compare to the\n(SFR-$M_{\\star}$) relation from RHAPSODY cluster simulations and find the\npredicted slope is nominally consistent with the observations. However, the\npredicted cluster SFRs tend to be too low by a factor of $\\sim2$ which seems to\nbe a common problem for simulations across environment.\n", "  We study the antiferromagnetic and the paramagnetic Kondo insulator phases of\nthe Kondo lattice model on the cubic lattice at half-filling using the cellular\ndynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with numerical renormalization group (NRG)\nas the impurity solver, focusing on the fine details of the spectral function\nand self-energy. We find that the non-local correlations increase the gap in\nboth the antiferromagnetic and the Kondo insulator phase and shrink the extent\nof the antiferromagnetic phase in the phase diagram but do not alter any\nproperties qualitatively. The agreement between the numerical CDMFT results and\nthose within a simple hybridization picture, which adequately describes the\noverall band structure of the system but neglects all effects on the\ninelastic-scattering processes, is similar to that of the single-site DMFT\nresults; there are deviations that are responsible for the additional fine\nstructure, in particular for the asymmetric spectral resonances or dips that\nbecome more pronounced in the strong-coupling regime close to the\nantiferromagnet-paramagnetic quantum phase transition. These features appear\nbroader in the CDMFT mostly due to numerical artifacts linked to more\naggressive state truncation required in the NRG.\n", "  High resolution movies in 193 A from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\non the Solar Dynamic Observatory SDO show apparent rotation in the leg of a\nprominence observed during a coordinated campaign. Such structures are commonly\nreferred to as tornadoes. Time-distance intensity diagrams of the AIA data show\nthe existence of oscillations suggesting that the structure is rotating.\n  The aim of this paper is to understand if the cool plasma at chromospheric\ntemperatures inside the tornado is rotating around its central axis. The\ntornado was also observed in Halpha with a cadence of 30 seconds by the MSDP\nspectrograph, operating at the Solar Tower in Meudon. The MSDP provides\nsequences of simultaneous spectra in a 2D field of view from which a cube of\nDoppler velocity maps is retrieved.\n  The Halpha Doppler maps show a pattern with alternatively blueshifted and\nredshifted areas of 5 to 10 arcsec wide. Over time the blueshifted areas become\nredshifted and vice versa, with a quasi-periodicity of 40 to 60 minutes. Weaker\namplitude oscillations with periods of 4 to 6 minutes are superimposed onto\nthese large period oscillations.\n  The Doppler pattern observed in Halpha cannot be interpreted as rotation of\nthe cool plasma inside the tornado. The H$\\alpha$ velocity observations give\nstrong constraints on the possible interpretations of the AIA tornado\n", "  HD 141569 A is a pre-main sequence B9.5 Ve star surrounded by a prominent and\ncomplex circumstellar disk, likely still in a transition stage from\nprotoplanetary to debris disk phase. Here, we present a new image of the third\ninner disk component of HD 141569 A made in the L' band (3.8 micron) during the\ncommissioning of the vector vortex coronagraph recently installed in the\nnear-infrared imager and spectrograph NIRC2 behind the W.M. Keck Observatory\nKeck II adaptive optics system. We used reference point spread function\nsubtraction, which reveals the innermost disk component from the inner working\ndistance of $\\simeq 23$ AU and up to $\\simeq 70$ AU. The spatial scale of our\ndetection roughly corresponds to the optical and near-infrared scattered light,\nthermal Q, N and 8.6 micron PAH emission reported earlier. We also see an\noutward progression in dust location from the L'-band to the H-band (VLT/SPHERE\nimage) to the visible (HST/STIS image), likely indicative of dust blowout. The\nwarm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST\nNICMOS in 1999 (respectively at 406 and 245 AU). We fit our new L'-band image\nand spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer\ncode MCFOST. Our best-fit models favor pure olivine grains, and are consistent\nwith the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative\nvery-faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not\ndetect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the first\nouter ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.\n", "  An optical vortex coronagraph has been implemented within the NIRC2 camera on\nthe Keck II telescope and used to carry out on-sky tests and observations. The\ndevelopment of this new L'-band observational mode is described, and an initial\ndemonstration of the new capability is presented: a resolved image of the\nlow-mass companion to HIP79124, which had previously been detected by means of\ninterferometry. With HIP79124 B at a projected separation of 186.5 mas, both\nthe small inner working angle of the vortex coronagraph and the related imaging\nimprovements were crucial in imaging this close companion directly. Due to\nhigher Strehl ratios and more relaxed contrasts in L' band versus H band, this\nnew coronagraphic capability will enable high-contrast small-angle observations\nof nearby young exoplanets and disks on a par with those of shorter-wavelength\nextreme adaptive optics coronagraphs.\n", "  Examining a portion of the northern Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nfootprint, we detect at least three and possibly seven halo debris streams. One\nof these (PS1-D) was recently detected in the Pan-STARRS1 $3\\pi$ survey, and\nthe remaining two are also evident as extensions of the SDSS detections. All of\nthese streams are metal poor and are found at a distance of around $21 \\pm 5$\nkpc. The streams are between 65\\arcdeg~ and 70\\arcdeg~ in length, oriented\nalmost north-south, and are nearly parallel and somewhat convergent with the\nneighboring Orphan stream. Surface densities ranging from 1.5 to 0.5 stars per\nsquare degree down to $g = 21.7$ correspond to surface brightnesses between 35\nand 37 mag per square arcsecond. The streams each appear to be more than 300 pc\nacross, suggesting either dwarf/ultrafaint galaxy progenitors or long-term\nheating of very ancient globular cluster streams. The orbits of all but one of\nthese streams appear to be nearly radial, and the orbit normals suggest that\nall of the streams are part of the Vast Polar Structure, a relatively narrow\nplane that contains most of the known satellite galaxies, globular clusters,\nand stellar streams.\n", "  High resolution experiments have recently lead to a complete identification\n(energy, spin, and parity) of 151 nuclear levels up to an excitation Energy of\nEx= 6.20 MeV in 208Pb. We present a thorough study of the fluctuation\nproperties in the energy spectra of the unprecedented set of nuclear bound\nstates. In a first approach we grouped states with the same spin and parity\ninto 14 subspectra, analyzed standard statistical measures for short- and\nlong-range correlations and then computed their ensemble average. Their\ncomparison with a random matrix ensemble which interpolates between Poisson\nstatistics expected for regular systems and the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble\n(GOE) predicted for chaotic systems shows that the data are well described by\nthe GOE. In a second approach, following an idea of Rosenzweig and Porter we\nconsidered the complete spectrum composed of the independent subspectra. We\nanalyzed their fluctuation properties using the method of Bayesian inference\ninvolving a quantitative measure, called the chaoticity parameter f, which also\ninterpolates between Poisson (f=0) and GOE statistics (f=1). It turns out to be\nf~0.9. This is so far the closest agreement with GOE observed in spectra of\nbound states in a nucleus. The same analysis has also been performed with\nspectra computed on the basis of shell model calculations with different\ninteractions (SDI, KB, M3Y). While the simple SDI exhibits features typical for\nnuclear many-body systems with regular dynamics, the other, more realistic\ninteractions yield chaoticity parameters f close to the experimental values.\n", "  We study the vortex-bright solitons in a quasi-two-dimensional\nspin-orbit-coupled (SO-coupled) hyperfine spin-1 three-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) using variational method and numerical solution of a\nmean-field model. The ground state of these vortex-bright solitons is radially\nsymmetric for weak ferromagnetic and polar interactions. For a sufficiently\nstrong ferromagnetic interaction, we observe the emergence of an asymmetric\nvortex-bright soliton as the ground state. We also numerically investigate\nstable moving solitons and binary collision between them. The present\nmean-field model is not Galilean invariant, and we use a Galilean-transformed\nmodel for generating the moving solitons. At low velocities, the head-on\ncollision between two {\\em in-phase} solitons results either in collapse or\nfusion of the soliton pair. On the other hand, in head-on collision, the two\n{\\em out-of-phase} solitons strongly repel each other and trace back their\ntrajectories before the actual collision. At low velocities, in a collision\nwith an impact parameter, the {\\em out-of-phase} solitons get deflected from\ntheir original trajectory like two rigid classical disks. These {\\em\nout-of-phase solitons} behave like classical disks, and their collision\ndynamics is governed by classical laws of motion. However, at large velocities\ntwo SO-coupled spinor solitons, irrespective of phase difference, can pass\nthrough each other in a head-on collision like two quantum solitons.\n", "  We present the status of our ongoing calculation of the zero-recoil form\nfactor for the semileptonic decay $\\bar{B}^0\\rightarrow D^{*+}l^-\\bar{\\nu}$\nusing lattice QCD with 2+1+1 flavours of highly improved staggered quarks in\nthe sea (the MILC HISQ configurations) and using non-relativistic QCD for the\nbottom quark. We combine our result for $ F(1)$ with the latest HFAG average of\n$\\eta_{EW} F(1)|V_{cb}|$ to get a preliminary value for $|V_{cb}|$.\n", "  Under the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmological models,\nmassive galaxies are expected to be larger in denser environments through\nfrequent hierarchical mergers with other galaxies. Yet, observational studies\nof low-redshift early-type galaxies have shown no such trend, standing as a\npuzzle to solve during the past decade. We analyzed 73,116 early-type galaxies\nat $0.1\\leq z < 0.15$, adopting a robust nonparametric size measurement\ntechnique and extending the analysis to many massive galaxies. We find for the\nfirst time that local early-type galaxies heavier than $10^{11.2}M_{\\odot}$\nshow a clear environmental dependence in mass-size relation, in such a way that\ngalaxies are as much as 20-40% larger in densest environments than in\nunderdense environments. Splitting the sample into the brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCGs) and non-BCGs does not affect the result. This result agrees\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations and suggests that mergers played\na significant role in the growth of massive galaxies in dense environments as\nexpected in theory.\n", "  The N-dimensional radial Schrodinger equation with an extended Cornell\npotential is solved. The analytical exact iteration method is applied. The\nenergy eigenvalues are calculated in the N-dimensional space. The charmonium\nmeson, the bottomonium meson and the bc meson masses are calculated in the\nN-dimensional space. The special cases are obtained from the general case. The\nstudy of the effect of dimensionality number is studied. The mean value of the\nradius and the mean square velocity of charmonium meson, bottomonium meson, and\nbc meson are calculated. The present results are improved in comparison with\nother recent studies and are in good agreement with the experimental data.\nTherefore, the present method with the present potential gives successfully\ndescription of heavy quarkonium properties.\n", "  In this work we continue our effort to explore a recent proposal, which\nallows light-cone distributions to be extracted from purely spatial\ncorrelations, being thus accessible to lattice methods. In order to test the\nfeasibility of this method, we present our latest results from a twisted mass\nlattice calculation of the flavor non-singlet momentum, helicity and\ntransversity distributions of the nucleon. Furthermore, we apply a newly\nproposed momentum improved smearing, which has the potential to reach higher\nnucleon momenta as required for a safe matching procedure to the physical\ndistribution functions.\n", "  The laboratory gas phase spectrum recently published by Campbell et al. has\nreinvigorated attempts to confirm the presence of the C$_{60}^+$ cation in the\ninterstellar medium, thorough an analysis of the spectra of hot, reddened\nstars. This search is hindered by at least two issues that need to be\naddressed: (i) the wavelength range of interest is severely polluted by strong\nwater- vapour lines coming from the Earth's atmosphere; (ii) one of the major\nbands attributed to C$_{60}^+$, at 9633 \\AA, is blended with the stellar Mg{\\sc\nii} line, which is susceptible to non-local-thermodynamic equilibrium effects\nin hot stellar atmospheres. Both these issues are here carefully considered\nhere for the first time, based on high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nratio echell\\'e spectra for 19 lines of sight. The result is that the presence\nof C$_{60}^+$ in interstellar clouds is brought into question.\n", "  The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is a Chinese\nmega-science project funded by the National Development and Reform Commission\n(NDRC) of the People's Republic of China. The National Astronomical\nObservatories of China (NAOC) is in charge of its construction and subsequent\noperation. Upon its expected completion in September 2016, FAST will surpass\nthe 300-meter Arecibo Telescope and the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope in terms\nof absolute sensitivity in the 70 MHz to 3 GHz bands. In this paper, we report\non the project, its current status, the key science goals, and plans for early\nscience.\n", "  The program {\\sc Duo} (Yurchenko {\\it et al.}, Computer Phys. Comms., 202\n(2016) 262) provides direct solutions of the nuclear motion Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for the (coupled) potential energy curves of open shell diatomic\nmolecules. Wavefunctions from {\\sc Duo} are used to compute Land\\'e $g$-factors\nvalid for weak magnetic fields, the results are compared with the idealized\npredictions of both Hund's case (a) and Hund's case (b) coupling schemes. Test\ncalculations are performed for AlO, NO, CrH and C$_2$. The computed $g_J$'s\nboth provide a sensitive test of the underlying spectroscopic model used to\nrepresent the system and an indication of whether states of the molecule are\nwell-represented by the either of the Hund's cases considered. The computation\nof Land\\'e $g$-factors is implemented as a standard option in the latest\nrelease of {\\sc Duo}.\n", "  We introduce a cryptographically motivated quantifier of entanglement in\nbipartite Gaussian systems called Gaussian intrinsic entanglement (GIE). The\nGIE is defined as the optimized mutual information of a Gaussian distribution\nof outcomes of measurements on parts of a system, conditioned on the outcomes\nof a measurement on a purifying subsystem. We show that GIE vanishes only on\nseparable states and exhibits monotonicity under Gaussian local\ntrace-preserving operations and classical communication. In the two-mode case\nwe compute GIE for all pure states as well as for several important classes of\nsymmetric and asymmetric mixed states. Surprisingly, in all of these cases, GIE\nis equal to Gaussian R\\'{e}nyi-2 entanglement. As GIE is operationally\nassociated to the secret-key agreement protocol and can be computed for several\nimportant classes of states it offers a compromise between computable and\nphysically meaningful entanglement quantifiers.\n", "  Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely\nused in enzyme simulation. Over ten convergence studies of QM/MM methods have\nrevealed over the past several years that key energetic and structural\nproperties approach asymptotic limits with only very large (ca. 500-1000 atom)\nQM regions. This slow convergence has been observed to be due in part to\nsignificant charge transfer between the core active site and surrounding\nprotein environment, which cannot be addressed by improvement of MM force\nfields or the embedding method employed within QM/MM. Given this slow\nconvergence, it becomes essential to identify strategies for the most\natom-economical determination of optimal QM regions and to gain insight into\nthe crucial interactions captured only in large QM regions. Here, we extend and\ndevelop two methods for quantitative determination of QM regions. First, in the\ncharge shift analysis (CSA) method, we probe the reorganization of electron\ndensity when core active site residues are removed completely, as determined by\nlarge-QM region QM/MM calculations. Second, we introduce the\nhighly-parallelizable Fukui shift analysis (FSA), which identifies how\ncore/substrate frontier states are altered by the presence of an additional QM\nresidue on smaller initial QM regions. We demonstrate that the FSA and CSA\napproaches are complementary and consistent on three test case enzymes:\ncatechol O-methyltransferase, cytochrome P450cam, and hen eggwhite lysozyme. We\nalso introduce validation strategies and test sensitivities of the two methods\nto geometric structure, basis set size, and electronic structure methodology.\nBoth methods represent promising approaches for the systematic, unbiased\ndetermination of quantum mechanical effects in enzymes and large systems that\nnecessitate multi-scale modeling.\n", "  We present evidence for the existence of a quantum lower bound on the\nBekenstein-Hawking temperature of black holes. The suggested bound is supported\nby a gedanken experiment in which a charged particle is dropped into a Kerr\nblack hole. It is proved that the temperature of the final Kerr-Newman\nblack-hole configuration is bounded from below by the relation\n$T_{\\text{BH}}\\times r_{\\text{H}}>(\\hbar/r_{\\text{H}})^2$, where $r_{\\text{H}}$\nis the horizon radius of the black hole.\n", "  The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)\nrepresent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond\nlocalization (~ 100mas precision) of FRB121102 using the VLA has led to its\nunambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to\nthe identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise\nlocalization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship\nbetween the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent\nemission. Here we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations\nusing the European VLBI Network and the 305-m Arecibo telescope, which\nsimultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at\nmilliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a\nprojected linear separation of < 40pc (< 12mas angular separation, at 95%\nconfidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and\npersistent radio source (~ 2-4mas at 1.7GHz), which are both similar to the\nexpected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a\nprojected size constrained to be < 0.7pc (< 0.2mas angular extent at 5.0GHz)\nand a lower limit for the brightness temperature of T_b > 5 x 10^7K. Together,\nthese observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between\nFRB121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source\nassociated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron\nstar energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB121102 that\nbest match the observed data.\n", "  The precise localization of the repeating fast radio burst (FRB 121102) has\nprovided the first unambiguous association (chance coincidence probability\n$p\\lesssim3\\times10^{-4}$) of an FRB with an optical and persistent radio\ncounterpart. We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart\nand find that it is an extended ($0.6^{\\prime\\prime}-0.8^{\\prime\\prime}$)\nobject displaying prominent Balmer and [OIII] emission lines. Based on the\nspectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a\nlow-metallicity, star-forming, $m_{r^\\prime} = 25.1$ AB mag dwarf galaxy at a\nredshift of $z=0.19273(8)$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc.\nFrom the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host\ngalaxy to have a diameter $\\lesssim4$ kpc and a stellar mass of\n$M_*\\sim4-7\\times 10^{7}\\,M_\\odot$, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to\n3$\\,M_\\odot\\,L_\\odot^{-1}$. Based on the H$\\alpha$ flux, we estimate the star\nformation rate of the host to be $0.4\\,M_\\odot\\,\\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ and a\nsubstantial host dispersion measure depth $\\lesssim 324\\,\\mathrm{pc\\,cm^{-3}}$.\nThe net dispersion measure contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is\nlikely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show\nthat the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote\net al (2017) is offset from the galaxy's center of light by $\\sim$200 mas and\nthe host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB\n121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric\nlocalizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities\nand prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long\ngamma ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.\n", "  We apply cross correlation between multichannel seismic waveforms as a\ntechnique for signal detection and automatic event building at the\nInternational Data Centre (IDC). This technique allows detecting signals with\namplitudes by at least a factor of two lower than those found in the current\nversion of IDC processing. Previously, we processed with a cross correlation\ndetector aftershock sequences of a large earthquake with thousands of\naftershocks detected by the International Monitoring System (IMS) and a\nmiddle-size earthquake (hundreds of aftershocks). Our study has revealed that\nthe official Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) of the IDC misses from 50% to 70%\nvalid seismic events. Since the IDC is a major contributor to the International\nSeismological Centre (ISC) these extra events together with the associated\narrivals are missing from the ISC bulletin which is an open data source for the\nbroader seismological and geophysical community.Here, we assess the ultimate\nresolution of the cross correlation technique with specific IDC constraints.\nThe aftershock sequence of the October 5, 2011 mb(IDC)4.2 earthquake in the\nNorth Atlantic is an example of a weak sequence and includes only 38 REB\nevents. The number and quality of these REB events, which are used as master\nevents, allow conducting a comprehensive interactive review by experienced\nanalysts of all event hypotheses obtained by the cross correlation technique.\nIn an iterative procedure starting from the main shock, all 38 REB events were\nfound and analysts added 26 REB events. Therefore, the cross correlation\npipeline reduces the detection threshold by a factor of 2 to 3 and\napproximately doubles the number of events in the REB, and thus, in the ISC\nbulletin for the North Atlantic.\n", "  We introduce a simpler although unconventional minimal subtraction\nrenormalization procedure in the case of a massive scalar $\\lambda \\phi^{4}$\ntheory in Euclidean space using dimensional regularization. We show that this\nmethod is very similar to its counterpart in massless field theory. In\nparticular, the choice of using the bare mass at higher perturbative order\ninstead of employing its tree-level counterpart eliminates all tadpole\ninsertions at that order. As an application, we compute diagrammatically the\ncritical exponents $\\eta$ and $\\nu$ at least up to two loops. We perform an\nexplicit comparison with the Bogoliubov-Parasyuk-Hepp-Zimmermann ($BPHZ$)\nmethod at the same loop order, show that the proposed method requires fewer\ndiagrams and establish a connection between the two approaches.\n", "  On the largest scales, the Universe consists of voids and filaments making up\nthe cosmic web. Galaxy clusters are located at the knots in this web, at the\nintersection of filaments. Clusters grow through accretion from these\nlarge-scale filaments and by mergers with other clusters and groups. In a\ngrowing number of galaxy clusters, elongated Mpc-size radio sources have been\nfound, so-called radio relics. These relics are thought to trace relativistic\nelectrons in the intracluster plasma accelerated by low-Mach number\ncollisionless shocks generated by cluster-cluster merger events. A\nlong-standing problem is how low-Mach number shocks can accelerate electrons so\nefficiently to explain the observed radio relics. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of a direct connection between a radio relic and a radio galaxy in\nthe merging galaxy cluster Abell 3411-3412. This discovery indicates that\nfossil relativistic electrons from active galactic nuclei are re-accelerated at\ncluster shocks. It also implies that radio galaxies play an important role in\ngoverning the non-thermal component of the intracluster medium in merging\nclusters.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a semi-simple Lie algebra. For a $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued\n1-form $A$, consider the Yang-Mills action \\begin{equation} S_{YM}(A) =\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} \\left|dA + A \\wedge A \\right|^2 \\nonumber \\end{equation}\nusing the standard metric on $T\\mathbb{R}^4$. Using axial gauge fixing, we want\nto make sense of the following path integral, \\begin{equation} {\\rm Tr}\\\n\\int_{A \\in \\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbb{R}^4, \\mathfrak{g}} /\\mathcal{G}} \\mathcal{T}\n\\exp \\left[ \\int_{C} A\\right] e^{-\\frac{1}{2}S_{YM}(A)}\\ DA, \\nonumber\n\\end{equation} whereby $DA$ is some Lebesgue type of measure on the space of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-forms, modulo gauge transformations\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathbb{R}^4, \\mathfrak{g}} /\\mathcal{G}$. Here $\\mathcal{T}$ is\nthe time ordering operator.\n  We will construct an Abstract Wiener space for which we can define the\nYang-Mills path integral rigorously, both in the Abelian and non-Abelian cases.\nSubsequently, we will then derive the Wilson Area Law formula, in both the\nAbelian and non-Abelian cases from these definitions. One of the most important\napplications of the Area Law formula will be to explain why the potential\nmeasured between a quark and antiquark is a linear potential.\n", "  Strong X-ray and $\\gamma$--ray flares have been detected in February 2010\nfrom the high synchrotron peaked blazar Mrk 421 (z=0.031). With the motivation\nof understanding the physics involved in this flaring activity, we study the\nvariability of the source in X-ray and $\\gamma$--ray energy bands during the\nperiod February 10-23, 2010 (MJD 55237-55250). We use near simultaneous X-ray\ndata collected by \\emph{MAXI}, \\emph{Swift}-XRT and $\\gamma$--ray data\ncollected by \\emph{Fermi}-LAT and \\emph{TACTIC} along with the optical V-band\nobservations by \\emph{SPOL} at Steward Observatory. We observe that the\nvariation in the one day averaged flux from the source during the flare is\ncharacterized by fast rise and slow decay. Besides, the TeV $\\gamma$--ray flux\nshows a strong correlation with the X-ray flux, suggesting the former to be an\noutcome of synchrotron self Compton emission process. To model the observed\nX-ray and $\\gamma$--ray light curves, we numerically solve the kinetic equation\ndescribing the evolution of particle distribution in the emission region. The\ninjection of particle distribution into the emission region, from the putative\nacceleration region, is assumed to be a time dependent power law. The\nsynchrotron and synchrotron self Compton emission from the evolving particle\ndistribution in the emission region are used to reproduce the X-ray and\n$\\gamma$--ray flares successfully. Our study suggests that the flaring activity\nof Mrk 421 can be an outcome of an efficient acceleration process associated\nwith the increase in underlying non-thermal particle distribution.\n", "  The projection factor p is the key quantity used in the Baade-Wesselink (BW)\nmethod for distance determination; it converts radial velocities into pulsation\nvelocities. Several methods are used to determine p, such as geometrical and\nhydrodynamical models or the inverse BW approach when the distance is known. We\nanalyze new HARPS-N spectra of delta Cep to measure its cycle-averaged\natmospheric velocity gradient in order to better constrain the projection\nfactor. We first apply the inverse BW method to derive p directly from\nobservations. The projection factor can be divided into three subconcepts: (1)\na geometrical effect (p0); (2) the velocity gradient within the atmosphere\n(fgrad); and (3) the relative motion of the optical pulsating photosphere with\nrespect to the corresponding mass elements (fo-g). We then measure the fgrad\nvalue of delta Cep for the first time. When the HARPS-N mean cross-correlated\nline-profiles are fitted with a Gaussian profile, the projection factor is\npcc-g = 1.239 +/- 0.034(stat) +/- 0.023(syst). When we consider the different\namplitudes of the radial velocity curves that are associated with 17 selected\nspectral lines, we measure projection factors ranging from 1.273 to 1.329. We\nfind a relation between fgrad and the line depth measured when the Cepheid is\nat minimum radius. This relation is consistent with that obtained from our best\nhydrodynamical model of delta Cep and with our projection factor decomposition.\nUsing the observational values of p and fgrad found for the 17 spectral lines,\nwe derive a semi-theoretical value of fo-g. We alternatively obtain fo-g =\n0.975+/-0.002 or 1.006+/-0.002 assuming models using radiative transfer in\nplane-parallel or spherically symmetric geometries, respectively. The new\nHARPS-N observations of delta Cep are consistent with our decomposition of the\nprojection factor.\n", "  We present the first density model of Stromboli volcano (Aeolian Islands,\nItaly) obtained by simultaneously inverting land-based (543) and sea-surface\n(327) relative gravity data. Modern positioning technology, a 1 * 1 m digital\nelevation model, and a 15 * 15 m bathymetric model made it possible to obtain a\ndetailed 3-D density model through an iteratively reweighted\nsmoothness-constrained least-squares inversion that explained the land-based\ngravity data to 0.09 mGal and the sea-surface data to 5 mGal. Our inverse\nformulation avoids introducing any assumptions about density magnitudes. At 125\nm depth from the land surface, the inferred mean density of the island is 2380\nkg m-3, with corresponding 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of 2200 and 2530 kg m-3.\nThis density range covers the rock densities of new and previously published\nsamples of Paleostromboli I, Vancori, Neostromboli and San Bartolo lava flows.\nHigh-density anomalies in the central and southern part of the island can be\nrelated to two main degassing faults crossing the island (N41 and N64) that are\ninterpreted as preferential regions of dyke intrusions. In addition, two\nlow-density anomalies are found in the northeastern part and in the summit area\nof the island. These anomalies seem to be geographically related with past\nparoxysmal explosive phreato-magmatic events that have played important roles\nin the evolution of Stromboli Island by forming the Scari caldera and the\nNeostromboli crater, respectively.\n", "  We designed, fabricated and tested short one dimensional arrays of masked\nion-irradiated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ Josephson junctions (JJ) embedded into\nlog-periodic spiral antennas. Our arrays consist of 4 or 8 junctions separated\neither by 960~nm or 80~nm long areas of undamaged YBCO. Samples with distanced\njunctions and with closely spaced junctions showed qualitatively different\nbehaviors. Well separated arrays demonstrated giant Shapiro steps in the\nhundreds-GHz band at 66K and were tested as Josephson mixers with improved\nimpedance matching. All closely spaced arrays behaved as one junction with a\nlower superconducting transition temperature, hence forming a single weak link\non distances up to 880~nm. Such design opens a new way to increase the\nI$_{c}$R$_{N}$ product of ion-irradiated junctions and we speculate that the\nphenomena and physics behind it might be similar to the so-called \"giant\"\nJosephson coupling observed in cuprates.\n", "  We use very deep spectra obtained with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle\nSpectrograph in the Very Large Telescope in order to determine the physical\nconditions, the chemical abundances and the iron depletion factors of four H II\nregions of the Large Magellanic Cloud and four H II regions of the Small\nMagellanic Cloud. The spectral range covered is 3100-10400 $\\mathring{A}$ with\na resolution of $\\Delta\\lambda \\sim \\lambda / 8800$. We measure the intensity\nof up to 200 emission lines in each object. Electron temperature and electron\ndensity are determined using different line intensity ratios. The ionic and\ntotal abundances are derived using collisionally excited lines for O, N, S, Cl,\nNe, Ar, and Fe. The uncertainties are calculated using Monte Carlo simulations.\nThis is the largest available set of high quality spectra for H II regions in\nthe Magellanic Clouds. Thus, we can derive chemical abundances and depletion\nfactors and constrain their variations across each galaxy with better accuracy\nthan previous studies. In particular, we find that the amount of Fe depleted on\nto dust grains in the H II regions of the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that\nfound in Galactic H II regions.\n", "  Solute clusters affect the physical properties of alloys. Knowledge of the\natomic structure of solute clusters is a prerequisite for material\noptimisation. In this study, solute clusters in a rapid-hardening Al-Cu-Mg\nalloy were characterised by a combination of atom probe tomography and density\nfunctional theory, making use of a hybrid data type that combines lattice\nrectification and data completion to directly input experimental data into\natomistic simulations. The clusters input to the atomistic simulations are thus\nobserved experimentally, reducing the number of possible configurations. Our\nresults show that spheroidal, compact clusters are more energetically\nfavourable and more abundant.\n", "  Negative index materials are artificial structures whose refractive index has\nnegative value over some frequency range. The study of these materials has\nattracted a lot of attention in the scientific community not only because of\ntheir many potential interesting applications but also because of challenges in\nunderstanding their intriguing properties due to the sign-changing coefficients\nin equations describing their properties. In this paper, we establish cloaking\nusing complementary media for electromagnetic waves. This confirms and extends\nthe suggestions in two dimensions of Lai et al. for the full Maxwell equations.\nThe analysis is based on the reflecting and removing localized singularity\ntechniques, three-sphere inequalities, and the fact that the Maxwell equations\ncan be reduced to a weakly coupled second order elliptic equations.\n", "  We analyse test particle's trajectories around the geometry of a\nSchwarzschild black hole. In order to resemble sections of jets in the\nneighborhood of a black hole, we consider the conserved quantities\ncorresponding to constraints imposed on the trajectories of the test particles,\nnamely conic and hyperboloidic trajectories. As expected, the energy and\nangular momentum are closely related to the solutions in the non-constrained\ncase.\n", "  A rail-mounted synthetic aperture radar has been constructed to operate at\nW-band (75 - 110 GHz) and a THz band (325 - 500 GHz) in order to ascertain its\nability to locate isolated small, visually obscured metallic scatterers\nembedded in highly scattering dielectric hosts that are either semi-transparent\nor opaque. A top view 2D algorithm was used to reconstruct scenes from the\nacquired data, locating metallic scatterers at W-band with high range and\ncross-range resolution of 4.3 and 2 mm, respectively, and with improved range\nresolution of 0.86 mm at the THz band. Millimeter-sized metallic scatterers\nwere easily located when embedded in semi-transparent, highly scattering target\nhosts of Styrofoam and waxy packing foam but were more difficult to locate when\nembedded in relatively opaque, highly scattering Celotex panels. Although the\nTHz band provided the expected greater spatial resolution, it required the\ntarget to be moved closer to the rail and had a more limited field of view that\nprevented some targets from being identified. Techniques for improving the\nsignal to noise ratio are discussed. This work establishes a path for\ndeveloping techniques to render a complete 3D reconstruction of a scene.\n", "  Casimir forces are of fundamental interest because they originate from\nquantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Apart from controlling the\nCasimir force via the optical properties of the materials, a number of novel\ngeometries have been proposed to generate repulsive and/or non-monotonic\nCasimir forces between bodies separated by vacuum gaps. Experimental\nrealization of these geometries, however, is hindered by the difficulties in\nalignment when the bodies are brought into close proximity. Here, using an\non-chip platform with integrated force sensors and actuators, we circumvent the\nalignment problem and measure the Casimir force between two surfaces with\nnanoscale protrusions. We demonstrate that the Casimir force depends\nnon-monotonically on the displacement. At some displacements, the Casimir force\nleads to an effective stiffening of the nanomechanical spring. Our findings\npave the way for exploiting the Casimir force in nanomechanical systems using\nstructures of complex and non-conventional shapes.\n", "  Evidence-based teaching is based upon a model of learning in which assessment\nplays a central role.\n", "  Propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) from their sources to the observer is\ndescribed mainly as plain diffusion at high energies, while at lower energies\nthere are other physical processes involved, both in the interstellar space and\nin the heliosphere. The latter was a subject of considerable uncertainty until\nrecently. New data obtained by several CR missions can be used to and the local\ninterstellar spectra (LIS) of CR species that would significantly reduce the\nuncertainties associated with the heliospheric propagation. In this paper we\npresent the LIS of CR protons and helium outside the heliospheric boundary. The\nproposed LIS are tuned to accommodate both, the low energy CR spectra measured\nby Voyager 1, and the high energy observations publicly released by BESS,\nPamela, AMS-01 and AMS-02. The proton and helium LIS are derived by combining\nCR propagation in the Galaxy, as described by GALPROP, with the heliospheric\nmodulation computed using the HelMod Monte Carlo Tool. The proposed LIS are\ntuned to reproduce the modulated spectra for both, high and low, levels of\nsolar activity.\n", "  We discuss propagation of traveling waves in a blood filled elastic artery\nwith an axially symmetric dilatation (an idealized aneurysm). The processes in\nthe injured artery are modelled by equations for the motion of the wall of the\nartery and by equation for the motion of the fluid (the blood). For the case\nwhen long-wave approximation holds the model equations are reduced to a version\nof the perturbed Korteweg-deVries equation. Exact travelling-wave solutions of\nthis equation are obtained by the modified method of simplest equation where\nthe differential equation of Abel is used as a simplest equation. A particular\ncase of the obtained exact solution is discussed from the point of view of\narterial mechanics.\n", "  Ocean wave energy is a new renewable energy resource which is going to become\none of the reliable and alternative resources for fossil fuels during recent\ndecades. The majority of studies have focused on extract wave energy at an\neffective rate; whilst, there are a few studies to explore the hydrodynamic of\nwave and surge wave energy converters. In this study a 2D numerical model based\non RANS equations is closured with SST turbulence model employed to simulate\nthe hydrodynamic of the flap type wave energy devices. The results indicate\nthat a partially standing wave induced by the interaction of incident and\nreflected waves occurs in front of device due to its rotating movements.\n", "  Per weight graphene is stronger than steel, but because graphene is so thin,\nit breaks and evidently forms cracks during handling, particularly when\nsupporting polymers are not used for transfer. In this paper, the parameter\nrupture index is introduced to quantify the density of the cracks and related\ndefects in graphene during processing. The approach takes the advantages of the\nhigh contrast achievable in fluorescence quenching microscopy to distinguish\nbetween graphene and the background substrate, visible through the cracks in\ngraphene. The rupture index can well compare the effectiveness of different\ngraphene transferring methods in minimizing the formation of the cracks, and\nquantify the oxidation of metals protected with graphene.\n", "  We introduce a novel modality in the CVD growth of graphene which combines\nthe cold-wall and hot-wall reaction chambers. This hybrid mode preserves the\nadvantages of a cold-wall chamber as the fast growth and low fuel consumption,\nbut boosts the quality of the growth towards conventional CVD with hot-wall\nchambers. The synthesized graphene is uniform and monolayer. The electronic\ntransport measurements shows great improvements in charge carrier mobility\ncompared to graphene synthesized in a normal cold-wall reaction chamber. Our\nresults promise the development of a fast and cost-efficient growth of high\nquality graphene, suitable for scalable industrial applications.\n", "  Modeling potential alloys requires the exploration of all possible\nconfigurations of atoms. Additionally, modeling the thermal properties of\nmaterials requires knowledge of the possible ways of displacing the atoms. One\nsolution to finding all symmetrically unique configurations and displacements\nis to generate the complete list of possible configurations and remove those\nthat are symmetrically equivalent. This approach, however, suffers from the\ncombinatorial explosion that happens when the supercell size is large, when\nthere are more than two atom types, or when there are multiple displaced atoms.\nThis problem persists even when there are only a relatively small number of\nunique arrangements that survive the elimination process. Here, we extend an\nexisting algorithm\\cite{enum1,enum2,enum3} to include the extra configurational\ndegree of freedom from the inclusion of displacement directions. The algorithm\nuses group theory to eliminate large classes of configurations, avoiding the\ncombinatoric explosion. With this approach we can now enumerate previously\ninaccessible systems, including atomic displacements.\n", "  Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate interactions between autonomous agents in\nconstrained environments over time. ABMs are often used for modeling the spread\nof infectious diseases. In order to simulate disease outbreaks or other\nphenomena, ABMs rely on \"synthetic ecosystems,\" or information about agents and\ntheir environments that is representative of the real world. Previous\napproaches for generating synthetic ecosystems have some limitations: they are\nnot open-source, cannot be adapted to new or updated input data sources, and do\nnot allow for alternative methods for sampling agent characteristics and\nlocations. We introduce a general framework for generating Synthetic\nPopulations and Ecosystems of the World (SPEW), implemented as an open-source R\npackage. SPEW allows researchers to choose from a variety of sampling methods\nfor agent characteristics and locations when generating synthetic ecosystems\nfor any geographic region. SPEW can produce synthetic ecosystems for any agent\n(e.g. humans, mosquitoes, etc), provided that appropriate data is available. We\nanalyze the accuracy and computational efficiency of SPEW given different\nsampling methods for agent characteristics and locations and provide a suite of\ndiagnostics to screen our synthetic ecosystems. SPEW has generated over five\nbillion human agents across approximately 100,000 geographic regions in about\n70 countries, available online.\n", "  The Renyi entropy plays an essential role in quantum information theory. We\nstudy the continuity estimation of the Renyi entropy. An inequality relating\nthe Renyi entropy difference of two quantum states to their trace norm distance\nis derived. This inequality is shown to be tight in the sense that equality can\nbe attained for every prescribed value of the trace norm distance. It includes\nthe sharp Fannes inequality for von Neumann entropy as a special case.\n", "  We calculate the thermal conductivity (\\k{appa}) of both bulk crystalline and\nsingle-chain polyethylene (PE) using the first-principles-based anharmonic\nlattice dynamics. Despite its low \\k{appa} in amorphous state, the predicted\nbulk crystal has high axial \\k{appa} (237 W/m-K) at room temperature. The much\nlower measured \\k{appa} is attributed to the small size of nanocrystallites\n(~10 nm) in synthesized semi-crystalline PE. For the 1-D chain, the predicted\n\\k{appa} is much larger and yet finite (1400 W/m-K at room temperature). The\nreduction of scattering phase space caused by the diminished interchain van der\nWaals interactions explains this larger \\k{appa}. It is also found that the\ntransverse phonon branches with quadratic dispersion make minor contribution to\nthis, due to their vanishing group velocity in the long-wavelength limit.\nMoreover, the low-frequency bending and twisting phonon modes are strongly\ncoupled and dominate anharmonic phonon scatterings, leading to the finite\n\\k{appa}. The predicted high \\k{appa} of bulk and chain PE crystals enable\npolymer usage in thermal management and the above phonon scatterings provide\nguide for their nano-designs.\n", "  Incommensurately modulated twin structure of nyerereite Na1.64K0.36Ca(CO3)2\nhas been first determined in the (3+1)D symmetry group Cmcm({\\alpha}00)00s with\nmodulation vector q = 0.383a*. Unit-cell values are a = 5.062(1), b = 8.790(1),\nc = 12.744(1) {\\AA}. Three orthorhombic components are related by threefold\nrotation about [001]. Discontinuous crenel functions are used to describe\noccupation modulation of Ca and some CO3 groups. Strong displacive modulation\nof the oxygen atoms in vertexes of such CO3 groups is described using\nx-harmonics in crenel intervals. The Na, K atoms occupy mixed sites whose\noccupation modulation is described by two ways using either complementary\nharmonic functions or crenels. The nyerereite structure has been compared both\nwith commensurately modulated structure of K-free Na2Ca(CO3)2 and with widely\nknown incommensurately modulated structure of {\\gamma}-Na2CO3.\n", "  As a continuation to the published work on model based calibration technique\nwith HESP(Hanle Echelle Spectrograph) as a case study, in this paper we present\nthe performance results of the technique. We also describe how the open\nparameters were chosen in the model for optimization, the glass data accuracy\nand handling the discrepancies. It is observed through simulations that the\ndiscrepancies in glass data can be identified but not quantifiable. So having\nan accurate glass data is important which is possible to obtain from the glass\nmanufacturers. The model's performance in various aspects is presented using\nthe ThAr calibration frames from HESP during its pre-shipment tests. Accuracy\nof model predictions and its wave length calibration comparison with\nconventional empirical fitting, the behaviour of open parameters in\noptimization, model's ability to track instrumental drifts in the spectrum and\nthe double fibres performance were discussed. It is observed that the optimized\nmodel is able to predict to a high accuracy the drifts in the spectrum from\nenvironmental fluctuations. It is also observed that the pattern in the\nspectral drifts across the 2D spectrum which vary from image to image is\npredictable with the optimized model. We will also discuss the possible science\ncases where the model can contribute.\n", "  We study the adsorption of charged patchy particle models (CPPMs) on a thin\nfilm of a like-charged and dense polyelectrolyte (PE) brush (of 50 monomers per\nchain) by means of implicit-solvent, explicit-salt Langevin dynamics computer\nsimulations. Our previously introduced set of CPPMs embraces well-defined one-,\nand two-patched spherical globules, each of the same net charge and (nanometer)\nsize, with mono- and multipole moments comparable to those of small globular\nproteins. We focus on electrostatic effects on the adsorption far away from the\nisoelectric point of typical proteins, i.e., where charge regulation plays no\nrole. Despite the same net charge of the brush and globule we observe large\nbinding affinities up to tens of the thermal energy, kT, which are enhanced by\ndecreasing salt concentration and increasing charge of the patch(es). Our\nanalysis of the distance-resolved potentials of mean force together with a\nphenomenological description of all leading interaction contributions shows\nthat the attraction is strongest at the brush surface, driven by multipolar,\nBorn (self-energy), and counterion-release contributions, dominating locally\nover the monopolar and steric repulsions.\n", "  A plethora of different morphologies are fabricated by the self assembly of\nmolybdenum disulphide (MoS2) exfoliated flakes with the help of\nLangmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique at the liquid/air interface. The MoS2 flakes\nare chemically exfoliated in various solvents but their stable sheet like\nassembly on substrate is achieved only in case of the flakes exfoliated in\ndimethylformamide. The density of the monolayer sheets is finely controlled by\nthe surface pressure while the stabilization of MoS2 LB film onto the water\nsubphase results in its self assembly into diffusion limited cluster aggregates\nand fractals. We further demonstrate the effect of excitation on the emission\nof LB assembled MoS2 sheets which reveals the existence of a new exciton\ncorresponding to 2.43 eV apart from the direct bandgap emission at 1.86 eV.\nFinally, field effect transistors are fabricated on SiO2/Si and a mobility of\n7.4 cm2V-1s-1 with a current on-off ratio of 10^5 is obtained. This work\nprovides a new approach for the systematic deposition of the solution processed\nexfoliated flakes on large scale as well as formation of pattern structures in\na natural way.\n", "  When immiscible liquids are subject to electric fields interfacial forces\narise due to a difference in the permittivity or the conductance of the\nliquids, and these forces lead to shape change in droplets or to interfacial\ninstabilities. In this Topical Review we discuss recent advances in the theory\nand experiments of liquids in electric fields with an emphasis on liquids which\nare initially miscible and demix under the influence of an external field. In\npurely dielectric liquids demixing occurs if the electrode geometry leads to\nsufficiently large field gradients. In polar liquids field gradients are\nprevalent due to screening by dissociated ions irrespective of the electrode\ngeometry. We examine the conditions for these \"electro prewetting\" transitions\nand highlight few possible systems where they might be important, such as in\nstabilization of colloids and in gating of pores in membranes.\n", "  The attenuation function S(t) for an ensemble of spins in a magnetic-field\ngradient is calculated by accumulation of the phase shifts in the rotating\nframe resulting from the displacements of spin-bearing particles. The found\nS(t), expressed through the particle mean square displacement, is applicable\nfor any kind of stationary stochastic motion of spins, including their\nnon-markovian dynamics with memory. The known expressions valid for normal and\nanomalous diffusion are obtained as special cases in the long time\napproximation. The method is also applicable to the NMR pulse sequences based\non the refocusing principle. This is demonstrated by describing the Hahn spin\necho experiment. The attenuation of the NMR signal is also evaluated providing\nthat the random motion of particle is modeled by the generalized Langevin\nequation with the memory kernel exponentially decaying in time.\n", "  We investigate, both theoretically and numerically, a graphene-coated\nnano-cylinder illuminated by a plane electromagnetic wave in THz range of\nfrequencies. We have derived an analytical formula that enables fast evaluation\nof the spectral window with a substantial reduction in scattering efficiency\nfor sufficiently thin cylinder. This effect leads to tunable resonant\ninvisibility that can be achieved via modification of graphene chemical\npotential monitored by the gate voltage. A multi-frequency cloaking mechanism\nbased on dimer coated nanowires is also discussed.\n", "  Recent several experiments revealed that novel bipartite\nmagnetic/superconducting phases widely exist in iron pnictides and\nchalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome superconducting phases\nin iron-based compounds still remains unclear. Here we theoretically\ninvestigated the electronic structures, magnetic and superconducting properties\nof three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO1-xHx, LaFeAs1-xPxO and\nKFe2As2. We found that in addition to the degenerate in-plane anisotropic xz/yz\norbitals, the quasi-degenerate in-plane isotropic orbitals drive these systems\nentering into the second parent phase. Moreover, the second superconducting\nphase is contributed by the isotropic orbitals rather than the anisotropic ones\nin the first superconducting phase, indicating an orbital-selective pairing\nstate. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism and shed light on the\nunderstanding of the two-dome magnetic/superconducting phases in iron-based\ncompounds.\n", "  We investigate the impact velocity beyond which the ejection of smaller\ndroplets from the main droplet (splashing) occurs for droplets impacting a\nsmooth surface. We examine its dependence on the surface wetting properties and\ndroplet surface tension. We show that the splashing velocity is independent of\nthe wetting properties of the surface, but increases roughly linearly with\nincreasing surface tension of the liquid. A preexisting splashing model is\nconsidered that predicts the splashing velocity by incorporating the air\nviscosity. The model is consistent with our data, but the calculation is\ncomplex. To address this issue, we propose a simplification, assuming\natmospheric conditions and low viscosities, and show that the simplification\ngives an equally good prediction of the splashing velocity from a simple\nanalytical formula.\n", "  M31, our closest neighboring galaxy, is a stepping stone to studies of\nstellar evolution, star formation, galaxy evolution, and cosmology. However,\ndue to the difficulties of performing photometry in such crowded fields and the\nlack of wide cameras to encompass the entire galaxy, there has not been a\ncomplete census of the stellar contents of M31. The advent of wide-field camera\nprovides us a unique opportunity to have a complete view of our neighboring\ngalaxy, enabling an inventory of its variable content. We present a review of\nrecent progresses of wide-field, high cadence surveys of M31, covering\ndifferent population of variables and transients. We also outline future\nstudies enabled by on-going and up-coming facilities.\n", "  For a non-relativistic particle, we consider the evolution of wave functions\nthat consist of polynomial segments, usually joined smoothly together. These\nspline wave functions are compact (that is, they are initially zero outside a\nfinite region), but they immediately extend over all available space as they\nevolve. The simplest splines are the square and triangular wave functions in\none dimension, but very complicated splines have been used in physics. In\ngeneral the evolution of such spline wave functions can be expressed in terms\nof antiderivatives of the propagator; in the case of a free particle or an\noscillator, all the evolutions are expressed exactly in terms of Fresnel\nintegrals. Some extensions of these methods to two and three dimensions are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The rare radiative decays $ B_s^0\\rightarrow l^+ l^-\\gamma $ $ (l=\\mu,\\tau) $\nare important probes for testing the flavor sector of the standard model (SM)\nand possible extensions. We investigate the effects of non-universal $Z'$ boson\non the $ B_s^0\\rightarrow l^+ l^-\\gamma $ decays which can give significant\nbasis to verify the new physics (NP) contributions. The $Z'$ boson gives\nadditional contributions to the Wilson coefficients $ C_9 $ and $ C_{10} $ due\nto its coupling with leptons and quarks. The coupling parameters of $Z'$ boson\nare constrained from $ B-\\bar{B} $ mixing and different inclusive as well as\nexclusive decays of \\emph{B} meson. We include these contributions to calculate\nthe branching ratios and forward-backward asymmetries $ (A_{FB}) $ for $\nB_s^0\\rightarrow l^+ l^-\\gamma $ $ (l=\\mu,\\tau) $ decay modes, which segregate\nnew physics (NP) effects. We find that the branching ratios are enhanced by one\norder from SM results. We also see the variation of $ A_{FB} $ with the\ncoupling parameters which distinguishes between NP effects and SM results.\n", "  Geoelectrical techniques are widely used to monitor groundwater processes,\nwhile surprisingly few studies have considered audio (AMT) and radio (RMT)\nmagnetotellurics for such purposes. In this numerical investigation, we analyze\nto what extent inversion results based on AMT and RMT monitoring data can be\nimproved by (1) time-lapse difference inversion; (2) incorporation of\nstatistical information about the expected model update (i.e., the model\nregularization is based on a geostatistical model); (3) using alternative model\nnorms to quantify temporal changes (i.e., approximations of l1 and Cauchy norms\nusing iteratively reweighted least-squares), (4) constraining model updates to\npredefined ranges (i.e., using Lagrange Multipliers to only allow either\nincreases or decreases of electrical resistivity with respect to background\nconditions). To do so, we consider a simple illustrative model and a more\nrealistic test case related to seawater intrusion. The results are encouraging\nand show significant improvements when using time-lapse difference inversion\nwith non l2 model norms. Artifacts that may arise when imposing compactness of\nregions with temporal changes can be suppressed through inequality constraints\nto yield models without oscillations outside the true region of temporal\nchanges. Based on these results, we recommend approximate l1-norm solutions as\nthey can resolve both sharp and smooth interfaces within the same model.\n", "  ESASky is a science-driven discovery portal to explore the multi-wavelength\nsky and visualise and access multiple astronomical archive holdings. The tool\nis a web application that requires no prior knowledge of any of the missions\ninvolved and gives users world-wide simplified access to the highest-level\nscience data products from multiple astronomical space-based astronomy missions\nplus a number of ESA source catalogues. The first public release of ESASky\nfeatures interfaces for the visualisation of the sky in multiple wavelengths,\nthe visualisation of query results summaries, and the visualisation of\nobservations and catalogue sources for single and multiple targets. This paper\ndescribes these features within ESASky, developed to address use cases from the\nscientific community. The decisions regarding the visualisation of large\namounts of data and the technologies used were made in order to maximise the\nresponsiveness of the application and to keep the tool as useful and intuitive\nas possible.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries remain crucial objects for our understanding of the\nuniverse. In particular, those that are components of multiple systems can help\nus solve the problem of the formation of these systems. Analysis of the radial\nvelocities together with the light curve produced for the first time precise\nphysical parameters of the components of the multiple systems V773 Cas, QS Aql,\nand BR Ind. Their visual orbits were also analyzed, which resulted in slightly\nimproved orbital elements. What is typical for all these systems is that their\nmost dominant source is the third distant component. The system V773 Cas\nconsists of two similar G1-2V stars revolving in a circular orbit and a more\ndistant component of the A3V type. Additionally, the improved value of parallax\nwas calculated to be 17.6 mas. Analysis of QS Aql resulted in the following:\nthe inner eclipsing pair is composed of B6V and F1V stars, and the third\ncomponent is of about the B6 spectral type. The outer orbit has high\neccentricity of about 0.95, and observations near its upcoming periastron\npassage between the years 2038 and 2040 are of high importance. Also, the\nparallax of the system was derived to be about 2.89 mas, moving the star much\ncloser to the Sun than originally assumed. The system BR Ind was found to be a\nquadruple star consisting of two eclipsing K dwarfs orbiting each other with a\nperiod of 1.786 days; the distant component is a single-lined spectroscopic\nbinary with an orbital period of about 6 days. Both pairs are moving around\neach other on their 148 year orbit.\n", "  Probabilistic inversion methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nsimulation are well suited to quantify parameter and model uncertainty of\nnonlinear inverse problems. Yet, application of such methods to CPU-intensive\nforward models can be a daunting task, particularly if the parameter space is\nhigh dimensional. Here, we present a two-dimensional (2D) pixel-based MCMC\ninversion of plane-wave electromagnetic (EM) data. Using synthetic data, we\ninvestigate how model parameter uncertainty depends on model structure\nconstraints using different norms of the likelihood function and the model\nconstraints, and study the added benefits of joint inversion of EM and\nelectrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. Our results demonstrate that\nmodel structure constraints are a necessity to stabilize the MCMC inversion\nresults of a highly-discretized model. These constraints decrease model\nparameter uncertainty and facilitate model interpretation. A drawback is that\nthese constraints may lead to posterior distributions that do not fully include\nthe true underlying model, because some of its features exhibit a low\nsensitivity to the EM data, and hence are difficult to resolve. This problem\ncan be partly mitigated if the plane-wave EM data is augmented with ERT\nobservations. The hierarchical Bayesian inverse formulation introduced and used\nherein is able to successfully recover the probabilistic properties of the\nmeasurement data errors and a model regularization weight. Application of the\nproposed inversion methodology to field data from an aquifer demonstrates that\nthe posterior mean model realization is very similar to that derived from a\ndeterministic inversion with similar model constraints.\n", "  An improved understanding of turbulence is essential for the effective\nmodelling and control of industrial and geophysical processes. Homogeneous,\nisotropic turbulence (HIT) is the archetypal field for developing turbulence\nphysics theory. Based on the Schur transform, we introduce an additive\ndecomposition of the velocity gradient tensor into a normal part (containing\nthe eigenvalues) and a non-normal or shear-related tensor. We re-interrogate\nsome key properties of HIT and show that the the tendency of the flow to form\ndisc-like structures is not a property of the normal tensor; it emerges from an\ninteraction with the non-normality. Also, the alignment between the vorticity\nvector and the second eigenvector of the strain tensor is another consequence\nof local shear processes.\n", "  The available photometry mainly from the WASP database was used for the first\nlight curve analysis of eight eclipsing binary systems located in the Lyncis\nconstellation: RV Lyn, AA Lyn, AH Lyn, CD Lyn, CF Lyn, DR Lyn, EK Lyn, and FS\nLyn. Most of these eclipsing stars are detached ones, having the orbital\nperiods from 0.54 to 2.3 days. For the systems AA Lyn and CF Lyn a\nnon-negligible third light was detected during the light curve solution.\nMoreover, 284 new times of minima for these binaries were derived, trying to\nidentify the period variations. For the system CD Lyn a hypothetical third body\nwas detected with the period of about 59 yr.\n", "  It is said about quantum interference that \"In reality, it contains the only\nmystery\". Indeed, together with non-locality it is often considered as the\ncharacteristic feature of quantum theory which can not be explained in any\nclassical way. In this work we are concerned with a restricted setting of a\nsingle particle propagating in multi-path interferometric circuits, that is\nphysical realisation of a qudit. It is shown that this framework, including\ncollapse of the wave function, can be simulated with classical resources\nwithout violating the locality principle. We present a local ontological model\nwhose predictions are indistinguishable from the quantum case. 'Non-locality'\nin the model appears merely as an epistemic effect arising on the level of\ndescription by agents whose knowledge is incomplete. This result suggests that\nthe real quantum mystery should be sought in the multi-particle behaviour,\nsince single-particle interferometric phenomena are explicable in a classical\nmanner.\n", "  Viruses are incapable of autonomous energy production. Although many\nexperimental studies make it clear that viruses are parasitic entities that\nhijack the host's molecular resources, a detailed estimate for the energetic\ncost of viral synthesis is largely lacking. To quantify the energetic cost of\nviruses to their hosts, we enumerated the costs associated with two very\ndistinct but representative DNA and RNA viruses, namely T4 and influenza. We\nfound that for these viruses, translation of viral proteins is the most\nenergetically expensive process. Interestingly, the cost of building a T4 phage\nand a single influenza virus are nearly the same. Due to influenza's higher\nburst size, however, the overall cost of a T4 phage infection is only 2-3% of\nthe cost of an influenza infection. The costs of these infections relative to\ntheir host's estimated energy budget during the infection reveal that a T4\ninfection consumes about a third of its host's energy budget, where as an\ninfluenza infection consumes only 1%. Building on our estimates for T4, we show\nhow the energetic costs of double-stranded DNA viruses scale with virus size,\nrevealing that the dominant cost of building a virus can switch from\ntranslation to genome replication above a critical virus size. Lastly, using\nour predictions for the energetic cost of viruses, we provide estimates for the\nstrengths of selection and genetic drift acting on newly incorporated genetic\nelements in viral genomes, under conditions of energy limitation.\n", "  The incompressible three-dimensional ideal flows develop very thin\npancake-like regions of increasing vorticity. These regions evolve with the\nscaling $\\omega_{\\max}(t)\\propto\\ell(t)^{-2/3}$ between the vorticity maximum\nand pancake thickness, and provide the leading contribution to the energy\nspectrum, where the gradual formation of the Kolmogorov interval $E_{k}\\propto\nk^{-5/3}$ is observed for some initial flows [Agafontsev et. al, Phys. Fluids\n27, 085102 (2015)]. With the massive numerical simulations, in the present\npaper we study the influence of initial conditions on the processes of pancake\nformation and the Kolmogorov energy spectrum development.\n", "  Electron energy filtering has been suggested as a promising way to improve\nthe power factor and enhance the ZT figure of merit of thermoelectric\nmaterials. In this work we explore the effect that reduced dimensionality has\non the success of the energy-filtering mechanism for power factor enhancement.\nWe use the quantum mechanical non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method\nfor electron transport including electron-phonon scattering to explore 1D and\n2D superlattice/nanocomposite systems. We find that, given identical material\nparameters, 1D channels utilize energy filtering more effectively than 2D as\nthey: i) allow one to achieve maximal power factor for smaller well sizes /\nsmaller grains (which is needed to maximize phonon scattering), ii) take better\nadvantage of a lower thermal conductivity in the barrier/boundary materials\ncompared to the well/grain materials in both: enhancing the Seebeck\ncoefficient; and in producing a system which is robust against detrimental\nrandom deviations from optimal barrier design. In certain cases we find that\nthe relative advantage can be as high as a factor of 3. We determine that\nenergy-filtering is most effective when the average energy of carrier flow\nvaries the most in the wells and the barriers along the channel, an event which\nappears when the energy of the carrier flow in the host material is low and\nwhen the energy relaxation mean-free-path of carriers is short. Although the\nultimate reason these aspects, which cause a 1D system to see greater relative\nimprovement than a 2D, is the 1D system's van Hove singularity in the\ndensity-of-states, the insights obtained are general and inform\nenergy-filtering design beyond dimensional considerations.\n", "  This paper provides a brief overview of dynamo scaling relationships for the\ndegree of equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energies. Three basic\napproaches are adopted to explore these scaling relationships, with a first\nlook at two simple models: one assuming magnetostrophy and another that\nincludes the effects of inertia. Next, a third scaling relationship is derived\nthat utilizes the assumptions that the dynamo possesses two integral spatial\nscales and that it is driven by the balance of buoyancy work and ohmic\ndissipation as studied in Davidson 2013. The results of which are then compared\nto a suite of convective dynamo simulations that possess a fully convective\ndomain with a weak density stratification and that captured the behavior of the\nresulting dynamo for a range of convective Rossby numbers (Augustson et al.\n2016).\n", "  Using GL no scattering full wave modeling and inversion, we create a GLHUA\npre cloak electromagnetic (EM) material in the virtual sphere that makes the\nsphere is invisible. The invisible sphere is called GLHUA sphere. In GLHUA\nsphere, the Pre cloak relative parameter is not less than 1; the parameters and\ntheir derivative are continuous across the boundary r=R2 and the parameters are\ngoing to infinity at origin r=0. The phase velocity of EM wave in the sphere is\nless than light speed and going to zero at origin. The EM wave field excited in\nthe outside of the sphere can not be disturbed by GLHUA sphere. By GL full wave\nmethod, we rigorously proved the incident EM wave field excited in outside of\nGLHUA sphere and propagation through the sphere without any scattering by the\nsphere, the total EM field in outside of the sphere equal to the incident wave\nfield. Moreover, we prove that in GLHUA sphere with the pre cloak material,\nwhen r is going to origin, EM wave field propagation in GLHUA sphere is going\nto zero. All copyright and patent of the GLHUA EM cloaks,GLHUA sphere and GL\nmodeling and inversion methods are reserved by authors in GL Geophysical\nLaboratory.\n", "  In this paper, we derive a lubrication model to describe the non-stationary\nfree liquid film that is created when a vertical frame is pulled out of a\nliquid reservoir at a given velocity. We here focus on the case of a pure\nliquid, corresponding to a stress-free boundary condition at the liquid/air\ninterfaces of the film, and thus employ an essentially extensional description\nof the flow. Taking into account van der Waals interactions between the\ninterfaces, we observe that film rupture is well-defined in time as well as in\nspace, which allows us to compute the critical thickness and the film height at\nthe moment of rupture. The theoretical predictions of the model turn out to be\nin quantitative agreement with experimental measurements of the break-up height\nof silicone oil films in a wide range of pulling velocities and supporting\nfiber diameters.\n", "  Collective behaviors of populations of coupled oscillators have attracted\nmuch attention in recent years. In this paper, an order parameter approach is\nproposed to study the low-dimensional dynam- ical mechanism of collective\nsynchronizations by adopting the star-topology of coupled oscillators as a\nprototype system. The order parameter equation of star-linked phase oscillators\ncan be obtained in terms of the Watanabe-Strogatz transformation, Ott-Antonsen\nansatz, and the ensemble order parameter approach. Different solutions of the\norder parameter equation correspond to diverse col- lective states, and\ndifferent bifurcations reveal various transitions among these collective\nstates. The properties of various transitions are revealed in the star-network\nmodel by using tools of nonlinear dynamics such as time reversibility analysis\nand linear stability analysis.\n", "  Composite materials comprised of ferroelectric nanoparticles in a dielectric\nmatrix are being actively investigated for a variety of functional properties\nattractive for a wide range of novel electronic and energy harvesting devices.\nHowever, the dependence of these functionalities on shapes, sizes, orientation\nand mutual arrangement of ferroelectric particles is currently not fully\nunderstood. In this study, we utilize a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach\ncombined with coupled-physics finite-element-method based simulations to\nelucidate the behavior of polarization in isolated spherical PbTiO3 or BaTiO3\nnanoparticles embedded in a dielectric medium, including air. The equilibrium\npolarization topology is strongly affected by particle diameter, as well as the\nchoice of inclusion and matrix materials, with monodomain, vortex-like and\nmultidomain patterns emerging for various combinations of size and materials\nparameters. This leads to radically different polarization vs electric field\nresponses, resulting in highly tunable size-dependent dielectric properties\nthat should be possible to observe experimentally. Our calculations show that\nthere is a critical particle size below which ferroelectricity vanishes. For\nthe PbTiO3 particle, this size is 2 and 3.4 nm, respectively, for high- and\nlow-permittivity media. For the BaTiO3 particle, it is ~3.6 nm regardless of\nthe medium dielectric strength.\n", "  An alternative voting scheme is proposed to fill the democratic gap between a\npresident elected democratically via universal suffrage (deterministic outcome,\nthe actual majority decides), and a president elected by one person randomly\nselected from the population (probabilistic outcome depending on respective\nsupports). Moving from one voting agent to a group of r randomly selected\nvoting agents reduces the probabilistic character of the outcome. Building r\nsuch groups, each one electing its president, to constitute a group of the\ngroups with the r local presidents electing a higher-level president, does\nreduce further the outcome probabilistic aspect. Repeating the process n times\nleads to a n-level bottom-up pyramidal structure. The hierarchy top president\nis still elected with a probability but the distance from a deterministic\noutcome reduces quickly with increasing n. At a critical value n_{c,r} the\noutcome turns deterministic recovering the same result a universal suffrage\nwould yield. The scheme yields several social advantages like the distribution\nof local power to the competing minority making the structure more resilient,\nyet preserving the presidency allocation to the actual majority. An area is\nproduced around fifty percent for which the president is elected with an almost\nequiprobability slightly biased in favor of the actual majority. However, our\nresults reveal the existence of a severe geometric vulnerability to lobbying. A\ntiny lobbying group is able to kill the democratic balance by seizing the\npresidency democratically. It is sufficient to complete a correlated\ndistribution of a few agents at the hierarchy bottom. Moreover, at the present\nstage, identifying an actual killing distribution is not feasible, which sheds\na disturbing light on the devastating effect geometric lobbying can have on\ndemocratic hierarchical institutions.\n", "  As telescopes become larger, into the era of ~40 m Extremely Large\nTelescopes, the high- resolution vertical profile of the optical turbulence\nstrength is critical for the validation, optimization and operation of optical\nsystems. The velocity of atmospheric optical turbulence is an important\nparameter for several applications including astronomical adaptive optics\nsystems. Here, we compare the vertical profile of the velocity of the\natmospheric wind above La Palma by means of a comparison of\nStereo-SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (Stereo- SCIDAR) with the Global\nForecast System models and nearby balloon-borne radiosondes. We use these data\nto validate the automated optical turbulence velocity identification from the\nStereo-SCIDAR instrument mounted on the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma.\nBy comparing these data we infer that the turbulence velocity and the wind\nvelocity are consistent and that the automated turbulence velocity\nidentification of the Stereo-SCIDAR is precise. The turbulence velocities can\nbe used to increase the sensitivity of the turbulence strength profiles, as\nweaker turbulence that may be misinterpreted as noise can be detected with a\nvelocity vector. The turbulence velocities can also be used to increase the\naltitude resolution of a detected layer, as the altitude of the velocity\nvectors can be identified to a greater precision than the native resolution of\nthe system. We also show examples of complex velocity structure within a\nturbulent layer caused by wind shear at the interface of atmospheric zones.\n", "  We study the transport of thermally excited non-equilibrium magnons through\nthe ferrimagnetic insulator YIG using two electrically isolated Pt strips as\ninjector and detector. The diffusing magnons induce a non- local inverse spin\nHall voltage in the detector corresponding to the so-called non-local spin\nSeebeck effect (SSE). We measure the non-local SSE as a function of temperature\nand strip separation. In experiments at room temperature we observe a sign\nchange of the non-local SSE voltage at a characteristic strip separation d0, in\nagreement with previous investigations. At lower temperatures however, we find\na strong temperature dependence of d0. This suggests that both the angular\nmomentum transfer across the YIG/Pt interface as well as the transport\nmechanism of the magnons in YIG as a function of temperature must be taken into\naccount to describe the non-local spin Seebeck effect.\n", "  The \\emph{Relativistic Schr\\\"odinger Theory} (RST) has been set up as an\nalternative form of particle theory. This theory obeys the fundamental\nsymmetries which are required to hold for any meaningful theory: gauge and\nLorentz covariance (RST can be formulated even over a pseudo-Riemannian\nspace-time). But the question is now whether obeying those fundamental\nsymmetries is sufficient for the practical success of a theory, i.e. whether\nthe predictions are in agreement with the experimental findings. In this\ncontext, the non-relativistic energy spectrum of positronium has been\nconsidered in some precedent papers. Here, the problem is that exact solutions\nof the RST eigenvalue system cannot be obtained and one has to resort to\napproximate solutions. For this purpose, a variational method is applied in the\npresent paper which yields the RST groundstate energy smaller than the former\nresults and than its conventional counterpart by some 10\\%. Such deviations are\nalso observed when one compares the approximate RST spectrum (up to quantum\nnumbers $n\\approx 100$) to the corresponding predictions of the conventional\ntheory. It seems presently not possible to decide whether those deviations are\ndue to RST itself or are merely due to the applied approximation technique.\nThus the practical usefulness of RST must remain unclarified for the moment.\n", "  The unique Higgs physics opportunities accessible at the CERN Future Circular\nCollider (FCC) in electron-positron ($\\sqrt{s}$ = 125, 240, 350 GeV) and\nproton-proton ($\\sqrt{s}$ = 100 TeV) collisions, are succinctly summarized.\nThanks to the large c.m. energies and enormous luminosities (plus clean\nexperimental conditions in the $e^+e^-$ case), many open fundamental aspects of\nthe Higgs sector of the Standard Model (SM) can be experimentally studied: (i)\nMeasurement of the Higgs Yukawa couplings to the lightest fermions: u,d,s\nquarks (via rare exclusive $H\\to(\\rho,\\omega,\\phi)+\\gamma$ decays); and e$^\\pm$\n(via resonant s-channel $e^+e^-\\to H$ production); as well as neutrinos (within\nlow-scale seesaw mass generation scenarios); (ii) Measurement of the Higgs\npotential (triple $\\lambda_3$, and quartic $\\lambda_4$ self-couplings), via\ndouble and triple Higgs boson production in pp collisions at 100 TeV; (iii)\nSearches for new physics coupled to the scalar SM sector at scales $\\Lambda>$ 6\nTeV, thanks to measurements of the Higgs boson couplings with subpercent\nuncertainties in $e^+e^-\\to H\\,Z$; and (iv) Searches for dark matter in\nHiggs-portal interactions, via high-precision measurements of on-shell and\noff-shell Higgs boson invisible decays. All these measurements are beyond the\nreach of pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. New higher-energy $e^+e^-$\nand pp colliders such as FCC are thus required to complete our understanding of\nthe full set of SM Higgs parameters, as well as to search for new\nscalar-coupled physics in the multi-TeV regime.\n", "  According to a traditional point of view Boltzmann entropy is intimately\nrelated to linear Fokker-Planck equations (Smoluchowski, Klein-Kramers, and\nRayleigh equations) that describe a well-known nonequilibrium phenomenon:\n(normal) Brownian motion of a particle immersed in a thermal bath.\nNevertheless, current researches have claimed that non-Boltzmann entropies\n(Tsallis and Renyi entropies, for instance) may give rise to anomalous Brownian\nmotion through nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations. The novelty of the present\narticle is to show that anomalous diffusion could be investigated within the\nframework of non-Markovian linear Fokker-Planck equations. So on the ground of\nthis non-Markovian approach to Brownian motion, we find out anomalous diffusion\ncharacterized by the mean square displacement of a free particle and a harmonic\noscillator in absence of inertial force as well as the mean square momentum of\na free particle in presence of inertial force.\n", "  Realization of integrated photonic circuits on a single chip requires\ncontrolled manipulation and integration of solid-state quantum emitters with\nnanophotonic components. Previous works focused on emitters embedded in a\nthree-dimensional crystals -- such as nanodiamonds or quantum dots. In\ncontrast, in this work we demonstrate coupling of a single emitter in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) material, namely hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with a\ntapered optical fiber and find a collection efficiency of the system is found\nto be 10~\\%. Furthermore, due to the single dipole character of the emitter, we\nwere able to analyse the angular emission pattern of the coupled system via\nback focal plane imaging. The good coupling efficiency to the tapered fiber\neven allows excitation and detection in a fully fiber coupled way yielding a\ntrue integrated system. Our results provide evidence of the feasibility to\nefficiently integrate quantum emitters in 2D materials with photonic\nstructures.\n", "  Non-reciprocal devices, with one-way transport properties, form a key\ncomponent for isolating and controlling light in photonic systems.\nOptomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical\nnon-reciprocity, due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity\nsymmetry in the system. Here we consider how the non-reciprocal behavior of\nlight can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices. We\nfocus on the case of a quasi one dimensional optical ring resonator with many\nmechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of\ndisorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material,\nlargely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise\nphonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high\nquality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of\ndisorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with\ndirection-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the\nphase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory\nconnects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the\nassociated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental\nresults.\n", "  We fabricate electric double-layer field-effect transistor (EDL-FET) devices\non mechanically exfoliated few-layer graphene. We exploit the large capacitance\nof a polymeric electrolyte to study the transport properties of three, four and\nfive-layer samples under a large induced surface charge density both above and\nbelow the glass transition temperature of the polymer. We find that the carrier\nmobility shows a strong asymmetry between the hole and electron doping regime.\nWe then employ ab-initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations to\ndetermine the average scattering lifetime from the experimental data. We\nexplain its peculiar dependence on the carrier density in terms of the specific\nproperties of the electrolyte we used in our experiments.\n", "  We describe and summarize the findings from our CCD time-series photometry of\nglobular clusters (GCs) program and the use of difference image analysis (DIA)\nin the extraction of very precise light curves even in the crowded central\nregions down to $V\\sim 19$ mag. We have discovered approximately 250 variable\nstars in a sample of 23 selected GCs and have, therefore, updated the census of\nvariables in each system and in some cases we have actually completed it down\nto a certain magnitude. The absolute magnitude and [Fe/H] for each individual\nRR Lyrae is obtained via the Fourier decomposition of the light curve. An\naverage of these parameters leads to the distance and metallicity of the host\nGCs. We have also calibrated the P-L relation for SX Phe stars which enables an\nindependent calculation of the cluster distance. We present the mean [Fe/H],\n$M_V$ and distance for a group of selected GCs based exclusively on the RR\nLyrae light curve Fourier decomposition technique and set on a rather\nunprecedented homogeneous scale. We also discuss the luminosity dependence of\nthe horizontal branch (HB) via the $M_V$-[Fe/H] relation. We find that this\nrelation should be considered separately for the RRab and RRc stars.\n", "  We test the proposed 3-component spectral model for neutron star low mass\nX-ray binaries using broad-band X-ray data. We have analysed 4 X-ray spectra\n(0.8-30 keV) obtained with Suzaku during the 2010 outburst of 4U 1608-52, which\nhave allowed us to perform a comprehensive spectral study covering all the\nclassical spectral states. We use a thermally Comptonized continuum component\nto account for the hard emission, as well as two thermal components to\nconstrain the accretion disc and neutron star surface contributions. We find\nthat the proposed combination of multicolor disc, single-temperature black body\nand Comptonization components successfully reproduces the data from soft to\nhard states. In the soft state, our study supports the neutron star surface (or\nboundary layer) as the dominant source for the Comptonization seed photons\nyielding the observed weak hard emission, while in the hard state both\nsolutions, either the disc or the neutron star surface, are equally favoured.\nThe obtained spectral parameters as well as the spectral/timing correlations\nare comparable to those observed in accreting black holes, which support the\nidea that black hole and neutron star low mass X-ray binaries undergo a similar\nstate evolution during their accretion episodes.\n", "  Macroevolution is considered as a problem of stochastic dynamics in a system\nwith many competing agents. Evolutionary events (speciations and extinctions)\nare triggered by fitness records found by random exploration of the agents'\nfitness landscapes. As a consequence, the average fitness in the system\nincreases logarithmically with time, while the rate of extinction steadily\ndecreases. This dynamics is studied by numerical simulations and, in a simpler\nmean field version, analytically. We also study the effect of externally added\n`mass' extinctions. The predictions for various quantities of paleontological\ninterest (life-time distributions, distribution of event sizes and behavior of\nthe rate of extinction) are robust and in good agreement with available data.\nBrief version of parts of this work have been published as Letters. (PRL 75,\n2055, (1995) and PRL, 79, 1413, (1997))\n", "  We study the solutions of the gap equation, the thermodynamic potential and\nthe chiral susceptibility in and beyond the chiral limit at finite chemical\npotential in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We give an explicit relation\nbetween the chiral susceptibility and the thermodynamic potential in the NJL\nmodel. We find that the chiral susceptibility is a quantity being able to\nrepresent the furcation of the solutions of the gap equation and the\nconcavo-convexity of the thermodynamic potential in NJL model. It indicates\nthat the chiral susceptibility can identify the stable state and the\npossibility of the chiral phase transition in NJL model.\n"]}
