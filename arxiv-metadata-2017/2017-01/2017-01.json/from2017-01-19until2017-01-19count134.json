Ultra-low energy thresholds are important in\nthe detection of low-energy nuclear recoils, an event class relevant to both\ndark matter direct detection and measurement of coherent neutrino-nucleus\nscattering. The cryostat design, including a thermal and electrical-field\nmodel, is given. A prototype cryostat has been assembled and data acquired to\nevaluate its vacuum and thermal performance.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional scattering of two identical blocks of mass\n$M$ that exchange energy and momentum via elastic collisions with an\nintermediary ball of mass $m=\\alpha M$. Initially, one block is incident upon\nthe ball with the other block at rest. For $\\alpha<1$, the three objects will\nmake multiple collisions with one another. In our analysis, we construct a\nEuclidean vector $\\textbf{V}_n$ whose components are proportional to the\nvelocities of the objects. Energy-momentum conservation then requires a\ncovariant recurrence relation for $\\textbf{V}_n$ that transforms like a pure\nrotation in three dimensions. The analytic solutions of the terminal velocities\nresult in a remarkable prediction for values of $\\alpha$, in cases where the\ninitial energy and momentum of the incident block are completely transferred to\nthe scattered block. We call these values for $\\alpha$ \"magic mass ratios.\"\n", "  Supernovae are important probes of the properties of stars at high redshifts\nbecause they can be detected at early epochs and their masses can be inferred\nfrom their light curves. Finding the first cosmic explosions in the universe\nwill only be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide-Field\nInfrared Survey Telescope and the next generation of extremely large\ntelescopes. But strong gravitational lensing by massive clusters, like those in\nthe Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH), could reveal such\nevents now by magnifying their flux by factors of 10 or more. We find that\nCLASH will likely discover at least 2 - 3 core-collapse supernovae at 5 < z <\n12 and perhaps as many as ten. Future surveys of cluster lenses similar in\nscope to CLASH by the James Webb Space Telescope might find hundreds of these\nevents out to z ~ 15 - 17. Besides revealing the masses of early stars, these\nancient supernovae will also constrain cosmic star formation rates in the era\nof first galaxy formation.\n", "  Polymerases select nucleotides before incorporating them for chemical\nsynthesis during gene replication or transcription. How the selection proceeds\nstepwise efficiently to achieve sufficiently high fidelity and speed is\nessential for polymerase function. We examined step-by-step selections that\nhave conformational transition rates tuned one at time in the polymerase\nelongation cycle, with a controlled differentiation free energy at each\ncheckpoint. The elongation is sustained at non-equilibrium steady state with\nconstant free energy input and heat dissipation. It is found that error\nreduction capability does not improve for selection checkpoints down the\nreaction path. Hence, it is essential to select early to achieve an efficient\nfidelity control. In particular, for two consecutive selections that reject the\nwrong substrate back and inhibit it forward from a same kinetic state, the same\nerror rates are obtained at the same free energy differentiation. The initial\nscreening is indispensible for maintaining the elongation speed high, as the\nwrong nucleotides can be removed quickly and replaced by the right nucleotides\nat the entry. Overall, the elongation error rate can be repeatedly reduced\nthrough multiple selection checkpoints. The study provides a theoretical\nframework to conduct further detailed researches, and assists engineering and\nredesign of related enzymes.\n", "  A way of constructing continuous matrix product states (cMPS) for coupled\nfields is presented here. The cMPS is a variational \\emph{ansatz} for the\nground state of quantum field theories in one dimension. Our proposed scheme is\nbased in the physical interpretation in which the cMPS class can be produced by\nmeans of a dissipative dynamic of a system interacting with a bath. We study\nthe case of coupled bosonic fields. We test the method with previous DMRG\nresults in coupled Lieb Liniger models. Besides, we discuss a novel application\nfor characterizing the Luttinger liquid theory emerging in the low energy\nregime of these theories. Finally, we propose a circuit QED architecture as a\nquantum simulator for coupled fields.\n", "  Achieving true bulk insulating behavior in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the archetypal\ntopological insulator with a simplistic one-band electronic structure and\nsizable band gap, has been prohibited by a well-known self-doping effect caused\nby selenium vacancies, whose extra electrons shift the chemical potential into\nthe bulk conduction band. We report a new synthesis method for achieving\nstoichiometric Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals that exhibit nonmetallic behavior in\nelectrical transport down to low temperatures. Hall effect measurements\nindicate the presence of both electron- and hole-like carriers, with the latter\nidentified with surface state conduction and the achievement of ambipolar\ntransport in bulk Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals without gating techniques. With carrier\nmobilities surpassing the highest values yet reported for topological surface\nstates in this material, the achievement of ambipolar transport via upward band\nbending is found to provide a key method to advancing the potential of this\nmaterial for future study and applications.\n", "  Traditionally, all superhard carbon phases including diamond are electric\ninsulators and all conductive carbon phases including graphite are mechanically\nsoft. Based on first-principles calculation results, we report a superhard but\nconductive carbon phase C21-sc which can be obtained through increasing the sp3\nbonds in the previously proposed soft and conductive phase C20-sc (Phys. Rev. B\n74, 172101 2006). We also show that further increase of sp3 bonds in C21-sc\nresults in a superhard and insulating phase C22-sc with sp3 bonds only. With\nC20-sc, C21-sc, C22-sc and graphite, the X-ray diffraction peaks from the\nunidentified carbon material synthesized by compressing the mixture of\ntetracyanoethylene and carbon black (Carbon, 41, 1309, 2003) can be understood.\nIn view of its positive stability, superhard and conductive features, and the\nstrong possibility of existence in previous experiments, C21-sc is a promising\nmulti-functional material with potential applications in extreme conditions.\n", "  We prove a local well-posedness theorem for the (n+1)-dimensional Einstein\nequations in Lorentzian signature, with initial data $(\\tilde g, K)$ whose\nasymptotic geometry at infinity is similar to that anti-de Sitter (AdS) space,\nand compatible boundary data $\\hat g$ prescribed at the time-like conformal\nboundary of space-time. More precisely, we consider an n-dimensional\nasymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifold $(M,\\tilde g)$ such that the\nconformally rescaled metric $x^2 \\tilde g$ (with $x$ a boundary defining\nfunction) extends to the closure $\\bar M$ of $M$ as a metric of class $C^{n-1}$\nwhich is also polyhomogeneous of class $C^{p}$ on $\\bar M$. Likewise we assume\nthat the conformally rescaled symmetric (0,2)-tensor $x^{2}K$ extends to the\nclosure as a tensor field of class $C^{n-1}$ which is polyhomogeneous of class\n$C^{p-1}$. We assume that the initial data $(\\tilde g, K)$ satisfy the Einstein\nconstraint equations and also that the boundary datum is of class $C^p$ on\n$\\partial M\\times (-T_0,T_0)$ and satisfies a set of natural compatibility\nconditions with the initial data. We then prove that there exists an integer\n$r_n$, depending only on the dimension n, such that if $p \\geq 2q+r_n$, with\n$q$ a positive integer, then there is $T>0$, depending only on the norms of the\ninitial and boundary data, such that the Einstein equations have a unique (up\nto a diffeomorphism) solution $g$ on $(-T,T)\\times M$ with the above initial\nand boundary data, which is such that $x^2g$ is of class $C^{n-1}$ and\npolyhomogeneous of class $C^q$. Furthermore, if $x^2\\tilde g$ and $x^2K$ are\npolyhomogeneous of class $C^\\infty$ and $\\hat g$ is in $C^\\infty$, then $x^2g$\nis polyhomogeneous of class $C^\\infty$.\n", "  The continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model is useful for alleviating the\ncomputational burden of simulating diffusion in actual media. In principle,\nisotropic CTRW only requires knowledge of the step-size, $P_l$, and\nwaiting-time, $P_t$, distributions of the random walk in the medium and it then\ngenerates presumably equivalent walks in free space, which are much faster.\nHere we test the usefulness of CTRW to modelling diffusion of finite-size\nparticles in porous medium generated by loose granular packs. This is done by\nfirst simulating the diffusion process in a model porous medium of mean\ncoordination number, which corresponds to marginal rigidity (the loosest\npossible structure), computing the resulting distributions $P_l$ and $P_t$ as\nfunctions of the particle size, and then using these as input for a free space\nCTRW. The CTRW walks are then compared to the ones simulated in the actual\nmedia.\n  In particular, we study the normal-to-anomalous transition of the diffusion\nas a function of increasing particle size. We find that, given the same $P_l$\nand $P_t$ for the simulation and the CTRW, the latter predicts incorrectly the\nsize at which the transition occurs. We show that the discrepancy is related to\nthe dependence of the effective connectivity of the porous media on the\ndiffusing particle size, which is not captured simply by these distributions.\n  We propose a correcting modification to the CTRW model -- adding anisotropy\n-- and show that it yields good agreement with the simulated diffusion process.\nWe also present a method to obtain $P_l$ and $P_t$ directly from the porous\nsample, without having to simulate an actual diffusion process. This extends\nthe use of CTRW, with all its advantages, to modelling diffusion processes of\nfinite-size particles in such confined geometries.\n", "  We study the mode solution to the Cauchy problem of the scalar wave equation\n$\\Box \\varphi = 0$ in Kasner spacetimes. As a first result, we give the\nexplicit mode solution in axisymmetric Kasner spacetimes, of which flat Kasner\nspacetimes are special cases. Furthermore, we give the small and large time\nasymptotics of the modes in general Kasner spacetimes. Generically, the modes\nin non-flat Kasner spacetimes grow logarithmically for small times, while the\nmodes in flat Kasner spacetimes stay bounded for small times. For large times,\nhowever, the modes in general Kasner spacetimes oscillate with a polynomially\ndecreasing amplitude. This gives a notion of large time frequency of the modes,\nwhich we use to model the wavelength of light rays in Kasner spacetimes. We\nshow that the redshift one obtains in this way actually coincides with the\nusual cosmological redshift.\n", "  The interplay between spin and charge in solids is currently among the most\ndiscussed topics in condensed matter physics. Such interplay gives rise to\nmagneto-electric coupling, which in the case of solids was named\nmagneto-electric effect, as predicted by Curie on the basis of symmetry\nconsiderations. This effect enables the manipulation of magnetization using\nelectrical field or, conversely, the manipulation of electrical polarization by\nmagnetic field. The latter is known as the magnetocapacitance effect. Here, we\nshow that non-equilibrium spin accumulation can induce tunnel\nmagnetocapacitance through the formation of a tiny charge dipole. This dipole\ncan effectively give rise to an additional serial capacitance, which represents\nan extra charging energy that the tunneling electrons would encounter. In the\nsequential tunneling regime, this extra energy can be understood as the energy\nrequired for a single spin to flip. A ferromagnetic single-electron-transistor\nwith tunable magnetic configuration is utilized to demonstrate the proposed\nmechanism. It is found that the extra threshold energy is experienced only by\nelectrons entering the islands, bringing about asymmetry in the measured\nCoulomb diamond. This asymmetry is an unambiguous evidence of spin accumulation\ninduced tunnel magnetocapacitance, and the measured magnetocapacitance value is\nas high as 40%.\n", "  In our present work, five previously proposed sp$^3$ carbon crystals were\nsuggested as silicon allotropes and their stabilities, electronic and optical\nproperties were investigated by first-principles method. We find that these\nallotropes with direct or quasi-direct band gaps in range of 1.2-1.6 eV are\nvery suitable for applications in thin-film solar cells. They display strong\nadsorption coefficients in the visible range of the sunlight in comparison with\ndiamond silicon. These five silicon allotropes are confirmed possessing\npositive dynamical stability and remarkable themodynamical stability close to\nthat of diamond silicon. Especially, the direct band gap M585-silicon\npossessing energy higher than diamond silicon only 25 meV per atom is expected\nto be experimentally produced for thin-film solar cells.\n", "  Motivated by providing preliminary steps to understand the conception of\nquantum gravity, in this paper, we study the phase structure of a semiclassical\ngravitational system. We investigate the stability conditions and phase\ntransition of charged black holes in massive gravity via canonical and\ngeometrical thermodynamic approaches. We point out the effects of massive\nparameter on stability conditions of these black holes and show how massive\ncoefficients affect the phase transition points of these black holes. We also\nstudy the effects of boundary topology on thermodynamical behavior of the\nsystem. In addition, we give some arguments regarding the role of higher\ndimensions and highlight the effect of the electric charge in thermodynamical\nbehavior. Then, we extend our study to geometrical thermodynamic approach and\nshow that it can be a successful method for studying the black hole phase\ntransition. At last, by employing the relation between thermodynamical pressure\nand cosmological constant, critical behavior of the system and the effects of\ndifferent parameters on critical values are investigated.\n", "  The quantum compass model consists of a two-dimensional square spin lattice\nwhere the orientation of the spin-spin interactions depends on the spatial\ndirection of the bonds. It has remarkable symmetry properties and the ground\nstate shows topological degeneracy. The implementation of the quantum compass\nmodel in quantum simulation setups like ultracold atoms and trapped ions is far\nfrom trivial, since spin interactions in those sytems typically are independent\nof the spatial direction. Ising spin interactions, on the contrary, can be\ninduced and controlled in atomic setups with state-of-the art experimental\ntechniques. In this work, we show how the quantum compass model on a\nrectangular lattice can be simulated by the use of the photon-assisted\ntunneling induced by periodic drivings on a quantum Ising spin model. We\ndescribe a procedure to adiabatically prepare one of the doubly-degenerate\nground states of this model by adiabatically ramping down a transverse magnetic\nfield, with surprising differences depending on the parity of the lattice size.\nExact diagonalizations confirm the validity of this approach for small\nlattices. Specific implementations of this scheme are presented with ultracold\natoms in optical lattices in the Mott insulator regime, as well as with Rydberg\natoms.\n", "  In this note we study a class of one-dimensional Ising chain having a highly\ndegenerated set of ground-state configurations. The model consists of spin\nchain having infinite-range pair interactions with a given structure. We show\nthat the set of ground-state configurations of such a model can be fully\ncharacterized by means of symbolic dynamics. Particularly we found that the set\nground- state configurations defines what in symbolic dynamics is called sofic\nshift space. Finally we prove that this system has a non-vanishing residual\nentropy (the topological entropy of the shift space), which can be exactly\ncalculated.\n", "  Motivated by gauge/gravity group in the low energy effective theory of the\nheterotic string theory and novel aspects of massive gravity in the context of\nlattice physics, the minimal coupling of Gauss-Bonnet-massive gravity with\nBorn-Infeld electrodynamics is considered. At first, the metric function is\ncalculated and then the geometrical properties of the solutions are\ninvestigated. It is found that there is an essential singularity at the origin\nand the intrinsic curvature is regular elsewhere. In addition, the effects of\nmassive parameters are studied and black hole solutions with multi horizons are\nfound in this gravity. Also the conserved and thermodynamic quantities are\ncalculated, and it is shown that the solutions satisfy the first law of\nthermodynamics. Furthermore, using heat capacity of these black holes, thermal\nstability and phase transitions are investigated. The variation of different\nparameters and related modifications on the (number of) phase transition are\nexamined. Next, the critical behavior of the Gauss-Bonnet-Born-Infeld-massive\nblack holes in the context of extended phase space is studied. It is shown that\nhow the variation of the different parameters affects the existence and absence\nof phase transition. Also, it is found that for specific values of different\nparameters, these black holes may enjoy the existence of new type of phase\ntransition which to our knowledge was not observed in black hole physics\nbefore.\n", "  We report on the generation of nanosecond mid-infrared pulses having\nfrequency tunability, a narrow linewidth, and a high pulse energy. These pulses\nare obtained by frequency mixing between injection-seeded near-infrared pulses\nin potassium titanyl arsenate crystals. A continuous-wave external cavity laser\ndiode or a Ti:sapphire ring laser is used as a tunable seeding source for the\nnear-infrared pulses. The typical energy of the generated mid-infrared pulses\nis in the range of 0.4-1 mJ/pulse. The tuning wavelength ranges from 3142 to\n4806 nm. A narrow linewidth of 1.4 GHz and good frequency reproducibility of\nthe mid-infrared pulses are confirmed by observing a rovibrational absorption\nline of gaseous carbon monoxide at 4587 nm.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of entanglement entropy in (1+1)-dimensional\nWarped Conformal Field Theories (WCFTs). We implement the Rindler method to\nevaluate entanglement and Renyi entropies for a single interval and along the\nway we interpret our results in terms of twist field correlation functions.\nHolographically a WCFT can be described in terms of Lower Spin Gravity, a\nSL(2,R)xU(1) Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions. We show how to obtain the\nuniversal field theory results for entanglement in a WCFT via holography. For\nthe geometrical description of the theory we introduce the concept of geodesic\nand massive point particles in the warped geometry associated to Lower Spin\nGravity. In the Chern-Simons description we evaluate the appropriate Wilson\nline that captures the dynamics of a massive particle.\n", "  Polymerases are protein enzymes that move along nucleic acid chains and\ncatalyze template-based polymerization reactions during gene transcription and\nreplication. The polymerases also substantially improve transcription or\nreplication fidelity through the non-equilibrium enzymatic cycles. We briefly\nreview computational efforts that have been made toward understanding\nmechano-chemical coupling and fidelity control mechanisms of the polymerase\nelongation. The polymerases are regarded as molecular information motors during\nthe elongation process. It requires a full spectrum of computational approaches\nfrom multiple time and length scales to understand the full polymerase\nfunctional cycle. We keep away from quantum mechanics based approaches to the\npolymerase catalysis due to abundant former surveys, while address only\nstatistical physics modeling approach and all-atom molecular dynamics\nsimulation approach. We organize this review around our own modeling and\nsimulation practices on a single-subunit T7 RNA polymerase, and summarize\ncommensurate studies on structurally similar DNA polymerases. For multi-subunit\nRNA polymerases that have been intensively studied in recent years, we leave\ndetailed discussions on the simulation achievements to other computational\nchemical surveys, while only introduce very recently published representative\nstudies, including our own preliminary work on structure-based modeling on\nyeast RNA polymerase II. In the end, we quickly go through kinetic modeling on\nelongation pauses and backtracking activities. We emphasize the fluctuation and\ncontrol mechanisms of the polymerase actions, highlight the non-equilibrium\nphysical nature of the system, and try to bring some perspectives toward\nunderstanding replication and transcription regulation from single molecular\ndetails to a genome-wide scale.\n", "  Measurements are reported of the cross-correlation of spectra of differential\nposition signals from the Fermilab Holometer, a pair of co-located 39 m long,\nhigh power Michelson interferometers with flat, broadband frequency response in\nthe MHz range. The instrument obtains sensitivity to high frequency correlated\nsignals far exceeding any previous measurement in a broad frequency band\nextending beyond the 3.8 MHz inverse light crossing time of the apparatus. The\ndominant but uncorrelated shot noise is averaged down over $2\\times 10^8$\nindependent spectral measurements with 381 Hz frequency resolution to obtain\n$2.1\\times 10^{-20} \\ \\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity to stationary\nsignals. For signal bandwidths $\\Delta f > 11$ kHz, the sensitivity to strain\n$h$ or shear power spectral density of classical or exotic origin surpasses a\nmilestone $PSD_{\\delta h} < t_p$ where $t_p= 5.39\\times 10^{-44}/\\mathrm{Hz}$\nis the Planck time.\n", "  Assay methods for measuring 238U, 232Th, and 210Pb concentrations in refined\nlead are presented. The 238U and 232Th concentrations are determined using\nisotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) after\nanion exchange column separation of dissolved lead samples. The 210Pb\nconcentration is inferred through {\\alpha}-spectroscopy of a daughter isotope,\n210Po, after chemical precipitation separation on dissolved lead samples.\nSubsequent to the 210Po {\\alpha}-spectroscopy assay, a method for evaluating\n210Pb concentrations in solid lead samples was developed via measurement of\nbremsstrahlung radiation from \\b{eta}-decay of a daughter isotope, 210Bi, by\nemploying a 14-crystal array of high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. Ten\nsources of refined lead were assayed. The 238U concentrations were <34\nmicroBq/kg and the 232Th concentrations ranged <0.6-15 microBq/kg, as\ndetermined by the ICP-MS assay method. The 210Pb concentrations ranged from\n~0.1-75 Bq/kg, as inferred by the 210Po {\\alpha}-spectroscopy assay method.\n", "  We give a concise account on the derivation of hybrid quantum-classical\nmodels for stationary electron transport in graphene, in presence of sharp\npotential steps of barriers. A quantum region (an asymptotically thin strip\naround the potential step or barrier) is coupled through the quantum scattering\ndata to a classical region, where electron transport is described in terms of\nsemiclassical kinetic equations. The diffusive limit of the kinetic model is\nderived by means of the Chapman-Enskog method, which requires the introduction\nof a boundary layer corrector and the discussion of a system of coupled Milne\nproblems.\n", "  We study the space-times admitting a null conformal Killing-Yano tensor whose\ndivergence defines a Killing vector. We analyze the similitudes and differences\nwith the recently studied non null case (Gen. Relativ. Grav. (2015) {\\bf 47}\n1911). The results by Barnes concerning the Birkhoff theorem for the case of\nnull orbits are analyzed and generalized.\n", "  We consider a compact abelian Higgs model in 3+1 dimensions with a\ntopological axion term and construct its dual theories for both bulk and\nboundary at strong coupling. The model may be viewed as describing a\nsuperconductor with magnetic monopoles, which can also be interpreted as a\nfield theory of a topological Mott insulator. We show that this model is dual\nto a non-compact topological field theory of particles and vortices. It has\nexactly the same form of a model for superconducting cosmic strings with an\naxion term. We consider the duality of the boundary field theory at strong\ncoupling and show that in this case $\\theta$ is quantized as $-8\\pi n/m$ where\n$n$ and $m$ are the quantum numbers associated to electric and magnetic\ncharges. These topological states lack a non-interacting equivalent.\n", "  Electron spins in gate-defined quantum dots provide a promising platform for\nquantum computation. In particular, spin-based quantum computing in gallium\narsenide takes advantage of the high quality of semiconducting materials,\nreliability in fabricating arrays of quantum dots, and accurate qubit\noperations. However, the effective magnetic noise arising from the hyperfine\ninteraction with uncontrolled nuclear spins in the host lattice constitutes a\nmajor source of decoherence. Low frequency nuclear noise, responsible for fast\n(10 ns) inhomogeneous dephasing, can be removed by echo techniques. High\nfrequency nuclear noise, recently studied via echo revivals, occurs in narrow\nfrequency bands related to differences in Larmor precession of the three\nisotopes $\\mathbf{^{69}Ga}$, $\\mathbf{^{71}Ga}$, and $\\mathbf{^{75}As}$. Here\nwe show that both low and high frequency nuclear noise can be filtered by\nappropriate dynamical decoupling sequences, resulting in a substantial\nenhancement of spin qubit coherence times. Using nuclear notch filtering, we\ndemonstrate a spin coherence time ($\\mathbf{T_{2}}$) of 0.87 ms, five orders of\nmagnitude longer than typical exchange gate times, and exceeding the longest\ncoherence times reported to date in Si/SiGe gate-defined quantum dots.\n", "  To investigate the barrier effect of grain boundaries on the propagation of\navalanche-like plasticity at the atomic-scale, we perform three-dimensional\nmolecular dynamics simulations by using simplified polycrystal models including\nsymmetric-tilt grain boundaries. The cut-offs of stress-drop distributions\nfollowing power-law distributions decrease as the size of the crystal grains\ndecreases. We show that some deformation avalanches are confined by grain\nboundaries; on the other hand, unignorable avalanches penetrate all the grain\nboundaries included in the models. The blocking probability that one grain\nboundary hinders this system-spanning avalanche is evaluated by using an\nelemental probabilistic model.\n", "  In this paper we present an influence of discontinuous coupling on the\ndynamics of multistable systems. Our model consists of two periodically forced\noscillators that can interact via soft impacts. The controlling parameters are\nthe distance between the oscillators and the difference in the phase of the\nharmonic excitation. When the distance is large two systems do not collide and\na number of different possible solutions can be observed in both of them. When\ndecreasing of the distance, one can observe some transient impacts and then the\nsystems settle down on non-impacting attractor. It is shown that with the\nproperly chosen distance and difference in the phase of the harmonic\nexcitation, the number of possible solutions of the coupled systems can be\nreduced. The proposed method is robust and applicable in many different\nsystems.\n", "  Recent progress on the development of very low noise high purity germanium\nionization spectrometers has produced an instrument of 1.2 kg mass and\nexcellent noise performance. The detector was installed in a low-background\ncryostat intended for use in a direct detection search for low mass, WIMP dark\nmatter. This Transaction reports the thermal characterization of the cryostat,\nspecifications of the newly prepared 1.2 kg p-type point contact germanium\ndetector, and the spectroscopic performance of the integrated system. The\nintegrated detector and low background cryostat achieved\nfull-width-at-half-maximum noise performance of 98 eV for an electronic pulse\ngenerator peak and 1.9 keV for the 1332 keV Co-60 gamma ray.\n", "  Considering the interactions of two arbitrary particles, we obtain an\ninternal energy expression of the complex system having long-range\ninteractions. Based on the postulate of \"equal-probability principle\" for all\nmicrostates, the probability distribution function of the system is derived,\nand consequently, some main statistical physical properties of the system are\nrevealed. It is important to find that the properties of a long-range\ninteraction system are very closely dependent on the interaction coefficient\nand particle number.\n", "  Using quantum chemistry calculations we shed fresh light on the electronic\nstructure and magnetic properties of RuCl3, a proposed realization of the\nhoneycomb Kitaev spin model. It is found that the nearest-neighbor Kitaev\nexchange K is weaker than in 5d5 Ir oxides but still larger than other\neffective spin couplings. The electronic-structure computations also indicate a\nferromagnetic K in the halide, which is supported by a detailed analysis of the\nfield-dependent magnetization. From exact-diagonalization calculations for\nextended Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonians we additionally find that a transition\nfrom zigzag order to a spin-liquid ground state can be induced in RuCl3 with\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  The Casimir effect arises when long-ranged fluctuations are geometrically\nconfined between two surfaces, leading to a macroscopic force. Traditionally,\nthese forces have been observed in quantum systems and near critical points in\nclassical systems. Here we show the existence of Casimir-like forces between\ntwo pinned particles immersed in two-dimensional systems near the jamming\ntransition. We observe two components to the total force: a short-ranged,\ndepletion force and a long-ranged, repulsive Casimir-like force. The\nCasimir-like force dominates as the jamming transition is approached, and when\nthe pinned particles are much larger than the ambient jammed particles. We show\nthat this repulsive force arises due to a clustering of particles with strong\ncontact forces around the perimeter of the pinned particles. As the separation\nbetween the pinned particles decreases, a region of high-pressure develops\nbetween them, leading to a net repulsive force.\n", "  The concept of temperature in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is an outstanding\ntheoretical issue. We propose an energy repartition principle that leads to a\nspectral (mode-dependent) temperature in steady-state nonequilibrium systems.\nThe general concepts are illustrated by analytic solutions of the classical\nHeisenberg spin chain connected to Langevin heat reservoirs with arbitrary\ntemperature profiles. Gradients of external magnetic fields are shown to\nlocalize spin waves in a Wannier-Zeemann fashion, while magnon interactions\nrenormalize the spectral temperature. Our generic results are applicable to\nother thermodynamic systems such as Newtonian liquids, elastic solids, and\nJosephson junctions.\n", "  We address the quantum estimation of the diamagnetic, or $A^2$, term in an\neffective model of light-matter interaction featuring two coupled oscillators.\nFirst, we calculate the quantum Fisher information of the diamagnetic parameter\nin the interacting ground state. Then, we find that typical measurements on the\ntransverse radiation field, such as homodyne detection or photon counting,\npermit to estimate the diamagnetic coupling constant with near-optimal\nefficiency in a wide range of model parameters. Should the model admit a\ncritical point, we also find that both measurements would become asymptotically\noptimal in its vicinity. Finally, we discuss binary discrimination strategies\nbetween the two most debated hypotheses involving the diamagnetic term in\ncircuit QED. While we adopt a terminology appropriate to the Coulomb gauge, our\nresults are also relevant for the electric dipole gauge. In that case, our\ncalculations would describe the estimation of the so-called transverse $P^2$\nterm. The derived metrological benchmarks are general and relevant to any\nimplementation of the model, cavity and circuit QED being two relevant\nexamples.\n", "  Optical force and torque provide unprecedented control on the spatial motion\nof small particles. A valid scientific question, that has many practical\nimplications, concerns the existence of fundamental upper bounds for the\nachievable force and torque exerted by a plane wave illumination with a given\nintensity. Here, while studying isotropic particles, we show that different\nlight-matter interaction channels contribute to the exerted force and torque;\nand analytically derive upper bounds for each of the contributions. Specific\nexamples for particles that achieve those upper bounds are provided. We study\nhow and to which extent different contributions can add up to result in the\nmaximum optical force and torque. Our insights are important for applications\nranging from molecular sorting, particle manipulation, nanorobotics up to\nambitious projects such as laser-propelled spaceships.\n", "  We describe a general approach to proving the impossibility of implementing a\nquantum channel by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), even\nwith an infinite number of rounds, and find that this can often be demonstrated\nby solving a set of linear equations. The method also allows one to design an\nLOCC protocol to implement the channel whenever such a protocol exists in any\nfinite number of rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, the computational expense for\nanalyzing LOCC channels is not much greater than that for LOCC measurements. We\napply the method to several examples, two of which provide numerical evidence\nthat the set of quantum channels that are not LOCC is not closed and that there\nexist channels that can be implemented by LOCC either in one round or in three\nrounds that are on the boundary of the set of all LOCC channels.\n  Although every LOCC protocol must implement a separable quantum channel, it\nis a very difficult task to determine whether or not a given channel is\nseparable. Fortunately, prior knowledge that the channel is separable is not\nrequired for application of our method.\n", "  This paper addresses the problem of identifying different flow environments\nfrom sparse data collected by wing strain sensors. Insects regularly perform\nthis feat using a sparse ensemble of noisy strain sensors on their wing. First,\nwe obtain strain data from numerical simulation of a Manduca sexta hawkmoth\nwing undergoing different flow environments. Our data-driven method learns\nlow-dimensional strain features originating from different aerodynamic\nenvironments using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes in the frequency\ndomain, and leverages sparse approximation to classify a set of strain\nfrequency signatures using a dictionary of POD modes. This bio-inspired machine\nlearning architecture for dictionary learning and sparse classification permits\nfewer costly physical strain sensors while being simultaneously robust to\nsensor noise. A measurement selection algorithm identifies frequencies that\nbest discriminate the different aerodynamic environments in low-rank POD\nfeature space. In this manner, sparse and noisy wing strain data can be\nexploited to robustly identify different aerodynamic environments encountered\nin flight, providing insight into the stereotyped placement of neurons that act\nas strain sensors on a Manduca sexta hawkmoth wing.\n", "  We derive the first systematic observational constraints on reheating in\nmodels of inflation where an additional light scalar field contributes to\nprimordial density perturbations and affects the expansion history during\nreheating. This encompasses the original curvaton model but also covers a\nlarger class of scenarios. We find that, compared to the single-field case,\nlower values of the energy density at the end of inflation and of the reheating\ntemperature are preferred when an additional scalar field is introduced. For\ninstance, if inflation is driven by a quartic potential, which is one of the\nmost favoured models when a light scalar field is added, the upper bound\n$T_{\\mathrm{reh}}<5\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ on the reheating temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{reh}}$ is derived, and the implications of this value on\npost-inflationary physics are discussed. The information gained about reheating\nis also quantified and it is found that it remains modest in plateau inflation\n(though still larger than in the single-field version of the model) but can\nbecome substantial in quartic inflation. The role played by the vev of the\nadditional scalar field at the end of inflation is highlighted, and opens\ninteresting possibilities for exploring stochastic inflation effects that could\ndetermine its distribution.\n", "  Disruption-generated runaway electrons (RE) present an outstanding issue for\nITER. The predictive computational studies of RE generation rely on\norbit-averaged computations and, as such, they lack the effects from the\nmagnetic field stochasticity. Since stochasiticity is naturally present in\npost-disruption plasma, and externally induced stochastization offers a\nprominent mechanism to mitigate RE avalanche, we present an advection-diffusion\nmodel that can be used to couple an orbit-following code to an orbit-averaged\ntool in order to capture the cross-field transport and to overcome the latter's\nlimitation. The transport coefficients are evaluated via a Monte Carlo method.\nWe show that the diffusion coefficient differs significantly from the\nwell-known Rechester-Rosenbluth result. We also demonstrate the importance of\nincluding the advection: it has a two-fold role both in modelling transport\nbarriers created by magnetic islands and in amplifying losses in regions where\nthe islands are not present.\n", "  The quantum Rabi model describes the interaction between a two-level quantum\nsystem and a single bosonic mode. We propose a method to perform a quantum\nsimulation of the quantum Rabi model introducing a novel implementation of the\ntwo-level system, provided by the occupation of Bloch bands in the first\nBrillouin zone by ultracold atoms in tailored optical lattices. The effective\nqubit interacts with a quantum harmonic oscillator implemented in an optical\ndipole trap. Our realistic proposal allows to experimentally investigate the\nquantum Rabi model for extreme parameter regimes, which are not achievable with\nnatural light-matter interactions. Furthermore, we also identify a generalized\nversion of the quantum Rabi model in a periodic phase space.\n", "  In this article we consider products of real random matrices with fixed size.\nLet $A_1,A_2, \\dots $ be i.i.d $k \\times k$ real matrices, whose entries are\nindependent and identically distributed from probability measure $\\mu$. Let\n$X_n = A_1A_2\\dots A_n$. Then it is conjectured that $$\\mathbb{P}(X_n \\text{\nhas all real eigenvalues}) \\rightarrow 1 \\text{ as } n \\rightarrow \\infty.$$ We\nshow that the conjecture is true when $\\mu$ has an atom.\n", "  We use the functional renormalization group (FRG) to derive analytical\nexpressions for thermodynamic observables (density, pressure, entropy, and\ncompressibility) as well as for single-particle properties (wavefunction\nrenormalization and effective mass) of interacting bosons in two dimensions as\na function of temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$. We focus on the\nquantum disordered and the quantum critical regime close to the dilute Bose gas\nquantum critical point. Our approach is based on a truncated vertex expansion\nof the hierarchy of FRG flow equations and the decoupling of the two-body\ncontact interaction in the particle-particle channel using a suitable\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Our analytic FRG results extend previous\nanalytical renormalization group calculations for thermodynamic observables at\n$\\mu =0$ to finite values of $\\mu$. To confirm the validity of our FRG\napproach, we have also performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the\nmagnetization, the susceptibility, and the correlation length of the\ntwo-dimensional spin-$1/2$ quantum $XY$ model with coupling $J$ in a regime\nwhere its quantum critical behavior is controlled by the dilute Bose gas\nquantum critical point. We find that our analytical results describe the Monte\nCarlo data for $\\mu \\leq 0$ rather accurately up to relatively high\ntemperatures $T \\lesssim 0.1 J$.\n", "  This article focuses on the general theory of open quantum systems in the\nGaussian regime and explores a number of diverse ramifications and consequences\nof the theory. We shall first introduce the Gaussian framework in its full\ngenerality, including a classification of Gaussian (also known as\n\"general-dyne\") quantum measurements. In doing so, we will give a compact proof\nfor the parametrisation of the most general Gaussian completely positive map,\nwhich we believe to be missing in the existing literature. We will then move on\nto consider the linear coupling with a white noise bath, and derive the\ndiffusion equations that describe the evolution of Gaussian states under such\ncircumstances. Starting from these equations, we outline a constructive method\nto derive general master equations that apply outside the Gaussian regime.\nNext, we include the general-dyne monitoring of the environmental degrees of\nfreedom and recover the Riccati equation for the conditional evolution of\nGaussian states. Our derivation relies exclusively on the standard quantum\nmechanical update of the system state, through the evaluation of Gaussian\noverlaps. The parametrisation of the conditional dynamics we obtain is novel\nand, at variance with existing alternatives, directly ties in to physical\ndetection schemes. We conclude our study with two examples of conditional\ndynamics that can be dealt with conveniently through our formalism,\ndemonstrating how monitoring can suppress the noise in optical parametric\nprocesses as well as stabilise systems subject to diffusive scattering.\n", "  The issue of Hermiticity of the Higgs boson interaction with fermions is\naddressed. A model for non-Hermitian Yukawa interaction is proposed and\napproximation of one fermion generation is considered. Symmetry properties of\nthe corresponding $h f \\bar{f}$ Lagrangian with respect to the discrete P, C\nand T transformations are analyzed, and the modified Dirac equation for the\nfree fermion is studied. Longitudinal polarization of the fermions in the decay\n$h \\to f \\bar{f}$, which arises due to non-Hermiticity of the $h f \\bar{f}$\ninteraction, is discussed. It is suggested to study effects of this\nnon-Hermiticity in the decay $h \\to \\tau^- \\tau^+ \\to \\mu^- {\\bar \\nu}_\\mu\n\\nu_\\tau \\, \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu {\\bar \\nu}_\\tau$, for which observables (asymmetries)\nare constructed which take nonzero values for a non-Hermitian $h \\tau^- \\tau^+$\ninteraction. These asymmetries are analyzed for various configurations of the\nmuon energies.\n", "  On the one hand, electromagnetic dual particles preserve the helicity of\nlight upon interaction. On the other hand, chiral particles respond differently\nto light of opposite helicity. These two properties on their own constitute a\nsource of fascination. Their combined action, however, is less explored. Here,\nwe study on analytical grounds the force and torque as well as the optical\ncross sections of dual chiral particles in the dipolar approximation exerted by\na particular wave of well-defined helicity: A circularly polarized plane wave.\nWe put emphasis on particles that possess a maximally electromagnetic chiral\nand hence dual response. Besides the analytical insights, we also investigate\nthe exerted optical force and torque on a real particle at the example of a\nmetallic helix that is designed to approach the maximal electromagnetic\nchirality condition. Various applications in the context of optical sorting but\nalso nanorobotics can be foreseen considering the particles studied in this\ncontribution.\n", "  We investigate the effects of resonance-continuum interference on the\ndiphoton spectrum in the presence of a new spin-0 or spin-2 state produced via\ngluons or quarks and decaying to pairs of photons. Interference effects can\nsignificantly influence the extraction of resonance masses and widths from the\ndiphoton spectrum, particularly in the case of a spin-2 resonance produced via\nquarks. We illustrate these effects via a binned likelihood analysis of LHC\ndiphoton data at both 8 and 13 TeV.\n", "  I construct a model of the inner crust of neutron stars using interactions\nfrom chiral effective field theory (EFT) in order to calculate its equation of\nstate (EOS), shear properties, and the spectrum of crustal shear modes. I\nsystematically study uncertainties associated with the nuclear physics input,\nthe crust composition, and neutron entrainment, and estimate their impact on\ncrustal shear properties and the shear-mode spectrum. I find that the\nuncertainties originate mainly in two sources: The neutron-matter EOS and\nneutron entrainment. I compare the spectrum of crustal shear modes to observed\nfrequencies of quasi-periodic oscillations in the afterglow of giant\n$\\gamma$-ray bursts and find that all of these frequencies could be described\nwithin uncertainties, which are, however, at present too sizable to infer\nneutron-star properties from observations.\n", "  We present Global MOdel for the radio Sky Spectrum (GMOSS) -- a novel,\nphysically motivated model of the low-frequency radio sky from 22 MHz to 23\nGHz. GMOSS invokes different physical components and associated radiative\nprocesses to describe the sky spectrum over 3072 pixels of $5^{\\circ}$\nresolution. The spectra are allowed to be convex, concave or of more complex\nform with contributions from synchrotron emission, thermal emission and\nfree-free absorption included. Physical parameters that describe the model are\noptimized to best fit four all-sky maps at 150 MHz, 408 MHz, 1420 MHz and 23\nGHz and two maps at 22 MHz and 45 MHz generated using the Global Sky Model of\nde Oliveira-Costa et al. (2008). The fractional deviation of model to data has\na median value of $6\\%$ and is less than $17\\%$ for $99\\%$ of the pixels.\nThough aimed at modeling of foregrounds for the global signal arising from the\nredshifted 21-cm line of Hydrogen during Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization\n(EoR) - over redshifts $150\\lesssim z \\lesssim 6$, GMOSS is well suited for any\napplication that requires simulating spectra of the low-frequency radio sky as\nwould be observed by the beam of any instrument. The complexity in spectral\nstructure that naturally arises from the underlying physics of the model\nprovides a useful expectation for departures from smoothness in EoR foreground\nspectra and hence may guide the development of algorithms for EoR signal\ndetection. This aspect is further explored in a subsequent paper.\n", "  We enumerate the cases in 2d conformal field theory where the logarithm of\nthe reduced density matrix (the entanglement or modular hamiltonian) may be\nwritten as an integral over the energy-momentum tensor times a local weight.\nThese include known examples and new ones corresponding to the time-dependent\nscenarios of a global and local quench. In these latter cases the entanglement\nhamiltonian depends on the momentum density as well as the energy density. In\nall cases the entanglement spectrum is that of the appropriate boundary CFT. We\nemphasize the role of boundary conditions at the entangling surface and the\nappearance of boundary entropies as universal O(1) terms in the entanglement\nentropy.\n", "  The negative power absorption in low pressure plasmas is investigated by\nmeans of an analyical model which couples Boltzmann's equation and the\nquasi-stationary Maxwell's equation. Exploiting standard Hilbert space methods\nan explicit solution for both, the electric field and the distribution function\nof the electrons for a bounded discharge configuration subject to an\nunsymmetrical excitation has been found for the first time. The model is\napplied to a low pressure inductively coupled plasma discharge. In this context\nparticularly the anomalous skin effect and the effect of phase mixing is\ndiscussed. The analytical solution is compared with results from\nelectromagnetic full wave particle in cell simulations. Excellent agreement\nbetween the analytical and the numerical results is found.\n", "  Starting with the two-band description of an orbital Feshbach resonance, we\nstudy superfluid properties of a trapped $^{173}$Yb Fermi gas under the\nassumptions of a local-density approximation for the trapping potential and a\nmean-field approximation for the intra-band Cooper pairings. In particular, we\ninvestigate the competition and interplay between the pair-breaking effect that\nis caused by the inter-band detuning energy, and the pair-breaking and\nthermal-broadening effects that are simultaneously caused by the temperature.\nWe predict several experimental signatures that are directly caused by this\ninterplay including a spatial separation of superfluid and normal phases within\nthe trap, and could play decisive roles in probing two-band superfluidity in\nthese systems.\n", "  Observational missions have provided us with a reliable model of the\nevolution of the universe starting from the last scattering surface all the way\nto future infinity. Furthermore given a specific model of inflation, using\nquantum field theory on curved space-times this history can be pushed\n\\emph{back in time} to the epoch when space-time curvature was some $10^{62}$\ntimes that at the horizon of a solar mass black hole! However, to extend the\nhistory further back to the Planck regime requires input from quantum gravity.\nAn important aspect of this input is the choice of the background quantum\ngeometry and of the Heisenberg state of cosmological perturbations thereon,\nmotivated by Planck scale physics. This paper introduces first steps in that\ndirection. Specifically we propose two principles that link quantum geometry\nand Heisenberg uncertainties in the Planck epoch with late time physics and\nexplore in detail the observational consequences of the initial conditions they\nselect. We find that the predicted temperature-temperature (T-T) correlations\nfor scalar modes are indistinguishable from standard inflation at small angular\nscales even though the initial conditions are now set in the deep Planck\nregime. However, \\emph{there is a specific power suppression at large angular\nscales}. As a result, the predicted spectrum provides a better fit to the\nPLANCK mission data than standard inflation, where the initial conditions are\nset in the general relativity regime. Thus, our proposal brings out a deep\ninterplay between the ultraviolet and the infrared. Finally, the proposal also\nleads to specific predictions for power suppression at large angular scales\nalso for the (T-E and E-E) correlations involving electric polarization. The\nPLANCK team is expected to release this data in the coming year.\n", "  We present analytical and numerical results regarding the magnetization full\ncounting statistics (FCS) of a subsystem in the ground-state of the\nHaldane-Shastry chain. Exact Pfaffian expressions are derived for the cumulant\ngenerating function, as well as any observable diagonal in the spin basis. In\nthe limit of large systems, the scaling of the FCS is found to be in agreement\nwith the Luttinger liquid theory. The same techniques are also applied to\ninhomogeneous deformations of the chain. This introduces a certain amount of\ndisorder in the system; however we show numerically that this is not sufficient\nto flow to the random singlet phase, that corresponds to $XXZ$ chains with\nuncorrelated bond disorder.\n", "  A multiply-lensed galaxy, MACS0647-JD, with a probable photometric redshift\nof $z\\simeq 10.7^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ is claimed to constitute one of the very\nearliest known galaxies, formed well before reionization was completed.\nHowever, spectral evidence that MACS0647-JD lies at high redshift has proven\ninfeasible and so here we seek an independent lensing based \"geometric\nredshift\" derived from the angles between the three lensed images of\nMACS0647-JD, using our free-form mass model (WSLAP+) for the lensing cluster\nMACSJ0647.7+7015 (at $z=0.591$). Our lens model uses the 9 sets of multiple\nimages, including those of MACS0647-JD, identified by the CLASH survey towards\nthis cluster. We convincingly exclude the low redshift regime of $z<3$, for\nwhich convoluted critical curves are generated by our method, as the solution\nbends to accommodate the wide angles of MACS0647-JD for this low redshift.\nInstead, a best fit to all sets of lensed galaxy positions and redshifts\nprovides a geometric redshift of $z\\simeq 10.8^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ for MACS0647-JD,\nstrongly supporting the higher photometric redshift solution. Importantly, we\nfind a tight linear relation between the relative brightnesses of all 9 sets of\nmultiply lensed images and their relative magnifications as predicted by our\nmodel. This agreement provides a benchmark for the quality of the lens model,\nand establishes the robustness of our free-form lensing method for measuring\nmodel-independent geometric source distances and for deriving objective central\ncluster mass distributions. After correcting for its magnification the\nluminosity of MACS0647-JD remains relatively high at $M_{UV}=-19.4$, which is\nwithin a factor of a few in flux of some surprisingly luminous $z\\simeq\n10$--$11$ candidates discovered recently in Hubble black field surveys.\n", "  Three dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals which can be seen as 3D analogues of\ngraphene have attracted enormous interests in research recently. In order to\napply these ultrahigh-mobility materials in future electronic/optoelectronic\ndevices, it is crucial to understand the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited\ncarriers and their coupling with lattice. In this work, we report ultrafast\ntransient reflection measurements of the photoexcited carrier dynamics in\ncadmium arsenide (Cd3As2), which is one of the most stable Dirac semimetals\nthat have been confirmed experimentally. By using low energy probe photon of\n0.3 eV, we probed the dynamics of the photoexcited carriers that are\nDirac-Fermi-like approaching the Dirac point. We systematically studied the\ntransient reflection on bulk and nanoplate samples that have different doping\nintensities by tuning the probe wavelength, pump power and lattice temperature,\nand find that the dynamical evolution of carrier distributions can be retrieved\nqualitatively by using a two-temperature model. This result is very similar to\nthat of graphene, but the carrier cooling through the optical phonon couplings\nis slower and lasts over larger electron temperature range because the optical\nphonon energies in Cd3As2 are much lower than those in graphene.\n", "  We investigate the role of coarsened measurement reference in quantum\nmetrology. Coarsened measurement reference comes from the coarsened reference\ntime and basis. When the measurement based on one common reference basis, the\ndisadvantage can be removed by symmetry. Due to the coarsened reference basis,\nentangled states can not perform better than product states for large number of\nprobe particles. Given a finite uncertainty of the coarsened reference basis,\nthe optimal number of probe particle is obtained in estimating phase. Finally,\nwe prove that the maximally entangled state always achieves better precision\nunder the case of non-Markovian dephasing than that under the case of Markovian\ndephasing. The product state is more resistant to interference of the coarsened\nreference time than the entangled state.\n", "  In this paper we summarize the effects of magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities\non the spin dynamics in Febased superconductors and their parent compounds. The\neffects of chemical substitution, vacancies, and disorder on the suppression or\nstabilization of superconductivity and spin-density-wave phases are reviewed in\nthe context of recent neutron-spectroscopy measurements of spin excitations. We\nalso present new results on the structure of magnetic fluctuations in BaFe2As2\nsingle crystals doped with Mn local moments and discuss them in relationship to\nthe previously reported (pi, pi) branch of checkerboard magnetic excitations.\n", "  We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a local quench that\nconnects two spin-1/2 XXZ chains prepared in the ground state of the\nHamiltonian in different phases, one in the ferromagnetic phase and the other\nin the critical phase. We analyze the time evolution of the on-site\nmagnetization and bipartite entanglement entropy via adaptive time-dependent\ndensity matrix renormalization group. In systems with short-range inter-\nactions, such as the one we consider, the velocity of information transfer is\nexpected to be bounded, giving rise to a light-cone effect. Interestingly, our\nresults show that, when the anisotropy parameter of the critical chain is\nsufficiently close to that of the isotropic ferromagnet, the light cone is\ndetermined by the velocity of spin-wave bound states that propagate faster than\nsingle-particle (\"spinon\") excitations. Furthermore, we investigate how the\nsystem approaches equilibrium in the inhomogeneous ground state of the\nconnected system, in which the ferromagnetic chain induces a nonzero\nmagnetization in the critical chain in the vicinity of the interface.\n", "  We demonstrate how quantum interference may lead to the appearance of robust\nedge-like states of a single ultracold atom in a two-dimensional optical\nribbon. We show that these states can be engineered either within the manifold\nof local ground states of the sites forming the ribbon, or of states carrying\none unit of angular momentum. In the former case, we show that the\nimplementation of edge-like states can be extended to other geometries, such as\ntilted square lattices. In the latter case, we suggest to use the winding\nnumber associated to the angular momentum as a synthetic dimension.\n", "  Spin nematic phase is a phase of frustrated quantum magnets with a\nquadrupolar order of electron spins. Since the spin nematic order is usually\nmasked in experimentally accessible quantities, it is important to develop a\nmethodology for detecting the spin nematic order experimentally. In this paper\nwe propose a convenient method for detecting quasi-long-range spin nematic\ncorrelations of a quadrupolar Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state of $S=1/2$\nfrustrated ferromagnetic spin chain compounds, using electron spin resonance\n(ESR). We focus on linewidth of a so-called paramagnetic resonance peak in ESR\nabsorption spectrum. We show that a characteristic angular dependence of the\nlinewidth on the direction of magnetic field arises in the spin nematic phase.\nMeasurments of the angular dependence give a signature of the quadrupolar\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid state. In our method we change only the direction of\nthe magnetic field, keeping the magnitude of the magnetic field and the\ntemperature. Therefore, our method is advantageous for investigating the\none-dimensional quadrupolar liquid phase that usually occupies only a narrow\nregion of the phase diagram.\n", "  A very good linear correlation is found between the four-point charge radius\nrelation $\\delta R_{2p-2n}(Z,N)$ with that of quadrupole deformation data in\neven-even nuclei. This results in a further improved charge radius relation\nthat holds in a precision of about 5$\\times 10^{-3}$ fm. Such correlations are\nalso seen in global nuclear models, their precisions, however, are not enough\nto be consistent with the experimental data. The new relation between charge\nradii and deformation of even-even nuclei can be generalized to the reduced\nelectric quadrupole transition probability $B(E2)$ between the first $2^+$\nstate and the $0^+$ ground state, and the mean lifetime $\\tau$ of the first\n2$^+$ state.\n", "  We discuss theoretically rather rear example of spin-flop transition which is\naccompanied with changing the type of magnetic ordering and which seemingly has\nnot been addressed yet. We demonstrate that changing the type of magnetic\nordering can manifest itself in antiferromagnetic (AF) resonance experiments as\nan apparent peculiar switching of the anisotropy at the transition from the\neasy-axis type to the easy-plane one. We argue that this kind of spin-flop\ntransition is observed recently by K.Yu. Povarov et al., Phys. Rev. B 87,\n214402 (2013) in Cu(pz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$ (where pz denotes pyrazine), one of\nthe best realizations of spin-1/2 Heisenberg AFs on square lattice having a\nvery small anisotropy. We show that the magnetic ordering changes at the\nspin-flop transition in this material in the direction perpendicular to AF\nsquare planes. We examine the microscopic mechanism of such behavior in\nCu(pz)$_2$(ClO$_4$)$_2$ and find that dipolar forces and extremely small\nexchange coupling between spins from neighboring planes are responsible for it.\n", "  Semiconductor laser arrays have been investigated experimentally and\ntheoretically from the viewpoint of temporal and spatial coherence for the past\nforty years. In this work, we are focusing on a rather novel complex collective\nbehavior, namely chimera states, where synchronized clusters of emitters\ncoexist with unsynchronized ones. For the first time, we find such states exist\nin large diode arrays based on quantum well gain media with nearest-neighbor\ninteractions. The crucial parameters are the evanescent coupling strength and\nthe relative optical frequency detuning between the emitters of the array. By\nemploying a recently proposed figure of merit for classifying chimera states,\nwe provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the observed dynamics. The\ncorresponding chimeras are identified as turbulent according to the irregular\ntemporal behavior of the classification measure.\n", "  We analyze the effects of an applied magnetic field on the phase diagram of a\nweakly-correlated electron system with imperfect nesting. The Hamiltonian under\nstudy describes two bands: electron and hole ones. Both bands have spherical\nFermi surfaces, whose radii are slightly mismatched due to doping. These types\nof models are often used in the analysis of magnetic states in chromium and its\nalloys, superconducting iron pnictides, AA-type bilayer graphene, borides, etc.\nAt zero magnetic field, the uniform ground state of the system turns out to be\nunstable against electronic phase separation. The applied magnetic field\naffects the phase diagram in several ways. In particular, the Zeeman term\nstabilizes new antiferromagnetic phases. It also significantly shifts the\nboundaries of inhomogeneous (phase-separated) states. At sufficiently high\nfields, the Landau quantization gives rise to oscillations of the order\nparameters and of the N\\'eel temperature as a function of the magnetic field.\n", "  We study the build up of complexity on the example of 1 kg matter in\ndifferent forms. We start on the simplest example of ideal gases, and then\ncontinue with more complex chemical, biological, life and social and technical\nstructures. We assess the complexity of these systems quantitatively, based on\ntheir entropy. We present a method to attribute the same entropy to known\nphysical systems and to complex organic molecules up to a DNA. The important\nsteps in this program and the basic obstacles are discussed.\n", "  In the framework of the color-magnetic interaction, we systematically\ninvestigate the mass splittings of the $QQ\\bar{Q}\\bar{q}$ tetraquark states and\nestimated their rough masses in this work. These systems include the explicitly\nexotic states $cc\\bar{b}\\bar{q}$ and $bb\\bar{c}\\bar{q}$ and the hidden exotic\nstates $cc\\bar{c}\\bar{q}$, $cb\\bar{b}\\bar{q}$, $bc\\bar{c}\\bar{q}$, and\n$bb\\bar{b}\\bar{q}$. If a state around the estimated mass region could be\nobserved, its nature as a genuine tetraquark is favored. The strong decay\npatterns shown here will be helpful to the experimental search for these exotic\nstates.\n", "  Uniaxial compressive strain along the [001] direction strongly suppresses the\nspin relaxation in silicon. When the strain level is large enough so that\nelectrons are redistributed only in the two valleys along the strain axis, the\ndominant scattering mechanisms are quenched and electrons mainly experience\nintra-axis scattering processes (intravalley or intervalley scattering within\nvalleys on the same crystal axis). We first derive the spin-flip matrix\nelements due to intra-axis electron scattering off impurities, and then provide\na comprehensive model of the spin relaxation time due to all possible\ninteractions of conduction-band electrons with impurities and phonons. We\npredict nearly three orders of magnitude improvement in the spin relaxation\ntime of $\\sim10^{19}\\text{cm}^{-3}$ antimony-doped silicon (Si:Sb) at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the effect of finite bias and magnetic field\non the tunneling-induced decay of the state of a quantum dot by applying a\nrecently discovered general duality [PRB 93, 81411 (2016)]. This duality\nprovides deep physical insight into the decay dynamics of electronic open\nquantum systems with strong Coulomb interaction. It associates the amplitudes\nof decay eigenmodes of the actual system to the eigenmodes of a so-called dual\nsystem with attractive interaction. Thereby, it predicts many surprising\nfeatures in the transient transport and its dependence on experimental control\nparameters: the attractive interaction of the dual model shows up as sharp\nfeatures in the amplitudes of measurable time-dependent currents through the\nactual repulsive system. In particular, for interacting quantum dots, the\ntime-dependent heat current exhibits a decay mode that dissipates the\ninteraction energy and that is tied to the fermion parity of the system. We\nshow that its decay amplitude has an unexpected gate-voltage dependence that is\nrobust up to sizable bias voltages and then bifurcates, reflecting that the\nCoulomb blockade is lifted in the dual system. Furthermore, combining our\nduality relation with the known Iche-duality, we derive new symmetry properties\nof the decay rates as a function of magnetic field and gate voltage. Finally,\nwe quantify charge- and spin-mode mixing due to the magnetic field using a\nsingle mixing parameter.\n", "  We perform smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of an isolated\ngalaxy with a new treatment for dust formation and destruction. To this aim, we\ntreat dust and metal production self-consistently with star formation and\nsupernova feedback. For dust, we consider a simplified model of grain size\ndistribution by representing the entire range of grain sizes with large and\nsmall grains. We include dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by\nsupernova (SN) shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain\ndisruption by shattering. We find that the assumption of fixed dust-to-metal\nmass ratio becomes no longer valid when the galaxy is older than 0.2 Gyr, at\nwhich point the grain growth by accretion starts to contribute to the nonlinear\nrise of dust-to-gas ratio. As expected in our previous one-zone model,\nshattering triggers grain growth by accretion since it increases the total\nsurface area of grains. Coagulation becomes significant when the galaxy age is\ngreater than $\\sim$ 1 Gyr: at this epoch the abundance of small grains becomes\nhigh enough to raise the coagulation rate of small grains. We further compare\nthe radial profiles of dust-to-gas ratio $(\\mathcal{D})$ and dust-to-metal\nratio $(\\mathcal{D}/Z)$ (i.e., depletion) at various ages with observational\ndata. We find that our simulations broadly reproduce the radial gradients of\ndust-to-gas ratio and depletion. In the early epoch ($\\lesssim 0.3$ Gyr), the\nradial gradient of $\\mathcal{D}$ follows the metallicity gradient with\n$\\mathcal{D}/Z$ determined by the dust condensation efficiency in stellar\nejecta, while the $\\mathcal{D}$ gradient is steeper than the $Z$ gradient at\nthe later epochs because of grain growth by accretion. The framework developed\nin this paper is applicable to any SPH-based galaxy evolution simulations\nincluding cosmological ones.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the relic abundance of the dark matter particles\nwhen they can annihilate into sterile neutrinos with the mass $\\lesssim 100\n\\text{ GeV}$ in a simple model. Unlike the usual standard calculations, the\nsterile neutrino may fall out of the thermal equilibrium with the thermal bath\nbefore the dark matter freezes out. In such a case, if the Yukawa coupling\n$y_N$ between the Higgs and the sterile neutrino is small, this process gives\nrise to a larger $\\Omega_{\\text{DM}} h^2$ so we need a larger coupling between\nthe dark matter and the sterile neutrino for a correct relic abundance.\n", "  The primary goal in the study of entanglement as a resource theory is to find\nconditions that determine when one quantum state can or cannot be transformed\ninto another via local operations and classical communication. This is\ntypically done through entanglement monotones or conversion witnesses. Such\nquantities cannot be computed for arbitrary quantum states in general, but it\nis useful to consider classes of symmetric states for which closed-form\nexpressions can be found. In this paper, we show how to compute the convex roof\nof any entanglement monotone for all Werner states. The convex roofs of the\nwell-known Vidal monotones are computed for all isotropic states, and we show\nhow this method can generalize to other entanglement measures and other types\nof symmetries as well. We also present necessary and sufficient conditions that\ndetermine when a pure bipartite state can be deterministically converted into a\nWerner state or an isotropic state.\n", "  It is shown that given a Lagrangian for a system with a finite number of\ndegrees of freedom, the existence of a variational symmetry is equivalent to\nthe existence of coordinates in the extended configuration space such that one\nof the coordinates is ignorable.\n", "  We investigate genuine multipartite nonlocality of pure permutationally\ninvariant multimode Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, as detected\nby the violation of Svetlichny inequality. We identify the phase space settings\nleading to the largest violation of the inequality when using displaced parity\nmeasurements, distinguishing our results between the cases of even and odd\ntotal number of modes. We further consider pseudospin measurements and show\nthat, for three-mode states with asymptotically large squeezing degree,\nparticular settings of these measurements allow one to approach the maximum\nviolation of Svetlichny inequality allowed by quantum mechanics. This indicates\nthat the strongest manifestation of genuine multipartite quantum nonlocality is\nin principle verifiable on Gaussian states.\n", "  We provide Monte Carlo estimates of the scaling of the length $L_{n}$ of the\nlongest increasing subsequences of $n$-steps random walks for several different\ndistributions of step lengths, short and heavy-tailed. Our simulations indicate\nthat, barring possible logarithmic corrections, $L_{n} \\sim n^{\\theta}$ with\nthe leading scaling exponent $0.60 \\lesssim \\theta \\lesssim 0.69$ for the\nheavy-tailed distributions of step lengths examined, with values increasing as\nthe distribution becomes more heavy-tailed, and $\\theta \\simeq 0.57$ for\ndistributions of finite variance, irrespective of the particular distribution.\nThe results are consistent with existing rigorous bounds for $\\theta$, although\nin a somewhat surprising manner. For random walks with step lengths of finite\nvariance, we conjecture that the correct asymptotic behavior of $L_{n}$ is\ngiven by $\\sqrt{n}\\ln n$, and also propose the form of the subleading\nasymptotics. The distribution of $L_{n}$ was found to follow a simple scaling\nform with scaling functions that vary with $\\theta$. Accordingly, when the step\nlengths are of finite variance they seem to be universal. The nature of this\nscaling remains unclear, since we lack a working model, microscopic or\nhydrodynamic, for the behavior of the length of the longest increasing\nsubsequences of random walks.\n", "  We consider two modifications of a recently proposed three-terminal quantum\ndot heat engine. First, we investigate the necessity of the thermalization\nassumption, namely that electrons are always thermalized by inelastic processes\nwhen traveling across the cavity where the heat is supplied. Second, we analyze\nvarious arrangements of tunneling-coupled quantum dots in order to implement a\ntransmission function that is superior to the Lorentzian transmission function\nof a single quantum dot. We show that the maximum power of the heat engine can\nbe improved by about a factor of two, even for a small number of dots, by\nchoosing an optimal structure.\n", "  In this work, we compare the performance of plasmonic waveguide integrated\nstub resonators based on 2D metal-dielectric-metal and 3D slot waveguide (SWG)\ngeometries. We show that scattering matrix theory can be extended to 3D\ndevices, and by employing scattering matrix theory, we provide the guidelines\nfor designing plasmonic 2D and 3D single-stub and double-stub resonators with a\ndesired spectral response at the design wavelength. We provide transmission\nmaps of 2D and 3D double-stub resonators versus stub lengths, and we specify\nthe different regions on these maps that result in a minimum, a maximum, or a\nplasmonically induced transparency shape in the transmission spectrum.\nRadiation loss from waveguide terminations leads to a degradation of the 3D\nSWG-based resonators. We illustrate improved waveguide terminations that boost\nresonator properties. We verify our results with 3D finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) simulations.\n", "  Ensemble density functional theory (eDFT) is an exact time-independent\nalternative to time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for the calculation of excitation\nenergies. Despite its formal simplicity and advantages in contrast to TD-DFT\n(multiple excitations, for example, can be easily taken into account in an\nensemble), eDFT is not standard which is essentially due to the lack of\nreliable approximate exchange-correlation (xc) functionals for ensembles.\nFollowing Smith et al. [Phys. Rev. B 93, 245131 (2016)], we propose in this\nwork to construct an exact eDFT for the nontrivial asymmetric Hubbard dimer,\nthus providing more insight into the weight dependence of the ensemble xc\nenergy in various correlation regimes. For that purpose, an exact analytical\nexpression for the weight-dependent ensemble exchange energy has been derived.\nThe complementary exact ensemble correlation energy has been computed by means\nof Legendre--Fenchel transforms. Interesting features like discontinuities in\nthe ensemble xc potential in the strongly correlated limit have been\nrationalized by means of a generalized adiabatic connection formalism. Finally,\nfunctional-driven errors induced by ground-state density-functional\napproximations have been studied. In the strictly symmetric case or in the\nweakly correlated regime, combining ensemble exact exchange with ground-state\ncorrelation functionals gives relatively accurate ensemble energies. However,\nwhen approaching the equiensemble in the strongly correlated regime, this\napproximation leads to highly curved ensemble energies with negative slope\nwhich is unphysical. Using both ground-state exchange and correlation\nfunctionals gives much better results in that case. In fact, exact ensemble\nenergies are almost recovered in some density domains. The analysis of\ndensity-driven errors is left for future work.\n", "  We present new infinite-dimensional spaces of bi-axially symmetric\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions to four-dimensional Vasiliev higher\nspin gravity, obtained by modifications of the Ansatz used in arXiv:1107.1217,\nwhich gave rise to a Type-D solution space. The current Ansatz is based on\ninternal semigroup algebras (without identity) generated by exponentials formed\nout of the bi-axial symmetry generators. After having switched on the vacuum\ngauge function, the resulting generalized Weyl tensor is given by a sum of\ngeneralized Petrov type-D tensors that are Kerr-like or 2-brane-like in the\nasymptotic AdS4 region, and the twistor space connection is smooth in twistor\nspace over finite regions of spacetime. We provide evidence for that the\nlinearized twistor space connection can be brought to Vasiliev gauge.\n", "  In 1965 Paul D. Jose published his discovery that both the motion of the Sun\nabout the center of mass of the solar system and periods comprised of eight\nHale magnetic sunspot cycles with a mean period of ~22.37 years have a matching\nperiodicity of ~179 years. We have investigated the implied link between solar\nbarycentric torque cycles and sunspot cycles and have found that the unsigned\nsolar torque values from 1610 to 2057 are consistently phase and magnitude\ncoherent in ~179 year Jose Cycles. We are able to show that there is also a\nsurprisingly high degree of sunspot cycle phase coherence for times of minima\nin addition to magnitude correlation of peaks between the nine Schwabe sunspot\ncycles of 1878.8 to 1976.1 (SC12 through SC20) and those of 1699 to 1798.3\n(SC[-5] through SC4). We further show that the remaining seven Schwabe cycles\nin each ~179 year cycle are non-coherent. In addition we have analyzed the\nempirical solar motion triggers of both sunspot cycle phase coherence and phase\ndisruption, from which we conclude that sunspot cycles SC28 through SC35 (2057\nto 2143) will be phase coherent at times of minima and amplitude correlated at\nmaxima with SC12 through SC19 (1878.8-1964.8). The resulting predicted start\ntimes +/- 0.9 year, 1 sigma, of future sunspot cycles SC28 to SC36 are\ntabulated.\n", "  Penrose proposed that the big bang singularity should be constrained by\nrequiring that the Weyl curvature vanishes there. The idea behind this past\nhypothesis is attractive because it constrains the initial conditions for the\nuniverse in geometric terms and is not confined to a specific early universe\nparadigm. However, the precise statement of Penrose's hypothesis is tied to\nclassical space-times and furthermore restricts only the gravitational degrees\nof freedom. These are encapsulated only in the tensor modes of the commonly\nused cosmological perturbation theory. Drawing inspiration from the underlying\nidea, we propose a quantum generalization of Penrose's hypothesis using the\nPlanck regime in place of the big bang, and simultaneously incorporating tensor\nas well as scalar modes. Initial conditions selected by this generalization\nconstrain the universe to be as homogeneous and isotropic in the Planck regime\n\\emph{as permitted by the Heisenberg uncertainty relations}.\n", "  The issue of unitary evolution during creation and evaporation of a black\nhole remains controversial. We~argue that some prominent cures are more\ntroubling than the disease, demonstrate that their central element---forming of\nthe event horizon before the evaporation begins---is not necessarily true, and\ndescribe a fully coupled matter-gravity system which is manifestly unitary.\n", "  In this article we examine the dynamics of a colloidal particle driven by a\nmodulated force over a sinusoidal optical potential energy landscape. Coupling\nbetween the competing frequencies of the modulated drive and that of particle\nmotion over the periodic landscape leads to synchronisation of particle motion\ninto discrete modes. This synchronisation manifests as steps in the average\nparticle velocity, with mode locked steps covering a range of average driving\nvelocities. The amplitude and frequency dependence of the steps are considered,\nand compared to results from analytic theory, Langevin Dynamics simulations,\nand Dynamic Density Functional Theory. Furthermore, the critical driving\nvelocity is studied, and simulation used to extend the range of conditions\naccessible in experiments alone. Finally, state diagrams from experiment,\nsimulation, and theory are used to show the extent of the dynamically locked\nmodes in two dimensions, as a function of both the amplitude and frequency of\nthe modulated drive.\n", "  A single crystal S=3/2 perfect kagome lattice antiferromagnet\n$\\mathrm{KCr_3(OH)_6(SO_4)_2}$ (Cr-jarosite) has been studied by X-band and\nhigh-frequency electron spin resonance (ESR). The g-values perpendicular to the\nkagome plane (c-axis) and in the plane are determined to be $g_c=1.9704 \\pm\n0.0002$ and $g_\\xi=1.9720 \\pm 0.0003$, respectively, by high-frequency ESR\nobserved at 265 K. Antiferromagnetic resonances (AFMR) with the\nantiferromagnetic gap of 120 GHz are observed at 1.9 K, which is below\n$T_N$=4.5 K. The analysis of AFMR modes by the conventional molecular field\ntheory shows $d_p=0.27$ K and $d_z=0.07$ K, where $d_p$ and $d_z$ are in-plane\nand out-of-plane components of DM d vector, respectively. From these results\nand the estimated exchange interaction J=6.15 K by Okuta et al., the ground\nstate of Cr-jarosite is discussed in connection with the Monte Carlo\nsimulations result with classical Heisenberg spins on the kagome lattice by\nElhajal et al. Finally, the angular dependence of linewidth and the lineshape\nobserved at 296 K by X-band ESR show typical behavior of a two-dimensional\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet, suggesting a good two-dimensionality of\nCr-jarosite.\n", "  This paper summarises some of the recent progress that has been made in\nunderstanding astrophysical plasma turbulence in the solar wind, from in situ\nspacecraft observations. At large scales, where the turbulence is predominantly\nAlfvenic, measurements of critical balance, residual energy, and 3D structure\nare discussed, along with comparison to recent models of strong Alfvenic\nturbulence. At these scales, a few percent of the energy is also in compressive\nfluctuations, and their nature, anisotropy, and relation to the Alfvenic\ncomponent is described. In the small scale kinetic range, below the ion\ngyroscale, the turbulence becomes predominantly kinetic Alfven in nature, and\nmeasurements of the spectra, anisotropy, and intermittency of this turbulence\nare discussed with respect to recent cascade models. One of the major remaining\nquestions is how the turbulent energy is dissipated, and some recent work on\nthis question, in addition to future space missions which will help to answer\nit, are briefly discussed.\n", "  The discovery of superconducting materials has led to their use in\ntechnological marvels such as magnetic-field sensors in MRI machines, powerful\nresearch magnets, short transmission cables, and high-speed trains. Despite\nsuch applications, the uses of superconductors are not widespread because they\nfunction much below room-temperature, hence the costly cooling. Since the\ndiscovery of Cu- and Fe-based high-temperature superconductors (HTS), much\nintense effort has tried to explain and understand the superconducting\nphenomenon. While no exact explanations are given, several trends are reported\nin relation to the materials basis in magnetism and spin excitations. In fact,\nmost HTS have antiferromagnetic undoped 'parent' materials that undergo a\nsuperconducting transition upon small chemical substitutions in them. As it is\ncurrently unclear which 'dopants' can favor superconductivity, this manuscript\ninvestigates crystal structure changes upon chemical substitutions, to find\nclues in lattice parameters for the superconducting occurrence. We review the\nchemical substitution effects on the crystal lattice of iron-arsenide-based\ncrystals (2008 to present). We note that (a) HTS compounds have nearly\ntetragonal structures with a-lattice parameter close to 4 A, and (b)\nsuperconductivity can depend strongly on the c-lattice parameter changes with\nchemical substitution. For example, a decrease in c-lattice parameter is\nrequired to induce 'in-plane' superconductivity. The review of lattice\nparameter trends in iron-arsenides presented here should guide synthesis of new\nmaterials and provoke theoretical input, giving clues for HTS.\n", "  We examine the structure, propagation and expansion of the shock associated\nwith the 2012 July 23 extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). Characteristics of\nthe shock determined from multi-point imaging observations are compared to in\nsitu measurements at different locations and a complex radio type II burst,\nwhich according to our definition has multiple branches that may not all be\nfundamental-harmonic related. The white-light shock signature can be modeled\nreasonably well by a spherical structure and was expanding backward even on the\nopposite side of the Sun. The expansion of the shock, which was roughly\nself-similar after the first $\\sim$1.5 hours from launch, largely dominated\nover the translation of the shock center for the time period of interest. Our\nstudy also suggests a bow-shock morphology around the nose at later times due\nto the outward motion in combination with the expansion of the ejecta. The\nshock decayed and failed to reach Mercury in the backward direction and STEREO\nB and Venus in the lateral directions, as indicated by the imaging and in situ\nobservations. The shock in the nose direction, however, may persist to the far\nouter heliosphere, with predicted impact on Dawn around 06 UT on July 25 and on\nJupiter around 23:30 UT on July 27 by an MHD model. The type II burst shows\nproperties generally consistent with the spatial/temporal variations of the\nshock deduced from imaging and in situ observations. In particular, the\nlow-frequency bands agree well with the in situ measurements of a very low\ndensity ahead of the shock at STEREO A.\n", "  We consider a numerical approach for the incompressible surface Navier-Stokes\nequation. The approach is based on the covariant form and uses discrete\nexterior calculus (DEC) in space and a semi-implicit discretization in time.\nThe discretization is described in detail and related to finite difference\nschemes on staggered grids in flat space for which we demonstrate second order\nconvergence. We compare computational results with a vorticity-stream function\napproach for surfaces with genus 0 and demonstrate the interplay between\ntopology, geometry and flow properties. Our discretization also allows to\nhandle harmonic vector fields, which we demonstrate on a torus.\n", "  Elementary methods are used to examine some nontrivial mathematical issues\nunderpinning the Lorentz transformation. Its eigen-system is characterized\nthrough the exponential of a $G$-skew symmetric matrix, underlining its\nunconnectedness at one of its extremes (the hyper-singular case). A different\nyet equivalent angle is presented through Pauli coding which reveals the\nconnection between the hyper-singular case and the shear map.\n", "  In this work, we employ the dark matter equations of state (DMEOSs) obtained\nfrom the rotational curves of galaxies as well as the fermionic DMEOS with m =\n1.0 GeV to study the structure of darkmatter admixed neutron stars (DMANSs).\nApplying the equation of state in the Skyrme framework for the neutron matter\n(NM), we calculate the mass-radius relation for different DMANSs with various\nDMEOSs and central pressure of dark matter (DM) to NM ratios. Our results show\nthat for some DMEOSs, the mass-radius relations are in agreement with new\nobservations, e.g. EXO 1745-248, 4U 1608-52, and 4U 1820-30, which are\ninconsistent with the normal neutron stars. We conclude that both DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius\nrelation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which\nleads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM\nsphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results\nconfirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a\nhalo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the\ndifferent degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible\nradius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can be exist. The\ngravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and\ncentral pressure ratios. The results explain that the existence of DM in a\nDMANS leads to higher values of gravitational redshift of the star.\n", "  For the first time a vertically polarized electron beam has been used for\nphysics experiments at MAMI in the energy range between 180 and 855 MeV. The\nbeam-normal single-spin asymmetry $A_{\\mathrm{n}}$, which is a direct probe of\nhigher-order photon exchange beyond the first Born approximation, has been\nmeasured in the reaction $^{12}\\mathrm C(\\vec e,e')^{12}\\mathrm C$. Vertical\npolarization orientation was necessary to measure this asymmetry with the\nexisting experimental setup. In this paper we describe the procedure to orient\nthe electron polarization vector vertically, and the concept of determining\nboth its magnitude and orientation with the available setup. A sophisticated\nmethod has been developed to overcome the lack of a polarimeter setup sensitive\nto the vertical polarization component.\n", "  The quantum duality principle is used to obtain explicitly the Poisson\nanalogue of the kappa-(A)dS quantum algebra in (3+1) dimensions as the\ncorresponding Poisson-Lie structure on the dual solvable Lie group. The\nconstruction is fully performed in a kinematical basis and deformed Casimir\nfunctions are also explicitly obtained. The cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is\nincluded as a Poisson-Lie group contraction parameter, and the limit\n$\\Lambda\\to 0$ leads to the well-known kappa-Poincar\\'e algebra in the\nbicrossproduct basis. A twisted version with Drinfel'd double structure of this\nkappa-(A)dS deformation is sketched.\n", "  Previous studies showed that CsI(Na) crystals have significantly different\nwaveforms between alpha and gamma scintillations. In this work, the light yield\nand PSD capability of CsI(Na) scintillators as a function of the temperature\ndown to 80 K has been studied. As temperature drops, the fast component rises\nand the slow component decreases. By cooling the CsI(Na) crystals, the light\nyield of high ionization events are enhanced significantly, while the light\nyield of background gamma events are suppressed. At 110 K, CsI(Na) crystal\nachieves the optimal balance between low threshold and good background\nrejection performance. The different responses of CsI(Na) to gamma and alpha at\ndifferent temperatures are explained with self-trapped and activator\nluminescence centers.\n", "  We present a general picture of the exciton properties of layered materials\nin terms of the excitations of their single-layer building blocks. To this end,\nwe derive a model excitonic hamiltonian by drawing an analogy with molecular\ncrystals, which are other prototypical van der Waals materials. We employ this\nsimplified model to analyse in detail the excitation spectrum of hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) that we have obtained from the {\\it ab initio} solution of\nthe many-body Bethe-Salpeter equation as a function of momentum. In this way we\nidentify the character of the lowest-energy excitons in hBN, discuss the\neffects of the interlayer hopping and the electron-hole exchange interaction on\nthe exciton dispersion, and illustrate the relation between exciton and plasmon\nexcitations in layered materials.\n", "  Monochromators and analyzers for X-rays of energy $>$ 5 keV are\noverwhelmingly made from silicon crystals, of which large specimens of high\npurity and low defect density are readily available. Germanium and diamond\ncrystals are also occasionally used. Bragg reflection of the X-rays determines\ntheir bandwidth, with backscattering reflections (with Bragg angles $\\approx$\n90$^\\circ$) providing the highest energy resolution along with high photon\ncollection efficiency. The crystal lattices of all these materials share the\nsame space group $Fd\\overline{3}m$, which because of its high symmetry provides\na low density of unique backscattering Bragg reflections per unit photon energy\nrange. This is a disadvantage for solid-state studies using resonant inelastic\nX-ray scattering (RIXS) and nuclear resonant scattering (NRS), for which the\nX-ray energy must be tuned to a specific electronic or nuclear transition. As a\nresult, crystals with lattices of lower symmetry are being considered.\n$\\alpha$-quartz is one of the most promising. However, data on its material\nproperties and fabrication techniques are widely scattered, and in the vital\nmatter of the atomic positions, great inconsistencies exist in the literature.\nThe material properties of $\\alpha$-quartz that are relevant to X-ray studies\nare therefore summarized and clarified here as a guide to future work.\n", "  A Half Bound State (HBS) $\\psi_*(x)$ can be defined as a single, conditional,\nzero-energy, continuous solution of the one dimensional Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nequation for a scattering potential well $V(x)$ ($s.t ~ V(\\pm \\infty)=0$). The\nnon-normalizable and solitary HBS of a potential satisfies Neumann boundary\ncondition that $\\psi'_*(\\pm \\infty)=0$ and it can have $n$ (= 0,1,2,...) number\nof nodes indicating $n$ number of bound states in $V(x)$ below $E=0$. Here we\nshow that starting with a nodeless HBS, we can construct a (supersymmetric)\npair of finite potentials (well, double wells, well-barrier): $V_{\\pm}(x)$\nhaving no bound state and they enclose positive area on $x$-axis. On the\ncontrary their negative counterparts $(-cV_{\\pm}(x)),c>0$ do have at least one\nbound state for any arbitrary positive value of $c$. Furthermore, $c\nV_{\\pm}(x),~ c >0$ which binds positive area on x-axis in conformity with\nSimon's theorem can have at least one bound state only conditionally for\ninstance when $c>1$ or $c>>1$.\n", "  We demonstrate a monolithic frequency converter incorporating up to four\ntuning degrees of freedom, three temperature and one strain, allowing resonance\nof pump and generated wavelengths simultaneous with optimal phase-matching.\nWith a Rb-doped periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP)\nimplementation, we demonstrate efficient continuous-wave second harmonic\ngeneration from 795 nm to 397 nm, with low-power efficiency of 72%/W and\nhigh-power slope efficiency of 4.5%. The measured performance shows good\nagreement with theoretical modeling of the device. We measure optical\nbistability effects, and show how they can be used to improve the stability of\nthe output against pump frequency and amplitude variations.\n", "  In this paper, we use the WKB approximation method to approximately solve a\ndeformed Schrodinger-like differential equation: $\\left[ -\\hbar^{2}\n\\partial_{\\xi}^{2}g^{2}\\left( -i\\hbar\\alpha\\partial_{\\xi}\\right) -p^{2}\\left(\n\\xi\\right) \\right] \\psi\\left( \\xi\\right) =0$, which are frequently dealt with\nin various effective models of quantum gravity, where the parameter $\\alpha$\ncharacterizes effects of quantum gravity. For an arbitrary function $g\\left(\nx\\right) $ satisfying several properties proposed in the paper, we find the WKB\nsolutions, the WKB connection formulas through a turning point, the deformed\nBohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule, and the deformed tunneling rate formula\nthrough a potential barrier. Several examples of applying the WKB approximation\nto the deformed quantum mechanics are investigated. In particular, we calculate\nthe bound states of the P\\\"{o}schl-Teller potential and estimate the effects of\nquantum gravity on the quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole.\nMoreover, the area quantum of the black hole is considered via Bohr's\ncorrespondence principle. Finally, the WKB solutions of the deformed\nWheeler--DeWitt equation for a closed Friedmann universe with a scalar field\nare obtained, and the effects of quantum gravity on the probability of\nsufficient inflation is discussed in the context of the tunneling proposal.\n", "  This work covers electron positron pair production in spatially homogeneous\nelectric (and magnetic) fields. Different field configurations are looked at in\norder to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production,\nSauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The\nmain focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component\nwhich are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via two\nnumerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic\nmethod is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which\nentails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of\nthis equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the\nDHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic\nfields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical\nmethod is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore\ncalled the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to\nunderstand pair production in rotating Sauter pulses. The Wigner method and the\nsemiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each\nother. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the\nrotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for\nexperiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An\ninterpretation of the pair production spectra is given. Due to the general\nnature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field\nconfigurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirp or\nbichromatic rotating Sauter pulses. Each of these exhibit interesting features,\nincluding the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect in bichromatic pulses,\nwhich could be useful in planning high-intensity laser experiments.\n", "  A comprehensive description of ESO in the current global astronomical\ncontext, and its plans for the next decade and beyond, are presented. This\nsurvey covers all aspects of the Organisation, including the optical-infrared\nprogramme at the La Silla Paranal Observatory, the submillimetre facilities\nALMA and APEX, the construction of the 39-metre European Extremely Large\nTelescope and the science operation of these facilities. An extension of the\ncurrent optical/infrared/submillimetre facilities into multi-messenger\nastronomy has been made with the decision to host the southern Cherenkov\nTelescope Array at Paranal. The structure of the Organisation is presented and\nthe further development of the staff is described within the scope of the\nlong-range financial planning. The role of Chile is highlighted and expansion\nof the number of Member States beyond the current 15 is discussed. The\nstrengths of the ESO model, together with challenges as well as possible new\nopportunities and initiatives, are examined and a strategy for the future of\nESO is outlined.\n", "  In this paper we study the propagation in a de Sitter universe of\ngravitational waves generated by perturbating some unspecified spherical\nastrophysical object in the frequencies domain. We obtain the axial and polar\nperturbation equations in a cosmological de Sitter universe in the usual\ncomoving coordinates, the coordinates we occupy in our galaxy. We write down\nthe relevant equations in terms of Laplace transform with respect to the\ncomoving time $t$ instead of the usual Fourier one that is no longer available\nin a cosmological context. Both axial and polar perturbation equations are\nexpressed in terms of a non trivial mixture of retarded-advanced metric\ncoefficients with respect to the Laplace parameter $s$ (complex translation).\nThe axial case is studied in more detail. In particular, the axial\nperturbations can be reduced to a master linear second-order differential\nequation in terms of the Regge-Wheeler function $Z$ where a coupling with a\nretarded $Z$ with respect to the cosmological time $t$ is present. It is shown\nthat a de Sitter expanding universe can change the frequency $\\omega$ of a\ngravitational wave as perceived by a comoving observer. The polar equations are\nmuch more involved. Nevertheless, we show that also the polar perturbations can\nbe expressed in terms of four independent integrable differential equations.\n", "  We explore signatures of the non-Markovianity in the time-resolved energy\ntransfer processes for quantum open systems. Focusing on typical systems such\nas the exact solvable damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the general spin-boson\nmodel, we establish quantitative links between the time-resolved energy current\nand the symmetric logarithmic derivative quantum Fisher information (SLD-QFI)\nflow, one of measures quantifying the non-Markovianity, within the framework of\nnon-Markovian master equations in time-local forms. From the relationships, we\nfind in the damped Jaynes-Cummings model that the SLD-QFI backflow from the\nreservoir to the system always correlates with an energy backflow, thus we can\ndirectly witness the non-Markovianity from the dynamics of the energy current.\nIn the spin-boson model, the relation is built on the rotating-wave\napproximation, calibrated against exact numerical results, and proven reliable\nin the weak coupling regime. We demonstrate that whether the non-Markovianity\nguarantees the occurrence of an energy backflow depends on the bath spectral\nfunction. For the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic cases, we show that no energy backflow\noccurs and the energy current always flow out of the system even in the\nnon-Markovian regime. While in the super-Ohmic case, we observe that the\nnon-Markovian dynamics can induce an energy backflow.\n", "  Zirconium pentatelluride ZrTe$_5$, a fascinating topological material\nplatform, hosts exotic chiral fermions in its highly anisotropic\nthree-dimensional Dirac band and holds great promise advancing the\nnext-generation information technology. However, the origin underlying its\nanomalous resistivity peak has been under debate for decades. Here we provide\ntransport evidence substantiating the anomaly to be a direct manifestation of a\nLifshitz transition in the Dirac band with an ultrahigh carrier mobility\nexceeding 3$\\times$10$^5$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. We demonstrate that the\nLifshitz transition is readily controllable by means of carrier doping, which\nsets the anomaly peak temperature $T_p$. $T_p$ is found to scale approximately\nas $n_H^{0.27}$, where the Hall carrier concentration $n_H$ is linked with the\nFermi level by $\\epsilon_F$ $\\propto$ $n_H^{1/3}$ in a linearly dispersed Dirac\nband. This relation indicates $T_p$ monotonically increases with $\\epsilon_F$,\nwhich serves as an effective knob for fine tuning transport properties in\npentatelluride-based Dirac semimetals.\n", "  We perform the first statistical study of the effects of the interaction of\nsuprathermal electrons with narrow-band whistler mode waves in the solar wind.\nWe show that this interaction does occur and that it is associated with\nenhanced widths of the so called strahl component. The latter is directed along\nthe inter- planetary magnetic field away from the Sun. We do the study by\ncomparing the strahl pitch angle widths in the solar wind at 1AU in the absence\nof large scale discontinuities and transient structures, such as interplanetary\nshocks, interplanetary coronal mass ejections, stream interaction regions, etc.\nduring times when the whistler mode waves were present and when they were\nabsent. This is done by using the data from two Cluster instruments: STAFF data\nin frequency range between ~0.1 Hz and ~200 Hz were used for determining the\nwave properties and PEACE datasets at twelve central energies between ~57 eV\n(equivalent to ~10 typical electron thermal energies in the solar wind, E_T )\nand ~676 eV (~113 E_T ) for pitch angle measurements. Statistical analysis\nshows that during the inter- vals with the whistler waves the strahl component\non average exhibits pitch angle widths between 2 and 12 degrees larger than\nduring the intervals when these waves are not present. The largest difference\nis obtained for the electron central energy of ~344 eV (~57 E_T ).\n", "  We present the results of Gaussian-based ground-state and excited-state\nequation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory with single and double excitations\nfor three-dimensional solids. We focus on diamond and silicon, which are\nparadigmatic covalent semiconductors. In addition to ground-state properties\n(the lattice constant, bulk modulus, and cohesive energy), we compute the\nquasiparticle band structure and band gap. We sample the Brillouin zone with up\nto 64 k-points using norm-conserving pseudopotentials and polarized double- and\ntriple-zeta basis sets, leading to canonical coupled-cluster calculations with\nas many as 256 electrons in 2,176 orbitals.\n", "  We consider implementations of high-order finite difference Weighted\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for the Euler equations in\ncylindrical and spherical coordinate systems with radial dependence only. The\nmain concern of this work lies in ensuring both high-order accuracy and\nconservation. Three different spatial discretizations are assessed: one that is\nshown to be high-order accurate but not conservative, one conservative but not\nhigh-order accurate, and a new approach that is both high-order accurate and\nconservative. For cylindrical and spherical coordinates, we present convergence\nresults for the advection equation and the Euler equations with an acoustics\nproblem; we then use the Sod shock tube and the Sedov point-blast problems in\ncylindrical coordinates to verify our analysis and implementations.\n", "  A promising approach in designing composite materials with unusual physical\nbehavior combines solid nanostructures and orientationally ordered soft matter\nat the mesoscale. Such composites not only inherit properties of their\nconstituents but also can exhibit emergent behavior, such as ferromagnetic\nordering of colloidal metal nanoparticles forming mesoscopic magnetization\ndomains when dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal. Here we demonstrate the\noptical patterning of domain structures and topological defects in such\nferromagnetic liquid crystal colloids, which allows for altering their response\nto magnetic fields. Our findings reveal the nature of the defects in this soft\nmatter system which is different as compared to non-polar nematics and\nferromagnets alike.\n", "  We demonstrate facile optical manipulation of shape of birefringent colloidal\nmicroparticles made from liquid crystal elastomers. Using soft lithography and\npolymerization, we fabricate elastomeric microcylinders with weakly undulating\ndirector oriented on average along their long axes. These particles are\ninfiltrated with gold nanospheres acting as heat transducers that allow for an\nefficient localized transfer of heat from a focused infrared laser beam to a\nsubmicrometer region within a microparticle. Photothermal control of ordering\nin the liquid crystal elastomer using scanned beams allows for a robust control\nof colloidal particles, enabling both reversible and irreversible changes of\nshape. Possible applications include optomechanics, microfluidics, and\nreconfigurable colloidal composites with shape-dependent self-assembly.\n", "  Trilepton event represents one of the probes of the new physics at high\nenergy colliders. In this talk, we consider the search for processes with final\nstates $\\ell_{\\alpha}^{\\pm }\\ell_{\\beta}^{\\pm}\\ell_{\\gamma}^{\\mp}$ +\n$\\slashed{E}_{T}$ where\n  ${\\alpha}$, ${\\beta}$, ${\\gamma}$= $e,\\mu,\\tau$, via the production of\nsinglet charged scalar $S^{\\pm}$ which arise in a class of radiative neutrino\nmass models. We discuss the opposite sign same flavor leptons signal, as well\nas the background free channel in view to get a significant excess at\n$\\sqrt{s}$= 8 TeV and $\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV at the hadron collider LHC.\n", "  We discuss the data-pattern tomography for reconstruction of entangled states\nof light. We show that for a moderate number of probe coherent states it is\npossible to achieve high accuracy of representation not only for single-mode\nstates but also for two-mode entangled states. We analyze the stability of\nthese representations to the noise and demonstrate the conservation of the\npurity and entanglement. Simulating the probe and signal measurements, we show\nthat systematic error inherent for representation of realistic signal response\nwith finite sets of responses from probe states still allows one to infer\nreliably the signal states preserving entanglement.\n", "  Estimating the angular separation between two incoherently radiating\nmonochromatic point sources is a canonical toy problem to quantify spatial\nresolution in imaging. In recent work, Tsang {\\em et al.} showed, using a\nFisher Information analysis, that Rayleigh's resolution limit is just an\nartifact of the conventional wisdom of intensity measurement in the image\nplane. They showed that the optimal sensitivity of estimating the angle is only\na function of the total photons collected during the camera's integration time\nbut entirely independent of the angular separation itself no matter how small\nit is, and found the information-optimal mode basis, intensity detection in\nwhich achieves the aforesaid performance. We extend the above analysis, which\nwas done for a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) to a hard-aperture pupil\nproving the information optimality of image-plane sinc-Bessel modes, and\ngeneralize the result further to an arbitrary PSF. We obtain new\ncounterintuitive insights on energy vs. information content in spatial modes,\nand extend the Fisher Information analysis to exact calculations of minimum\nmean squared error, both for Gaussian and hard aperture pupils.\n", "  We consider the minimal Standard Model as an effective low-energy description\nof an unspecified fundamental theory with spontaneously broken conformal\nsymmetry. The effective theory exhibits classical scale invariance which\nmanifest itself through the dilaton field. The mass of the dilaton is generated\nvia the quantum scale anomaly at two-loop level and is proportional to the\ntechically stable hierarchy between the electroweak scale and a high energy\nscale given by a dilaton vacuum expectation value. We find that a generic\nprediction of this class of models is the existence of a very light dilaton\nwith mass between $\\sim 0.01$ $\\mu$eV to $\\sim 100$ MeV, depending on the\nhierarchy of scales. Searches for such a light scalar particle may reveal a\nfundamental role of conformal invariance in nature.\n", "  Couder and Fort discovered that droplets walking on a vibrating bath possess\ncertain features previously thought to be exclusive to quantum systems. These\nmillimetric droplets synchronize with their Faraday wavefield, creating a\nmacroscopic pilot-wave system. In this paper we exploit the fact that the waves\ngenerated are nearly monochromatic and propose a hydrodynamic model capable of\nquantitatively capturing the interaction between bouncing drops and a variable\ntopography. We show that our reduced model is able to reproduce some important\nexperiments involving the drop-topography interaction, such as non-specular\nreflection and single-slit diffraction.\n", "  Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL), e.g. air-conditioners and heaters,\nare by far the most wide-spread consumers of electricity. Normally the devices\nare calibrated to provide the so-called bang-bang control of temperature --\nchanging from on to off, and vice versa, depending on temperature. Aggregation\nof a large group of similar devices into a statistical ensemble is considered,\nwhere the devices operate following the same dynamics subject to stochastic\nperturbations and randomized, Poisson on/off switching policy. We analyze,\nusing theoretical and computational tools of statistical physics, how the\nensemble relaxes to a stationary distribution and establish relation between\nthe relaxation and statistics of the probability flux, associated with devices'\ncycling in the mixed (discrete, switch on/off, and continuous, temperature)\nphase space. This allowed us to derive and analyze spectrum of the\nnon-equilibrium (detailed balance broken) statistical system and uncover how\nswitching policy affects oscillatory trend and speed of the relaxation.\nRelaxation of the ensemble is of a practical interest because it describes how\nthe ensemble recovers from significant perturbations, e.g. forceful temporary\nswitching off aimed at utilizing flexibility of the ensemble in providing\n\"demand response\" services relieving consumption temporarily to balance larger\npower grid. We discuss how the statistical analysis can guide further\ndevelopment of the emerging demand response technology.\n", "  Arrays of identical and individually addressable qubits lay the foundation\nfor the creation of scalable quantum hardware such as quantum processors and\nrepeaters. Silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV) offer excellent physical\nproperties such as low inhomogeneous broadening, fast photon emission, and a\nlarge Debye-Waller factor, while the possibility for all-optical ultrafast\nmanipulation and techniques to extend the spin coherence times make them very\npromising candidates for qubits. Here, we have developed arrays of nanopillars\ncontaining single SiV centers with high yield, and we demonstrate ultrafast\nall-optical complete coherent control of the state of a single SiV center. The\nhigh quality of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown SiV centers provides\nexcellent spectral stability, which allows us to coherently manipulate and\nquasi-resonantly read out the state of individual SiV centers on picosecond\ntimescales using ultrafast optical pulses. This work opens new opportunities\ntowards the creation of a scalable on-chip diamond platform for quantum\ninformation processing and scalable nanophotonics applications.\n", "  The structures, point defects and impacts of fission products for U3Si\n(\\b{eta}-U3Si and {\\gamma}-U3Si) and USi2 ({\\alpha}-USi2 and \\b{eta}-USi2) are\nstudied by first-principles calculations. The lattice parameters of U3Si and\nUSi2 are calculated and the stability of different types of point defects is\npredicted by their formation energies. The results show that silicon vacancies\nare more prone to be produced than uranium vacancies in \\b{eta}-USi2 matrix,\nwhile uranium vacancies are the most stable defects of other three types of\ncrystallographic structures. The most favorable sites of fission products\n(strontium, barium, cerium and neodymium) are determined in this work as well.\nBy calculating incorporation energies of fission products, we demonstrate that\nthe uranium site is the most favored for all the fissions products. Comparing\nthe structural changes influenced by different fission products, it is also\nfound that the highest volume change is caused by barium interstitials.\nAccording to the current data, rare earth elements cerium and neodymium are\nfound to be more stable than alkaline earth metals strontium and barium in a\ngiven nuclear matrix. Finally, it is also determined that in USi2 crystal\nlattice fission products tend to be stabilized in uranium substitution sites,\nwhile they are likely to form precipitates from the U3Si matrix. It is expected\nthat this work may provide new insight into the mechanism for structural\nevolutions of silicide nuclear fuels in a reactor.\n", "  The origin of the activity in the solar corona is a long-standing problem in\nsolar physics. Recent satellite observations, such as Hinode, Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO), Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), show the\ndetail characteristics of the solar atmosphere and try to reveal the energy\ntransfer from the photosphere to the corona through the magnetic fields and its\nenergy conversion by various processes. However, quantitative estimation of\nenergy transfer along the magnetic field is not enough. There are mainly two\nreason why it is difficult to observe the energy transfer from photosphere to\ncorona; 1) spatial resolution gap between photosphere (a few 0.1 arcsec) and\ncorona (a few arcsec), 2) lack in temperature coverage. Furthermore, there is\nnot enough observational knowledge of the physical parameters in the energy\ndissipation region. There are mainly three reason why it is difficult to\nobserve in the vicinity of the energy dissipation region; 1) small spatial\nscale, 2) short time scale, 3) low emission. It is generally believed that the\nenergy dissipation occurs in the very small scale and its duration is very\nshort (10 second). Further, the density in the dissipation region might be very\nlow. Therefore, the high spatial and temporal resolution UV/EUV spectroscopic\nobservation with wide temperature coverage is crucial to estimate the energy\ntransport from photosphere to corona quantitatively and diagnose the plasma\ndynamics in the vicinity of the energy dissipation region. Main Science Target\nfor the telescope is quantitative estimation for the energy transfer from the\nphotosphere to the corona, and clarification of the plasma dynamics in the\nvicinity of the energy dissipation region, where is the key region for coronal\nheating, solar wind acceleration, and/or solar flare, by the high spatial and\ntemporal resolution UV/EUV spectroscopy.\n", "  We examine theoretically a new idea for spatial and temporal control of\nchemical reactions. When chemical reactions take place in a mixture of\nsolvents, an external electric field can alter the local mixture composition\nthereby accelerating or decelerating the rate of reaction. The spatial\ndistribution of electric field strength can be non-trivial and depends on the\narrangement of the electrodes producing it. In the absence of electric field,\nthe mixture is homogeneous and the reaction takes place uniformly in the\nreactor volume. When an electric field is applied the solvents separate and\nreactants are concentrated in the same phase or separate to different phases,\ndepending on their relative miscibility in the solvents, and this can have a\nlarge effect on the kinetics of the reaction. This method could provide an\nalternative way to control runaway reactions and to increase the reaction rate\nwithout using catalysts.\n", "  We performed a global study on the timing and spectral properties of type-B\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the outbursts of black hole X-ray\nbinaries. The sample is built based on the observations of {\\it Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer}, via searching in the literature in RXTE era for all the\nidentified type-B QPOs. To enlarge the sample, we also investigated some type-B\nQPOs that are reported but not yet fully identified. Regarding to the time lag\nand hard/soft flux ratio, we found that the sources with type-B QPOs behave in\ntwo subgroups. In one subgroup, type-B QPO shows a hard time lag that firstly\ndecreases and then reverse into a soft time lag along with softening of the\nenergy spectrum. In the other subgroup, type-B QPOs distribute only in a small\nregion with hard time lag and relatively soft hardness. These findings may be\nunderstood with a diversity of the homogeneity showing up for the hot inner\nflow of different sources. We confirm the universality of a positive relation\nbetween the type-B QPO frequency and the hard component luminosity in different\nsources. We explain the results by considering that the type-B QPO photons are\nproduced in the inner accretion flow around the central black hole, under a\nlocal Eddington limit. Using this relationship, we derived an mass estimation\nof $9.3-27.1$ $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ for the black hole in H 1743-322.\n", "  This paper is a contribution to semiclassical analysis for abstract\nSchr\\\"odinger type operators on locally compact spaces: Let $X$ be a metrizable\nseperable locally compact space, let $\\mu$ be a Radon measure on $X$ with a\nfull support. Let $(t,x,y)\\mapsto p(t,x,y)$ be a strictly positive pointwise\nconsistent $\\mu$-heat kernel, and assume that the generator $H_p\\geq 0$ of the\ncorresponding self-adjoint contraction semigroup in $L^2(X,\\mu)$ induces a\nregular Dirichlet form. Then, given a function $\\Psi : (0,1)\\to (0,\\infty)$\nsuch that the limit $\\lim_{t\\to 0+}p(t,x,x)\\Psi (t)$ exists for all $x\\in X$,\nwe prove that for every potential $w:X\\to \\mathbb{R}$ one has $$ \\lim_{t \\to\n0+} \\Psi (t)\\mathrm{tr}\\big(\\mathrm{e}^{ -t H_p + w}\\big)= \\int\n\\mathrm{e}^{-w(x) }\\lim_{t \\to 0+}p(t,x,x) \\Psi (t) d\\mu(x)<\\infty $$ for the\nSchr\\\"odinger type operator $H_p + w$, provided $w$ satisfies very mild\nconditions at $\\infty$, that are essentially only made to guarantee that the\nsum of quadratic forms $ H_p + w/t$ is self-adjoint and bounded from below for\nsmall $t$, and to guarantee that $$\n  \\int \\mathrm{e}^{-w(x) }\\lim_{t\\to 0+}p(t,x,x) \\Psi (t) d\\mu(x)<\\infty. $$\nThe proof is probabilistic and relies on a principle of not feeling the\nboundary for $p(t,x,x)$. In particular, this result implies a new semiclassical\nlimit result for partition functions valid on arbitrary connected geodesically\ncomplete Riemannian manifolds, and one also recovers a previously established\nsemiclassical limit result for possibly locally infinite connected weighted\ngraphs.\n", "  The measurement of the tunneling time (T-time) in today's attosecond and\nstrong field (low-frequency) experiments, despite its controversial discussion,\noffers a fruitful opportunity to understand time measurement and the time in\nquantum mechanics. In addition, as we will see in this work, a related\ncontroversial issue is the particulate nature of the radiation. Different\nmodels used to calculate the T-time will be discussed in this work in relation\nto my model of real T-time, Phys. Rev. {\\bf 92}, 052118 (2015), where an\nintriguing similarity to the Bohr-Einstein photon box Gedanken experiment was\nfound. The tunneling process itself is still not well understood, but I am\narguing that a scattering mechanism (by the laser wave packet) offers a\npossibility to understand the tunneling process in the tunneling region. This\nis related to the question about the corpuscular nature of light which is\nwidely discussed in modern quantum optics experiments.\n", "  Amorphous solids or glasses are known to exhibit stretched-exponential decay\nover broad time intervals in several of their macroscopic observables:\nintermediate scattering function, dielectric relaxation modulus, time-elastic\nmodulus etc. This behaviour is prominent especially near the glass transition.\nIn this Letter we show, on the example of dielectric relaxation, that\nstretched-exponential relaxation is intimately related to the peculiar lattice\ndynamics of glasses. By reformulating the Lorentz model of dielectric matter in\na more general form, we express the dielectric response as a function of the\nvibrational density of states (DOS) for a random assembly of spherical\nparticles interacting harmonically with their nearest-neighbours. Surprisingly\nwe find that near the glass transition for this system (which coincides with\nthe Maxwell rigidity transition), the dielectric relaxation is perfectly\nconsistent with stretched-exponential behaviour with Kohlrausch exponents $0.56\n< \\beta < 0.65$, which is the range where exponents are measured in most\nexperimental systems. Crucially, the root cause of stretched-exponential\nrelaxation can be traced back to soft modes (boson-peak) in the DOS.\n", "  The DAMPE (DArk Matter Particle Explorer) satellite was launched on December\n17, 2015 and started its data taking operation a few days later.\n  DAMPE has a large geometric factor ($\\sim~0.3\\ m^2\\ sr$) and provides good\ntracking, calorimetric and charge measurements for electrons, gammas rays and\nnuclei. This will allow precise measurement of cosmic ray spectra from tens of\n$GeV$ up to about $100\\ TeV$. In particular, the energy region between $1-100\\\nTeV$ will be explored with higher precision compared to previous experiments.\nThe various subdetectors allow an efficient identification of the electron\nsignal over the large (mainly proton-induced) background. As a result, the\nall-electron spectrum will be measured with excellent resolution from few $GeV$\nup to few $TeV$, thus giving the opportunity to identify possible contribution\nof nearby sources. A report on the mission goals and status is presented,\ntogether with the on-orbit detector performance and the first data coming from\nspace.\n", "  It has been well established in the past decades that the central black hole\nmasses of galaxies correlate with dynamical properties of their harbouring\nbulges. This notion begs the question of whether there are causal connections\nbetween the AGN and its immediate vicinity in the host galaxy. In this paper we\nanalyse the presence of circumnuclear star formation in a sample of 15 AGN\nusing mid-infrared observations. The data consist of a set of 11.3{\\mm} PAH\nemission and reference continuum images, taken with ground based telescopes,\nwith sub-arcsecond resolution. By comparing our star formation estimates with\nAGN accretion rates, derived from X-ray luminosities, we investigate the\nvalidity of theoretical predictions for the AGN-starburst connection. Our main\nresults are: i) circumnuclear star formation is found, at distances as low as\ntens of parsecs from the nucleus, in nearly half of our sample (7/15); ii) star\nformation luminosities are correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the AGN\n($L_{AGN}$) only for objects with $L_{AGN} \\ge 10^{42}\\,\\,{\\rm erg\\,\\,s^{-1}}$;\niii) low luminosity AGNs ($L_{AGN} < 10^{42}\\,\\,{\\rm erg\\,\\,s^{-1}}$) seem to\nhave starburst luminosities far greater than their bolometric luminosities.\n", "  Plasmons in low-dimensional systems respresent an important tool for coupling\nenergy into nanostructures and the localization of energy on the scale of only\na few nanometers. Contrary to ordinary surface plasmons of metallic bulk\nmaterials, their dispersion goes to zero in the long wavelength limit, thus\ncovering a broad range of energies from terahertz to near infrared, and from\nmesoscopic wavelengths down to just a few nanometers. Using specific and most\ncharacteristic examples, we review first the properties of plasmons in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) metallic layers from an experimental point of view. As\ndemonstrated, tuning of their dispersion is possible by changes of charge\ncarrier concentration in the partially filled 2D conduction bands, but for the\nrelativistic electron gas like in graphene only in the long wavelength limit.\nFor short wavelengths, on the other hand, the dispersion turns out to be\nindependent of the position of the Fermi level with respect to the Dirac point.\nA linear dispersion, seen under the latter conditions in graphene, can also be\nobtained in non-relativistic electron gases by coupling between 2D and 3D\nelectronic systems. As a well investigated example, the acoustic surface\nplasmons in Shockley surface states, coupled with the bulk electronic system,\nare discussed. Also the introduction of anisotropy, e.g. by regular arrays of\nsteps, seems to result in linearization (and to partial localization of the\nplasmons normal to the steps, depending on wavelengths). In quasi-one\ndimensional (1D) systems, such as arrays of gold chains on regularly stepped Si\nsurfaces, only the dispersion is 1D, whereas shape and slope of the dispersion\ncurves depend on the 2D distribution of charge within each terrace and on\ncoupling between wires on different terraces.\n", "  This set of lecture notes forms the basis of a series of lectures delivered\nat the 48th IFF Spring School 2017 on Topological Matter: Topological\nInsulators, Skyrmions and Majoranas at Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany. The\nfirst part of the lecture notes covers the basics of abelian and non-abelian\nanyons and their realization in the Kitaev's honeycomb model. The second part\ndiscusses how to perform universal quantum computation using Majorana fermions.\n", "  MESSENGER magnetometer data show that Mercury's magnetic field is not only\nexceptionally weak but also has a unique geometry. The internal field resembles\nan axial dipole that is offset to the North by 20% of the planetary radius.\nThis implies that the axial quadrupol is particularly strong while the dipole\ntilt is likely below 0.8 degree. The close proximity to the sun in combination\nwith the weak internal field results in a very small and highly dynamic Hermean\nmagnetosphere. We review the current understanding of Mercury's internal and\nexternal magnetic field and discuss possible explanations. Classical convection\ndriven core dynamos have a hard time to reproduce the observations. Strong\nquadrupol contributions can be promoted by different measures, but they always\ngo along with a large dipole tilt and generally rather small scale fields. A\nstably stratified outer core region seems required to explain not only the\nparticular geometry but also the weakness of the Hermean magnetic field. New\ninterior models suggest that Mercury's core likely hosts an iron snow zone\nunderneath the core-mantle boundary. The positive radial sulfur gradient likely\nto develop in such a zone would indeed promote stable stratification. However,\neven dynamo models that include the stable layer show Mercury-like magnetic\nfields only for a fraction of the total simulation time. Large scale variations\nin the core-mantle boundary heat flux promise to yield more persistent results\nbut are not compatible with the current understanding of Mercury's lower\nmantle.\n", "  The number of students who travel abroad to study or are enrolled in a\ndistance learning program outside their home country is growing. According to\nUNESCO, such students are called internationally mobile students (IMSs) and 5\ndestination countries accounted for almost 50% of IMSs: United States (18%),\nUnited Kingdom (11%), France (7%), Australia (6%), and Germany (5%).\nInternationalisation of the higher education has created the so-called\nborderless university, providing better opportunities for learning and\nincreases the human and social sustainability. In this paper, we propose an\nonline system to support transnational education (TNE) in Australia. This\nsystem will consist of both an online module and quiz, and an automated\nassistance module. The first part will ensure that students understand\nTNE-related potential problems, such as the importance of submission deadlines,\nand provide students early hints and help to avoid the TNE-related problems.\nThe second part will provide assistance with general issues related to studying\nand living in Australia, and more specific ones tailored to a specific\ninstitution. The ability to provide an immediate response when required will\nhelp overcome feelings of isolation, and provide appropriate advice on matters\nsuch as plagiarism and related issues, many of which arise from\nmisunderstandings due to divergent cultural backgrounds and a lack of awareness\nabout differences in socio-cultural environments.\n", "  Second order corrections to the perturbative ground state wave functional and\nvacuum energy of a Yang-Mills theory are calculated in the temporal gauge.\nUsing dimensional regularization, the concepts of renormalization and a running\ncoupling constant are motivated in a spatially gauge invariant way, before the\nintroduction of a scalar product. After definition of a scalar product, it is\nshown that the renormalization constants of this approach are just those of the\nAxial gauge.\n", "  Te NMR studies were carried out for the bismuth telluride topological\ninsulator in a wide range from room temperature down to 12.5 K. The\nmeasurements were made on a Bruker Avance 400 pulse spectrometer. The NMR\nspectra were collected for the mortar and pestle powder sample and for single\ncrystalline stacks with orientations c parallel and perpendicular to field. The\nactivation energy responsible for thermal activation. The spectra for the stack\nwith c parallel to field showed some particular behavior below 91 K.\n", "  One of the hallmarks of active matter is its rich nonlinear dynamics and\ninstabilities. Recent numerical simulations of phototactic algae showed that a\nthin jet of swimmers, obtained from hydrodynamic focusing inside a Poiseuille\nflow, was unstable to longitudinal perturbations with swimmers dynamically\nclustering (Jibuti et al., Phys. Rev. E, 90, 2014). As a simple starting point\nto understand these instabilities, we consider in this paper an initially\nhomogeneous one-dimensional line of aligned swimmers moving along the same\ndirection, and characterise its instability using both a continuum framework\nand a discrete approach. In both cases, we show that hydrodynamic interactions\nbetween the swimmers lead to instabilities in density for which we compute the\ngrowth rate analytically. Lines of pusher-type swimmers are predicted to remain\nstable while lines of pullers (such as flagellated algae) are predicted to\nalways be unstable.\n", "  We report on the heterogeneous nucleation of catalyst-free InAs nanowires on\nSi (111) substrates by chemical beam epitaxy. We show that nanowire nucleation\nis enhanced by sputtering the silicon substrate with energetic particles. We\nargue that particle bombardment introduces lattice defects on the silicon\nsurface that serve as preferential nucleation sites. The formation of these\nnucleation sites can be controlled by the sputtering parameters, allowing the\ncontrol of nanowire density in a wide range. Nanowire nucleation is accompanied\nby unwanted parasitic islands, but by careful choice of annealing and growth\ntemperature allows to strongly reduce the relative density of these islands and\nto realize samples with high nanowire yield.\n", "  Magnetic turbulence in the solar wind is treated from the point of view of\nelectrodynamics. This can be done based on the use of Poynting's theorem\nattributing all turbulent dynamics to the spectrum of turbulent conductivity.\nFor two directions of propagation of the turbulent fluctuations of the\nelectromagnetic field with respect to the mean plus external magnetic fields an\nexpression is constructed for the spectrum of turbulent dissipation. Use of\nsolar wind observations of electromagnetic power spectral densities in the\ninertial subrange then allows determination of the conductivity spectrum, the\ndissipative response function, in this range. It requires observations of the\ncomplete electromagnetic spectral energy densities including electric power\nspectral densities. The dissipative response function and dispersion relation\nof solar wind inertial range magnetic turbulence are obtained. The dispersion\nrelation indicates the spatial scale decay with increasing frequency providing\nindependent support for the use of Taylor's hypothesis. The dissipation\nfunction indicates an approximate shot-noise spectrum of turbulent resistivity\nin the inertial range suggesting progressive structure formation in the\ninertial range which hints on the presence of discrete mode turbulence and\nnonlinear resonances.\n", "  This paper explores the classification of parameter spaces for\nreaction-diffusion systems of two chemical species on stationary domains. The\ndynamics of the system are explored both in the absence and presence of\ndiffusion. The parameter space is fully classified in terms of the types and\nstability of the uniform steady state. In the absence of diffusion the results\non the classification of parameter space are supported by simulations of the\ncorresponding vector-field and some trajectories around the uniform steady\nstate. In the presence of diffusion, the main findings are the quantitative\nanalysis relating the domain-size with the reaction and diffusion rates and\ntheir corresponding influence on the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion system\nwhen perturbed in the neighbourhood of the uniform steady state. Theoretical\npredictions are supported by numerical simulations both in the presence as well\nas in the absence of diffusion. Conditions on the domain size with respect to\nthe diffusion and reaction rates are related to the types of diffusion-driven\ninstabilities namely Turing, Hopf and Transcritical types of bifurcations. The\nfirst condition is an upper bound on the area of a rectangular domain in terms\nof the diffusion and reaction rates, which forbids the existence of Hopf and\nTranscritical types of bifurcations, yet allowing Turing type instability to\noccur. The second condition (necessary) is a lower bound on the domain size in\nterms of the reaction and diffusion rates to give rise to Hopf and\nTranscritical types of bifurcations as well as Turing instability.\n", "  This chapter summarizes our current understanding of the ionosphere of\nSaturn. We give an overview of Saturn ionospheric science from the Voyager era\nto the present, with a focus on the wealth of new data and discoveries enabled\nby Cassini, including a massive increase in the number of electron density\naltitude profiles. We discuss recent ground-based detection of the effect of\n\"ring rain\" on Saturn's ionosphere, and present possible model interpretations\nof the observations. Finally, we outline current model-data discrepancies and\nindicate how future observations can help in advancing our understanding of the\nvarious controlling physical and chemical processes.\n", "  We show how the Zak $kq$-representation can be adapted to deal with\npseudo-bosons, and under which conditions. Then we use this representation to\nprove completeness of a discrete set of bi-coherent states constructed by means\nof pseudo-bosonic operators.
