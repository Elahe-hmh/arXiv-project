magic nuclei are considered in more detail. The phonon-particle coupling
effects are analyzed including the so-called tadpole term.

similarities between several two-dimensional (2D) fermion systems, including
diluted two-dimensional electron liquids in semiconductors, 3He monolayers, and
layered organic charge-transfer salts. These experimental results, together
with recent theoretical advances, provide compelling evidence that strong
electronic correlations - Wigner-Mott physics - dominate the universal features
of the corresponding metal-insulator transitions (MIT). Here we review the
recent theoretical work exploring quantum criticality of Mott and Wigner-Mott
transitions, and argue that most puzzling features of the experiments find
natural and physically transparent interpretation based on this perspective.

scheme, featuring both bulk and surface radiation damage effects, for the
analysis of silicon detectors aimed at the High Luminosity LHC. In particular,
a surface damage model has been developed by introducing the relevant
parameters (NOX, NIT) extracted from experimental measurements carried out on
p-type substrate test structures after gamma irradiations at doses in the range
10-500 Mrad(Si). An extended bulk model, by considering impact ionization and
deep-level cross-sections variation, was included as well. The model has been
validated through the comparison of the simulation findings with experimental
measurements carried out at very high fluences (2 10^16 1 MeV equivalent
n/cm^2) thus fostering the application of this TCAD approach for the design and
optimization of the new generation of silicon detectors to be used in future
HEP experiments.

in Buckingham's grain-shearing (GS) model [Buckingham, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 108,
2796-2815 (2000)] is identified as the property of rheopecty. The property
corresponds to a rare type of a non-Newtonian fluid in rheology which has
largely remained unexplored. The material impulse response function from the GS
model is found to be similar to the power-law memory kernel which is inherent
in the framework of fractional calculus. The compressional wave equation and
the shear wave equation derived from the GS model are shown to take the form of
the Kelvin-Voigt fractional-derivative wave equation and the fractional
diffusion-wave equation respectively. Therefore, an analogy is drawn between
the dispersion relations obtained from the fractional framework and those from
the GS model to establish the equivalence of the respective wave equations.
Further, a physical interpretation of the characteristic fractional order
present in the wave equations is inferred from the GS model. The overall goal
is to show that fractional calculus is not just a mathematical framework which
can be used to curve-fit the complex behavior of materials. Rather, it can also
be derived from real physical processes as illustrated in this work by the
example of grain-shearing.

  arXiv:1409.3371</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  The elastic collision between two H-like atoms utilizing an ab-initio
static-exchange model (SEM) in the center of mass (CM) frame considering the
system as a four-body Coulomb problem where all the Coulomb interaction terms
in the direct and exchange channels are treated exactly, is studied thoroughly.
A coupled-channel methodology in momentum space is used to solve
Lippman-Schwinger equation following the integral approach. The new SEM code
[1-5] in which the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) scattering amplitude acts as input to
derive the SEM amplitude using partial wave analysis, is utilized to study the
s-, p-, d- wave elastic phase shifts and the corresponding partial cross
sections. An augmented-Born approximation is used to include the contribution
of higher partial waves more accurately to determine the total/integrated
elastic cross sections. The effective range theory is used to determine the
scattering lengths and effective ranges in the s-wave elastic scattering. The
systems studied are Ps-Ps, Ps-Mu, Ps-H, Ps-D, Ps-T, Mu-Mu, Mu-H, Mu-D, Mu-T,
H-H, H-D, H-T, D-D, D-T, T-T. The SEM includes the non-adiabatic short-range
effects due to exchange. The MSEM code [1] is used to study the effect of the
long-range van der Waals interaction due to induced dipole polarizabilities of
the atoms in H(1s)-H(1s) elastic collision. The dependence of scattering length
on the reduced mass of the system and the dependence of scattering length on
the strength of long-range van der Waals interaction that varies with the
minimum interatomic distance are observed [3].

generated by a normal conductor, here a tunnel junction placed at ultra-low
temperature, can be non-classical. By measuring the quadratures of the
electromagnetic field at one or two frequencies in the GHz range, we
demonstrate the existence of squeezing as well as entanglement in such
radiation. In one experiment, we observe that the variance of one quadrature of
the photo-assisted noise generated by the junction goes below its vacuum level.
In the second experiment, we demonstrate the existence of correlations between
the quadratures taken at two frequencies, which can be stronger than allowed by
classical mechanics, proving that the radiation at those two frequencies are
entangled.

Traditional organic
solvents easily reach the atmosphere as they have high vapor pressure and are
linked to a host of negative environmental effects including climate change,
urban air-quality and human illness. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL), on
the other hand, have low vapor pressure and are not flammable or explosive,
thereby resulting in fewer environmental burdens and health hazards. However,
their life cycle environmental impacts as well as freshwater ecotoxicity
implications are poorly understood. RTILs are molten salts that exist as
liquids at relatively low temperatures and have unique properties. Ionic
liquids consist of a large organic cation and charge-delocalized inorganic or
organic anion of smaller size and asymmetric shape. The organic cation can
undergo unlimited structural variations through modification of the alkyl
groups attached to the side chain of the base cation skeleton and most of these
structural variations are feasible, from chemical synthesis point of view, due
to the easy nature of preparation of their components. Functionally, ionic
liquids can be tuned to impart specific desired properties by switching
anions/cations or by incorporating functionalities into the cations/anions. It
is estimated that theoretically more than a trillion ionic liquid structures
can be formed. Due to their tunable nature, these molten salts have the
potential to be used as solvents for variety of applications.

cities makes it possible to build models formalized at the level of the single
retailer. Current models tackle consumer location choices at an aggregate level
and the opportunity new data offers for modeling at the retail unit level lacks
a theoretical framework. The model we present here helps to address these
issues. It is a particular case of the Cross-Nested Logit model, based on
random utility theory built with the idea of quantifying the role of floor
space and agglomeration in retail location choice. We test this model on the
city of London: the results are consistent with a super linear scaling of a
retailer's attractiveness with its floor space, and with an agglomeration
effect approximated as the total retail floorspace within a $325m$ radius from
each shop.

quark propagators. Quark propagators are typically obtained with a linear
equation solver utilizing HPC machines. The CCS QCD Benchmark is a benchmark
program solving the Wilson-Clover quark propagator, and is developed at the
Center for Computational Sciences (CCS), University of Tsukuba. We optimized
the benchmark program for a \Intel \XeonPhi (Knights Corner, KNC) system named
&quot;COMA (PACS-IX)&quot; at CCS Tsukuba under the Intel Parallel Computing Center
program. A single precision BiCGStab solver with the overlapped Restricted
Additive Schwarz (RAS) preconditioner was implemented using SIMD intrinsics,
OpenMP and MPI in the offload mode. With the reverse-offloading technique, we
could reduce the communication and offloading overheads. We observed a
performance of $\sim 200$ GFlops sustained for the Wilson-Clover hopping matrix
multiplication on the lattice sizes larger than $24^3\times 32$ on a sinlge
card of the COMA system. A good weak scaling perofmace was observed on the
local lattice sizes larger than $24^3\times 32$.

n\to \eta n$ channel can be explained through a peculiar radial behaviour of
the $p$-wave quark states with $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$ in the low lying S11
resonances and the opening of the $K\Sigma$ threshold rather than by an exotic
resonance. We explain the mechanism of its formation in the framework of a
coupled channel formalism which incorporates quasi-bound quark-model states
corresponding to the two low lying resonances in the S11 partial wave. A
relation to the Single Quark Transition Model is pointed out.

roughly half of the data, were found mostly characterized by the MPs' home
constituencies and only to a limited extent by the MPs' party affiliations. In
comparison to previous findings regarding certain presidential systems, MPs
committee assignments or gender were found irrelevant.

collisions at LHC energies. In such collisions a deconfined state of nuclear
matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is formed. Due to their early production,
quarkonium states are good probes to study the QGP evolution. Such states are
affected by suppression mechanisms which lead to reduced yields with respect to
pp and p-Pb collisions, while regeneration phenomena might lead to an
enhancement of their production. The latter effects are expected to be
negligible at LHC for bottomonium states. The recent ALICE results on
$\Upsilon$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm
NN}}=5.02\;\rm{T}e\rm{V}$ will be presented and compared with previous
measurements at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76\;\rm{T}e\rm{V}$. A comparison with
theoretical calculations will be performed as well. Results obtained in p-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02\;\rm{T}e\rm{V}$ will also be discussed.

congruences on the Minkowski space-time possess intrinsic self-dual, restricted
gauge and algebraic structures. The complex eikonal, Weyl 2-spinor,
$SL(2,\mathbb C)$ Yang-Mills and complex Maxwell fields, the latter produced by
integer-valued electric charges (&quot;elementary&quot; for the Kerr-like congruences),
can all be explicitly associated with any shear-free null geodesic congruence.
Using twistor variables, we derive the general solution of the equations of the
shear-free null geodesic congruence (as a modification of the Kerr theorem) and
analyze the corresponding &quot;particle-like&quot; field distributions, with bounded
singularities of the associated physical fields. These can be obtained in a
straightforward algebraic way and exhibit non-trivial collective dynamics
simulating physical interactions

thousands of deaths. The analysis of death tolls helps to understand the
dynamics of the conflict and to better allocate resources to the affected
areas. In this article, we use information on the daily number of deaths to
study temporal and spatial correlations in the data, and exploit this
information to forecast events of deaths. We find that the number of deaths per
day follows a log-normal distribution during the conflict. We have also
identified strong correlations between cities and on consecutive days, implying
that major deaths in one location are typically followed by major deaths in
both the same location and in other areas. We find that war-related deaths are
not random events and observing death tolls in some cities helps to better
predict these numbers across the system.

in superconductivity of metals was developed on the basis of four idealized
assumptions: (1) only a small number of electrons are involved in
superconductivity; (2) magnetic interactions between electron spins lead to
superconductivity; (3) there are different electronic states, i.e.,
doubly-occupied, singly-occupied (spin up or down) and empty states; (4) the
average kinetic energy of electrons complies with the equipartition theorem of
energy. A formula to estimate T_C was thus derived. It was found that, T_C is
not only related to the electron density and the critical magnetic field, but
also to the degrees of freedom of electrons. The T_C values calculated from
this formula are in good agreement with the experimental results for most
metals. According to this theory, T_C generally increases with decreasing
dimension of metals. For example, T_C in the 3-dimensional (3D) Al metal is
1.19K, but increases to 1.46K in 2D and 2.06K in 1D.

  arXiv:1612.07079</comments><license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license><abstract>  In this paper, a microscopic theory of magnetic-interaction-induced pairing
in superconductivity of high temperature superconductors (HTSC) was developed
on the basis of four idealized assumptions: (1) only a small number of
electrons(or holes) are involved in superconductivity, and its density is
n{\delta}^2; (2) magnetic interactions between electron spins lead to
superconductivity; (3) there are different electronic states, i.e., the on-site
doubly-occupied electrons forming anti-ferromagnetic insulator states, the
off-site doubly-occupied electrons forming superconducting states, the
singly-occupied (spin up or down) electrons forming normal states and the empty
states; (4) the average kinetic energy of electrons (or holes) complies with
the equipartition theorem of energy. Based on these assumptions, an approximate
effective Hamiltonian was suggested. A parabolic relation between T_C and the
doping concentration {\delta} was found and thus the phase diagram for HTSC has
been explained. It was also found that, T_C is related to the
anti-ferromagnetic interaction energy J (or critical magnetic field B_C) and
the degrees of freedom of electrons i. The T_C values are thus calculated from
this theory to be 92.8K for YBa2Cu3O6.15, 40.3K for La2CuO4, and 58K for
SmOFeAs, which are in good agreement with the experimental results of 92K, 40K,
and 54K, respectively. It was estimated that, T_C in the slab HTSC is higher
than that in the bulk, and T_C for SmOFeAs can be up to 116K.
