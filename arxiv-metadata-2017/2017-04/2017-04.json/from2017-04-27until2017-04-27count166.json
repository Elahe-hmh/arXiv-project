For low frequencies (< 1\nGHz), digital techniques can be used to coherently measure the instantaneous,\nlocal field vectors and to manipulate them in software. This opens up for new\ntypes of experiments that go beyond those currently possible to perform in\noptics, for information-rich radio physics applications such as radio\nastronomy, and for novel wireless communication concepts.\n", "  In this paper we study, both analytically and numerically, questions\ninvolving the distribution of eigenvalues of Maass forms on the moonshine\ngroups $\\Gamma_0(N)^+$, where $N>1$ is a square-free integer. After we prove\nthat $\\Gamma_0(N)^+$ has one cusp, we compute the constant term of the\nassociated non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. We then derive an \"average\"\nWeyl's law for the distribution of eigenvalues of Maass forms, from which we\nprove the \"classical\" Weyl's law as a special case. The groups corresponding to\n$N=5$ and $N=6$ have the same signature; however, our analysis shows that,\nasymptotically, there are infinitely more cusp forms for $\\Gamma_0(5)^+$ than\nfor $\\Gamma_0(6)^+$. We view this result as being consistent with the\nPhillips-Sarnak philosophy since we have shown, unconditionally, the existence\nof two groups which have different Weyl's laws. In addition, we employ Hejhal's\nalgorithm, together with recently developed refinements from [31], and\nnumerically determine the first $3557$ of $\\Gamma_0(5)^+$ and the first $12474$\neigenvalues of $\\Gamma_0(6)^+$. With this information, we empirically verify\nsome conjectured distributional properties of the eigenvalues.\n", "  It is well-known that there are four distinct basic types (two BigBang types,\nLemaitre and BigCrunch type) for solutions of the general Friedmann equation\nwith positive cosmological constant, where radiation and matter do not couple.\nIn the note it is shown that the \"frontier lines\" between BigBang/BigCrunch and\nBigBang/Lemaitre are given by two smooth function branches, expressing the\ncosmological constant as unique functions of the matter and radiation density,\nwhich satisfy a simple asymptotic relation w.r.t. the matter density. The proof\nis based on the solution of the equation $\\sigma=\\sigma_{cr}$, where $\\sigma$\nis the radiation invariant of the Friedmann equation and $\\sigma_{cr}$ the\n\"critical radiation parameter\" (see [3]).\n", "  We extend the Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gor'kov (GLAG) theory to account for\nthe variation of the upper critical field Hc2 with Sn content in A15-type\nNb3Sn. Hc2 at the vicinity of the critical temperature Tc is related\nquantitatively to the electrical resistivity, specific heat capacity\ncoefficient and Tc, with inclusion of the electron-phonon coupling correction,\nPauli paramagnetic limiting and martensitic phase transformation of A15\nlattices. Hc2 near Tc is then extrapolated to Hc2(0) at temperature 0K, and\nHc2(0) versus tin content agrees well with experiments. We find that, as Sn\ncontent gradually approaches the stoichiometry, Nb3Sn undergoes a transition\nfrom the dirty limit to clean limit, split by the phase transformation\nboundary. The H-T phase boundary and the pinning force show different behaviors\nin the cubic and tetragonal phase. Applying the theoretical formulas in the\ntechnical Nb3Sn wire, we obtain the dependence of the composition gradient on\nthe superconducting properties variation in the A15 layer, as well as the\ncurved tail at vicinity of Hc2 in the Kramer plot of the Nb3Sn wire. This gives\na better understanding of the inhomogeneous-composition inducing discrepancy\nbetween the results by the state-of-art scaling laws and experiments.\n", "  High-resolution simulations of supermassive black holes in isolated galaxies\nhave suggested the importance of short (~10 Myr) episodes of rapid accretion\ncaused by interactions between the black hole and massive dense clouds within\nthe host. Accretion of such clouds could potentially provide the dominant\nsource for black hole growth in high-z galaxies, but it remains unresolved in\ncosmological simulations. Using a stochastic subgrid model calibrated by\nhigh-resolution isolated galaxy simulations, we investigate the impact that\nvariability in black hole accretion rates has on black hole growth and the\nevolution of the host galaxy. We find this clumpy accretion to more efficiently\nfuel high-redshift black hole growth. This increased mass allows for more rapid\naccretion even in the absence of high-density clumps, compounding the effect\nand resulting in substantially faster overall black hole growth. This increased\ngrowth allows the black hole to efficiently evacuate gas from the central\nregion of the galaxy, driving strong winds up to ~2500 km/s, producing outflows\n~10x stronger than the smooth accretion case, suppressing the inflow of gas\nonto the host galaxy, and suppressing the star formation within the galaxy by\nas much as a factor of two. This suggests that the proper incorporation of\nvariability is a key factor in the co-evolution between black holes and their\nhosts.\n", "  In the theory of the two-dimensional Ising model, the diagonal susceptibility\nis equal to a sum involving Toeplitz determinants. In terms of a parameter k\nthe diagonal susceptibility is analytic inside the unit circle, and the authors\nproved the conjecture that this function has the unit circle as a natural\nboundary. The symbol of the Toepltiz determinants was a k-deformation of one\nwith a single singularity on the unit circle. Here we extend the result, first,\nto deformations of a larger class of symbols with a single singularity on the\nunit circle, and then to deformations of (almost) general Fisher-Hartwig\nsymbols.\n", "  The recently discovered 5 MeV bump highlights that the uncertainty in the\nreactor neutrino spectrum is far greater than some theoretical estimates.\nMedium baseline reactor neutrino experiments will deliver by far the most\nprecise ever measurements of theta12. However, as a result of the bump, such a\ndetermination of theta12 using the theoretical spectrum would yield a value of\nsin^2(2theta12) which is more than 1% higher than the true value. We show that\nby using recent measurements of the reactor neutrino spectrum the precision of\na measurement of theta12 at a medium baseline reactor neutrino experiment can\nbe improved appreciably. We estimate this precision as a function of the 9Li\nspallation background veto efficiency and dead time.\n", "  In this article we consider the conformal decomposition of the Einstein\nconstraint equations introduced by Lichnerowicz, Choquet-Bruhat, and York, on\nasymptotically flat (AF) manifolds. Using the non-CMC fixed-point framework\ndeveloped in 2009 by Holst, Nagy, and Tsogtgerel and by Maxwell, we establish\nexistence of coupled non-CMC weak solutions for AF manifolds. As is the case\nfor the analogous existence results for non-CMC solutions on closed manifolds\nand compact manifolds with boundary, our results here avoid the near-CMC\nassumption by assuming that the freely specifiable part of the data given by\nthe traceless-transverse part of the rescaled extrinsic curvature and the\nmatter fields are sufficiently small. The non-CMC rough solutions results here\nfor AF manifolds may be viewed as extending to AF manifolds the 2009 and 2014\nresults on rough far-from-CMC positive Yamabe solutions for closed and compact\nmanifolds with boundary. Similarly, our results may be viewed as extending the\nrecent 2014 results for AF manifolds of Dilts, Isenberg, Mazzeo and Meier, and\nof Holst and Meier; while their results are restricted to smoother background\nmetrics and data, the results here allow the regularity to be extended down to\nthe minimum regularity allowed by the background metric and the matter, further\ncompleting the rough solution program initiated by Maxwell and Choquet-Bruhat\nin 2004.\n", "  Combining neutrino oscillations at T2K or T2HK with antineutrinos\noscillations from muon decay at rest (DAR) allows a determination of the\nleptonic CP-violating phase delta. The degeneracies of this phase with theta13\nand theta23 are broken and delta can be reliably distinguished from 180-delta.\nWe present the sensitivity to delta of T2(H)K together with a muon DAR\nexperiment using Super-K as a near detector and Hyper-K at the Tochibora site\nas a far detector.\n", "  Ultrathin $\\rm Bi_2Se_3$-NbN bilayers comprise a simple proximity system of a\ntopological insulator and an s-wave superconductor for studying gating effects\non topological superconductors. Here we report on 3 nm thick NbN layers of\nweakly connected superconducting islands, overlayed with 10 nm thick $\\rm\nBi_2Se_3$ film which facilitates enhanced proximity coupling between them.\nResistance versus temperature of the most resistive bilayers shows insulating\nbehavior but with signs of superconductivity. We measured the magnetoresistance\n(MR) of these bilayers versus temperature with and without a magnetic field H\nnormal to the wafer (MR=[R(H)-R(0)]/\\{[R(H)+R(0)]/2\\}), and under three\nelectric gate-fields of 0 and $\\pm2$ MV/cm. The MR results showed a complex set\nof gate sensitive peaks which extended up to about 30 K. The results are\ndiscussed in terms of vortex physics, and the origin of the different MR peaks\nis identified and attributed to flux-flow MR in the isolated NbN islands and\nthe different proximity regions in the $\\rm Bi_2Se_3$ cap-layer. The dominant\nMR peak was found to be consistent with enhanced proximity induced\nsuperconductivity in the topological edge currents regions. The high\ntemperature MR data suggest a possible pseudogap phase or a highly extended\nfluctuation regime.\n", "  We report theoretical evidence that bulk nonlinear materials weakly\ninteracting with highly localized plasmonic modes in ultra-sub-wavelength\nmetallic nanostructures can lead to nonlinear effects at the single plasmon\nlevel in the visible range. In particular, the two-plasmon interaction energy\nin such systems is numerically estimated to be comparable with the typical\nplasmon linewidths. Localized surface plasmons are thus predicted to exhibit a\npurely nonclassical behavior, which can be clearly identified by a\nsub-Poissonian second-order correlation in the signal scattered from the\nquantized plasmonic field under coherent electromagnetic excitation. We\nexplicitly show that systems sensitive to single-plasmon scattering can be\nexperimentally realized by combining electromagnetic confinement in the\ninterstitial region of gold nanodimers with local infiltration or deposition of\nordinary nonlinear materials. We also propose configurations that could allow\nto realistically detect such an effect with state-of-the-art technology,\novercoming the limitations imposed by the short plasmonic lifetime.\n", "  Accelerator driven system (ADS) subcritical nuclear reactors are under\ndevelopment around the world. They will be intense sources of free, 30-50 MeV\nantimuon decay at rest antimuon neutrinos. These ADS reactor neutrinos can\nprovide a robust test of the LSND anomaly and a precise measurement of the\nleptonic CP-violating phase delta, including sign(cos(delta)). The first phase\nof many ADS programs includes the construction of a low energy, high intensity\nproton or deuteron accelerator, which can yield competitive bounds on sterile\nneutrinos.\n", "  Geometric and dynamical aspects of a coupled 4D-2D interacting quantum field\ntheory - the gauged nonAbelian vortex - are investigated. The fluctuations of\nthe internal 2D nonAbelian vortex zeromodes excite the massless 4D Yang-Mills\nmodes and in general give rise to divergent energies. This means that the\nwell-known 2D CP(N-1) zeromodes associated with a nonAbelian vortex become\nnonnormalizable. Moreover, all sorts of global, topological 4D effects such as\nthe nonAbelian Aharonov-Bohm effect come into play. These topological global\nfeatures and the dynamical properties associated with the fluctuation of the 2D\nvortex moduli modes are intimately correlated, as shown concretely here in a\nU(1) x SU(N) x SU(N) model with scalar fields in a bifundamental representation\nof the two SU(N) factor gauge groups.\n", "  Many organisms capitalize on their ability to predict the environment to\nmaximize available free energy, and reinvest this energy to create new complex\nstructures. This functionality relies on the manipulation of patterns -\ntemporally ordered sequences of data. Here, we propose a framework to describe\npattern manipulators -- devices that convert thermodynamic work to patterns or\nvice versa - and use them to build a 'pattern engine' that facilitates a\nthermodynamic cycle of pattern creation and consumption. We show that the least\nheat dissipation is achieved by the provably simplest devices; the ones that\nexhibit desired operational behaviour while maintaining the least internal\nmemory. We derive the ultimate limits of this heat dissipation, and show that\nit is generally non-zero and connected with the pattern's intrinsic crypticity\n- a complexity theoretic quantity that captures the puzzling difference between\nthe amount of information the pattern's past behaviour reveals about its\nfuture, and the amount one needs to communicate about this past to optimally\npredict the future.\n", "  Ratios of line of sight baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peaks at two\nredshifts only depend upon the average dark energy equation of states between\nthose redshifts, as the dependence on anchors such as the BAO scale or the\nHubble constant is canceled in a ratio. As a result, BAO ratios provide a probe\nof dark energy which is independent of both the cosmic distance ladder and the\nearly evolution of universe. In this note, we use ratios to demonstrate that\nthe known tension between the Lyman alpha forest BAO measurement and other\nprobes arises entirely from recent (0.57<z<2.34) cosmological expansion. Using\nratios of the line of sight Lyman alpha forest and BOSS CMASS BAO scales, we\nshow that there is already more than 3 sigma tension with the standard\nLambdaCDM cosmological model which implies that either (i) The BOSS Lyman alpha\nforest measurement of the Hubble parameter was too low as a result of a\nstatistical fluctuation or systematic error or else (ii) the dark energy\nequation of state falls steeply at high redshift.\n", "  Quantum communications promises reliable transmission of quantum information,\nefficient distribution of entanglement and generation of completely secure\nkeys. For all these tasks, we need to determine the optimal point-to-point\nrates that are achievable by two remote parties at the ends of a quantum\nchannel, without restrictions on their local operations and classical\ncommunication, which can be unlimited and two-way. These two-way assisted\ncapacities represent the ultimate rates that are reachable without quantum\nrepeaters. By constructing an upperbound based on the relative entropy of\nentanglement and devising a dimension-independent technique dubbed\n\"teleportation stretching\", we establish these capacities for many fundamental\nchannels, namely bosonic lossy channels, quantum-limited amplifiers, dephasing\nand erasure channels in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine the\nfundamental rate-loss trade-off affecting any protocol of quantum key\ndistribution. Our findings set the ultimate limits of point-to-point quantum\ncommunications and provide the most precise and general benchmarks for quantum\nrepeaters.\n", "  It is well-known that there are four distinct basic types (two Big Bang\ntypes, Lemaitre and Big Crunch type) for solutions of the general Friedmann\nequation with positive cosmological constant, where radiation and matter do not\ncouple (see e.g. [2, p.7]. In that paper the system of case distinction\nparameters contains a \"critical radiation parameter\" $\\sigma_{cr}$. The present\nnote contains the constructive description of the so-called {\\em border lines}\nbetween Big Bang/Big Crunch type and Big Bang/Lemaitre type for so-called\nHubble solutions of the Friedmann equation by two smooth function branches,\nexpressing the cosmological constant as unique functions of the matter and\nradiation density (which is considered as a parameter). These functions satisfy\nsimple asymptotic relations w.r.t. the matter density. They are constructed as\nthe solutions of the equation $\\sigma=\\sigma_{cr}.\n", "  The weakly interacting helical Luttinger liquid, due to spin momentum\nlocking, is characterized by extremely peculiar local observables: we show that\nthe density-density correlation functions do not exhibit signatures of Friedel\nand Wigner oscillations, and that spin-spin correlation functions, which are\nstrongly anisotropic, witness the formation of a planar spin wave. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the most relevant scattering potentials involving a localized\nimpurity are not able to modify the electron density, while only magnetic\nimpurities can pin the planar spin density wave.\n", "  With an expected energy of 7.6(5) eV, $^{229}$Th possesses the lowest excited\nnuclear state in the landscape of all presently known nuclei. The energy\ncorresponds to a wavelength of about 160 nm and would conceptually allow for an\noptical laser excitation of a nuclear transition. We report on a VUV optical\ndetection system that was designed for the direct detection of the isomeric\nground-state transition of $^{229}$Th. $^{229(m)}$Th ions originating from a\n$^{233}$U $\\alpha$-recoil source are collected on a micro electrode that is\nplaced in the focus of an annular parabolic mirror. The latter is used to\nparallelize the UV fluorescence that may emerge from the isomeric ground-state\ntransition of $^{229}$Th. The parallelized light is then focused by a second\nannular parabolic mirror onto a CsI-coated position-sensitive MCP detector\nbehind the mirror exit. To achieve a high signal-to-background ratio, a small\nspot size on the MCP detector needs to be achieved. Besides extensive\nray-tracing simulations of the optical setup, we present a procedure for its\nalignment, as well as test measurements using a D$_2$ lamp, where a focal-spot\nsize of $\\approx$100 $\\mu$m has been achieved. Assuming a purely photonic\ndecay, a signal-to-background ratio of $\\approx$7000:1 could be achieved.\n", "  Statistical inference problems arising within signal processing, data mining,\nand machine learning naturally give rise to hard combinatorial optimization\nproblems. These problems become intractable when the dimensionality of the data\nis large, as is often the case for modern datasets. A popular idea is to\nconstruct convex relaxations of these combinatorial problems, which can be\nsolved efficiently for large scale datasets.\n  Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are among the most powerful\nmethods in this family, and are surprisingly well-suited for a broad range of\nproblems where data take the form of matrices or graphs. It has been observed\nseveral times that, when the `statistical noise' is small enough, SDP\nrelaxations correctly detect the underlying combinatorial structures.\n  In this paper we develop asymptotic predictions for several `detection\nthresholds,' as well as for the estimation error above these thresholds. We\nstudy some classical SDP relaxations for statistical problems motivated by\ngraph synchronization and community detection in networks. We map these\noptimization problems to statistical mechanics models with vector spins, and\nuse non-rigorous techniques from statistical mechanics to characterize the\ncorresponding phase transitions. Our results clarify the effectiveness of SDP\nrelaxations in solving high-dimensional statistical problems.\n", "  We provide a purely variational proof of the existence of eigenvalues below\nthe bottom of the essential spectrum for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with an\nattractive $\\delta$-potential supported by a star graph, i.e. by a finite union\nof rays emanating from the same point. In contrast to the previous works, the\nconstruction is valid without any additional assumption on the number or the\nrelative position of the rays. The approach is used to obtain an upper bound\nfor the lowest eigenvalue.\n", "  Superconductivity in granular films is controlled by the grain size and the\ninter-grain coupling. In a two-component granular system formed by a random\nmixture of a normal metal (N) and a superconductor (S), the superconducting\nnano-grains may become coupled through S-N weak links, thereby affecting the\nsuperconducting properties of the network. We report on the study of\nsuperconductivity in immiscible Nb-Cu nanocomposite films with varying\ncompositions. The microstructure of the films revealed the presence of phase\nseparated, closely spaced, nano-grains of Nb and Cu whose sizes changed\nmarginally with composition. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc0)\nof the films decreased with increasing concentration of Cu with a concomitant\ndecrease in the upper critical field (Hc2) and the critical current (Ic). Our\nresults indicate the presence of superconducting phase fluctuations in all\nfilms with varying Nb:Cu content which not only affected the temperature for\nthe formation of a true phase coherent superconducting condensate in the films\nbut also other superconducting properties.\n", "  Complex information-processing systems, for example quantum circuits,\ncryptographic protocols, or multi-player games, are naturally described as\nnetworks composed of more basic information-processing systems. A modular\nanalysis of such systems requires a mathematical model of systems that is\nclosed under composition, i.e., a network of these objects is again an object\nof the same type. We propose such a model and call the corresponding systems\ncausal boxes.\n  Causal boxes capture superpositions of causal structures, e.g., messages sent\nby a causal box A can be in a superposition of different orders or in a\nsuperposition of being sent to box B and box C. Furthermore, causal boxes can\nmodel systems whose behavior depends on time. By instantiating the Abstract\nCryptography framework with causal boxes, we obtain the first composable\nsecurity framework that can handle arbitrary quantum protocols and relativistic\nprotocols.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of interacting many-body systems has become a unique\nvenue for the realization of novel states of matter. Here we unveil a new class\nof nonequilibrium states that are eigenstates of an emergent local Hamiltonian.\nThe latter is explicitly time dependent and, even though it does not commute\nwith the physical Hamiltonian, it behaves as a conserved quantity of the\ntime-evolving system. We discuss two examples in which the emergent eigenstate\nsolution can be applied for an extensive (in system size) time: transport in\none-dimensional lattices with initial particle (or spin) imbalance, and sudden\nexpansion of quantum gases in optical lattices. We focus on noninteracting\nspinless fermions, hard-core bosons, and the Heisenberg model. We show that\ncurrent-carrying states can be ground states of emergent local Hamiltonians,\nand that they can exhibit a quasimomentum distribution function that is peaked\nat nonzero (and tunable) quasimomentum. We also show that time-evolving states\ncan be highly-excited eigenstates of emergent local Hamiltonians, with an\nentanglement entropy that does not exhibit volume-law scaling.\n", "  The quantum speed limit (QSL) time for open system characterizes the most\nefficient response of the system to the environmental influences. Previous\nresults showed that the non-Markovianity governs the quantum speedup. Via\nstudying the dynamics of a dissipative two-level system, we reveal that the\nnon-Markovian effect is only the dynamical way of the quantum speedup, while\nthe formation of the system-environment bound states is the essential reason\nfor the quantum speedup. Our attribution of the quantum speedup to the\nenergy-spectrum character can supply another vital path for experiments when\nthe quantum speedup shows up without any dynamical calculations. The potential\nexperimental observation of our quantum speedup mechanism in the circuit QED\nsystem is discussed. Our results may be of both theoretical and experimental\ninterests in exploring the ultimate QSL in realistic environments, and may open\nnew perspectives for devising active quantum speedup devices.\n", "  We propose and develop a new procedure, whereby a quantum system can learn to\nanneal to a desired ground state. We demonstrate successful learning to produce\nan entangled state for a two-qubit system, then demonstrate generalizability to\nlarger systems. The amount of additional learning necessary decreases as the\nsize of the system increases. Because current technologies limit measurement of\nthe states of quantum annealing machines to determination of the average spin\nat each site, we then construct a \"broken pathway\" between the initial and\ndesired states, at each step of which the average spins are nonzero, and show\nsuccessful learning of that pathway. Using this technique we show we can direct\nannealing to multiqubit GHZ and W states, and verify that we have done so.\nBecause quantum neural networks are robust to noise and decoherence we expect\nour method to be readily implemented experimentally; we show some preliminary\nresults which support this.\n", "  We show that the partition function on a generalised conifold $C_{m,n}$ with\n${m+n \\choose m}$ crepant resolutions can be equivalently computed on the\ncompound du Val singularity $A_{m+n-1}\\times \\mathbb C$ with a unique crepant\nresolution.\n", "  Crucial developments in neutrino physics would be the determination of the\nmass hierarchy (MH) and measurement of the CP phase in the leptonic sector. The\npatterns of the transition probabilities $P(\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_\\tau)$ and\n$P(\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_\\tau)$ are sensitive to these\noscillation parameters. An asymmetry parameter can be defined as the difference\nof these two probabilities normalized to their sum. The profile of the\nasymmetry parameter gives a clear signal of the mass ordering as it is found to\nbe positive for inverted hierarchy and negative for normal hierarchy. The\nasymmetry parameter is also sensitive to the CP phase. We consider the effects\nof non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) on the determination of the mass\nhierarchy. Since we assume the largest new physics effects involve the $\\tau$\nsector only, we ignore NSI in production and study the NSI effects in detection\nas well as along propagation. We find that the NSI effects can significantly\nmodify the prediction of the asymmetry parameter though the MH can still be\nresolved.\n", "  A non-Ohmic current that grows exponentially with the square root of applied\nelectric field is well known from thermionic field emission (the Schottky\neffect), electrolytes (the second Wien effect) and semiconductors (the\nPoole-Frenkel effect). It is a universal signature of the attractive Coulomb\nforce between positive and negative electrical charges, which is revealed as\nthe charges are driven in opposite directions by the force of an applied\nelectric field. Here we apply thermal quenches to spin ice to prepare\nmetastable populations of bound pairs of positive and negative emergent\nmagnetic monopoles at millikelvin temperatures. We find that the application of\na magnetic field results in a universal exponential-root field growth of\nmagnetic current, thus confirming the microscopic Coulomb force between the\nmagnetic monopole quasiparticles and establishing a magnetic analogue of the\nPoole-Frenkel effect. At temperatures above 300 mK, gradual restoration of\nkinetic monopole equilibria causes the non-Ohmic current to smoothly evolve\ninto the high field Wien effect for magnetic monopoles, as confirmed by\ncomparison to a recent and rigorous theory of the Wien effect in spin ice. Our\nresults extend the universality of the exponential-root field form into\nmagnetism and illustrate the power of emergent particle kinetics to describe\nfar-from equilibrium response in complex systems.\n", "  We study the preparation of topologically ordered states by interpolating\nbetween an initial Hamiltonian with a unique product ground state and a\nHamiltonian with a topologically degenerate ground state space. By simulating\nthe dynamics for small systems, we numerically observe a certain stability of\nthe prepared state as a function of the initial Hamiltonian. For small systems\nor long interpolation times, we argue that the resulting state can be\nidentified by computing suitable effective Hamiltonians. For effective anyon\nmodels, this analysis singles out the relevant physical processes and extends\nthe study of the splitting of the topological degeneracy by Bonderson. We\nillustrate our findings using Kitaev's Majorana chain, effective anyon chains,\nthe toric code and Levin-Wen string-net models.\n", "  We consider non-abelian kinetic mixing between the Standard Model SU(2$)_L$\nand a dark sector U(1$)^\\prime$ gauge group associated with the presence of a\nscalar SU(2$)_L$ triplet. The magnitude of the resulting dark photon coupling\n$\\epsilon$ is determined by the ratio of the triplet vacuum expectation value,\nconstrained to by $\\lsim 4$ GeV by electroweak precision tests, to the scale\n$\\Lambda$ of the effective theory. The corresponding effective operator Wilson\ncoefficient can be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ while accommodating null results for dark\nphoton searches, allowing for a distinctive LHC dark photon phenomenology.\nAfter outlining the possible LHC signatures, we illustrate by recasting current\nATLAS dark photon results into the non-abelian mixing context.\n", "  The Sasaki-Nakamura transformation gives a short-ranged potential and a\nconvergent source term for the master equation of perturbations in the Kerr\nspace-time. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the\ntransformation, and present a new relaxed necessary and sufficient condition of\nthe transformation to obtain the short-ranged potential in the assumption that\nthe transformation converges in the far distance. Also, we discuss quasinormal\nmode frequencies which are determined by the information around the peak of the\npotential in the WKB analysis. Finally, in the extreme Kerr limit, $a/M \\to 1$,\nwhere $M$ and $a$ denote the mass and spin parameter of a Kerr black hole,\nrespectively, we find the peak location of the potential, $r_p/M \\lesssim 1 +\n1.8 \\,(1-a/M)^{1/2}$ by using the new transformation. The uncertainty of the\nlocation is as large as that expected from the equivalence principle.\n", "  Using only Ia supernova (SN) observations, it is not possible to distinguish\nthe evolution of the SN absolute magnitude $M_B$ from an arbitrary evolution of\nthe Hubble parameter H(z). However, using Etherington's distance-duality\nrelation, which relates the angular and luminosity distances, together with the\nobserved angular baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale at any redshift z, one\nmay calibrate an effective M(z). This calibration involves a scale which\ndepends on the cosmological model, however the evolution of the effective M(z)\nbetween two redshifts with BAO observations is independent of this scale. The\nline of sight BAO scale can be used to extend this calibration to redshifts\nnear z. As an application, using BOSS BAO at z=0.32 and 2.34, JLA supernova at\nlow $z$ and Hubble Space Telescope SN at z>1.7, we find a statistically\ninsignificant downward shift M(2.34)-M(0.32)=-0.08$\\pm$0.15. Replacing BOSS\ndata with the best fit Planck LCDM BAO expectations, we find a shift of\n-0.24$\\pm$0.13. With the SN that will be observed by the James Webb Space\nTelescope, such a calibration at z=2.34 will be more precise, and it will serve\nas an anchor for cosmological analyses with the SN that it will observe at yet\nhigher z.\n", "  A key research question at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the test of\nmodels of new physics. Testing if a particular parameter set of such a model is\nexcluded by LHC data is a challenge: It requires the time consuming generation\nof scattering events, the simulation of the detector response, the event\nreconstruction, cross section calculations and analysis code to test against\nseveral hundred signal regions defined by the ATLAS and CMS experiment. In the\nBSM-AI project we attack this challenge with a new approach. Machine learning\ntools are thought to predict within a fraction of a millisecond if a model is\nexcluded or not directly from the model parameters. A first example is SUSY-AI,\ntrained on the phenomenological supersymmetric standard model (pMSSM). About\n300,000 pMSSM model sets - each tested with 200 signal regions by ATLAS - have\nbeen used to train and validate SUSY-AI. The code is currently able to\nreproduce the ATLAS exclusion regions in 19 dimensions with an accuracy of at\nleast 93 percent. It has been validated further within the constrained MSSM and\na minimal natural supersymmetric model, again showing high accuracy. SUSY-AI\nand its future BSM derivatives will help to solve the problem of recasting LHC\nresults for any model of new physics.\n  SUSY-AI can be downloaded at http://susyai.hepforge.org/. An on-line\ninterface to the program for quick testing purposes can be found at\nhttp://www.susy-ai.org/.\n", "  We consider a very general stochastic model for an SIR epidemic on a network\nwhich allows an individual's infectious period, and the time it takes to\ncontact each of its neighbours after becoming infected, to be correlated. We\nwrite down the message passing system of equations for this model and prove,\nfor the first time, that it has a unique feasible solution. We also generalise\nan earlier result by proving that this solution provides a rigorous upper bound\nfor the expected epidemic size (cumulative number of infection events) at any\nfixed time $t>0$.\n  We specialise these results to a homogeneous special case where the graph\n(network) is symmetric. The message passing system here reduces to just four\nequations. We prove that cycles in the network inhibit the spread of infection,\nand derive important epidemiological results concerning the final epidemic size\nand threshold behaviour for a major outbreak. For Poisson contact processes,\nthis message passing system is equivalent to a non-Markovian pair approximation\nmodel, which we show has well-known pairwise models as special cases.\n  We show further that a sequence of message passing systems, starting with the\nhomogeneous one just described, converges to the deterministic\nKermack-McKendrick equations for this stochastic model. For Poisson contact and\nrecovery, we show that this convergence is monotone, from which it follows that\nthe message passing system (and hence also the pairwise model) here provides a\nbetter approximation to the expected epidemic size at time $t>0$ than the\nKermack-McKendrick model.\n", "  The system of spinless fermions on a hexagonal lattice is studied . We have\nconsidered tight-binding model with the hopping integrals between the\nnearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor lattice sites, that depend on the\ndirection of the link. The links are divided on three types depending on the\ndirection, the hopping integrals are defined by different phases along the\nlinks. The energy of the system depends on the phase differences, the solutions\nfor the phases, that correspond to the minimums of the energy, lead to a\ntopological insulator state with the nontrivial Chern numbers. We have analyzed\ndistinct topological states and phase transitions, the behavior of the chiral\ngapless edge modes, have defined the Chern numbers. The band structure of\ntopological insulator (TI) is calculated, the ground-state phase diagram in the\nparameter space is obtained. We propose a novel mechanism of realization of TI,\nwhen the TI state is result of spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry\ndue to nontrivial stable solutions for the phases that determine the hopping\nintegrals along the links and show that the Haldane model can be implemented in\nreal compounds of the condensed matter physics.\n", "  We study the dependence of the fidelity of the surface code in the presence\nof a single finite-temperature massless bosonic environment after a quantum\nerror correction cycle. The three standard types of environment are considered:\nsuper-Ohmic, Ohmic, and sub-Ohmic. Our results show that, for regimes relevant\nto current experiments, quantum error correction works well even in the\npresence of environment-induced, long-range inter-qubit interactions. A\nthreshold always exists at finite temperatures, although its temperature\ndependence is very sensitive to the type of environment. For the super-Ohmic\ncase, the critical coupling constant separating high- from low-fidelity\ndecreases with increasing temperature. For both Ohmic and super-Ohmic cases,\nthe dependence of the critical coupling on temperature is weak. In all cases,\nthe critical coupling is determined by microscopic parameters of the\nenvironment. For the sub-Ohmic case, it also depends strongly on the duration\nof the QEC cycle.\n", "  Histograms with weighted entries are used to estimate probability density\nfunctions. Computer simulation is the main application of this type of\nhistograms. A review on chi-square tests for comparing weighted histograms is\npresented in this paper. Improvements to these tests that have a size closer to\nits nominal value are proposed. Numerical examples are presented for evaluation\nand demonstration of various applications of the tests.\n", "  We report the discovery of Qatar-3b, Qatar-4b, and Qatar-5b, three new\ntransiting planets identified by the Qatar Exoplanet Survey (QES). The three\nplanets belong to the hot Jupiter family, with orbital periods of\n$P_{Q3b}$=2.50792 days, $P_{Q4b}$=1.80539 days, and $P_{Q5b}$=2.87923 days.\nFollow-up spectroscopic observations reveal the masses of the planets to be\n$M_{Q3b}$=4.31$\\pm0.47$ $M_{\\rm J}$, $M_{Q4b}$=6.10$ \\pm0.54$ $M_{\\rm J}$, and\n$M_{Q5b}$ = 4.32$ \\pm0.18$ $M_{\\rm J}$, while model fits to the transit light\ncurves yield radii of $R_{Q3b}$ = 1.096$ \\pm0.14$ $R_{\\rm J}$, $R_{Q4b}$ =\n1.135$ \\pm0.11$ $R_{\\rm J}$, and $R_{Q5b}$ = 1.107$ \\pm0.064$ $R_{\\rm J}$. The\nhost stars are low-mass main sequence stars with masses and radii $M_{Q3}$ =\n1.145$ \\pm0.064$ $M_{\\odot}$, $M_{Q4}$ = 0.896$ \\pm0.048$ $M_{\\odot}$, $M_{Q5}$\n= 1.128$ \\pm0.056$ $M_{\\odot}$ and $R_{Q3}$ = 1.272$ \\pm0.14$ $R_{\\odot}$,\n$R_{Q4}$ = 0.849$\\pm0.063$ $R_{\\odot}$ and $R_{Q5}$ = 1.076$\\pm0.051$\n$R_{\\odot}$ for Qatar-3, 4 and 5 respectively. The V magnitudes of the three\nhost stars are $V_{Q3}$=12.88, $V_{Q4}$=13.60, and $V_{Q5}$=12.82. All three\nnew planets can be classified as heavy hot Jupiters (M > 4 $M_{J}$).\n", "  We present experimental results on the influence of magnetic fields and laser\npolarization on electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) using Rydberg\nlevels of $^{87}$Rb atoms. The measurements are performed in a room temperature\nvapor cell with two counter-propagating laser beams at 480nm and 780nm in a\nladder-type energy level scheme. We measure the EIT spectrum of a range of\n$ns_{1/2}$ Rydberg states for $n=19-27$, where the hyperfine structure can\nstill be resolved. Our measurements span the range of magnetic fields from the\nlow field linear Zeeman regime to the high field Paschen-Back regimes. The\nobserved spectra are very sensitive to small changes in magnetic fields and the\npolarization of the laser beams. We model our observations using optical Bloch\nequations that take into account the full multi-level structure of the atomic\nstates involved and the decoupling of the electronic $J$ and nuclear $I$\nangular momenta in the Breit-Rabi regime. The numerical model yields excellent\nagreement with the observations. In addition to EIT related experiments, our\nresults are relevant for experiments involving coherent excitation to Rydberg\nlevels in the presence of magnetic fields.\n", "  We introduce $\\mathcal{B}_{\\kappa}$-embeddings, nonlinear mathematical\nstructures that connect, through smooth paths parameterized by $\\kappa$, a\nfinite or denumerable set of objects at $\\kappa=0$ (e.g. numbers, functions,\nvectors, coefficients of a generating function...) to their ordinary sum at\n$\\kappa \\to \\infty$. We show that $\\mathcal{B}_{\\kappa}$-embeddings can be used\nto design nonlinear irreversible processes through this connection. A number of\nexamples of increasing complexity are worked out to illustrate the\npossibilities uncovered by this concept. These include not only smooth\nfunctions but also fractals on the real line and on the complex plane. As an\napplication, we use $\\mathcal{B}_{\\kappa}$-embeddings to formulate a robust\nmethod for finding all roots of a univariate polynomial without factorizing or\ndeflating the polynomial. We illustrate this method by finding all roots of a\npolynomial of 19th degree.\n", "  We relate Gaussian curvature to the gyroscopic force, thus giving a\nmechanical interpretation of the former and a geometrical interpretation of the\nlatter. We do so by considering the motion of a spinning disk constrained to be\ntangent to a curved surface. It is shown that the spin gives rise to a force on\nthe disk which is equal to the magnetic force on a point charge moving in a\nmagnetic field normal to the surface, of magnitude equal to the Gaussian\ncurvature, and of charge equal to the disk's axial spin. In a special case,\nthis demonstrates that the precession of Lagrange's top is due to the curvature\nof a sphere determined by the parameters of the top.\n", "  In simulations of the standard cosmological model (LCDM), dark matter halos\nare aspherical. However, so far the asphericity of an individual galaxy's halo\nhas never been robustly established. We use the Jeans equations to define a\nquantity which robustly characterizes a deviation from rotational symmetry.\nThis quantity is essentially the gravitational torque and it roughly provides\nthe ellipticity projected along the line of sight. We show that the Thirty\nMeter Telescope (TMT), with a single epoch of observations combined with those\nof the Gaia space telescope, can distinguish the LCDM value of the torque from\nzero for each Sculptor-like dwarf galaxy with a confidence between 0 and 5\nsigma, depending on the orientation of each halo. With two epochs of\nobservations, TMT will achieve a 5 sigma discovery of torque and so asphericity\nfor most such galaxies, and so will provide a new and powerful test of the LCDM\nmodel.\n", "  The analytical description of the dynamics in models with discrete variables\n(e.g. Ising spins) is a notoriously difficult problem, that can be tackled only\nunder some approximation. Recently a novel variational approach to solve the\nstationary dynamical regime has been introduced by Pelizzola [Eur. Phys. J. B,\n86 (2013) 120], where simple closed equations are derived under mean-field\napproximations based on the cluster variational method. Here we propose to use\nthe same approximation based on the cluster variational method also for the\nnon-stationary regime, which has not been considered up to now within this\nframework. We check the validity of this approximation in describing the\nnon-stationary dynamical regime of several Ising models defined on\nErdos-R\\'enyi random graphs: we study ferromagnetic models with symmetric and\npartially asymmetric couplings, models with random fields and also spin glass\nmodels. A comparison with the actual Glauber dynamics, solved numerically,\nshows that one of the two studied approximations (the so-called 'diamond'\napproximation) provides very accurate results in all the systems studied. Only\nfor the spin glass models we find some small discrepancies in the very low\ntemperature phase, probably due to the existence of a large number of\nmetastable states. Given the simplicity of the equations to be solved, we\nbelieve the diamond approximation should be considered as the 'minimal\nstandard' in the description of the non-stationary regime of Ising-like models:\nany new method pretending to provide a better approximate description to the\ndynamics of Ising-like models should perform at least as good as the diamond\napproximation.\n", "  The transition from a many-body localized phase to a thermalizing one is a\ndynamical quantum phase transition which lies outside the framework of\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. We provide a detailed study of the critical\nproperties of this transition at finite sizes in one dimension. We find that\nthe entanglement entropy of small subsystems looks strongly subthermal in the\nquantum critical regime, which indicates that it varies discontinuously across\nthe transition as the system-size is taken to infinity, even though many other\naspects of the transition look continuous. We also study the variance of the\nhalf-chain entanglement entropy which shows a peak near the transition, and\nfind substantial variation in the entropy across eigenstates of the same\nsample. Further, the sample-to-sample variations in this quantity are strongly\ngrowing, and larger than the intra-sample variations. We posit that these\nresults are consistent with a picture in which the transition to the thermal\nphase is driven by an eigenstate-dependent sparse resonant \"backbone\" of\nlong-range entanglement, which just barely gains enough strength to thermalize\nthe system on the thermal side of the transition as the system size is taken to\ninfinity. This discontinuity in a global quantity --- the presence of a fully\nfunctional bath --- in turn implies a discontinuity even for local properties.\nWe discuss how this picture compares with existing renormalization group\ntreatments of the transition.\n", "  We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian quantum channel to\nhave a dilation involving a passive, i.e., number-preserving unitary. We then\nestablish a normal form of such channels: any passively dilatable channel is\nthe result of applying passive unitaries to the input and output of a Gaussian\nadditive channel. The latter combine the state of the system with that of the\nenvironment by means of a multi-mode beamsplitter.\n", "  Despite its enormous empirical success, the formalism of quantum theory still\nraises fundamental questions: why is nature described in terms of complex\nHilbert spaces, and what modifications of it could we reasonably expect to find\nin some regimes of physics? Here we address these questions by studying how\ncompatibility with thermodynamics constrains the structure of quantum theory.\nWe employ two postulates that any probabilistic theory with reasonable\nthermodynamic behavior should arguably satisfy. In the framework of generalized\nprobabilistic theories, we show that these postulates already imply important\naspects of quantum theory, like self-duality and analogues of projective\nmeasurements, subspaces and eigenvalues. However, they may still admit a class\nof theories beyond quantum mechanics. Using a thought experiment by von\nNeumann, we show that these theories admit a consistent thermodynamic notion of\nentropy, and prove that the second law holds for projective measurements and\nmixing procedures. Furthermore, we study additional entropy-like quantities\nbased on measurement probabilities and convex decomposition probabilities, and\nuncover a relation between one of these quantities and Sorkin's notion of\nhigher-order interference.\n", "  In this work, we propose a tool to reveal the origin of the collective-like\nphenomena observed in proton--proton collisions. We exploit the fundamental\ndifference between the underlying mechanisms, color reconnection (CR) and\nhydrodynamics, which produce radial flow patterns in \\textsc{Pythia}~8 and\n\\textsc{Epos}~3, respectively. Specifically, we proceed by examining the\nstrength of the coupling between the soft and hard components which, by\nconstruction, is larger in \\textsc{Pythia}~8 than in \\textsc{Epos}~3. We study\nthe transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) distributions of charged pions, kaons and\n(anti)protons in inelastic pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 7\\,TeV produced at\nmid-rapidity. Specific selections are made on an event-by-event basis as a\nfunction of the charged particle multiplicity and the transverse momentum of\nthe leading jet ($p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm jet}$) reconstructed using the\n\\textsc{FastJet} algorithm at mid-pseudorapidity ($|\\eta|<1$). From our\nstudies, quantitative and qualitative differences between \\textsc{Pythia}~8 and\n\\textsc{Epos}~3 are found in the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra when (for a given\nmultiplicity class) the leading jet $p_{\\rm T}$ is increased. In addition, we\nshow that for low-multiplicity events the presence of jets can produce radial\nflow-like behavior. Motivated by our findings, we propose to perform a similar\nanalysis using experimental data from RHIC and LHC.\n", "  Following the method of Froese and Herbst, we show for a class of potentials\nV that an eigenfunction $\\psi$ with eigenvalue E of the multi-dimensional\ndiscrete Schr\\\"odinger operator H = $\\Delta$ + V on \\mathbb{Z}^d decays\nsub-exponentially whenever the Mourre estimate holds at E. In the\none-dimensional case we further show that this eigenfunction decays\nexponentially with a rate at least of cosh^{--1}((E -- 2)/($\\theta$\\_E -- 2)),\nwhere $\\theta$\\_E is the nearest threshold of H located between E and 2. A\nconsequence of the latter result is the absence of eigenvalues between 2 and\nthe nearest thresholds above and below this value. The method of Combes-Thomas\nis also reviewed for the discrete Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n", "  We study numerically the reflectivity of three-dimensional (3D) photonic\ncrystals with a complete 3D photonic band gap, with the aim to interpret recent\nexperiments. We employ the finite element method to study crystals with the\ncubic diamond-like inverse woodpile structure. The high-index backbone has a\ndielectric function similar to silicon. We study crystals with a range of\nthicknesses up to ten unit cells ($L \\leq 10 c$). The crystals are surrounded\nby vacuum, and have a finite support as in experiments. The\npolarization-resolved reflectivity spectra reveal Fabry-P{\\'e}rot fringes\nrelated to standing waves in the finite crystal, as well as broad stop bands\nwith nearly $100~\\%$ reflectivity, even for thin crystals. From the strong\nreflectivity peaks, it is inferred that the maximum reflectivity observed in\nexperiments is not limited by finite size. The frequency ranges of the stop\nbands are in excellent agreement with stop gaps in the photonic band structure,\nthat pertain to infinite and perfect crystals. The frequency ranges of the\nobserved stop bands hardly change with angle of incidence, which is plausible\nsince the stop bands are part of the 3D band gap. Moreover, this result\nsupports the previous assertion that intense reflection peaks measured with a\nlarge numerical aperture provide a faithful signature of the 3D photonic band\ngap. The Bragg attenuation lengths $L_{B}$ exceed the earlier estimates based\non the width of the stop band by a factor $6$ to $9$. Hence crystals with a\nthickness of $12$ unit cells studied in experiments are in the thick crystal\nlimit ($L >> L_{B}$). In our calculations for p-polarized waves, we also\nobserve an intriguing hybridization of the zero reflection of Fabry-P{\\'e}rot\nfringes and the Brewster angle, which has not yet been observed in experiments.\n", "  Whilst the prospect of new $Z'$ gauge bosons with only axial couplings to the\nStandard Model (SM) fermions is widely discussed, examples of anomaly-free\nrenormalisable models are lacking in the literature. We look to remedy this by\nconstructing several motivated examples. Specifically, we consider axial\nvectors which couple universally to all SM fermions, as well as those which are\ngeneration-specific, leptophilic, and leptophobic. Anomaly cancellation\ntypically requires the presence of new coloured and charged chiral fermions,\nand we argue that in a large class of models masses of these new states are\nexpected to be comparable to that of the axial vector. Finally, an axial vector\nmediator could provide a portal between SM and hidden sector states, and we\nalso consider the possibility that the axial vector couples to dark matter. If\nthe dark matter relic density is set due to freeze-out via the axial vector,\nthis strongly constrains the parameter space.\n", "  Quantum phenomena have the potential to speed up the solution of hard\noptimization problems. For example quantum annealing, based on the quantum\ntunneling effect, has recently been shown to scale exponentially better with\nsystem size as compared with classical simulated annealing. However, current\nrealizations of quantum annealers with superconducting qubits face two major\nchallenges. First, the connectivity between the qubits is limited, excluding\nmany optimization problems from a direct implementation. Second, decoherence\ndegrades the success probability of the optimization. We address both of these\nshortcomings and propose an architecture in which the qubits are robustly\nencoded in continuous variable degrees of freedom. Remarkably, by leveraging\nthe phenomenon of flux quantization, all-to-all connectivity is obtained\nwithout overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of this\narchitecture by simulating the optimal solution of a small instance of the\nNP-hard and fully connected number partitioning problem in the presence of\ndissipation.\n", "  The absence of large cooling flows in cool core clusters appears to require\nself-regulated energy feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) but the exact\nheating mechanism has not yet been identified. Here, we analyse whether a\ncombination of cosmic ray (CR) heating and thermal conduction can offset\nradiative cooling. To this end, we compile a large sample of 39 cool core\nclusters and determine steady state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation. We find solutions that match the\nobserved density and temperature profiles for all our clusters well. Radiative\ncooling is balanced by CR heating in the cluster centres and by thermal\nconduction on larger scales, thus demonstrating the relevance of both heating\nmechanisms. Our mass deposition rates vary by three orders of magnitude and are\nlinearly correlated to the observed star formation rates. Clusters with large\nmass deposition rates show larger cooling radii and require a larger radial\nextent of the CR injection function. Interestingly, our sample shows a\ncontinuous sequence in cooling properties: clusters hosting radio mini halos\nare characterised by the largest cooling radii, star formation and mass\ndeposition rates in our sample and thus signal the presence of a higher cooling\nactivity. The steady state solutions support the structural differences between\nclusters hosting a radio mini halo and those that do not.\n", "  Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs). In contrast, the\npredicted non-thermal emission is well below observational data in cooling\ngalaxy clusters without RMHs. These are characterised by exceptionally large\nAGN radio fluxes, indicating high CR yields and associated CR heating rates. We\nsuggest a self-regulation cycle of AGN feedback in which non-RMH clusters are\nheated by streaming CRs homogeneously throughout the central cooling region. We\npredict {\\em radio micro halos} surrounding the AGNs of these CR-heated\nclusters in which the primary emission may predominate the hadronically\ngenerated emission. Once the CR population has streamed sufficiently far and\nlost enough energy, the cooling rate increases, which explains the increased\nstar formation rates in clusters hosting RMHs. Those could be powered\nhadronically by CRs that have previously heated the cluster core.\n", "  Quantum dynamics and kinetics of electrically gated graphene ribbons with\nlateral n-p and e-n-p junctions under magnetic field are investigated. It is\nshown that the snake-like states of quasiparticles skipping along the n-p\ninterface do not manifest themselve in the main semiclassical part of the\nribbon conductance. Giant oscillations of the conductance of a ribbon with an\nn-p-n junction are predicted and analytically calculated. Depending on the\nnumber of junctions inside the ribbon its magnetoresistance may be controllably\nchanged by 50% - 90% by an extremely small change of the magnetic field or the\ngate voltage.\n", "  We study the pairing symmetry of the interlayer paired state of composite\nfermions in quantum Hall bilayers. Based on the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory,\nthe effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction and the internal Chern-Simons\ngauge fluctuation is analyzed with the random-phase approximation beyond the\nleading order contribution in small momentum expansion, and we observe that the\ninterlayer paired states with a relative angular momentum $l=+1$ are\nenergetically favored for filling $\\nu=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}$ and\n$\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}$. The degeneracy between states with $\\pm l$ is lifted\nby the interlayer density-current interaction arising from the interplay of the\nlong-range Coulomb interaction and the Chern-Simons term in the HLR theory.\n", "  Stimulated by the recent implementation of a three-port Hall-effect microwave\ncirculator of Mahoney et al. (MEA), we present model studies of the performance\nof this device. Our calculations are based on the capacitive-coupling model of\nViola and DiVincenzo (VD). Based on conductance data from a typical Hall-bar\ndevice obtained from a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a magnetic field,\nwe numerically solve the coupled field-circuit equations to calculate the\nexpected performance of the circulator, as determined by the $S$ parameters of\nthe device when coupled to 50$\\Omega$ ports, as a function of frequency and\nmagnetic field. Above magnetic fields of 1.5T, for which a typical 2DEG enters\nthe quantum Hall regime (corresponding to a Landau-level filling fraction $\\nu$\nof 20), the Hall angle $\\theta_H=\\tan^{-1}\\sigma_{xy}/\\sigma_{xx}$ always\nremains close to $90^\\circ$, and the $S$ parameters are close to the analytic\npredictions of VD for $\\theta_H=\\pi/2$. As anticipated by VD, MEA find the\ndevice to have rather high (k$\\Omega$) impedance, and thus to be extremely\nmismatched to $50\\Omega$, requiring the use of impedance matching. We\nincorporate the lumped matching circuits of MEA in our modeling and confirm\nthat they can produce excellent circulation, although confined to a very small\nbandwidth. We predict that this bandwidth is significantly improved by working\nat lower magnetic field when the Landau index is high, e.g. $\\nu=20$, and the\nimpedance mismatch is correspondingly less extreme. Our modeling also confirms\nthe observation of MEA that parasitic port-to-port capacitance can produce very\ninteresting countercirculation effects.\n", "  The ability to measure nanoradian polarization rotations, $\\theta_F$, in the\nphoton shot noise limit is investigated for partially crossed polarizers (PCP),\na static Sagnac interferometer and an optical bridge, each of which can in\nprincipal be used in this limit with near equivalent figures-of-merit (FOM). In\npractice a bridge to PCP/Sagnac source noise rejection ratio of $1/4\\theta_F^2$\nenables the bridge to operate in the photon shot noise limit even at high light\nintensities. The superior performance of the bridge is illustrated via the\nmeasurement of a 3 nrad rotation arising from an axial magnetic field of 0.9 nT\napplied to a terbium gallium garnet. While the Sagnac is functionally\nequivalent to the PCP in terms of the FOM, unlike the PCP it is able to\ndiscriminate between rotations with different time ($T$) and parity ($P$)\nsymmetries. The Sagnac geometry implemented here is similar to that used\nelsewhere to detect non-reciprocal ($\\overline{T}P$) rotations like those due\nto the Faraday effect. Using a Jones matrix approach, novel Sagnac geometries\nuniquely sensitive to non-reciprocal $\\overline{TP}$ (e.g. magneto-electric or\nmagneto-chiral) rotations, as well as to reciprocal rotations (e.g. due to\nlinear birefringence, $TP$, or to chirality, $T\\overline{P}$) are proposed.\n", "  We propose a new scenario of the baryogenesis from primordial black holes\n(PBH). Assuming presence of microscopic baryon (or lepton) number violation and\na CP violating operator such as $\\partial_\\alpha F(\\mathcal{R_{....}} )\nJ^\\alpha$, where $F(\\mathcal{R_{....}})$ is a scalar function of the Riemann\ntensor, time evolution of an evaporating black hole generates baryonic\n(leptonic) chemical potential at the horizon; consequently PBH enumerates\nasymmetric Hawking radiation between baryons (leptons) and anti-baryons\n(leptons). Though the operator is higher dimensional and largely suppressed by\na high mass scale $M_*$, we show that sufficient amount of asymmetry can be\ngenerated for a wide range of parameters of the PBH mass $M_{\\rm PBH}$, its\nabundance $\\Omega_{\\rm PBH}$, and the scale $M_*$.\n", "  In view of future high-precision large-scale structure surveys, it is\nimportant to quantify the percent and subpercent level effects in cosmological\n$N$-body simulations from which theoretical predictions are drawn. One such\neffect involves deciding whether to zero all modes above the one-dimensional\nNyquist frequency, the so-called \"corner\" modes, in the initial conditions. We\ninvestigate this effect by comparing power spectra, density distribution\nfunctions, halo mass functions, and halo profiles in simulations with and\nwithout these modes. For a simulation with a mass resolution of $m_p \\sim\n10^{11}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$, we find that at $z>6$, the difference in the\nmatter power spectrum is large at wavenumbers above $\\sim 80$\\% of\n$k_{\\rm{Ny}}$, reducing to below 2\\% at all scales by $z\\sim 3$. Including\ncorner modes results in a better match between low- and high-resolution\nsimulations at wavenumbers around the Nyquist frequency of the low-resolution\nsimulation, but the effect of the corner modes is smaller than the effect of\nparticle discreteness. The differences in mass functions are 3\\% for the\nsmallest halos at $z=6$ for the $m_p \\sim 10^{11}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$\nsimulation, but we find no significant difference in the stacked profiles of\nwell-resolved halos at $z \\leq 6$. Thus removing power at\n$|\\mathbf{k}|>k_{\\rm{Ny}}$ in the initial conditions of cosmological\nsimulations has a small effect on small scales and high redshifts, typically\nbelow a few percent.\n", "  An original experimental setup has been elaborated in order to get a better\nview of turbulent flows in a von Karman geometry. The availability of a very\nfast camera allowed to follow in time the evolution of the flows. A surprising\nfinding is that the development of smaller whorls ceases earlier than expected\nand the aspect of the flows remains the same above Reynolds number of a few\nthousand. This fact provides an explanation of the constancy of the reduced\ndissipation in the same range without the need of singularity. Its cause could\nbe in relation with the same type of behavior observed in a rotating frame.\n", "  Memristors, memcapacitors, and meminductors, collectively called memelements,\nrepresent an innovative generation of circuit elements whose properties depend\non the state and history of the system. The hysteretic behavior of one of their\nconstituent variables, under the effect of an external time-dependent\nperturbation, is their distinctive fingerprint. In turn, this feature endows\nthem with the ability to both store and process information on the same\nphysical location, a property that is expected to benefit many applications\nranging from unconventional computing to adaptive electronics to robotics, to\nname just a few. For all these types of applications, it is important to find\nappropriate memelements that combine a wide range of memory states (multi-state\nmemory), long memory retention times, and protection against unavoidable noise.\nAlthough several physical systems belong to the general class of memelements,\nfew of them combine all of these important physical features in a single\ncomponent. Her we demonstrate theoretically a superconducting memory structure\nbased on solitonic long Josephson junctions (LJJs). We show that the Josephson\ncritical current of the junction behaves hysteretically as an external magnetic\nfield is properly swept. According to the hysteretic path displayed by the\ncritical current, a LJJ can be used as a multi-state memory, with a\ncontrollable number of available states. In addition, since solitons are at the\ncore of its operation, this system provides an intrinsic topological protection\nagainst external perturbations. Solitonic Josephson-based memelements may find\napplications as memories, and in other emerging areas such as memcomputing,\ni.e., computing directly in/by the memory.\n", "  We perform a likelihood analysis of the constraints from accelerator\nexperiments and astrophysical observations on supersymmetric (SUSY) models with\nSU(5) boundary conditions on soft SUSY-breaking parameters at the GUT scale.\nThe parameter space of the models studied has 7 parameters: a universal gaugino\nmass $m_{1/2}$, distinct masses for the scalar partners of matter fermions in\nfive- and ten-dimensional representations of SU(5), $m_5$ and $m_{10}$, and for\nthe $\\mathbf{5}$ and $\\mathbf{\\bar 5}$ Higgs representations $m_{H_u}$ and\n$m_{H_d}$, a universal trilinear soft SUSY-breaking parameter $A_0$, and the\nratio of Higgs vevs $\\tan \\beta$. In addition to previous constraints from\ndirect sparticle searches, low-energy and flavour observables, we incorporate\nconstraints based on preliminary results from 13 TeV LHC searches for jets +\nMET events and long-lived particles, as well as the latest PandaX-II and LUX\nsearches for direct Dark Matter detection. In addition to previously-identified\nmechanisms for bringing the supersymmetric relic density into the range allowed\nby cosmology, we identify a novel ${\\tilde u_R}/{\\tilde c_R} -\n\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1$ coannihilation mechanism that appears in the supersymmetric\nSU(5) GUT model and discuss the role of ${\\tilde \\nu_\\tau}$ coannihilation. We\nfind complementarity between the prospects for direct Dark Matter detection and\nSUSY searches at the LHC.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the $\\beta$ function at one-loop approximation for\nnoncommutative scalar QED. The renormalization of the full theory, including\nthe basic vertices, and the renormalization group equation are fully\nestablished. Next, the complete set of the one-loop diagrams corresponding to\nthe first-order radiative corrections to the basic functions is considered:\ngauge, charged scalar and ghost fields self-energies, and three- and four-point\nvertex functions $\\left<\\phi^\\dag \\phi A\\right>$ and $\\left<\\phi^\\dag \\phi A\nA\\right>$, respectively. We pay special attention to the noncommutative\ncontributions to the renormalization constants. To conclude, the one-loop\n$\\beta$ function of noncommutative scalar QED is then computed and comparison\nto known results is presented.\n", "  Inference methods are often formulated as variational approximations: these\napproximations allow easy evaluation of statistics by marginalization or linear\nresponse, but these estimates can be inconsistent. We show that by introducing\nconstraints on covariance, one can ensure consistency of linear response with\nthe variational parameters, and in so doing inference of marginal probability\ndistributions is improved. For the Bethe approximation and its generalizations,\nimprovements are achieved with simple choices of the constraints. The\napproximations are presented as variational frameworks; iterative procedures\nrelated to message passing are provided for finding the minima.\n", "  Parafermions are emergent excitations that generalize Majorana fermions and\ncan also realize topological order. In this paper we present a non-trivial and\nquasi-exactly-solvable model for a chain of parafermions in a topological\nphase. We compute and characterize the ground-state wave-functions, which are\nmatrix-product states and have a particularly elegant interpretation in terms\nof Fock parafermions, reflecting the factorized nature of the ground states.\nUsing these wavefunctions, we demonstrate analytically several signatures of\ntopological order. Our study provides a starting point for the non-approximate\nstudy of topological one-dimensional parafermionic chains with\nspatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry in the absence of strong edge\nmodes.\n", "  A Rn-220 source is deployed on the XENON100 dark matter detector in order to\naddress the challenges in calibration of tonne-scale liquid noble element\ndetectors. We show that the Pb-212 beta emission can be used for low-energy\nelectronic recoil calibration in searches for dark matter. The isotope spreads\nthroughout the entire active region of the detector, and its activity naturally\ndecays below background level within a week after the source is closed. We find\nno increase in the activity of the troublesome Rn-222 background after\ncalibration. Alpha emitters are also distributed throughout the detector and\nfacilitate calibration of its response to Rn-222. Using the delayed coincidence\nof Rn-220/Po-216, we map for the first time the convective motion of particles\nin the XENON100 detector. Additionally, we make a competitive measurement of\nthe half-life of Po-212, t = 293.9+-(1.0)+-(0.6) ns.\n", "  We describe a method to control the directional scattering of a high index\ndielectric nanosphere, which utilizes the unique focusing properties of an\nazimuthally polarized phase vortex and a radially polarized beam to\nindependently excite insde the nanosphere a spinning magnetic dipole and a\nlinearly polarized electric dipole mode normal to the magnetic dipole. We show\nthat by simply adjusting the phase and amplitude of the field on the exit pupil\nof the optical system, the scattering of the nanosphere can be tuned to any\ndirection within a plane and the method works over a broad wavelength range.\n", "  We present a new implementation of the Cluster Variational Method (CVM) as a\nmessage passing algorithm. The kind of message passing algorithms used for CVM,\nusually named Generalized Belief Propagation, are a generalization of the\nBelief Propagation algorithm in the same way that CVM is a generalization of\nthe Bethe approximation for estimating the partition function. However, the\nconnection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM\nfree-energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence, because of the\nexistence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages.\n  Our contribution is twofold. Firstly we propose a new way of defining\nmessages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on\na given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as\nin the standard Parent-to-Child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages.\nSecondly we focus on the case of binary variables, re-interpreting the messages\nas fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal)\nprobability distributions. We provide a precise rule to enforce all\nconsistencies, avoiding any redundancy, that would otherwise lead to a gauge\ntransformation on the messages. This moment matching method is gauge free, i.e.\nit guarantees that the resulting GBP is not gauge invariant.\n  We apply our maximal messages and moment matching GBP to obtain an analytical\nexpression for the critical temperature of the Ising model in general\ndimensions at the level of plaquette-CVM. The values obtained outperform Bethe\nestimates, and are comparable with loop corrected Belief Propagation equations.\nThe method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems.\n", "  A giant thermal magnetoresistance is predicted for the electromagnetic\ntransport of heat in magneto-optical plasmonic structures. In chains of InSb-Ag\nnanoparticles at room temperature, we found that the resistance can be\nincreased by almost a factor of 2 with magnetic fields of 2 T. We show that\nthis important change results from the strong spectral dependence of localized\nsurface waves on the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n", "  We approach the problem of finding generalized states for matter fields in a\nde Sitter universe, moving from a group theoretical point of view. This has\nprofound consequences for cosmological perturbations during inflation, and for\nother CMB observables. In a systematic derivation, we find all the allowed\ngeneralities that such a state may have, within the requirements of coherent\nstates. Furthermore, we show their relation to the more familiar excited\ninitial states, often used in inflation.\n", "  I suggest a minimal extension of the SM with $U(1)_{B-L}\\otimes Z_{2}$. It\ncan simultaneously accommodate the tiny neutrino mass, cold dark mater and\nbaryon asymmetry besides the SM. All of the new physics arise from the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ violation at the energy scale about 1000 TeV. The model can\nnaturally explain the \"WIMP Miracle\" and elegantly achieve the leptogenesis, in\naddition, some predictions of the model are possible and promising to be tested\nin near future experiments.\n", "  It is proved that spherically symmetric compact reflecting objects cannot\nsupport static bound-state configurations made of scalar fields whose\nself-interaction potential $V(\\psi^2)$ is a monotonically increasing function\nof its argument. Our theorem rules out, in particular, the existence of massive\nscalar hair outside the surface of a spherically symmetric compact reflecting\nstar.\n", "  The Dirac operator in finite temperature QCD is equivalent to the Hamiltonian\nof an unconventional Anderson model, with on-site noise provided by the\nfluctuations of the Polyakov lines. The main features of its spectrum and\neigenvectors, concerning the density of low modes and their localization\nproperties, are qualitatively reproduced by a toy-model random Hamiltonian,\nbased on an Ising-type spin model mimicking the dynamics of the Polyakov lines.\nHere we study the low modes of this toy model in the vicinity of the ordering\ntransition of the spin model, and show that at the critical point the spectral\ndensity at the origin has a singularity, and the localization properties of the\nlowest modes change. This provides further evidence of the close relation\nbetween deconfinement, chiral transition and localization of the low modes.\n", "  The symplectic Wisdom-Holman map revolutionized long-term integrations of\nplanetary systems. There is freedom in such methods of how to split the\nHamiltonian and which coordinate system to employ, and several options have\nbeen proposed in the literature. These choices lead to different integration\nerrors, which we study analytically and numerically. The Wisdom-Holman method\nin Jacobi coordinates and the method of Hernandez, H16, compare favorably and\navoid problems of some of the other maps, such as incorrect center-of-mass\nposition or truncation errors even in the one-planet case. We use H16 to\ncompute the evolution of Pluto's orbital elements over 500 million years in a\nnew calculation.\n", "  Motivated by the challenge of seeking a rigorous foundation for the\nbulk-boundary correspondence for free fermions, we introduce an algorithm for\ndetermining exactly the spectrum and a generalized-eigenvector basis of a class\nof banded block quasi-Toeplitz matrices that we call corner-modified. Corner\nmodifications of otherwise arbitrary banded block-Toeplitz matrices capture the\neffect of boundary conditions and the associated breakdown of translational\ninvariance. Our algorithm leverages the interplay between a non-standard,\nprojector-based method of kernel determination (physically, a bulk-boundary\nseparation) and families of linear representations of the algebra of matrix\nLaurent polynomials. Thanks to the fact that these representations act on\ninfinite-dimensional carrier spaces in which translation symmetry is restored,\nit becomes possible to determine the eigensystem of an auxiliary projected\nblock-Laurent matrix. This results in an analytic eigenvector Ansatz,\nindependent of the system size, which we prove is guaranteed to contain the\nfull solution of the original finite-dimensional problem. The actual solution\nis then obtained by imposing compatibility with a boundary matrix, also\nindependent of system size. As an application, we show analytically that\neigenvectors of short-ranged fermionic tight-binding models may display\npower-law corrections to exponential decay, and demonstrate the phenomenon for\nthe paradigmatic Majorana chain of Kitaev.\n", "  The physics of tunneling from one spacetime into another is often understood\nin terms of instantons. For some instantons, it was recently shown in the\nliterature that there are two complementary \"interpretations\" for their\nanalytic continuations. Dubbed \"something-to-something\" and\n\"nothing-to-something\" interpretations, respectively, the former involves\nsituation in which the initial and final hypersurfaces are connected by a\nEuclidean manifold, whereas the initial and final hypersurfaces in the latter\ncase are not connected in such a way. We consider a de Sitter space with real\nprojective space $\\mathbb{R}\\text{P}^3$ spatial sections, as was originally\nunderstood by de Sitter himself. This original version of de Sitter space has\nseveral advantages over the usual de Sitter space with $\\text{S}^3$ spatial\nsections. In particular, the interpretation of the de Sitter entropy as\nentanglement entropy is much more natural. We discuss the subtleties involved\nin the tunneling of such a de Sitter space.\n", "  We examine most-likely paths between initial and final states for diffusive\nquantum trajectories in continuously monitored pure-state qubits, obtained as\nextrema of a stochastic path integral. We demonstrate the possibility of\n\"multipaths\" in the dynamics of continuously-monitored qubit systems, wherein\nmultiple most-likely paths travel between the same pre- and post-selected\nstates over the same time interval. Most-likely paths are expressed as\nsolutions to a Hamiltonian dynamical system. The onset of multipaths may be\ndetermined by analyzing the evolution of a Lagrange manifold in this phase\nspace, and is mathematically analogous to the formation of caustics in ray\noptics or semiclassical physics. Additionally, we develop methods for finding\noptimal traversal times between states, or optimal final states given an\ninitial state and evolution time; both give insight into the measurement\ndynamics of continuously-monitored quantum states. We apply our methods in two\nsystems: a qubit with two non-commuting observables measured simultaneously,\nand a qubit measured in one observable while subject to Rabi drive. In the\ntwo-observable case we find multipaths due to caustics, bounded by a diverging\nVan-Vleck determinant, and their onset time. We also find multipaths generated\nby paths with different \"winding numbers\" around the Bloch sphere in both\nsystems.\n", "  Superconductivity of transition metal dichalcogenide $1T$-TiTe$_2$ under high\npressure was investigated by the first-principles calculations. Our results\nshow that the superconductivity of $1T$-TiTe$_2$ exhibits very different\nbehavior under the hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure. The hydrostatic pressure\nis harmful to the superconductivity, while the uniaxial pressure is beneficial\nto the superconductivity. Superconducting transition temperature $T_C$ at\nambient pressure is 0.73 K, and it reduces monotonously under the hydrostatic\npressure to 0.32 K at 30 GPa. While the $T_C$ increases dramatically under the\nuniaxial pressure along $c$ axis. The established $T_C$ of 6.34 K under the\nuniaxial pressure of 17 GPa, below which the structural stability maintains, is\nabove the liquid helium temperature of 4.2 K. The increase of density of states\nat Fermi level, the redshift of $F(\\omega)$/$\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$ and the\nsoftening of the acoustic modes with pressure are considered as the main\nreasons that lead to the enhanced superconductivity under uniaxial pressure. In\nview of the previously predicted topological phase transitions of $1T$-TiTe$_2$\nunder the uniaxial pressure [Phys. Rev. B 88, 155317 (2013)], we consider\n$1T$-TiTe$_2$ as a possible candidate in transition metal chalcogenides for\nexploring topological superconductivity.\n", "  With the first two detections in late 2015, astrophysics has officially\nentered into the new era of gravitational wave observations. Since then, much\nhas been going on in the field with a lot of work focussing on the observations\nand implications for astrophysics and tests of general relativity in the strong\nregime. However much less is understood about how gravitational detectors\nreally work at their fundamental level. For decades, the response to incoming\nsignals has been customarily calculated using the very same physical principle,\nwhich has proved so successful in the first detections. In this paper we review\nthe physical principle that is behind such a detection at the very fundamental\nlevel, and we try to highlight the peculiar subtleties that make it so hard in\npractice. We will then mention how detectors are built starting from this\nfundamental measurement element.\n", "  We consider transfer of a highly nonclassical quantum state through an\noptomechanical system. That is we investigate a protocol consisting of\nsequential upload, storage and reading out of the quantum state from a\nmechanical mode of an optomechanical system. We show that provided the input\nstate is in a test-bed single-photon Fock state, the Wigner function of the\nrecovered state can have negative values at the origin, which is a manifest of\nnonclassicality of the quantum state of the macroscopic mechanical mode and the\noverall transfer protocol itself. Moreover, we prove that the recovered state\nis quantum non-Gaussian for wide range of setup parameters. We verify that\ncurrent electromechanical and optomechanical experiments can test this complete\ntransfer of single photon.\n", "  A degenerate fermionic vacuum population is suggested. Based on the abundance\nof the dark energy density in the Universe the vacuum particle mass and number\ndensity are estimated. The obtained mass is in reasonable agreement with\nobservations and predictions of the neutrino mass. Number densities are higher\nthan those of the relativistic relic neutrino component.\n", "  We discuss heat transport in a thermally-biased SQUID in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic flux, when a non-negligible inductance of the SQUID ring is\ntaken into account. A properly sweeping driving flux causes the thermal current\nto modulate and behave hysteretically. The response of this device is analysed\nas a function of both the hysteresis parameter and degree of asymmetry of the\nSQUID, highlighting the parameter range over which hysteretic behavior is\nobservable. Markedly, also the temperature of the SQUID shows hysteretic\nevolution, with sharp transitions characterized by temperature jumps up to,\ne.g., ~ 38mK for a realistic Al-based setup. In view of these results, the\nproposed device can effectively find application as a temperature-based\nsuperconducting memory element, working even at GHz frequencies by suitably\nchoosing the superconductor on which the device is based.\n", "  Particles confined to a single file, in a narrow quasi-one dimensional\nchannel, exhibit a dynamic crossover from single file diffusion to Fickian\ndiffusion as the channel radius increases and the particles can begin to pass\neach other. The long time diffusion coefficient for a system in the crossover\nregime can be described in terms of a hopping time, which measures the time it\ntakes for a particle to escape the cage formed by its neighbours. In this\npaper, we develop a transition state theory approach to the calculation of the\nhopping time, using the small system isobaric--isothermal ensemble to\nrigorously account for the volume fluctuations associated with the size of the\ncage. We also describe a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that can be used to\ncalculate the free energy barrier for particle hopping. The theory and\nsimulation method correctly predict the hopping times for a two dimensional\nconfined ideal gas system and a system of confined hard discs over a range of\nchannel radii, but the method breaks down for wide channels in the hard discs\ncase, underestimating the height of the hopping barrier due to the neglect of\ninteractions between the small system and its surroundings.\n", "  Samarium has two stable valence states, 2+ and 3+, which coexist in many\ncompounds forming spatially homogeneous intermediate valence states. We study\nthe valence state of samarium when incorporated in a single crystalline EuO\nthin film which crystallizes in a $fcc$-structure similar to that of the\nintermediate valence SmO, but with a larger lattice constant. Due to the\nincreased lattice spacing, a stabilization of the larger Sm$^{2+}$ ion is\nexpected. Surprisingly, the samarium incorporated in\nSm$_{\\mathrm{x}}$Eu$_{\\mathrm{1-x}}$O thin films shows a predominantly\ntrivalent character, as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and\nmagnetometry measurements. We infer that the O$^{2-}$ ions in the EuO lattice\nhave enough room to move locally, so as to reduce the Sm-O distance and\nstabilize the Sm$^{3+}$ valence.\n", "  According to recent studies, the collective flavor evolution of neutrinos in\ncore-collapse supernovae depends strongly on the flavor-dependent angular\ndistribution of the local neutrino radiation field, notably on the angular\nintensity of the electron-lepton number carried by neutrinos. To facilitate\nfurther investigations of this subject, we study the energy and angle\ndistributions of the neutrino radiation field computed with the Vertex\nneutrino-transport code for several spherically symmetric (1D) supernova\nsimulations (of progenitor masses 11.2, 15 and 25 M_sun) and explain how to\nextract this information from additional models of the Garching group.\nBeginning in the decoupling region (\"neutrino sphere\"), the distributions are\nmore and more forward peaked in the radial direction with an angular spread\nthat is largest for $\\nu_e$, smaller for $\\bar\\nu_e$, and smallest for $\\nu_x$,\nwhere $x=\\mu$ or $\\tau$. While the energy-integrated $\\nu_e$ minus $\\bar\\nu_e$\nangle distribution has a dip in the forward direction, it does not turn\nnegative in any of our investigated cases.\n", "  A quality assurance and performance qualification laboratory was built at\nMcGill University for the Canadian-made small-strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC)\nmuon detectors produced for the 2019-2020 ATLAS experiment muon spectrometer\nupgrade. The facility uses cosmic rays as a muon source to ionise the quenching\ngas mixture of pentane and carbon dioxide flowing through the sTGC detector. A\ngas system was developed and characterised for this purpose, with a simple and\nefficient gas condenser design utilizing a Peltier thermoelectric cooler (TEC).\nThe gas system was tested to provide the desired 45 vol% pentane concentration.\nFor continuous operations, a state-machine system was implemented with alerting\nand remote monitoring features to run all cosmic-ray data-acquisition\nassociated slow-control systems, such as high/low voltage, gas system and\nenvironmental monitoring, in a safe and continuous mode, even in the absence of\nan operator.\n", "  We present a vacuum window mechanism that is useful for applications\nrequiring two different vacuum windows in series, with one of them movable and\nresealable. Such applications include space borne instruments that can benefit\nfrom a thin vacuum window at low ambient pressures, but must also have an\noptically open aperture at atmospheric pressures. We describe the\nimplementation and successful operation with the EBEX balloon-borne payload, a\nmillimeter-wave instrument designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation.\n", "  We extend Lamb's reduced density matrix laser theory to analyze the\ninhomogeneous molecular couplings and the mode-correlation in a plasmonic\nnano-laser consisting of a gold sphere and many dye molecules interacting with\na driving optical field and with the quantized plasmon modes. The molecular\ninhomogeneity is accounted for by simulating their random distribution around\nthe sphere. Our analysis shows that in order to obtain lasing we must employ a\nlarge number of strongly driven molecules to compensate strong damping of the\nplasmon modes. The compact molecular arrangement, however, can lead to\nmolecular energy-shifts and thus reduce the excitation of the plasmon modes and\nultimately suggests a maximum limit for the plasmon excitation for any specific\nsystem.\n", "  We theoretically examine the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard dimer in the\noptical bistable regime. Various approximation schemes based on a Gutzwiller\nmean field decoupling are applied and compared. Depending on the system\nparameters we show that a decoupling with respect to the real space or to the\nreciprocal space can be more accurate. The Gutzwiller decoupling is applied\nboth at the level of the density matrix and for the wavefunction during a\nquantum trajectory simulation. The latter is shown to be a more accurate\napproximation. A Gaussian approximation for the non-homogeneous anti-bonding\nmode is also explored. We also show that entanglement in this system is\nwitnessed by squeezing in reciprocal space.\n", "  The validity of General Relativity, after 100 years, is supported by solid\nexperimental evidence. However, there is a lot of interest in pushing the\nlimits of precision by other experiments. Here we focus our attention on the\nequivalence principle, in particular the strong form. The results of ground\nexperiments and lunar laser ranging have provided the best upper limit on the\nNordtvedt parameter {\\eta} that models deviations from the strong equivalence\nprinciple. Its uncertainty is currently {\\sigma}[{\\eta}] =4.4 $\\times$\n$10^{-4}$. In the first part of this paper we will describe the experiment, to\nmeasure {\\eta}, that will be done by the future mission BepiColombo. The\nexpected precision on {\\eta} is $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$. In the second part we will\nconsider the ranging between the Earth and a spacecraft orbiting near the\nSun-Earth Lagrangian points to get an independent measurement of {\\eta}. In\nthis case, we forecast a constraint similar to that achieved by lunar laser\nranging.\n", "  We investigate how the constraint results of inflation models are affected by\nconsidering the latest local measurement of $H_0$ in the global fit. We use the\nobservational data, including the Planck CMB full data, the BICEP2 and Keck\nArray CMB B-mode data, the BAO data, and the latest measurement of Hubble\nconstant, to constrain the $\\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$N_{\\rm eff}$ model, and the\nobtained 1$\\sigma$ and 2$\\sigma$ contours of $(n_s, r)$ are compared to the\ntheoretical predictions of selected inflationary models. We find that, in this\nfit, the scale invariance is only excluded at the 3.3$\\sigma$ level, and\n$\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}>0$ is favored at the 1.6$\\sigma$ level. The natural\ninflation model is now excluded at more than 2$\\sigma$ level; the Starobinsky\n$R^2$ model becomes only favored at around 2$\\sigma$ level; the most favored\nmodel becomes the spontaneously broken SUSY inflation model; and, the brane\ninflation model is also well consistent with the current data, in this case.\n", "  It is considered the 6D brane model where matter is trapped on the surface of\na (2+4)-hyperboloid, as is suggested by the geometrical structure behind the 4D\nconformal group. The effective dimension of the bulk space-time for matter\nfields is five, with the extra space-like and time-like domains. Using the\nembedding theory the presence of the familiar factorizable 5D brane metrics in\nthe both domains is shown. These metrics with exponential warp factors are able\nto provide with the additional reduction of the effective space-time dimensions\ndown to four. It is demonstrated that the extra (1+1)-space is not simply\nconnected and there is a gap in the range of the extra coordinates. This can\nexplain stability of the model in the domain with the time-like effective fifth\ndimension and the appearance of the cosmological constant due to the tachyon\ncondensation. It is found that the model exhibits orbifold symmetry and thus is\nfree from the fermion chirality problem.\n", "  Recent experimental results for neutron-neutron scattering length are\nreanalyzed from the point of view of three-nucleon force contribution. We found\nthat the limiting value of $a_{nn}=- 15.8\\pm 0.5$~fm must be free of any\nimplicit three-body force contribution. We have also shown that the difference\nbetween the above experimental value of $a_{nn}$ and the well established value\nof neutron-proton scattering length $a_{np}$ can be explained by differences in\nthe one-pion exchange potentials.\n", "  We discuss the synchrotron emission of fast cooling electrons in shocks. The\nfast cooling electrons behind the shocks can generate a position-dependent\ninhomogeneous electron distribution if they do not have enough time to mix\nhomogeneously. This would lead to a very different synchrotron spectrum in\nlow-frequency bands to that in the homogeneous case due to the synchrotron\nabsorption. In this paper, we calculate the synchrotron spectrum in the\ninhomogeneous case in a gamma-ray burst (GRB). Both the forward shock and the\nreverse shock are considered. We find for the reverse shock dominated case, we\nwould expect a \"reverse shock bump\" in the low-frequency spectrum. The spectral\nbump is due to the combination synchrotron absorption in both the forward and\nreverse shock regions. In the forward shock spectrum in the low frequencies has\ntwo unconventional segments with spectral slopes of $\\lesssim1$ and $11/8$. The\nslope of $11/8$ has been found by some authors, while the slope of $\\lesssim1$\nis new, which is due to the approximately constant electron temperature in the\noptically thick region. In the future, simultaneous observations in multiple\nbands (especially in the low frequency bands) in the GRB early afterglow or\nprompt emission phases will possibly reveal these spectral characteristics and\nenable us to identify the reverse shock component and distinguish between the\nforward and reverse shock emissions. This also may be a method with which to\ndiagnose the electron distribution status (homogeneous or inhomogeneous) after\nfast cooling in the relativistic shock region.\n", "  Anthropic arguments of Carter, Carr, and Rees give two approximate power-law\nrelations between the elementary charge e, the mass of the proton m_p, and the\nmass of the electron m_e in Planck units: m_p ~ e^{18}, m_e ~ e^{21}. A\nrenormalization group argument of mine gives e^{-2} ~ -(10/pi)ln{m_p}.\nCombining this with the Carter-Carr-Rees relations gives e^2 ln{e} ~ -pi/180.\nTaking the exact solutions of these approximate equations gives values for e,\nm_p, and m_e whose logarithms have relative errors only 0.7%, 1.3%, and 1.0%\nrespectively, without using as input the observed values of any parameters with\npotentially continuous ranges. One can then get anthropic estimates for the\nmasses, sizes, luminosities, times, velocities, etc. for many other structures\nin physics and astronomy, from atoms to giraffes to the universe, as simple\npowers of the anthropic estimate for the elementary charge. For example, one\ngets an anthropic estimate for the real part of the logarithm of the dark\nenergy density with a relative error of only 0.2%.\n", "  A monistic framework is set up where energy is the only fundamental\nsubstance. Different states of energy are ordered by a set of scalar\nqunatum-phase-fields. The dual elements of matter, mass and space, are\ndescribed as volume- and gradient-energy contributions of the set of fields,\nrespectively. Time and space are formulated as background-independent dynamic\nvariables. The evolution equations of the body of the universe are derived from\nfirst principles of thermodynamics. Gravitational interaction emerges from\nquantum fluctuations in finite space. Application to a large number of fields\npredicts scale separation in space and repulsive action of masses distant\nbeyond a marginal distance. The predicted marginal distance is compared to the\nsize of the voids in the observable universe.\n", "  We use recent Belle results on $\\bar{B}^0\\rightarrow D^{*+}l^-\\bar{\\nu}_l$\ndecays to extract the CKM element $|V_{cb}|$ with two different but\nwell-founded parameterizations of the form factors. We show that the CLN and\nBGL parameterizations lead to quite different results for $|V_{cb}|$ and\nprovide a simple explanation of this unexpected behaviour. A long lasting\ndiscrepancy between the inclusive and exclusive determinations of $|V_{cb}|$\nmay have to be thoroughly reconsidered.\n", "  Given the importance of crystal symmetry for the emergence of topological\nquantum states, we have studied, as exemplified in NbNiTe2, the interplay of\ncrystal symmetry, atomic displacements (lattice vibration), band degeneracy,\nand band topology. For NbNiTe2 structure in space group 53 (Pmna) - having an\ninversion center arising from two glide planes and one mirror plane with a\n2-fold rotation and screw axis - a full gap opening exists between two band\nmanifolds near the Fermi energy. Upon atomic displacements by optical phonons,\nthe symmetry lowers to space group 28 (Pma2), eliminating one glide plane along\nc, the associated rotation and screw axis, and the inversion center. As a\nresult, twenty Weyl points emerge, including four type-II Weyl points in the\nG-X direction at the boundary between a pair of adjacent electron and hole\nbands. Thus, optical phonons may offer control of the transition to a Weyl\nfermion state.\n", "  We are experimentally investigating possible violations of standard quantum\nmechanics predictions in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy. We\ntest with high precision the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the collapse of the\nwave function (collapse models). We present our method of searching for\npossible small violations of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) for electrons,\nthrough the search for anomalous X-ray transitions in copper atoms, produced by\nfresh electrons (brought inside the copper bar by circulating current) which\ncan have the probability to undergo Pauli-forbidden transition to the 1 s level\nalready occupied by two electrons and we describe the VIP2 (VIolation of PEP)\nexperiment under data taking at the Gran Sasso underground laboratories. In\nthis paper the new VIP2 setup installed in the Gran Sasso underground\nlaboratory will be presented. The goal of VIP2 is to test the PEP for electrons\nwith unprecedented accuracy, down to a limit in the probability that PEP is\nviolated at the level of 10$^{-31}$. We show preliminary experimental results\nand discuss implications of a possible violation.\n", "  The evolution of opinions in a population of individuals who constantly\ninteract with a common source of user-generated content (i.e. the internet) and\nare also subject to propaganda is analyzed using computer simulations. The\nmodel is based on the bounded confidence approach. In the absence of\npropaganda, computer simulations show that the online population as a whole is\neither fragmented, polarized or in perfect harmony on a certain issue or\nideology depending on the uncertainty of individuals in accepting opinions not\ncloser to theirs. On applying the model to simulate radicalization, a\nproportion of the online population, subject to extremist propaganda radicalize\ndepending on their pre-conceived opinions and opinion uncertainty. It is found\nthat an optimal counter propaganda that prevents radicalization is not\nnecessarily centrist.\n", "  AGN outflows can remove large quantities of gas from their host galaxy\nspheroids, potentially shutting off star formation. On the other hand, they can\ncompress this gas, potentially enhancing or triggering star formation, at least\nfor short periods. We present a set of idealised simulations of AGN outflows\naffecting turbulent gas spheres, and investigate the effect of the outflow and\nthe AGN radiation field upon gas fragmentation. We show that AGN outflows of\nsufficient luminosity shut off fragmentation while the nucleus is active, but\ngas compression results in a burst of fragmentation after the AGN switches off.\nSelf-shielding of gas against the AGN radiation field allows some fragmentation\nto occur during outbursts, but too much shielding results in a lower overall\nfragmentation rate. For our idealised simulation setup, there is a critical AGN\nluminosity which results in the highest fragmentation rate, with outflows being\ntoo efficient at removing gas when $L > L_{\\rm crit}$ and not efficient enough\nto compress the gas to high densities otherwise. These results, although\npreliminary, suggest that the interaction between AGN and star formation in\ntheir host galaxies is particularly complex and requires careful study in order\nto interpret observations correctly.\n", "  Although it is commonly believed that all the volumetric optical force laws\nshould lead to the same total optical force for chiral and achiral objects,\nthis idea has been invalidated in some recent works by investigating several\nprevious experiments involving material background. To identify the exact\nreason of such significant disagreement, we inspect two tractor beam and one\nlateral force experiments on using distinct stress tensors (STs). To solve the\nproblems of total force, we propose two consistency conditions of time averaged\nforces. We demonstrate that exactly at the boundary of an object, the\ndifference of the consistent external Minkowski ST and internal ST of Chu (and\nEinstein-Laub) is found in agreement with the surface force yielded by Chu (and\nEinstein-Laub) force only when the background is air rather than a material. We\nidentify this as one of the main reasons (among few other identified reasons)\nof the disagreements observed for real experiments. Finally, based on the\nproposed consistency conditions, we demonstrate that: by modifying the\nEinstein-Laub or Chu formulation, time-averaged STs and volume forces are\nobtainable those can overcome the aforementioned inconsistencies of real\nexperiments for both chiral and achiral Mie objects embedded in even complex\nmaterial backgrounds.\n", "  In this study, we develop a theoretical model of strategic equilibrium\nbidding and price-setting behaviour by heterogeneous and boundedly rational\nelectricity producers and a grid operator in a single electricity market under\nuncertain information about production capabilities and electricity demand.\n  We compare eight different market design variants and several levels of\ncentralized electricity production that influence the spatial distribution of\nproducers in the grid, their unit production and curtailment costs, and the\nmean and standard deviation of their production capabilities.\n  Our market design variants differ in three aspects. Producers are either paid\ntheir individual bid price (\"pay as bid\") or the (higher) market price set by\nthe grid operator (\"uniform pricing\"). They are either paid for their bid\nquantity (\"pay requested\") or for their actual supply (\"pay supplied\") which\nmay differ due to production uncertainty. Finally, excess production is either\nrequired to be curtailed or may be supplied to the grid.\n  Overall, we find the combination of uniform pricing, paying for requested\namounts, and required curtailment to perform best or second best in many\nrespects, and to provide the best compromise between the goals of low economic\ncosts, low consumer costs, positive profits, low balancing, low workload, and\nhonest bidding behaviour.\n", "  Ultra Fast Silicon Detectors (UFSD) are sensors optimized for timing\nmeasurements employing a thin multiplication layer to increase the output\nsignal. A multipurpose read-out board hosting a low-cost, low-power fast\namplifier was designed at the University of Kansas and tested at the European\nOrganization for Nuclear Research (CERN) using a 180 GeV pion beam. The\namplifier has been designed to read out a wide range of detectors and it was\noptimized in this test for the UFSD output signal. In this paper we report the\nresults of the experimental tests using 50 $\\rm{\\mu m}$ thick UFSD with a\nsensitive area of 1.4 $\\rm{mm^2}$. A timing precision below 30 ps was achieved.\n", "  We study triangulated surface models with nontrivial surface metrices for\nmembranes. The surface model is defined by a mapping ${\\bf r}$ from a two\ndimensional parameter space $M$ to the three dimensional Euclidean space ${\\bf\nR}^3$. The metric variable $g_{ab}$, which is always fixed to the Euclidean\nmetric $\\delta_{ab}$, can be extended to a more general non-Euclidean metric on\n$M$ in the continuous model. The problem we focus on in this paper is whether\nsuch an extension is well-defined or not in the discrete model. We find that a\ndiscrete surface model with nontrivial metric becomes well-defined if it is\ntreated in the context of Finsler geometry (FG) modeling, where triangle edge\nlength in $M$ depends on the direction. It is also shown that the discrete FG\nmodel is orientation assymetric on invertible surfaces in general, and for this\nreason, the FG model has a potential advantage for describing real physical\nmembranes, which are expected to have some assymetries for orientation changing\ntransformations.\n", "  A series of brief reviews collected in the present issue present various\ncandidates for cosmological Dark Matter (DM) predicted by models of particle\nphysics. The range from superlight axions to extended objects is covered.\nThough the possible list of candidates is far from complete it gives the flavor\nof the extensive field of Dark matter particle physics.\n", "  The DFT calculations were performed of densities of states of semiconductor\nGaAs and magnetic semiconductor Ga0.9375Mn0.0625As. It is obtained that a part\nof Mn3d- states is hybridized with valence band at Fermi level. The exchange\nintegrals of Anderson impurity model were calculated making use of atomic\nHartree-Fock package and angular momentum coupling technique. Theoretical Tc of\nGa0.9375Mn0.0625As obtained in the multiscale ab initio method is in reasonable\nagreement with experiment. The application of Hubbard parameters in DFT\ncalculations using ultrasoft pseudopotentials is discussed.\n", "  We build a minimal extension of General Relativity in which Newton's\ngravitational coupling, $G$, the speed of light, $c$, and the cosmological\nconstant, $\\Lambda$, are spacetime variables. This is done while satisfying the\ncontracted Bianchi identity as well as the local conservation of energy\nmomentum tensor. A dynamical constraint is derived, which shows that variations\nof $G$ and $c$ are coupled to the local matter-energy physical content, while\nvariation of $\\Lambda$ is coupled to the local geometry. This constraint\npresents a natural cosmological screening mechanism that brings new perspective\nconcerning the current observations of a cosmological constant, $\\Lambda_0$ in\ncosmological observations. We also explore early universe background cosmology\nand show that the proposal provides alternatives to obtain an accelerated\nexpansion, similar to those coming from Varying Speed of Light theories.\n", "  The combination of graphene with semiconductor materials in heterostructure\nphotodetectors, has enabled amplified detection of femtowatt light signals\nusing micron-scale electronic devices. Presently, the speed of such detectors\nis limited by long-lived charge traps and impractical strategies, e.g. the use\nof large gate voltage pulses, have been employed to achieve bandwidths suitable\nfor applications, such as video-frame-rate imaging. Here, we report atomically\nthin graphene-WS$_2$ heterostructure photodetectors encapsulated in an ionic\npolymer, which are uniquely able to operate at bandwidths up to 1.5 kHz, whilst\nmaintaining internal gain as large as $10^6$. Highly mobile ions and a\nnanometre scale Debye length of the ionic polymer are used to screen charge\ntraps and tune the Fermi level of graphene over an unprecedented range at the\ninterface with WS$_2$. We observe a responsivity $R=10^6$ A W$^{-1}$ and\ndetectivity $D^*=3.8\\times10^{11}$ Jones, approaching that of single photon\ncounters. The combination of both high responsivity and fast response times\nmakes these photodetectors suitable for video-frame-rate imaging applications.\n", "  Starting from the semi-analytic construction of a equation of state (EoS)\nwhich takes into account nuclear and quark matter at finite temperature, we\nstudy the possibility that proto-neutron stars, be proto-hybrid stars whose\ncores are composed of quark matter. We obtain the mass-radius relationship and\ndiscuss the latest constraints on masses and radii of neutron stars,\nconsidering the pulsars PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0348 + 0432.\n", "  Motivated by recent findings that human mobility is proxy for crime behavior\nin big cities and that there is a superlinear relationship between the people's\nmovement and crime, this article aims to evaluate the impact of how these\nfindings influence police allocation. More precisely, we shed light on the\ndifferences between an allocation strategy, in which the resources are\ndistributed by clusters of floating population, and conventional allocation\nstrategies, in which the police resources are distributed by an Administrative\nArea (typically based on resident population). We observed a substantial\ndifference in the distributions of police resources allocated following these\nstrategies, what evidences the imprecision of conventional police allocation\nmethods.\n", "  Detection and precise localization of nano-scale structures buried beneath\nspin coated films are highly valuable additions to nano-fabrication technology.\nIn principle, the topography of the final film contains information about the\nlocation of the buried features. However, it is generally believed that the\nrelation is masked by flow effects, which lead to an upstream shift of the dry\nfilm's topography and render precise localization impossible. Here we\ndemonstrate, theoretically and experimentally, that the flow-shift paradigm\ndoes not apply at the sub-micron scale. Specifically, we show that the resist\ntopography is accurately obtained from a convolution operation with a symmetric\nGaussian Kernel whose parameters solely depend on the resist characteristics.\nWe exploit this finding for a 3 nm precise overlay fabrication of metal\ncontacts to an InAs nanowire with a diameter of 27 nm using thermal scanning\nprobe lithography.\n", "  As the calorimetric method of neutrino-energy reconstruction is generally\nconsidered to be largely insensitive to nuclear effects, its application seems\nto be an effective way for reducing systematic uncertainties in oscillation\nexperiments. To verify the validity of this opinion, we quantitatively study\nthe sensitivity of the calorimetric energy reconstruction to the effect of\nfinal-state interactions in an ideal detector and in a realistic scenario. We\nfind that when particles escaping detection carry away a non-negligible\nfraction of neutrino energy, the calorimetric reconstruction method becomes\nsensitive to nuclear effects which, in turn, affects the outcome of the\noscillation analysis. These findings suggest that the best strategy for\nreduction of systematic uncertainties in future neutrino-oscillation\nstudies---such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment---is to increase\ntheir sensitivity to particles of low energy. The ambitious precision goals\nappear also to require an extensive development of theoretical models capable\nof providing an accurate predictions for exclusive cross sections of\nwell-controlled uncertainties.\n", "  The paradigmatic example of a continuous quantum phase transition is the\ntransverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems,\nwhose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature\nof a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse\nfield Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved and increasing the\ntransverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough\nto restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudo-spins can represent\nthe order parameter of any system with a two-fold degenerate broken-symmetry\nphase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous\npoint-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of\norbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or\na perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby\nproviding a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum\ncritical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly\nunrelated order parameters, their non-trivial commutation relations with the\nnematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an\neffective field theory, intrinsically intertwines the different order\nparameters.\n", "  We study the Neumann Laplacian operator $-\\Delta_\\Omega^N$ restricted to a\ntwisted waveguide $\\Omega$. The goal is to find the effective operator when the\ndiameter of $\\Omega$ tends to zero. However, when $\\Omega$ is \"squeezed\" there\nare divergent eigenvalues due to the transverse oscillations. We show that each\none of these eigenvalues influences the action of the effective operator in a\ndifferent way. In the case where $\\Omega$ is periodic and sufficiently thin, we\nfind information about the absolutely continuous spectrum of $-\\Delta_\\Omega^N$\nand the existence and location of band gaps in its structure.\n", "  An \"ultimate\" high intensity proton source for neutrino factories and/or muon\ncolliders was projected to be a ~4 MW multi-GeV proton source providing short,\nintense proton pulses at ~15 Hz. The JPARC ~1 MW accelerators provide beam at\nparameters that in many respects overlap these goals. Proton pulses from the\nJPARC Main Ring can readily meet the pulsed intensity goals. We explore these\nparameters, describing the overlap and consider extensions that may take a\nJPARC-like facility toward this \"ultimate\" source. JPARC itself could serve as\na stage 1 source for such a facility.\n", "  A covariant relativistic formalism for the electron-photon and nuclear\ndynamics is summarised making more accurate predictions in agreement with\nexperiments for Compton scattering in shells with large electron binding\nenergy. An exact solution for the Dirac equation for an electron in the nuclear\nCoulomb field is obtained, in order to write the relativistic dynamics for this\nQED process. This is a preparation for the calculation of the relativistic\ncross-section for Compton scattering on bound electrons; as a precision test\nfor QED.\n", "  In a partnership with SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC) and\nJefferson Lab, Fermilab will assemble and test 17 of the 35 total 1.3 GHz\ncryomodules for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) Project. These\ndevices will be tested at Fermilab's Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) within the\nCryomodule Test Stand (CMTS-1) cave. The problem of magnetic pollution became\none of major issues during design stage of the LCLS-II cryomodule as the\naverage quality factor of the accelerating cavities is specified to be $2.7\n\\times 10^{10}$. One of the possible ways to mitigate the effect of stray\nmagnetic fields and to keep it below the goal of 5 mGauss involves the\napplication of low permeable materials. Initial permeability and magnetic\nmeasurement studies regarding the use of 316L stainless steel material\nindicated that cold work (machining) and heat affected zones from welding would\nbe acceptable.\n", "  In semiconductors, quantum confinement can greatly enhance the interaction\nbetween band carriers (electrons and holes) and dopant atoms. One manifestation\nof this enhancement is the increased stability of exciton magnetic polarons in\nmagnetically-doped nanostructures. In the limit of very strong 0D confinement\nthat is realized in colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, a single exciton can\nexert an effective exchange field $B_{\\rm{ex}}$ on the embedded magnetic\ndopants that exceeds several tesla. Here we use the very sensitive method of\nresonant photoluminescence (PL) to directly measure the presence and properties\nof exciton magnetic polarons in colloidal Cd$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Se nanocrystals.\nDespite small Mn$^{2+}$ concentrations ($x$=0.4-1.6\\%), large polaron binding\nenergies up to $\\sim$26~meV are observed at low temperatures via the\nsubstantial Stokes shift between the pump laser and the resonant PL maximum,\nindicating nearly complete alignment of all Mn$^{2+}$ spins by $B_{\\rm{ex}}$.\nTemperature and magnetic field-dependent studies reveal that $B_{\\rm{ex}}\n\\approx$ 10~T in these nanocrystals, in good agreement with theoretical\nestimates. Further, the emission linewidths provide direct insight into the\nstatistical fluctuations of the Mn$^{2+}$ spins. These resonant PL studies\nprovide detailed insight into collective magnetic phenomena, especially in\nlightly-doped nanocrystals where conventional techniques such as nonresonant PL\nor time-resolved PL provide ambiguous results.\n", "  Ammoniation in metal borohydrides (MBs) with the form\n$\\mathcal{M}$(BH$_4$)$_x$ has been shown to lower their decomposition\ntemperatures with $\\mathcal{M}$ of low electronegativity ($\\chi_p \\lesssim\n1.6$), but raise it for high-$\\chi_p$ MBs ($\\chi_p \\gtrsim 1.6$). Although this\nbehavior is just as desired, an understanding of the mechanisms that cause it\nis still lacking. Using \\emph{ab initio} methods, we elucidate those mechanisms\nand find that ammoniation always causes thermodynamic destabilization,\nexplaining the observed lower decomposition temperatures for low-$\\chi_p$ MBs.\nFor high-$\\chi_p$ MBs, we find that ammoniation blocks B$_2$H$_6$\nformation---the preferred decomposition mechanism in these MBs---and thus\nkinetically stabilizes those phases. The shift in decomposition pathway that\ncauses the distinct change from destabilization to stabilization around\n$\\chi_p=1.6$ thus coincides with the onset of B$_2$H$_6$ formation in MBs.\nFurthermore, with our analysis we are also able to explain why these materials\nrelease either H$_2$ or NH$_3$ gas upon decomposition. We find that NH$_3$ is\nmuch more strongly coordinated with higher-$\\chi_p$ metals and direct H$_2$\nformation/release becomes more favorable in these materials. Our findings are\nof importance for unraveling the hydrogen release mechanisms in an important\nnew and promising class of hydrogen storage materials, allowing for a guided\ntuning of their chemistry to further improve their properties.\n", "  A high-energy muon collider scenario requires a final cooling system that\nreduces transverse emittance to ~25 microns (normalized) while allowing\nlongitudinal emittance increase. Ionization cooling using high-field solenoids\n(or Li Lens) can reduce transverse emittances to ~100 microns in readily\nachievable configurations, confirmed by simulation. Passing these muon beams at\n~100 MeV/c through cm-sized diamond wedges can reduce transverse emittances to\n~25 microns, while increasing longitudinal emittances by a factor of ~25.\nImplementation will require optical matching of the exiting beam into\ndownstream acceleration systems.\n", "  The paper discusses an advanced level information system to support\neducational, research and scientific activities of the Department\n\"Electrophysical Facilities\" (DEF) of the National Research Nuclear University\n\"MEPhI\" (NRNU MEPhI), which is used for training of specialists of the course\n\"Physics of Charged Particle Beams and Accelerator Technology\".\n", "  In the present study, superheating treatment has been applied on A357\nreinforced with 0.5 wt. % (Composite 1) and 1.0 wt.% (Composite 2) continuous\nstainless steel composite. In Composite 1 the microstructure displayed poor\nbonding between matrix and reinforcement interface. Poor bonding associated\nwith large voids also can be seen in Composite 1. The results also showed that\ncoarser eutectic silicon (Si) particles were less intensified around the\nmatrix-reinforcement interface. From energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)\nelemental mapping, it was clearly shown that the distribution of eutectic Si\nparticles were less concentrated at poor bonding regions associated with large\nvoids. Meanwhile in Composite 2, the microstructure displayed good bonding\ncombined with more concentrated finer eutectic Si particles around the\nmatrix-reinforcement interface. From EDS elemental mapping, it was clearly\nshowed more concentrated of eutectic Si particles were distributed at the good\nbonding area. The superheating prior to casting has influenced the\nmicrostructure and tends to produce finer, rounded and preferred oriented\n{\\alpha}-Al dendritic structures.\n", "  Nanostructured metals subject to local optical interrogation can generate\nopen-circuit photovoltages potentially useful for energy conversion and\nphotodetection. We report a study of the photovoltage as a function of\nillumination position in single metal Au nanowires and nanowires with nanogaps\nformed by electromigration. We use a laser scanning microscope to locally heat\nthe metal nanostructures via excitation of a local plasmon resonance and direct\nabsorption. In nanowires without nanogaps, where charge transport is diffusive,\nwe observe voltage distributions consistent with thermoelectricity, with the\nlocal Seebeck coefficient depending on the width of the nanowire. In the\nnanowires with nanogaps, where charge transport is by tunneling, we observe\nlarge photovoltages up to tens of mV, with magnitude, polarization dependence,\nand spatial localization that follow the plasmon resonance in the nanogap. This\nis consistent with a model of photocurrent across the nanogap carried by the\nnonequilibrium, \"hot\" carriers generated upon the plasmon excitation.\n", "  We discuss self-consistently obtained ground-state electronic properties of\nmonolayers of graphene and a number of beyond graphene compounds, including\nfilms of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), using the recently proposed\nstrongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-generalized gradient\napproximation (meta-GGA) to the density functional theory. The SCAN meta-GGA\nresults are compared with those based on the local density approximation (LDA)\nas well as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). As expected, the GGA\nyields expanded lattices and softened bonds in relation to the LDA, but the\nSCAN meta-GGA systematically improves the agreement with experiment. Our study\nsuggests the efficacy of the SCAN functional for accurate modeling of\nelectronic structures of layered materials in high-throughput calculations more\ngenerally.\n", "  Spicules and other solar jets such as bright points and fibrils generally\nshow a parabolic height-time relationship, which means that each spicule has a\nconstant deceleration. However the deceleration is only constant for a\nparticular spicule and varies widely from one spicule or jet to another.\nNonetheless the careful observations of a number of researchers show that the\ndistance - time relationship is parabolic to a high level of precision. The\nmeasurements for heights, maximum velocities, decelerations and flight times\nare normally presented as histograms or scatter plots, which allow some general\ntrends to be observed. The published results show a clear correlation between\nthe maximum velocity and the deceleration of spicules on scatter plots. This\ncorrelation has been claimed to show a linear relation between the acceleration\nand the maximum velocity of a jet. This linear relationship has been used to\nhelp model the mechanisms responsible for the jets. However it is proposed here\nthat the relation between velocity and acceleration is given by the normal\nequations of motion for constant acceleration and consequently the relationship\nis non-linear. Other correlations are also examined and the implications for\nspicule mechanisms are considered.\n", "  The initial results of a two year simultaneous optical-radar meteor campaign\nare described. Analysis of 105 double-station optical meteors having plane of\nsky intersection angles greater than 5 degrees and trail lengths in excess of 2\nkm also detected by the Middle Atmosphere Alomar Radar System (MAARSY) as head\nechoes was performed. These events show a median deviation in radiants between\nradar and optical determinations of 1.5 degrees, with 1/3 of events having\nradiant agreement to less than one degree. MAARSY tends to record average\nspeeds roughly 0.5 km/s and 1.3 km higher than optical records, in part due to\nthe higher sensitivity of MAARSY as compared to the optical instruments. More\nthan 98% of all head echoes are not detected with the optical system. Using\nthis non-detection ratio and the known limiting sensitivity of the cameras, we\nestimate that the limiting meteoroid detection mass of MAARSY is in the 10-9 kg\nto 10-10 kg (astronomical limiting meteor magnitudes of +11 to +12) appropriate\nto speeds from 30-60 km/s. There is a clear trend of higher peak RCS for\nbrighter meteors between 35 and -30 dBsm. For meteors with similar magnitudes,\nthe MAARSY head echo radar cross-section is larger at higher speeds. Brighter\nmeteors at fixed heights and similar speeds have consistently, on average,\nlarger RCS values, in accordance with established scattering theory. However,\nour data show RCS ~ v/2, much weaker than the normally assumed RCS ~ v^3, a\nconsequence of our requiring head echoes to also be detectable optically. Most\nevents show a smooth variation of RCS with height broadly following the light\nproduction behavior. A significant minority of meteors show large variations in\nRCS relative to the optical light curve over common height intervals,\nreflecting fragmentation or possibly differential ablation.\n", "  The definition of accessible coherence is proposed. Through local measurement\non the other subsystem and one way classical communication, a subsystem can\naccess more coherence than the coherence of its density matrix. Based on the\nlocal accessible coherence, the part that can not be locally accessed is also\nstudied, which we call it remaining coherence. We study how the bipartite\ncoherence is distributed by partition for both l1 norm coherence and relative\nentropy coherence, and the expressions for local accessible coherence and\nremaining coherence are derived. we also study some examples to illustrate the\ndistribution.\n", "  Multiphoton processes in undulators with plane polarized magnetic field are\nconsidered. It is shown that the use of strong magnetic fields in the\nundulator, for beams with relatively low energy makes it possible to increase\nsubstantially the frequencies of the amplified electromagnetic waves without\nnoticeably decreasing the gain. The absorption, emission probabilities and the\ngain are calculated.\n", "  The effect of radiative heat-loss function and finite ion Larmor radius (FLR)\ncorrections on the thermal instability of infinite homogeneous viscous plasma\nhas been investigated incorporating the effects of thermal conductivity and\nfinite electrical resistivity for the formation of a molecular cloud. The\ngeneral dispersion relation is derived using the normal mode analysis method\nwith the help of relevant linearized perturbation equations of the problem.\nFurthermore the wave propagation along and perpendicular to the direction of\nexternal magnetic field has been discussed. Stability of the medium is\ndiscussed by applying Routh Hurwitzs criterion and it is found that thermal\ninstability criterion determines the stability of the medium. We find that the\npresence of radiative heat-loss function and thermal conductivity modify the\nfundamental criterion of thermal instability into radiatively driven thermal\ninstability criterion. In longitudinal direction FLR corrections, viscosity,\nmagnetic field and finite resistivity have no effect on thermal instability\ncriterion. The presence of radiative heat-loss function and thermal\nconductivity modify the fundamental thermal instability criterion into\nradiatively driven thermal instability criterion. Also the FLR corrections\nmodify the growth rate of the Alfven mode. For transverse wave propagation FLR\ncorrections, radiative heat-loss function, magnetic field and thermal\nconductivity modify the thermal instability criterion. From the curves it is\nclear that heat-loss function, FLR corrections and viscosity have stabilizing\neffect, while finite resistivity has destabilizing effect on the thermal modes.\nOur results show that the FLR corrections and radiative heat-loss functions\naffect the evolution of interstellar molecular clouds and star formation.\n", "  This study investigated the unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional\nquantum walks. We determined the unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional\nquantum walks, two-phase quantum walks with one defect, complete two-phase\nquantum walks, one-dimensional quantum walks with one defect and\ntranslation-invariant one-dimensional quantum walks. The unitary equivalent\nclasses of one-dimensional quantum walks with initial states were also\nconsidered.\n", "  In this paper, by comparing the time scales associated with the velocity\nrelaxation and correlation time of the random force due to dust charge\nfluctuations, memory effects in the velocity relaxation of an isolated dust\nparticle exposed to the random force due to dust charge fluctuations are\nconsidered, and the velocity relaxation process of the dust particle is\nconsidered as a non-Markovian stochastic process. Considering memory effects in\nthe velocity relaxation process of the dust particle yields a retarded friction\nforce, which is introduced by a memory kernel in the fractional Langevin\nequation. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the dust grain is derived\nfrom this equation. The mean-square displacement and the velocity\nautocorrelation function of the dust particle are obtained, and their\nasymptotic behavior, the dust particle temperature due to charge fluctuations,\nand the diffusion coefficient are studied in the long-time limit. As an\ninteresting feature, it is found that by considering memory effects in the\nvelocity relaxation process of the dust particle, fluctuating force on the dust\nparticle can cause an anomalous diffusion in a dusty plasma. In this case, the\nmean-square displacement of the dust grain increases slower than linearly with\ntime, and the velocity autocorrelation function decays as a power-law instead\nof the exponential decay. Finally, in the Markov limit, these results are in\ngood agreement with those obtained from previous works for Markov (memoryless)\nprocess of the velocity relaxation.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the theoretical study of plasmonic resonances\nfor linear elasticity governed by the Lam\\'e system in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, and\ntheir application for cloaking due to anomalous localized resonances. We derive\na very general and novel class of elastic structures that can induce plasmonic\nresonances. It is shown that if either one of the two convexity conditions on\nthe Lam\\'e parameters is broken, then we can construct certain plasmon\nstructures that induce resonances. This significantly extends the relevant\nexisting studies in the literature where the violation of both convexity\nconditions is required. Indeed, the existing plasmonic structures are a\nparticular case of the general structures constructed in our study.\nFurthermore, we consider the plasmonic resonances within the finite frequency\nregime, and rigorously verify the quasi-static approximation for diametrically\nsmall plasmonic inclusions. Finally, as an application of the newly found\nstructures, we construct a plasmonic device of the core-shell-matrix form that\ncan induce cloaking due to anomalous localized resonance in the quasi-static\nregime, which also includes the existing study as a special case.\n", "  Background: The Skyrme energy density functional is widely used in mean-field\ncalculations of nuclear structure and dynamics. However, its reliance on\nphenomenology may compromise its isovector properties and its performance for\nexotic nuclear systems.\n  Purpose: This work investigates the possibility of removing some\nphenomenology from the density functional by drawing on the high-energy\ndegrees-of-freedom of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The QMC model has\nmicroscopically derived isovector properties and far fewer adjustable\nparameters.\n  Method: The parameters of the Skyrme interaction are fixed using the energy\ndensity functional of the QMC model, to give the Skyrme-QMC (SQMC)\nparameterisation.\n  Results: Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations of the Sn, Pb and $N=126$\nchains are reported, in which SQMC performs with an accuracy comparable to\nmodern phenomenological functionals.\n  Conclusions: The isovector terms of the energy density functional are\nsignificant for the binding energies of neutron-rich nuclei. The isovector\ndependence of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction must be taken into account for\ncalculations of r-process nucleosynthesis abundances.\n", "  The Tsallis entropy given for a positive parameter $\\alpha$ can be considered\nas a modification of the classical Shannon entropy. For the latter,\ncorresponding to $\\alpha=1$, there exist many axiomatic characterizations. One\nof them based on the well-known Khinchin-Shannon axioms has been simplified\nseveral times and adapted to Tsallis entropy, where the axiom of (generalized)\nShannon additivity is playing a central role. The main aim of this paper is to\ndiscuss this axiom in the context of Tsallis entropy. We show that it is\nsufficient for characterizing Tsallis entropy with the exceptions of cases\n$\\alpha=1,2$ discussed separately.\n", "  In the present paper, we are considering a spatially-flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological model, fueled with stiff matter and\ndust, treated as non-interacting ideal fluid sources. By solving the\ncorresponding Friedmann equation with a non-zero cosmological constant, we are\nderiving the scale function and the fundamental cosmological parameters. Within\na thermodynamic approach, the general form of the Equation of State is\nobtained, together with the explicit dependence of the energy density and\npressure on temperature.\n", "  The evolution of the aging process of glassy materials quenched from\ntemperatures above their glass transition temperature $T_g$, when plotting the\nrelaxed enthalpy versus the decrease in volume, leads to a slope comparable to\nthe isothermal compressibility close to $T_g$. This empirical result was\nexplained in an earlier publication (V. Katsika-Tsigourakou, G. E. Zardas J.\nNon-Cryst. Solids 356 (2010) 179-180) by means of a thermodynamical model.\nHere, we show that the same model enables the explanation of the rare cases of\nnegative defect activation in solids.\n", "  Recent observations have shown that at a certain composition of solid\nsolutions AgCl$_x$Br$_{1-x}$, AgCl-CdCl$_2$, AgBr-CdBr$_2$, of ionic crystals,\nthe electrical conductivity exhibits a value appreciably larger than that of\nthe end constituents. Here, we investigate the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$\nof LiH$_x$D$_{1-x}$ solid solutions -which are of prominent importance in fuel\nhydrogen storage applications- and find that in the whole composition range no\nmaximum is likely to occur in the $\\sigma$ versus x dependence.\n", "  We study the energy spectra of bound states in quantum dots (QDs) formed by\nan electrostatic potential in two-dimensional topological insulator (TI) and\ntheir transformation with changes in QD depth and radius. It is found that,\nunlike a trivial insulator, the energy difference between the levels of the\nground state and first excited state can decrease with decreasing the radius\nand increasing the depth of the QD so that these levels intersect under some\ncritical conditions. The crossing of the levels results in unusual features of\noptical properties caused by intracenter electron transitions. In particular,\nit leads to significant changes of light absorption due to electron transitions\nbetween such levels and to the transient electroluminescence induced by\nelectrical tuning of QD and TI parameters. In the case of magnetic TIs, the\npolarization direction of the absorbed or emitted circularly polarized light is\nchanged due to the level crossing.\n", "  Plants emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is involved in a wide\nclass of ecological functions, as VOCs play a crucial role in plants\ninteractions with biotic and abiotic factors. Accordingly, they vary widely\nacross species and underpin differences in ecological strategy. In this paper,\nVOCs spontaneously emitted by 109 plant species (belonging to 56 different\nfamilies) have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in order to\nclassify plants species. By using bipartite networks methodology, based on\nrecent advancements in Complex Network Theory, and through the application of\ncomplementary classical and advanced community detection algorithms, the\npossibility to classify species according to chemical classes such as terpenes\nand sulfur compounds is suggested. This indicates complex network analysis as\nan advantageous methodology to uncover plants relationships also related to the\nway they react to the environment where they evolve and adapt.\n", "  In electronic structure methods based on the correction of approximate\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) for systematic inaccuracies, Hubbard $U$\nparameters may be used to quantify and amend the self-interaction errors\nascribed to selected subspaces. Here, in order to enable the accurate,\ncomputationally convenient calculation of $U$ by means of DFT algorithms that\nlocate the ground-state by direct total-energy minimization, we introduce a\nreformulation of the successful linear-response method for $U$ in terms of the\nfully-relaxed constrained ground-state density. Defining $U$ as an implicit\nfunctional of the ground-state density implies the comparability of DFT +\nHubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) total-energies, and related properties, as external\nparameters such as ionic positions are varied together with their corresponding\nfirst-principles $U$ values. Our approach provides a framework in which to\naddress the partially unresolved question of self-consistency over $U$, for\nwhich plausible schemes have been proposed, and to precisely define the energy\nassociated with subspace many-body self-interaction error. We demonstrate that\nDFT+$U$ precisely corrects the total energy for self-interaction error under\nideal conditions, but only if a simple self-consistency condition is applied.\nSuch parameters also promote to first-principles a recently proposed DFT+$U$\nbased method for enforcing Koopmans' theorem.\n", "  The WAGASCI experiment being built at the J-PARC neutrino beam line will\nmeasure the difference in cross sections from neutrinos interacting with a\nwater and scintillator targets, in order to constrain neutrino cross sections,\nessential for the T2K neutrino oscillation measurements. A prototype Magnetised\nIron Neutrino Detector (MIND), called Baby MIND, is being constructed at CERN\nto act as a magnetic spectrometer behind the main WAGASCI target to be able to\nmeasure the charge and momentum of the outgoing muon from neutrino charged\ncurrent interactions.\n", "  We consider the problem of inferring the probability distribution of flux\nconfigurations in metabolic network models from empirical flux data. For the\nsimple case in which experimental averages are to be retrieved, data are\ndescribed by a Boltzmann-like distribution ($\\propto e^{F/T}$) where $F$ is a\nlinear combination of fluxes and the `temperature' parameter $T\\geq 0$ allows\nfor fluctuations. The zero-temperature limit corresponds to a Flux Balance\nAnalysis scenario, where an objective function ($F$) is maximized. As a test,\nwe have inverse modeled, by means of Boltzmann learning, the catabolic core of\nEscherichia coli in glucose-limited aerobic stationary growth conditions.\nEmpirical means are best reproduced when $F$ is a simple combination of biomass\nproduction and glucose uptake and the temperature is finite, implying the\npresence of fluctuations. The scheme presented here has the potential to\ndeliver new quantitative insight on cellular metabolism. Our implementation is\nhowever computationally intensive, and highlights the major role that effective\nalgorithms to sample the high-dimensional solution space of metabolic networks\ncan play in this field.\n", "  All-solid-state strong light-matter coupling systems with large vacuum Rabi\nsplitting are great important for quantum information application, such as\nquantum manipulation, quantum information storage and processing. The monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored as excellent\ncandidates for the strong light-matter interaction, due to their extraordinary\nexciton binding energies and remarkable optical properties. Here, for both of\nexperimental and theoretical aspects, we explored resonance coupling effect\nbetween exciton and plasmonic nanocavity in heterostructures consisting of\nmonolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and an individual Au nanorod. We also\nstudy the influences on the resonance coupling of various parameters, including\nlocalized surface plasmon resonances of Au nanorods with varied topological\naspects, separation between Au nanorod and monolayer WSe2 surface, and the\nthickness of WSe2. More importantly, the resonance coupling can approach the\nstrong coupling regime at room-temperature by selecting appropriate parameters,\nwhere an anti-crossing behavior with the vacuum Rabi splitting strength of 98\nmeV was observed on the energy diagram.\n", "  The use of computers in statistical physics is common because the sheer\nnumber of equations that describe the behavior of an entire system particle by\nparticle often makes it impossible to solve them exactly. Monte Carlo methods\nform a particularly important class of numerical methods for solving problems\nin statistical physics. Although these methods are simple in principle, their\nproper use requires a good command of statistical mechanics, as well as\nconsiderable computational resources. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate\nhow the usage of widely accessible graphics cards on personal computers can\nelevate the computing power in Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude,\nthus allowing live classroom demonstration of phenomena that would otherwise be\nout of reach. As an example, we use the public goods game on a square lattice\nwhere two strategies compete for common resources in a social dilemma\nsituation. We show that the second-order phase transition to an absorbing phase\nin the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and we\ncompare the time needed to arrive at this result by means of the main processor\nand by means of a suitable graphics card. Parallel computing on graphics\nprocessing units has been developed actively during the last decade, to the\npoint where today the learning curve for entry is anything but steep for those\nfamiliar with programming. The subject is thus ripe for inclusion in graduate\nand advanced undergraduate curricula, and we hope that this paper will\nfacilitate this process in the realm of physics education. To that end, we\nprovide a documented source code for an easy reproduction of presented results\nand for further development of Monte Carlo simulations of similar systems.\n", "  In layered transition metal dichalcogenides (LTMDCs) that display both charge\ndensity waves (CDWs) and superconductivity, the superconducting state generally\nemerges directly on suppression of the CDW state. Here, however, we report a\ndifferent observation for pressurized TaTe2, a non-superconducting CDW-bearing\nLTMDC at ambient pressure. We find that a superconducting state does not occur\nin TaTe2 after the full suppression of its CDW state, which we observe at about\n3 GPa, but, rather, a non-superconducting semimetal state is observed. At a\nhigher pressure, ~21 GPa, where both the semimetal state and the corresponding\npositive magnetoresistance effect are destroyed, superconductivity finally\nemerges and remains present up to ~50 GPa, the high pressure limit of our\nmeasurements. Our pressure-temperature phase diagram for TaTe2 demonstrates\nthat the CDW and the superconducting phases in TaTe2 do not directly transform\none to the other, but rather are separated by a semimetal state, - the first\nexperimental case where the CDW and superconducting states are separated by an\nintermediate phase in LTMDC systems.\n", "  The physical constructs underlying the properties of quantum mechanics are\nexplored. Arguments are given that the particle wave function as well as photon\nand phonon quanta must derive from a more fundamental physical construct that\nhas not yet been identified. An approach to identifying the construct is\ndiscussed and a specific construct is proposed and explained.\n", "  We model quasi-two-dimensional two-electron Quantum Dots in a parabolic\nconfinement potential with rovibrational and purely vibrational effective\nHamiltonian operators. These are optimized by non-linear least-square fits to\nthe exact energy levels. We find, that the vibrational Hamiltonian describes\nthe energy levels well and reveals how relative contributions change on varying\nthe confinement strength. The rovibrational model suggests the formation of a\nrigid two-electron molecule in weak confinement and we further present a\nmodified model, that allows a very accurate transition from weak to strong\nconfinement regimes.\n", "  Advances in ultra-intense laser technology are enabling, for the first time,\nrelativistic intensities at mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths. Anticipating\nfurther experimental research in this domain, we present high-resolution two\ndimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulation results using the Large- Scale\nPlasma (LSP) code that explore intense mid-IR laser interactions with dense\ntargets. We present the results of thirty PIC simulations over a wide range of\nintensities (0.03 < $a_0$ < 39) and wavelengths ({\\lambda} =780 nm, 3 {\\mu}m,\nand 10 {\\mu}m). Earlier studies, limited to {\\lambda} =780 nm and $a_0 \\sim$ 1\n[1, 2], identified super-ponderomotive electron acceleration in the laser\nspecular direction for normal- incidence laser interactions with dense targets.\nWe extend this research to mid-IR wavelengths and find a more general result\nthat normal-incidence super-ponderomotive electron acceleration occurs provided\nthat the laser intensity is not highly relativistic ($a_0 \\lesssim 1$) and that\nthe pre-plasma scale length is similar to or longer than the laser wavelength.\nUnder these conditions, ejected electron angular and energy distributions are\nsimilar to expectations from an analytic model used in [2]. We also find that,\nfor $a_0 \\sim 1$, the mid-IR simulations exhibit a classic ponderomotive\nsteepening pattern with multiple peaks in the ion and electron density\ndistribution. Experimental validation of this basic laser-plasma interaction\nprocess will be possible in the near future using mid-IR laser technology and\ninterferometry.\n", "  The natural supersymmetry (SUSY) requires light stop quarks, light sbottom\nquark, and gluino to be around one TeV or lighter. The first generation squarks\ncan be effectively large which does not introduce any hierarchy problem in\norder to escape the constraints from LHC. In this paper we consider a Yukawa\ndeflect medation to realize the effective natural supersymmetry where the\ninteraction between squarks and messenger are made natural under certain\nFrogget-Nelson $U(1)_X$ charge. The first generation squarks obtain large and\npostive contribution from the yukawa deflect mediation. The corresponding\nphenomenology as well as sparticle spectrum are discussed in detail.\n", "  We examine the olfactory discrimination of left- and right-handed enantiomers\nof chiral odorants based on the odorant-mediated electron transport from a\ndonor to an acceptor of the olfactory receptors embodied in a biological\nenvironment. The chiral odorant is effectively described by an asymmetric\ndouble-well potential whose minima are associated to the left- and right-handed\nenantiomers. The introduced asymmetry is considered as an overall measure of\nchiral interactions. The biological environment is conveniently modeled as a\nbath of harmonic oscillators. The resulting Spin-Boson model is adapted by a\npolaron transformation to derive the corresponding Born-Markov master equation\nwith which we obtain the elastic and inelastic electron tunneling rates. We\nshow that the inelastic tunneling through left- and right-handed enantiomers\noccurs with different rates. The discrimination mechanism depends on the ratio\nof tunneling frequency to localization frequency.\n", "  In this contribution, we extend our framework for analyzing and visualizing\ncorrelated many-electron dynamics to non-variational, highly scalable\nelectronic structure method. Specifically, an explicitly time-dependent\nelectronic wave packet is written as a linear combination of $N$-electron wave\nfunctions at the configuration interaction singles (CIS) level, which are\nobtained from a reference time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)\ncalculation. The procedure is implemented in the open-source Python program\ndetCI@ORBKIT, which extends the capabilities of our recently published\npost-processing toolbox [J. Comput. Chem. 37 (2016) 1511]. From the output of\nstandard quantum chemistry packages using atom-centered Gaussian-type basis\nfunctions, the framework exploits the multi-determinental structure of the\nhybrid TDDFT/CIS wave packet to compute fundamental one-electron quantities\nsuch as difference electronic densities, transient electronic flux densities,\nand transition dipole moments. The hybrid scheme is benchmarked against wave\nfunction data for the laser-driven state selective excitation in LiH. It is\nshown that all features of the electron dynamics are in good quantitative\nagreement with the higher-level method provided a judicious choice of\nfunctional is made. Broadband excitation of a medium-sized organic chromophore\nfurther demonstrates the scalability of the method. In addition, the\ntime-dependent flux densities unravel the mechanistic details of the simulated\ncharge migration process at a glance.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the maximal violations of the CHSH inequality\nand V$\\grave{e}$rtesi's inequality under the local filtering operations. An\nanalytical method has been presented for general two-qubit systems to compute\nthe maximal violation of the CHSH inequality and the lower bound of the maximal\nviolation of V$\\acute{e}$rtesi's inequality over the local filtering\noperations. We show by examples that there exist quantum states whose\nnon-locality can be revealed after local filtering operation by the\nV$\\acute{e}$rtesi's inequality instead of the CHSH inequality.\n", "  Many focal-reducer spectrographs, currently available at state-of-the art\ntelescopes facilities, would benefit from a simple refurbishing that could\nincrease both the resolution and spectral range in order to cope with the\nprogressively challenging scientific requirements but, in order to make this\nupdate appealing, it should minimize the changes in the existing structure of\nthe instrument. In the past, many authors proposed solutions based on stacking\nsubsequently layers of dispersive elements and record multiple spectra in one\nshot (multiplexing). Although this idea is promising, it brings several\ndrawbacks and complexities that prevent the straightforward integration of a\nsuch device in a spectrograph. Fortunately nowadays, the situation has changed\ndramatically thanks to the successful experience achieved through\nphotopolymeric holographic films, used to fabricate common Volume Phase\nHolographic Gratings (VPHGs). Thanks to the various advantages made available\nby these materials in this context, we propose an innovative solution to design\na stacked multiplexed VPHGs that is able to secure efficiently different\nspectra in a single shot. This allows to increase resolution and spectral range\nenabling astronomers to greatly economize their awarded time at the telescope.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of our solution, both in terms\nof expected performance and feasibility, supposing the upgrade of the Gran\nTelescopio CANARIAS (GTC) Optical System for Imaging and\nlow-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS).\n", "  We report on a quantum electrodynamic (QED) investigation of the interaction\nbetween a ground state atom with another atom in an excited state. General\nexpressions, applicable to any atom, are indicated for the long-range tails\nwhich are due to virtual resonant emission and absorption into and from vacuum\nmodes whose frequency equals the transition frequency to available lower-lying\natomic states. For identical atoms, one of which is in an excited state, we\nalso discuss the mixing term which depends on the symmetry of the two-atom wave\nfunction (these evolve into either the gerade or the ungerade state for close\napproach), and we include all nonresonant states in our rigorous QED treatment.\nIn order to illustrate the findings, we analyze the fine-structure resolved van\nder Waals interaction for nD-1S hydrogen interactions with n=8,10,12 and find\nsurprisingly large numerical coefficients.\n", "  We look for unifying aspects behind superconductivity in aromatic hydrocarbon\nand fullerene family K$_3$X (X: picene, .. p-terphenyl, .. C$_{60}$). Aromatic\nhydrocarbon molecules support RVB states. Consequent stability (aromaticity)\nmakes them reluctant electron acceptors. We argue that X accepts only two (not\nall three) electrons from K$_3$ and creates charged RVB's in X$^{2-}$, and\nbecomes a (molecular) Cooper pair box. A weak Josephson coupling between\nX$^{2-}$ molecules creates a Bose Mott insulator, a potential high Tc\nsuperconductor. Remaining lone electron in the complex (K$_3)^{2+}$ occupies a\nsuitable metal orbital hybrid. They hybridize weakly through X$^{2-}$ molecular\nbridges, to form a half filled band of renormalized K atom orbitals, a\nFermionic Mott insulator. An interplay of RVB physics and charge transfer\n(mutual doping) or external doping leads to superconductivity in one or both\nMott insulators. In our theory there is room for room temperature\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Fermilab is committed to upgrade its accelerator complex to support HEP\nexperiments at the intensity frontier. The ongoing Proton Improvement Plan\n(PIP) enables us to reach 700 kW beam power on the NuMI neutrino targets. By\nthe end of the next decade, the current 400 MeV normal conducting LINAC will be\nreplaced by an 800 MeV superconducting LINAC (PIP-II) with an increased beam\npower >50% of the PIP design goal. Both in PIP and PIP-II era, the existing\nBooster is going to play a very significant role, at least for next two\ndecades. In the meanwhile, we have recently developed an innovative beam\ninjection and bunching scheme for the Booster called \"early injection scheme\"\nthat continues to use the existing 400 MeV LINAC and implemented into\noperation. This scheme has the potential to increase the Booster beam intensity\nby >40% from the PIP design goal. Some benefits from the scheme have already\nbeen seen. In this paper, I will describe the basic principle of the scheme,\nresults from recent beam experiments, our experience with the new scheme in\noperation, current status, issues and future plans. This scheme fits well with\nthe current and future intensity upgrade programs at Fermilab.\n", "  In line with its terms of reference the ICFA Neutrino Panel has developed a\nroadmapfor the international, accelerator-based neutrino programme. A \"roadmap\ndiscussion document\" was presented in May 2016 taking into account the\npeer-group-consultation described in the Panel's initial report. The \"roadmap\ndiscussion document\" was used to solicit feedback from the neutrino\ncommunity---and more broadly, the particle- and astroparticle-physics\ncommunities---and the various stakeholders in the programme. The roadmap, the\nconclusions and recommendations presented in this document take into account\nthe comments received following the publication of the roadmap discussion\ndocument.\n  With its roadmap the Panel documents the approved objectives and milestones\nof the experiments that are presently in operation or under construction.\nApproval, construction and exploitation milestones are presented for\nexperiments that are being considered for approval. The timetable proposed by\nthe proponents is presented for experiments that are not yet being considered\nformally for approval. Based on this information, the evolution of the\nprecision with which the critical parameters governinger the neutrino are known\nhas been evaluated. Branch or decision points have been identified based on the\nanticipated evolution in precision. The branch or decision points have in turn\nbeen used to identify desirable timelines for the neutrino-nucleus cross\nsection and hadro-production measurements that are required to maximise the\nintegrated scientific output of the programme. The branch points have also been\nused to identify the timeline for the R&D required to take the programme beyond\nthe horizon of the next generation of experiments. The theory and phenomenology\nprogramme, including nuclear theory, required to ensure that maximum benefit is\nderived from the experimental programme is also discussed.\n", "  Topological solitons are knots in continuous physical fields classified by\nnon-zero Hopf index values. Despite arising in theories that span many branches\nof physics, from elementary particles to condensed matter and cosmology, they\nremain experimentally elusive and poorly understood. We introduce a method of\nexperimental and numerical analysis of such localized structures in liquid\ncrystals that, similar to the mathematical Hopf maps, relates all points of the\nmedium's order parameter space to their closed-loop preimages within the\nthree-dimensional solitons. We uncover a surprisingly large diversity of\nnaturally occurring and laser-generated topologically nontrivial solitons with\ndifferently knotted nematic fields, which previously have not been realized in\ntheories and experiments alike. We discuss the implications of the liquid\ncrystal's non-polar nature on the knot soliton topology and how the medium's\nchirality, confinement and elastic anisotropy help to overcome the constrains\nof the Hobart-Derrick theorem, yielding static three-dimensional solitons\nwithout or with additional defects. Our findings will establish chiral nematics\nas a model system for experimental exploration of topological solitons and may\nimpinge on understanding of such nonsingular field configurations in other\nbranches of physics, as well as may lead to technological applications\n", "  We investigate the swelling dynamics driven by solvent absorption in a\nhydrogel sphere immersed in a solvent bath, through an accurate computational\nmodel and numerical study. We extensively describe the transient process from\ndry to wet and discuss the onset of surface instabilities through a measure of\nthe lack of smoothness of the outer surface and a morphological pattern of that\nsurface with respect to the two material parameters driving the swelling\ndynamics.\n", "  We propose an optical scheme to build an entangled network composed of $W$\nstate based on polarization encoded qubits (photons). This new setup consists\nof 2 $cNOT$ gates, 4 $V$ gates, 2 $Hadamard$ gates and basic optical tools such\nas polarizing beamsplitters ($PBS$s) and path couplers ($PC$s). $V$ gate is a\nspecially-designed tool acting as a two-qubit gate which is composed of a\n$cNOT$ gate, 3 $PBS$s and a $PC$. By using this gate, one benefits from the\ntemporarily generated optical degree of freedom, which is the spatial mode of a\nphoton in the proposed scheme. Using an extra degree of freedom allows us to\nperform more capable processing for $W$-state creation protocols. We use four\nphotons as input, which means we do not need entanglement as a resource. Also,\nwe show that the proposed scheme can be implemented by operating the quantum\noptical gates which can be realized via current photonics technology.\n", "  Organic material in anoxic sediment represents a globally significant carbon\nreservoir that acts to stabilize Earth's atmospheric composition. The dynamics\nby which microbes organize to consume this material remain poorly understood.\nHere we observe the collective dynamics of a microbial community, collected\nfrom a salt marsh, as it comes to steady state in a two-dimensional ecosystem,\ncovered by flowing water and under constant illumination. Microbes form a very\nthin front at the oxic-anoxic interface that moves towards the surface with\nconstant velocity and comes to rest at a fixed depth. Fronts are stable to all\nperturbations while in the sediment, but develop bioconvective plumes in water.\nWe observe the transient formation of parallel fronts. We model these dynamics\nto understand how they arise from the coupling between metabolism, aerotaxis,\nand diffusion. These results identify the typical timescale for the oxygen flux\nand penetration depth to reach steady state.\n", "  The temperature-dependent evolution of the Kondo lattice is a long-standing\ntopic of theoretical and experimental investigation and yet it lacks a truly\nmicroscopic description of the relation of the basic $f$-$d$ hybridization\nprocesses to the fundamental temperature scales of Kondo screening and\nFermi-liquid lattice coherence. Here, the temperature-dependence of $f$-$d$\nhybridized band dispersions and Fermi-energy $f$ spectral weight in the Kondo\nlattice system CeCoIn$_5$ is investigated using $f$-resonant angle-resolved\nphotoemission (ARPES) with sufficient detail to allow direct comparison to\nfirst principles dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) calculations containing\nfull realism of crystalline electric field states. The ARPES results, for two\northogonal (001) and (100) cleaved surfaces and three different $f$-$d$\nhybridization scenarios, with additional microscopic insight provided by DMFT,\nreveal $f$ participation in the Fermi surface at temperatures much higher than\nthe lattice coherence temperature, $T^*\\approx$ 45 K, commonly believed to be\nthe onset for such behavior. The identification of a $T$-dependent crystalline\nelectric field degeneracy crossover in the DMFT theory $below$ $T^*$ is\nspecifically highlighted.\n", "  We compute numerically eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in a\nthree-dimensional hyperbolic space. Applying the results to cosmology, we\ndemonstrate that the methods learned in quantum chaos can be used in other\nfields of research.\n", "  We investigate the numerical computation of Maass cusp forms for the modular\ngroup corresponding to large eigenvalues. We present Fourier coefficients of\ntwo cusp forms whose eigenvalues exceed r=40000. These eigenvalues are the\nlargest that have so far been found in the case of the modular group. They are\nlarger than the 130millionth eigenvalue.\n"]}
