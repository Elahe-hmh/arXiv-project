It works by correlating the principal components of a\nmatrix representation of the tracer dynamics with a series of sparse\nmeasurements. The method is tested on the 500 K isentropic surface using a\nsimulated tracer and with ozone measurements from the Polar Aerosol and Ozone\nMeasurement (POAM) III satellite instrument. The Lyapunov spectrum is measured\nand used to quantify the lifetime of each principal component. Using a 60 day\nlead time and five (5) principal components, cross validation of the\nreconstructed ozone and comparison with ozone sondes return root-mean-square\nerrors of 0.20 ppmv and 0.47 ppmv, respectively.\n", "  We examine in detail the relative equilibria in the four-vortex problem where\ntwo pairs of vortices have equal strength, that is, \\Gamma_1 = \\Gamma_2 = 1 and\n\\Gamma_3 = \\Gamma_4 = m where m is a nonzero real parameter. One main result is\nthat for m > 0, the convex configurations all contain a line of symmetry,\nforming a rhombus or an isosceles trapezoid. The rhombus solutions exist for\nall m but the isosceles trapezoid case exists only when m is positive. In fact,\nthere exist asymmetric convex configurations when m < 0. In contrast to the\nNewtonian four-body problem with two equal pairs of masses, where the symmetry\nof all convex central configurations is unproven, the equations in the vortex\ncase are easier to handle, allowing for a complete classification of all\nsolutions. Precise counts on the number and type of solutions (equivalence\nclasses) for different values of m, as well as a description of some of the\nbifurcations that occur, are provided. Our techniques involve a combination of\nanalysis and modern and computational algebraic geometry.\n", "  We explore the interplay between tunneling process and chiral interactions in\nthe discrimination of chiral states for an ensemble of molecules in a\nbiological environment. Each molecule is described by an asymmetric double-well\npotential and the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic oscillators. We\ncarefully analyze different time-scales appearing in the resulting master\nequation at both weak- and strong-coupling limits. The corresponding results\nare accompanied by a set of coupled differential equations characterizing\noptical activity of the molecules. We show that, at the weak-coupling limit,\nchiral interactions prohibit the coherent racemization induced by decoherence\neffects and thus preserve the initial chiral state. At the strong-coupling\nlimit, considering the memory effects of the environment, Markovian behavior is\nobserved at long times.\n", "  Propagation of the strong shock in the flat expanding Friedman universe is\ninvestigated using methods of dimension and similarity. Exact analytic solution\nof self-similar equations is obtained, determining dependences of the radius\nand velocity of the shock wave on time and radius. It is obtained, that in the\nexpanding medium the velocity of shock decreases as $\\sim t^{-1/5}$, what is\nslower than the shock velocity in the static uniform medium $\\sim t^{-3/5}$.\nThe radius of the shock wave in the expanding self-gravitating medium increases\n$\\sim t^{4/5}$, more rapidly than the shock wave radius in the uniform\nnon-gravitating medium $\\sim t^{2/5}$. So, the shock propagates in the\ndirection of decreasing density with larger speed, that in the static medium,\ndue to accelerating action of the decreasing density, even in the presence of a\nself-gravitation.\n", "  We consider the generalized Anderson Model\n$\\Delta+\\sum_{n\\in\\mathcal{N}}\\omega_n P_n$, where $\\mathcal{N}$ is a countable\nset, $\\{\\omega_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathcal{N}}$ are i.i.d random variables and $P_n$ are\nrank $N<\\infty$ projections. For these models we prove theorem analogous to\nthat of Jak\\v{s}i\\'{c}-Last on the equivalence of the trace measure\n$\\sigma_n(\\cdot)=tr(P_nE_{H^\\omega}(\\cdot)P_n)$ for $n\\in\\mathcal{N}$ a.e\n$\\omega$. Our model covers the dimer and polymer models.\n", "  An action of general form is proposed for a Universe containing matter,\nradiation and dark energy. The latter is interpreted as a tachyon field\nnon-minimally coupled to the scalar curvature. The Palatini approach is used\nwhen varying the action so the connection is given by a more generic form. Both\nthe self-interaction potential and the non-minimally coupling function are\nobtained by constraining the system to present invariability under global point\ntransformation of the fields (Noether Symmetry). The only possible solution is\nshown to be that of minimal coupling and constant potential (Chaplygin gas).\nThe behavior of the dynamical properties of the system is compared to recent\nobservational data, which infers that the tachyon field must indeed be\ndynamical.\n", "  We investigate the structures of $^{9,10}$Be and $^{10}$B with the\ntensor-optimized shell model (TOSM) using the effective interaction based on\nthe bare nucleon-nucleon interaction AV8$^\\prime$. The tensor correlation is\ntreated in TOSM with the full optimization of 2p2h configurations including\nhigh-momentum components. The short-range correlation is described in the\nunitary correlation operator method (UCOM). It is found that the level orders\nof the low-lying states of $^{9,10}$Be and $^{10}$B are entirely reproduced.\nFor $^9$Be, ground band states are located relatively in higher energy than the\nexperiments, which indicates the missing $\\alpha$ clustering correlation in\nthese states as seen in the case of $^8$Be with TOSM. In addition, the tensor\nforce gives the larger attraction for $T$=1/2 states than for $T$=3/2 ones for\n$^9$Be. For $^{10}$Be, the tensor contribution of $0^+_2$ shows the largest\nvalue among the $0^+$ states. This can be related to the $\\alpha$ clustering\ncorrelation in this state. It is also found that the level order of three\nnuclei depends on the tensor force in comparison with the results obtained with\nthe Minnesota interaction without the tensor force.\n", "  Transition from steady to oscillatory buoyancy convection of air in a\nlaterally heated cubic box is studied numerically by straight-forward time\nintegration of Boussinesq equations using a series of gradually refined finite\nvolume grids. Horizontal and spanwise cube boundaries are assumed to be either\nperfectly thermally conducting or perfectly thermally insulated, which results\nin four different sets of thermal boundary conditions. Critical Grashof numbers\nare obtained by interpolation of numerically extracted growth/decay rates of\noscillations amplitude to zero. Slightly supercritical flow regimes are\ndescribed by time-averaged flows, snapshots, and spatial distribution of\noscillations amplitude. Possible similarities and dissimilarities with\ntwo-dimensional instabilities in laterally heated square cavities are\ndiscussed. Break of symmetries and sub- or super-critical character of\nbifurcations are examined. Three consequent transitions from steady to\noscillatory regime, from oscillatory to steady, and finally to oscillatory\nflow, are found in the case of perfectly insulated horizontal and spanwise\nboundaries. Arguments for grid and time step independence of the results are\ngiven.\n", "  The cosmological dark matter field is not completely described by its\nhierarchy of $N$-point functions, a non-perturbative effect with the\nconsequence that only part of the theory can be probed with the hierarchy. We\ngive here an exact characterization of the joint information of the full set of\n$N$-point correlators of the lognormal field. The lognormal field is the\narchetypal example of a field where this effect occurs, and, at the same time,\none of the few tractable and insightful available models to specify fully the\nstatistical properties of the evolved matter density field beyond the\nperturbative regime. Nonlinear growth in the Universe in that model is set\nletting the log-density field probability density functional evolve keeping its\nGaussian shape, according to the diffusion equation in Euclidean space. We show\nthat the hierarchy probes a different evolution equation, the diffusion\nequation defined not in Euclidean space but on the compact torus, with\nuniformity as the long-term solution. The extraction of the hierarchy of\ncorrelators can be recast in the form of a nonlinear transformation applied to\nthe field, 'wrapping', undergoing a sharp transition towards complete disorder\nin the deeply nonlinear regime, where all memory of the initial conditions is\nlost.\n", "  It has been proposed that neural noise in the cortex arises from chaotic\ndynamics in the balanced state: in this model of cortical dynamics, the\nexcitatory and inhibitory inputs to each neuron approximately cancel, and\nactivity is driven by fluctuations of the synaptic inputs around their mean. It\nremains unclear whether neural networks in the balanced state can perform tasks\nthat are highly sensitive to noise, such as storage of continuous parameters in\nworking memory, while also accounting for the irregular behavior of single\nneurons. Here we show that continuous parameter working memory can be\nmaintained in the balanced state, in a neural circuit with a simple network\narchitecture. We show analytically that in the limit of an infinite network,\nthe dynamics generated by this architecture are characterized by a continuous\nset of steady balanced states, allowing for the indefinite storage of a\ncontinuous parameter. In finite networks, we show that the chaotic noise drives\ndiffusive motion along the approximate attractor, which gradually degrades the\nstored memory. We analyze the dynamics and show that the slow diffusive motion\ninduces slowly decaying temporal cross correlations in the activity, which\ndiffer substantially from those previously described in the balanced state. We\ncalculate the diffusivity, and show that it is inversely proportional to the\nsystem size. For large enough (but realistic) neural population sizes, and with\nsuitable tuning of the network connections, the proposed balanced network can\nsustain continuous parameter values in memory over time scales larger by\nseveral orders of magnitude than the single neuron time scale.\n", "  We theoretically studied the quasiparticle transport in a 2D electron gas\nbiased in the quantum Hall regime and in the presence of a lateral potential\nbarrier. The lateral junction hosts the specific magnetic field dependent\nquasiparticle states highly localized in the transverse direction. The quantum\ntunnelling across the barrier provides a complex bands structure of a\none-dimensional energy spectrum of these bound states, $\\epsilon_n(p_y)$, where\n$p_y$ is the electron momentum in the longitudinal direction $y$. Such a\nspectrum manifests itself by a large number of peaks and drops in the\ndependence of the magnetic edge states transmission coefficient $D(E)$ on the\nelectron energy $E$. E.g., the high value of $D$ occurs as soon as the electron\nenergy $E$ reaches gaps in the spectrum. These peaks and drops of $D(E)$ result\nin giant oscillations of the transverse conductance $G_x$ with the magnetic\nfield and/or the transport voltage. Our theoretical analysis based on the\ncoherent macroscopic quantum superposition of the bound states and the magnetic\nedge states propagating along the system boundaries, is in a good accord with\nthe experimental observations found in Ref. W. Kang et al., Letters to Nature,\n403, 59 (2000).\n", "  While a rich variety of self-propelled particle models propose to explain the\ncollective motion of fish and other animals, rigorous statistical comparison\nbetween models and data remains a challenge. Plausible models should be\nflexible enough to capture changes in the collective behaviour of animal groups\nat their different developmental stages and group sizes. Here we analyse the\nstatistical properties of schooling fish (Pseudomugil signifer) through a\ncombination of experiments and simulations. We make novel use of a Boltzmann\ninversion method, usually applied in molecular dynamics, to identify the\neffective potential of the mean force of fish interactions. Specifically, we\nshow that larger fish have a larger repulsion zone, but stronger attraction,\nresulting in greater alignment in their collective motion. We model the\ncollective dynamics of schools using a self-propelled particle model, modified\nto include varying particle speed and a local repulsion rule. We demonstrate\nthat the statistical properties of the fish schools are reproduced by our\nmodel, thereby capturing a number of features of the behaviour and development\nof schooling fish.\n", "  We examine the locality assumption of Bell's theorem in three steps of EPRB\nexperiment. Depending on the context, locality is embodied in the conditions of\nseparability, local causality, factorizability, relativistic causality, and\nnon-contextuality. We show that separability, characterized by the constraint\nof zero covariance, is equivalent to local causality which leads to\nfactorizability through the measurement process. Factorizability is the\nconjunction of parameter independence and outcome independence. It is commonly\nbelieved that relativistic causality is equivalent to parameter independence,\nwhich is satisfied by quantum mechanics. According to our approach, however,\nthis is unjustified due to the second step analysis of EPRB experiment,\nincluding the measurement on the first particle. We define non-contextuality\nbased on preparation procedure and measurement process. Preparation-based\nnon-contextuality is an independent assumption, but non-locality within the\nframework of a separable model can be interpreted as measurement-based\ncontextuality. Finally, we show that any fundamental theory consistent with\nquantum mechanics, should refute outcome independence in its framework of\ndescription.\n", "  We develop a new formalism to treat nuclear many-body systems using bare\nnucleon-nucleon interaction. It has become evident that the tensor interaction\nplays important role in nuclear many-body systems due to the role of the pion\nin strongly interacting system. We take the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics\n(AMD) as a basic framework and add a tensor correlation operator acting on the\nAMD wave function using the concept of the tensor-optimized shell model (TOSM).\nWe demonstrate a systematical and straightforward formulation utilizing the\nGaussian integration and differentiation method and the antisymmetrization\ntechnique to calculate all the matrix elements of the many-body Hamiltonian. We\ncan include the three-body interaction naturally and calculate the matrix\nelements systematically in the progressive order of the tensor correlation\noperator. We call the new formalism \"tensor-optimized antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics\".\n", "  The classical ground state magnetic response of fullerene molecules that\nresemble capped carbon nanotubes is calculated within the framework of the\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. It is found that the magnetic response\ndepends subtly on spatial symmetry and chirality. Clusters based on armchair\ncarbon nanotubes which are capped with non-neighboring pentagons and have D5d\nspatial symmetry have a number of magnetization discontinuities which increases\nwith their size. This occurs even though the model completely lacks magnetic\nanisotropy, and even though the only source of frustration are the two groups\nof six pentagons located at the ends of the molecules, which become more\nstrongly outnumbered as the clusters are filled in the middle with more\nunfrustrated hexagons with increasing size. For the cluster with 180 vertices\nthere are already seven magnetization and one susceptibility discontinuities.\nContrary to that, similar molecules which have D5h spatial symmetry reach a\nlimit of one magnetization and two susceptibility ground state discontinuities,\nwhile fullerene molecules based on zigzag carbon nanotubes and capped by\nneighboring pentagons also reach a fixed number of discontinuities with\nincreasing size.\n", "  Recent consensus on the $N_f=2+1$ equation of state at vanishing chemical\npotential from different lattice-QCD groups has spoiled the previous agreement\nwith the outcome from the mean-field Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In this\nletter we review the thermodynamics of the PNJL model introducing two important\naspects needed to describe the pressure computed in the lattice QCD. First, we\nconsider the thermodynamics of the model beyond the mean-field approach to\ninclude pseudoscalar and scalar mesonic-like fluctuations into the\ngrand-canonical potential. This accounts for the hadronic pressure of the\nsystem below the critical temperature. On the other hand we also implement the\nback reaction of quarks into the Polyakov-loop effective potential bringing a\nreduction of the pressure above $T_c$ from the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. We get a\ngood agreement with lattice-QCD data at low and moderate temperatures, opening\nthe door to a straightforward extension to finite chemical potential.\n", "  We investigate a spatially discrete surrogate model for the dynamics of a\nslender, elastic, inextensible fiber in turbulent flows. Deduced from a\ncontinuous space-time beam model for which no solution theory is available, it\nconsists of a high-dimensional second order stochastic differential equation in\ntime with a nonlinear algebraic constraint and an associated Lagrange\nmultiplier term. We establish a suitable framework for the rigorous formulation\nand analysis of the semi-discrete model and prove existence and uniqueness of a\nglobal strong solution. The proof is based on an explicit representation of the\nLagrange multiplier and on the observation that the obtained explicit drift\nterm in the equation satisfies a one-sided linear growth condition on the\nconstraint manifold. The theoretical analysis is complemented by numerical\nstudies concerning the time discretization of our model. The performance of\nimplicit Euler-type methods can be improved when using the explicit\nrepresentation of the Lagrange multiplier to compute refined initial estimates\nfor the Newton method applied in each time step.\n", "  The differential multiplicity of dileptons in a hot and magnetized\nquark-gluon plasma, $\\Delta_{B}\\equiv dN_{B}/d^{4}xd^{4}q$, is derived from\nfirst principles. The constant magnetic field $B$ is assumed to be aligned in a\nfixed spatial direction. It is shown that the anisotropy induced by the $B$\nfield is mainly reflected in the general structure of photon spectral density\nfunction. This is related to the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization\ntensor, $\\mbox{Im}[\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}]$, which is derived in a first order\nperturbative approximation. As expected, the final analytical expression for\n$\\Delta_{B}$ includes a trace over the product of a photonic part,\n$\\mbox{Im}[\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}]$, and a leptonic part, ${\\cal{L}}_{\\mu\\nu}$. It is\nshown that $\\Delta_{B}$ consists of two parts, $\\Delta_{B}^{\\|}$ and\n$\\Delta_{B}^{\\perp}$, arising from the components $(\\mu,\\nu)=(\\|,\\|)$ and\n$(\\mu,\\nu)=(\\perp,\\perp)$ of $\\mbox{Im}[\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}]$ and\n${\\cal{L}}_{\\mu\\nu}$. Here, the transverse and longitudinal directions are\ndefined with respect to the direction of the $B$ field. Combining\n$\\Delta_{B}^{\\|}$ and $\\Delta_{B}^{\\perp}$, a novel anisotropy factor $\\nu_{B}$\nis introduced. Using the final analytical expression of $\\Delta_{B}$, the\npossible interplay between the temperature $T$ and the magnetic field strength\n$eB$ on the ratio $\\Delta_{B}/\\Delta_{0}$ and $\\nu_{B}$ is numerically studied.\nHere, $\\Delta_{0}$ is the Born approximated dilepton multiplicity in the\nabsence of external magnetic fields. It is, in particular, shown that for each\nfixed $T$ and $B$, in the vicinity of certain threshold energies,\n$\\Delta_{B}\\gg \\Delta_{0}$ and $\\Delta_{B}^{\\perp}\\gg \\Delta_{B}^{\\|}$. The\nlatter anisotropy may be interpreted as one of the microscopic sources of the\nmacroscopic anisotropies, reflecting themselves, e.g., in the elliptic\nasymmetry factor $v_{2}$ of dileptons.\n", "  We present a mathematical study of two-dimensional electrostatic and\nelectromagnetic shielding by a cage of conducting wires (the so-called `Faraday\ncage effect'). Taking the limit as the number of wires in the cage tends to\ninfinity we use the asymptotic method of multiple scales to derive continuum\nmodels for the shielding, involving homogenized boundary conditions on an\neffective cage boundary. We show how the resulting models depend on key cage\nparameters such as the size and shape of the wires, and, in the electromagnetic\ncase, on the frequency and polarisation of the incident field. In the\nelectromagnetic case there are resonance effects, whereby at frequencies close\nto the natural frequencies of the equivalent solid shell, the presence of the\ncage actually amplifies the incident field, rather than shielding it. By\nappropriately modifying the continuum model we calculate the modified resonant\nfrequencies, and their associated peak amplitudes. We discuss applications to\nradiation containment in microwave ovens and acoustic scattering by perforated\nshells.\n", "  We study universal quantum codes for entanglement-assisted quantum\ncommunication over compound quantum channels. In this setting, sender and\nreceiver do not know the specific channel that will be used for communication,\nbut only know the set that the channel is selected from. We investigate\ndifferent variations of the problem: uninformed users, informed receiver,\ninformed sender, and feedback assistance. We derive single-letter formulas for\nall corresponding channel capacities. Our proofs are based on one-shot\ndecoupling bounds and properties of smooth entropies.\n", "  The study of protein mass transport via atomistic simulation requires time\nand length scales beyond the computational capabilities of modern computer\nsystems. The raspberry model for colloidal particles in combination with the\nmesoscopic hydrodynamic method of lattice Boltzmann facilitates coarse-grained\nsimulations that are on the order of microseconds and hundreds of nanometers\nfor the study of diffusive transport of protein-like colloid particles. The\nraspberry model reproduces linearity in resistance to motion versus particle\nsize and correct enhanced drag within cylindrical pores at off-center\ncoordinates for spherical particles. Owing to the high aspect ratio of many\nproteins, ellipsoidal raspberry colloid particles were constructed and\nreproduced the geometric resistance factors of Perrin and of Happel and Brenner\nin the laboratory-frame and in the moving body-frame. Accurate body-frame\nrotations during diffusive motion have been captured for the first time using\nprojections of displacements.\n", "  The Askaryan effect describes coherent electromagnetic radiation from\nhigh-energy cascades in dense media with a collective charge. We present an\nanalytic model of Askaryan radiation that accounts simultaneously for the\nthree- dimensional form factor of the cascade, and quantum mechanical cascade\nelongation via the Landau-Pomeranchuk- Migdal effect. These calculations, and\nthe associated open-source code, allow the user to avoid computationally\nintensive Monte Carlo cascade simulations. Searches for cosmogenic neutrinos in\nAskaryan-based detectors benefit from computational speed, because scans of\nAskaryan parameter-space are required to match neutrino signals. The Askaryan\nfield is derived from cascade equations verified with Geant4 simulations, and\ncompared with prior numerical and semi-analytic calculations. Finally,\ninstructive cases of the model are transformed from the Fourier domain to the\ntime-domain. Next-generation in situ detectors like ARA and ARIANNA can use\nanalytic time- domain signal models to search for correlations with event\ncandidates.\n", "  The family of organic-inorganic tri-halide perovskites including MA\n(MethylAmmonium)PbI$_{3}$, MAPbI$_{3-x}$Cl$_{x}$, FA (FormAmidinium)PbI$_{3}$\nand FAPbBr$_{3}$ are having a tremendous impact on the field of photovoltaic\ncells due to their ease of deposition and efficiencies, but device performance\ncan be significanly affected by inhomogeneities. Here we report a study of\ntemperature dependent micro-photoluminescence which shows a strong spatial\ninhomogeneity related to the presence of microcrystalline grains, which can be\nboth light and dark. In all of the tri-iodide based materials there is evidence\nthat the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition observed around 160K does\nnot occur uniformly across the sample with domain formation related to the\nunderlying microcrystallite grains, some of which remain in the high\ntemperature, tetragonal, phase even at very low temperatures. At low\ntemperature the tetragonal domains can be significantly influenced by local\ndefects in the layers. In FAPbBr$_{3}$ a more macroscopic domain structure is\nobserved with large numbers of grains forming phase correlated regions.\n", "  An intriguing open question is whether measurements made on Big Data\nrecording human activities can yield us high-fidelity proxies of socio-economic\ndevelopment and well-being. Can we monitor and predict the socio-economic\ndevelopment of a territory just by observing the behavior of its inhabitants\nthrough the lens of Big Data? In this paper, we design a data-driven analytical\nframework that uses mobility measures and social measures extracted from mobile\nphone data to estimate indicators for socio-economic development and\nwell-being. We discover that the diversity of mobility, defined in terms of\nentropy of the individual users' trajectories, exhibits (i) significant\ncorrelation with two different socio-economic indicators and (ii) the highest\nimportance in predictive models built to predict the socio-economic indicators.\nOur analytical framework opens an interesting perspective to study human\nbehavior through the lens of Big Data by means of new statistical indicators\nthat quantify and possibly \"nowcast\" the well-being and the socio-economic\ndevelopment of a territory.\n", "  We have analyzed the atomic and molecular gas using the 21 cm HI and 2.6/1.3\nmm CO emissions toward the young supernova remnant (SNR) RCW 86 in order to\nidentify the interstellar medium with which the shock waves of the SNR\ninteract. We have found an HI intensity depression in the velocity range\nbetween $-46$ and $-28$ km s$^{-1}$ toward the SNR, suggesting a cavity in the\ninterstellar medium. The HI cavity coincides with the thermal and non-thermal\nemitting X-ray shell. The thermal X-rays are coincident with the edge of the HI\ndistribution, which indicates a strong density gradient, while the non-thermal\nX-rays are found toward the less dense, inner part of the HI cavity. The most\nsignificant non-thermal X-rays are seen toward the southwestern part of the\nshell where the HI gas traces the dense and cold component. We also identified\nCO clouds which are likely interacting with the SNR shock waves in the same\nvelocity range as the HI, although the CO clouds are distributed only in a\nlimited part of the SNR shell. The most massive cloud is located in the\nsoutheastern part of the shell, showing detailed correspondence with the\nthermal X-rays. These CO clouds show an enhanced CO $J$ = 2-1/1-0 intensity\nratio, suggesting heating/compression by the shock front. We interpret that the\nshock-cloud interaction enhances non-thermal X-rays in the southwest and the\nthermal X-rays are emitted by the shock-heated gas of density 10-100 cm$^{-3}$.\nMoreover, we can clearly see an HI envelope around the CO cloud, suggesting\nthat the progenitor had a weaker wind than the massive progenitor of the\ncore-collapse SNR RX J1713.7$-$3949. It seems likely that the progenitor of RCW\n86 was a system consisting of a white dwarf and a low-mass star with\nlow-velocity accretion winds.\n", "  This work considers the rigorous derivation of continuum models of step\nmotion starting from a mesoscopic Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) type model\nfollowing the work [Xiang, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 2002]. We prove that as the\nlattice parameter goes to zero, for a finite time interval, a modified discrete\nmodel converges to the strong solution of the limiting PDE with first order\nconvergence rate.\n", "  In this paper we consider the dynamics of a massive spinor field in the\nbackground of the acoustic black hole spacetime. Although this effective metric\nis acoustic and describes the propagation of sound waves, it can be considered\nas a toy model for the gravitational black hole. In this manner, we study the\nproperties of the dynamics of the fermion field in this \"gravitational\"\nrotating black hole as well as the vortex background. We compute the\ndifferential cross section through the use of the partial wave approach and\nshow that an effect similar to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect occurs\nfor the massive fermion field moving in this effective metric. We discuss the\nlimiting cases and compare the results with the massless scalar field case.\n", "  The rates at which a user can generate device-independent quantum random\nnumbers from a Bell-type experiment depend on the measurements that he\nperforms. By numerically optimising over these measurements, we present lower\nbounds on the randomness generation rates for a family of two-qubit states\ncomposed from a mixture of partially entangled states and the completely mixed\nstate. We also report on the randomness generation rates from a tomographic\nmeasurement. Interestingly in this case, the randomness generation rates are\nnot monotonic functions of entanglement.\n", "  Interacting bosons or fermions give rise to some of the most fascinating\nphases of matter, including high-temperature superconductivity, the fractional\nquantum Hall effect, quantum spin liquids and Mott insulators. While these\nsystems are promising for technological applications, they also present\nconceptual challenges as they require approaches beyond mean-field and\nperturbation theory. Here we develop a general framework for identifying the\nfree theory that is closest to a given interacting model in terms of their\nground state correlations. Moreover, we quantify the distance between them\nusing the entanglement spectrum. When this interaction distance is small, the\noptimal free theory provides an effective description of the low energy physics\nof the interacting model. Our construction of the optimal free model is\nnon-perturbative in nature, thus it offers a new theoretical framework for\ninvestigating strongly correlated systems.\n", "  In this work, we report the fabrication of fully automated experimental setup\nfor high temperature Seebeck coefficient ({\\alpha}) measurement. The K-type\nthermocouples are used to measure the average temperature of the sample and\nSeebeck voltage across it. The temperature dependence of the Seebeck\ncoefficients of the thermocouple and its negative leg is taken care by using\nthe integration method. Steady state based differential technique is used for\n{\\alpha} measurement. Use of limited component and thin heater simplify the\nsample holder design and minimize the heat loss. The power supplied to the\nheater decides the temperature difference across the sample and the measurement\nis carried out by achieving the steady state. The LabVIEW based program is\nbuilt to automize the whole measurement process. The complete setup is\nfabricated by using commonly available materials in the market. This instrument\nis standardized for materials with a wide range of {\\alpha} and for the wide\nrange of {\\Delta}T across the specimen. For this purpose, high temperature\nmeasurement of {\\alpha} of iron, constantan, bismuth, and Bi_0.36 Sb_1.45 Te_3\nsamples are carried out and data obtained from these samples are found to be in\ngood agreement with the reported data.\n", "  Various theories of quantum gravity predict the existence of a minimum length\nscale, which implies the Planck-scale modifications of the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle to a so-called generalized uncertainty principle (GUP).\nPrevious studies of the GUP focused on its implications for high-energy\nphysics, cosmology, and astrophysics. Here, the application of the GUP to\nlow-energy quantum systems, and particularly cold atoms, is studied. Results\nfrom the $^{87}$Rb atom recoil experiment are used to set upper bounds on\nparameters in three different GUP proposals. A $10^{14}$-level bound on the\nAli-Das-Vagenas proposal is found, which is the second best bound so far. A\n$10^{26}$-level bound on Maggiore's proposal is obtained, which turns out to be\nthe best available bound on it.\n", "  In this work, we prove a bound on multiplicity of the singular spectrum for\ncertain class of Anderson Hamiltonians. The class of operator is\n$H^\\omega=\\Delta+\\sum_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^d}\\omega_n P_n$ on the Hilbert space\n$\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}^d)$, where $\\Delta$ is discrete laplacian, $P_n$ are\nprojection onto $\\ell^2(\\{x\\in\\mathbb{Z}^d:n_il_i<x_i\\leq (n_i+1)l_i\\})$ for\nsome $l_1,\\cdots,l_d\\in\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\{\\omega_n\\}_n$ are i.i.d real bounded\nrandom variables following absolutely continuous distribution. We prove that\nthe multiplicity of singular spectrum is bounded above by $2^d-d$ independent\nof $\\{l_i\\}_{i=1}^d$. When $l_i+1\\not\\in 2\\mathbb{N}\\cup3\\mathbb{N}$ for all\n$i$ and $gcd(l_i+1,l_j+1)=1$ for $i\\neq j$, we also prove that the singular\nspectrum is simple.\n", "  We show that local injection of pure spin current into an electrically\ndisconnected ferromagnetic - normal-metal sandwich induces electric currents,\nthat run along closed loops inside the device, and are powered by the source of\nthe spin injection. Such electric currents may significantly modify voltage\ndistribution in spin-injection devices and induce long-range tails of spin\naccumulation.\n", "  Multi-component generalizations of derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS)\ntype of equations having quadratic bundle Lax pairs related to Z_2-graded Lie\nalgebras and A.III symmetric spaces are studied. The Jost solutions and the\nminimal set of scattering data for the case of local and nonlocal reductions\nare constructed. The latter lead to multi-component integrable equations with\nCPT-symmetry. Furthermore, the fundamental analytic solutions (FAS) are\nconstructed and the spectral properties of the associated Lax operators are\nbriefly discussed. The Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) for the multi-component\ngeneralizations of DNLS equation of Kaup-Newell (KN) and Gerdjikov-Ivanov (GI)\ntypes is derived. A modification of the dressing method is presented allowing\nthe explicit derivation of the soliton solutions for the multi-component GI\nequation with both local and nonlocal reductions. It is shown that for specific\nchoices of the reduction these solutions can have regular behavior for all\nfinite x and t. The fundamental properties of the multi-component GI equations\nare briefly discussed at the end.\n", "  Amplification of quantum states is inevitably accompanied with the\nintroduction of noise at the output. For protocols that are probabilistic with\nheralded success, noiseless linear amplification in theory may still possible.\nWhen the protocol is successful, it can lead to an output that is a noiselessly\namplified copy of the input. When the protocol is unsuccessful, the output\nstate is degraded and is usually discarded. Probabilistic protocols may improve\nthe performance of some quantum information protocols, but not for metrology if\nthe whole statistics is taken into consideration. We calculate the precision\nlimits on estimating the phase of coherent states using a noiseless linear\namplifier by computing its quantum Fisher information and we show that on\naverage, the noiseless linear amplifier does not improve the phase estimate. We\nalso discuss the case where abstention from measurement can reduce the cost for\nestimation.\n", "  We introduce the pinning model on a quenched renewal, which is an instance of\na (strongly correlated) disordered pinning model. The potential takes value 1\nat the renewal times of a quenched realization of a renewal process $\\sigma$,\nand $0$ elsewhere, so nonzero potential values become sparse if the gaps in\n$\\sigma$ have infinite mean. The \"polymer\" -- of length $\\sigma_N$ -- is given\nby another renewal $\\tau$, whose law is modified by the Boltzmann weight\n$\\exp(\\beta\\sum_{n=1}^N \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\sigma_n\\in\\tau\\}})$. Our assumption is\nthat $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$ have gap distributions with power-law-decay exponents\n$1+\\alpha$ and $1+\\tilde \\alpha$ respectively, with $\\alpha\\geq 0,\\tilde\n\\alpha>0$. There is a localization phase transition: above a critical value\n$\\beta_c$ the free energy is positive, meaning that $\\tau$ is \\emph{pinned} on\nthe quenched renewal $\\sigma$. We consider the question of relevance of the\ndisorder, that is to know when $\\beta_c$ differs from its annealed counterpart\n$\\beta_c^{\\rm ann}$. We show that $\\beta_c=\\beta_c^{\\rm ann}$ whenever $\n\\alpha+\\tilde \\alpha \\geq 1$, and $\\beta_c=0$ if and only if the renewal\n$\\tau\\cap\\sigma$ is recurrent. On the other hand, we show $\\beta_c>\\beta_c^{\\rm\nann}$ when $ \\alpha+\\frac32\\, \\tilde \\alpha <1$. We give evidence that this\nshould in fact be true whenever $ \\alpha+\\tilde \\alpha<1$, providing examples\nfor all such $ \\alpha,\\tilde \\alpha$ of distributions of $\\tau,\\sigma$ for\nwhich $\\beta_c>\\beta_c^{\\rm ann}$. We additionally consider two natural\nvariants of the model: one in which the polymer and disorder are constrained to\nhave equal numbers of renewals ($\\sigma_N=\\tau_N$), and one in which the\npolymer length is $\\tau_N$ rather than $\\sigma_N$. In both cases we show the\ncritical point is the same as in the original model, at least when $ \\alpha>0$.\n", "  In this paper we report on the timing resolution of the first production of\n50 micro-meter thick Ultra-Fast Silicon Detectors (UFSD) as obtained in a beam\ntest with pions of 180 GeV/c momentum. UFSD are based on the Low-Gain Avalanche\nDetectors (LGAD) design, employing n-on-p silicon sensors with internal charge\nmultiplication due to the presence of a thin, low-resistivity diffusion layer\nbelow the junction. The UFSD used in this test belongs to the first production\nof thin (50 {\\mu}m) sensors, with an pad area of 1.4 mm2. The gain was measured\nto vary between 5 and 70 depending on the bias voltage. The experimental setup\nincluded three UFSD and a fast trigger consisting of a quartz bar readout by a\nSiPM. The timing resolution, determined comparing the time of arrival of the\nparticle in one or more UFSD and the trigger counter, for single UFSD was\nmeasured to be 35 ps for a bias voltage of 200 V, and 26 ps for a bias voltage\nof 240 V, and for the combination of 3 UFSD to be 20 ps for a bias voltage of\n200 V, and 15 ps for a bias voltage of 240 V.\n", "  In a Bell experiment two parties share a quantum state and perform local\nmeasurements on their subsystems separately, and the statistics of the\nmeasurement outcomes are recorded as a Bell correlation. For any Bell\ncorrelation, it turns out {that} a quantum state with minimal size that is able\nto produce this correlation can always be pure. In this work, we first exhibit\ntwo device-independent characterizations for the pure state that Alice and Bob\nshare using only the correlation data. Specifically, we give two conditions\nthat the Schmidt coefficients must satisfy, which can be tight, and have\nvarious applications in quantum tasks. First, one of the characterizations\nallows us to bound the entanglement between Alice and Bob using Renyi entropies\nand also to {bound} the underlying Hilbert space dimension. Second, when the\n{Hilbert space dimension bound} is tight, the shared pure quantum state has to\nbe maximally entangled. Third, the second characterization gives a sufficient\ncondition that a Bell correlation cannot be generated by particular quantum\nstates. We also show that our results can be generalized to the case of shared\nmixed states.\n", "  It is shown that the first biharmonic boundary value problem on a\ntopologically trivial domain in 3D is equivalent to three (consecutively to\nsolve) second-order problems. This decomposition result is based on a\nHelmholtz-like decomposition of an involved non-standard Sobolev space of\ntensor fields and a proper characterization of the operator div-Div acting on\nthis space. Similar results for biharmonic problems in 2D and their impact on\nthe construction and analysis of finite element methods have been recently\npublished by the second author. The discussion of the kernel of div-Div leads\nto (de Rham-like) closed and exact Hilbert complexes, the div-Div-complex and\nits adjoint the Grad-grad-complex, involving spaces of trace-free and symmetric\ntensor fields. For these tensor fields we show Helmholtz type decompositions\nand, most importantly, new compact embedding results. Almost all our results\nhold and are formulated for general bounded strong Lipschitz domains of\narbitrary topology. There is no reasonable doubt that our results extend to\nstrong Lipschitz domains in arbitrary dimensions.\n", "  We present analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times of\nnon-backtracking random walks on finite Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks of $N$\nnodes. The walkers hop randomly between adjacent nodes on the network, without\nstepping back to the previous node, until they hit a node which they have\nalready visited before or get trapped in a dead-end node. At this point, the\npath is terminated. The length, $d$, of the resulting path, is called the first\nhitting time. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical results for the\ntail distribution of first hitting times, $P(d>\\ell)$, $\\ell=0,1,2,\\dots$, of\nnon-backtracking random walks starting from a random initial node. It turns out\nthat the distribution $P(d>\\ell)$ is given by a product of a discrete Rayleigh\ndistribution and an exponential distribution. It is found that the paths of\nnon-backtracking random walks, up to their termination at the first hitting\ntime, are longer, on average, than those of the corresponding simple RWs.\nHowever, they are shorter than those of SAWs on the same network, which\nterminate at the last hitting time. We obtain analytical results for the\nprobabilities, $p_{\\rm ret}$ and $p_{\\rm trap}$, that a path will terminate by\nretracing, namely stepping into an already visited node, or by trapping, namely\nentering a node of degree $k=1$, which has no exit link, respectively. It is\nshown that in dilute networks the dominant termination scenario is trapping\nwhile in dense networks most paths terminate by retracing. We obtain\nexpressions for the conditional tail distributions of path lengths,\n$P(d>\\ell|{\\rm ret})$ and $P(d>\\ell|\\rm{trap})$, for those paths which\nterminate by retracing or by trapping, respectively. We also study a class of\ngeneralized non-backtracking random walk models which not only avoid the\nbacktracking step into the previous node but avoid stepping into the last $S$\nvisited nodes.\n", "  We review recent advances in understanding the universal scaling properties\nof non-equilibrium phase transitions in non-ergodic disordered systems. We\ndiscuss dynamical critical points (also known as eigenstate phase transitions)\nbetween different many-body localized (MBL) phases, and between MBL and thermal\nphases.\n", "  We show that in a class of non-supersymmetric left-right extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM), the lightest right-handed neutrino (RHN) can play the role\nof thermal Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe for a wide mass range from TeV to\nPeV. Our model is based on the gauge group $SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{Y_L}\\times U(1)_{Y_R}$ in which a heavy copy of the SM\nfermions are introduced and the stability of the RHN DM is guaranteed by an\nautomatic $Z_2$ symmetry present in the leptonic sector. In such models the\nactive neutrino masses are obtained via the type-II seesaw mechanism. We find a\nlower bound on the RHN DM mass of order TeV from relic density constraints, as\nwell as an unitarity upper bound in the multi-TeV to PeV scale, depending on\nthe entropy dilution factor. The RHN DM could be made long-lived by\nsoft-breaking of the $Z_2$ symmetry and provides a concrete example of decaying\nDM interpretation of the PeV neutrinos observed at IceCube.\n", "  Two new algorithms for use in the analysis of $pp$ collision are developed to\nidentify the flavour of $B^0$ mesons at production using pions and protons from\nthe hadronization process. The algorithms are optimized and calibrated on data,\nusing $B^0 \\rightarrow D^- \\pi^+$ decays from $pp$ collision data collected by\nLHCb at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The tagging power of the new\npion algorithm is 60 % greater than the previously available one; the algorithm\nusing protons to identify the flavour of a $B^0$ meson is the first of its\nkind.\n", "  Monte Carlo event generators contain a large number of parameters that must\nbe determined by comparing the output of the generator with experimental data.\nGenerating enough events with a fixed set of parameter values to enable making\nsuch a comparison is extremely CPU intensive, which prohibits performing a\nsimple brute-force grid-based tuning of the parameters. Bayesian optimization\nis a powerful method designed for such black-box tuning applications. In this\narticle, we show that Monte Carlo event generator parameters can be accurately\nobtained using Bayesian optimization and minimal expert-level physics\nknowledge. A tune of the PYTHIA 8 event generator using $e^+e^-$ events, where\n20 parameters are optimized, can be run on a modern laptop in just two days.\nCombining the Bayesian optimization approach with expert knowledge should\nenable producing better tunes in the future, by making it faster and easier to\nstudy discrepancies between Monte Carlo and experimental data.\n", "  The reliable computation time (RCT, marked as Tc) when applying a double\nprecision computation of a variable parameters logistic map (VPLM) is studied.\nFirst, using the method proposed, the reliable solutions for the logistic map\nare obtained. Second, for a time-dependent non-stationary parameters VPLM,\n10000 samples of reliable experiments are constructed, and the mean Tc is then\ncomputed. The results indicate that for each different initial value, the Tcs\nof the VPLM are generally different. However, the mean Tc trends to a constant\nvalue once the sample number is large enough. The maximum, minimum and probable\ndistribution function of Tc is also obtained, which can help us to identify the\nrobustness of applying a nonlinear time series theory to forecasting while\nusing the VPLM output. In addition, the Tc of the fixed parameter experiments\nof the logistic map was obtained, and the results suggested that this Tc\nmatches the theoretical formula predicted value.\n", "  I present a short review of recent studies of quarkonium production in\nproton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions at collider energies in Small-$x$\nformalism.\n", "  In recent experiments [T. Basta et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 111,\n670 (2014)] lipids and membrane proteins were observed to self-assemble into\nmembrane protein polyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs) with a well-defined\npolyhedral protein arrangement and characteristic size. We develop a model of\nMPPN self-assembly in which the preferred symmetry and size of MPPNs emerge\nfrom the interplay of protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, topological\ndefects in protein packing, and thermal effects. With all model parameters\ndetermined directly from experiments, our model correctly predicts the observed\nsymmetry and size of MPPNs. Our model suggests how key lipid and protein\nproperties can be modified to produce a range of MPPN symmetries and sizes in\nexperiments.\n", "  In the present work we report on the behavior of ferrofluid microdrops in an\nimmiscible nonmagnetic carrier fluid and vice versa subjected to the action of\nmagnetic fields. Our experiments evidence previously unexplored instability and\nflow patterns. We investigated the instabilities initiated by constant magnetic\nfield and by combined action of constant and rotating magnetic fields. The\nobserved instabilities lead to the formation of various microdrop\nconfigurations such as star-like and comb-like shapes, bending deformation,\nridges and crests, spiral arms and rings, etc. The reviled peculiarities of the\nmicroscopic drops behavior can be of interest in applications to the\nferrofluid-based microfluidics.\n", "  Tantalum, tantalum oxide and their hetero-interfaces are of tremendous\ntechnological interest in several applications spanning electronics, thermal\nmanagement, catalysis and biochemistry. For example, local oxygen stoichiometry\nvariation in TaOx memristors comprising of metallic (Ta) and insulating oxide\n(Ta2O5) have been shown to result in fast switching on the sub-nanosecond\ntimescale over a billion cycles, relevant to neuromorphic computation. Despite\nits broad importance, an atomistic scale understanding of oxygen stoichiometry\nvariation across Ta/TaOx hetero-interfaces, such as during early stages of\noxidation and oxide growth, is not well understood. This is mainly due to the\nlack of a variable charge interatomic potential model for tantalum oxides that\ncan accurately describe the ionic interactions in the metallic (Ta) and oxide\n(TaOx) environment as well as at their interfaces. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce a charge transfer ionic potential (CTIP) model for Ta/Ta-oxide\nsystem by training against lattice parameters, cohesive energies, equations of\nstate, and elastic properties of various experimentally observed Ta2O5\npolymorphs. The best set of CTIP parameters are determined by employing a\nsingle-objective global optimization scheme driven by genetic algorithms\nfollowed by local Simplex optimization. Our newly developed CTIP potential\naccurately predicts structure, thermodynamics, energetic ordering of\npolymorphs, as well as elastic and surface properties of both Ta and Ta2O5, in\nexcellent agreement with DFT calculations and experiments. We employ our newly\nparameterized CTIP potential to investigate the early stages of oxidation of Ta\nat different temperatures and atomic/molecular nature of the oxidizing species.\n", "  When the inversion symmetry is broken at a surface, spin-orbit interaction\ngives rise to spin-dependent energy shifts - a phenomenon which is known as the\nspin Rashba effect. Recently, it has been recognized that an orbital\ncounterpart of the spin Rashba effect - the orbital Rashba effect - can be\nrealized at surfaces even without spin- orbit coupling. Here, we propose a\nmechanism for the orbital Rashba effect based on sp orbital hybridization,\nwhich ultimately leads to the electric polarization of surface states. As a\nproof of principle, we show from first principles that this effect leads to\nchiral orbital textures in $\\mathbf{k}$-space of the BiAg$_2$ monolayer. In\npredicting the magnitude of the orbital moment arising from the orbital Rashba\neffect, we demonstrate the crucial role that the Berry phase theory plays for\nthe magnitude and variation of the orbital textures. As a result, we predict a\npronounced manifestation of various orbital effects at surfaces, and proclaim\nthe orbital Rashba effect to be a key platform for surface orbitronics.\n", "  We study the half filled extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square\nlattice using cluster dynamical mean field theory on clusters of size 8-20. We\nshow that the model exhibits metallic, Mott insulating, and charge ordered\nphases, and determine the location of the charge ordering phase transition line\nand the properties of the ordered and disordered phase as a function of\ntemperature, local interaction, and nearest neighbor interaction. We find\nstrong non-local correlations in the uniform phase and a pronounced screening\neffect in the vicinity of the phase transition, where non-local interactions\npush the system towards metallic behavior. In contrast, correlations in the\nordered phase are mostly local to the unit cell. Extrapolation to the\nthermodynamic limit and control of all sources of errors allow us to assess the\nregime of applicability of simpler approximation schemes for systems with\nnon-local interactions. We also demonstrate how strong non-local\nelectron-electron interactions can increase electron mobility by turning a\ncharge ordered insulator into a metal.\n", "  Many models of Higgs portal Dark Matter (DM) find themselves under pressure\nfrom increasingly tight direct detection constraints. In the framework of gauge\nfield DM, we study how such bounds can be relaxed while retaining the thermal\nWIMP paradigm. When the hidden sector gauge symmetry is broken via the Higgs\nmechanism, the hidden sector generally contains unstable states which are\nlighter than dark matter. These states provide DM with an efficient\nannihilation channel. As a result, the DM relic abundance and the direct\ndetection limits are controlled by different parameters, and the two can easily\nbe reconciled. This simple setup realizes the idea of `secluded' dark matter\nnaturally.\n", "  The equation of state of the SU($3$) Yang-Mills theory is determined in the\ndeconfined phase with a precision of about 0.5%. The calculation is carried out\nby numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory with shifted boundary\nconditions in the time direction. At each given temperature, up to $230\\, T_c$\nwith $T_c$ being the critical temperature, the entropy density is computed at\nseveral lattice spacings so to be able to extrapolate the results to the\ncontinuum limit with confidence. Taken at face value, above a few $T_c$ the\nresults exhibit a striking linear behaviour in $\\ln(T/T_c)^{-1}$ over almost 2\norders of magnitude. Within errors, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann\nvalue but with a slope grossly different from the leading-order perturbative\nprediction. The pressure is determined by integrating the entropy in the\ntemperature, while the energy density is extracted from $T s=(\\epsilon + p )$.\nThe continuum values of the potentials are well represented by Pad\\'e\ninterpolating formulas, which also connect them well to the Stefan-Boltzmann\nvalues in the infinite temperature limit. The pressure, the energy and the\nentropy densities are compared with results in the literature. The discrepancy\namong previous computations near $T_c$ is analyzed and resolved thanks to the\nhigh precision achieved.\n", "  Characterizing electromagnetic wave propagation in nonlinear and\ninhomogeneous media is of great interest from both theoretical and practical\nperspectives, even though it is extremely complicated. In fact, it is still an\nunresolved issue to find the exact solutions to the nonlinear waves in the\northogonal curvilinear coordinates. In this paper, we present an analytic\nmethod to handle the problem of electromagnetic waves propagation in\narbitrarily nonlinear and particularly inhomogeneous media without dispersion.\nThrough the exact solutions of the (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear Maxwell\nequations, we discuss some nonlinear phenomena, including cylindrical shock\nwaves, free nonlinear oscillations, and nonlinear superposition of waves.\n", "  When integrating out unknown new physics sectors, what is the minimal\ncharacter of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) that can result?\nIn this paper we focus on a particular aspect of this question: \"How can one\nobtain only one dimension six operator in the SMEFT from a consistent tree\nlevel matching onto an unknown new physics sector?\" We show why this requires\nconditions on the ultraviolet field content that do not indicate a stand alone\nultraviolet complete scenario. Further, we demonstrate how a dynamical origin\nof the ultraviolet scales assumed to exist in order to generate the masses of\nthe heavy states integrated out generically induces more operators. Therefore,\nour analysis indicates that the infrared limit captured from a new sector in\nconsistent matchings induces multiple operators in the SMEFT quite generically.\nGlobal data analyses in the SMEFT can and should accommodate this fact.\n", "  The effects of finite magnetization and electric polarization on dissipative\nand non-dissipative (anomalous) transport coefficients of a chiral fluid are\nstudied. First, using the second law of thermodynamics as well as Onsager's\ntime reversal symmetry principle, the complete set of dissipative transport\ncoefficients of this medium is derived. It is shown that the properties of the\nresulting shear and bulk viscosities are mainly affected by the anisotropy\ninduced by external electric and magnetic fields. Then, using the fact that the\nanomaly induced currents do not contribute to entropy production, the\ncorresponding algebro-differential equations to non-dissipative anomalous\ntransport coefficients are derived in a certain derivative expansion. The\nsolutions of these equations show that, within this approximation, anomalous\ntransport coefficients are, in particular, given in terms of the electric\nsusceptibility of the medium.\n", "  We present the results of a lattice study of the normalization constants and\nsecond moments of the light-cone distribution amplitudes of longitudinally and\ntransversely polarized $\\rho$ mesons. The calculation is performed using two\nflavors of dynamical clover fermions at lattice spacings between\n$0.060\\,\\text{fm}$ and $0.081\\,\\text{fm}$, different lattice volumes up to\n$m_\\pi L = 6.7$ and pion masses down to $m_\\pi=150\\,\\text{MeV}$. Bare lattice\nresults are renormalized non-perturbatively using a variant of the RI'-MOM\nscheme and converted to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme. The necessary\nconversion coefficients, which are not available in the literature, are\ncalculated. The chiral extrapolation for the relevant decay constants is worked\nout in detail. We obtain for the ratio of the tensor and vector coupling\nconstants $f_\\rho^T/f_\\rho^{\\vphantom{T}} = 0.629(8)$ and the values of the\nsecond Gegenbauer moments $a_2^\\parallel = 0.132(27)$ and $a_2^\\perp =\n0.101(22)$ at the scale $\\mu = 2\\,\\text{GeV}$ for the longitudinally and\ntransversely polarized $\\rho$ mesons, respectively. The errors include the\nstatistical uncertainty and estimates of the systematics arising from\nrenormalization. Discretization errors cannot be estimated reliably and are not\nincluded. In this calculation the possibility of $\\rho\\to\\pi\\pi$ decay at the\nsmaller pion masses is not taken into account.\n", "  Using the composite boson (coboson) many-body formalism, we determine under\nwhich conditions \"trion-polariton\" can exist. Dipolar attraction can bind an\nexciton and an electron into a trion having an energy well separated from the\nexciton energy. Yet, the existence of long-lived \"trion-polariton\" is a priori\nimplausible not only because the photon-trion coupling, which scales as the\ninverse of the sample volume, is vanishingly small, but mostly because this\ncoupling is intrinsically \"weak\". Here, we show that a moderately dense Fermi\nsea renders its observation possible: on the pro side, the Fermi sea overcomes\nthe weak coupling by pinning the photon to its momentum through Pauli blocking,\nit also overcomes the dramatically poor photon-trion coupling by providing a\nvolume-linear trion subspace to which the photon is coherently coupled. On the\ncon side, the Fermi sea broadens the photon-trion resonance due to the\nfermionic nature of trions and electrons, it also weakens the trion binding by\nblocking electronic states relevant for trion formation. As a result, the\nproper way to observe this novel polariton is to use doped semiconductor having\nlong-lived electronic states, highly-bound trion and Fermi energy as large as a\nfraction of the trion binding energy.\n", "  We describe the time-dependent restricted-active-space self-consistent-field\n(TD-RASSCF) method for a system of interacting bosons. We provide the theory of\nthe method and discuss its numerical implementation. The method provides a\ngeneral wavefunction based approach to solve the time-dependent and\ntime-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a system of bosons. It is based on\nthe time-dependent variational principle to optimize at each instant of time a\nset of time-dependent coefficients and time-dependent orbitals used to describe\nthe total wavefunction. Including the concept of a restricted-active-space, the\nexponential growth of the configurational space, resulting from all possible\ndistributions of $N$ bosons in $M$ orbitals, can be controlled trough a\nspecific excitation scheme. We show, by illustrative time-independent and\ntime-dependent examples, that the method provides an accurate description of\nthe system with a substantially smaller configurational space than the one\nrequired in the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons\n(MCTDHB). The TD-RASSCF method can also tackle problems beyond the reach of the\nMCTDHB method when a large number of orbitals are required.\n", "  The typical medium dynamical cluster approximation (TMDCA) is reformulated in\nthe language of multiple scattering theory to make possible first principles\ncalculations of the electronic structure of substitutionally disordered alloys\nincluding the effect of Anderson localization. The TMDCA allows for a\nsystematic inclusion of non-local multi-site correlations and at same time\nprovides an order parameter, the typical density of states, for the Anderson\nlocalization transition. The relation between the dynamical cluster\napproximation and the multiple scattering theory is analyzed, and is\nillustrated for a tight-binding model.\n", "  We present a systematic procedure for analyzing cumulants to arbitrary order\nin the context of heavy-ion collisions. It generalizes and improves existing\nprocedures in many respects. In particular, particles which are correlated are\nallowed to belong to different phase-space windows, which may overlap. It also\nallows for the analysis of cumulants at any order, using a simple algorithm\nrather than complicated expressions to be derived and coded by hand. In the\ncase of azimuthal correlations, it automatically corrects to leading order for\ndetector non-uniformity, and it is useful for numerous other applications as\nwell. We discuss several of these applications: anisotropic flow, event-plane\ncorrelations, symmetric cumulants, net baryon and net charge fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate the scaling properties of the order parameter and the largest\nnonvanishing Lyapunov exponent for the fully locked state in the Kuramoto model\nwith a finite number $N$ of oscillators. We show that, for any finite value of\n$N$, both quantities scale as $(K-K_L)^{1/2}$ with the coupling strength $K$\nsufficiently close to the locking threshold $K_L$. We confirm numerically these\npredictions for oscillator frequencies evenly spaced in the interval $[-1, 1]$\nand additionally find that the coupling range $\\delta K$ over which this\nscaling is valid shrinks like $\\delta K \\sim N^{-\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha\\approx1.5$ as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. Away from this interval, the\norder parameter exhibits the infinite-$N$ behavior $r-r_L \\sim (K-K_L)^{2/3}$\nproposed by Paz\\'o [Phys. Rev. E 72, 046211 (2005)]. We argue that the\ncrossover between the two behaviors occurs because at the locking threshold,\nthe upper bound of the continuous part of the spectrum of the fully locked\nstate approaches zero as $N$ increases. Our results clarify the convergence to\nthe $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ limit in the Kuramoto model.\n", "  We have accurately determined the exciton binding energy and reduced mass of\nsingle crystals of methylammonium lead tri-iodide using magneto-reflectivity at\nvery high magnetic fields. The single crystal has excellent optical properties\nwith a narrow line width of $\\sim 3$meV for the excitonic transitions and a 2s\ntransition which is clearly visible even at zero magnetic field. The exciton\nbinding energy of $16 \\pm 2$meV in the low temperature orthorhombic phase is\nalmost identical to the value found in polycrystalline samples, crucially\nruling out any possibility that the exciton binding energy depends on the grain\nsize. In the room temperature tetragonal phase, an upper limit for the exciton\nbinding energy of $12 \\pm 4$ meV is estimated from the evolution of 1s-2s\nsplitting at high magnetic field.\n", "  The 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization should be observed within the\nnext decade. While a simple statistical detection is expected with SKA\npathfinders, the SKA will hopefully produce a full 3D mapping of the signal. To\nextract from the observed data constraints on the parameters describing the\nunderlying astrophysical processes, inversion methods must be developed. For\nexample, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method has been successfully applied.\nHere we test another possible inversion method: artificial neural networks\n(ANN). We produce a training set which consists of 70 individual sample. Each\nsample is made of the 21 cm power spectrum at different redshifts produced with\nthe 21cmFast code plus the value of three parameters used in the semi-numerical\nsimulations that describe astrophysical processes. Using this set we train the\nnetwork to minimize the error between the parameter values it produces as an\noutput and the true values. We explore the impact of the architecture of the\nnetwork on the quality of the training. Then we test the trained network on the\nnew set of 54 test samples with different values of the parameters. We find\nthat the quality of the parameter reconstruction depends on the sensitivity of\nthe power spectrum to the different parameters at a given redshift, that\nincluding thermal noise and sample variance decreases the quality of the\nreconstruction and that using the power spectrum at several redshifts as an\ninput to the ANN improves the quality of the reconstruction. We conclude that\nANNs are a viable inversion method whose main strength is that they require a\nsparse exploration of the parameter space and thus should be usable with full\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  When a massive star in a binary system explodes as a supernova its companion\nstar may be polluted with heavy elements from the supernova ejecta. Such a\npollution had been detected in a handful of post-supernova binaries (Gonzalez\nHernandez et al. 2011), but none of them is associated with a supernova\nremnant. We report the discovery of a solar-type star in a close, eccentric\nbinary system with a neutron star within the young Galactic supernova remnant\nRCW 86. Our discovery implies that the supernova progenitor was a moving star,\nwhich exploded near the edge of its wind bubble and lost most of its initial\nmass due to common-envelope evolution shortly before core collapse. We find\nthat the solar-type star is strongly polluted with calcium and other elements,\nwhich places the explosion within the class of calcium-rich supernovae -- faint\nand fast transients (Filippenko et al. 2003; Kasliwal et al. 2012}, whose\norigin is strongly debated (Kawabata et al. 2010; Waldman et al. 2011), and\nprovides the first observational evidence that supernovae of this type can\narise from core-collapse explosions (Kawabata et al. 2010; Moriya et al. 2010).\n", "  String theory generically predicts the coupling between the Affleck-Dine\nfield and axion field through higher-dimensional operators. We thus explore the\nAffleck-Dine baryogenesis on an axion background. It turns out that the axion\noscillation produces an enough amount of baryon asymmetry of the Universe just\nafter the inflation, even without a soft supersymmetry-breaking $A$-term. This\nbaryogenesis scenario is applicable to the string axion inflation.\n", "  Part of developing new strategies for fabrications of nanowire structures\ninvolves in many cases the aid of metal nanoparticles (NPs). It is highly\nbeneficial if one can define both diameter and position of the initial NPs and\nmake well-defined nanowire arrays. This sets additional requirement on the NPs\nwith respect to being able to withstand a pre-growth annealing process (i.e.\nde- oxidation of the III-V semiconductor surface) in an epitaxy system.\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that Ag may be an alternative to using Au\nNPs as seeds for particle-seeded nanowire fabrication. This work brings light\nonto the effect of annealing of Au, Ag and Au-Ag alloy NP arrays in two\ncommonly used epitaxial systems, the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and the\nMetalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). The NP arrays are fabricated with the\naid of Electron Beam Lithography on GaAs 100 and 111B wafers and the evolution\nof the NPs with respect to shape, size and position on the surfaces are studied\nafter annealing using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We find that while\nthe Au NP arrays are found to be stable when annealed up to 600 $^{\\circ}$C in\na MOVPE system, a diameter and pitch dependent splitting of the particles are\nseen for annealing in a MBE system. The Ag NP arrays are less stable, with\nsmaller diameters ($\\leq$ 50 nm) dissolving during annealing in both epitaxial\nsystems. In general, the mobility of the NPs is observed to differ between the\ntwo the GaAs 100 and 111B surfaces. While the initial pattern is found be\nintact on the GaAs 111B surface for a particular annealing process and particle\ntype, the increased mobility of the NP on the 100 may influence the initial\npre-defined positions at higher annealing temperatures. The effect of annealing\non Au-Ag alloy NP arrays suggests that these NP can withstand necessary\nannealing conditions for a complete de-oxidation of GaAs surfaces.\n", "  The spin memory effect is a recently predicted relativistic phenomenon in\nasymptotically flat spacetimes that become nonradiative infinitely far in the\npast and future. Between these early and late times, the magnetic-parity part\nof the time integral of the gravitational-wave strain can undergo a nonzero\nchange; this difference is the spin memory effect. Families of freely falling\nobservers around an isolated source can measure this effect, in principle, and\nfluxes of angular momentum per unit solid angle (or changes in superspin\ncharges) generate the effect. The spin memory effect had not been computed\nexplicitly for astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, such as compact\nbinaries. In this paper, we compute the spin memory in terms of a set of\nradiative multipole moments of the gravitational-wave strain. The result of\nthis calculation allows us to establish the following results about the spin\nmemory: (i) We find that the accumulation of the spin memory behaves in a\nqualitatively different way from that of the displacement memory effect for\nnonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries in the post-Newtonian\napproximation: the spin memory undergoes a large secular growth over the\nduration of the inspiral, whereas for the displacement effect this increase is\nsmall. (ii) The rate at which the spin memory grows is equivalent to a\nnonlinear, but nonoscillatory and nonhereditary effect in the gravitational\nwaveform that had been previously calculated for nonspinning, quasicircular\ncompact binaries. (iii) This rate of build-up of the spin memory could\npotentially be detected by future gravitational-wave detectors by carefully\ncombining the measured waveforms from hundreds of gravitational-wave detections\nof compact binaries.\n", "  The admittance of two types of Josephson weak links is calculated, i.e., of a\none-dimensional superconducting wire with a local suppression of the order\nparameter, and the second is a short S-c-S structure, where S denotes a\nsuperconductor and c---a constriction. The systems of the first type are\nanalyzed on the basis of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. We show that\nthe impedance $Z(\\Omega)$ has a maximum as a function of the frequency\n$\\Omega$, and the electric field $E_{\\Omega}$ is determined by two\ngauge-invariant quantities---the condensate momentum $Q_{\\Omega}$ and the\npotential $\\mu$ related to charge imbalance. The structures of the second type\nare studied on the basis of microscopic equations for quasiclassical Green's\nfunctions in the Keldysh technique. For short S-c-S contacts (the Thouless\nenergy ${E_{\\text{Th}} = D/L^{2} \\gg \\Delta}$) we present a formula for\nadmittance $Y$ valid at frequencies $\\Omega$ and temperatures $T$ less than the\nThouless energy but arbitrary with respect to the energy gap $\\Delta$. It is\nshown that, at low temperatures, the absorption is absent [${\\mathrm{Re}(Y) =\n0}$] if the frequency does not exceed the energy gap in the center of the\nconstriction (${\\Omega < \\Delta \\cos \\varphi_{0}}$, where $2 \\varphi_{0}$ is\nthe phase difference between the S reservoirs). The absorption gradually\nincreases with increasing the difference ${(\\Omega - \\Delta \\cos \\varphi_{0})}$\nif $2 \\varphi_{0}$ is less than the phase difference $2 \\varphi_{\\text{c}}$\ncorresponding to the critical Josephson current. In the interval ${2\n\\varphi_{\\text{c}} < 2 \\varphi_{0} < \\pi}$, the absorption has a maximum. This\ninterval of the phase difference is achievable in phase-biased Josephson\njunctions. Close to $T_{\\text{c}}$ the admittance has a maximum at low $\\Omega$\nwhich is described by an analytical formula.\n", "  An influence of multi-line CO laser focusing on spectral characteristics of\nbroadband sum-frequency generation in ZnGeP2 nonlinear crystal was\nexperimentally and numerically studied. Maximal frequency conversion was\nexperimentally observed under tight focusing of the multi-line rather than\nsingle-line CO laser. The tight focusing resulted in broadening sum-frequency\ngeneration spectrum and increasing total, i.e. integrated over the spectrum,\nfrequency conversion efficiency. These effects were due to increasing\nphase-matching bandwidth and angular dispersion. Maximal conversion efficiency\nof the multi-line CO laser was numerically demonstrated to take place at the\nfocal length of 0.4 times that for the single-line one.\n", "  The previously proposed class of phenomenological inflationary models in\nwhich the assumption of inflaton slow-roll is replaced by the more general,\nconstant-roll condition is compared with the most recent cosmological\nobservational data, mainly the Planck ones. Models in this two-parametric class\nwhich remain viable appear to be close to the slow-roll ones, and their\ninflaton potentials are close to (but still different from) that of the natural\ninflation model. Permitted regions for the two model parameters are presented.\n", "  We show how to significantly reduce the number of energy bands required to\nmodel the interaction of light with crystalline solids in the velocity gauge.\nWe achieve this by deriving analytical corrections to the electric current\ndensity. These corrections depend only on band energies, the matrix elements of\nthe momentum operator, and the macroscopic vector potential. Thus, the\ncorrections can be evaluated independently from modeling the interaction with\nlight. In addition to improving the convergence of velocity-gauge calculations,\nour analytical approach overcomes the long-standing problem of divergences in\nexpressions for linear and nonlinear susceptibilities.\n", "  We present results for the (color)magnetic and (color)electric screening\nmasses of the Quark-Gluon Plasma in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nThe screening masses are extracted from the correlators of Polyakov loops,\ndetermined by lattice QCD simulations at the physical point. We explore\ntemperatures in the range $200\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\lesssim T\\lesssim\n330\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and magnetic field intensities up to $|e|B \\sim\n1.3\\,\\mathrm{GeV}^2$. We find that both screening masses are increasing\nfunctions of the magnetic field and that the dependence on $B$ becomes weaker\nfor larger temperatures. In the case of the magnetic screening mass a slight\nanisotropy is also observable.\n", "  The thermodynamics of coupled frustrated ferromagnetic chains is studied\nwithin a spin-rotation-invariant Green's function approach. We consider an\nisotropic Heisenberg spin-half system with a ferromagnetic in-chain coupling\n$J_1<0$ between nearest neighbors and a frustrating antiferromagnetic\nnext-nearest neighbor in-chain coupling $J_2>0$. We focus on moderate strength\nof frustration $J_2 < |J_1|/4$ such that the in-chain spin-spin correlations\nare predominantly ferromagnetic. We consider two inter-chain couplings (ICs)\n$J_{\\perp,y}$ and $J_{\\perp,z}$, corresponding to the two axis perpendicular to\nthe chain, where ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic ICs are taken into\naccount. We discuss the influence of frustration on the ground-state properties\nfor antiferromagnetic ICs, where the ground state is of quantum nature. The\nmajor part of our study is devoted to the finite-temperature properties. We\ncalculate the critical temperature $T_{c}$ as a function of the competing\nexchange couplings $J_{2},J_{\\perp,y}, J_{\\perp,z}$. We find that for fixed ICs\n$T_c$ monotonically decreases with increasing frustration $J_2$, where as $J_2\n\\to |J_1|/4$ the $T_c(J_2)$-curve drops down rapidly. To characterize the\nmagnetic ordering below and above $T_c$ we calculate the spin-spin correlation\nfunctions $\\langle {\\bf S}_0 {\\bf S}_{\\bf R} \\rangle$, the magnetic order\nparameter $M$, the uniform static susceptibility $\\chi_0$ as well as the\ncorrelation length $\\xi$. Moreover, we discuss the specific heat $C_V$ and the\ntemperature dependence of the excitation spectrum $\\omega_{\\mathbf{q}}$. As\n$J_2 \\to |J_1|/4$ some unusual frustration-induced features were found, such as\nan increase of the in-chain spin stiffness (in case of ferromagnetic ICs) or of\nthe in-chain spin-wave velocity (in case of antiferromagnetic ICs) with growing\ntemperature.\n", "  A framework is developed enabling the global analysis of the stability of\ncosmological models using the local geometric characteristics of the\ninfinite-dimensional superspace, i.e. using the generalised Jacobi equation\nreformulated for pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We give a direct formalism for\ndynamical analysis in the superspace, the requisite equation pertinent for\nstability analysis of the universe by means of generalized covariant and Fermi\nderivative is derived. Then, the relevant definitions and formulae are\nretrieved for cosmological models with a scalar field.\n", "  (60558) 174P/Echeclus is an unusual object that belongs to a class of minor\nplanets called Centaurs, which may be intermediate between Kuiper Belt Objects\nand Jupiter Family comets. It is sporadically active throughout its orbit at\ndistances too far for water ice to sublimate, the source of activity for most\ncomets. Thus, its coma must be triggered by another mechanism. In 2005,\nEcheclus had a strong outburst with peculiar behavior that raised questions\nabout the nucleus homogeneity. In order to test nucleus models, we performed\nthe most sensitive search to date for the highly volatile CO molecule via its\nJ=2-1 emission toward Echeclus during 2016 May-June (at 6.1 astronomical units\nfrom the Sun) using the Arizona Radio Observatory 10-m Submillimeter Telescope.\nWe obtained a 3.6-sigma detection with a slightly blue-shifted (delta v = -0.55\n+- 0.1 km/s) and narrow (FWHM = 0.53 +- 0.23 km/s) line. The data are\nconsistent with emission from a cold gas from the sunward side of the nucleus,\nas seen in two other comets at 6 AU. We derive a production rate of Q(CO) =\n(7.7 +- 3.3)x10^26 mol/s, which is capable of driving the estimated dust\nproduction rates. Echeclus CO outgassing rate is ~40 times lower than what is\ntypically seen for another Centaur at this distance, 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann\n1. We also used the IRAM 30-m telescope to search for the CO J=2-1 line, and\nderive an upper limit that is above the SMT detection. Compared to the\nrelatively unprocessed comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), Echeclus produces\nsignificantly less CO, as do Chiron and four other Centaurs.\n", "  A passive and reciprocal perfectly refractive metasurface is designed using a\ngeneral susceptiblity synthesis method. The metasurface uses weak spatial\ndispersion in the form of bianisotropy to achieve perfect refraction. Its\noperation is validated using a full-wave simulation of the metasurface\nimplemented with cascaded metallic layers separated by dielectric.\n", "  We present Monte Carlo data of the stress-strain diagrams obtained using two\ndifferent triangulated surface models. The first is the canonical surface model\nof Helfrich and Polyakov (HP), and the second is a Finsler geometry (FG) model.\nThe shape of the experimentally observed stress-strain diagram is called\nJ-shaped. Indeed, the diagram has a plateau for the small strain region and\nbecomes linear in the relatively large strain region. Because of this highly\nnon-linear behavior, the J-shaped diagram is far beyond the scope of the\nordinary theory of elasticity. Therefore, the mechanism behind the J-shaped\ndiagram still remains to be clarified, although it is commonly believed that\nthe collagen degrees of freedom play an essential role. We find that the FG\nmodeling technique provides a coarse-grained picture for the interaction\nbetween the collagen and the bulk material. The role of the directional degrees\nof freedom of collagen molecules or fibers can be understood in the context of\nFG modeling. We also discuss the reason for why the J-shaped diagram cannot\n(can) be explained by the HP (FG) model.\n", "  The low-lying unbound level structure of the halo nucleus $^{19}\\textrm{C}$\nhas been investigated using single-neutron knockout from $^{20}\\textrm{C}$ on a\ncarbon target at 280 MeV/nucleon. The invariant mass spectrum, derived from the\nmomenta of the forward going beam velocity $^{18}\\textrm{C}$ fragment and\nneutrons, was found to be dominated by a very narrow near threshold\n($E_\\textrm{rel}$ = 0.036(1) MeV) peak. Two less strongly populated\nresonance-like features were also observed at $E_\\textrm{rel}$ = 0.84(4) and\n2.31(3) MeV, both of which exhibit characteristics consistent with neutron\n$p$-shell hole states. Comparisons of the energies, measured cross sections and\nparallel momentum distributions to the results of shell-model and eikonal\nreaction calculations lead to spin-parity assignments of $5/2^+_1$ and\n$1/2^-_1$ for the levels at $E_x$ = 0.62(9) and 2.89(10) MeV with $S_n$ =\n0.58(9) MeV. Spectroscopic factors were also deduced and found to be in\nreasonable accord with shell-model calculations. The valence neutron\nconfiguration of the $^{20}\\textrm{C}$ ground state is thus seen to include, in\naddition to the known $1s^2_{1/2}$ component, a significant $0d^2_{5/2}$\ncontribution. The level scheme of $^{19}\\textrm{C}$, including significantly\nthe $1/2^-_1$ cross-shell state, is well accounted for by the YSOX shell-model\ninteraction developed from the monopole-based universal interaction.\n", "  New physics is being explored with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and with\nIntensity Frontier programs at Fermilab and KEK. The energy scale for new\nphysics is known to be in the multi-TeV range, signaling the need for a future\ncollider which well surpasses this energy scale. We explore a 10$^{\\,34}$\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ luminosity, 100 TeV $p\\bar{p}$ collider with 7$\\times$ the\nenergy of the LHC but only 2$\\times$ as much NbTi superconductor, motivating\nthe choice of 4.5 T single bore dipoles. The cross section for many high mass\nstates is 10 times higher in $p\\bar{p}$ than $pp$ collisions. Antiquarks for\nproduction can come directly from an antiproton rather than indirectly from\ngluon splitting. The higher cross sections reduce the synchrotron radiation in\nsuperconducting magnets and the number of events per beam crossing, because\nlower beam currents can produce the same rare event rates. Events are more\ncentrally produced, allowing a more compact detector with less space between\nquadrupole triplets and a smaller $\\beta^{*}$ for higher luminosity. A\nFermilab-like $\\bar p$ source would disperse the beam into 12 momentum channels\nto capture more antiprotons. Because stochastic cooling time scales as the\nnumber of particles, 12 cooling ring sets would be used. Each set would include\nphase rotation to lower momentum spreads, equalize all momentum channels, and\nstochastically cool. One electron cooling ring would follow the stochastic\ncooling rings. Finally antiprotons would be recycled during runs without\nleaving the collider ring by joining them to new bunches with synchrotron\ndamping.\n", "  Membrane proteins and lipids can self-assemble into membrane protein\npolyhedral nanoparticles (MPPNs). MPPNs have a closed spherical surface and a\npolyhedral protein arrangement, and may offer a new route for structure\ndetermination of membrane proteins and targeted drug delivery. We develop here\na general analytic model of how MPPN self-assembly depends on bilayer-protein\ninteractions and lipid bilayer mechanical properties. We find that the\nbilayer-protein hydrophobic thickness mismatch is a key molecular control\nparameter for MPPN shape that can be used to bias MPPN self-assembly towards\nhighly symmetric and uniform MPPN shapes. Our results suggest strategies for\noptimizing MPPN shape for structural studies of membrane proteins and targeted\ndrug delivery.\n", "  A new solution to the strong CP problem with distinct experimental signatures\nat the LHC is proposed. It is based on the Yukawa interactions between mirror\nquarks, Standard Model (SM) quarks and Higgs singlets. (Mirror quarks and\nleptons which include non-sterile right-handed neutrinos whose Majorana masses\nare proportional to the electroweak scale, form the basis of the EW-$\\nu_R$\nmodel.) The aforementioned Yukawa couplings can in general be complex and can\ncontribute to $Arg\\, Det M$ ($\\bar{\\theta} = \\theta_{QCD} + Arg\\, Det M$) at\ntree-level. The crux of matter in this manuscript is the fact that {\\em no\nmatter how large} the CP-violating phases in the Yukawa couplings might be,\n$Arg\\, Det M$ can remain small i.e. $\\bar{\\theta} < 10^{-10}$ for reasonable\nvalues of the Yukawa couplings and, in fact, vanishes when the VEV of the Higgs\nsinglet (responsible for the Dirac part of the neutrino mass in the seesaw\nmechanism) vanishes. The smallness of the contribution to $\\bar{\\theta}$ is\n{\\em principally due} to the smallness of the ratio of the two mass scales in\nthe seesaw mechanism: the Dirac and Majorana mass scales.\n", "  Lorentz Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) observations of magnetic\nnanoparticles contain information on the magnetic and electrostatic potentials.\nVector Field Electron Tomography (VFET) can be used to reconstruct\nelectromagnetic potentials of the nanoparticles from their corresponding LTEM\nimages. The VFET approach is based on the conventional filtered back projection\napproach to tomographic reconstructions and the availability of an incomplete\nset of measurements due to experimental limitations means that the\nreconstructed vector fields exhibit significant artifacts. In this paper, we\noutline a model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm to reconstruct\nthe magnetic vector potential of magnetic nanoparticles. We combine a forward\nmodel for image formation in TEM experiments with a prior model to formulate\nthe tomographic problem as a maximum a-posteriori probability estimation\nproblem (MAP). The MAP cost function is minimized iteratively to determine the\nvector potential. A comparative reconstruction study of simulated as well as\nexperimental data sets show that the MBIR approach yields quantifiably better\nreconstructions than the VFET approach.\n", "  An innovative and novel quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS)\nsensor for highly sensitive and selective breath gas analysis is introduced.\nThe QEPAS sensor consists of two acoustically coupled micro-resonators (mR)\nwith an off-axis 20 kHz quartz tuning fork (QTF). The complete acoustically\ncoupled mR system is optimized based on finite element simulations and\nexperimentally verified. Due to the very low fabrication costs the QEPAS sensor\npresents a clear breakthrough in the field of photoacoustic spectroscopy by\nintroducing novel disposable gas chambers in order to avoid cleaning after each\ntest. The QEPAS sensor is pumped resonantly by a nanosecond pulsed single-mode\nmid-infrared optical parametric oscillator (MIR OPO). Spectroscopic\nmeasurements of methane and methanol in the 3.1 $\\mu$m to 3.7 $\\mu$m wavelength\nregion is conducted. Demonstrating a resolution bandwidth of 1 cm$^{-1}$. An\nAllan deviation analysis shows that the detection limit at optimum integration\ntime for the QEPAS sensor is 32 ppbv@190s for methane and that the background\nnoise is solely due to the thermal noise of the QTF. Spectra of both individual\nmolecules as well as mixtures of molecules were measured and analyzed. The\nmolecules are representative of exhaled breath gasses that are bio-markers for\nmedical diagnostics.\n", "  We have detected and performed signal measurements on 78 individual bolide\nevents as recorded at 179 infrasound stations between 2006 and 2015. We\ncompared period-yield relations with AFTAC nuclear period-yield data, finding\nthese to be similar with a slight offset. Scatter in period measurements for\nindividual bolide is found to be caused in part by station noise levels and by\nattenuation effects with range. No correlation was found between the infrasound\nsignal period and any of bolide height at peak brightness, entry speed or\nimpact angle. We examined in detail three well constrained bolides having\nenergy deposition curves, known trajectories and infrasound detections finding\nsome evidence at shorter ranges that a component of station period scatter is\ndue to varying source heights sampled by different stations. However, for\nlonger-range stations in these three case studies, we were not able to assign\nunique source heights using raytracing due to large uncertainties in\natmospheric conditions. Our results suggest that while source height\ncontributes to the observed variance in infrasound signal periods from a given\nbolide, range and station noise play a larger role.\n", "  We extend previous studies of big bang nucleosynthesis, with the assumption\nthat ordinary matter and dark matter sectors are entangled through the number\nof degrees of freedom entering the Friedmann equations. This conjecture allows\nus to find a relation between the temperatures of the weakly interacting matter\nand dark-matter sectors. The constraints imposed by observations are studied by\ncomparison with calculations of big bang nucleosynthesis for the abundance of\nlight elements. It is found that these constraints are compatible with cold\ndark matter and a wide range number of dark sectors.\n", "  The quasi-skutterudite superconductors $A_3T_4$Sn$_{13}$ ($A$=Sr, Ca; $T$=Ir,\nRh, Co) are highly tunable featuring a structural quantum critical point. We\nconstruct a temperature-lattice constant phase diagram for these isovalent\ncompounds, establishing Ca$_{3}$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and Ca$_{3}$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$ as\nmembers close to and far away from the structural quantum critical point,\nrespectively. Deconvolution of the lattice specific heat and the electrical\nresistivity provide an approximate phonon density of states $F(\\omega)$ and the\nelectron-phonon transport coupling function $\\alpha_{tr}^2F(\\omega)$ for\nCa$_{3}$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and Ca$_{3}$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$, enabling us to investigate\nthe influence of the structural quantum critical point. Our results support the\nscenario of phonon softening close to the structural quantum critical point,\nand explain the enhancement of the coupling strength on approaching structural\ninstability.\n", "  We study the modifications of the amplitudes and cross sections of several\nprocesses, especially $e^+e^- \\to t\\bar t H, t\\bar t Z, t\\bar b W$, generated\nby Higgs boson and top quark compositeness, in particular within the CSM\nconcept. We illustrate the observable differences that may appear between\nvarious, CSM conserving or CSM violating, compositeness possibilities.\n", "  Materials composed of two dimensional layers bonded to one another through\nweak van der Waals interactions often exhibit strongly anisotropic behaviors\nand can be cleaved into very thin specimens and sometimes into monolayer\ncrystals. Interest in such materials is driven by the study of low dimensional\nphysics and the design of functional heterostructures. Binary compounds with\nthe compositions MX2 and MX3 where M is a metal cation and X is a halogen anion\noften form such structures. Magnetism can be incorporated by choosing a\ntransition metal with a partially filled d-shell for M, enabling ferroic\nresponses for enhanced functionality. Here a brief overview of binary\ntransition metal dihalides and trihalides is given, summarizing their\ncrystallographic properties and long-range-ordered magnetic structures,\nfocusing on those materials with layered crystal structures and partially\nfilled d-shells required for combining low dimensionality and cleavability with\nmagnetism.\n", "  We study the geometry of elliptic fibrations satisfying the conditions of\nStep 8 of Tate's algorithm. We call such geometries F$_4$-models, as the dual\ngraph of their special fiber is the twisted affine Dynkin diagram\n$\\widetilde{\\text{F}}_4^t$. These geometries are used in string theory to model\ngauge theories with the exceptional Lie group F$_4$ on a smooth divisor $S$ of\nthe base. Starting with a singular Weierstrass model of an F$_4$-model, we\npresent a crepant resolution of its singularities. We study the fiber structure\nof this smooth elliptic fibration and identify the fibral divisors up to\nisomorphism as schemes over $S$. These are $\\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles over $S$ or\ndouble covers of $\\mathbb{P}^1$-bundles over $S$. We compute basic topological\ninvariants such as the double and triple intersection numbers of the fibral\ndivisors and the Euler characteristic of the F$_4$-model.\n  In the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds, we compute the linear form induced by\nthe second Chern class and the Hodge numbers. We also explore the meaning of\nthese geometries for the physics of gauge theories in five and six-dimensional\nminimal supergravity theories with eight supercharges.\n  We also introduce the notion of \"frozen representations\" and explore the role\nof the Stein factorization in the study of fibral divisors of elliptic\nfibrations.\n", "  We present $Suzaku$ off-center observations of two poor galaxy groups, NGC\n3402 and NGC 5129, with temperatures below 1 keV. Through spectral\ndecomposition, we measure their surface brightnesses and temperatures out to\n330 and 680 times the critical density of the universe for NGC 3402 and NGC\n5129, respectively. These quantities are consistent with extrapolations from\nexisting inner measurements of the two groups. With the refined X-ray\nluminosities, both groups prefer $L_X-T$ relations without a break in the group\nregime. Furthermore, we measure the electron number densities and hydrostatic\nmasses at these radii. We find that the electron number density profiles\nrequire three $\\beta$ model components, with nearly flat slopes in the 3$^{rd}$\n$\\beta$ component for both groups. However, we find the effective slope in the\noutskirts to be $\\beta_{out}$ = 0.59 and 0.49 for NGC 3402 and NGC 5129,\nrespectively. Adding the gas mass measured from the X-ray data and stellar mass\nfrom group galaxy members, we measure baryon fractions of $f_b$ = 0.113 $\\pm$\n0.013 and 0.091 $\\pm$ 0.006 for NGC 3402 and NGC 5129, respectively. Combining\nother poor groups with well measured X-ray emission to the outskirts, we find\nan average baryon fraction of $f_{b,ave}$ = 0.100 $\\pm$ 0.004 for X-ray bright\ngroups with temperatures between 0.8$-$1.3 keV, extending existing constraints\nto lower mass systems.\n", "  We introduce a new Bayesian HI spectral line fitting technique capable of\nobtaining spectroscopic redshifts for millions of galaxies in radio surveys\nwith the Square Kilometere Array (SKA). This technique is especially\nwell-suited to the low signal-to-noise regime that the redshifted 21-cm HI\nemission line is expected to be observed in, especially with SKA Phase 1,\nallowing for robust source detection. After selecting a set of continuum\nobjects relevant to large, cosmological-scale surveys with the first phase of\nthe SKA dish array (SKA1-MID), we simulate data corresponding to their HI line\nemission as observed by the same telescope. We then use the MultiNest nested\nsampling code to find the best-fitting parametrised line profile, providing us\nwith a full joint posterior probability distribution for the galaxy properties,\nincluding redshift. This provides high quality redshifts, with redshift errors\n$\\Delta z / z <10^{-5}$, from radio data alone for some 1.8 million galaxies in\na representative 5000 square degree survey with the SKA1-MID instrument with\nup-to-date sensitivity profiles. Interestingly, we find that the SNR definition\ncommonly used in forecast papers does not correlate well with the actual\ndetectability of an HI line using our method. We further detail how our method\ncould be improved with per-object priors and how it may be also used to give\nrobust constraints on other observables such as the HI mass function. We also\nmake our line fitting code publicly available for application to other data\nsets.\n", "  We report on laser-based ion acceleration using freely suspended liquid\ncrystal film targets, formed with thicknesses varying from 100 $nm$ to 2 $\\mu\nm$ for this experiment. Optimization of Target Normal Sheath Acceleration\n(TNSA) of protons is shown using a 1 $\\times$ $10^{20}$ $W/cm^2$, 30 fs laser\nwith intensity contrast better than $10^{-7}:1$. The optimum thickness was near\n700 $nm$, resulting in a proton energy maximum of 24 $MeV$. Radiochromic film\n(RCF) was employed on both the laser and target normal axes, revealing minimal\nlaser axis signal but a striking ring distribution in the low energy target\nnormal ion signature that varies with liquid crystal thickness. Discussion of\nthis phenomenon and a comparison to similar observations on other laser systems\nis included.\n", "  We consider the interquark potential in the one-gluon-exchange (OGE)\napproximation, using a fully nonperturbative gluon propagator from large-volume\nlattice simulations. The resulting VLGP potential is non-confining, showing\nthat the OGE approximation is not sufficient to describe the infrared sector of\nQCD. Nevertheless, it represents an improvement over the perturbative\n(Coulomb-like) potential, since it allows the description of a few low-lying\nbound states of charmonium and bottomonium. In order to achieve a better\ndescription of these spectra, we add to VLGP a linearly growing term. The\nobtained results are comparable to the corresponding ones in the\nCornell-potential case. As a byproduct of our study, we estimate the interquark\ndistance for the considered charmonium and bottomonium states.\n", "  Since the invention of the atomic force microscope (AFM) in 1986, there has\nbeen a drive to apply this scanning probe technique or a form of this technique\nto various disciplines in nanoscale science. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) is\na member of a growing family of scanning probe methods and has been widely used\nfor the study of magnetic materials. In MFM a magnetic probe is used to\nraster-scan the surface of the sample, of which its magnetic field interacts\nwith the magnetic tip to offer insight into its magnetic properties. This\nreview will focus on the use of MFM in relation to nanoparticle\ncharacterization, including superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles,\ncovering MFM imaging in air and in liquid environments.\n", "  In the standard DNA brick set-up, distinct 32-nucleotide strands of\nsingle-stranded DNA are each designed to bind specifically to four other such\nmolecules. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that the overall yield is\nincreased if certain bricks which occur on the outer faces of target structures\nare merged with adjacent bricks. However, it is not well understood by what\nmechanism such `boundary bricks' increase the yield, as they likely influence\nboth the nucleation process and the final stability of the target structure.\nHere, we use Monte Carlo simulations with a patchy particle model of DNA bricks\nto investigate the role of boundary bricks in the self-assembly of complex\nmulticomponent target structures. We demonstrate that boundary bricks lower the\nfree-energy barrier to nucleation and that boundary bricks on edges stabilize\nthe final structure. However, boundary bricks are also more prone to\naggregation, as they can stabilize partially assembled intermediates. We\nexplore some design strategies that permit us to benefit from the stabilizing\nrole of boundary bricks whilst minimizing their ability to hinder assembly; in\nparticular, we show that maximizing the total number of boundary bricks is not\nan optimal strategy.\n", "  In the present work the instability of a flat horizontal thin layer of a\nmagnetic fluid (the depth of no more than 50 \\mum) under the action of a\nuniform magnetic field is studied experimentally. It was revealed that the\ndevelopment of instability under the action of tilted magnetic field can lead\nto the formation of parallel ridges on a fluid surface; the ridges undergo a\ntransformation into hexagonal system of conical peaks with the magnetic field\nincreasing. The necessary conditions for the formation of these surface\npatterns are studied. It was found that the development of instability of quite\nthin layers may result in layers breakup. The dependencies of instability wave\nnumber on the system physical parameters are obtained. The time for the\ndevelopment of instability is measured. The experimental results are compared\nwith the existing theory and discussed.\n", "  Around year 2000 the centenary of Planck's thermal radiation formula awakened\ninterest in the origins of quantum theory, traditionally traced back to the\nPlanck's conference on 14 December 1900 at the Berlin Academy of Sciences. A\nlot of more accurate historical reconstructions, conducted under the stimulus\nof that recurrence, placed the birth date of quantum theory in March 1905 when\nEinstein advanced his light quantum hypothesis. Both interpretations are yet\ncontroversial, but science historians agree on one point: the emergence of\nquantum theory from a presumed \"crisis\" of classical physics is a myth with\nscarce adherence to the historical truth. This article, written in Italian\nlanguage, was originally presented in connection with the celebration of the\nWorld Year of Phyics 2005 with the aim of bringing these scholarly theses to a\nwider audience.\n  ---\n  Tradizionalmente la nascita della teoria quantistica viene fatta risalire al\n14 dicembre 1900, quando Planck present\\`o all'Accademia delle Scienze di\nBerlino la dimostrazione della formula della radiazione termica. Numerose\nricostruzioni storiche pi\\`u accurate, effettuate nel periodo intorno al 2000\nsotto lo stimolo dell'interesse per il centenario di quell'avvenimento,\ncollocano invece la nascita della teoria quantistica nel marzo del 1905, quando\nEinstein avanz\\`o l'ipotesi dei quanti di luce. Entrambe le interpretazioni\nsono tuttora controverse, ma gli storici della scienza concordano su un punto:\nl'emergere della teoria quantistica da una presunta \"crisi\" della fisica\nclassica \\`e un mito con scarsa aderenza alla verit\\`a storica. Con questo\narticolo in italiano, presentato originariamente in occasione delle\ncelebrazioni per il World Year of Phyics 2005, si \\`e inteso portare a un pi\\`u\nlargo pubblico queste tesi gi\\`a ben note agli specialisti.\n", "  The capillary flow of a ferrofluid in a single cylindrical capillary tube and\nthrough a sandy porous medium under the action of a non-uniform magnetic field\nis studied experimentally. The dynamics of the capillary rise and the static\ncase have been considered. It has been shown that the non-uniform magnetic\nfield with upward directed gradient accelerates the capillary rise; contrary,\nthe non-uniform magnetic field with downward directed gradient decelerates the\ncapillary rise. Time dependences of the ferrofluid height and maximum reachable\nheight of ferrofluid have been analyzed. The method of the study of ferrofluid\ncapillary rise based on the use of magnetic measurements has been proposed. It\nhas been demonstrated that porous material parameters can be extracted from the\nresults of measurements of the inductances of the solenoid with porous medium\ninside and the small sensing coil within a single experiment.\n", "  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no\ncure and limited treatment solutions that are unable to target any of the\nsuspected causes. Increasing evidence suggests that one of the causes of\nneurodegeneration is the overproduction of amyloid beta (A\\b{eta}) and the\ninability of A\\b{eta} peptides to be cleared from the brain, resulting in\nself-aggregation to form toxic oligomers, fibrils and plaques. One of the\npotential treatment options is to target A\\b{eta} and prevent self-aggregation\nto allow for a natural clearing of the brain. In this paper, we review the\ndrugs and drug delivery systems that target A\\b{eta} in relation to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Many attempts have been made to use anti-A\\b{eta} targeting molecules\ncapable of targeting A\\b{eta} (with much success in vitro and in vivo animal\nmodels), but the major obstacle to this technique is the challenge posed by the\nblood brain barrier (BBB). This highly selective barrier protects the brain\nfrom toxic molecules and pathogens and prevents the delivery of most drugs.\nTherefore novel A\\b{eta} aggregation inhibitor drugs will require well\nthought-out drug delivery systems to deliver sufficient concentrations to the\nbrain.\n", "  Metal ions, including copper and zinc, have been implicated in the\npathogenesis of Alzheimers disease through a variety of mechanisms including\nincreased amyloid \\b{eta} affinity and redox effects. Recent reports have\ndemonstrated that the amyloid \\b{eta} monomer does not necessarily travel\nthrough a definitive intermediary en-route to a stable amyloid fibril\nstructure. Rather, amyloid \\b{eta} misfolding may follow a variety of pathways\nresulting in a fibrillar end-product or a variety of oligomeric end-products\nwith a diversity of structures and sizes. The presence of metal ions has been\ndemonstrated to alter the kinetic pathway of the amyloid \\b{eta} peptide which\nmay lead to more toxic oligomeric end-products. In this work, we review the\ncontemporary literature supporting the hypothesis that metal ions alter the\nreaction pathway of amyloid \\b{eta} misfolding leading to more neurotoxic\nspecies.\n", "  Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), due to their\ncontrollable sizes, relatively long in vivo half-life and limited\nagglomeration, are ideal for biomedical applications such as magnetic labeling,\nhyperthermia cancer treatment, targeted drug delivery and for magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) as contrast enhancement agents. In order to understand\nhow SPIONs interact with cells and cellular membranes it would be of interest\nto characterize individual SPIONs at the nanoscale in physiologically relevant\nconditions without labeling them. We demonstrate that Magnetic Force Microscopy\n(MFM) can be used to image SPIONs in air as well as in liquid. The magnetic\nproperties of bare and SiO2 coated SPIONs are compared using MFM. We report\nthat surface modification using (3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane\nsignificantly improves adsorption and distribution of SPIONs on gold surfaces.\nTo obtain proof of principle that SPIONS can be imaged with MFM inside the cell\nwe imaged SPIONs buried in thin polymer films (polystyrene (PS) and poly\nmethyl-methacrylate (PMMA)). This opens the possibility of visualizing SPIONs\ninside the cell without any labeling or modifications and present MFM as a\npotential magnetic analogue for fluorescence microscopy. The results of these\nstudies may have a valuable impact for characterization and further development\nof biomedical applications of SPIONs and other magnetic nanoparticles.\n", "  The link between metals, Alzheimers disease (AD) and its implicated protein,\namyloid \\b{eta} (A\\b{eta}), is complex and highly studied. AD is believed to\noccur as a result of the misfolding and aggregation of A\\b{eta}. The\ndyshomeostasis of metal ions and their propensity to interact with A\\b{eta} has\nalso been implicated in AD. In this work, we use single molecule atomic force\nspectroscopy to measure the rupture force required to dissociate two A\\b{eta}\n(1 42) peptides in the presence of copper ions, Cu2+. In addition, we use\natomic force microscopy to resolve the aggregation of A\\b{eta} formed. Previous\nresearch has shown that metal ions decrease the lag time associated with\nA\\b{eta} aggregation. We show that with the addition of copper ions the\nunbinding force increases notably. This suggests that the reduction of lag time\nassociated with A\\b{eta} aggregation occurs on a single molecule level as a\nresult of an increase in binding forces during the very initial interactions\nbetween two A\\b{eta} peptides. We attribute these results to copper ions acting\nas a bridge between the two peptide molecules, increasing the stability of the\npeptide-peptide complex.\n", "  Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) we investigated the interaction of\namyloid beta (Ab) (1 42) peptide with chemically modified surfaces in order to\nbetter understand the mechanism of amyloid toxicity, which involves interaction\nof amyloid with cell membrane surfaces. We compared the structure and density\nof Ab fibrils on positively and negatively charged as well as hydrophobic\nchemically modified surfaces at physiologically relevant conditions.\n", "  Thiol self assembled monolayers (SAMs) are widely used in many nano- and\nbio-technology applications. We report a new approach to create and\ncharacterize a thiol SAMs micropattern with alternating charges on a flat\ngoldcoated substrate using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force\nmicroscopy (KPFM). We produced SAMs patterns made of alternating positively\ncharged, negatively charged, and hydrophobic terminated thiols by an automated\nAFM assisted manipulation, or nanografting. We show that these thiol patterns\npossess only small topographical differences as revealed by AFM, and\ndistinguished differences in surface potential (20 to 50 mV), revealed by KPFM.\nThe pattern can be helpful in the development of biosensor technologies,\nspecifically for selective binding of biomolecules based on charge and\nhydrophobicity, and serve as a model for creating surfaces with quantified\nalternating surface potential distribution.\n", "  Stress-induced glucocorticoid elevation is a highly conserved response among\nvertebrates. This facilitates stress adaptation and the mode of action involves\nactivation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor leading to the\nmodulation of target gene expression. However, this genomic effect is slow\nacting and, therefore, a role for glucocorticoid in the rapid response to\nstress is unclear. Here we show that stress levels of cortisol, the primary\nglucocorticoid in teleosts, rapidly fluidizes rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus\nmykiss) liver plasma membranes in vitro. This involved incorporation of the\nsteroid into the lipid domains, as cortisol coupled to a membrane impermeable\npeptide moiety, did not affect membrane order. Studies confirmed that cortisol,\nbut not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane fluidity. Atomic force\nmicroscopy revealed cortisol mediated changes to membrane surface topography\nand viscoelasticity confirming changes to membrane order. Treating trout\nhepatocytes with stress levels of cortisol led to the modulation of cell\nsignaling pathways, including the phosphorylation status of putative PKA, PKC\nand AKT substrate proteins within 10 minutes. The phosphorylation by protein\nkinases in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with benzyl\nalcohol, a known membrane fluidizer. Our results suggest that biophysical\nchanges to plasma membrane properties, triggered by stressor induced\nglucocorticoid elevation, act as a nonspecific stress response and may rapidly\nmodulate acute stress-signaling pathways.\n", "  We propose a new mechanism of baryogenesis which proceeds via a CP-violating\nphase transition. During this phase transition, the coupling of the Weinberg\noperator is dynamically realised and subsequently a lepton asymmetry is\ngenerated via the non-zero interference of this operator at different times.\nThis new scenario of leptogenesis provides a direct connection between the\nbaryon asymmetry, low energy neutrino parameters and leptonic flavour models.\n", "  Neutral metal-containing molecules and clusters present a particular\nchallenge to velocity map imaging techniques. Common methods of choice for\nproducing such species such as laser ablation or magnetron sputtering typically\ngenerate a wide variety of metal-containing species and, without the\npossibility of mass-selection, even determining the identity of the\ndissociating moiety can be challenging. In recent years, we have developed a\nvelocity map imaging spectrometer equipped with a laser ablation source\nexplicitly for studying neutral metal-containing species. Here, we report the\nresults of velocity map imaging photofragmentation studies of MoO and CrO. In\nboth cases, dissociation at the two- and three-photon level leads to\nfragmentation into a range of product channels, some of which can be\nconfidently assigned to particular Mo (Cr) and O atom quantum states. Analysis\nof the kinetic energy release spectra as a function of photon energy allows\nprecise determination of the ground state dissociation energies of\nMoO,respectively.\n", "  After reviewing the key features of the global electroweak fit, I will\nprovide updated results and offer experimental and theoretical contexts. I will\nalso make the case for greater precision and highlight future directions.\n", "  Within an artificial neural network (ANN) approach, we classify simulated\nsignals corresponding to the semi-classical description of Bloch oscillations\non a two-dimensional square lattice. After the ANN is properly trained, we\nconsider the inverse problem of Bloch oscillations (BO) in which a new signal\nis classified according to the lattice spacing and external electric field\nstrength oriented along a particular direction of the lattice with an accuracy\nof 96%. This approach can be improved depending on the time spent in training\nthe network and the computational power available. This work is one of the\nfirst efforts for analyzing the BO with ANN in two-dimensional crystals.\n", "  Among the large number of promising two-dimensional (2D) atomic layer\ncrystals, true metallic layers are rare. Through combined theoretical and\nexperimental approaches, we report on the stability and successful exfoliation\nof atomically thin gallenene sheets, having two distinct atomic arrangements\nalong crystallographic twin directions of the parent alpha-gallium. Utilizing\nthe weak interface between solid and molten phases of gallium, a solid-melt\ninterface exfoliation technique is developed to extract these layers. Phonon\ndispersion calculations show that gallenene can be stabilized with bulk gallium\nlattice parameters. The electronic band structure of gallenene shows a\ncombination of partially filled Dirac cone and the non-linear dispersive band\nnear Fermi level suggesting that gallenene should behave as a metallic layer.\nFurthermore it is observed that strong interaction of gallenene with other 2D\nsemiconductors induces semiconducting to metallic phase transitions in the\nlatter paving the way for using gallenene as interesting metallic contacts in\n2D devices.\n", "  A long standing postulate in crystal plasticity of metals is that yielding\ncommences once the resolved shear stress on a slip plane reaches a critical\nvalue. This assumption, known as Schmid law, implies that the onset of\nplasticity is independent of the normal stress acting on the slip plane. We\nexamine the validity of this assumption in single crystal perfect lattices at\nzero temperature by subjecting them to a wide range of combined normal and\nshear stresses and identifying the onset of plasticity. We employ phonon\nstability analysis on four distinct single crystal metals and identify the\nonset of plasticity with the onset of an instability. Our results show\nsignificant dependence of yielding on the normal stress, thereby illustrating\nthe necessity of considering non-Schmid effects in crystal plasticity. Finally,\ncontrary to the common assumption that instabilities in single crystals are of\nlong wavelength type, we show that short wavelength instabilities are abundant\nin the nucleation of defects for a wide range of loading conditions.\n", "  By combining confocal microscopy and Stress Assessment from Local Structural\nAnisotropy (SALSA), we directly measure stresses in 3D quiescent colloidal\nliquids. Our non-invasive and non-perturbative method allows us to measure\nforces $\\lesssim$ 50 fN with a small and tunable probing volume, enabling us to\nresolve the stress fluctuations arising from particle thermal motions. We use\nthe Green-Kubo relation to relate these measured stress fluctuations to the\nbulk Brownian viscosity at different volume fractions and comparing against\nsimulations and conventional rheometry measurements. We demonstrate that the\nGreen-Kubo analysis gives excellent agreement with these prior results. This\nagreement provides a strong demonstration of the applicability of the\nGreen-Kubo relation in nearly hard-sphere suspensions and opens the door to\ninvestigations of local flow properties in many poorly understood\nfar-from-equilibrium systems, including suspensions that are glassy,\nstrongly-sheared, or highly-confined.\n", "  In this work, we examine the entropy emission property of black holes. When\nthe greybody factor is considered, it is found that Schwarzschild black hole is\na one-dimensional entropy emitter, which is independent of the spacetime\ndimension and the spin of the emitted quanta. However, when generalized to\nother black holes with two or more parameters, the result shows that the\none-dimensional entropy emission property will be violated. Thus our result\nimplies that not all black holes behave as one-dimensional entropy emitters.\n", "  A hard difficulty in Astrobiology is the precise definition of what life is.\nAll living beings have a cellular structure, so it is not possible to have a\nbroader concept of life hence the search for extraterrestrial life is\nrestricted to extraterrestrial cells. Earth is an astronomical rarity because\nit is difficult for a planet to present liquid water on the surface. Two\nantagonistic bioethical principles arise: planetary protection and\nterraforming. Planetary protection is based on the fear of interplanetary\ncross-infection and possible ecological damages caused by alien living beings.\nTerraforming is the intention of modifying the environmental conditions of the\nneighbouring planets in such a way that human colonisation would be possible.\nThe synthesis of this antagonism is ecopoiesis, a concept related to the\ncreation of new ecosystems in other planets. Since all the multicellular\nbiodiversity requires oxygen to survive, only extremophile microorganisms could\nsurvive in other planets. So, it could be carried out a simulation of a\nmeteorite by taking to other planets portions of the terrestrial permafrost, or\nocean or soil, so that if a single species could grow, a new ecosystem would\nstart, as well as a new Natural History. As a conclusion, ecopoiesis should be\nthe bioethical principle to guide practices and research in Astrobiology.\n", "  The first-order and the second-order wave generation theory is studied in\nthis paper. The theory is based on the fully nonlinear water wave equations.\nThe nonlinear boundary value problem (BVP) is solved using a series expansion\nmethod. Using this method, the problem becomes a set of linear, signalling\nproblems according to the expansion order. The first-order theory leads to a\nhomogeneous BVP. It is a system with the first-order steering of the wavemaker\nmotion as input and the surface wave field with propagating and evanescent\nmodes as output. The second-order theory leads to a nonhomogeneous BVP. It is a\nsystem where the second-order steering of the wavemaker motion is prescribed in\nsuch a way that the second-order part of the surface elevation far from the\nwavemaker contains only the bound wave component and the free wave component\nvanishes. The second-order surface wave elevation consists of a superposition\nof bichromatic frequencies.\n", "  Proposal to develop an Improved immunological assay employing primary IgG\nantibodies and secondary IgM antibodies labeled with quantum dots to amplify\nantigen detection.\n", "  To date, the Hubbard model and its strong coupling limit, the t-J model,\nserve as the canonical model for strongly correlated electron systems in\nsolids. Approximating the Coulomb interaction by only the on-site term (Hubbard\nU-term), however, may not be sufficient to describe the essential physics of\ninteracting electron systems. We develop a more complete model in which all the\nnext leading order terms besides the on-site term are retained. Moreover, we\ndiscuss how the inclusion of these neglected interaction terms in the Hubbard\nmodel changes the t-J model.\n", "  In 1990, Germany began the reunification of two separate research systems. In\nthis study, we explore the factors predicting the East-West integration of\nacademic fields by examining the evolution of Germany's co-authorship network\nbetween 1974 and 2014. We find that the unification of the German research\nnetwork accelerated rapidly during the 1990s, but then stagnated at an\nintermediate level of integration. We then study the integration of the 20\nlargest academic fields (by number of publications prior to 1990), finding an\ninverted U-shaped relationship between each field's East or West \"dominance\" (a\nmeasure of the East-West concentration of a field's scholarly output prior to\n1990) and the fields' subsequent level of integration. We checked for the\nrobustness of these results by running Monte Carlo simulations and a\ndifferences-in-differences analysis. Both methods confirmed that fields that\nwere dominated by either West or East Germany prior to reunification integrated\nless than those whose output was balanced. Finally, we explored the origins of\nthis inverted U-shaped relationship by considering the tendency of scholars\nfrom a given field to collaborate with scholars from similarly productive\nregions. These results shed light on the mechanisms governing the reintegration\nof research networks that were separated by institutions.\n", "  The properties of giant and pygmy resonances are calculated starting from\nchiral two-and three-nucleon interactions. The aim is to assess the predictive\npower of modern Hamiltonians and especially the role of the three-nucleon\nforce. Methods based on the random-phase approximation (RPA) provide an optimal\ndescription of the modes of interest with minimal computational requirements.\nHere we discuss the giant resonances (GRs) of 40,48Ca isotopes and their\nlow-energy dipole response. A comparison with previous results obtained with a\ntransformed Argonne V18 two-nucleon potential points to certain improvements.\n", "  We estimated the ortho-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} abundances of G267.9--1.1, G268.4--0.9,\nG333.1--0.4 and G336.5--1.5, four of the brightest ortho-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} sources\nin the southern sky observed by the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite\n(ortho-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} 1$_{10}$ -- 1$_{01}$ line, 556.936~GHz). The typical\nmolecular clumps in our sample have H$_2$ column densities of $10 ^{22}$ to $10\n^{23}${\\,}cm$^{-2}$ and ortho-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} abundances of 10$^{-10}$. Compared\nwith previous studies, the ortho-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} abundances are at a low level,\nwhich can be caused by the low temperatures of these clumps. To estimate the\northo-{\\rm{H$_2$O}} abundances, we used the CS $J = 2 \\to 1$ line\n(97.98095~GHz) and CS $J = 5 \\to 4$ (244.93556~GHz) line observed by{ the}\nSwedish-ESO 15\\,m Submillimeter Telescope (SEST) to calculate the temperatures\nof the clumps and the 350~$\\upmu$m dust continuum observed by{ the} Caltech\nSubmillimeter Observatory (CSO) telescope to estimate the H$_2$ column\ndensities. The observations of {\\rm{N$_2$H$^+$}} ($J = 1 \\to 0$) for these\nclumps were also acquired by SEST and the corresponding abundances were\nestimated. The {\\rm{N$_2$H$^+$}} abundance in each clump shows a common\ndecreasing trend toward the center and {a} typical abundance range from\n10$^{-11}$ to 10$^{-9}$.\n", "  The magnetic moment and magnetic polarisability of the neutron and proton are\ninvestigated using the uniform background-field method and lattice QCD. The\nresults are calculated using 32^3 x 64 dynamical QCD lattices provided by the\nPACS-CS collaboration through the ILDG. Methods of isolating the energy of the\nhadrons accounting for Landau level energies are explored. Effective energy\nshifts are formed from combinations of correlation functions and their\nefficiency in isolating the magnetic moment and polarisability terms is\ndetermined.\n", "  The ammonium halides present an interesting system for study in view of their\npolymorphism and the possible internal rotation of the ammonium ion. The static\nproperties of the mixed ionic crystal NH$_4$Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$ have been recently\ninvestigated, using three-body potential model (TDPM) by the application of\nVegard's law. Here, by using a simple theoretical model, we estimate the bulk\nmodulus of their ternary alloys NH$_4$Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$, in terms of the bulk\nmodulus of the end members alone. The calculated values are comparable to those\ndeduced from the three-body potential model (TDPM) by the application of\nVegard's law.\n", "  C60-functionalized tips are used to probe C60 molecules on Cu(111) with\nscanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy. Distinct and complex\nintramolecular contrasts are found. Maximal attractive forces are observed when\nfor both molecules a [6,6] bond faces a hexagon of the other molecule. Density\nfunctional theory calculations including parameterized van der Waals\ninteractions corroborate the observations.\n", "  III-V nanostructures have the potential to revolutionize optoelectronics and\nenergy harvesting. For this to become a reality, critical issues such as\nreproducibility and sensitivity to defects should be resolved. By discussing\nthe optical properties of MBE grown GaAs nanomembranes we highlight several\nfeatures that bring them closer to large scale applications. Uncapped membranes\nexhibit a very high optical quality, expressed by extremely narrow neutral\nexciton emission, allowing the resolution of the more complex excitonic\nstructure for the first time. Capping of the membranes with an AlGaAs shell\nresults in a strong increase of emission intensity but also to a shift and\nbroadening of the exciton peak. This is attributed to the existence of\nimpurities in the shell, beyond MBE-grade quality, showing the high sensitivity\nof these structures to the presence of impurities. Finally, emission properties\nare identical at the sub-micron and sub-millimeter scale, demonstrating the\npotential of these structures for large scale applications.\n", "  We define the Abelian distribution and study its basic properties. Abelian\ndistributions arise in the context of neural modeling and describe the size of\nneural avalanches in fully-connected integrate-and-fire models of\nself-organized criticality in neural systems.\n", "  ATHENA, with a launch foreseen in 2028 towards the L2 orbit, addresses the\nscience theme \"The Hot and Energetic Universe\", coupling a high-performance\nX-ray Telescope with two complementary focal-plane instruments. One of these,\nthe X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is a TES based kilo-pixel array providing\nspatially resolved high-resolution spectroscopy (2.5 eV at 6 keV) over a 5\narcmin FoV. The background for this kind of detectors accounts for several\ncomponents: the diffuse Cosmic X-ray Background, the low energy particles\n(<~100 keV) focalized by the mirrors and reaching the detector from inside the\nfield of view, and the high energy particles (>~100 MeV) crossing the\nspacecraft and reaching the focal plane from every direction. Each one of these\ncomponents is under study to reduce their impact on the instrumental\nperformances. This task is particularly challenging, given the lack of data on\nthe background of X-ray detectors in L2, the uncertainties on the particle\nenvironment to be expected in such orbit, and the reliability of the models\nused in the Monte Carlo background computations. As a consequence, the\nactivities addressed by the group range from the reanalysis of the data of\nprevious missions like XMM-Newton, to the characterization of the L2\nenvironment by data analysis of the particle monitors onboard of satellites\npresent in the Earth magnetotail, to the characterization of solar events and\ntheir occurrence, and to the validation of the physical models involved in the\nMonte Carlo simulations. All these activities will allow to develop a set of\nreliable simulations to predict, analyze and find effective solutions to reduce\nthe particle background experienced by the X-IFU, ultimately satisfying the\nscientific requirement that enables the science of ATHENA. While the activities\nare still ongoing, we present here some preliminary results already obtained by\nthe group.\n", "  The Gr\\\"uneisen parameter is evaluated for three-dimensional Yukawa systems\nin the strongly coupled regime. Simple analytical expression is derived from\nthe thermodynamic consideration and its structure is analysed in detail.\nPossible applications are briefly discussed.\n", "  I describe how the TNT2K (Tokai and Toyama to Kamioka) configuration with a\nmuon decay at rest ($\\mu$DAR) add-on to T2(H)K can achieve better measurement\nof the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\\delta_D$. It has five-fold advantages of high\nefficiency, smaller CP uncertainty, absence of degeneracy, as well as\nguaranteeing CP sensitivity against non-unitary mixing (NUM) and non-standard\ninteraction (NSI). In comparison to the flux upgrade with T2K-II, the detector\nupgrade with T2HK, and the baseline upgrade with T2HKK, TNT2K is a totally\ndifferent concept with spectrum upgrade to solve the intrinsic problems in\ncurrent and next generations of CP measurement experiments. With a single\n$\\mu$DAR source, TNT2K is much cheaper and technically much easier than the\nDAE$\\delta$ALUS proposal. The latter needs three sources that cannot run\nsimultaneously and consequently requires much higher fluxes. The single\n$\\mu$DAR source at TNT2K also allows a single near detector ($\\mu$Near) to\nfully utilize the neutrino flux for the purpose of constraining NUM, but this\nis impossible at DAE$\\delta$ALUS with three spatially separated sources.\n", "  A possible diagnostic is proposed which may be used to infer the different\nscales underlying the dynamical structure of hadronic resonances using the\nphenomenon of Schottky anomaly.\n", "  We present examples of the both types of bursts and show their similarities\nand differences. Then for chains of type I bursts a similar model as for\ndrifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in\nthe DPS, the chains of type I bursts can be generated by the fragmented\nmagnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this\nnew model of chains of type I bursts, we present an effect of merging of two\nplasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can\nalso explain the \"wavy\" appearance of some chains of type I bursts. Then we\nshow that the chains of type I bursts with the \"wavy\" appearance can be used\nfor estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that\ndifferences of chains of type I bursts and DPSs are mainly owing to different\nregimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case of chains of type\nI bursts the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the\nquasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated\nregime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive\nflares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current\nsheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this\nmagnetic reconnection.\n", "  Several new generation experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay (0vbb) have become operational over the last five years. This report\nsummarizes the present status of the experimental search and discusses\npeculiarities, challenges and reached half-life limits/sensitivities in these\nexperiments. So far, no evidence for 0vbb has been found. Starting from the\ncurrent situation, the paper addresses the question whether an experiment alone\nwill be able to proof unambiguously 0vbb decay and which would be the\nkey-requirements to succeed in this.\n", "  A superbubble which advances in a symmetric Navarro--Frenk--White density\nprofile or in an auto-gravitating density profile generates a thick shell with\na radius that can reach 10 kpc. The application of the symmetric and asymmetric\nimage theory to this thick 3D shell produces a ring in the 2D map of intensity\nand a characteristic `U' shape in the case of 1D cut of the intensity. A\ncomparison of such a ring originating from a superbubble is made with the\nEinstein's ring. A Taylor approximation of order 10 for the angular diameter\ndistance is derived in order to deal with high values of the redshift.\n", "  We release fastNLO tables with NNLO QCD top-quark pair differential\ndistributions corresponding to 8 TeV ATLAS [Eur. Phys. J. C 76 538 (2016)] and\nCMS [Eur. Phys. J. C 75 542 (2015)] measurements. This is the first time\nfastNLO tables with NNLO QCD accuracy have been made publicly available. The\ntables are indispensable in pdf fits and allow, for the first time, very fast\ncalculation of differential distributions with any pdf set and for different\nvalues of $\\alpha_s$. The numerical accuracy of the resulting differential\ndistributions is high and comparable to the accuracy of all publicly available\nNNLO top-quark differential calculations. We intend to keep producing tables\ncorresponding to existing and future LHC measurements at various collider\nenergies.\n", "  We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the general\nthree-component nonlinear Schrodinger (gtc-NLS) equation with a 4x4 Lax pair on\na finite interval by extending the Fokas unified approach. The solutions of the\ngtc-NLS equation can be expressed in terms of the solutions of a 4x4 matrix\nRiemann-Hilbert (RH) problem formulated in the complex k-plane. Moreover, the\nrelevant jump matrices of the RH problem can be explicitly found via the three\nspectral functions arising from the initial data, the Dirichlet-Neumann\nboundary data. The global relation is also established to deduce two distinct\nbut equivalent types of representations (i.e., one by using the large k of\nasymptotics of the eigenfunctions and another one in terms of the\nGelfand-Levitan-Marchenko (GLM) method) for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary\nvalue problems. Moreover, the relevant formulae for boundary value problems on\nthe finite interval can reduce to ones on the half-line as the length of the\ninterval approaches to infinity. Finally, we also give the linearizable\nboundary conditions for the GLM representation.\n", "  When supersymmetry is spontaneously broken it will be generically\nnon-linearly realized. A method to describe the non-linear realization of\nsupersymmetry is with constrained superfields. We discuss the basic features of\nthis description and review some recent developments in supergravity.\n", "  Possible existence of deeply bound kaonic nuclear systems was proposed\nAkaishi and Yamazaki (2002} more than a decade ago, based on an ansatz that the\nLambda* = Lambda(1405) mass is 1405 MeV/c2, where the Lambda* is a Kbar-N\nquasi-bound state decaying to Sigma-pi. Recently, a large number of data on\nphoto-production of Lambda(1405) in the gamma p to K+ pi{0+-} Sigma{0-+}\nreaction were provided by the CLAS collaboration Moriya et al.(2013}, and\ndouble-pole structure of the Lambda* has been intensively discussed by chiral\ndynamics analyses {Roca (2013),Mai 2015}, whereas we show that a Lambda* mass\nof 1405 MeV/c2 is deduced from the same CLAS data.\n", "  I give an overview of recent progress in the simulation of final states\ninvolving top-quarks and vector bosons pair. First I'll discuss the recently\nfound solutions needed to simulate fully differential top pair production\n($pp\\to b\\bar{b}$ + 4 leptons) at NLO+PS accuracy, retaining off-shellness and\ninterference effects exactly. In the second part, I'll review the MiNLO\n(Multi-scale Improved NLO) method, and then show a recent application, namely\nthe simultaneous NLO+PS description of $W^+W^-$ and $W^+W^- +$ 1 jet\nproduction.\n", "  A Reply to \"Comment on `Finding the $0^{--}$ Glueball' \" [arXiv:1702.06634]\nand comment on `Is the exotic $0^{--}$ glueball a pure gluon state?'\n[arXiv:1611.08698]\n", "  A novel approach to calibrate the sensitivity of a differential thermometer,\nconsisting of several thermocouples connected in series (thermopile), has been\ndeveloped. The goal of this method is to increase the accuracy of small\ntemperature difference measurements ($\\Delta T \\leq 1\\:\\textrm{K}$), without\ninvoking higher sensor complexity. To this end, a method to determine the\noptimal temperature difference employed during the differential measurement of\nthermoelectric sensitivities has been developed. This calibration temperature\ndifference is found at the minimum of combined measurement and linearization\nerror for a given mean temperature. The developed procedure is demonstrated in\nan illustrative example calibration of a nine-junction thermopile. For mean\ntemperatures between $-10\\:^{o}\\textrm{C}$ and $15\\:^{o}\\textrm{C}$, the\nthermoelectric sensitivity was measured with an uncertainty of less than $\\pm\n2\\:\\%$. Subsequently, temperature differences as low as $10^{-2}\\:\\textrm{K}$\ncan be resolved, while the thermometer used for the example calibration was\naccurate only to $\\pm 0.3\\:\\textrm{K}$. This and higher degrees of accuracy are\nrequired in certain research applications, for example to detect heat flux\nmodulations in bifurcating fluidic systems.\n", "  We consider a continuous version of the Hegselmann-Krause model of opinion\ndynamics. Interaction between agents either leads to a state of consensus,\nwhere agents converge to a single opinion as time evolves, or to a fragmented\nstate with multiple opinions. In this work, we linearize the system about a\nuniform density solution and predict consensus or fragmentation based on\nproperties of the resulting dispersion relation. This prediction is different\ndepending on whether the initial agent distribution is uniform or nearly\nuniform. In the uniform case, we observe traveling fronts in the agent based\nmodel and make predictions for the speed and pattern selected by this front.\n", "  Using the metric formalism, we study the derivative mixings of spin-2 fields\nin massive bi-Gravity. Necessary (but not sufficient) criteria are given for\nsuch mixings to be ghost free. Examples satisfying those criteria are studied\nand it is shown that in the decoupling limit they host a ghost.\n", "  In this ``Letter'', I do introduce my point of view about the role of science\nin the development and organization of our societies, emphasizing that science\nis too far from our societies. In Brazil we follow a way similarly to that of\nUSA and France concerning this phenomenon, marked by the lack of participation\nof our academies and scientific community in politics and economy, i.e. we can\nsee that strategic decisions are been hold by only electoral bias and, when\nthere is the presence of academic science, usually it is restricted to the\nfields of economical, political and social sciences. I conclude that the\nstrategic planning of a country, or of the planet as a whole, needs that\nacademy stay close of society, been this one necessary both not enough\ncondition to the proper functioning of any democracy. In the Brazil case more\nspecifically, I propose that this political change in our academies begin by\none profound thought about the Brazilian Science with a consequent refoundation\nof the CNPQ (Nacional Council for Science and Technology development).\n", "  Tower of States analysis is a powerful tool for investigating phase\ntransitions in condensed matter systems. Spontaneous symmetry breaking implies\na specific structure of the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding quantum\nnumbers on finite systems. In these lecture notes we explain the group\nrepresentation theory used to derive the spectral structure for several\nscenarios of symmetry breaking. We give numerous examples to compute quantum\nnumbers of the degenerate groundstates, including translational symmetry\nbreaking or spin rotational symmetry breaking in Heisenberg antiferromagnets.\nThese results are then compared to actual numerical data from Exact\nDiagonalization.\n", "  The possibility of the existence of right-handed neutrinos remains one of the\nmost important open questions in particle physics, as they can help elucidate\nthe problems of neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, and dark matter.\nInterest in this topic has been increasing in recent years with the proposal of\nnew experimental avenues by which right-handed neutrinos with masses below the\nelectroweak scale could be detected directly using displaced-vertex signatures.\nAt the forefront of such endeavours, the proposed SHiP proton beam-dump\nexperiment is designed for a large acceptance to new weakly-coupled particles\nand low backgrounds. It is capable of probing right-handed neutrinos with\nmasses below 5~GeV and mixings several orders of magnitude smaller than current\nconstraints, in regions favoured by cosmology. To probe higher masses (up to\n30~GeV), a promising novel approach is to identify displaced vertices from\nright-handed neutrinos produced in $W$ decays at LHC experiments.\n", "  Magnetic dynamo action caused by the magnetorotational instability is studied\nin the shearing-box approximation with no imposed net magnetic flux. Consistent\nwith recent studies, the dynamo action is found to be sensitive to the aspect\nratio of the box: it is much easier to obtain in tall boxes (stretched in the\ndirection normal to the disk plane) than in long boxes (stretched in the radial\ndirection). Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number. To\nexplain the relatively larger effort required to obtain the dynamo action in a\nlong box, we propose that the turbulent eddies caused by the instability most\nefficiently fold and mix the magnetic field lines in the radial direction. As a\nresult, in the long box the scale of the generated strong azimuthal\n(stream-wise directed) magnetic field is always comparable to the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. In contrast, in the tall box the azimuthal magnetic flux\nspreads in the vertical direction over a distance exceeding the scale of the\nturbulent eddies. As a result, different vertical sections of the tall box are\npermeated by large-scale nonzero azimuthal magnetic fluxes, facilitating the\ninstability. In agreement with this picture, the cases when the dynamo is\nefficient are characterized by a strong intermittency of the local azimuthal\nmagnetic fluxes.\n", "  The luminous efficiency of meteors is poorly known, but critical for\ndetermining the meteoroid mass. We present an uncertainty analysis of the\nluminous efficiency as determined by the classical ablation equations, and\nsuggest a possible method for determining the luminous efficiency of real\nmeteor events. We find that a two-term exponential fit to simulated lag data is\nable to reproduce simulated luminous efficiencies reasonably well.\n"]}
