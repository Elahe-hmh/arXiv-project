and $^{60}$Fe (T$_{1/2} = 1.5$ Myr),\nit is often asserted that the Sun was born in a large stellar cluster, where a\nmassive star contaminated the protoplanetary disk with freshly\nnucleosynthesized isotopes from its supernova (SN) explosion. To account for\nthe inferred initial solar system abundances of short-lived radionuclides, this\nsupernova had to be close ($\\sim$ 0.3 pc) to the young ($\\leqslant$ 1 Myr)\nprotoplanetary disk.\n  Here we show that massive star evolution timescales are too long, compared to\ntypical timescales of star formation in embedded clusters, for them to explode\nas supernovae within the lifetimes of nearby disks. This is especially true in\nan Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC)-type of setting, where the most massive star\nwill explode as a supernova $\\sim$ 5 Myr after the onset of star formation,\nwhen nearby disks will have already suffered substantial photoevaporation\nand/or formed large planetesimals.\n  We quantify the probability for {\\it any} protoplanetary disk to receive SRs\nfrom a nearby supernova at the level observed in the early solar system. Key\nconstraints on our estimate are: (1) SRs have to be injected into a newly\nformed ($\\leqslant$ 1 Myr) disk, (2) the disk has to survive UV\nphotoevaporation, and (3) the protoplanetary disk must be situated in an\nenrichment zone permitting SR injection at the solar system level without disk\ndisruption. The probability of protoplanetary disk contamination by a supernova\nejecta is, in the most favorable case, 3 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$.\n", "  The discovery that the short-lived radionucleide iron-60 was present in the\noldest meteorites suggests that the formation of the Earth closely followed the\ndeath of a massive star. I discuss three astrophysical origins: winds from an\nAGB star, injection of supernova ejecta into circumstellar disks, and induced\nstar formation on the boundaries of HII regions. I show that the first two fail\nto match the solar system iron-60 abundance in the vast majority of star\nforming systems. The cores and pillars on the edges of HII regions are\nspectacular but rare sites of star formation and larger clumps with masses\n1e3-1e4 solar masses at tens of parsec from a supernova are a more likely birth\nenvironment for our Sun. I also examine gamma-ray observations of iron-60 decay\nand show that the Galactic background could account for the low end of the\nrange of meteoritic measurements if the massive star formation rate was at\nleast a factor of 2 higher 4.6 Gyr ago.\n", "  The kinetics and microstructure of solid-phase crystallization under\ncontinuous heating conditions and random distribution of nuclei are analyzed.\nAn Arrhenius temperature dependence is assumed for both nucleation and growth\nrates. Under these circumstances, the system has a scaling law such that the\nbehavior of the scaled system is independent of the heating rate. Hence, the\nkinetics and microstructure obtained at different heating rates differ only in\ntime and length scaling factors.Concerning the kinetics, it is shown that the\nextended volume evolves with time according to alpha_ex=[exp(kappa Ct)]^m+1,\nwhere t' is the dimensionless time. This scaled solution not only represents a\nsignificant simplification of the system description, it also provides new\ntools for its analysis. For instance, it has been possible to find an\nanalytical dependence of the final average grain size on kinetic parameters.\nConcerning the microstructure, the existence of a length scaling factor has\nallowed the grain-size distribution to be numerically calculated as a function\nof the kinetic parameters.\n", "  Gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decay of 60Fe provides constraints\non nucleosynthesis in massive stars and supernovae. We detect the gamma-ray\nlines from 60Fe decay at 1173 and 1333 keV using three years of data from the\nspectrometer SPI on board INTEGRAL. The average flux per line is (4.4 \\pm 0.9)\n\\times 10^{-5} ph cm^{-2} s^{-1} rad^{-1} for the inner Galaxy region. Deriving\nthe Galactic 26Al gamma-ray line flux with using the same set of observations\nand analysis method, we determine the flux ratio of 60Fe/26Al gamma-rays as\n0.15 \\pm 0.05. We discuss the implications of these results for the widely-held\nhypothesis that 60Fe is synthesized in core-collapse supernovae, and also for\nthe closely-related question of the precise origin of 26Al in massive stars.\n", "  PSR J1846-0258 is a radio-quiet rotation-powered pulsar at the center of\nSupernova remnant Kes 75. It is the youngest pulsar (~723 year) of all known\npulsars and slows down very predictably since its discovery in 2000. Till June\n7, 2006 very stable behavior has been displayed both in the temporal and\nspectral domains with pulsed emission detectable by INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI and\nRXTE HEXTE up to ~150 keV. Then, a dramatic brightening was detected of the\npulsar during June 7-12, 2006 Chandra observations of Kes 75. This radiative\nevent, lasting for ~55 days, was accompanied by a huge timing glitch, reported\non for the first in present work. Moreover, several short magnetar-like bursts\nwere discovered. In this work not only the time-averaged pre-outburst\nX-ray/soft gamma-ray characteristics are discussed in detail, but also the\nspectral evolution during the outburst and its relaxation phase are addressed\nusing RXTE PCA and HEXTE and INTEGRAL IBIS ISGRI data.\n", "  We report on the investigation of strong radiative shocks generated with the\nhigh energy, sub-nanosecond iodine laser at PALS. These shock waves are\ncharacterized by a developed radiative precursor and their dynamics is analyzed\nover long time scales (~50 ns), approaching a quasi-stationary limit. We\npresent the first preliminary results on the rear side XUV spectroscopy. These\nstudies are relevant to the understanding of the spectroscopic signatures of\naccretion shocks in Classical T Tauri Stars.\n", "  Deformation-induced lateral migration of a bubble slowly rising near a\nvertical plane wall in a stagnant liquid is numerically and theoretically\ninvestigated. In particular, our focus is set on a situation with a short\nclearance $c$ between the bubble interface and the wall. Motivated by the fact\nthat numerically and experimentally measured migration velocities are\nconsiderably higher than the velocity estimated by the available analytical\nsolution using the Fax\\'{e}n mirror image technique for $a/(a+c)\\ll 1$ (here\n$a$ is the bubble radius), when the clearance parameter $\\varepsilon(= c/a)$ is\ncomparable to or smaller than unity, the numerical analysis based on the\nboundary-fitted finite-difference approach solving the Stokes equation is\nperformed to complement the experiment. The migration velocity is found to be\nmore affected by the high-order deformation modes with decreasing\n$\\varepsilon$. The numerical simulations are compared with a theoretical\nmigration velocity obtained from a lubrication study of a nearly spherical\ndrop, which describes the role of the squeezing flow within the bubble-wall\ngap. The numerical and lubrication analyses consistently demonstrate that when\n$\\varepsilon\\leq 1$, the lubrication effect makes the migration velocity\nasymptotically $\\mu V_{B1}^2/(25\\varepsilon \\gamma)$ (here, $V_{B1}$, $\\mu$,\nand $\\gamma$ denote the rising velocity, the dynamic viscosity of liquid, and\nthe surface tension, respectively).\n", "  The complex behavior of drop deposition on a hydrophobic surface is\nconsidered by looking at a model problem in which the evolution of a\nconstant-volume liquid bridge is studied as the bridge is stretched. The bridge\nis pinned with a fixed diameter at the upper contact point, but the contact\nline at the lower attachment point is free to move on a smooth substrate.\nExperiments indicate that initially, as the bridge is stretched, the lower\ncontact line slowly retreats inwards. However at a critical radius, the bridge\nbecomes unstable, and the contact line accelerates dramatically, moving inwards\nvery quickly. The bridge subsequently pinches off, and a small droplet is left\non the substrate. A quasi-static analysis, using the Young-Laplace equation, is\nused to accurately predict the shape of the bridge during the initial bridge\nevolution, including the initial onset of the slow contact line retraction. A\nstability analysis is used to predict the onset of pinch-off, and a\none-dimensional dynamical equation, coupled with a Tanner-law for the dynamic\ncontact angle, is used to model the rapid pinch-off behavior. Excellent\nagreement between numerical predictions and experiments is found throughout the\nbridge evolution, and the importance of the dynamic contact line model is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  Luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) can absorb large-area incident sunlight,\nthen emit luminescence with high quantum efficiency, which finally be collected\nby a small photovoltaic (PV) system. The light-harvesting area of the PV system\nis much smaller than that of the LSC system, potentially improving the\nefficiency and reducing the cost of solar cells. Here, based on Fermi-golden\nrule, we present a theoretical description of the luminescent process in\nnanoscale LSCs where the conventional ray-optics model is no longer applicable.\nAs an example calculated with this new model, we demonstrate that a slot\nwaveguide consisting of a nanometer-sized low-index slot region sandwiched by\ntwo high-index regions provides a broadband enhancement of light harvesting by\nthe luminescent centers in the slot region. This is because the slot waveguide\ncan (1) greatly enhance the spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect, (2)\ndramatically increase the effective absorption cross-section of luminescent\ncenters, and (3) strongly improve the quantum efficiency of luminescent\ncenters. It is found that about 80% solar photons can be ultimately converted\nto waveguide-coupled luminescent photons even for a low luminescent quantum\nefficiency of 0.5. This LSC is potential to construct a tandem structure which\ncan absorb nearly full-spectrum solar photons, and also may be of special\ninterest for building integrated nano-PV applications.\n", "  It has been argued that cellphones are safe because a single microwave photon\ndoes not have enough energy to break a chemical bond. We show that cellphone\ntechnology operates in the classical wave limit, not the single photon limit.\nBased on energy densities relative to thermal energy, we estimate thresholds at\nwhich effects might be expected. These seem to correspond somewhat with many\nexperimental observations.\n  Revised with appendix responding to critique published by B. Leikind.\n", "  The influence of initial heat treatment on anomalous Cr precipitation within\nhigh temperature solubility region in Fe-9Cr alloy has been investigated using\npositron lifetime studies. Air-quenched samples with pre-existing dislocations\nexhibited a distinct annealing stage in positron lifetime between 800 and 1100\nK corresponding to Cr-precipitation. During this stage, Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy showed fine precipitates of average size 4 nm, dispersed throughout\nthe sample and from EDS analysis they are found to be Cr-enriched. The\nexistence of dislocations is found to be responsible for Cr precipitation.\n", "  This paper describes the response of the IceCube neutrino telescope located\nat the geographic South Pole to outbursts of MeV neutrinos from the core\ncollapse of nearby massive stars. IceCube was completed in December 2010\nforming a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1\ncubic kilometer in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. The\ntelescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV.\nOwing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are\nparticularly low. Hence IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos\nby observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark\nnoise. With 2 ms timing resolution, IceCube can detect subtle features in the\ntemporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. For a supernova at the\ngalactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free\nmegaton-scale supernova search experiment. The sensitivity decreases to 20\nstandard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). IceCube is sending triggers from potential\nsupernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System. The sensitivity to neutrino\nproperties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed, as well as the\npossibility to detect the neutronization burst, a short outbreak of electron\nneutrinos released by electron capture on protons soon after collapse.\nTantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole\nas well as the characteristics of shock waves, are investigated to illustrate\nIceCube's capability for supernova detection.\n", "  We propose a general strategy for determining the minimal finite amplitude\nisturbance to trigger transition to turbulence in shear flows. This involves\nconstructing a variational problem that searches over all disturbances of fixed\ninitial amplitude, which respect the boundary conditions, incompressibility and\nthe Navier--Stokes equations, to maximise a chosen functional over an\nasymptotically long time period. The functional must be selected such that it\nidentifies turbulent velocity fields by taking significantly enhanced values\ncompared to those for laminar fields. We illustrate this approach using the\nratio of the final to initial perturbation kinetic energies (energy growth) as\nthe functional and the energy norm to measure amplitudes in the context of pipe\nflow. Our results indicate that the variational problem yields a smooth\nconverged solution providing the amplitude is below the threshold amplitude for\ntransition. This optimal is the nonlinear analogue of the well-studied (linear)\ntransient growth optimal. At and above this threshold, the optimising search\nnaturally seeks out disturbances that trigger turbulence by the end of the\nperiod, and convergence is then practically impossible. The first disturbance\nfound to trigger turbulence as the amplitude is increased identifies the\n`minimal seed' for the given geometry and forcing (Reynolds number). We\nconjecture that it may be possible to select a functional such that the\nconverged optimal below threshold smoothly converges to the minimal seed at\nthreshold. This seems at least approximately true for our choice of energy\ngrowth functional and the pipe flow geometry chosen here.\n", "  The first generation of stars had very different properties than later\nstellar generations, as they formed from a \"pristine\" gas that was free of\nheavy elements. Normal star formation took place only after the first stars\npolluted the surrounding turbulent interstellar gas, increasing its local heavy\nelement concentration, Z, beyond a critical value, Z_c (10^-8 < Z_c <10^-5).\nMotivated by this astrophysical problem, we investigate the fundamental physics\nof the pollution of pristine fluid elements in isotropic compressible\nturbulence. Turbulence stretches the pollutants, produces concentration\nstructures at small scales, and brings the pollutants and the unpolluted flow\nin closer contact. Our theoretical approach employs the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) method for turbulent mixing. We adopt three PDF\nclosure models and derive evolution equations for the pristine fraction from\nthe models. To test and constrain the theoretical models, we conduct numerical\nsimulations for decaying passive scalars in isothermal turbulent flows with\nMach numbers of 0.9 and 6.2, and compute the mass fraction, P(Z_c, t), of the\nflow with Z < Z_c. In the Mach 0.9 flow, the evolution of P(Z_c, t)$ is well\ndescribed by a continuous convolution model and dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t)\nln[P(Z_c, t)]/tau_con, if the mass fraction of the polluted flow is larger than\n~ 0.1. If the initial pollutant fraction is smaller than ~ 0.1, an early phase\nexists during which the pristine fraction follows an equation from a nonlinear\nintegral model: dP(Z_c, t)/dt = P(Z_c, t) [P(Z_c, t)-1]/tau_int. The timescales\ntau_con and tau_int are measured from our simulations. When normalized to the\nflow dynamical time, the decay of P(Z_ c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow is slower\nthan at Mach 0.9, and we show that P(Z_c, t) in the Mach 6.2 flow can be well\nfit using a formula from a generalized version of the self-convolution model.\n", "  Harmonic oscillations of the walls of a turbulent plane channel flow are\nstudied by direct numerical simulations to improve our understanding of the\nphysical mechanism for skin-friction drag reduction. The simulations are\ncarried out at constant pressure gradient in order to define an unambiguous\ninner scaling: in this case, drag reduction manifests itself as an increase of\nmass flow rate. Energy and enstrophy balances, carried out to emphasize the\nrole of the oscillating spanwise shear layer, show that the viscous\ndissipations of the mean flow and of the turbulent fluctuations increase with\nthe mass flow rate, and the relative importance of the latter decreases. We\nthen focus on the turbulent enstrophy: through an analysis of the temporal\nevolution from the beginning of the wall motion, the dominant,\noscillation-related term in the turbulent enstrophy is shown to cause the\nturbulent dissipation to be enhanced in absolute terms, before the slow drift\ntowards the new quasi-equilibrium condition. This mechanism is found to be\nresponsible for the increase in mass flow rate. We finally show that the\ntime-average volume integral of the dominant term relates linearly to the drag\nreduction.\n", "  The superconducting pairing instability---as determined by a divergence of\nthe two-particle susceptibility---is obtained in the mean field (BCS)\napproximation in the thermodynamic limit. The usual practice is to examine this\nproperty for a finite lattice. We illustrate that, while the conclusions remain\nunchanged, the technical features are very different in the thermodynamic limit\nand conform more closely with the usual treatment of phase transitions\nencountered in, for example, the mean-field paramagnetic-ferromagnetic\ntransition. Furthermore, by going to the extreme dilute limit, one can\ndistinguish three dimensions from one and two dimensions, in which a pairing\ninstability occurs even for two particles.\n", "  A reactive fluid dissolving the surface of a uniform fracture will trigger an\ninstability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation of\npronounced well-spaced channels in the surrounding rock matrix. Although the\nunderlying mechanism is similar to the wormhole instability in porous rocks\nthere are significant differences in the physics, due to the absence of a\nsteadily propagating reaction front. In previous work we have described the\ngeophysical implications of this instability in regard to the formation of long\nconduits in soluble rocks. Here we describe a more general linear stability\nanalysis, including axial diffusion, transport limited dissolution, non-linear\nkinetics, and a finite length system.\n", "  IGR J18179-1621 is a hard X-ray binary transient discovered recently by\nINTEGRAL. Here we report on detailed timing and spectral analysis on IGR\nJ18179-1621 in X-rays based on available INTEGRAL and Swift data. From the\nINTEGRAL analysis, IGR J18179-1621 is detected with a significance of 21.6\nsigma in the 18-40 keV band by ISGRI and 15.3 sigma in the 3-25 keV band by\nJEM-X, between 2012-02-29 and 2012-03-01. We analyze two quasisimultaneous\nSwift ToO observations. A clear 11.82 seconds pulsation is detected above the\nwhite noise at a confidence level larger than 99.99%. The pulse fraction is\nestimated as 22+/-8% in 0.2-10 keV. No sign of pulsation is detected by\nINTEGRAL/ISGRI in the 18-40 keV band. With Swift and INTEGRAL spectra combined\nin soft and hard X-rays, IGR J18179-1621 could be fitted by an absorbed power\nlaw with a high energy cutoff plus a Gaussian absorption line centered at 21.5\nkeV. An additional absorption intrinsic to the source is found, while the\nabsorption line is evidence for most probably originated from cyclotron\nresonant scattering and suggests a magnetic field in the emitting region of\n\\sim 2.4 \\times 10^12 Gauss.\n", "  We review searches for closed string axions and axion-like particles (ALPs)\nin IIB string flux compactifications. For natural values of the background\nfluxes and TeV scale gravitino mass, the moduli stabilisation mechanism of the\nLARGE Volume Scenario predicts the existence of a QCD axion candidate with\nintermediate scale decay constant, f_a ~ 10^9 ... 10^12 GeV, associated with\nthe small cycles wrapped by the branes hosting the visible sector, plus a\nnearly massless and nearly decoupled ALP associated with the LARGE cycle. In\nsetups where the visible sector branes are wrapping more than the minimum\nnumber of two intersecting cycles, there are more ALPs which have approximately\nthe same decay constant and coupling to the photon as the QCD axion candidate,\nbut which are exponentially lighter. There are exciting phenomenological\nopportunities to search for these axions and ALPs in the near future. For f_a ~\n10^11 ... 10^12 GeV, the QCD axion can be the dominant part of dark matter and\nbe detected in haloscopes exploiting microwave cavities. For f_a ~ 10^9 ...\n10^10 GeV, the additional ALPs could explain astrophysical anomalies and be\nsearched for in the upcoming generation of helioscopes and\nlight-shining-through-a-wall experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we study the problem of the nonlinear interaction of impulsive\ngravitational waves for the Einstein vacuum equations. The problem is studied\nin the context of a characteristic initial value problem with data given on two\nnull hypersurfaces and containing curvature delta singularities. We establish\nan existence and uniqueness result for the spacetime arising from such data and\nshow that the resulting spacetime represents the interaction of two impulsive\ngravitational waves germinating from the initial singularities. In the\nspacetime, the curvature delta singularities propagate along 3-dimensional null\nhypersurfaces intersecting to the future of the data. To the past of the\nintersection, the spacetime can be thought of as containing two independent,\nnon-interacting impulsive gravitational waves and the intersection represents\nthe first instance of their nonlinear interaction. Our analysis extends to the\nregion past their first interaction and shows that the spacetime still remains\nsmooth away from the continuing propagating individual waves. The construction\nof these spacetimes are motivated in part by the celebrated explicit solutions\nof Khan-Penrose and Szekeres. The approach of this paper can be applied to an\neven larger class of characteristic data and in particular implies an extension\nof the theorem on formation of trapped surfaces by Christodoulou and\nKlainerman-Rodnianski, allowing non-trivial data on the initial incoming\nhypersurface.\n", "  We prove the possibility of existence of stationary bound states of spin-half\nparticles in the Reissner-Nordstroem gravitational field using a self-conjugate\nHamiltonian with a flat scalar product of wave functions. Bound states of Dirac\nparticles with a real discrete energy spectrum can exist both for particles\nabove the external \"event horizon\", and for particles under the internal \"event\nhorizon\", or the Cauchy horizon. The Hilbert condition g_{00}>0 leads to a\nboundary condition such that components of the vector of current density of\nDirac particles are zero near the \"event horizons\". Based on the results of\nthis study, we can assume that there exists a new type of charged collapsars,\nfor which the Hawking radiation is not present. The results of this study can\nlead to a revision of some concepts of the standard cosmological model related\nto the evolution of the universe and interaction of charged collapsars with\nsurrounding matter.\n", "  We prove the possibility of existence of stationary bound states of\nstationary bound states of spin-half probe particles for the Kerr and\nKerr-Newman gravitational fields using Chandrasekhar's Hamiltonian. If the\nHilbert condition is satisfied, g_{00}>0, bound states of Dirac particles with\na real discrete energy spectrum can exist both for particles outside the\nsurface of the outer ergosphere of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman fields, and for\nparticles under the surface of the inner ergosphere. In this case, the surfaces\nof the external and internal ergospheres play the role of infinitely high\npotential barriers. Spin-half quantum-mechanical particles cannot cross the\nergosphere surfaces of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman fields. Based on the results of\nthis study, we can assume that there exists a new type of rotating collapsars,\nfor which the Hawking radiation is absent. The results of this study can lead\nto a revision of some concepts of the standard cosmological model related to\nthe evolution of the universe and interaction of rotating collapsars with\nsurrounding matter.\n", "  A mathematically rigorous relativistic quantum Yang-Mills theory with an\narbitrary semisimple compact gauge Lie group is set up in the Hamiltonian\ncanonical formalism. The theory is non-perturbative, without cut-offs, and\nagrees with the causality and stability principles. This paper presents a fully\nrevised, simplified, and corrected version of the corresponding material in the\nprevious papers DYNIN[11] and [12]. The principal result is established anew:\ndue to the quartic self-interaction term in the Yang-Mills Lagrangian along\nwith the semisimplicity of the gauge group, the quantum Yang-Mills energy\nspectrum has a positive mass gap. Furthermore, the quantum Yang-Mills\nHamiltonian has a countable orthogonal eigenbasis in a Fock space, so that the\nquantum Yang-Mills spectrum is point and countable. In addition a fine\nstructure of the spectrum is elucidated.\n  KEYS: Millennium Yang-Mills problem; Finite propagation speed; Sobolev\ninequalities; Nuclear vector spaces; Infinite-dimensional holomorphy;\nFriedrichs operator extensions; Variational spectral principle; Symbols and\nspectral theory of pseudo-differential operators.\n", "  We introduce a differential geometric framework for describing families of\nquantum error-correcting codes and for understanding quantum fault tolerance.\nThis work unifies the notion of topological fault tolerance with fault\ntolerance in other kinds of quantum error-correcting codes. In particular, we\nuse fibre bundles with a natural flat projective connection to study the\ntransformation of codewords under unitary fault-tolerant evolutions. We show\nthat the fault-tolerant logical operations are given by the monodromy group for\neither of two bundles, both of which have flat projective connections. As\nconcrete realizations of the general framework, we construct the bundles\nexplicitly for two examples of fault-tolerant families of operations, the qudit\ntransversal gates and the string operators in the toric code.\n", "  We present a route for direct growth of boron nitride via a polyborazylene to\nh-BN conversion process. This two-step growth process ultimately leads to a\n>25x reduction in the RMS surface roughness of h-BN films when compared to a\nhigh temperature growth on Al2O3(0001) and Si(111) substrates. Additionally,\nthe stoichiometry is shown to be highly dependent on the initial polyborazylene\ndeposition temperature. Importantly, CVD graphene transferred to direct-grown\nboron nitride films on Al2O3 at 400{\\deg}C results in a >1.5x and >2.5x\nimprovement in mobility compared to CVD graphene transferred to Al2O3 and SiO2\nsubstrates, respectively, which is attributed to the combined reduction of\nremote charged impurity scattering and surface roughness scattering. Simulation\nof mobility versus carrier concentration confirms the importance of limiting\nthe introduction of charged impurities in the h-BN film and highlights the\nimportance of these results in producing optimized h-BN substrates for high\nperformance graphene and TMD devices.\n", "  The hypothesis of cosmic censorship (CCH) plays a crucial role in classical\ngeneral relativity, namely to ensure that naked singularities would never\nemerge, since it predicts that whenever a singularity is formed an event\nhorizon would always develop around it as well, to prevent the former from\ninteracting directly with the rest of the Universe. Should this not be so,\nnaked singularities could eventually form, in which case phenomena beyond our\nunderstanding and ability to predict could occur, since at the vicinity of the\nsingularity both predictability and determinism break down even at the\nclassical (e.g. non-quantum) level. More than 40 years after it was proposed,\nthe validity of the hypothesis remains an open question. We reconsider CCH in\nboth its weak and strong version, concerning point-like singularities, with\nrespect to the provisions of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We argue that\nthe shielding of the singularities from observers at infinity by an event\nhorizon is also quantum mechanically favored, but ultimately it seems more\nappropriate to accept that singularities never actually form in the usual\nsense, thus no naked singularity danger exists in the first place.\n", "  We have collected and analyzed the relevant data from public schools in\ngreater Houston area of Texas. Based and analyzed. Since the data is only\nlimited to a few school, we are still working on getting more data so that we\ncan compare and contrast the results adequately and understand the core of the\nenrollment issue at the national level. However, based on the raw data and\npartial analysis, we propose a few recommendations towards the improvement of\nscience education in Texas Schools, in general, and greater Houston area\nschools in particular. Our results indicate that the quality of science\neducation can be improved significantly if we focus on the improvement of high\nschool education or even intermediate schools when students are first time\nexposed to science in a little technical way. Simply organizing teacher\ntraining programs at K-12 level as school education plays a pivotal role in the\ndecrease in physics enrollment at the higher level. Similar analysis can\nactually be generalized to other states to find out the best way to increase\nthe physics enrollment.\n", "  We report the renormalization and mixing constants to one-loop order for the\nquark and gluon energy-momentum (EM) tensor operators on the lattice. A unique\naspect of this mixing calculation is the definition of the glue EM tensor\noperator. The glue operator is comprised of gauge-field tensors constructed\nfrom the overlap Dirac operator. The resulting perturbative calculations are\nperformed using methods similar to the Kawai approach using the Wilson action\nfor all QCD vertices and the overlap Dirac operator to define the glue EM\ntensor. Our results are used to connect the lattice QCD results of quark and\nglue momenta and angular momenta to the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at input\nscale $\\mu$\n", "  In this work a study about the energy-momentum of a new four-dimensional\nspherically symmetric, static and charged, regular black hole solution\ndeveloped in the context of general relativity coupled to nonlinear\nelectrodynamics is presented. Asymptotically, this new black hole solution\nbehaves as the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution only for the particular value\n{\\mu}=4, where {\\mu} is a positive integer parameter appearing in the mass\nfunction of the solution. The calculations are performed by use of the\nEinstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Weinberg and M{\\o}ller energy-momentum complexes. In\nall the aforesaid prescriptions, the expressions for the energy of the\ngravitating system considered depend on the mass M of the black hole, its\ncharge q, a positive integer {\\alpha} and the radial coordinate r. In all these\npseudotensorial prescriptions the momenta are found to vanish, while the\nLandau-Lifshitz and Weinberg prescriptions give the same result for the energy\ndistribution. In addition, the limiting behavior of the energy for the cases r\ntends toward infinity, r=0 and q=0 is studied. The special case {\\mu}=4 and\n{\\alpha}=3 is also examined. We conclude that the Einstein and M{\\o}ller\nenergy-momentum complexes can be considered as the most reliable tools for the\nstudy of the energy-momentum localization of a gravitating system.\n", "  We present a general mechanism to establish the existence of diffusing orbits\nin a large class of nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. Our approach relies\non successive applications of the `outer dynamics' along homoclinic orbits to a\nnormally hyperbolic invariant manifold. The information on the outer dynamics\nis encoded by a geometrically defined map, referred to as the `scattering map'.\n  We find pseudo-orbits of the scattering map that keep advancing in some\nprivileged direction. Then we use the recurrence property of the `inner\ndynamics', restricted to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, to return\nto those pseudo-orbits. Finally, we apply topological methods to show the\nexistence of true orbits that follow the successive applications of the two\ndynamics.\n  This method differs, in several crucial aspects, from earlier works. Unlike\nthe well known `two-dynamics' approach, the method we present relies on the\nouter dynamics alone. There are virtually no assumptions on the inner dynamics,\nas its invariant objects (e.g., primary and secondary tori, lower dimensional\nhyperbolic tori and their stable/unstable manifolds, Aubry-Mather sets) are not\nused at all.\n  The method applies to unperturbed Hamiltonians of arbitrary degrees of\nfreedom that are not necessarily convex. In addition, this mechanism is easy to\nverify (analytically or numerically) in concrete examples, as well as to\nestablish diffusion in generic systems.\n  We include several applications, such as bridging large gaps in a priori\nunstable models in any dimension, and establishing diffusion in cases when the\ninner dynamics is a non-twist map.\n", "  Experimental evidences indicate that formations of disks and planetary\nsystems around pulsars are allowed. Unfortunately, direct detections through\nelectromagnetic observations appear to be quite rare. In the case of PSR\n1931+24, the hypothesis of a rigid precessing disk penetrating the pulsar light\ncylinder is found consistent with radio transient observations from this star.\nDisk self-occultation and precession may limit electromagnetic observations.\nConversely, we show here that gravitational waves generated by disk precessing\nnear the light cylinder of young and middle aged pulsars would be detected by\nfuture space interferometers with sensitivities like those expected for DECIGO\n(DECI-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) and BBO (Big Bang\nObserver). The characteristics of circumpulsar detectable precessing disks are\nestimated as a function of distance from the Solar System. Speculations on\nupper limits to detection rates are presented.\n", "  We study the effective parameters of QED near decoupling temperatures and\nshow that the QED perturbative series is convergent, at temperatures below the\ndecoupling temperature. The renormalization constant of QED acquires different\nvalues if a system cools down from a hotter system to the electron mass\ntemperature or heats up from a cooler system to the same temperature. At T = m,\nthe first order contribution to the electron selfmass, {\\delta}m/m is 0.0076\nfor a heating system and 0.0115 for a cooling system and the difference between\ntwo values is equal to 1/3 of the low temperature value and 1/2 of the high\ntemperature value around T~m. This difference is a measure of hot fermion\nbackground at high temperatures. With the increase in release of more fermions\nat hotter temperatures, the fermion background contribution dominates and weak\ninteractions have to be incorporated to understand the background effects.\n", "  In this paper, we study the \"minimal requirement\" on the incoming radiation\nthat guarantees a trapped surface to form in vacuum. First, we extend the\nregion of existence in Christodoulou's theorem on the formation of trapped\nsurfaces and consequently show that the lower bound required to form a trapped\nsurface can be relaxed. Second, we demonstrate that trapped surfaces form\ndynamically from a class of initial data which are large merely in a\nscaling-critical norm. This result is motivated in part by the scaling in\nChristodoulou's formation of trapped surfaces theorem for the Einstein-scalar\nfield system in spherical symmetry.\n", "  The dependencies of the phase of eclipse of the white dwarf's centre and the\ndurations of the ascending and descending branches of the light curve on the\nbinary system's parameters were computed using the spherically-symmetric\napproximation and the more accurate model of the elliptical projection onto the\ncelestial sphere of the companion (red dwarf) that fills its Roche lobe. The\nparameters of eclipses in the classical eclipsing polar OTJ 071126+440405 = CSS\n081231:071126+440405 were estimated.\n", "  We searched for evidence of a Higgsstrahlung process in a secluded sector,\nleading to a final state with a dark photon U and a dark Higgs boson h', with\nthe KLOE detector at DAFNE. We investigated the case of h' lighter than U, with\nU decaying into a muon pair and h' producing a missing energy signature. We\nfound no evidence of the process and set upper limits to its parameters in the\nrange 2m_mu<m_U<1000 MeV, m_h'<m_U.\n", "  We study the single-particle dispersion of a spin-orbit coupled (SOC)\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) under the periodical modulation of the Raman\ncoupling. This modulation introduces a further coupling of the SOC dressed\neigenlevels, thus creating a second generation of modulation-dressed\neigenlevels. Theoretical calculations show that these modulation-dressed\neigenlevels feature a pair of avoided crossings and a richer spin-momentum\nlocking, which we observe using BEC transport measurements. Furthermore, we use\nthe pair of avoided crossings to engineer a tunable Stueckelberg interferometer\nthat gives interference fringes in the spin polarization of BECs.\n", "  Nematic state, where the system is translationally invariant but breaks the\nrotational symmetry, has drawn great attentions recently due to experimental\nobservations of such a state in both cuprates and iron-based superconductors.\nThe mechanism of nematicity that is likely tied to the pairing mechanism of\nhigh-Tc, however, still remains controversial. Here, we studied the electronic\nstructure of multilayer FeSe film by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES). We found that the FeSe film enters the nematic state around 125 K,\nwhile the electronic signature of long range magnetic order has not been\nobserved down to 20K indicating the non-magnetic origin of the nematicity. The\nband reconstruction in the nematic state is characterized by the splitting of\nthe dxz and dyz bands. More intriguingly, such energy splitting is strong\nmomentum dependent with the largest band splitting of ~80meV at the zone\ncorner. The simple on-site ferro-orbital ordering is insufficient to reproduce\nthe nontrivial momentum dependence of the band reconstruction. Instead, our\nresults suggest that the nearest-neighbor hopping of dxz and dyz is highly\nanisotropic in the nematic state, the origin of which holds the key in\nunderstanding the nematicity in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  It is well known that life on Earth alters its environment over evolutionary\nand geological timescales. An important open question is whether this is a\nresult of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the\nlatter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in\nenvironmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in\nwhich replicators are explicitly coupled to their environment through the\nrecycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic,\nfirst-order phase transition from non-life to \"life,\" where the life phase is\ndistinguished by selection on replicators. We show that environmental coupling\nplays an important role in the dynamics of the transition. The transition\ncorresponds to a redistribution of matter in replicators and their environment,\ndriven by selection on replicators, exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity\nas replicators are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual\ninformation shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of\nsuccessfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,\nleading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.\nOften, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are\nultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's\npropensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of\nreplicators, characteristic of the transition from non-life to life. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for understanding life's emergence and\nevolutionary transitions more broadly.\n", "  In this paper, 14-velocity and 18-velocity multiple-relaxation-time (MRT)\nlattice Boltzmann (LB) models are proposed for three-dimensional incompressible\nflows. These two models are constructed based on the incompressible LBGK model\nproposed by He et al. (Chin. Phys., 2004, 13: 40-46) and the MRT LB model\nproposed by d'Humi\\`{e}res et al. (Philos. Trans. R. Soc., A, 2002, 360:\n437-451), which have advantages in the computational efficiency and stability,\nrespectively. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, the models can recover to\nthree-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the low Mach number\nlimit. To verify the present models, the steady Poiseuille flow, unsteady\npulsatile flow and lid-driven cavity flow in three dimensions are simulated.\nThe simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions or the existing\nnumerical results. Moreover, it is found that the present models show higher\naccuracy than d'Humi\\`{e}res et al. model and better stability than He et al.\nmodel.\n", "  We study equilibrium states of an infinite system of interacting particles in\na Euclidean space. The particles bear `unbounded' spins with a given symmetric\na priori distribution. The interaction between the particles is pairwise and\nsplits into position-position and spin-spin parts. The position-position part\nis described by a superstable potential, and the spin-spin part is attractive\nand of finite range. Thermodynamic states of the system are defined as tempered\nGibbs measures on the space of marked configurations. We derive sufficient\nconditions of the existence and uniqueness of these Gibbs measures.\n", "  We give a constructive proof for the existence of an $N$-dimensional Bloch\nbasis which is both smooth (real analytic) and periodic with respect to its\n$d$-dimensional quasi-momenta, when $1\\leq d\\leq 2$ and $N\\geq 1$. The\nconstructed Bloch basis is conjugation symmetric when the underlying projection\nhas this symmetry, hence the corresponding exponentially localized composite\nWannier functions are real. In the second part of the paper we show that by\nadding a weak, globally bounded but not necessarily constant magnetic field,\nthe existence of a localized basis is preserved.\n", "  We apply classical algorithms for approximately solving constraint\nsatisfaction problems to find bounds on extremal eigenvalues of local\nHamiltonians. We consider spin Hamiltonians for which we have an upper bound on\nthe number of terms in which each spin participates, and find extensive bounds\nfor the operator norm and ground-state energy of such Hamiltonians under this\nconstraint. In each case the bound is achieved by a product state which can be\nfound efficiently using a classical algorithm.\n", "  We construct twisted Calogero-Moser (CM) systems with spins as the Hitchin\nsystems derived from the Higgs bundles over elliptic curves, where transitions\noperators are defined by an arbitrary finite order automorphisms of the\nunderlying Lie algebras. In this way we obtain the spin generalization of the\ntwisted D'Hoker- Phong and Bordner-Corrigan-Sasaki-Takasaki systems. As by\nproduct, we construct the corresponding twisted classical dynamical r-matrices\nand Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations related to the automorphisms of\nthe Lie algebras.\n", "  Climate change is widely expected to increase weather related damage and the\ninsurance claims that result from it. This will increase insurance premiums, in\na way that is independent of a customer's contribution to the causes of climate\nchange. Insurance provides a financial mechanism that mitigates some of the\nconsequences of climate change, allowing damage from increasingly frequent\nevents to be repaired. We observe that the insurance industry could reclaim any\nincrease in claims due to climate change, by increasing the insurance premiums\non energy producers for example, without needing government intervention or a\nnew tax. We argue that this insurance-led levy must acknowledge both present\ncarbon emissions and a modern industry's carbon inheritance, that is, to\nrecognise that fossil-fuel driven industrial growth has provided the\ninnovations and conditions needed for modern civilisation to exist and develop.\nA tax or levy on energy production is one mechanism that would recognise carbon\ninheritance through the increased (energy) costs for manufacturing and using\nmodern technology, and can also provide an incentive to minimise carbon\nemissions, through higher costs for the most polluting industries. The\nnecessary increases in insurance premiums would initially be small, and will\nrequire an event attribution (EA) methodology to determine their size. We\npropose that the levies can be phased in as the science of event attribution\nbecomes sufficiently robust for each claim type, to ultimately provide a global\ninsurance-led response to climate change.\n", "  During the last few years, the Geneva stellar evolution group has released\nnew grids of stellar models, including the effect of rotation and with updated\nphysical inputs (Ekstr\\\"om et al. 2012; Georgy et al. 2013a,b). To ease the\ncomparison between the outputs of the stellar evolution computations and the\nobservations, a dedicated tool was developed: the Syclist toolbox (Georgy et\nal. 2014). It allows to compute interpolated stellar models, isochrones,\nsynthetic clusters, and to simulate the time-evolution of stellar populations.\n", "  Paramagnetic impurities in a quantum spin-liquid can result in Kondo effects\nwith highly unusual properties. We have studied the effect of locally\nexchange-coupling a paramagnetic impurity with the spin-1/2 honeycomb Kitaev\nmodel in its gapless spin-liquid phase. The (impurity) scaling equations are\nfound to be insensitive to the sign of the coupling. The weak and strong\ncoupling fixed points are stable, with the latter corresponding to a\nnoninteracting vacancy and an interacting, spin-1 defect for the\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases respectively. The ground state in the\nstrong coupling limit in both cases has a nontrivial topology associated with a\nfinite Z2 flux at the impurity site. For the antiferromagnetic case, this\nresult can be obtained straightforwardly owing to the integrability of the\nKitaev model with a vacancy. The strong-coupling limit of the ferromagnetic\ncase is however nonintegrable, and we address this problem through\nexact-diagonalization calculations with finite Kitaev fragments. Our exact\ndiagonalization calculations indicate that that the weak to strong coupling\ntransition and the topological phase transition occur rather close to each\nother and are possibly coincident. We also find an intriguing similarity\nbetween the magnetic response of the defect and the impurity susceptibility in\nthe two-channel Kondo problem.\n", "  Atom interferometry tests of universality of free fall based on the\ndifferential measurement of two different atomic species provide a useful\ncomplement to those based on macroscopic masses. However, when striving for the\nhighest possible sensitivities, gravity gradients pose a serious challenge.\nIndeed, the relative initial position and velocity for the two species need to\nbe controlled with extremely high accuracy, which can be rather demanding in\npractice and whose verification may require rather long integration times.\nFurthermore, in highly sensitive configurations gravity gradients lead to a\ndrastic loss of contrast. These difficulties can be mitigated by employing wave\npackets with narrower position and momentum widths, but this is ultimately\nlimited by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We present a novel scheme that\nsimultaneously overcomes the loss of contrast and the initial co-location\nproblem. In doing so, it circumvents the fundamental limitations due to\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle and eases the experimental realization by\nrelaxing the requirements on initial co-location by several orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  This work exploits the zeptoliter sensing volume of electrolyte-filled\nnanopores to determine, simultaneously and in real time, the approximate shape,\nvolume, charge, rotational diffusion coefficient, and dipole moment of\nindividual proteins. We have developed the theory for a quantitative\nunderstanding and analysis of modulations in ionic current that arise from\nrotational dynamics of single proteins as they move through the electric field\ninside a nanopore. The resulting multi-parametric information raises the\npossibility to characterize, identify, and quantify individual proteins and\nprotein complexes in a mixture. This approach interrogates single proteins in\nsolution and determines parameters such as the approximate shape and dipole\nmoment, which are excellent protein descriptors and cannot be obtained\notherwise from single protein molecules in solution. Taken together, this\nfive-dimensional characterization of biomolecules at the single particle level\nhas the potential for instantaneous protein identification, quantification, and\npossibly sorting with implications for structural biology, proteomics,\nbiomarker detection, and routine protein analysis.\n", "  We calculate the mean square amplitude of the shape fluctuation -- an\nequal-time correlation -- of an almost planar fluid membrane immersed in a\nnear-critical binary fluid mixture. One fluid component is usually\npreferentially attracted by the membrane, and becomes more concentrated around\nit because of the near criticality. This generates osmotic pressure, which\ninfluences the amplitude. The amplitude is also affected by the reversible\ndynamics of the mixture, which moves with the membrane. By assuming the\nGaussian free-energy functional and weak preferential attraction, the author\npreviously showed that a new term is added to the restoring force of the\nmembrane and tends to suppress the amplitude. Not assuming both of them, but\nstill focusing on modes with wavelength longer than the correlation length, we\nhere calculate the amplitude of a tensionless membrane. First, within the\nGaussian model, we solve the governing equations to show that, for long\nwavelength, the additional term becomes predominant, although decreased\nhydrodynamic effects make its numerical factor approximately half that of the\nprevious result. The change in the term turns out not to be monotonic with the\nwavelength, which is mainly caused by the change in the induced mass. Second,\nassuming the critical composition far from the membrane, we calculate the\namplitude beyond the regime of the Gaussian model. The result coincides roughly\nwith the corresponding result in the Gaussian model if the correlation length\nis interpreted as one close to the membrane.\n", "  Knowledge of abundance ratios as functions of metallicity can lead to\ninsights on the origin and evolution of our Galaxy and its stellar populations.\nWe aim to trace the chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Zr,\nLa, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu in the Milky Way stellar disk to constrain the formation\nsites of these elements as well as to probe the evolution of the Galactic thin\nand thick disks. Using spectra of high resolution and high signal-to-noise we\ndetermine Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu abundances for a sample of 593 F and G\ndwarf stars in the Solar neighbourhood. We present abundance results for Sr,\nZr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm and Eu. We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to\nwhat is observed for the alpha-elements when compared to [Fe/H]. [Sr/Fe] and\n[Zr/Fe] show decreasing abundance ratios for increasing metallicity, reaching\nsub-solar values at super-solar metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show\nany clear trend with metallicity. The rapid neutron-capture process is active\nearly in the Galaxy, mainly in type II supernovae from stars in the mass range\n8-10 M_sun. Eu is almost completely produced by r-process but Nd and Sm show\nsimilar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher. Sr and Zr\nshow significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra r-process\nproduction, that probably is different from the classical r-process. Finally,\nLa and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB stars in mass range 2-4\nM_sun. The trend of [X/Fe] with age found could be explained by considering\nthat the decrease in [X/Fe] for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease\nof type II supernovae with time meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process\nelements in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk the trends are flatter\nthat probably is due to that the main production from s-process is balanced by\nFe production from type Ia supernovae.\n", "  We prove a family of $n$-th order identities for quantum $R$-matrices of\nBaxter-Belavin type in fundamental representation. The set of identities\nincludes the unitarity condition as the simplest one ($n=2$). Our study is\ninspired by the fact that the third order identity provides commutativity of\nthe Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connections. On the other hand the same\nidentity gives rise to $R$-matrix valued Lax pairs for the classical integrable\nsystems of Calogero type. The latter construction uses interpretation of\nquantum $R$-matrix as matrix generalization of the Kronecker function. We\npresent a proof of the higher order scalar identities for the Kronecker\nfunctions which is then naturally generalized to the $R$-matrix identities.\n", "  The Heisenberg uncertainty principle suggests that it is impossible to\ndetermine the trajectory of a quantum particle in the same way as a classical\nparticle. However, we may still yield insight into novel behavior of photons\nbased on the average photon trajectories (APTs). Here we explore the APTs of\nphotons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) and/or orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) under the paraxial condition. We define the helicity and differential\nhelicity for unveiling the three-dimensional spiral structures of the APTs of\nphotons. We clarify the novel behaviors of the APTs caused by the SAM and OAM\nas well as the SAM-OAM coupling. The APT concept is very helpful for profoundly\nunderstanding the motion of trapped particles and for elucidating other\nphysical systems. Due to the presence of the helical path caused by the SAM\nand/or the OAM, the actual traveling distance of the photons might be much\nlonger than the geometric distance.\n", "  Current-induced domain wall (DW) motion has drawn great attention in the last\ndecades as the key operational principle of emerging magnetic memory devices.\nAs the major driving force of the current-induced DW motion, the spin-orbit\ntorque (SOT) on chiral DWs has been proposed and extensively studied nowadays.\nHowever, we demonstrate here that there exists another driving force, which is\nlarger than the SOT in ultra-thin Co films. Moreover, the direction of the\npresent force is found to be opposite to the prediction of the spin-transfer\ntorque (STT), resulting in the DW motion along the current direction. The\nsymmetry of the force and its peculiar dependence on the DW structure suggest\nthat the present force is, most likely, attributed to considerable enhancement\nof the nonadiabatic STT with a negative spin polarization in atomically thin Co\nlayers. These findings open a new pathway to enhance the overall spin torque\nefficiency-the critical parameter in emerging spintronic devices.\n", "  We have studied the behaviour of stellar streams in the Aquarius fully\ncosmological N-body simulations of the formation of Milky Way halos. In\nparticular, we have characterised the streams in angle/frequency spaces derived\nusing an approximate but generally well-fitting spherical potential. We have\nalso run several test-particle simulations to understand and guide our\ninterpretation of the different features we see in the Aquarius streams. Our\ngoal is both to establish which deviations of the expected action-angle\nbehaviour of streams exist because of the approximations made on the potential,\nbut also to derive to what degree we can use these coordinates to model streams\nreliably.\n  We have found that many of the Aquarius streams wrap in angle space along\nrelatively straight lines, and also in frequency space. On the other hand, from\nour controlled simulations we have been able to establish that deviations from\nspherical symmetry, the use of incorrect potentials and the inclusion of\nself-gravity lead to streams in angle space to still be along relatively\nstraight lines but also to depict wiggly behaviour whose amplitude increases as\nthe approximation to the true potential becomes worse. In frequency space\nstreams typically become thicker and somewhat distorted. Therefore, our\nanalysis explains most of the features seen in the approximate angle and\nfrequency spaces for the Aquarius streams with the exception of their somewhat\n`noisy' and `patchy' morphologies. These are likely due to the interactions\nwith the large number of dark matter subhalos present in the cosmological\nsimulations. Since the measured angle-frequency misalignments of the Aquarius\nstreams can largely be attributed to using the wrong (spherical) potential,\ndetermining the mass growth history of these halos will only be feasible once\nthe true potential has been determined robustly.\n", "  Optical properties of a metasurface which can be considered a monolayer of\ntwo classical uniaxial metamaterials, parallel-plate and nanorod arrays, are\ninvestigated. It is shown that such metasurface acts as an ultimately thin\nsub-50 nm wave plate. This is achieved via an interplay of epsilon-near-zero\nand epsilon-near-pole behavior along different axes in the plane of the\nmetasurface allowing for extremely rapid phase difference accumulation in very\nthin metasurface layers. These effects are shown to not be disrupted by\nnon-locality and can be applied to the design of ultrathin wave plates,\nPancharatnam-Berry phase optical elements and plasmon-carrying optical torque\nwrench devices.\n", "  We investigate holographic phase transitions affected by dark matter sector\nin the AdS soliton background away from the probe limit. When neglecting\nbackreaction, the scalar charge q can be scaled unity without loss of\ngenerality. While considering backreaction in this work, we obtain much more\nricher physics by choosing various scalar charge q. Firstly, we observe\nunstable retrograde condensation appears due to the dark matter sector and also\nderive stable conditions. For stable solutions, we find that the larger\ncoupling parameter $\\alpha$ makes the gap of condensation shallower and the\ncritical chemical potential keeps as a constant with a large scalar charge q,\nwhich is similar to cases in the probe limit. In contrast, the dark matter\nsector could affect the critical chemical potential and the order of phase\ntransitions for very small charge q. We also arrive at the same conclusion from\nthe holographic topological entanglement entropy approach. Moreover, we state\nthat the entanglement entropy approach is especially powerful in studying the\neffects of the dark matter sector in this general insulator/superconductor\nsystem.\n", "  We review some results of calculations, having the property of maximal\ntranscendentality.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of a heavy scalar $\\phi$ of the type\ninvolved in Bekenstein's framework for varying electromagnetic coupling\ntheories, with the difference that the scalar in our model has a large mass.\nThe model has only two free parameters, the mass $M_{\\phi}$ of the scalar and\nthe scale $\\Lambda$ of new physics. The scalar is dominantly produced through\nphoton-photon fusion at the LHC and leads to a diphoton final state. It can\nalso be produced by quark-antiquark fusion in association with a photon or a\nfermion pair. Its dominating decay is to diphotons, but it also has a large\nthree-body branching to a fermion pair and a photon, which can provide an\ninteresting search channel with a dilepton-photon resonance. We derive\nexclusion limits on the $M_{\\phi}-\\Lambda$ plane from the latest 13 TeV LHC\ndiphoton resonance search data. For a benchmark mass of $M_{\\phi}\\sim 1$ TeV,\nwe find a lower limit on $\\Lambda$ of 18 TeV. We discuss the more complex\npossibility of varying couplings in the full electroweak theory and comment on\nthe possibility that the new physics is related to extra dimensions or string\ntheory.\n", "  We model a single layer of heavily electron-doped FeSe by spin-1/2 moments\nover a square lattice of iron atoms that include the 3d xz and 3d yz orbitals,\nat strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. Above half filling, we find emergent hole\nbands below the Fermi level at the center of the one-iron Brillouin zone in a\nhalf metal state characterized by hidden magnetic order and by electron-type\nFermi surface pockets at wavenumbers that double the unit cell along the\nprincipal axes. \"Replicas\" of the emergent hole bands exist at lower energy in\nthe two-iron Brillouin zone. Exact calculations with two mobile electrons find\nevidence for isotropic Cooper pairs that alternate in sign between the electron\nbands and the emergent hole bands.\n", "  Anisotropic cosmological models are investigated in the frame work of $f(R)$\ngravity in the metric formalism. Plane symmetric models are considered to\nincorporate anisotropy in the expansion rates along different spatial\ndirections. The anisotropy in expansion rates are assumed to be maintained\nthroughout the cosmic evolution. Two accelerating models are constructed by\nconsidering different functional forms for f(R). The viability of these models\nare tested through a stability analysis.\n", "  We test ideas put forward e.g in arXiv:1508.02368, which suggest that using\nrates in quantum optics can lead to better indicators of non-classicality for\nstates of quantum optical fields with undefined photon numbers. By rate we mean\nthe ratio of registered photons in a given detector to the total number of\ndetected photons in all detectors in the experiment. For the Hong-Ou-Mandel\neffect for parametric down conversion fields, we show that by using two\ndetector correlation functions which are defined in terms of averages of\nproducts of measured rates, rather than usual intensities, one can observe non\n-- classical visibilities beyond $1/2$ for significantly higher pump rates. At\nsuch rates we already have a partially stimulated emission which leads to\nsignificant amplitudes for multiple pairs production, still the new approach\nallows to clearly see the non-classical dip.\n", "  In this work we study the constraints on dark matter (DM) annihilation/decay\nfrom the Fermi-LAT Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background (IGRB) observation. We\nconsider the contributions from both extragalactic and galactic DM components.\nFor DM annihilation, the evolutions of extragalactic DM halos are taken into\naccount. We find that the IGRB constraints under some DM subhalo models can be\ncomparable to those derived from the observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\nWe also use the IGRB results to constrain the parameter regions accounting for\nthe latest AMS-02 electron-positron anomaly. We find that the majority of DM\nannihilation/decay channels are strongly disfavored by the latest Fermi-LAT\nIGRB observation; only DM annihilation/decay to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ may be valid.\n", "  Fluid instabilities arise in a variety of contexts and are often unwanted\nresults of engineering imperfections. In one particular model for a magnetized\ntarget fusion reactor, a pressure wave is propagated in a cylindrical annulus\ncomprised of a dense fluid before impinging upon a plasma and imploding it.\nPart of the success of the apparatus is a function of how axially-symmetric the\nfinal pressure pulse is upon impacting the plasma. We study a simple model for\nthe implosion of the system to study how imperfections in the pressure imparted\non the outer circumference grow due to geometric focusing. Our methodology\nentails linearizing the compressible Euler equations for mass and momentum\nconservation about a cylindrically symmetric problem and analyzing the\nperturbed profiles at different mode numbers. The linearized system gives rise\nto singular shocks and through analyzing the perturbation profiles at various\ntimes, we infer that high mode numbers are dampened through the propagation. We\nalso study the Linear Klein-Gordon equation in the context of stability of\nlinear cylindrical wave formation whereby highly oscillatory, bounded behaviour\nis observed in a far field solution.\n", "  The Mg II emission line is visible in the optical band for intermediate\nredshift quasars (0.4 < z < 1.6) and it is thus an extremely important tool to\nmeasure the black hole mass and to understand the structure of the Broad Line\nRegion. We aim to determine the substructure and the variability of the Mg II\nline with the aim to identify which part of the line comes from a medium in\nKeplerian motion. Using the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) with the\nRobert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) we performed ten spectroscopic observations of\nquasar HE 0435-4312 (z = 1.2231) over a period of three years (Dec 23/24, 2012\nto Dec 7/8, 2015). Both the Mg II line and the Fe II pseudo-continuum increase\nwith time. We clearly detect the systematic shift of the Mg II line with\nrespect to the Fe II over the years, corresponding to the acceleration of 104\npm 14 km/s/year in the quasar rest frame. The Mg II line shape is clearly\nnon-Gaussian but single-component, and the increase in line equivalent width\nand line shift is not accompanied with significant evolution of the line shape.\nWe analyse the conditions in the Mg II and Fe II formation region and we note\nthat the very large difference in the covering factor and the turbulent\nvelocity also support the conclusion that the two regions are spatially\nseparated. The measured acceleration of the line systematic shift is too large\nto connect it with the orbital motion at a distance of the Broad Line Region\n(BLR) in this source. It may imply a precessing inner disk illuminating the\nBLR. Further monitoring is still needed to better constrain the variability\nmechanism.\n", "  The early inspiral phase of a compact binary coalescence is well modelled by\nthe post-Newtonian (PN) approximation to the orbital energy and gravitational\nwave flux. The transition from the inspiral phase to the plunge can be defined\nby the minimum energy circular orbit (MECO). In the extreme mass-ratio limit,\nup to the highest PN order known, the PN energy equals the energy of the exact\nKerr solution. However, for comparable-mass systems the MECO of the PN energy\ndoes not exist when bodies have large spins. By including the exact Kerr limit\nand recently published post-Newtonian terms we extract a well-defined minimum\nof the orbital energy beyond which the plunge or merger occurs. We study the\nhybrid condition for a number of cases of both black hole and neutron stars and\ncompare to other commonly employed definitions. Our method can be used for any\nknown order of the post-Newtonian series and enables the MECO condition to be\nused to define the end of the inspiral phase for highly spinning, comparable\nmass systems.\n", "  We present a microstructural model of permeability in fractured solids, where\nthe fractures are described in terms of recursive families of parallel,\nequidistant cohesive faults. Faults originate upon the attainment of a tensile\nor shear resistance in the undamaged material. Secondary faults may form in a\nhierarchical orga- nization, creating a complex network of connected fractures\nthat modify the permeability of the solid. The undamaged solid may possess\ninitial porosity and permeability. The particular geometry of the superposed\nmicro-faults lends itself to an explicit analytical quantification of the\nporosity and permeability of the dam- aged material. The approach is\nparticularly appealing as a means of modeling low permeability oil and gas\nreservoirs stimulated by hydraulic fracturing.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenology of leptonic low and\nhigh energy CP phases in a scenario with three heavy right-handed neutrinos in\nwhich a flavor and a CP symmetry are non-trivially broken. All CP phases as\nwell as lepton mixing angles are determined by the properties of the flavor and\nCP symmetry and one free real parameter. We focus on the generation of the\nbaryon asymmetry Y_B of the Universe via unflavored leptogenesis and the\npredictions of m_ee, the quantity measurable in neutrinoless double beta decay.\nWe show that the sign of Y_B can be fixed and the allowed parameter range of\nm_ee can be strongly constrained. We argue on general grounds that the CP\nasymmetries epsilon_i are dominated by the contribution associated with one\nMajorana phase and that in cases in which only the Dirac phase is non-trivial\nthe sign of Y_B depends on further parameters. In addition, we comment on the\ncase of flavored leptogenesis where in general the knowledge of the CP phases\nand light neutrino mass spectrum is also not sufficient in order to fix the\nsign of the CP asymmetries. As examples we discuss the series of flavor groups\nDelta (3 n^2) and Delta (6 n^2), n >= 2 integer, and several classes of CP\ntransformations.\n", "  The degree-degree correlation is important in understanding the structural\norganization of a network and the dynamics upon a network. Such correlation is\nusually measured by the assortativity coefficient $r$, with natural bounds $r\n\\in [-1,1]$. For scale-free networks with power-law degree distribution $p(k)\n\\sim k^{-\\gamma}$, we analytically obtain the lower bound of assortativity\ncoefficient in the limit of large network size, which is not -1 but dependent\non the power-law exponent $\\gamma$. This work challenges the validation of\nassortativity coefficient in heterogeneous networks, suggesting that one cannot\njudge whether a network is positively or negatively correlated just by looking\nat its assortativity coefficient.\n", "  A novel and universal interference structure is found in the photoelectron\nmomentum distribution of atoms in intense infrared laser field. Theoretical\nanalysis shows that this structure can be attributed to a new form of\nCoulomb-field-driven backward-scattering of photoelectrons in the direction\nperpendicular to the laser field, in contrast to the conventional rescattering\nalong the laser polarization direction. This transverse backward-scattering\nprocess is closely related to a family of photoelectrons initially ionized\nwithin a time interval of less than 200 attosecond around the crest of the\nlaser electric field. Those electrons, acquiring near-zero return energy in the\nlaser field, will be pulled back solely by the ionic Coulomb field and\nbackscattered in the transverse direction. Moreover, this rescattering process\nmainly occurs at the first or the second return times, giving rise to different\nphases of the photoelectrons. The interference between these photoelectrons\nleads to unique curved interference fringes which are observable for most\ncurrent intense field experiments, opening a new way to record the electron\ndynamics in atoms and molecules on a time scale much shorter than an optical\ncycle.\n", "  The conventional ways of processing natural gas into more efficient and\neconomical fuels usually either have low conversion rate or low energy\nefficiency. In this work, a new approach of methane liquefaction is proposed.\nInstead of direct treatment of only natural gas, plasma activated methane is\nreacting with liquid fuel. In this way, methane molecules are directly\nincorporated onto liquid fuel to achieve liquefaction. Nanosecond-pulsed\ndielectric barrier discharge and atmospheric pressure glow discharge are used\nhere to ensure no local heating in gas bubbles. Effects of both discharges on\nmethane reaction with liquid fuel are investigated, mass and chemical changes\nin liquid are observed. Preliminary results show fixation of methane in liquid\nfuel.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the groupoidification of the fermion algebra. We\nconstruct a groupoid as the categorical analogues of the fermionic Fock space,\nand the creation and annihilation operators correspond to spans of groupoids.\nThe categorical fermionic Fock states have some extra structures comparing with\nthe normal forms. We also construct a 2-category of spans of groupoids\ncorresponding to the fermion algebra. The relations of the morphisms in this\n2-category are consistent with those in the graphical category which is\nrepresented by string diagrams.\n", "  We propose that a large Schwarzschild black hole (BH) is a bound state of\nhighly excited, long, closed strings at the Hagedorn temperature. The size of\nthe bound state is smaller than the string random-walk scale and determined\ndynamically by the string attractive interactions. It is further proposed that\nthe effective free-energy density of the bound state should be expressed as a\nfunction of its entropy density. For a macroscopic BH, the free-energy density\ncontains only linear and quadratic terms, in analogy with that of a collapsed\npolymer when expressed as a function of the polymer concentration. Using the\neffective free energy, we derive scaling relations for the entropy, energy and\nsize of the bound state and show that these agree with the scaling relations of\nthe BH; in particular, with the area law for the BH entropy. The area law\noriginates from the inverse scaling of the effective temperature with the\nbound-state radius. We also find that the energy density of the bound state is\nequal to its pressure.\n", "  Considering a bosonic ($1$-)form-valued $k$-form with a second-order\nLagrangian dynamics [depending on two arbitrary real constants] we firstly\nperform the Dirac analysis. The procedure implies a partition of cardinally\nseven for the plane of the real parameters that label the starting Lagrangian.\nIn each of the seven partition's components one determines the number and the\nnature of independent degrees of freedom and also a generating set of gauge\ntransformations. Secondly, with the help of some auxiliary gauge/matter tensor\ngauge fields, in each of the seven situations, we construct the first-order\nLagrangian density corresponding to the second-order one.\n", "  We compute the value of effective photon mass $m_\\gamma$ at one-loop level in\nQED in the background of small ($10^{10}\\,\\text{g} \\lesssim M \\ll\n10^{16}\\,\\text{g}$) spherically symmetric black hole in asymptotically flat\nspacetime. This effect is associated with the modification of electron/positron\npropagator in presence of event horizon. Physical manifestations of black-hole\nenvironment are compared with those of hot neutral plasma. We estimate the\ndistance to the nearest black hole from the upper bound on $m_\\gamma$ obtained\nin the Coulomb-law test. We also find that corrections to electron mass $m_e$\nand fine structure constant $\\alpha$ at one-loop level in QED are negligible in\nthe weak gravity regime.\n", "  It has been proposed that during the early steps in the origin of life, small\ndroplets could have formed via the segregation of molecules from complex\nmixtures by phase separation. These droplets could have provided chemical\nreaction centers. However, whether these droplets could divide and propagate is\nunclear. Here we examine the behavior of droplets in systems that are\nmaintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium by an external supply of energy.\nIn these systems, droplets grow by the addition of droplet material generated\nby chemical reactions. Surprisingly, we find that chemically driven droplet\ngrowth can lead to shape instabilities that trigger the division of droplets\ninto two smaller daughters. Therefore, chemically active droplets can exhibit\ncycles of growth and division that resemble the proliferation of living cells.\nDividing active droplets could serve as a model for prebiotic protocells, where\nchemical reactions in the droplet play the role of a prebiotic metabolism.\n", "  Geometrically non-Higgsable seven-branes carry gauge sectors that cannot be\nbroken by complex structure deformation, and there is growing evidence that\nsuch configurations are typical in F-theory. We study strongly coupled physics\nassociated with these branes. Axiodilaton profiles are computed using\nRamanujan's theories of elliptic functions to alternative bases, showing\nexplicitly that the string coupling is order one in the vicinity of the brane;\nthat it sources nilpotent $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ monodromy and therefore the\nassociated brane charges are modular; and that essentially all F-theory\ncompactifications have regions with order one string coupling. It is shown that\nnon-perturbative $SU(3)$ and $SU(2)$ seven-branes are related to weakly coupled\ncounterparts with D7-branes via deformation-induced Hanany-Witten moves on\n$(p,q)$ string junctions that turn them into fundamental open strings; only the\nformer may exist for generic complex structure. D3-brane near these and the\nKodaira type II seven-branes probe Argyres-Douglas theories. The BPS states of\nslightly deformed theories are shown to be dyonic string junctions.\n", "  Motivated by results of the topological theory of glasses accounting for\ngeometric frustration, we develop the simplest possible continuum mechanical\nmodel of defect dynamics in metallic glasses that accounts for topological,\nenergetic, and kinetic ideas. The model is aimed towards the development of a\nmicroscopic understanding of the plasticity of such materials. We discuss the\nexpected predictive capabilities of the model vis-a-vis some observed physical\nbehaviors of metallic glasses.\n", "  A novel, optimized numerical method of modeling of an exciton-polariton\nsuperfluid in a semiconductor microcavity was proposed. Exciton-polaritons are\nspin-carrying quasiparticles formed from photons strongly coupled to excitons.\nThey possess unique properties, interesting from the point of view of\nfundamental research as well as numerous potential applications. However, their\nnumerical modeling is challenging due to the structure of nonlinear\ndifferential equations describing their evolution. In this paper, we propose to\nsolve the equations with a modified Runge--Kutta method of 4th order, further\noptimized for efficient computations. The algorithms were implemented in form\nof C++ programs fitted for parallel environments and utilizing vector\ninstructions. The programs form the EPCGP suite which have been used for\ntheoretical investigation of exciton-polaritons.\n", "  In the paper we develop the dressing method for the solution of the\ntwo-dimensional periodic Volterra system with a period N. We derive soliton\nsolutions of arbitrary rank $k$ and give a full classification of rank 1\nsolutions. We have found a new class of exact solutions corresponding to wave\nfronts which represent smooth interfaces between two nonlinear periodic waves\nor a periodic wave and a trivial (zero) solution. The wave fronts are\nnon-stationary and they propagate with a constant average velocity. The system\nalso has soliton solutions similar to breathers, which resembles soliton webs\nin the KP theory. We associate the classification of soliton solutions with the\nSchubert decomposition of the Grassmanians ${\\rm Gr}_{\\mathbb{R}}(k,N)$ and\n${\\rm Gr}_{\\mathbb{C}}(k,N)$.\n", "  We propose a new method to test modified gravity theories, taking advantage\nof the available data on extrasolar planets. We computed the deviations from\nthe Kepler third law and use that to constrain gravity theories beyond General\nRelativity. We investigate gravity models which incorporate three screening\nmechanisms: the Chameleon, the Symmetron and the Vainshtein. We find that data\nfrom exoplanets orbits are very sensitive to the screening mechanisms putting\nstrong constraints in the parameter space for the Chameleon models and the\nSymmetron, complementary and competitive to other methods, like interferometers\nand solar system. With the constraints on Vainshtein we are able to work beyond\nthe hypothesis that the crossover scale is of the same order of magnitude than\nthe Hubble radius $r_c \\sim H_0^{-1}$, which makes the screening work\nautomatically, testing how strong this hypothesis is and the viability of other\nscales.\n", "  We consider the early time regime of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation\nin $1+1$ dimensions in curved (or droplet) geometry. We show that for short\ntime $t$, the probability distribution $P(H,t)$ of the height $H$ at a given\npoint $x$ takes the scaling form $P(H,t) \\sim \\exp{\\left(-\\Phi_{\\rm\ndrop}(H)/\\sqrt{t} \\right)}$ where the rate function $\\Phi_{\\rm drop}(H)$ is\ncomputed exactly. While it is Gaussian in the center, i.e., for small $H$, the\nPDF has highly asymmetric non-Gaussian tails which we characterize in detail.\nThis function $\\Phi_{\\rm drop}(H)$ is surprisingly reminiscent of the large\ndeviation function describing the stationary fluctuations of finite size models\nbelonging to the KPZ universality class. Thanks to a recently discovered\nconnection between KPZ and free fermions, our results have interesting\nimplications for the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion in a harmonic trap\nat high temperature and the full couting statistics at the edge.\n", "  In search of states with non-Abelian statistics, we explore the fractional\nquantum Hall effect in a system of two-dimensional charge carrier holes. We\npropose a new method of mapping states of holes confined to a finite width\nquantum well in a perpendicular magnetic field to states in a spherical shell\ngeometry. This method provides single-particle hole states used in exact\ndiagonalization of systems with a small number of holes in the presence of\nCoulomb interactions. An incompressible fractional quantum Hall state emerges\nin a hole liquid at the half-filling of the ground state in a magnetic field in\nthe range of fields where single-hole states cross. This state has a negligible\noverlap with the Halperin 331 state, but a significant overlap with the\nMoore-Read Pfaffian state. Excited fractional quantum Hall states for small\nsystems have sizable overlap with non-Abelian excitations of the Moore-Read\nPfaffian state.\n", "  The Laplace's equations for the scalar and vector potentials describing\nelectric or magnetic fields in cylindrical coordinates with translational\ninvariance along azimuthal coordinate are considered. The series of special\nfunctions which, when expanded in power series in radial and vertical\ncoordinates, in lowest order replicate the harmonic homogeneous polynomials of\ntwo variables are found. These functions are based on radial harmonics found by\nEdwin~M.~McMillan in his more-than-40-years \"forgotten\" article, which will be\ndiscussed. In addition to McMillan's harmonics, second family of adjoint radial\nharmonics is introduced, in order to provide symmetric description between\nelectric and magnetic fields and to describe fields and potentials in terms of\nsame special functions. Formulas to relate any transverse fields specified by\nthe coefficients in the power series expansion in radial or vertical planes in\ncylindrical coordinates with the set of new functions are provided.\n  This result is no doubt important for potential theory while also critical\nfor theoretical studies, design and proper modeling of sector dipoles, combined\nfunction dipoles and any general sector element for accelerator physics. All\nresults are presented in connection with these problems.\n", "  We investigate induced electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in models in\nwhich the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB). In pNGB Higgs models,\nHiggs properties and precision electroweak measurements imply a hierarchy\nbetween the EWSB and global symmetry-breaking scales, $v_H \\ll f_H$. When the\npNGB potential is generated radiatively, this hierarchy requires fine-tuning to\na degree of at least $\\sim v_H^2/f_H^2$. We show that if Higgs EWSB is induced\nby a tadpole arising from an auxiliary sector at scale $f_\\Sigma \\ll v_H$, this\ntuning is significantly ameliorated or can even be removed. We present explicit\nexamples both in Twin Higgs models and in Composite Higgs models based on\n$SO(5)/SO(4)$. For the Twin case, the result is a fully natural model with $f_H\n\\sim 1$ TeV and the lightest colored top partners at 2 TeV. These models also\nhave an appealing mechanism to generate the scales of the auxiliary sector and\nHiggs EWSB directly from the scale $f_H$, with a natural hierarchy $f_\\Sigma\n\\ll v_H \\ll f_H \\sim{\\rm TeV}$. The framework predicts modified Higgs coupling\nas well as new Higgs and vector states at LHC13.\n", "  The origin of Cooper pairing in high-temperature superconductors, such as the\ncopper-oxide and iron-based system, is still under debate. High transition\ntemperatures together with unconventional pairing states support the picture of\nan electronic pairing glue in the cuprates, where superconductivity is mediated\nby collective bosonic excitations of the electron fluid. In other materials,\nmost importantly iron based systems with only hole or only electron pockets,\nthe microscopic origin is hotly debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nhas been shown to be a powerful experimental probe to detect electronic\nexcitations and further allows to deduce some fingerprints of bosonic\ncollective modes. Here, we demonstrate that the inclusion of inelastic tunnel\nevents is crucial for the interpretation of tunneling spectra and allows to\ndirectly probe bosonic excitations via STM. We develop a model describing both\nthe elastic tunneling current, which displays the electronic spectral function,\nand the inelastic current, that contains the information about the bosonic\nspectrum, in the superconducting state. Adopting this extended tunneling\nformalism we can naturally reproduce the tunneling spectra of various\nunconventional superconductors and trace the occurring features back to an\nopening of a spin gap in the superconducting state. More generally, our\napproach is a strong argument in favour of a collective mode mediating the\npairing state in particular in iron-based systems. In particular, we conclude\nthat the debated pairing mechanism in LiFeSe is also of electronic origin with\nsign-changing pairing symmetry.\n", "  In this paper we suggest generalizations of elliptic integrable tops to\nmatrix-valued variables. Our consideration is based on $R$-matrix description\nwhich provides Lax pairs in terms of quantum and classical $R$-matrices. First,\nwe prove that for relativistic (and non-relativistic) tops such Lax pairs with\nspectral parameter follow from the associative Yang-Baxter equation and its\ndegenerations. Then we proceed to matrix extensions of the models and find out\nthat some additional constraints are required for their construction. We\ndescribe a matrix version of ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ reduced elliptic top and verify\nthat the latter constraints are fulfilled in this case. The construction of\nmatrix extensions is naturally generalized to the monodromy preserving\nequation. In this way we get matrix extensions of the Painlev\\'e VI equation\nand its multidimensional analogues written in the form of non-autonomous\nelliptic tops. Finally, it is mentioned that the matrix valued variables can be\nreplaced by elements of noncommutative associative algebra. In the end of the\npaper we also describe special elliptic Gaudin models which can be considered\nas matrix extensions of the (${\\mathbb Z}_2$ reduced) elliptic top.\n", "  We study topological properties of one-dimensional nonlinear bichromatic\nsuperlattices and unveil the effect of nonlinearity on topological states. We\nfind the existence of nontrivial edge solitions, which distribute on the\nboundaries of the lattice with their chemical potential located in the linear\ngap regime and are sensitive to the phase parameter of the superlattice\npotential. We further demonstrate that the topological property of the\nnonlinear Bloch bands can be characterized by topological Chern numbers defined\nin the extended two-dimensional parameter space. In addition, we discuss that\nthe composition relations between the nolinear Bloch waves and gap solitions\nfor the nonlinear superlattices. The stabilities of edge solitons are also\nstudied.\n", "  There is chiral like symmetry for 4-component massless fermion in\n(2+1)-dimensional gauge theory.Since QED$_{3}$ with Chern-Simons term contains\nvortex solution for vector potential,one may expect vortex driven phase\ntransition as Kosterlitz-Thouless type where chiral condensate is washed away\nat zero temperature.To study this possibility,we evaluate the fermion\npropagator by Dyson-Schwinger equation numerically and spectral function\nanalytically in the Landau gauge.For quenched case we adopt Ball-Chiu vertex to\nkeep gauge invariance of the results.The critical value of topological\nmass,above which chiral condensate washed away, turned out to be\n$O(10^{-2})e^{2}$ at least for weak coupling in both cases.\n", "  Frequency analysis of the rf emission of oscillating Josephson supercurrent\nis a powerful passive way of probing properties of topological Josephson\njunctions. In particular, measurements of the Josephson emission enables to\ndetect the expected presence of topological gapless Andreev bound states that\ngive rise to emission at half the Josephson frequency $f_J$, rather than\nconventional emission at $f_J$. Here we report direct measurement of rf\nemission spectra on Josephson junctions made of HgTe-based gate-tunable\ntopological weak links. The emission spectra exhibit a clear signal at half the\nJosephson frequency $f_{\\rm J}/2$. The linewidths of emission lines indicate a\ncoherence time of $0.3-\\SI{4}{ns}$ for the $f_{\\rm J}/2$ line, much shorter\nthan for the $f_{\\rm J}$ line ($3-\\SI{4}{ns}$). These observations strongly\npoint towards the presence of topological gapless Andreev bound states, and\npave the way for a future HgTe-based platform for topological quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  This work gives results on the interplay of the spectra of two Jacobi\noperators corresponding to an infinite mass-spring system and a modification of\nit obtained by changing one mass and one spring of the system. It is shown that\nthe system can be recovered from these two spectra. Necessary and sufficient\nconditions for two sequences to be the spectra of the mass-spring system and\nthe perturbed one are provided.\n", "  We report a comprehensive study of the energy response to low-energy recoils\nin dual-phase xenon-based dark matter experiments. A recombination model is\ndeveloped to explain the recombination probability as a function of recoil\nenergy at zero field and non-zero field. The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We\nshow a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a\nstronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils. As a\nresult, the time-dependent recombination is implemented in the determination of\ncharge and light yield with a generic model. Our model agrees well with the\navailable experimental data from xenon-based dark matter experiments.\n", "  To describe the transverse distribution of charged hadrons at 1.96 TeV\nobserved by the CDF collaboration, we propose a formula with two component,\nnamely, hadron gas distributions and inverse power laws. The data collected at\n0.9, 2.76, 7, and 13 TeV by the ALICE, CMS, and ATLAS collaborations are also\nanalyzed using various models including single component models as well as two\ncomponent models. The results by using modified version of Hagedorn's formula\nare compared with those by using the two component model proposed by Bylinkin,\nRostovtsev and Ryskin (BRR). Moreover, we show that there is an interesting\ninterrelation among our the modified version of Hagedorn's formula, a formula\nproposed by ATLAS collaboration, and the BRR formula.\n", "  An expression for the density of a planar induced vacuum charge is obtained\nin a strong Coulomb potential in coordinate space. Treatment is based on a\nself-adjoint extension approach for constructing of the Green's function of a\ncharged fermion in this potential. Induced vacuum charge density is calculated\nand analyzed at the subcritical and supercritical Coulomb potentials for\nmassless and massive fermions. The behavior of the obtained vacuum charge\ndensity is investigated at long and short distances from the Coulomb center.\nThe induced vacuum charge has a screening sign. Screening of a Coulomb impurity\nin graphene is briefly discussed. We calculate the real vacuum polarization\ncharge density that acquires the quantum electrodynamics vacuum in the\nsupercritical Coulomb potential due to the so-called real vacuum polarization.\nIt is shown that the vacuum charge densities essentially differ in massive and\nmassless cases. We expect that our results can, as a matter of principle, be\ntested in graphene with a supercritical Coulomb impurity.\n", "  We propose a multielectron approach to calculate superexchange interaction in\nmagnetic Mott- Hubbard insulator La2CuO4(further La214) that allows to obtain\nthe effect of optical pumping on the superexchange interaction. We use the cell\nperturbation theory with exact diagonalization of the multiband pd Hamiltonian\ninside each CuO6 unit cell and treating the intercell hopping as perturbation.\nTo incorporate effect of optical pumping we include in this work the excited\nsinglehole local states as well as all two-hole singlets and triplets. By\nprojecting out the interband intercell electron hopping we have obtained the\neffective Heisenberg-like Hamiltonian with the local spin at site Ri being a\nsuperposition of the ground and excited single-hole states. We found that\nantiferromagnetic contribution to the exchange energy in La214 will increase in\naccordance to ~ 4*10_{-3} eV /(%) at the resonance light occupation of the\nexcited single hole in-gap state.\n", "  We present a new model that extends the Standard Model (SM) with the local\nB+L symmetry, and point out that the lightest new fermion $\\zeta$, introduced\nto cancel anomalies and stabilized automatically by the B+L symmetry, can serve\nas the cold dark matter candidate. We study constraints on the model from Higgs\nmeasurements, electroweak precision measurements as well as the relic density\nand direct detections of the dark matter. Numerical results reveal that the\npseudo-vector coupling of $\\zeta$ with $Z$ and the Yukawa coupling with the SM\nHiggs are highly constrained by the latest results of LUX, while there are\nviable parameter space that could satisfy all the constraints and give testable\npredictions.\n", "  In recent years graphical processing units (GPUs) have become a powerful tool\nin scientific computing. Their potential to speed up highly parallel\napplications brings the power of high performance computing to a wider range of\nusers. However, programming these devices and integrating their use in existing\napplications is still a challenging task.\n  In this paper we examined the potential of GPUs for two different\napplications. The first application, created at Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI),\nis used for parameter fitting during data analysis of muSR (muon spin rotation,\nrelaxation and resonance) experiments. The second application, developed at\nETH, is used for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) image reconstruction and\nanalysis. Applications currently in use were examined to identify parts of the\nalgorithms in need of optimization. Efficient GPU kernels were created in order\nto allow applications to use a GPU, to speed up the previously identified\nparts. Benchmarking tests were performed in order to measure the achieved\nspeedup\n  During this work, we focused on single GPU systems to show that real time\ndata analysis of these problems can be achieved without the need for large\ncomputing clusters. The results show that the currently used application for\nparameter fitting, which uses OpenMP to parallelize calculations over multiple\nCPU cores, can be accelerated around 40 times through the use of a GPU. The\nspeedup may vary depending on the size and complexity of the problem. For PET\nimage analysis, the obtained speedups of the GPU version was more than x40\nlarger compared to a single core CPU implementation. The achieved results show\nthat it is possible to improve the execution time by orders of magnitude.\n", "  We present a novel control methodology to control the roughening processes of\nsemilinear parabolic stochastic partial differential equations in one\ndimension, which we exemplify with the stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation. The original equation is split into a linear stochastic and a\nnonlinear deterministic equation so that we can apply linear feedback control\nmethods. Our control strategy is then based on two steps: first, stabilize the\nzero solution of the deterministic part and, second, control the roughness of\nthe stochastic linear equation. We consider both periodic controls and point\nactuated ones, observing in all cases that the second moment of the solution\nevolves in time according to a power-law until it saturates at the desired\ncontrolled value.\n", "  We investigate a new method to recover (if any) a possible varying speed of\nlight (VSL) signal from cosmological data. It comes as an upgrade of [1,2],\nwhere it was argued that such signal could be detected at a single redshift\nlocation only. Here, we show how it is possible to extract information on a VSL\nsignal on an extended redshift range. We use mock cosmological data from future\ngalaxy surveys (BOSS, DESI, \\emph{WFirst-2.4} and SKA): the sound horizon at\ndecoupling imprinted in the clustering of galaxies (BAO) as an angular diameter\ndistance, and the expansion rate derived from those galaxies recognized as\ncosmic chronometers. We find that, given the forecast sensitivities of such\nsurveys, a $\\sim1\\%$ VSL signal can be detected at $3\\sigma$ confidence level\nin the redshift interval $z \\in [0.,1.55]$. Smaller signals $(\\sim0.1\\%)$ will\nbe hardly detected (even if some lower possibility for a $1\\sigma$ detection is\nstill possible). Finally, we discuss the degeneration between a VSL signal and\na non-null spatial curvature; we show that, given present bounds on curvature,\nany signal, if detected, can be attributed to a VSL signal with a very high\nconfidence. On the other hand, our method turns out to be useful even in the\nclassical scenario of a constant speed of light: in this case, the signal we\nreconstruct can be totally ascribed to spatial curvature and, thus, we might\nhave a method to detect a $0.01$-order curvature in the same redhift range with\na very high confidence.\n", "  Local symmetries is one of the most successful themes in modern theoretical\nphysics. Although they are usually associated to Lie algebras, a gradual\nincrease of interest in more general situations where local symmetries are\nassociated to groupoids and algebroids has taken place in recent years. On the\nother hand, dualities is another persistently interesting theme in modern\nphysics. One of the most prominent examples is provided by target space duality\nin string theory. The latter, Abelian or not, is usually associated to the\npresence of isometries, which is however a very restrictive assumption. In this\ncontribution we discuss some recent advances located at the intersection of the\nabove two themes. Focusing on bosonic string sigma models we discuss certain\ngauged versions where (a) the invariance conditions on the background fields\nare much milder than the isometric case and (b) the gauge symmetry is\ngenerically associated to a Lie algebroid instead of just a Lie algebra.\nFurthermore we utilize such gauged sigma models to study the possibility of\nnon-Abelian, non-isometric T-duality.\n", "  We study the response of a simple quasi-geostrophic barotropic model of the\natmosphere to various classes of perturbations affecting its forcing and its\ndissipation using the formalism of the Ruelle response theory. We investigate\nthe geometry of such perturbations by constructing the covariant Lyapunov\nvectors of the unperturbed system and discover in one specific case -\norographic forcing - a substantial projection of the forcing onto the stable\ndirections of the flow. This results into a resonant response shaped as a\nRossby-like wave that has no resemblance to the unforced variability in the\nsame range of spatial and temporal scales. Such a climatic surprise corresponds\nto a violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, in agreement with the\nbasic tenets of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The resonance can be\nattributed to a specific group of rarely visited unstable periodic orbits of\nthe unperturbed system. Our results reinforce the idea of using basic methods\nof nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and high-dimensional chaotic dynamical\nsystems to approach the problem of understanding climate dynamics.\n", "  We present both full quantum mechanical and semiclassical calculations of\nabove threshold ionization (ATI) of a hydrogen atom in the tunneling regime by\na few-cycle linearly polarized infrared laser pulse. As a quantum treatment, we\napplied the direct integration of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\n(TDSE). In the semiclassical approximation (SCA), it is assumed that wavepacket\npropagation in the post-tunneling process can be well described within the\nclassical framework. With these two methods, we analyze the similarities and\ndeviations for ionization of the hydrogen atom. We found that the 3 dimensional\nsemiclassical method can describe reasonably well the momentum correlation\npattern of the ATI peaks. We also show good agreement between the results\nobtained by TDSE method and the semi-classical method. Furthermore, with the\nsemiclassical approximation we clearly identify and separate the regions in\nmomentum distributions of the ejected electrons according to initial\nconditions. We illustrate the corresponding regions with typical electron\ntrajectories.\n", "  Kinetics of separation between the low and high density phases in a single\ncomponent Lennard-Jones model has been studied via molecular dynamics\nsimulations, at a very low temperature, in the space dimension $d=2$. For\ndensities close to the vapor (low density) branch of the coexistence curve,\ndisconnected clusters of the high density phase exhibit ballistic motion, the\nkinetic energy distribution of the clusters being closely Maxwellian. Starting\nfrom nearly circular shapes, at the time of nucleation, these clusters grow via\nsticky collisions, gaining filament-like nonequilibrium structure at late\ntimes, with a very low fractal dimensionality. The origin of the latter is\nshown to lie in the low mobility of the constituent particles, in the\ncorresponding cluster reference frame, due to the (quasi-long-range)\ncrystalline order. Standard self-similarity in the domain pattern, typically\nobserved in kinetics of phase transitions, is found to be absent in this growth\nprocess. This invalidates the common method, that provides a growth law same as\nin immiscible solid mixtures, of quantifying growth. An appropriate alternative\napproach, involving the fractality in the structure, quantifies the growth of\nthe characteristic \"length\" to be a power-law with time, the exponent being\nsurprisingly high. The observed growth law has been derived via a\nnonequilibrium kinetic theory.\n", "  In the first paper of this series, we proposed a novel method to probe\nlarge-scale intergalactic magnetic fields during the cosmic Dark Ages, using\n21-cm tomography. This method relies on the effect of spin alignment of\nhydrogen atoms in a cosmological setting, and on the effect of magnetic\nprecession of the atoms on the statistics of the 21-cm brightness-temperature\nfluctuations. In this paper, we forecast the sensitivity of future tomographic\nsurveys to detecting magnetic fields using this method. For this purpose, we\ndevelop a minimum-variance estimator formalism to capture the characteristic\nanisotropy signal using the two-point statistics of the brightness-temperature\nfluctuations. We find that, depending on the reionization history, and subject\nto the control of systematics from foreground subtraction, an array of dipole\nantennas in a compact-grid configuration with a collecting area slightly\nexceeding one square kilometer can achieve a $1\\sigma$ detection of\n$\\sim$$10^{-21}$ Gauss comoving (scaled to present-day value) within three\nyears of observation. Using this method, tomographic 21-cm surveys could thus\nprobe ten orders of magnitude below current CMB constraints on primordial\nmagnetic fields, and provide exquisite sensitivity to large-scale magnetic\nfields in situ at high redshift.\n", "  This paper is a prosecution of a previous work where we presented a unified\ntwo-fermion covariant scheme which produced very precise results for the masses\nof light and heavy mesons. We extend the analysis to some radiative decays of\nmesons $\\Upsilon,\\,\\chi_{b2}\\,,h_b\\,,\\chi_{b1}\\,,\\chi_{b0}\\,,\\eta_b\\,$ and we\ncalculate their branching ratios and their widths. For most of them we can make\na comparison with experimental data finding a good agreement.For the decays for\nwhich data are not available we compare ours with other recent theoretical\nprevisions.\n", "  The group $\\Sigma(36\\times3)$ with the generalized CP transformation is\nintroduced to predict the mixing pattern of leptons. Various combinations of\nabelian residual flavor symmetries with CP transformations are surveyed. Six\nmixing patterns could accommodate the fit data of neutrinos oscillation at\n$3\\sigma$ level. Among them, two patterns predict the nontrivial Dirac CP\nphase, around $\\pm 57^{\\circ}$ or $\\pm 123^{\\circ}$, which is in accordance\nwith the result of the literature and the recent fit data. Furthermore, one\npattern could satisfy the experimental constraints at $1\\sigma$ level.\n", "  Fermilab is constructing the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) as the\ncenterpiece of the Accelerator R&D Program towards high-intensity circular\nmachines. One of the factors limiting the beam intensity in present circular\naccelerators is collective instabilities, which can be suppressed by a spread\nof betatron frequencies (tunes) through the Landau damping mechanism or by an\nexternal damper, if the instability is slow enough. The spread is usually\ncreated by octupole magnets, which introduce the tune dependence on the\namplitude and, in some cases, by a chromatic spread (tune dependence on\nparticle's momentum). The introduction of octupoles usually has both the\nbeneficial (improved Landau damping) and harmful properties, such as a resonant\nbehavior and a reduction of the dynamic aperture. One of the research goals at\nthe IOTA ring is to achieve a large betatron tune spread, while retaining a\nlarge dynamic aperture, using conventional octupole magnets in a special but\nrealistic accelerator configuration. In this paper, we present results of\ncomputer simulations of an electron beam in the IOTA by particle tracking and\nthe Frequency Map Analysis. The results show that the ring's octupole magnets\ncan be configured to provide a betatron tune shift of 0.08 (for particles at\nlarge amplitudes) with the dynamical aperture of over 20 beam sigma for a\n150-MeV electron beam. The influence of the synchrotron motion, lattice errors,\nand magnet imperfections is insignificant for the parameters and levels of\ntolerances set by the design of the ring. The described octupole insert could\nbe beneficial for enhancing Landau damping in high intensity machines.\n", "  The Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a formulation of Classical Mechanics equivalent\nto other formulations as Newton's equations, Lagrangian or Hamiltonian\nMechanics. It is particulary useful for the identification of conserved\nquantities of a mechanical system. The primordial observation of a geometric\nHamilton-Jacobi equation is that if a Hamiltonian vector field $X_{H}$ can be\nprojected into the configuration manifold by means of a 1-form $dW$, then the\nintegral curves of the projected vector field $X_{H}^{dW}$can be transformed\ninto integral curves of $X_{H}$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation. This interpretation has been applied to multiple\nsettings: in nonhonolomic, singular Lagrangian Mechanics and classical field\ntheories. Our aim is to apply the geometric Hamilton-Jacobi theory to systems\nendowed with a Nambu-Poisson structure. The Nambu-Poisson structure has shown\nits interest in the study physical systems described by several Hamiltonian\nfunctions. In this way, we will apply our theory to two interesting examples in\nthe Physics literature: the third-order Kummer-Schwarz equations and a system\nof $n$ copies of a first-order differential Riccati equation. From these\nexamples, we retrieve the original Nambu bracket in three dimensions and a\ngeneralization of the Nambu bracket to $n$ dimensions, respectively.\n", "  The 1D Vlasov-Poisson system is the simplest kinetic model for describing an\nelectrostatic collisonless plasma, and the BGK waves are its famous exact\nsteady solutions. They play an important role on the long time dynamics of a\ncollisionless plasma as potential \"final states\" or \"attractors\", thanks to\nmany numerical simulations and observations. Despite their importance, the\nexistence of stable BGK waves has been an open problem since their discovery in\n1958. In this paper, first linearly stable BGK waves are constructed near\nhomogeneous states.\n", "  We introduce a simple model of deterministic particles in weakly disordered\nmedia which exhibits a transition from normal to anomalous diffusion. The model\nconsists of a set of non-interacting overdamped particles moving on a\ndisordered potential. The disordered potential can be thought as a substrate\nhaving some \"defects\" scattered along a one-dimensional line. The distance\nbetween two contiguous defects is assumed to have a heavy-tailed distribution\nwith a given exponent $\\alpha$, which means that the defects along the\nsubstrate are scarce if $\\alpha$ is small. We prove that this system exhibits a\ntransition from normal to anomalous diffusion when the distribution exponent\n$\\alpha$ decreases, i.e., when the defects become scarcer. Thus we identify\nthree distinct scenarios: a normal diffusive phase for $\\alpha>2$, a\nsuperdiffusive phase for $1/2<\\alpha\\leq 2$, and a subdiffusive phase for\n$\\alpha \\leq 1/2$. We also prove that the particle current is finite for all\nthe values of $\\alpha$, which means that the transport is normal independently\nof the diffusion regime (normal, subdiffusive, or superdiffusive). We give\nanalytical expressions for the effective diffusion coefficient for the normal\ndiffusive phase and analytical expressions for the diffusion exponent in the\ncase of anomalous diffusion. We test all these predictions by means of\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Information-theoretical concepts are employed for the analysis of the\ninterplay between a transverse electric field $\\mathscr{E}$ applied to a\none-dimensional surface and Robin boundary condition (BC), which with the help\nof the extrapolation length $\\Lambda$ zeroes at the interface a linear\ncombination of the quantum mechanical wave function and its spatial derivative,\nand its influence on the properties of the structure. For doing this, exact\nanalytical solutions of the corresponding Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation are derived\nand used for calculating energies, dipole moments, position $S_x$ and momentum\n$S_k$ quantum information entropies and their Fisher information $I_x$ and\n$I_k$ and Onicescu information energies $O_x$ and $O_k$ counterparts. It is\nshown that the weak (strong) electric field changes the Robin wall into the\nDirichlet, $\\Lambda=0$ (Neumann, $\\Lambda=\\infty$), surface. This\ntransformation of the energy spectrum and associated waveforms in the growing\nfield defines an evolution of the quantum-information measures; for example, it\nis proved that for the Dirichlet and Neumann BCs the position (momentum)\nquantum information entropy varies as a positive (negative) natural logarithm\nof the electric intensity what results in their field-independent sum\n$S_x+S_k$. Analogously, at $\\Lambda=0$ and $\\Lambda=\\infty$ the position and\nmomentum Fisher informations (Onicescu energies) depend on the applied voltage\nas $\\mathscr{E}^{2/3}$ ($\\mathscr{E}^{1/3}$) and its inverse, respectively,\nleading to the field-independent product $I_xI_k$ ($O_xO_k$). Peculiarities of\ntheir transformations at the finite nonzero $\\Lambda$ are discussed and\nsimilarities and differences between the three quantum-information measures in\nthe electric field are highlighted with the special attention being paid to the\nconfiguration with the negative extrapolation length.\n", "  We use 3035 Herschel-SPIRE 500$\\mu$m sources from 20.3 sq deg of sky in the\nHerMES Lockman, ES1 and XMM-LSS areas to estimate the star-formation rate\ndensity at z = 1-6. 500 mu sources are associated first with 350 and 250 mu\nsources, and then with Spitzer 24 mu sources from the SWIRE photometric\nredshift catalogue. The infrared and submillimetre data are fitted with a set\nof radiative-transfer templates corresponding to cirrus (quiescent) and\nstarburst galaxies. Lensing candidates are removed via a set of colour-colour\nand colour-redshift constraints. Star-formation rates are found to extend from\n< 1 to 20,000 Mo/yr. Such high values were also seen in the all-sky IRAS Faint\nSource Survey. Star-formation rate functions are derived in a series of\nredshift bins from 0-6, combined with earlier far-infrared estimates, where\navailable, and fitted with a Saunders et al (1990) functional form. The\nstar-formation-rate density as a function of redshift is derived and compared\nwith other estimates. There is reasonable agreement with both infrared and\nultraviolet estimates for z < 3, but we find higher star-formation-rate\ndensities than ultraviolet estimates at z = 3-6. Given the considerable\nuncertainties in the submillimetre estimates, we can not rule out the\npossibility that the ultraviolet estimates are correct. But the possibility\nthat the ultraviolet estimates have seriously underestimated the contribution\nof dust-shrouded star-formation can also not be excluded.\n", "  We measure the gravitational lensing shear signal around dark matter halos\nhosting CMASS galaxies using light sources at $z\\sim 1$ (background galaxies)\nand at the surface of last scattering at $z\\sim 1100$ (the cosmic microwave\nbackground). The galaxy shear measurement uses data from the CFHTLenS survey,\nand the microwave background shear measurement uses data from the {\\it Planck}\nsatellite. The ratio of shears from these cross-correlations provides a purely\ngeometric distance measurement across the longest possible cosmological lever\narm. This is because the matter distribution around the halos, including\nuncertainties in galaxy bias and systematic errors such as miscentering,\ncancels in the ratio for halos in thin redshift slices. We measure this\ndistance ratio in three different redshift slices of the CMASS sample, and\ncombine them to obtain a $17\\%$ measurement of the distance ratio,\n$r=0.390^{+0.070}_{-0.062}$ at an effective redshift of $z=0.53$. This is\nconsistent with the predicted ratio from the {\\it Planck} best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology of $r=0.419$.\n", "  Air radon concentration measurement is useful for research on geophysical\neffects, but it is strongly sensitive to site geology and many geophysical and\nmicroclimatic processes such as wind, ventilation, air humidity and so on that\ninduce very big fluctuations on the concentration of radon in air. On the\ncontrary, monitoring the radon concentration in soil by measuring the thermal\nneutron flux reduces environmental effects. In this paper we report some\nexperimental results on the natural thermal neutron flux as well as the\nconcentration of air radon and its variations at 4300 m a.s.l. These results\nwere obtained with unshielded thermal neutron scintillation detectors\n(en-detectors) and radon monitors located inside the ARGO-YBJ experimental\nhall. The correlation of these variations with the lunar month and 1-year\nperiod is undoubtedly confirmed. A method for earthquakes prediction provided\nby a global net of the en-detectors is currently under study.\n", "  For a chaotic system pairs of initially close-by trajectories become\neventually fully uncorrelated on the attracting set. This process of\ndecorrelation may split into an initial exponential decrease, characterized by\nthe maximal Lyapunov exponent, and a subsequent diffusive process on the\nchaotic attractor causing the final loss of predictability. The time scales of\nboth processes can be either of the same or of very different orders of\nmagnitude. In the latter case the two trajectories linger within a finite but\nsmall distance (with respect to the overall extent of the attractor) for\nexceedingly long times and therefore remain partially predictable.\n  Tests for distinguishing chaos from laminar flow widely use the time\nevolution of inter-orbital correlations as an indicator. Standard tests however\nyield mostly ambiguous results when it comes to distinguish partially\npredictable chaos and laminar flow, which are characterized respectively by\nattractors of fractally broadened braids and limit cycles. For a resolution we\nintroduce a novel 0-1 indicator for chaos based on the cross-distance scaling\nof pairs of initially close trajectories, showing that this test robustly\ndiscriminates chaos, including partially predictable chaos, from laminar flow.\nOne can use furthermore the finite time cross-correlation of pairs of initially\nclose trajectories to distinguish, for a complete classification, also between\nstrong and partially predictable chaos. We are thus able to identify laminar\nflow as well as strong and partially predictable chaos in a 0-1 manner solely\nfrom the properties of pairs of trajectories.\n", "  In this investigation we study extreme vortex states defined as\nincompressible velocity fields with prescribed enstrophy $\\mathcal{E}_0$ which\nmaximize the instantaneous rate of growth of enstrophy $d\\mathcal{E}/dt$. We\nprovide {an analytic} characterization of these extreme vortex states in the\nlimit of vanishing enstrophy $\\mathcal{E}_0$ and, in particular, show that the\nTaylor-Green vortex is in fact a local maximizer of $d\\mathcal{E} / dt$ {in\nthis limit}. For finite values of enstrophy, the extreme vortex states are\ncomputed numerically by solving a constrained variational optimization problem\nusing a suitable gradient method. In combination with a continuation approach,\nthis allows us to construct an entire family of maximizing vortex states\nparameterized by their enstrophy. We also confirm the findings of the seminal\nstudy by Lu & Doering (2008) that these extreme vortex states saturate (up to a\nnumerical prefactor) the fundamental bound $d\\mathcal{E} / dt < C \\,\n\\mathcal{E}^3$, for some constant $C > 0$. The time evolution corresponding to\nthese extreme vortex states leads to a larger growth of enstrophy than the\ngrowth achieved by any of the commonly used initial conditions with the same\nenstrophy $\\mathcal{E}_0$. However, based on several different diagnostics,\nthere is no evidence of any tendency towards singularity formation in finite\ntime. Finally, we discuss possible physical reasons why the initially large\ngrowth of enstrophy is not sustained for longer times.\n", "  We investigate the effect of external magnetic fields on equilibration in the\nimproved holographic QCD theory in the deconfined phase using the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. In particular we calculate the quasinormal mode spectra in the\ncorresponding black brane solutions and study their dependence on temperature,\nmomentum and magnetic field, both in the scalar and the shear channels. We find\ncomplex patterns in the motion of quasinormal modes on the complex plane,\nincluding certain cross overs between the lowest lying modes under varying\nmagnetic field, momentum and temperature. We also discover a critical value of\nthe magnetic field $B_c$ above which the hydrodynamic approximation breaks\ndown, as the imaginary part of the first excited quasi-normal mode in the shear\nchannel becomes smaller than that of the hydro mode.\n", "  Planar switched system with dead-zone are analyzed. In particular, we\nconsider the effects of perturbation of the linear control law from purely\npositional to position-velocity control. This type of perturbation leads to a\nnovel Hopf-like discontinuity induced bifurcation. We show that this\nbifurcation leads to the creation of small scale limit cycle attractors, which\nscale as the square root of the bifurcation parameter. We note that a Hopf-like\nbifurcation analyzed in non-smooth systems is characterized by a linear scaling\nlaw. We then investigate numerically a planar switched system with positional\nfeedback law, dead-zone and time delay in the switching function. Using the\nsame parameter values as for the switched system without delay in the switching\nfunction, we show numerically a Hopf-like bifurcation scenario which matches\nqualitatively and quantitatively with the scenario analyzed for the non-delayed\nsystem.\n", "  Transfer of quantum information between physical systems of a different\nnature is a central matter in quantum technologies. Particularly challenging is\nthe transfer between discrete- and continuous degrees of freedom of various\nharmonic oscillator systems. Here we implement a protocol for teleporting a\ncontinuous-variable optical qubit, encoded by means of coherent states, onto a\ndiscrete-variable, single-rail qubit - a superposition of the vacuum- and\nsingle-photon optical states - via a hybrid entangled resource. We test our\nprotocol on coherent states of different phases and obtain the teleported qubit\nwith a fidelity of $0.83\\pm0.04$. We also find that the phase of the resulting\nqubit varies consistently with that of the input, having a standard deviation\nof $3.8^\\circ$ from the target value. Our work opens up the way to wide\napplication of quantum information processing techniques where discrete- and\ncontinuous-variable encodings are combined within the same optical circuit.\n", "  We calculate the dispersion relations for magnon waves on a periodic chain of\nspherical or cylindrical Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) particles. We use the\nquasistatic approximation, appropriate when $kd \\ll 1$, where $k$ is the wave\nnumber and $d$ the interparticle spacing. In this regime, because of the\nmagnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the localized magnetic excitations\non neighboring particles, dispersive magnon waves can propagate along the\nchain. The waves are analogous to plasmonic waves generated by electric\ndipole-dipole interactions between plasmons on neighboring metallic particles.\nThe magnon waves can be longitudinal ($L$), transverse ($T$), or elliptically\npolarized. We find that a linearly polarized magnon wave undergoes a Faraday\nrotation as it propagates along the chain. The amount of Faraday rotation can\nbe tuned by varying the off-diagonal component of the permeability tensor. We\nalso discuss the possibility of wireless power transmission along the chain\nusing these coupled magnon waves.\n", "  Optical properties of a series of Gd2O3 doped sodium zinc tellurite\n[xGd2O3-(0.8-x) TeO2-0.1Na2O-0.1ZnO] glasses prepared by conventional melt\nquenching method have been studied. UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used in the\nintegrating sphere mode at room temperature to study the effect of Gd2O3 doping\non the optical band gap, refractive index, dielectric constant and\nsusceptibility within the wavelength range from 230-800 nm. Density is measured\nusing Archimedes principle for the calculation of molar volume, molar\nrefraction, polarizability and metallization criterion of the glasses.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the node degree and energy $E$ on the electronic\nwave function for regular and irregular structures, namely, regular lattices,\ndisordered percolation clusters, and complex networks. We evaluate the\ndependence of the quantum probability for each site on its degree. For\nbi-regular structures, we prove analytically that the probability $P_k(E)$ of\nfinding the particle on any site with $k$ neighbors is independent of $E$. For\nmore general structures, the dependency of $P_k(E)$ on $E$ is discussed by\ntaking into account exact results on a one-dimensional semi-regular chain:\n$P_k(E)$ is large for small values of $E$ when $k$ is also small, and its\nmaximum values shift towards large values of $|E|$ with increasing $k$.\nNumerical evaluations of $P_k(E)$ for two different types of percolation\nclusters and the Apollonian network suggest that this feature might be\ngenerally valid\n", "  Defects usually play an important role in tuning and modifying various\nproperties of semiconducting or insulating materials. Therefore we study the\nimpact of point and line defects on the electronic structure and optical\nproperties of MoS2 monolayers using density-functional methods. The different\ntypes of defects form electronic states that are spatially localized on the\ndefect. The strongly localized nature is reflected in weak electronic\ninteractions between individual point or line defect and a weak dependence of\nthe defect formation energy on the defect concentration or line defect\nseparation. In the electronic energy spectrum the defect states occur as deep\nlevels in the band gap, as shallow levels very close to the band edges, as well\nas levels in-between the bulk states. Due to their strongly localized nature,\nall states of point defects are sharply peaked in energy. Periodic line defects\nform nearly dispersionless one-dimensional band structures and the related\nspectral features are also strongly peaked. The electronic structure of the\nmonolayer system is quite robust and it is well preserved for point defect\nconcentrations of up to 6%. The impact of point defects on the optical\nabsorption for concentrations of 1% and below is found to be very small. For\nhigher defect concentrations molybdenum vacancies were found to quench the\noverall absorption and sulfur defects lead to sharp absorption peaks below the\nabsorption edge of the ideal monolayer. For line defects, we did not find a\nconsiderable impact on the absorption spectrum. These results support recent\nexperiments on defective transition metal chalcogenides.\n", "  We present $\\texttt{Maxent}$, a tool for performing analytic continuation of\nspectral functions using the maximum entropy method. The code operates on\ndiscrete imaginary axis datasets (values with uncertainties) and transforms\nthis input to the real axis. The code works for imaginary time and Matsubara\nfrequency data and implements the 'Legendre' representation of finite\ntemperature Green's functions. It implements a variety of kernels, default\nmodels, and grids for continuing bosonic, fermionic, anomalous, and other data.\nOur implementation is licensed under GPLv2 and extensively documented. This\npaper shows the use of the programs in detail.\n", "  Frequently we revise our first opinions after talking over with other\nindividuals because we get convinced. Argumentation is a verbal and social\nprocess aimed at convincing. It includes conversation and persuasion. In this\ncase, the agreement is reached because the new arguments are incorporated. In\nthis paper we deal with a simple model of opinion formation with such\npersuasion dynamics, and we find the exact analytical solutions for both, long\nand short range interactions. A novel theoretical approach has been used in\norder to solve the master equations of the model with non-local kernels.\nSimulation results demonstrate an excellent agreement with results obtained by\nthe theoretical estimation.\n", "  A fully predictive Kinetic Collective Model using first principles phonon\nspectra and relaxation times is presented. Thermal conductivity values obtained\nfor Si, Ge, C (diamond) and GaAs in a wide range of sizes and temperatures have\ngood agreement with experimental data without the use of any fitting parameter.\nThis validation of the model open the door to discuss how the precise\ncombination of kinetic and collective contributions to heat transport could\nprovide a useful framework to interpret recent complex experiments displaying\nnon-Fourier behavior.\n", "  We give asymptotics for Einstein vacuum equations in wave coordinates with\nsmall asymptotically flat data. We show that the behavior is wave like at null\ninfinity and homogeneous towards time like infinity. We use the asymptotics to\nshow that the outgoing null hypersurfaces approach the Schwarzschild ones for\nthe same mass and that the radiated energy is equal to the initial mass.\n", "  In this paper we study the stochastic quantization problem on the two\ndimensional torus and establish ergodicity for the solutions. Furthermore, we\nprove a characterization of the $\\Phi^4_2$ quantum field on the torus in terms\nof its density under translation. We also deduce that the $\\Phi^4_2$ quantum\nfield on the torus is an extreme point in the set of all $L$-symmetrizing\nmeasures, where $L$ is the corresponding generator.\n", "  In the classification of stationary solutions in extended supergravities with\nsymmetric scalar manifolds, the nilpotent orbits of a real symmetric pair play\nan important role. In this paper we discuss two approaches to determining the\nnilpotent orbits of a real symmetric pair. We apply our methods to an explicit\nexample, and thereby classify the nilpotent orbits of SL_2(R)^4 acting on the\nfourth tensor power of the natural 2-dimensional SL_2(R)-module. This makes it\npossible to classify all stationary solutions of the so-called STU-supergravity\nmodel.\n", "  One can obtain exact information about Virasoro conformal blocks by\nanalytically continuing the correlators of degenerate operators. We argued in\nrecent work that this technique can be used to explicitly resolve information\nloss problems in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. In this paper we use the technique to perform\ncalculations in the small $1/c \\propto G_N$ expansion: (1) we prove the\nall-orders resummation of logarithmic factors $\\propto \\frac{1}{c} \\log z$ in\nthe Lorentzian regime, demonstrating that $1/c$ corrections directly shift\nLyapunov exponents associated with chaos, as claimed in prior work, (2) we\nperform another all-orders resummation in the limit of large $c$ with fixed\n$cz$, interpolating between the early onset of chaos and late time behavior,\n(3) we explicitly compute the Virasoro vacuum block to order $1/c^2$ and\n$1/c^3$, corresponding to $2$ and $3$ loop calculations in AdS$_3$, and (4) we\nderive the heavy-light vacuum blocks in theories with $\\mathcal{N}=1,2$\nsuperconformal symmetry.\n", "  We consider stationary stochastic processes arising from dynamical systems by\nevaluating a given observable along the orbits of the system. We focus on the\nextremal behaviour of the process, which is related to the entrance in certain\nregions of the phase space, which correspond to neighbourhoods of the maximal\nset $\\mathcal M$, i.e. the set of points where the observable is maximised. The\nmain novelty here is the fact that we consider that the set $\\mathcal M$ may\nhave a countable number of points, which are associated by belonging to the\norbit of a certain point, and may have accumulation points. In order to prove\nthe existence of distributional limits and study the intensity of clustering,\ngiven by the Extremal Index, we generalise the conditions previously introduced\nin \\cite{FFT12,FFT15}.\n", "  The most effective use of data from current and upcoming large scale\nstructure~(LSS) and CMB observations requires the ability to predict the\nclustering of LSS with very high precision. The Effective Field Theory of Large\nScale Structure (EFTofLSS) provides an instrument for performing analytical\ncomputations of LSS observables with the required precision in the mildly\nnonlinear regime. In this paper, we develop efficient implementations of these\ncomputations that allow for an exploration of their dependence on cosmological\nparameters. They are based on two ideas. First, once an observable has been\ncomputed with high precision for a reference cosmology, for a new cosmology the\nsame can be easily obtained with comparable precision just by adding the\ndifference in that observable, evaluated with much less precision. Second, most\ncosmologies of interest are sufficiently close to the Planck best-fit cosmology\nthat observables can be obtained from a Taylor expansion around the reference\ncosmology. These ideas are implemented for the matter power spectrum at two\nloops and are released as public codes. When applied to cosmologies that are\nwithin 3$\\sigma$ of the Planck best-fit model, the first method evaluates the\npower spectrum in a few minutes on a laptop, with results that have 1\\% or\nbetter precision, while with the Taylor expansion the same quantity is\ninstantly generated with similar precision. The ideas and codes we present may\neasily be extended for other applications or higher-precision results.\n", "  Superintegrable systems on a symplectic manifold conventionally are\nconsidered. However, their definition implies a rather restrictive condition\n2n=k+m where 2n is a dimension of a symplectic manifold, k is a dimension of a\npointwise Lie algebra of a superintegrable system, and m is its corank. To\nsolve this problem, we aim to consider partially superintegrable systems on\nPoisson manifolds where k+m is the rank of a compatible Poisson structure. The\naccording extensions of the Mishchenko-Fomenko theorem on generalized\naction-angle coordinates is formulated.\n", "  An optimal-velocity (OV) model describes car motion on a single lane road. In\nparticular, near to the boundary signifying the onset of traffic jams, this\nmodel reduces to a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation using asymptotic\nanalysis. Previously, the KdV soliton solution has then been found and compared\nto numerical results (see Muramatsu and Nagatani (1999)). Here, we instead\napply modulation theory to this perturbed KdV equation to obtain at leading\norder, the modulated cnoidal wave solution. At the next order, the Whitham\nequations are derived, which have been modified due to the equation\nperturbation terms. Next, from this modulation system, a family of spatially\nperiodic cnoidal waves are identified that characterise vehicle headway\ndistance. Then, for this set of solutions, we establish the relationship\nbetween the wave speed and the modulation term, which is dependent upon the\nnumber of oscillations over the spatial domain. This analysis is confirmed with\ncomparisons to numerical solutions of the OV model.\n", "  We discuss the possible factorization of the tensor asymmetry $A^T_d$\nmeasured for polarized deuteron targets within a relativistic framework. We\ndefine a reduced asymmetry and find that factorization holds only in plane wave\nimpulse approximation and if p-waves are neglected. Our numerical results show\na strong factorization breaking once final state interactions are included. We\nalso compare the d-wave content of the wave functions with the size of the\nfactored, reduced asymmetry and find that there is no systematic relationship\nof this quantity to the d-wave probability of the various wave functions.\n", "  We examine the $h\\to \\mu\\tau$ and muon g-2 in the exact alignment limit of\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model. In this case, the couplings of the SM-like Higgs to\nthe SM particles are the same as the Higgs couplings in the SM at the tree\nlevel, and the tree-level lepton-flavor-violating coupling $h\\mu\\tau$ is\nabsent. We assume the lepton-flavor-violating $\\mu\\tau$ excess observed by CMS\nto be respectively from the other neutral Higgses, $H$ and $A$, which almost\ndegenerates with the SM-like Higgs at the 125 GeV. After imposing the relevant\ntheoretical constraints and experimental constraints from the precision\nelectroweak data, $B$-meson decays, $\\tau$ decays and Higgs searches, we find\nthat the muon g-2 anomaly and $\\mu\\tau$ excess favor the small lepton Yukawa\ncoupling and top Yukawa coupling of the non-SM-like Higgs around 125 GeV, and\nthe lepton-flavor-violating coupling is sensitive to another heavy neutral\nHiggs mass. In addition, if the $\\mu\\tau$ excess is from $H$ around 125 GeV,\nthe experimental data of the heavy Higgs decaying into $\\mu\\tau$ favor\n$m_A>230$ GeV for a relatively large $H\\bar{t}t$ coupling.\n", "  The standard method of \"measuring\" quantum wavefunction is the technique of\n{\\it indirect} quantum state tomography. Owing to conceptual novelty and\npossible advantages, an alternative {\\it direct} scheme was proposed and\ndemonstrated recently in quantum optics system. In this work we present a study\non the direct scheme of measuring qubit state in the circuit QED system, based\non weak measurement and weak value concepts. To be applied to generic parameter\nconditions, our formulation and analysis are carried out for finite strength\nweak measurement, and in particular beyond the bad-cavity and weak-response\nlimits. The proposed study is accessible to the present state-of-the-art\ncircuit-QED experiments.\n", "  We present some computer simulations run on a stochastic CA (cellular\nautomaton). The CA simulates a gas of particles which are in a channel, the\ninterval $[1,L]$ in $\\mathbb Z$, but also in \"reservoirs\" $\\mathcal R_1$ and\n$\\mathcal R_2$. The evolution in the channel simulates a lattice gas with\nKawasaki dynamics with attractive Kac interactions, the temperature is chosen\nsmaller than the mean field critical one. There are also exchanges of particles\nbetween the channel and the reservoirs and among reservoirs. When the rate of\nexchanges among reservoirs is in a suitable interval the CA reaches an\napparently stationary state with a non zero current, for different choices of\nthe initial condition the current changes sign. We have a quite satisfactory\ntheory of the phenomenon but we miss a full mathematical proof.\n", "  A $6.8\\,\\sigma$ anomaly has been reported in the opening angle and invariant\nmass distributions of $e^+e^-$ pairs produced in ${^8Be}$ nuclear transitions.\nIt has been shown that a protophobic fifth force mediated by a\n$17\\,\\textrm{MeV}$ gauge boson $X$ with pure vector current interactions can\nexplain the data through the decay of an excited state to the ground state,\n${^8Be^*} \\to {^8Be}\\, X$, and then the followed saturating decay $X \\to\ne^+e^-$. In this work we propose a renormalizable model to realize this fifth\nforce. Although axial-vector current interactions also exist in our model,\ntheir contributions cancel out in the iso-scalar interaction for ${^8Be^*} \\to\n{^8Be} \\,X$. Within the allowed parameter space, this model can alleviate the\n$(g-2)_\\mu$ anomaly problem and can be probed by the LHCb experiment. Several\nother implications are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the finite-density phase diagram of a non-abelian SU(2)\nlattice gauge theory in (1+1)-dimensions using tensor network methods. We\nnumerically characterise the phase diagram as a function of the matter filling\nand of the matter-field coupling, identifying different phases, some of them\nappearing only at finite densities. For weak matter-field coupling we find a\nmeson BCS liquid phase, which is confirmed by second-order analytical\nperturbation theory. At unit filling and for strong coupling, the system\nundergoes a phase transition to a charge density wave of single-site (spin-0)\nmesons via spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. At finite densities, the\nchiral symmetry is restored almost everywhere, and the meson BCS liquid becomes\na simple liquid at strong couplings, with the exception of filling two-thirds,\nwhere a charge density wave of mesons spreading over neighbouring sites\nappears. Finally, we identify two tri-critical points between the chiral and\nthe two liquid phases which are compatible with a $SU(2)_2$\nWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model. Here we do not perform the continuum limit\nbut we explicitly address the global $U(1)$ charge conservation symmetry.\n", "  BRIKEN is a complex detection system to be installed at the RIB-facility of\nthe RIKEN Nishina Center. It is aimed at the detection of heavy-ion implants,\n$\\beta$-particles, $\\gamma$-rays and $\\beta$-delayed neutrons. The whole\ndetection setup involves the Advanced Implantation Detection Array (AIDA), two\nHPGe Clover detectors and a large set of 166 counters of 3He embedded in a\nhigh-density polyethylene matrix. This article reports on a novel methodology\ndeveloped for the conceptual design and optimisation of the 3He-tubes array,\naiming at the best possible performance in terms of neutron detection. The\nalgorithm is based on a geometric representation of two selected parameters of\nmerit, namely, average neutron detection efficiency and efficiency flatness, as\na function of a reduced number of geometric variables. The response of the\ndetection system itself, for each configuration, is obtained from a systematic\nMC-simulation implemented realistically in Geant4. This approach has been found\nto be particularly useful. On the one hand, due to the different types and\nlarge number of 3He-tubes involved and, on the other hand, due to the\nadditional constraints introduced by the ancillary detectors for charged\nparticles and gamma-rays. Empowered by the robustness of the algorithm, we have\nbeen able to design a versatile detection system, which can be easily\nre-arranged into a compact mode in order to maximize the neutron detection\nperformance, at the cost of the gamma-ray sensitivity. In summary, we have\ndesigned a system which shows, for neutron energies up to 1(5) MeV, a rather\nflat and high average efficiency of 68.6%(64%) and 75.7%(71%) for the hybrid\nand compact modes, respectively. The performance of the BRIKEN system has been\nalso quantified realistically by means of MC-simulations made with different\nneutron energy distributions.\n", "  We study the optical properties of quantum dipole emitters coupled to\nhyperbolic metamaterial nano-resonators using a semi-analytical quasinormal\nmode approach. We show that coupling to metamaterial nano-resonators can lead\nto significant Purcell enhancements that are nearly an order of magnitude\nlarger than those of plasmonic resonators with comparable geometry. However,\nthe associated single photon output $\\beta$-factors are extremely low (around\n10$\\%$), far smaller than those of comparable sized metallic resonators\n(70$\\%$). Using a quasinormal mode expansion of the photon Green function, we\ndescribe how the low $\\beta$-factors are due to increased Ohmic quenching\narising from redshifted resonances, larger quality factors, and stronger\nconfinement of light within the metal. In contrast to current wisdom, these\nresults suggest that hyperbolic metamaterial nano-structures make poor choices\nfor single photon sources.\n", "  A causal scenario is a graph that describes the cause and effect\nrelationships between all relevant variables in an experiment. A scenario is\ndeemed `not interesting' if there is no device-independent way to distinguish\nthe predictions of classical physics from any generalised probabilistic theory\n(including quantum mechanics). Conversely, an interesting scenario is one in\nwhich there exists a gap between the predictions of different operational\nprobabilistic theories, as occurs for example in Bell-type experiments. Henson,\nLal and Pusey (HLP) recently proposed a sufficient condition for a causal\nscenario to not be interesting. In this paper we supplement their analysis with\nsome new techniques and results. We first show that existing graphical\ntechniques due to Evans can be used to confirm by inspection that many graphs\nare interesting without having to explicitly search for inequality violations.\nFor three exceptional cases -- the graphs numbered 15,16,20 in HLP -- we show\nthat there exist non-Shannon type entropic inequalities that imply these graphs\nare interesting. In doing so, we find that existing methods of entropic\ninequalities can be greatly enhanced by conditioning on the specific values of\ncertain variables.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers MXY (M=Mo, W, X(not equal\nto)Y=S, Se, Te) are two-dimensional polar semiconductors. Setting WSeTe\nmonolayer as an example and using density functional theory calculations, we\ninvestigate the manipulation of Rashba spin orbit coupling (SOC) in the MXY\nmonolayer. It is found that the intrinsic out-of-plane electric field due to\nthe mirror symmetry breaking induces the large Rashba spin splitting around the\nGamma point, which, however, can be easily tuned by applying the in-plane\nbiaxial strain. Through a relatively small strain (from -2% to 2%), a large\ntunability (from around -50% to 50%) of Rashba SOC can be obtained due to the\nmodified orbital overlap, which can in turn modulate the intrinsic electric\nfield. The orbital selective external potential method further confirms the\nsignificance of the orbital overlap between W-dz2 and Se-pz in Rashba SOC. In\naddition, we also explore the influence of the external electric field on\nRashba SOC in the WSeTe monolayer, which is less effective than strain. The\nlarge Rashba spin splitting, together with the valley spin splitting in MXY\nmonolayers may make a special contribution to semiconductor spintronics and\nvalleytronics.\n", "  In this paper we propose two simple minimal Higgs inflation scenarios through\na simple modification of the Higgs potential, as opposed to the usual\nnon-minimal Higgs-gravity coupling prescription. The modification is done in\nsuch a way that it creates a flat plateau for a huge range of field values at\nthe inflationary energy scale $\\mu \\simeq (\\lambda)^{1/4} \\alpha$. Assuming the\nperturbative Higgs quartic coupling, $\\lambda \\simeq {\\cal O}(1)$, for both the\nmodels inflation energy scale turned out to be $\\mu \\simeq (10^{14}, 10^{15})$\nGeV, and prediction of all the cosmologically relevant quantities,\n$(n_s,r,dn_s^k)$, fit extremely well with observations made by PLANCK.\nConsidering observed central value of the scalar spectral index, $n_s= 0.968$,\nour two models predict efolding number, $N = (52,47)$. Within a wide range of\nviable parameter space, we found that the prediction of tensor to scalar ratio\n$r (\\leq 10^{-5})$ is far below the current experimental sensitivity to be\nobserved in the near future. The prediction for the running of scalar spectral\nindex, $dn_s^k$, approximately remains the same as was predicted by the usual\nchaotic and quartic inflation scenario. We also the computed the background\nfield dependent unitarity scale $\\Lambda(h)$, which turned out to be much\nlarger than the aforementioned inflationary energy.\n", "  In the light of the recently discussed mechanism for suppression of\nsuperconductivity in multi-orbital systems called inter-orbital effect, here we\nextend our analysis of the upper critical field in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ now under\nstrain. We show that the presence of the standard orbital effect and the new\nmechanism can consistently account for the qualitative changes observed in the\nupper critical field for the strained system, in particular, combining the\noverall enhancement of the critical field with the reduction in the anisotropy.\nThe proposed picture holds for a triplet superconducting state, showing that a\nsinglet state is not the only possibility to account for the observations. We\nsuggest further experiments in order to clarify our understanding about the\nsuperconducting phase of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.\n", "  The lattice thermal conductivity of thermoelectric material CuInTe2 is\npredicted using classical molecular dynamics simulations, where a simple but\neffective Morse-type interatomic potential is constructed by fitting\nfirst-principles total energy calculations. In a broad temperature range from\n300 to 900 K, our simulated results agree well with those measured\nexperimentally, as well as those obtained from phonon Boltzmann transport\nequation. By introducing the Cd impurity and Cu vacancy, the thermal\nconductivity of CuInTe2 can be effectively reduced to further enhance the\nthermoelectric performance of this chalcopyrite compound.\n", "  We point out that the quantum Grad's 13-moment system [R. Yano, Physica A:\nStatistical Mechanics and its Applications, 416:231-241, 2014] is lack of\nglobal hyperbolicity, and even worse, the thermodynamic equilibrium is not an\ninterior point of the hyperbolicity region of the system. To remedy this\nproblem, by fully considering Grad's expansion, we split the expansion into the\nequilibrium part and the non-equilibrium part, and propose a regularization for\nthe system with the help of the new theory developed in [Z. Cai et al., SIAM J.\nAppl. Math., 75(5):2001-2023, 2015, Y. Fan, J. Stat. Phys., 161(4), 2015]. This\nprovides us a new model which is hyperbolic for all admissible thermodynamic\nstates, and meanwhile preserves the approximate accuracy of the original\nsystem. It should be noted that this procedure is not a trivial application of\nthe theory in [Z. Cai et al., SIAM J. Appl. Math., 75(5):2001-2023, 2015, Y.\nFan, J. Stat. Phys., 161(4), 2015].\n", "  We prove the existence of orbitally stable ground states to NLS with a\npartial confinement together with qualitative and symmetry properties. This\nresult is obtained for nonlinearities which are $L^2$-supercritical, in\nparticular we cover the physically relevant cubic case. The equation that we\nconsider is the limit case of the cigar-shaped model in BEC.\n", "  In this paper by using geometric techniques, we provide upper bounds for the\nPoincar\\'e recurrence time of a quantum mixed state with discrete spectrum of\nenergies. In the case of discrete but finite spectrum we obtain two type of\nupper bounds; one of them depends on the uncertainty in the energy, and the\nother depends only on the (finite) number of states. In the case of discrete\nbut non-finite spectrum we obtain in the same way two upper bounds defining the\nnumber of relevant states according to an statistical measurement. These bounds\ncorrespond to two different situations in the quantum recurrence process. The\nfirst bound is a recurrence time estimation purely quantum, while the other\nbound that is related with the number of relevant states survives in the\nclassical limit.\n", "  We consider two ensembles of 0-1 nxn matrices. The first is the set of all\nnxn matrices with entries zeroes and ones such that all column sums and all row\nsums equal r, uniformly weighted. The second is the set of nxn matrices with\nzero and one entries where the probability that any given entry is one is r/n,\nthe probabilities of the individual entries being i.i.d.'s. Calling the two\nexpectations E and E_B respectively, we develop a formal relation\n  E(perm(A))=E_B(perm(A)) exp( sum T_i ) (A1)\n  We use two well known approximating ensembles to E, E_1 and E_2. Replacing E\nby either E_1 or E_2 we can evaluate all terms in (A1). For either E_1 or E_2\nthe T_i have amazing properties. We conjecture that all these properties also\nhold for E. We carry through a similar development treating E(perm_m(A)), with\nm proportional to n, in place of E(perm(A)).\n", "  Leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) are widely used as single-point-fed linear antenna\narrays. The extension of LWAs to 2D implies that they can be used as\nsingle-point-fed 2D antenna arrays without requiring a complex feeding network.\nHowever, generating a pencil beam from 2D LWAs is not straightforward and due\ncare has to be taken for the design of the LWA. On the other hand,\ntransmission-line (TL) grids have demonstrated interesting behaviors, such as\nan effective negative refractive index and growing of evanescent waves. In this\npaper, a singlepoint-fed TL-grid 2D Dirac leaky-wave antenna (DLWA) design is\nproposed that generates a pencil beam at both broadside and slightly tilted\nangles. The TL-grid unit cell is analytically treated in light of its\nscattering and impedance matrices. The optimized TL-grid unit cell is shown to\nexhibit a closed bandgap in the dispersion relation which is also linearly\nvarying with frequency (hence it is a DLWA). The proposed 2D DLWA design is\nfabricated and the experimental results are presented.\n", "  We theoretically study the current-induced spin torque in antiferromagnetic\ntunnel junctions, composed of two semi-infinite antiferromagnetic layers\nseparated by a tunnel barrier, in both clean and disordered regimes. We find\nthat the torque enabling the electrical manipulation of the N\\'eel\nantiferromagnetic order parameter is out of plane $\\sim {\\bf n}\\times{\\bf p}$,\nwhile the torque competing with the antiferromagnetic exchange is in-plane\n$\\sim {\\bf n}\\times({\\bf p}\\times{\\bf n})$. Here, ${\\bf { p}}$ and ${\\bf { n}}$\nare the N\\'eel order parameter direction of the reference and free layers,\nrespectively. Their bias dependence shows similar behavior as in ferromagnetic\ntunnel junctions, the in-plane torque being mostly linear in bias while the\nout-of-plane torque is quadratic. Most importantly, we find that the spin\ntransfer torque in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions is much more robust\nagainst disorder than in antiferromagnetic metallic spin-valves due to the\ntunneling nature of spin transport.\n", "  We report the discovery of a transiting exoplanet, KELT-11b, orbiting the\nbright ($V=8.0$) subgiant HD 93396. A global analysis of the system shows that\nthe host star is an evolved subgiant star with $T_{\\rm eff} = 5370\\pm51$ K,\n$M_{*} = 1.438_{-0.052}^{+0.061} M_{\\odot}$, $R_{*} = 2.72_{-0.17}^{+0.21}\nR_{\\odot}$, log $g_*= 3.727_{-0.046}^{+0.040}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.180\\pm0.075$.\nThe planet is a low-mass gas giant in a $P = 4.736529\\pm0.00006$ day orbit,\nwith $M_{P} = 0.195\\pm0.018 M_J$, $R_{P}= 1.37_{-0.12}^{+0.15} R_J$, $\\rho_{P}\n= 0.093_{-0.024}^{+0.028}$ g cm$^{-3}$, surface gravity log ${g_{P}} =\n2.407_{-0.086}^{+0.080}$, and equilibrium temperature $T_{eq} =\n1712_{-46}^{+51}$ K. KELT-11 is the brightest known transiting exoplanet host\nin the southern hemisphere by more than a magnitude, and is the 6th brightest\ntransit host to date. The planet is one of the most inflated planets known,\nwith an exceptionally large atmospheric scale height (2763 km), and an\nassociated size of the expected atmospheric transmission signal of 5.6%. These\nattributes make the KELT-11 system a valuable target for follow-up and\natmospheric characterization, and it promises to become one of the benchmark\nsystems for the study of inflated exoplanets.\n", "  The blind structured illumination microscopy (SIM) strategy proposed in\n(Mudry et al., 1992) is fully re-founded in this paper, unveiling the central\nrole of the sparsity of the illumination patterns in the mechanism that drives\nsuper-resolution in the method. A numerical analysis shows that the resolving\npower of the method can be further enhanced with optimized one-photon or\ntwo-photon speckle illuminations. A much improved numerical implementation is\nprovided for the reconstruction problem under the image positivity constraint.\nThis algorithm rests on a new preconditioned proximal iteration faster than\nexisting solutions, paving the way to 3D and real-time 2D reconstruction\n", "  We describe a directed search for continuous gravitational waves in data from\nthe sixth LIGO science run. The target was the nearby globular cluster NGC 6544\nat a distance of 2.7 kpc. The search covered a broad band of frequencies along\nwith first and second frequency derivatives for a fixed sky position. The\nsearch coherently integrated data from the two LIGO interferometers over a time\nspan of 9.2 days using the matched-filtering F-statistic. We found no\ngravitational-wave signals and set 95% confidence upper limits as stringent as\n6.0 X 10^{-25} on intrinsic strain and 8.5 X 10^{-6} on fiducial ellipticity.\nThese values beat the indirect limits from energy conservation for stars with\ncharacteristic spindown ages older than 300 years and are within the range of\ntheoretical predictions for possible neutron-star ellipticities. An important\nfeature of this search was use of a barycentric resampling algorithm which\nsubstantially reduced computational cost; this method will be used extensively\nin searches of Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector data.\n", "  In this paper we consider tree-level gauge invariant off-shell amplitudes\n(Wilson line form factors) in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. For the off-shell amplitudes\nwith one leg off-shell we present a conjecture for their Grassmannian integral\nrepresentation in spinor helicity, twistor and momentum twistor\nparameterizations. The presented conjecture is successfully checked against\nBCFW results for MHV$_n$, NMHV$_4$ and NMHV$_5$ off-shell amplitudes. We have\nalso verified that our Grassmannian integral representation correctly\nreproduces soft (on-shell) limit for the off-shell gluon momentum. It is shown\nthat the (deformed) off-shell amplitude expressions could be also obtained\nusing quantum inverse scattering method for auxiliary $gl(4|4)$ super spin\nchain.\n", "  The doubly special relativity (DSR) theories are suggested in order to\nincorporate an observer-independent length scale in special theory of\nrelativity. The Magueijo-Smolin proposal of DSR is realizable through a\nparticular form of the noncommutative (NC) spacetime (known as\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime) in which the Lorentz symmetry is preserved. In\nthis framework, the NC parameter $\\kappa$ provides the origin of natural cutoff\nenergy scale. Using a nonlinear deformed relativistic dispersion relation along\nwith the Lorentz transformations, we investigate some phenomenological facets\nof two-body collision problem (without creation of new particles) in a\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime. By treating an elastic scattering problem, we\nstudy effects of the Planck scale energy cutoff on some relativistic\nkinematical properties of this scattering problem. The results are challenging\nin the sense that as soon as one turns on the $\\kappa$-spacetime extension, the\nnature of the two-body collision alters from elastic to inelastic one. It is\nshown also that a significant kinematical variable involving in heavy ion\ncollisions, the rapidity, is not essentially an additive quantity under a\nsequence of the nonlinear representation of the Lorentz transformations.\n", "  We show that all smooth Killing horizons with compact horizon sections of\n4-dimensional gauged N=2 supergravity coupled to any number of vector\nmultiplets preserve $2 c_1({\\cal K})+4 \\ell$ supersymmetries, where ${\\cal K}$\nis a pull-back of the Hodge bundle of the special K\\\"ahler manifold on the\nhorizon spatial section. We also demonstrate that all such horizons with\n$c_1({\\cal K})=0$ exhibit an SL(2,R) symmetry and preserve either 4 or 8\nsupersymmetries. If the orbits of the SL(2,R) symmetry are 2-dimensional, the\nhorizons are warped products of AdS2 with the horizon spatial section.\nOtherwise, the horizon section admits an isometry which preserves all the\nfields. The proof of these results is centered on the use of index theorem in\nconjunction with an appropriate generalization of the Lichnerowicz theorem for\nhorizons that preserve at least one supersymmetry. In all $c_1({\\cal K})=0$\ncases, we specify the local geometry of spatial horizon sections and\ndemonstrate that the solutions are determined by first order non-linear\nordinary differential equations on some of the fields.\n", "  We study spin Hall effect in a three terminal Y-shaped device in presence of\ntunable spin-orbit (SO) interactions via Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formalism. We\nhave evolved a fabrication technique for creating different angular separation\nbetween the two arms of the Y-shaped device so as to investigate the effect of\nangular width on the spin Hall conductance (SHC). A smaller angular separation\nyields a larger conductance. Also arbitrary orientation of the spin\nquantization axes yields interesting three dimensional contour maps for the SHC\ncorresponding to different angular separation of the Y-shaped device. The\nresults explicitly show breaking of the spin rotational symmetry. Further a\nsystematic study is carried out to compare and contrast between the different\nSO terms, such as Rashba and Dresselhaus SO interactions and the interplay of\nthe angular separation therein.\n", "  A study about the energy and momentum distributions of a new charged regular\nblack hole solution with a nonlinear electrodynamics source is presented. The\nenergy and momentum are calculated using the Einstein and M{\\o}ller\nenergy-momentum complexes. The results show that in both pseudotensorial\nprescriptions the expressions for the energy of the gravitational background\ndepend on the mass $M$ and the charge $q$ of the black hole, an additional\nfactor $\\beta $ coming from the spacetime metric considered, and the radial\ncoordinate $r$, while in both prescriptions all the momenta vanish. Further, it\nis pointed out that in some limiting and particular cases the two complexes\nyield the same expression for the energy distribution as that obtained in the\nrelevant literature for the Schwarzschild black hole solution.\n", "  In this work we investigate the sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy,\nthe octant of the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and the CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$ in\nthe future long-baseline experiments T2HK and DUNE as well as in the\natmospheric neutrino observation at Hyperkamiokande (HK). We show for the first\ntime that the sensitivity is enhanced greatly if we combine these three\nexperiments. Our results show that the hierarchy sensitivity of both T2HK and\nHK are limited due to the presence of parameter degeneracy. But this degeneracy\nis removed when T2HK and HK are added together. With T2HK+HK (DUNE), the\nneutrino mass hierarchy can be determined at least at $ 5 \\sigma$ (8 $\\sigma$)\nC.L. for any value of true $\\delta_{CP}$. With T2HK+HK+DUNE the significance of\nthe mass hierarchy increases to almost 15 $\\sigma$ for the unfavorable value of\n$\\delta_{CP}$. For these combined setup, octant can be resolved except\n$43.5^\\circ < \\theta_{23} < 48^\\circ$ at $5\\sigma$ C.L for both the hierarchies\nirrespective of the value of $\\delta_{CP}$. The significance of CP violation is\naround 10 $\\sigma$ C.L. for $\\delta_{CP} \\sim \\pm 90^\\circ$. Apart from that\nthese combined facility has the capability to discover CP violation for at\nleast $68\\%$ fraction of the true $\\delta_{CP}$ values at $5 \\sigma$ for any\nvalue of true $\\theta_{23}$. We also find that, with combination of all these\nthree, the precision of $\\Delta m^2_{{\\rm eff}}$, $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ becomes 0.3%, 2% and 20% respectively. We also clarify how the\noctant degeneracy occurs in the HK atmospheric neutrino experiment.\n", "  The existence of gravitational radiation is a natural prediction of any\nrelativistic description of the gravitational interaction. In this chapter, we\nfocus on gravitational waves, as predicted by Einstein's general theory of\nrelativity. First, we introduce those mathematical concepts that are necessary\nto properly formulate the physical theory, such as the notions of manifold,\nvector, tensor, metric, connection and curvature. Second, we motivate,\nformulate and then discuss Einstein's equation, which relates the geometry of\nspacetime to its matter content. Gravitational waves are later introduced as\nsolutions of the linearized Einstein equation around flat spacetime. These\nwaves are shown to propagate at the speed of light and to possess two\npolarization states. Gravitational waves can interact with matter, allowing for\ntheir direct detection by means of laser interferometers. Finally, Einstein's\nquadrupole formulas are derived and used to show that nonspherical compact\nobjects moving at relativistic speeds are powerful gravitational wave sources.\n", "  We develop a segment-scale, force-based theory for the breakdown of the\nunentangled Rouse model and subsequent emergence of isotropic mesoscopic\nlocalization and entropic elasticity in chain polymer liquids in the absence of\nergodicity-restoring anisotropic reptation motion. The theory is formulated in\nterms of a conformational N-dynamic-order-parameter Generalized Langevin\nEquation approach. It is implemented using a field-theoretic Gaussian thread\nmodel of polymer structure and closed in a universal manner at the level of the\nchain dynamic second moment matrix. The physical idea is that the isotropic\nRouse model fails due to the dynamical emergence of time-persistent\nintermolecular contacts determined by the combined influence of local chain\nuncrossability, long range polymer connectivity and a self-consistent treatment\nof chain motion and the dynamic forces that hinder it. For long chain melts,\nthe mesoscopic localization length (tube diameter) and emergent elasticity\npredictions are in near quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the\nonset chain length scales with the semi-dilute crossover concentration with a\nrealistic numerical prefactor. Distinctive predictions are made for various\noff-diagonal correlation functions that quantify the full spatial structure of\nthe dynamically localized polymer conformation. As the local uncrossability\nconstraint and/or intrachain bonding spring are softened, the tube diameter is\npredicted to swell until it reaches the chain radius-of-gyration at which point\nentanglement localization vanishes in a discontinuous manner. A full dynamic\nphase diagram for the destruction of mesoscopic localization is constructed,\nwhich is qualitatively consistent with simulations and the classical concept of\nan entanglement degree of polymerization.\n", "  Strong-field quantum-state control is investigated, taking advantage of the\nfull---amplitude and phase---characterization of the interaction between matter\nand intense ultrashort pulses via transient-absorption spectroscopy. A sequence\nof intense delayed pulses is used, whose parameters are tailored to steer the\nsystem into a desired quantum state. We show how to experimentally enable this\noptimization by retrieving all quantum features of the light-matter interaction\nfrom observable spectra. This provides a full characterization of the action of\nstrong fields on the atomic system, including the dependence upon possibly\nunknown pulse properties and atomic structures. Precision and robustness of the\nscheme are tested, in the presence of surrounding atomic levels influencing the\nsystem's dynamics.\n", "  The performance of long-haul coherent optical fiber transmission system is\nsignificantly affected by the equalization enhanced phase noise (EEPN), due to\nthe interaction between the electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) and the\nlaser phase noise. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on different\nchromatic dispersion (CD) compensation and carrier phase recovery (CPR)\napproaches, in the n-level phase shift keying (n-PSK) and the n-level\nquadrature amplitude modulation (n-QAM) coherent optical transmission systems,\nconsidering the impacts of EEPN. Four CD compensation methods are considered:\nthe time-domain equalization (TDE), the frequency-domain equalization (FDE),\nthe least mean square (LMS) adaptive equalization are applied for EDC, and the\ndispersion compensating fiber (DCF) is employed for optical dispersion\ncompensation (ODC). Meanwhile, three carrier phase recovery methods are also\ninvolved: a one-tap normalized least mean square (NLMS) algorithm, a block-wise\naverage (BWA) algorithm, and a Viterbi-Viterbi (VV) algorithm. Numerical\nsimulations have been carried out in a 28-Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature\nphase shift keying (DP-QPSK) coherent transmission system, and the results\nindicate that the origin of EEPN depends on the choice of chromatic dispersion\ncompensation methods, and the effects of EEPN also behave moderately different\nin accordance to different carrier phase recovery scenarios.\n", "  We aim to study the possibility of a hadron-quark phase transition in the\ninterior of neutron stars, taking into account different schematic evolutionary\nstages at finite temperature. We also discuss the strange quark matter\nstability in the quark matter phase. Furthermore, we aim to analyze the\nastrophysical properties of hot and cold hybrid stars, considering the\nconstraint on maximum mass given by the pulsars J1614-2230 and J0348+0432. We\nhave developed a computational code to construct semi-analytical hybrid\nequations of state at fixed entropy per baryon and to obtain different families\nof hybrid stars. An analytical approximation of the Field Correlator Method is\ndeveloped for the quark matter equation of state. For the hadronic equation of\nstate we use a table based on the relativistic mean field theory, without\nhyperons. We solved the relativistic structure equations of hydrostatic\nequilibrium and mass conservation for hybrid star configurations. For the\ndifferent equations of state obtained, we calculated the stability window for\nthe strange quark matter, lepton abundances, temperature profiles and contours\nprofiles for the maximum mass star depending on the parameters of the Field\nCorrelator Method. We also computed the mass-radius and gravitational\nmass-baryonic mass relationships for different hybrid star families. We have\nanalyzed different stages of hot hybrid stars as a first approximation of the\ncooling evolution of neutron stars with quark matter cores. We obtain cold\nhybrid stars with maximum masses $\\geq 2 M_\\odot$ for different combinations of\nthe Field Correlator Method parameters. In addition, our study based on the\ngravitational mass - baryonic mass plane shows a late phase transition between\nhadronic and quark matter during the proto-hybrid star evolution, in contrast\nwith previous studies of proto-neutron stars.\n", "  Fractal metamaterial superconductor geometry has been suggested and analyzed\nbased on the recently developed theoretical description of critical temperature\nincrease in epsilon near zero (ENZ) metamaterial superconductors. Considerable\nenhancement of critical temperature has been predicted in such materials due to\nappearance of large number of additional poles in the inverse dielectric\nresponse function of the fractal. Our results agree with the recent observation\n(Fratini et al. Nature 466, 841 (2010)) that fractal defect structure promotes\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  In this paper we study the Lepton Flavor Violating $Z$ boson decays $Z \\to\n\\tau \\mu$ and $Z \\to \\tau e$ in the context of low scale seesaw models with new\nheavy Majorana neutrinos whose masses could be reachable at the LHC. Our\ncomputations of the decay rates are done in the particular realization given by\nthe Inverse Seesaw Model with six extra heavy neutrinos which are\nquasi-degenerate in three pseudo-Dirac pairs. In particular, we focus on\nscenarios that are built ad-hoc to produce suppressed rates in all the\nprocesses involving $\\mu$-$e$ transitions, given the fact that these are by far\nthe most strongly constrained by present data. We will fully explore the $Z \\to\n\\tau \\mu$ and $Z \\to \\tau e$ rates, together with a set of observables that we\nfind to be the most constraining ones, and we will conclude that sizable rates\nof up to $2 \\times 10^{-7}$, accessible at future colliders, can be reached in\nthis model for Majorana masses in the few TeV range, potentially reachable at\nLHC.\n", "  We describe a general method to determine the location of a point source of\nwaves relative to a two-dimensional active pixel detector. Based on the\ninherent structural sensitivity of crystalline sensor materials, characteristic\ndetector diffraction patterns can be used to triangulate the location of a wave\nemitter. As a practical application of the wide-ranging principle, a digital\nhybrid pixel detector is used to localize a source of electrons for Kikuchi\ndiffraction pattern measurements in the scanning electron microscope. This\nprovides a method to calibrate Kikuchi diffraction patterns for accurate\nmeasurements of microstructural crystal orientations, strains, and phase\ndistributions.\n", "  We review the progress that has been recently made in the application of\ntime-dependent density functional theory to thermoelectric phenomena. As the\nfield is very young, we emphasize open problems and fundamental issues. We\nbegin by introducing the formal structure of \\emph{thermal density functional\ntheory}, a density functional theory with two basic variables -- the density\nand the energy density -- and two conjugate fields -- the ordinary scalar\npotential and Luttinger's thermomechanical potential. The static version of\nthis theory is contrasted with the familiar finite-temperature density\nfunctional theory, in which only the density is a variable. We then proceed to\nconstructing the full time-dependent non equilibrium theory, including the\npractically important Kohn-Sham equations that go with it. The theory is shown\nto recover standard results of the Landauer theory for thermal transport in the\nsteady state, while showing greater flexibility by allowing a description of\nfast thermal response, temperature oscillations and related phenomena. Several\nresults are presented here for the first time, i.e., the proof of invertibility\nof the thermal response function in the linear regime, the full expression of\nthe thermal currents in the presence of Luttinger's thermomechanical potential,\nan explicit prescription for the evaluation of the Kohn-Sham potentials in the\nadiabatic local density approximation, a detailed discussion of the leading\ndissipative corrections to the adiabatic local density approximation and the\nthermal corrections to the resistivity that follow from it.\n", "  Positional single photon incidence response (P-SPIR) theory is researched in\nthis paper to generate more accurate PSF-contained system matrix simply and\nquickly. The method has been proved highly effective to improve the spatial\nresolution by applying to the Eplus-260 primate PET designed by the Institute\nof High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(IHEP).\nSimultaneously, to meet the clinical needs, GPU acceleration is put to use.\nBasically, P-SPIR theory takes both incidence angle and incidence position by\ncrystal subdivision instead of only incidence angle into consideration based on\nGeant4 Application for Emission Tomography (GATE). The simulation conforms to\nthe actual response distribution and can be completed rapidly within less than\n1s. Furthermore,two-block penetration and normalization of the response\nprobability are raised to fit the reality. With PSF obtained, the\nhomogenization model is analyzed to calculate the spread distribution of bins\nwithin a few minutes for system matrix generation. As a reult, The images\nreconstructed indicate that the P-SPIR method can effectively inhibit the depth\nof interaction (DOI) effect especially in the field close to the edge of the\nfield of view (FOV). What is more, the method can be promoted to any other PET\nand the list-mode organization structure high-speedily and efficiently, which\nsubstantially reduces the computing cost and ensures the accuracy of system\nmatrix for PET reconstruction.\n", "  Recent work in the literature has advocated using the Earth-Moon-planetoid\nLagrangian points as observables, in order to test general relativity and\neffective field theories of gravity in the solar system. However, since the\nthree-body problem of classical celestial mechanics is just an approximation of\na much more complicated setting, where all celestial bodies in the solar system\nare subject to their mutual gravitational interactions, while solar radiation\npressure and other sources of nongravitational perturbations also affect the\ndynamics, it is conceptually desirable to improve the current understanding of\nsolar system dynamics in general relativity, as a first step towards a more\naccurate theoretical study of orbital motion in the weak-gravity regime. For\nthis purpose, starting from the Einstein equations in the de Donder-Lanczos\ngauge, this paper arrives first at the Levi-Civita Lagrangian for the geodesic\nmotion of celestial bodies, showing in detail under which conditions the\neffects of internal structure and finite extension get cancelled in general\nrelativity to first post-Newtonian order. The resulting nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations for the motion of planets and satellites are solved for\nthe Earth's orbit about the Sun, written down in detail for the Sun-Earth-Moon\nsystem, and investigated for the case of planar motion of a body immersed in\nthe gravitational field produced by the other bodies (e.g. planets with their\nsatellites). At this stage, we prove an exact property, according to which the\nfourth-order time derivative of the original system leads to a linear system of\nordinary differential equations. This opens an interesting perspective on\nforthcoming research on planetary motions in general relativity within the\nsolar system, although the resulting equations remain a challenge for numerical\nand qualitative studies.\n", "  We demonstrate how supercell implementations of conventional lattice\ndynamical calculations can be used to determine the extent and nature of\ndisorder-induced broadening in the phonon dispersion spectrum of disordered\ncrystalline materials. The approach taken relies on band unfolding, and is\nfirst benchmarked against virtual crystal approximation phonon calculations.\nThe different effects of mass and interaction disorder on the phonon broadening\nare then presented, focussing on the example of a simple cubic binary alloy.\nFor the mass disorder example, the effect of introducing correlated disorder is\nalso explored by varying the fraction of homoatomic and heteroatomic\nneighbours. Systematic progression in the degree of phonon broadening, on the\none hand, and the form of the phonon dispersion curves from primitive to\nface-centered cubic type, on the other hand, is observed as homoatomic\nneighbours are disfavoured. The implications for rationalising selection rule\nviolations in disordered materials and for using inelastic neutron scattering\nmeasurements as a means of characterising disorder are discussed.\n", "  Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the contents of many (membrane-free)\nnuclear \"bodies\" exchange rapidly with the soluble pool whilst the underlying\nstructure persists; such observations await a satisfactory biophysical\nexplanation. To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics\nsimulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent)\nDNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states -- active\n(binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any\nDNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its\naffinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor).\nDue to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into\nclusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange\nwith the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching\nexperiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by\n\"equilibrium\", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state;\nwhen these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow\nindefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of\nchromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of\nhighly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of\nnuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts\nto give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as\nswitching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.\n", "  Interferometers enable ultrasensitive measurement in a wide array of\napplications from gravitational wave searches to force microscopes. The role of\nquantum mechanics in the metrological limits of interferometers has a rich\nhistory, and a large number of techniques to surpass conventional limits have\nbeen proposed. In a typical measurement configuration, the tradeoff between the\nprobe's shot noise (imprecision) and its quantum backaction results in what is\nknown as the standard quantum limit (SQL). In this work we investigate how\nquantum correlations accessed by modifying the readout of the interferometer\ncan access physics beyond the SQL and improve displacement sensitivity.\nSpecifically, we use an optical cavity to probe the motion of a silicon nitride\nmembrane off mechanical resonance, as one would do in a broadband displacement\nor force measurement, and observe sensitivity better than the SQL dictates for\nour quantum efficiency. Our measurement illustrates the core idea behind a\ntechnique known as \\textit{variational readout}, in which the optical readout\nquadrature is changed as a function of frequency to improve broadband\ndisplacement detection. And more generally our result is a salient example of\nhow correlations can aid sensing in the presence of backaction.\n", "  We clarify topology of $^3P_2$ superfluids which are expected to be realized\nin the inner cores of neutron stars and cubic odd-parity superconductors.\n$^3P_2$ phases include uniaxial/biaxial nematic phases and nonunitary\nferromagnetic and cyclic phases. We here show that all the phases are\naccompanied by different types of topologically protected gapless fermions:\nSurface Majorana fermions in nematic phases and a quartet of (single) itinerant\nMajorana fermions in the cyclic (ferromagnetic) phase. Using the superfluid\nFermi liquid theory, we also demonstrate that dihedral-two and -four biaxial\nnematic phases are thermodynamically favored in the weak coupling limit under a\nmagnetic field. It is shown that the tricritical point exists on the phase\nboundary between these two phases and may be realized in the core of realistic\nmagnetars. We unveil the intertwining of symmetry and topology behind mass\nacquisition of surface Majorana fermions in nematic phases.\n", "  We have analyzed images from the VST ATLAS survey to identify candidate\ngravitationally lensed quasar systems in a sample of WISE sources with W1 - W2\n> 0.7. Results from followup spectroscopy with the Baade 6.5 m telescope are\npresented for eight systems. One of these is a quadruply lensed quasar and two\nare doubly lensed systems. Two are projected superpositions of two quasars at\ndifferent redshifts. In one system two quasars, though at the same redshift,\nhave very different emission line profiles, and constitute a physical binary.\nIn two systems the component spectra are consistent with the lensing\nhypothesis, after allowing for micro-lensing. But as no lensing galaxy is\ndetected in these two, we classify them as lensless twins. More extensive\nobservations are needed to establish whether they are in fact lensed quasars or\nphysical binaries.\n", "  We study the quantum entanglement of coupled Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillators using\nthe formalism of thermo-field dynamics. The entanglement entropy is computed\nfor the specific cases of two and a ring of $N$ coupled Pais-Uhlenbeck\noscillators of fourth order. It is shown that the entanglement entropy depends\non the temperatures, frequencies and coupling parameters of the different\ndegrees of freedom corresponding to harmonic oscillators. We also make remarks\non the appearance of instabilities of higher-derivative oscillators in the\ncontext of AdS/CFT correspondence. Finally, we advert to the information\ngeometry theory by calculating the Fisher information metric for the considered\nsystem of coupled oscillators.\n", "  A nano-scale reconfigurable magnonic crystal is designed using\nvoltage-controlled perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in\nferromagnetic-dielectric hetero-structures. A periodic array of gate metallic\nstripes is placed on top of a MgO/Co structure in order to apply a periodic\nelectric field and to modify the PMA in Co. It is numerically demonstrated that\nthe application of the voltage to the gate stripes modifies the spin-wave\npropagation and leads to the formation of band gaps in the spin-wave spectrum.\nThe band gaps are dynamically controllable, i.e. it is possible to switch band\ngaps on and off within a few nanoseconds. The width and the center frequency of\nthe band gaps is defined by the applied voltage. At last, it is shown that the\napplication of the voltage to selected, rather than to all gate stripes allows\nfor a pre-defined modification of the band gap spectra. The proposed\nvoltage-controlled reconfigurable magnonic crystal opens a new way to low power\nconsumption magnonic applications.\n", "  We present a new method to obtain interaction part of a model Hamiltonian\nfrom the result of the first-principles calculation. The effective interaction\ncontained in the model is determined based on the random phase approximation\n(RPA). In contrast to previous methods such as projected RPA or constrained\nRPA, the new method takes into account the long-range part of the polarization\neffect when determining the interaction in the model. After we discuss problems\nin previous RPA methods, we will give the formulation of the new method, and\nshow how it works for the single-band Hubbard model of HgBa$_2$CuO$_4$.\n", "  0.5%, 1%, 3% and 5% Ce-concentration single crystals of Tl2LiLuCl6 were grown\nfrom the melt using two zone vertical Bridgman technique. X-ray induced\nemission spectra showed Ce3+ emission between 370 nm and 540 nm wavelength\nrange. Energy resolution, light yield and decay time of the grown samples were\nmeasured under {\\gamma}-ray excitation at room temperature. Energy resolution\nof 5.6% (FWHM) with 27,000+-2700 light yield is found for 1%Ce doped sample.\nFor the same dopant concentration, three decay time components are also\nobserved. Variation of scintillation properties is observed as a function of\ndopant concentration in this material.This material will provide excellent\ndetection efficiency for X- and {\\gamma}-rays due to its high effective\nZ-number and density. It is expected that this scintillor will be a potential\ndetector for the medical imaging techniques.\n", "  Dirac coupled channel calculations are performed phenomenologically for the\nhigh-lying excited states that belong to the 2$^+$ gamma vibrational band at\nthe 800-MeV polarized proton inelastic scatterings from the s-d shell nuclei,\n$^{24}$Mg and $^{26}$Mg. Optical potential model is used and scalar and\ntime-like vector potentials are considered as direct potentials. First-order\nvibrational collective models are used to obtain the transition optical\npotentials in order to accommodate the high-lying excited vibrational\ncollective states. The complicated Dirac coupled channel equations are solved\nphenomenologically to reproduce the differential cross section and analyzing\npower data by varying the optical potential and deformation parameters.\n  It is found that the relativistic Dirac coupled channel calculation could\ndescribe the high-lying excited states of the 2$^+$ gamma vibrational band at\nthe 800-MeV polarized proton inelastic scatterings from s-d shell nuclei\n$^{24}$Mg and $^{26}$Mg reasonably well, showing better agreement with the\nexperimental data compared to the results obtained from the nonrelativistic\ncalculations. Calculated deformation parameters for the excited states are\nanalyzed and compared with those of nonrelativistic calculations.\n", "  The 232Th(n,{\\gamma})233Th neutron capture reaction cross sections were\nmeasured at average neutron energies of 14.1 MeV and 14.8 MeV using the\nactivation method. The neutron flux was determined using the monitor reaction\n27Al(n,{\\alpha})24Na. The induced gamma-ray activities were measured using a\nlow background gamma ray spectrometer equipped with a high resolution HPGe\ndetector. The experimentally determined cross sections were compared with the\nliteratures data, evaluated data of ENDF/B-VII, JENDL-4.0, and CENDL-3.1. The\nExcitation functions of 232Th(n,{\\gamma}) reaction were also calculated\ntheoretically using the TALYS 1.6 computer code.\n", "  In this paper we explore the stability of an inverted pendulum with\ngeneralized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $N$ sines\nwith different frequencies and phases. We show that when the amplitude is\nscaled with the frequency we obtain the stabilization of the real inverted\npendulum, i.e., with values of $g$ according to planet Earth ($g\\approx\n9.8$m/s$^{2}$) for high frequencies. By randomly sorting the frequencies, we\nobtain a critical amplitude in light of perturbative theory in classical\nmechanics which is numerically tested by exploring its validity regime in many\nalternatives. We also analyse the effects when different values of $N$ as well\nas the pendulum size $l$ are taken into account.\n", "  The generation of rogue waves is investigated via a nonlocal nonlinear\nSchrodinger (NLS) equation. In this system, modulation instability is\nsuppressed and is usually expected that rogue wave formation would also be\nlimited. On the contrary, a parameter regime is identified where the\ninstability is suppressed but nevertheless the number and amplitude of the\nrogue events increase, as compared to the standard NLS (which is a limit of the\nnonlocal system). Furthermore, the nature of these waves is investigated; while\nno analytical solutions are known to model these events, numerically it is\nshown that they differ significantly from either the rational (Peregrine) or\nsoliton solution of the limiting NLS equation. As such, these findings may also\nhelp in rogue wave realization experimentally in these media.\n", "  We consider a vibrating triangular mass-truss lattice whose unit cell\ncontains a resonator of a triangular shape. The resonators are connected to the\ntriangular lattice by trusses. Each resonator is tilted, i.e. it is rotated\nwith respect to the triangular lattice's unit cell through an angle\n$\\vartheta_0$. This geometrical parameter is responsible for the emergence of a\nresonant mode in the Bloch spectrum for elastic waves and strongly affects the\ndispersive properties of the lattice. Additionally, the tilting angle\n$\\vartheta_0$ triggers the opening of a band gap at a Dirac-like point. We\nprovide a physical interpretation of these phenomena and discuss the dynamical\nimplications on elastic Bloch waves. The dispersion properties are used to\ndesign a structured interface containing tilted resonators which exhibit\nnegative refraction and focussing, as in a \"flat elastic lens\".\n", "  We demonstrate a simple and quick method for the measurement of the in-plane\nthermal conductance of thin films via steady-state IR thermography. The films\nare suspended above a hole in an opaque substrate and heated by a homogeneous\nvisible light source. The temperature distribution of the thin films is\ncaptured via infrared microscopy and fitted to the analytical expression\nobtained for the specific hole geometry in order to obtain the in-plane thermal\nconductivity. For thin films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene\nsulfonate post-treated with ethylene glycol and of polyimide we find\nconductivities of 1.0 W/mK and 0.4 W/mK at room temperature, respectively.\nThese results are in very good agreement with literature values, validating the\nmethod developed.\n", "  Micro and nanomechanical resonators with ultra-low dissipation have great\npotential as useful quantum resources. The superfluid micromechanical\nresonators presented here possess several advantageous characteristics:\nstraightforward thermalization, dissipationless flow, and in situ tunability.\nWe identify and quantitatively model the various dissipation mechanisms in two\nresonators, one fabricated from borosilicate glass and one from single crystal\nquartz. As the resonators are cryogenically cooled into the superfluid state,\nthe damping from thermal effects and from the normal fluid component are\nstrongly suppressed. At our lowest temperatures, damping is limited solely by\ninternal dissipation in the substrate materials, and reach quality factors up\nto 913,000 at 13 mK. By lifting this limitation through substrate material\nchoice and resonator design, modelling suggests that the resonators should\nreach quality factors as high as 10$^8$ at 100 mK, putting this architecture in\nan ideal position to harness mechanical quantum effects.\n", "  We propose a theory that describes quantitatively the (in)stability of fully\nMBL systems due to ergodic, i.e. delocalized, grains, that can be for example\ndue to disorder fluctuations. The theory is based on the ETH hypothesis and\nelementary notions of perturbation theory. The main idea is that we assume as\nmuch chaoticity as is consistent with conservation laws. The theory describes\ncorrectly -even without relying on the theory of local integrals of motion\n(LIOM)- the MBL phase in 1 dimension at strong disorder. It yields an explicit\nand quantitative picture of the spatial boundary between localized and ergodic\nsystems. We provide numerical evidence for this picture.\n  When the theory is taken to its extreme logical consequences, it predicts\nthat the MBL phase is destabilised in the long time limit whenever 1)\ninteractions decay slower than exponentially in $d=1$ and 2) always in $d>1$.\nFiner numerics is required to assess these predictions.\n", "  Mogami introduced in 1995 a large class of triangulated 3-dimensional\npseudomanifolds, henceforth called \"Mogami pseudomanifolds\". He proved an\nexponential bound for the size of this class in terms of the number of\ntetrahedra. The question of whether all 3-balls are Mogami has remained open\nsince, a positive answer would imply a much-desired exponential upper bound for\nthe total number of 3-balls (and 3-spheres) with N tetrahedra.\n  Here we provide a negative answer: many 3-balls are not Mogami. On the way to\nthis result, we characterize the Mogami property in terms of nuclei, in the\nsense of Collet-Eckmann-Younan: \"The only three-dimensional Mogami nucleus is\nthe tetrahedron\".\n", "  A tropical curve in $\\mathbb R^{3}$ contributes to Gromov-Witten invariants\nin all genus.\n  Nevertheless, we present a simple formula for how a given tropical curve\ncontributes to Gromov-Witten invariants when we encode these invariants in a\ngenerating function with exponents of $\\lambda$ recording Euler characteristic.\nOur main modification from the known tropical correspondence formula for\nrational curves is as follows: a trivalent vertex, which before contributed a\nfactor of $n$ to the count of zero-genus holomorphic curves, contributes a\nfactor of $2\\sin(n\\lambda/2)$.\n  We explain how to calculate relative Gromov-Witten invariants using this\ntropical correspondence formula, and how to obtain the absolute Gromov-Witten\nand Donaldson-Thomas invariants of some $3$-dimensional toric manifolds\nincluding $\\mathbb CP^{3}$. The tropical correspondence formula counting\nDonaldson-Thomas invariants replaces $n$ by\n$i^{-(1+n)}q^{n/2}+i^{1+n}q^{-n/2}$.\n", "  Using a semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach, we derive\nanalytical expressions for electric and thermoelectric transport coefficients\nof graphene in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. Scattering due to\nacoustic phonons, charged impurities and vacancies are considered in the model.\nSeebeck ($S_{xx}$) and Nernst ($N$) coefficients have been evaluated as\nfunctions of carrier density, temperature, scatterer concentration, magnetic\nfield and induced band gap, and the results are compared with experimental\ndata. $S_{xx}$ is an odd function of Fermi energy while $N$ is an even\nfunction, as observed in experiments. The peaks of both coefficients are found\nto increase with decreasing scatterer concentration and increasing temperature.\nFurthermore, opening a band gap decreases $N$ but increases $S_{xx}$. Applying\na magnetic field introduces an asymmetry in the variation of $S_{xx}$ with\nFermi energy across the Dirac point. The formalism is more accurate and\ncomputationally efficient than the conventional Green's function approach used\nto model transport coefficients and can be used to explore transport properties\nof other exotic materials.\n", "  A new phase for the measurements of radiative decay modes in $b \\to s$\ntransitions has started with new measurements of exclusive modes by LHCb and\nwith Belle-II showing distinctive promises in both inclusive and exclusive\nchannels. After critically reviewing the hadronic uncertainties in exclusive\nradiative decays, we analyze the impact of recent measurements of the branching\nratio and mass-eigenstate rate asymmetry in $B_s\\to\\phi\\gamma$ and of the\nangular distribution of $B\\to K^*e^+e^-$ at low $q^2$ on new physics in the\n$b\\to s\\gamma$ transition.\n", "  In this paper the free energy of the mass deformed ABJM theory on S^3 in the\nlarge N limit is studied. We find a new solution of the large N saddle point\nequation which exists for an arbitrary value of the mass parameter, and compute\nthe free energies for these solutions. We also show that the solution\ncorresponding to an asymptotically AdS_4 geometry is singular at a certain\nvalue of the mass parameter and does not exist over this critical value. It is\nnot clear what the gravity dual of the mass deformed ABJM theory on S^3 for the\nmass parameter larger than the critical value is.\n", "  The investigation of a dilute solution of phantom ideal ring polymers and\nring polymers with excluded volume interactions (EVI) in a good solvent\nconfined in a slit geometry of two parallel repulsive walls and in a solution\nof colloidal particles of big size was performed. Taking into account the\ncorrespondence between the field theoretical $\\phi^4$ $O(n)$-vector model in\nthe limit $n\\to 0$ and the behaviour of long-flexible polymers in a good\nsolvent, the correspondent depletion forces and the forces which exert phantom\nideal ring polymers and ring polymers with EVI on the walls were obtained in\nthe framework of the massive field theory approach at fixed space dimensions\n$d$=3 up to one-loop order. Besides, taking into account the Derjaguin\napproximation, the depletion forces between big colloidal particle and a wall\nand in the case of two big colloidal particles were calculated. The obtained\nresults indicate that phantom ideal ring polymers and ring polymers with EVI\ndue to the complexity of chain topology and for entropical reasons demonstrate\na completely different behaviour in confined geometries compared with linear\npolymers.\n", "  A large number of $(\\alpha,p)$ and $(\\alpha,n)$ reactions are known to play a\nfundamental role in nuclear astrophysics. This work presents a novel technique\nto study these reactions with the active target system MUSIC whose segmented\nanode allows the investigation of a large energy range of the excitation\nfunction with a single beam energy. In order to verify the method, we performed\na direct measurements of the previously measured reactions\n$^{17}$O$(\\alpha,n)^{20}$Ne, $^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,p)^{26}$Mg, and\n$^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,n)^{26}$Al. These reactions were investigated in inverse\nkinematics using $^{4}$He gas in the detector to study the excitation function\nin the range of about 2 to 6 MeV in the center of mass. We found good agreement\nbetween the cross sections of the $^{17}$O$(\\alpha,n)^{20}$Ne reaction measured\nin this work and previous measurements. Furthermore we have successfully\nperformed a simultaneous measurement of the $^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,p)^{26}$Mg and\n$^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,n)^{26}$Al reactions.\n", "  The Fourier-transformed version of the BGK model in one-dimension is solved\nin order to determine the general solution's asymptotics. The ultimate goal of\nthis paper is to demonstrate that the solution to the model Boltzmann possesses\na special property that was conjectured by Truesdell and Muncaster: that\nsolutions decay to a subclass of the solution set uniquely determined by the\ninitial first moment of the gas. First we determine the spectrum and\neigendistributions of the associated homogeneous equation. Then, using Case's\nmethod of elementary solutions, we find analytic time-dependent solutions to\nthe original problem. In doing so, we show that the spectrum separates the\nsolutions into two distinct parts; one that behaves as a set of transient\nsolutions and the other limiting to a stable subclass of solutions. This\ndemonstrates that in time all gas flows for the one-dimensional BGK model\nBoltzmann act as grossly determined solutions.\n", "  Our long term aim is to derive model-independent stellar masses and distances\nfor long period massive binaries by combining apparent astrometric orbit with\ndouble-lined radial velocity amplitudes (SB2). We follow-up ten O+O binaries\nwith AMBER, PIONIER and GRAVITY at the VLTI. Here, we report about 130\nastrometric observations over the last 7 years. We combine this dataset with\ndistance estimates to compute the total mass of the systems. We also compute\npreliminary individual component masses for the five systems with available SB2\nradial velocities. Nine over the ten binaries have their three dimensional\norbit well constrained. Four of them are known colliding wind, non-thermal\nradio emitters, and thus constitute valuable targets for future high angular\nresolution radio imaging. Two binaries break the correlation between period and\neccentricity tentatively observed in previous studies. It suggests either that\nmassive star formation produce a wide range of systems, or that several binary\nformation mechanisms are at play. Finally, we found that the use of existing\nSB2 radial velocity amplitudes can lead to unrealistic masses and distances. If\nnot understood, the biases in radial velocity amplitudes will represent an\nintrinsic limitation for estimating dynamical masses from SB2+interferometry or\nSB2+Gaia. Nevertheless, our results can be combined with future Gaia astrometry\nto measure the dynamical masses and distances of the individual components with\nan accuracy of 5 to 15\\%, completely independently of the radial velocities.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to investigate resonances in quantum graphs with a\ngeneral self-adjoint coupling in the vertices and their trajectories with\nrespect to varying edge lengths. We derive formulae determining the Taylor\nexpansion of the resonance pole position up to the second order which\nrepresent, in particular, a counterpart to the Fermi rule derived recently by\nLee and Zworski for graphs with the standard coupling. Furthermore, we discuss\nthe asymptotic behavior of the resonances in the high-energy regime in the\nsituation where the leads are attached through $\\delta$ or $\\delta_\\mathrm{s}'$\nconditions, and we prove that in the case of $\\delta_\\mathrm{s}'$ coupling the\nresonances approach to the real axis with the increasing real parts as\n$\\mathcal{O}\\big((\\mathrm{Re\\,}k)^{-2}\\big)$.\n", "  We consider a gravitational theory with two Maxwell fields, a dilatonic\nscalar and spatially dependent axions. Black brane solutions to this theory are\nLifshitz-like and violate hyperscaling. Working with electrically charged\nsolutions, we calculate analytically the holographic DC conductivities when\nboth gauge fields are allowed to fluctuate. We discuss some of the subtleties\nassociated with relating the horizon to the boundary data, focusing on the role\nof Lifshitz asymptotics and the presence of multiple gauge fields. The axionic\nscalars lead to momentum dissipation in the dual holographic theory. Finally,\nwe examine the behavior of the DC conductivities as a function of temperature,\nand comment on the cases in which one can obtain a linear resistivity.\n", "  An interesting family gauge boson (FGB) model (Model A) has been proposed by\nSumino. The model can give FGBs with a considerably low energy scale in spite\nof the sever constraints form the observed $K^0$-$\\bar{K}^0$ mixing and so on.\nAn essential idea in Model A is in the so-called Sumino cancellation mechanism\nbetween QED and FGB diagrams. However, Model A is not anomaly free and,\nbesides, it causes effective interactions with $\\Delta N_{\\rm family}=2$. In\norder to avoid these problems, a revised Sumino model with an inverted mass\nhierarchy (Model B) has proposed, but, in this time, it cannot satisfy the\nSumino cancellation mechanism exactly. In this paper, we propose a revised\nversion of Model B, where the model still keeps anomaly free, but it can\nexactly satisfy the Sumino mechanism. An effect of the revised model will be\nconfirmed by observations $K^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ e^- \\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-\nN\\rightarrow e^- N$.\n", "  A fundamental question in quantum transport is how quantum coherence\ninfluences charge transfer through nanostructures. We address this issue for\nlinear triple quantum dots by comparison of a Lindblad density matrix\ndescription with a Pauli rate equation approach and analyze the corresponding\nzero-frequency counting statistics for coherent and sequential charge\ntunneling, respectively. The impact of decaying coherences of the density\nmatrix due to dephasing is also studied. Our findings reveal that the\nsensitivity to coherence shown by shot noise and skewness, in particular in the\nlimit of large coupling to the drain reservoir, can be used to unambiguously\nevidence coherent processes involved in charge transport across triple quantum\ndots. Our analytical results are obtained by using the characteristic\npolynomial approach to full counting statistics.\n", "  Zero-index metamaterials (ZIMs) offer unprecedented ways to manipulate the\nflow of light, and are of interest for wide range of applications including\noptical cloaking, super-coupling, and unconventional phase-matching properties\nin nonlinear optics. Impedance-matched ZIMs can be obtained through a photonic\nDirac-cone (PDC) dispersion induced by an accidental degeneracy of two linear\nbands - typically an electric monopole mode and a transverse magnetic dipole\nmode - at the center of the Brillouin zone. Consequently, PDC can only be\nachieved for a particular combination of geometric parameters of the\nmetamaterial, and hence is sensitive to fabrication imperfections. These\nfabrication imperfections may limit the usefulness in practical applications.\nIn this work we overcome this obstacle and demonstrate robust all-dielectric\n(AD) ZIM that supports PDC dispersion over wide parameter space. Our structure,\nconsisting of an array of Si pillars on silica substrate, is fabricated in\nsilicon-oninsulator (SOI) platform and operates at telecom wavelengths.\n", "  Proton radiography is a technique extensively used to resolve magnetic field\nstructures in high energy density plasmas, revealing a whole variety of\ninteresting phenomena such as magnetic reconnection and collisionless shocks\nfound in astrophysical systems. Existing methods of analyzing proton\nradiographs give mostly qualitative results or specific quantitative parameters\nsuch as magnetic field strength, and recent work showed that the\nline-integrated transverse magnetic field can be reconstructed in specific\nregimes where many simplifying assumptions were needed. Using artificial neural\nnetworks, we suggest a novel 3-D reconstruction method that works for a more\ngeneral case. A proof of concept is presented here, with mean reconstruction\nerrors of less than 5 percent even after introducing noise. We demonstrate that\nover the long term, this approach is more computationally efficient compared to\nother techniques. We also highlight the need for proton tomography because (i)\ncertain field structures cannot be reconstructed from a single radiograph and\n(ii) errors can be further reduced when reconstruction is performed on\nradiographs generated by proton beams fired in different directions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of asymmetric, deformable particles in oscillatory,\nlinear shear flow. By simulating the motion of a dumbbell, a ring polymer, and\na capsule we show that cross-stream migration occurs for asymmetric elastic\nparticles even in linear shear flow if the shear rate varies in time. The\nmigration is generic as it does not depend on the particle dimension.\nImportantly, the migration velocity and migration direction are robust to\nvariations of the initial particle orientation, making our proposed scheme\nsuitable for sorting particles with asymmetric material properties.\n", "  Optical vortices are currently one of the most intensively studied topics in\noptics. These light beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), have\nbeen successfully utilized in the visible and infrared in a wide variety of\napplications. Moving to shorter wavelengths may open up completely new research\ndirections in the areas of optical physics and material characterization. Here,\nwe report on the generation of extreme-ultraviolet optical vortices with\nfemtosecond duration carrying a controllable amount of OAM. From a basic\nphysics viewpoint, our results help to resolve key questions such as the\nconservation of angular momentum in highly-nonlinear light-matter interactions,\nand the disentanglement and independent control of the intrinsic and extrinsic\ncomponents of the photon's angular momentum at short-wavelengths. The methods\ndeveloped here will allow testing some of the recently proposed concepts such\nas OAM-induced dichroism, magnetic switching in organic molecules, and\nviolation of dipolar selection rules in atoms.\n", "  It is natural to investigate if the quantization of an integrable or\nsuperintegrable classical Hamiltonian systems is still integrable or\nsuperintegrable. We study here this problem in the case of natural Hamiltonians\nwith constants of motion quadratic in the momenta. The procedure of\nquantization here considered, transforms the Hamiltonian into the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator plus a scalar potential. In order to transform the\nconstants of motion into symmetry operators of the quantum Hamiltonian,\nadditional scalar potentials, known as quantum corrections, must be introduced,\ndepending on the Riemannian structure of the manifold. We give here a complete\ngeometric characterization of the quantum corrections necessary for the case\nconsidered. St\\\"ackel systems are studied in particular details. Examples in\nconformally and non-conformally flat manifolds are given.\n", "  Perhaps the most intriguing result of Planck's dust-polarization measurements\nis the observation that the power in the E-mode polarization is twice that in\nthe B mode, as opposed to pre-Planck expectations of roughly equal dust powers\nin E and B modes. Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified. We also parametrize models in terms of\nthe power amplitudes and power anisotropies for the three types of waves. We\nfind that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE\ncorrelation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD\nturbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence. We develop a simple phenomenological model, based on\nrandom displacements of the magnetized fluid, that produces EE/BB $\\simeq2$ and\na positive TE cross-correlation. According to this model, the EE/BB and TE\nsignals are due to longitudinal, rather than transverse, modes in the\nrandom-displacement field, providing, perhaps, some clue to the mechanism that\nstirs the ISM. Future investigations involving the spatial dependence of the\nEE/BB ratio, TE correlation, and local departures from statistical isotropy in\ndust-polarization maps, as well as further tests of some of the assumptions in\nthis analysis, are outlined. This work may also aid in the improvement of\nforeground-separation techniques for studies of CMB polarization.\n", "  We present an extension to the general relativistic radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamic code HARMRAD to account for emission and absorption by\nthermal cyclo-synchrotron, double Compton, bremsstrahlung, low-temperature OPAL\nopacities as well as Thomson and Compton scattering. We approximate the\nradiation field as a Bose-Einstein distribution and evolve it using the\nradiation number-energy-momentum conservation equations in order to track\nphoton hardening. We perform various simulations to study how these extensions\naffect the radiative properties of magnetically-arrested disks accreting at\nEddington to super-Eddington rates. We find that double Compton dominates\nbremsstrahlung in the disk within a radius of $r\\sim 15r_g$ (gravitational\nradii) at a hundred times the Eddington accretion rate, and within smaller\nradii at lower accretion rates. Double Compton and cyclo-synchrotron regulate\nradiation and gas temperatures in the corona, while cyclo-synchrotron regulates\ntemperatures in the jet. Interestingly, as the accretion rate drops to\nEddington, an optically thin corona develops whose gas temperature of $T\\sim\n10^9$K is $\\sim 100$ times higher than the disk's black body temperature. Our\nresults show the importance of double Compton and synchrotron in\nsuper-Eddington disks, magnetized coronae, and jets.\n", "  We analyze the morphology of the Magneto-rotational Instability (MRI) for a\nstratified viscous plasma disk configuration in differential rotation, taking\ninto account the so-called corotation theorem for the background profile. In\norder to select the intrinsic Alfv\\'enic nature of MRI, we deal with an\nincompressible plasma and we adopt a formulation of the local perturbation\nanalysis based on the use of the magnetic flux function as a dynamical\nvariable. Our study outlines, as consequence of the corotation condition, a\nmarked asymmetry of the MRI with respect to the equatorial plane, particularly\nevident in a complete damping of the instability over a positive critical\nheight on the equatorial plane. We also emphasize how such a feature is already\npresent (although less pronounced) even in the ideal case, restoring a\ndependence of the MRI on the stratified morphology of the gravitational field.\n", "  In this paper, the problem of the self-adjointness for the case of a quantum\nminisuperspace Hamiltonian retrieved from a Brans-Dicke (BD) action is\ninvestigated. Our matter content is presented in terms of a perfect fluid, onto\nwhich the Schutz's formalism will be applied. We use the von Neumann theorem\nand the similarity with the Laplacian operator in one of the variables to\ndetermine the cases where the Hamiltonian is self-adjoint and if it admits\nself-adjoint extensions. For the latter, we study which extension is physically\nmore suitable.\n", "  We theoretically study the emission statistics of a weakly nonlinear photonic\ndimer during coherent oscillations. We show that the phase and population\ndynamics allow to periodically meet an optimal intensity squeezing condition\nresulting in a strongly nonclassical emission statistics. By considering an\nexciton-polariton Josephson junction resonantly driven by a classical source,\nwe show that a sizeable antibunching should emerge in such semiconductor system\nwhere intrinsic nonclassical signatures have remained elusive to date.\n", "  Stochastic boundary conditions for interactions with a particle reservoir are\ndiscussed in many-particle systems. We introduce the boundary conditions with\nthe injection rate and the momentum distribution of particles coming from a\nparticle reservoir in terms of the pressure and the temperature of the\nreservoir. It is shown that equilibrium ideal gases and hard-disk systems with\nthese boundary conditions reproduce statistical-mechanical properties based on\nthe corresponding grand canonical distributions. We also apply the stochastic\nboundary conditions to a hard-disk model with a steady particle current\nescaping from a particle reservoir in an open tube, and discuss its\nnonequilibrium properties such as a chemical potential dependence of the\ncurrent and deviations from the local equilibrium hypothesis.\n", "  With the aim of understanding compactifications of 6D superconformal field\ntheories to four dimensions, we study punctures for theories of class\n$\\mathcal{S}_{\\Gamma}$. The class $\\mathcal{S}_{\\Gamma}$ theories arise from\nM5-branes probing $\\mathbb{C}^2 / \\Gamma$, an ADE singularity. The resulting 4D\ntheories descend from compactification on Riemann surfaces decorated with\npunctures. We show that for class $\\mathcal{S}_{\\Gamma}$ theories, a puncture\nis specified by singular boundary conditions for fields in the 5D quiver gauge\ntheory obtained from compactification of the 6D theory on a cylinder geometry.\nWe determine general boundary conditions and study in detail solutions with\nfirst order poles. This yields a generalization of the Nahm pole data present\nfor $1/2$ BPS punctures for theories of class $\\mathcal{S}$. Focusing on\nspecific algebraic structures, we show how the standard discussion of nilpotent\norbits and its connection to representations of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ generalizes\nin this broader context.\n", "  In the previous paper, the authors pointed out correspondence between a\nsupersymmetric double-well matrix model and two-dimensional type IIA\nsuperstring theory on a Ramond-Ramond background from the viewpoint of symmetry\nand spectrum. This was confirmed by agreement between planar correlation\nfunctions in the matrix model and tree-level amplitudes in the superstring\ntheory. In order to investigate the correspondence further, in this paper we\ncompute correlation functions to all order of genus expansion in the double\nscaling limit of the matrix model. One-point functions of operators protected\nby supersymmetry terminate at some finite order, whereas those of unprotected\noperators yield non-Borel summable series. The behavior of the latter is\ncharacteristic in string perturbation series, providing further evidence that\nthe matrix model describes a string theory. Moreover, instanton corrections to\nthe planar one-point functions are also computed, and universal logarithmic\nscaling behavior is found for non-supersymmetric operators.\n", "  We demonstrate that spectrally diverse multiple magnetic dipole resonances\ncan be excited in all-dielectric structures lacking rotational symmetry, in\ncontrast to conventionally used spheres, disks or spheroids. Such multiple\nmagnetic resonances arise from hybrid Mie-Fabry-P\\'{e}rot modes, and can\nconstructively interfere with induced electric dipole moments, thereby leading\nto novel multi-frequency unidirectional scattering. Here we focus on elongated\ndielectric nanobars, whose magnetic resonances can be spectrally tuned by their\naspect ratios. Based on our theoretical results, we suggest all-dielectric\nmultimode metasurfaces and verify them in proof-of-principle microwave\nexperiments. We also believe that the demonstrated property of multimode\ndirectionality is largely responsible for the best efficiency of all-dielectric\nmetasurfaces that were recently shown to operate across multiple telecom bands.\n", "  We report on bifurcations effect mediated by the electron-phonon coupling in\na concentrated rare-earth-containing antiferromagnet, observed in the spectra\nof coupled $4f$-electron-phonon modes under the influence of an external\nmagnetic field. The effect was observed in the low-temperature far-infrared\n(terahertz) reflection spectra of a multiferroic easy-axis antiferromagnet\n$PrFe_3(BO_3)_4$ in magnetic fields $\\textbf{B}_{ext}||c$. Both paramagnetic\nand magnetically ordered phases (including a spin-flop one) were studied in\nmagnetic fields up to 30 T. We show that the field behavior of the coupled\nmodes can be successfully explained and modeled on the base of the equation\nderived in the frame of the theory of coupled electron-phonon modes, with the\nsame field-independent electron-phonon interaction constant $|W| = 14.8\ncm^{-1}$.\n", "  We conduct numerical simulations based on a model of blowing snow to reveal\nthe long-term properties and equilibrium state of aeolian particle transport\nfrom $10^{-5} \\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mathrm{m}$ to $10 \\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mathrm{m}$\nabove the flat surface. The numerical results are as follows. (i) Time-series\ndata of particle transport are divided into development, relaxation, and\nequilibrium phases, which are formed by rapid wind response below $10\n\\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mathrm{cm}$ and gradual wind response above $10 \\hspace{0.5\nex} \\mathrm{cm}$. (ii) The particle transport rate at equilibrium is expressed\nas a power function of friction velocity, and the index of 2.35 implies that\nmost particles are transported by saltation. (iii) The friction velocity below\n$100 \\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ remains roughly constant and lower than the\nfluid threshold at equilibrium. (iv) The mean particle speed above $300\n\\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is less than the wind speed, whereas that below\n$300 \\hspace{0.5 ex} \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ exceeds the wind speed because of\ndescending particles. (v) The particle diameter increases with height in the\nsaltation layer, and the relationship is expressed as a power function. Through\ncomparisons with the previously reported random-flight model, we find a crucial\nproblem that empirical splash functions cannot reproduce particle dynamics at a\nrelatively high wind speed.\n", "  Triode reflex geometry vircator operating within 3.0 - 4.2 GHz range with\nefficiency up to 6% is developed and experimentally investigated. Shiftable\nreflectors are shown to enable frequency tuning and output power control.\nRadiation frequency and power are analyzed for different cathode-anode gap\nvalues and varied reflector positions.\n", "  We discuss the role of elastic and inelastic collisions and their interplay\nin the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. We consider a simplified\nsituation of a static plasma, spatially uniform and isotropic in momentum\nspace. We focus on the small momentum region, which equilibrates first, and on\na short time scale. We obtain a simple kinetic equation that allows for an\nanalytic description of the most important regimes. The present analysis\nsuggests that the formation of a Bose condensate, expected when only elastic\ncollisions are present, is strongly hindered by the inelastic, radiative,\nprocesses.\n", "  We explore critical properties of two-dimensional lattices of spins\ninteracting via an anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian and subject to incoherent\nspin flips. We determine the steady-state solution of the master equation for\nthe density matrix via the corner-space renormalization method. We investigate\nthe finite-size scaling and critical exponent of the magnetic linear\nsusceptibility associated to a dissipative ferromagnetic transition. We show\nthat the Von Neumann entropy increases across the critical point, revealing a\nstrongly mixed character of the ferromagnetic phase. Entanglement is witnessed\nby the quantum Fisher information which exhibits a critical behavior at the\ntransition point, showing that quantum correlations play a crucial role in the\ntransition even though the system is in a mixed state.\n", "  We present measurements of the azimuthal orientation {\\theta}(t) and thermal\namplitude {\\delta}(t) of the large-scale circulation (LSC) of turbulent\nrotating convection within an unprecedented large Rossby number range 1<Ro<314.\nResults of {\\theta}(t) reveal persistent rotation of the LSC flow in the\nretrograde direction over the entire Ro range. The rotation speed ratio remains\na constant of 0.13(${\\pm}$0.01) for 10<Ro<70, but starts to increase with\nincreasing Ro when Ro>70. We identify the mechanism through which the mean\nretrograde rotation speed can be enhanced by stochastic cessations in the\npresence of weak Coriolis force, and show that a low-dimensional, stochastic\nmodel provides predictions of the observed large-scale flow dynamics and\ninterprets its retrograde rotation.\n", "  The instantaneous charge state of uranium ions traveling through a fully\nionized hydrogen plasma has been theoretically studied and compared with one of\nthe first energy loss experiments in plasmas, carried out at GSI-Darmstadt by\nHoffmann \\textit{et al.} in the 90's. For this purpose, two different methods\nto estimate the instantaneous charge state of the projectile have been\nemployed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections,\nand (2) equilibrium charge state formulas for plasmas. Also, the equilibrium\ncharge state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross\nsections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium\ncharge state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly\non the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium\nor an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The\ncharge state of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the\ntarget, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our\ncharge state model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an\nenergy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence\non the projectile charge state. The dielectric formalism has been used to\ncalculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to\ndescribe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge\ndistribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the\nequilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical\npredictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the\ninstantaneous charge state and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy\nloss estimation. The results also show that the initial charge state has a\nstrong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions.\n", "  The transport of heat and particles in the relatively collisional edge\nregions of magnetically confined plasmas is a scientifically challenging and\ntechnologically important problem. Understanding and predicting this transport\nrequires the self-consistent evolution of plasma fluctuations, global profiles\nand flows, but the numerical tools capable of doing this in realistic\n(diverted) geometry are only now being developed. Here a 5-field reduced\n2-fluid plasma model for the study of instabilities and turbulence in\nmagnetised plasmas is presented, built on the BOUT++ framework. This cold ion\nmodel allows the evolution of global profiles, electric fields and flows on\ntransport timescales, with flux-driven cross-field transport determined\nself-consistently by electromagnetic turbulence. Developments in the model\nformulation and numerical implementation are described, and simulations are\nperformed in poloidally limited and diverted tokamak configurations.\n", "  We study the left-right asymmetric model based on SU(3)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L\n\\otimes SU(3)_R \\otimes U(1)_X gauge group, which improves the theoretical and\nphenomenological aspects of the known left-right symmetric model. This new\ngauge symmetry yields that the fermion generation number is three, and the\ntree-level flavor-changing neutral currents arise in both gauge and scalar\nsectors. Also, it can provide the observed neutrino masses as well as dark\nmatter automatically. Further, we investigate the mass spectrum of the gauge\nand scalar fields. All the gauge interactions of the fermions and scalars are\nderived. We examine the tree-level contributions of the new neutral vector,\nZ'_R, and new neutral scalar, H_2, to flavor-violating neutral meson mixings,\nsay K-\\bar{K}, B_d-\\bar{B}_d, and B_s-\\bar{B}_s, which strongly constrain the\nnew physics scale as well as the elements of the right-handed quark mixing\nmatrices. The bounds for the new physics scale are in agreement with those\ncoming from the \\rho-parameter as well as the mixing parameters between W, Z\nbosons and new gauge bosons.\n", "  A set of Schwinger-Dyson equations forming constraints for at most three\nresolvent functions are considered for a class of Chern-Simons matter matrix\nmodels with two nodes labelled by a non-vanishing number $n$. The two cases\n$n=2$ and $n= -2$ label respectively the ABJM matrix model, which is the\nhyperbolic lift of the affine $A_1^{(1)}$ quiver matrix model, and the lens\nspace matrix model. In the planar limit, we derive two cubic loop equations for\nthe two planar resolvents. One of these reduces to the quadratic one when $n =\n\\pm 2$.\n", "  3C273, the nearest bright quasar, comprises a strong nuclear core and a\nbright, one-sided jet extending ~ 23 arcseconds to the SW. The source has been\nthe subject of imaging campaigns in all wavebands. Extensive observations of\nthis source have been made with the Very Large Array and other telescopes as\npart of a campaign to understand the jet emission mechanisms. Partial results\nfrom the VLA radio campaign have been published, but to date, the complete set\nof VLA imaging results has not been made available. We have utilized the VLA to\ndetermine the radio structure of 3C273 in Stokes I, Q, and U, over the widest\npossible frequency and resolution range. The VLA observed the source in all\nfour of its configurations, and with all eight of its frequency bands, spanning\n73.8 MHz to 43 GHz. The data were taken in a pseudo-spectral line mode to\nminimize the VLA's correlator errors, and were fully calibrated with subsequent\nself-calibration techniques to maximise image fidelity. Images in Stokes\nparameters I, Q, and U, spanning a resolution range from 6 arcseconds to 88\nmilliarcseconds are presented. Spectral index images, showing the evolution of\nthe jet component are shown. Polarimetry demonstrates the direction of the\nmagnetic fields responsible for the emission, and rotation measure maps show\nthe RM to be very small with no discernible trend along or across the jet. This\npaper presents a small subset of these images to demonstrate the major\ncharacteristics of the source emission. A library of all ~500 images has been\nmade available for open, free access by interested parties.\n", "  In this paper, we use our recently developed theory for the backward-in-time\n(BIT) relative dispersion of inertial particles in turbulence (Bragg \\emph{et\nal.}, Phys. Fluids 28, 013305, 2016) to develop the theoretical model by Pan \\&\nPadoan (J. Fluid Mech. 661 73, 2010) for inertial particle relative velocities\nin isotropic turbulence. We focus on the most difficult regime to model, the\ndissipation range, and find that the modified Pan \\& Padoan model (that uses\nthe BIT dispersion theory) can lead to significantly improved predictions for\nthe relative velocities, when compared with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)\ndata. However, when the particle separation distance, $r$, is less than the\nKolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$, the modified model overpredicts the DNS data.\nWe explain how these overpredictions arise from two assumptions in the BIT\ndispersion theory, that are in general not satisfied when the final separation\nof the BIT dispersing particles is $<\\eta$. We then demonstrate the failure of\nboth the original and modified versions of the Pan \\& Padoan model to predict\nthe correct scale-invariant forms for the inertial particle relative velocity\nstructure functions in the dissipation regime. It is shown how this failure,\nwhich is also present in other models, is associated with our present inability\nto correctly predict not only the quantitative, but also the qualitative\nbehavior of the Radial Distribution Function in the dissipation range when\n$St=\\mathcal{O}(1)$\n", "  We model the phase oscillations of electrons in race-track microtrons by\nmeans of an area preserving map with a fixed point at the origin, which\nrepresents the synchronous trajectory of a reference particle in the beam. We\nstudy the nonlinear stability of the origin in terms of the synchronous phase\n-- the phase of the synchronous particle at the injection. We estimate the size\nand shape of the stability domain around the origin, whose main connected\ncomponent is enclosed by the last rotational invariant curve. We describe the\nevolution of the stability domain as the synchronous phase varies. Besides, we\napproximate some rotational invariant curves by level sets of certain\nHamiltonians. Finally, we clarify the role of the stable and unstable invariant\ncurves of some hyperbolic (fixed or periodic) points.\n", "  The absorption rate of low-energy, or soft, electromagnetic radiation by\nspherically symmetric black holes in arbitrary dimensions is shown to be fixed\nby conservation of energy and large gauge transformations. We interpret this\nresult as the explicit realization of the Hawking-Perry-Strominger Ward\nidentity for large gauge transformations in the background of a non-evaporating\nblack hole. Along the way we rederive and extend previous analytic results\nregarding the absorption rate for the minimal scalar and the photon.\n", "  A graphical representation based on the isothermal current-voltage (IV)\nmeasurements of typical memristive interfaces is presented. This is the\nstarting point to extract relevant microscopic information of the parameters\nthat control the electrical properties of a device based on a particular\nmetal-oxide interface. The convenience of the method is illustrated presenting\nsome examples were the IV characteristics were simulated in order to gain\ninsight on the influence of the fitting parameters.\n", "  The Dalitz decays eta -> e^+e^-g and omega -> pi^0 e^+e^- have been measured\nin the g p -> eta p and g p -> omega p reactions, respectively, with the A2\ntagged-photon facility at the Mainz Microtron, MAMI. The value obtained for the\nslope parameter of the electromagnetic transition form factor of eta,\nLambda^{-2}_eta=(1.97+/-0.11_tot) GeV^{-2}, is in good agreement with previous\nmeasurements of the eta -> e^+e^-g and eta -> mu^+mu^-g decays. The uncertainty\nobtained in the value of Lambda^{-2}_eta is lower than in previous results\nbased on the eta -> e^+e^-g decay. The value obtained for the omega slope\nparameter, Lambda^{-2}_omega_pi^0 = (1.99+/-0.21_tot) GeV^{-2}, is somewhat\nlower than previous measurements based on omega -> pi^0 mu^+mu^-, but the\nresults for the omega transition form factor are in better agreement with\ntheoretical calculations, compared to earlier experiments.\n", "  Asymptotic Safety provides a mechanism for constructing a consistent and\npredictive quantum theory of gravity valid on all length scales. Its key\ningredient is a non-Gaussian fixed point of the gravitational renormalization\ngroup flow which controls the scaling of couplings and correlation functions at\nhigh energy. In this work we use a functional renormalization group equation\nadapted to the ADM-formalism for evaluating the gravitational renormalization\ngroup flow on a cosmological Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. Besides\npossessing the UV-non-Gaussian fixed point characteristic for Asymptotic Safety\nthe setting exhibits a second non-Gaussian fixed point with a positive Newton's\nconstant and real critical exponents. The new fixed point alters the phase\ndiagram in such a way that all renormalization group trajectories connected to\nclassical general relativity are well-defined on all length scales. In\nparticular a positive cosmological constant is dynamically driven to zero in\nthe deep infrared. Moreover, the scaling dimensions associated with the\nuniversality classes emerging within the causal setting exhibit qualitative\nagreement with results found within the $\\epsilon$-expansion around two\ndimensions, Monte Carlo simulations based on Lattice Quantum Gravity, and the\ndiscretized Wheeler-deWitt equation.\n", "  Although Weyl fermions have proven elusive in high-energy physics, their\nexistence as emergent quasiparticles has been predicted in certain crystalline\nsolids in which either inversion or time-reversal symmetry is\nbroken\\cite{WanPRB2011,BurkovPRL2011, WengPRX2015,HuangNatComm2015}. Recently\nthey have been observed in transition metal monopnictides (TMMPs) such as TaAs,\na class of noncentrosymmetric materials that heretofore received only limited\nattention \\cite{XuScience2015, LvPRX2015, YangNatPhys2015}. The question that\narises now is whether these materials will exhibit novel, enhanced, or\ntechnologically applicable electronic properties. The TMMPs are polar metals, a\nrare subset of inversion-breaking crystals that would allow spontaneous\npolarization, were it not screened by conduction electrons\n\\cite{anderson1965symmetry,shi2013ferroelectric,kim2016polar}. Despite the\nabsence of spontaneous polarization, polar metals can exhibit other signatures\nof inversion-symmetry breaking, most notably second-order nonlinear optical\npolarizability, $\\chi^{(2)}$, leading to phenomena such as optical\nrectification and second-harmonic generation (SHG). Here we report measurements\nof SHG that reveal a giant, anisotropic $\\chi^{(2)}$ in the TMMPs TaAs, TaP,\nand NbAs. With the fundamental and second harmonic fields oriented parallel to\nthe polar axis, the value of $\\chi^{(2)}$ is larger by almost one order of\nmagnitude than its value in the archetypal electro-optic materials GaAs\n\\cite{bergfeld2003second} and ZnTe \\cite{wagner1998dispersion}, and in fact\nlarger than reported in any crystal to date.\n", "  Key to biological success, the requisite variety that confronts an adaptive\norganism is the set of detectable, accessible, and controllable states in its\nenvironment. We analyze its role in the thermodynamic functioning of\ninformation ratchets---a form of autonomous Maxwellian Demon capable of\nexploiting fluctuations in an external information reservoir to harvest useful\nwork from a thermal bath. This establishes a quantitative paradigm for\nunderstanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for\ntheir own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful\ncommunication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and\nstoring results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,\nhowever, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without\ntemporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new\ninformation-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these\nrestrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with\nstructured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one\nhand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an\nuncorrelated environment. On the other, and more appropriate to biological\nadaptation, we show that a ratchet must have memory to most effectively\nleverage structure and correlation in its environment. The lesson is that to\noptimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's\nmemory. Finally, we investigate achieving the IPSL bounds on the amount of work\na ratchet can extract from its environment, discovering that finite-state,\noptimal ratchets are unable to reach these bounds. In contrast, we show that\ninfinite-state ratchets can go well beyond these bounds by utilizing their own\ninfinite \"negentropy\". We conclude with an outline of the collective\nthermodynamics of information-ratchet swarms.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal (WSM) features Weyl fermions in its bulk and topological\nsurface states on surfaces, and is novel material hosting Weyl fermions, a kind\nof fundamental particles. The WSM was regarded as a three-dimensional version\nof \"graphene\" under the illusion. In order to explore its promising\nphotoelectric properties and applications in photonics and photoelectronics,\nhere, we study the anisotropic linear and nonlinear optical responses of a WSM\nTaAs, which are determined by the relationship and balance between its\ntopological surface states and Weyl nodes. We demonstrate that topological\nsurface states which break the bulk symmetry are responsible for the anisotropy\nof the mobility, and the anisotropic nonlinear response shows saturable\ncharacteristic with extremely large saturable intensity. We also find that the\nmobility is anisotropic with the magnitude of 104 cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature\nand can be accelerated by the optical field. By analyzing the symmetry, the\nnonlinear response is mainly contributed by the fermions close to the Weyl\nnodes, and is related to the Pauli's blocking of fermions, electron-electron\ninteraction. This work experimentally discovers the anisotropic ultrahigh\nmobility of WSMs in the optical field and may start the field for the\napplications of WSMs in photonics and photoelectronics.\n", "  Parameterizations of the pp scattering data at the LHC collision energies\nindicate a hollow in the inelasticity profile of the pp interaction, with less\nabsorption for head-on collisions than at a non-zero impact parameter. We show\nthat some qualitatively unnoticed features may be unveiled by a judicious\napplication of the inverse scattering problem in the eikonal approximation and\ninterpre- tation within an optical potential model. The hollowness effect is\nmagnifed in a 3D picture of the optical potential, and will presumably be\nenhanced at yet higher energies. Moreover, in 3D it sets in at much smaller\nenergies than at the LHC. We argue that hollowness in the impact parameter is a\nquantum effect, relying on the build-up of the real part of the eikonal\nscattering phase and its possible passage through $\\pi/2$. We also show that it\nprecludes models of inelastic collisions where inelasticity is obtained by\nnaive folding of partonic densities.\n", "  By using the technique of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we study a quasi\nexactly solvable extension of the N-particle rational Calogero model with\nharmonic confining interaction. Such quasi exactly solvable many particle\nsystem, whose effective potential in the radial direction yields a\nsupersymmetric partner of the radial harmonic oscillator, is constructed by\nincluding new long-range interactions to the rational Calogero model. An\ninfinite number of bound state energy levels are obtained for this system under\ncertain conditions. We also calculate the corresponding bound state wave\nfunctions in terms of the recently discovered exceptional orthogonal Laguerre\npolynomials.\n", "  Within the context of a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching,\nwe study the modification of the angular distribution of the energy within jets\nin heavy ion collisions, as partons within jet showers lose energy and get\nkicked as they traverse the strongly coupled plasma produced in the collision.\nTo describe the dynamics transverse to the jet axis, we add the effects of\ntransverse momentum broadening into our hybrid construction, introducing a\nparameter $K\\equiv \\hat q/T^3$ that governs its magnitude. We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of\nthe medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation\nbetween the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle\nwith the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to\nextract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon\nintroducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to\nthe jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes\nfor understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets.\n", "  We study the Anderson transition on a generic model of random graphs with a\ntunable branching parameter $1<K\\le 2$, through large scale numerical\nsimulations and finite-size scaling analysis. We find that a single transition\nseparates a localized phase from an unusual delocalized phase which is ergodic\nat large scales but strongly non-ergodic at smaller scales. In the critical\nregime, multifractal wavefunctions are located on few branches of the graph.\nDifferent scaling laws apply on both sides of the transition: a scaling with\nthe linear size of the system on the localized side, and an unusual volumic\nscaling on the delocalized side. The critical scalings and exponents are\nindependent of the branching parameter, which strongly supports the\nuniversality of our results.\n", "  We define and calculate helicity partial-wave amplitudes for processes\nlinking the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking Sector (EWSBS) to $\\gamma\\gamma$,\nemploying (to NLO) the Higgs-EFT (HEFT) extension of the Standard Model and the\nEquivalence Theorem, while neglecting all particle masses. The resulting\namplitudes can be useful in the energy regime ($500\\,{\\rm GeV}-3\\,{\\rm TeV}$).\nWe also deal with their unitarization so that resonances of the EWSBS can\nsimultaneously be described in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ initial or final states. Our\nresulting amplitudes satisfy unitarity, perturbatively in $\\alpha$, but for all\n$s$ values. In this way we improve on the HEFT that fails as interactions\nbecome stronger with growing $s$ and provide a natural framework for the decay\nof dynamically generated resonances into $WW$, $ZZ$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ pairs.\n", "  In this work we have obtained a higher-derivative Lagrangian for a charged\nfluid coupled with the electromagnetic fluid and the Dirac's constraints\nanalysis was discussed. A set of first-class constraints fixed by noncovariant\ngauge condition was obtained. The path integral formalism was used to obtain\nthe partition function for the corresponding higher-derivative Hamiltonian and\nthe Faddeev-Popov ansatz was used to construct an effective Lagrangian. Through\nthe partition function, a Stefan-Boltzmann type law was obtained.\n", "  Soft gravitons produced by the expansion of de Sitter can be viewed as the\nNambu-Goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries of the de\nSitter spacetime. We explicitly construct the associated charges, and show that\nacting with the charges on the vacuum creates a new state equivalent to a\nchange in the local coordinates induced by the soft graviton. While the effect\nremains unobservable within the domain of a single observer where the symmetry\nis unbroken, this change is physical when comparing different asymptotic\nobservers, or between a transformed and un-transformed initial state,\nconsistent with the scale-dependent statistical anisotropies previously derived\nusing semiclassical relations. We then compute the overlap, $\\langle0|\n0'\\rangle$, between the unperturbed de Sitter vacuum $|0\\rangle$, and the state\n$| 0'\\rangle$ obtained by acting $\\mathcal{N}$ times with the charge. We show\nthat when $\\mathcal{N}\\to M_p^2/H^2$ this overlap receives order one\ncorrections and $\\langle0| 0'\\rangle\\to 0$, which corresponds to an infrared\nperturbative breakdown after a time $t_{dS} \\sim M_p^2/H^3$ has elapsed,\nconsistent with earlier arguments in the literature arguing for a perturbative\nbreakdown on this timescale. We also discuss the generalization to inflation,\nand rederive the 3-point and one-loop consistency relations.\n", "  Preliminary experimental data for nucleon transfer reactions of the 40Ca+58Ni\nand 40Ca+64Ni systems are analyzed with the coupled- channels approach. It is\nshown that a simple treatment for the transfer in the coupled-channels method\ncannot reproduce simultaneously the transfer probabilities and the sub-barrier\nenhancement of fusion cross sections.\n", "  We investigate $p$ $\\overline{\\text{D6}}$ branes inside a flux throat that\ncarries $K \\times M$ D6 charges with $K$ the 3-form flux quantum and $M$ the\nRomans mass. We find that within the calculable supergravity regime where $g_s\np$ is large, the $\\overline{\\text{D6}}$ branes annihilate immediately against\nthe fluxes despite the existence of a metastable state at small $p/M$ in the\nprobe approximation. The crucial property that causes this naive conflict with\neffective field theory is a singularity in the 3-form flux, which we cut off at\nstring scale. Our result explains the absence of regular solutions at finite\ntemperature and suggests there should be a smooth time-dependent solution. We\nalso discuss the qualitative differences between $\\overline{\\text{D6}}$ branes\nand $\\overline{\\text{D3}}$ branes, which makes it a priori not obvious to\nconclude the same instability for $\\overline{\\text{D3}}$ branes.\n", "  The kinetic transport of electrons through graphene magnetic barriers is\nstudied theoretically in presence of an external time harmonic scalar\npotential. The transmission coefficients are calculated in the framework of the\nnon-perturbative Floquet theory using transfer matrix method. The time\ndependent scalar potential is found to suppress the usual Fabry-Perot\noscillations occurring in the transmission through a constant vector potential\nbarrier (corresponding to two oppositely directed delta-function magnetic\nbarriers). Two types of asymmetric Fano resonances (FR) are noted and are\ndiscussed for the narrow barrier structure. One of them arises due to the\noscillatory mode while the other due to the evanescent mode of the electron\nwave inside the barrier. In contrast, the oscillating field favors the\ntransmission for rectangular magnetic barrier structure and also exhibits the\nFR due to the presence of bound state inside the barrier. The characteristic\nFano line shape can be tuned by varying the amplitude of the oscillating\npotential. The detection of such FR offers an efficient tool for the\nidentification of the quasi-bound and evanescent extended states inside the\nbarrier not reported in the literature so far, for the case of graphene\nmagnetic barrier structures.\n", "  An accretion outburst onto a neutron star transient heats the neutron star's\ncrust out of thermal equilibrium with the core. After the outburst the crust\nthermally relaxes toward equilibrium with the neutron star core and the surface\nthermal emission powers the quiescent X-ray light curve. Crust cooling models\npredict that thermal equilibrium of the crust will be established $\\approx 1000\n\\, \\mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Recent observations of the cooling neutron star\ntransient MXB 1659-29, however, suggest that the crust did not reach thermal\nequilibrium with the core on the predicted timescale and continued to cool\nafter $\\approx 2500 \\, \\mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Because the quiescent light\ncurve reveals successively deeper layers of the crust, the observed late time\ncooling of MXB 1659-29 depends on the thermal transport in the inner crust. In\nparticular, the observed late time cooling is consistent with a low thermal\nconductivity layer near the depth predicted for nuclear pasta that maintains a\ntemperature gradient between the neutron star's inner crust and core for\nthousands of days into quiescence. As a result, the temperature near the\ncrust-core boundary remains above the critical temperature for neutron\nsuperfluidity and a layer of normal neutrons forms in the inner crust. We find\nthat the late time cooling of MXB 1659-29 is consistent with heat release from\na normal neutron layer near the crust-core boundary with a long thermal time.\n", "  This paper provides the simulated floating zone (SFZ) method that is an\nefficient simulation technique to obtain thermal equilibrium states, especially\nuseful when domain formation prevents the system from reaching a\nspatially-uniform stable state. In the SFZ method, the system is heated up\nlocally, and the heated region is steadily shifted, similar to the floating\nzone method for growing a single crystal with less lattice defect and impurity\nin experiments. We demonstrate that the SFZ method suppresses domain formation\nand accelerates the optimization of the state, taking an example of a magnetic\nvortex crystal state realized in itinerant magnets. We show that the efficiency\nis maximized when the local heating temperature is tuned to be comparable to\nthe characteristic energy scale of the ordered state.\n", "  The Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole model corresponds to a\nsolution of (2+1)-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant, and by a conformal rescaling its metric can be mapped onto the\nhyperbolic pseudosphere surface (Beltrami trumpet) with negative curvature.\nBeltrami trumpet shaped graphene sheets have been predicted to emit Hawking\nradiation that is experimentally detectable by a scanning tunnelling\nmicroscope. Here, for the first time we present an analytical algorithm that\nallows variational solutions to the Dirac Hamiltonian of graphene\npseudoparticles in BTZ black hole gravitational field by using an approach\nbased on the formalism of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians within a\ndiscrete-basis-set method. We show that our model not only reproduces the exact\nresults for the real part of quasinormal mode frequencies of (2+1)-dimensional\nspinless BTZ black hole, but also provides analytical results for the real part\nof quasinormal modes of spinning BTZ black hole, and also offers some\npredictions for the observable effects with a view to gravity-like phenomena in\na curved graphene sheet.\n", "  The scalar fields of supersymmetric models are coordinates of a geometric\nspace. We propose a formulation of supersymmetry that is covariant with respect\nto reparametrizations of this target space. Employing chiral multiplets as an\nexample, we introduce modified supersymmetry variations and redefined auxiliary\nfields that transform covariantly under reparametrizations. The resulting\naction and transformation laws are manifestly covariant and highlight the\ngeometric structure of the supersymmetric theory. The covariant methods are\ndeveloped first for general theories (not necessarily supersymmetric) whose\nscalar fields are coordinates of a Riemannian target space.\n", "  A normal metal - superconductor hybrid single-electron trap with tunable\nbarrier is utilized as a tool for spectrum analysis at the extremely low signal\nlevels, using only well filtered cryogenic microwave background as a photon\nsource in the frequency range from about 50 to 210 GHz. We probe millimeter\nwave propagation in two superconducting systems: a Josephson junction array\naround its plasma frequency, and a superconducting titanium film in the limit\nwhen the photon energies are larger than the superconducting energy gap. This\nregime is relevant for improving the performance of cryogenic quantum devices\nbut is hard to access with conventional techniques. We show that relatively\nsimple models can be used to describe the essential properties of the studied\ncomponents.\n", "  We consider the computation of the topological string partition function for\n5-brane web diagrams with an O7$^-$-plane. Since upon quantum resolution of the\norientifold plane these diagrams become non-toric web diagrams without the\norientifold we are able to apply the topological vertex to obtain the Nekrasov\npartition function of the corresponding 5d theory. We apply this procedure to\nthe case of 5d $SU(N)$ theories with one hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric\nrepresentation and to the case of 5d pure $USp(2N)$ theories. For these cases\nwe discuss the dictionary between parameters and moduli of the 5d gauge theory\nand lengths of 5-branes in the web diagram and moreover we perform comparison\nof the results obtained via application of the topological vertex and the one\nobtained via localisation techniques, finding in all instances we consider\nperfect agreement.\n", "  According to the flow narrative commonly applied to high-energy nuclear\ncollisions a cylindrical-quadrupole component of 1D azimuth angular\ncorrelations is conventionally denoted by quantity $v_2$ and interpreted to\nrepresent elliptic flow. Jet angular correlations may also contribute to $v_2$\ndata as \"nonflow\" depending on the method used to calculate $v_2$, but 2D\ngraphical methods are available to insure accurate separation. The nonjet (NJ)\nquadrupole has various properties inconsistent with a flow interpretation,\nincluding the observation that NJ quadrupole centrality variation in A-A\ncollisions has no relation to strongly-varying jet modification (\"jet\nquenching\") in those collisions commonly attributed to jet interaction with a\nflowing dense medium. In this presentation I describe isolation of quadrupole\nspectra from pt-differential $v_2(p_t)$ data from the RHIC and LHC. I\ndemonstrate that quadrupole spectra have characteristics very different from\nthe single-particle spectra for most hadrons, that quadrupole spectra indicate\na common boosted hadron source for a small minority of hadrons that \"carry\" the\nNJ quadrupole structure, that the narrow source-boost distribution is\ncharacteristic of an expanding thin cylindrical shell (strongly contradicting\nhydro descriptions), and that in the boost frame a single universal quadrupole\nspectrum (L\\'evy distribution) on transverse mass $m_t$ accurately describes\ndata for several hadron species scaled according to their statistical-model\nabundances. The quadrupole spectrum shape changes very little from RHIC to LHC\nenergies. Taken in combination those characteristics strongly suggest a unique\n{\\em nonflow} (and nonjet) QCD mechanism for the NJ quadrupole conventionally\nrepresented by $v_2$.\n", "  In the theory of extreme values of Gaussian processes, many results are\nexpressed in terms of the Pickands constant $\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}$. This\nconstant depends on the local self-similarity exponent $\\alpha$ of the process,\ni.e. locally it is a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) of Hurst index\n$H=\\alpha/2$. Despite its importance, only two values of the Pickands constant\nare known: ${\\cal H}_1 =1$ and ${\\cal H}_2=1/\\sqrt{\\pi}$. Here, we extend the\nrecent perturbative approach to fBm to include drift terms. This allows us to\ninvestigate the Pickands constant $\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}$ around standard\nBrownian motion ($\\alpha =1$) and to derive the new exact result\n$\\mathcal{H}_{\\alpha}=1 - (\\alpha-1) \\gamma_{\\rm E} + \\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\n\\alpha-1\\right)^{2}$.\n", "  Nanostructured metasurfaces offer unique capabilities for local control of\nthe phase and amplitude of transmitted and reflected optical waves. Based on\nthis potential, a large number of metasurfaces have been proposed in recent\nyears as alternatives to standard optical elements. In most cases, however,\nthese elements suffer from large chromatic aberrations, thus limiting their\nusefulness for multi-wavelength or broadband applications. Here, in order to\nalleviate and correct the chromatic aberrations of individual diffractive\nelements, we introduce dense vertical stacking of independent metasurfaces,\nwhere each layer comprises a different material, and is optimally designed for\na different band within the visible spectrum. Using this approach, we\ndemonstrate the first triply RGB achromatic metalens in the visible range and\nperform color imaging with this lens. We further demonstrate functional beam\nshaping by constructing a self-aligned integrated element for Stimulated\nEmission Depletion (STED) microscopy and a lens that provides anomalous\ndispersive focusing. These demonstrations lead the way to the realization of\nsuperachromatic ultrathin optical elements and multiple functional operations,\nall in in a single nanostructured ultrathin element.\n", "  Many real-world networks exhibit a high degeneracy at few eigenvalues. We\nshow that a simple transformation of the network's adjacency matrix provides an\nunderstanding of the origins of occurrence of high multiplicities in the\nnetworks spectra. We find that the eigenvectors associated with the degenerate\neigenvalues shed light on the structures contributing to the degeneracy. Since\nthese degeneracies are rarely observed in model graphs, we present results for\nvarious cancer networks. This approach gives an opportunity to search for\nstructures contributing to degeneracy which might have an important role in a\nnetwork.\n", "  It is believed that stellar black holes (BHs) can be formed in two different\nways: Either a massive star collapses directly into a BH without a supernova\n(SN) explosion, or an explosion occurs in a proto-neutron star, but the energy\nis too low to completely unbind the stellar envelope, and a large fraction of\nit falls back onto the short-lived neutron star (NS), leading to the delayed\nformation of a BH. Theoretical models set progenitor masses for BH formation by\nimplosion, namely, by complete or almost complete collapse, but observational\nevidences have been elusive. Here are reviewed the observational insights on\nBHs formed by implosion without large natal kicks from: (1) the kinematics in\nthree dimensions of space of five Galactic BH X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs), (2) the\ndiversity of optical and infrared observations of massive stars that collapse\nin the dark, with no luminous SN explosions, possibly leading to the formation\nof BHs, and (3) the sources of gravitational waves produced by mergers of\nstellar BHs so far detected with LIGO. Multiple indications of BH formation\nwithout ejection of a significant amount of matter and with no natal kicks\nobtained from these different areas of observational astrophysics, and the\nrecent observational confirmation of the expected dependence of BH formation on\nmetallicity and redshift, are qualitatively consistent with the high merger\nrates of binary black holes (BBHs) inferred from the first detections with\nLIGO.\n", "  This short note presents a summary of the articles arXiv:1408.5357,\narXiv:1412.5939, arXiv:1603.06796, arXiv:1606.01018, arXiv:1606.08148 that were\ndone in collaboration with N. CRAMPE, M. EVANS, C. FINN, K. MALLICK and M.\nVANICAT. It presents an approach to the matrix ansatz of out-of-equilibrium\nsystems with boundaries, within the framework of integrable systems, and was\npresented at ISQS24 (Prague, 2016).\n", "  The centrality dependence of the charged-particle multiplicity densities\n($dN_{ch}/d\\eta$) and transverse energy densities ($dE_{T}/d\\eta$) are\ninvestigated using the two-component Glauber approach for broad range of\nenergies in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. A comprehensive study shows\nthat the data is well described within the framework of two component model\nwhich includes the contribution of \"soft processes\" and \"hard processes\" for\ndifferent centrality classes and energies. The data at two different energies\nare compared by means of the ratio of $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ (and $dE_{T}/d\\eta$) to\nsee the interplay of energy and $x$-scaling.\n", "  Condensation of objects into stable clusters occurs naturally in equilibrium\nand driven systems. It is commonly held that potential interactions, depletion\nforces, or sensing are the only mechanisms which can create long-lived compact\nstructures. Here we show that persistent motile structures can form\nspontaneously from hydrodynamic interactions alone with no sensing or potential\ninteractions. We study this structure formation in a system of colloidal\nrollers suspended and translating above a floor, using both experiments and\nlarge-scale 3D simulations. In this system, clusters originate from a\npreviously unreported fingering instability, where fingers pinch off from an\nunstable front to form autonomous \"critters\", whose size is selected by the\nheight of the particles above the floor. These critters are a stable state of\nthe system, move much faster than individual particles, and quickly respond to\na changing drive. With speed and direction set by a rotating magnetic field,\nthese active structures offer interesting possibilities for guided transport,\nflow generation, and mixing at the microscale.\n", "  This is a second study of chiral anomaly induced transport within a\nholographic model consisting of anomalous $U(1)_V\\times U(1)_A$ Maxwell theory\nin Schwarzschild-$AdS_5$ spacetime. In the first part, chiral\nmagnetic/separation effects (CME/CSE) are considered in presence of a static\nspatially-inhomogeneous external magnetic field. Gradient corrections to\nCME/CSE are analytically evaluated up to third order in the derivative\nexpansion. Some of the third order gradient corrections lead to an\nanomaly-induced negative $B^2$-correction to the diffusion constant. We also\nfind non-linear in $B$ modifications to the chiral magnetic wave (CMW). In the\nsecond part, we focus on the experimentally interesting case of the axial\nchemical potential being induced dynamically by a constant magnetic and\ntime-dependent electric fields. Constitutive relations for the vector/axial\ncurrents are computed employing two different approximations: (a) derivative\nexpansion (up to third order) but fully nonlinear in the external fields, and\n(b) weak electric field limit but resuming all orders in the derivative\nexpansion. A non-vanishing non-linear axial current (CSE) is found in the first\ncase. Dependence on magnetic field and frequency of linear transport\ncoefficient functions (TCFs) is explored in the second.\n", "  We study the regimes of heating in the periodically driven $O(N)$-model,\nwhich represents a generic model for interacting quantum many-body systems. By\ncomputing the absorbed energy with a non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's function\napproach, we establish three dynamical regimes: at short times a\nsingle-particle dominated regime, at intermediate times a stable Floquet\nprethermal regime in which the system ceases to absorb, and at parametrically\nlate times a thermalizing regime. Our simulations suggest that in the\nthermalizing regime the absorbed energy grows algebraically in time with an the\nexponent that approaches the universal value of $1/2$, and is thus\nsignificantly slower than linear Joule heating. Our results demonstrate the\nparametric stability of prethermal states in a generic many-body system driven\nat frequencies that are comparable to its microscopic scales. This paves the\nway for realizing exotic quantum phases, such as time crystals or interacting\ntopological phases, in the prethermal regime of interacting Floquet systems.\n", "  Light massive string states can appear at D-brane intersections with small\nangles. We compute tri-linear Yukawa couplings of such open-string states to\nmassless ones and to one another. Due to ambiguities in the normalisation of\nthe vertex operators, that involve twist fields, we proceed via factorization\nof appropriate scattering amplitudes. Some peculiar features are observed that\nmay lead to interesting signatures at colliders in the future.\n", "  We study phase ordering dynamics in the three-dimensional nearest-neighbor\nIsing model, following rapid quenches from infinite to zero temperature.\nResults on various aspects, viz., domain growth, persistence, aging and\npattern, have been obtained via the Glauber Monte Carlo simulations of the\nmodel on simple cubic lattice. These are analyzed via state-of-the-art methods,\nincluding the finite-size scaling, and compared with those for quenches to a\ntemperature above the roughening transition. Each of these properties exhibit\nremarkably different behavior at the above mentioned final temperatures. Such a\ntemperature dependence is absent in the two-dimensional case for which there is\nno roughening transition.\n", "  Given a constant skew-symmetric matrix A, it is a difficult open problem\nwhether the associated Lotka-Volterra system is integrable or not. We solve\nthis problem in the special case when A is a Toepliz matrix where all\noff-diagonal entries are plus or minus one. In this case, the associated\nLotka-Volterra system turns out to be a reduction of Liouville integrable\nsystems, whose integrability was shown by Bogoyavlenskij and Itoh. We prove\nthat the reduced systems are also Liouville integrable and that they are also\nnon-commutative integrable by constructing a set of independent first\nintegrals, having the required involutive properties (with respect to the\nPoisson bracket). These first integrals fall into two categories. One set\nconsists of polynomial functions which can be obtained by a matricial\nreformulation of Itoh's combinatorial description. The other set consists of\nrational functions which are obtained through a Poisson map from the first\nintegrals of some recently discovered superintegrable Lotka-Volterra systems.\nThe fact that these polynomial and rational first integrals, combined, have the\nrequired properties for Liouville and non-commutative integrability is quite\nremarkable; the quite technical proof of functional independence of the first\nintegrals is given in detail.\n", "  Using the formalism of nonlinear realizations we construct the component\non-shell action of the N=4,d=3 Born-Infeld theory, which is the action of N=2,\nd=3 vector supermultiplet, fixed by invariance with respect to the additional\nspontaneously broken N=2, d=3 supersymmetry. Our construction shows that\ndealing with the systems with partial breaking of supersymmetry with vector\nfields in the multiplet, it is preferrable to use their formulation in terms of\nfermionic superfields only.\n", "  We propose a definition of vorticity at inverse temperature $\\beta$ for Gibbs\nstates in quantum XY or Heisenberg spin systems on the lattice by testing\n$\\exp[-\\beta H]$ on a complete set of observables (\"one-point functions\").\nImposing a compression of Pauli matrices at the boudary, which stands for the\nclassical environment, we perform some numerical simulations on finite lattices\nin case of XY model, which exhibit usual vortex patterns.\n", "  We advocate the step change in properties of discrete $d$-level quantum\nsystems, between $d=2$ and $d\\geq 3$. Qubit systems, or multipartite systems\ncontaining qubit subsystem, are exceptional in their relative simplicity. One\nfaces a step in complexity in valuating measures of quantum correlations for\nqutrits and then other higher dimensional qudits. There is a growing number of\narguments leading to such conclusion: recently found no-go theorem for\ngeneralization of the Peres-Horodecki's PPT criterion \\cite{sko}, change in\ngeometry of state spaces of qubit and higher degree qudits (the so called\n'generalized Bloch ball' is not a ball anymore), restricted possibilities for\ndiagonalization of correlation matrices for bipartite systems, more difficult\nway for handling the set of relevant families of orthogonal projectors.\n", "  Aggregation of amphiphiles through the action of hydrophobic interactions is\na common feature in soft condensed matter systems and is of particular\nimportance in the context of biophysics as it underlies both the generation of\nfunctional biological machinery as well as the formation of pathological\nmisassembled states of proteins. Here we explore the aggregation behaviour of\namphiphilic polymers using lattice Monte-Carlo calculations and show that the\ndistribution of hydrophobic residues within the polymer sequence determines the\nfacility with which dry/wet interfaces can be created and that such interfaces\ndrive the aggregation process.\n", "  High energy radiations are nowadays cornerstone in scientific, medical and\nindustrial imaging and cancer therapy. However, their detection and dosimetry\nare restricted to systems of modest compactness that are not compatible with\nendoscopy. Here, we report the first experimental imaging and dosimetry of\nX-rays with an ultracompact sensor integrated at the end of a single mode\noptical fiber (125 $\\mu$m full diameter). We realize such a dosimeter by\ncoupling luminescent scintillators to a nano-optical antenna engineered at the\nend of the fiber and by detecting in-fiber outcoupled luminescence with a\nphoton counter. Direct profile and real-time dosimetry of a X-ray focused beam\nreveals a spatial resolution of a few microns together with a sensitivity\nbetter than 10$^3$ X-photons$/$s$/\\mu$m$^2$ at energies of 8-10 keV. Because\nthe nano-optical platform is auto-aligned with respect to the fiber, the\nresulting dosimeter is plug-and-play, flexible, and it is suitable for ultralow\nfootprint endoscopic investigations at higher X-ray energies. Our nano-optical\napproach thus offers the possibility of X-ray profiling and dosimetry in\nultra-confined environments, opening up new avenues in the fields of X-ray\nimaging, real-time control of cancer radiotherapies and Curie therapies,\nmedical and industrial endoscopy, etc. With this study, nano-optical antennas\nmake a first key contribution to the development of X-ray sensing protocols and\narchitectures.\n", "  Conventional superstring perturbation theory based on the world-sheet\napproach gives divergent results for the S-matrix whenever the total center of\nmass energy of the incoming particles exceeds the threshold of production of\nany final state consistent with conservation laws. Two systematic approaches\nhave been suggested for dealing with this difficulty. The first one involves\ndeforming the integration cycles over the moduli space of punctured Riemann\nsurfaces into complexified moduli space. The second one treats the amplitude as\na sum of superstring field theory Feynman diagrams and deforms the integration\ncontours over loop energies of the Feynman diagram into the complex plane. In\nthis paper we establish the equivalence of the two prescriptions to all orders\nin perturbation theory. Since the second approach is known to lead to unitary\namplitudes, this establishes the consistency of the first prescription with\nunitarity.\n", "  We consider the softly broken ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric electrodynamics,\nregularized by higher derivatives. For this theory we demonstrate that the\nrenormalization of the photino mass is determined by integrals of double total\nderivatives in the momentum space in all orders. Consequently, it is possible\nto derive the NSVZ-like exact relation between the photino mass anomalous\ndimension and the anomalous dimension of the matter superfields in the rigid\ntheory by direct summation of supergraphs. It is important that both these\nrenormalization group functions are defined in terms of the bare coupling\nconstant, so that the considered NSVZ-like relation is valid independently of\nthe subtraction scheme in the case of using the higher derivative\nregularization. The factorization of integrals defining the photino mass\nrenormalization into integrals of double total derivatives is verified by an\nexplicit two-loop calculation.\n", "  Even though making artificial micrometric swimmers has been made possible by\nusing various propulsion mechanisms, guiding their motion in the presence of\nthermal fluctuations still remains a great challenge. Such a task is essential\nin biological systems, which present a number of intriguing solutions that are\nrobust against noisy environmental conditions as well as variability in\nindividual genetic makeup. Using synthetic Janus particles driven by an\nelectric field, we present a feedback-based particle guiding method, quite\nanalogous to the \"run-and-tumbling\" behavior of Escherichia coli but with a\ndeterministic steering in the tumbling phase: the particle is set to the \"run\"\nstate when its orientation vector aligns with the target, while the transition\nto the \"steering\" state is triggered when it exceeds a tolerance angle\n{\\alpha}. The active and deterministic reorientation of the particle is\nachieved by a characteristic rotational motion that can be switched on and off\nby modulating the AC frequency of the electric field, first reported in this\nwork. Relying on numerical simulations and analytical results, we show that\nthis feedback algorithm can be optimized by tuning the tolerance angle\n{\\alpha}. The optimal resetting angle depends on signal to noise ratio in the\nsteering state, and it is demonstrated in the experiment. Proposed method is\nsimple and robust for targeting, despite variability in self-propelling speeds\nand angular velocities of individual particles.\n", "  The class of commuting quantum circuits known as IQP (instantaneous quantum\npolynomial-time) has been shown to be hard to simulate classically, assuming\ncertain complexity-theoretic conjectures. Here we study the power of IQP\ncircuits in the presence of physically motivated constraints. First, we show\nthat there is a family of sparse IQP circuits that can be implemented on a\nsquare lattice of n qubits in depth O(sqrt(n) log n), and which is likely hard\nto simulate classically. Next, we show that, if an arbitrarily small constant\namount of noise is applied to each qubit at the end of any IQP circuit whose\noutput probability distribution is sufficiently anticoncentrated, there is a\npolynomial-time classical algorithm that simulates sampling from the resulting\ndistribution, up to constant accuracy in total variation distance. However, we\nshow that purely classical error-correction techniques can be used to design\nIQP circuits which remain hard to simulate classically, even in the presence of\narbitrary amounts of noise of this form. These results demonstrate the\nchallenges faced by experiments designed to demonstrate quantum supremacy over\nclassical computation, and how these challenges can be overcome.\n", "  The confinement of energetic particles (EP) is crucial for an efficient\nheating of tokamak plasmas. Plasma instabilities such as Alfven Eigenmodes (AE)\ncan redistribute the EP population making the plasma heating less effective,\nand leading to additional loads on the walls. The nonlinear dynamics of\ntoroidicity induced AE (TAE) is investigated by means of the global gyrokinetic\nparticle-in-cell code ORB5, within the NEMORB project. The nonperturbative\nnonlinear interplay of TAEs and EP due to the wave-particle nonlinearity is\nstudied. In particular, we focus on the nonlinear modification of the\nfrequency, growth rate and radial structure of the TAE, depending on the\nevolution of the EP distribution in phase space. For the ITPA benchmark case,\nwe find that the frequency increases when the growth rate decreases, and the\nmode shrinks radially. This nonlinear evolution is found to be correctly\nreproduced by means of a quasilinear model, namely a model where the linear\neffects of the nonlinearly modified EP distribution function are retained.\n", "  Making use of a simple approximation for the evolution of the radial\ndistribution function, we calculate the temperature dependence of the heat\ncapacity $C_v$ of Ar at constant density. $C_v$ decreases with temperature\nroughly according to the law $\\sim T^{-1/4}$, slowly approaching the hard\nsphere asymptotic value $C_v=\\frac{3}{2}R$. However, the asymptotic value of\n$C_v$ is not reachable at reasonable temperatures , but stays close to 1.7--1.8\n$R$ over a wide range of temperatures after passing a \" magic \" $2R$ value at\nabout 2000 K. Nevertheless these values has nothing to do with loss of\nvibrational degrees of freedom, but arises as a result of a temperature\nvariation of the collision diameter $\\sigma$. \\end{abstract}\n", "  We demonstrate matterwave interference in a warm vapor of rubidium atoms.\nEstablished approaches to light pulse atom interferometry rely on laser cooling\nto concentrate a large ensemble of atoms into a velocity class resonant with\nthe atom optical light pulse. In our experiment, we show that clear\ninterference signals may be obtained without laser cooling. This effect relies\non the Doppler selectivity of the atom interferometer resonance. This\ninterferometer may be configured to measure accelerations, and we demonstrate\nthat multiple interferometers may be operated simultaneously by addressing\nmultiple velocity classes.\n", "  A feasible method is proposed to generate isolated attosecond terawatt x-ray\nradiation pulses in high-gain free-electron lasers. In the proposed scheme, a\nfrequency chirped laser pulse is employed to generate a gradually-varied\nspacing current enhancement of the electron beam and a series of spatiotemporal\nshifters are applied between the undulator sections to amplify a chosen\nultra-short radiation pulse from self-amplified spontaneous emission.\nThree-dimensional start-to-end simulations have been carried out and the\ncalculation results demonstrated that 0.15 nm x-ray pulses with peak power over\n1TW and duration of several tens of attoseconds could be achieved by using the\nproposed technique.\n", "  Compact gamma cameras with a square-shaped monolithic scintillator crystal\nand an array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are actively being developed\nfor applications in areas such as small animal imaging, cancer diagnostics and\nradiotracer guided surgery. Statistical methods of position reconstruction,\nwhich are potentially superior to the traditional centroid method, require\naccurate knowledge of the spatial response of each photomultiplier. Using both\nMonte Carlo simulations and experimental data obtained with a camera prototype,\nwe show that the spatial response of all photomultipliers (light response\nfunctions) can be parameterized with axially symmetric functions obtained\niteratively from flood field irradiation data. The study was performed with a\ncamera prototype equipped with a 30 x 30 x 2 mm3 LYSO crystal and an 8 x 8\narray of SiPMs for 140 keV gamma rays. The simulations demonstrate that the\nimages, reconstructed with the maximum likelihood method using the response\nobtained with the iterative approach, exhibit only minor distortions: the\naverage difference between the reconstructed and the true positions in X and Y\ndirections does not exceed 0.2 mm in the central area of 22 x 22 mm2 and 0.4 mm\nat the periphery of the camera. A similar level of image distortions is shown\nexperimentally with the camera prototype.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the exact triangles consisting of stable vector\nbundles on one-dimensional complex tori, and give a geometric interpretation of\nthem in terms of the corresponding Fukaya category via the homological mirror\nsymmetry.\n", "  Study of the production of pairs of top quarks in association with a Higgs\nboson is one of the primary goals of the Large Hadron Collider over the next\ndecade, as measurements of this process may help us to understand whether the\nuniquely large mass of the top quark plays a special role in electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. Higgs bosons decay predominantly to \\bbbar, yielding\nsignatures for the signal that are similar to $t\\bar{t}$ + jets with heavy\nflavor. Though particularly challenging to study due to the similar kinematics\nbetween signal and background events, such final states ($t\\bar{t} b \\bar{b}$)\nare an important channel for studying the top quark Yukawa coupling. This paper\npresents a systematic study of machine learning (ML) methods for detecting\n$t\\bar{t}h$ in the $h \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ decay channel. Among the eight ML\nmethods tested, we show that two models, extreme gradient boosted trees and\nneural network models, outperform alternative methods. We further study the\neffectiveness of ML algorithms by investigating the impact of feature set and\ndata size, as well as the structure of the models. While extended feature set\nand larger training sets expectedly lead to improvement of performance, shallow\nmodels deliver comparable or better performance than their deeper counterparts.\nOur study suggests that ensembles of trees and neurons, not necessarily deep,\nwork effectively for the problem of $t\\bar{t}h$ detection.\n", "  Measurements of the resistivity anisotropy can provide crucial information\nabout the electronic structure and scattering processes in anisotropic and\nlow-dimensional materials, but quantitative measurements by conventional means\noften suffer very significant systematic errors. Here we describe a novel\napproach to measuring the resistivity anisotropy of orthorhombic materials,\nusing a single crystal and a single measurement, that is derived from a\n$\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ rotation of the measurement frame relative to the\ncrystallographic axes. In this new basis the transverse resistivity gives a\ndirect measurement of the resistivity anisotropy, which combined with the\nlongitudinal resistivity also gives the in-plane elements of the conventional\nresistivity tensor via a 5-point contact geometry. This is demonstrated through\napplication to the charge-density wave compound ErTe$_3$, and it is concluded\nthat this method presents a significant improvement on existing techniques in\nmany scenarios.\n", "  A self-consistent field theory is introduced and used to investigate the\nthermodynamics and spin dynamics of an $S = 1$ quantum spin system with a\nmagnetic Skyrmion. The temperature dependence of the Skyrmion profile as well\nas the phase diagram are calculated. It is shown that the Skyrmion carries a\nphase transition to the ferromagnetic phase of first order with increasing\ntemperature, while the magnetization of the surrounding ferromagnet undergoes a\nphase transition of second order when changing to the paramagnetic phase.\nFurthermore, the electric field driven annihilation process of the Skyrmion is\ndescribed quantum mechanical by solving the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. The results are compared with the trajectories of the semi-classical\ndescription of the spin expectation values using a differential equation\nsimilar to the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.\n", "  We show that the Markov semigroups generated by a large class of singular\nstochastic PDEs satisfy the strong Feller property. These include for example\nthe KPZ equation and the dynamical $\\Phi^4_3$ model. As a corollary, we prove\nthat the Brownian bridge measure is the unique invariant measure for the KPZ\nequation with periodic boundary conditions.\n", "  Time-periodic driving of a quantum system can enable new dynamical\ntopological phases of matter that could not exist in thermal equilibrium. We\ninvestigate two related classes of dynamical topological phenomena in 2D\nsystems: Floquet symmetry protected topological phases (FSPTs), and Floquet\nenriched topological orders (FETs). By constructing solvable lattice models for\na complete set of 2D bosonic FSPT phases, we show that bosonic FSPTs can be\nunderstood as topological pumps which deposit loops of 1D SPT chains onto the\nboundary during each driving cycle, which protects a non-trivial edge state by\ndynamically tuning the edge to a self-dual point poised between the 1D SPT and\ntrivial phases of the edge. By coupling these FSPT models to dynamical gauge\nfields, we construct solvable models of FET orders in which anyon excitations\nare dynamically transmuted into topologically distinct anyon types during each\ndriving period. These bosonic FSPT and gauged FSPT models are classified by\ngroup cohomology methods. In addition, we also construct examples of \"beyond\ncohomology\" FET orders, which can be viewed as topological pumps of 1D\ntopological chains formed of emergent anyonic quasi-particles.\n", "  We present an approach to Bayesian mean estimation of quantum states using\nhyperspherical parametrization and an experiment-specific likelihood which\nallows utilization of all available data, even when qubits are lost. With this\nmethod, we report the first closed-form Bayesian mean estimate for the ideal\nsingle qubit. Due to computational constraints, we utilize numerical sampling\nto determine the Bayesian mean estimate for a photonic two-qubit experiment in\nwhich our novel analysis reduces burdens associated with experimental\nasymmetries and inefficiencies. This method can be applied to quantum states of\nany dimension and experimental complexity.\n", "  We define SU(2|1) supermultiplets described by chiral superfields having\nnon-zero external spins with respect to SU(2) \\subset SU(2|1) and show that\ntheir splitting into N=2, d=1 multiplets contains the so called \"long\"\nindecomposable N=2, d=1 multiplets (2, 4, 2)_l. We give superfield formulation\nfor this type of N=2 long multiplets and construct their most general\nsuperfield action. A simple example of long N=4, d=1 multiplet is also\nconsidered, both in the superfield and the component formulations.\n", "  Microscopic understanding of low-frequency molecular motions in liquids has\nbeen a longstanding goal in soft-matter science. So far, such low-frequency\nmotions have mostly been accessed indirectly by off-resonant optical pulses. A\nmore direct approach would be to interrogate the dynamic structure of liquids\nwith terahertz (THz) radiation. Here, we provide evidence that resonant\nexcitation with intense THz pulses is capable of driving\nreorientational-librational modes of aprotic polar liquids through coupling to\nthe permanent molecular dipole moments. We observe a hallmark of this enhanced\ncoupling: a transient optical birefringence up to an order of magnitude higher\nthan obtained with optical excitation. Our results open up the path to\napplications such as efficient molecular alignment and systematic study of the\ncoupling of rotational motion to other collective motions in liquids.\n", "  Traditional studies of memristive devices have mainly focused on their\napplications in non-volatile information storage and information processing.\nHere, we demonstrate that the third fundamental component of information\ntechnologies { the transfer of information { can also be employed with\nmemristive devices. For this purpose, we introduce a metastable memristive\ncircuit. Combining metastable memristive circuits into a line, one obtains an\narchitecture capable of transferring a signal edge from one space location to\nanother. We emphasize that the suggested transmission lines employ only\nresistive components. Moreover, their networks (for example, Y-connected lines)\nhave an information processing capability.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the cosmological\nmodel based on phantom scalar field on the ground of qualitative analysis of\nthe system of the cosmological model's differential equations and show that as\nopposed to models with classical scalar field, such models have stable\nasymptotic solutions with constant value of the potential both in infinite past\nand infinite future. We also develop numerical models of the cosmological\nevolution models with phantom scalar field in this paper.\n  {\\bf keywords}: cosmological model, phantom scalar field, quality analysis,\nasymptotic behavior, numerical simulation, numerical gravitation.\\\\ {\\bf PACS}:\n04.20.Cv, 98.80.Cq, 96.50.S 52.27.Ny\n", "  The search for a quasi bound $\\eta$ meson in atomic nuclei is reviewed. This\ntentative state is studied theoretically as well as experimentally.\n", "  In the context of friction we use atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate water confined between graphene sheets over a wide range of\npressures. We find that thermal equilibration of the confined water is hindered\nat high pressures. We demonstrate that, under the right conditions, square ice\ncan form in an asperity, and that it is similar to cubic ice VII and ice X. We\nsimulate sliding of atomically flat graphite on the square ice and find\nextremely low friction due to structural superlubricity. The conditions needed\nfor square ice to form correspond to low sliding speeds, and we suggest that\nthe ice observed in experiments of friction on wet graphite is of this type.\n", "  We investigate experimentally a cascade of temperature-compensated\nunequal-path interferometers that can be used to measure frequency states in a\nhigh-dimensional quantum distribution system. In particular, we demonstrate\nthat commercially-available interferometers have sufficient environmental\nisolation so that they maintain an interference visibility greater than 98.5\\%\nat a wavelength of 1550 nm over extended periods with only moderate passive\ncontrol of the interferometer temperature ($< \\pm0.50 ^{\\circ}$C).\nSpecifically, we characterize two interferometers that have matched delays: one\nwith a free-spectral range of 2.5 GHz, and the other with 1.25 GHz. We find\nthat the relative path of these interferometers drifts less than 3~nm over a\nperiod of one hour during which the temperature fluctuates by $<\\pm$0.10\n$^{\\circ} $C. When we purposely heat the interferometers over a temperature\nrange of 20-50 $^{\\circ}$C, we find that the temperature sensitivity is\ndifferent for each interferometer, likely due to slight manufacturing errors\nduring the temperature compensation procedure. Over this range, we measure a\npath-length shift of 26 $\\pm$ 9 nm/$^{\\circ} $C for the 2.5 GHz interferometer.\nFor the 1.25 GHz interferometer, the path-length shift is nonlinear and is\nlocally equal to zero at a temperature of 37.1 $^{\\circ}$C and is 50 $\\pm$ 17\nnm/$^{\\circ} $C at 22 $^{\\circ}$C. With these devices, we realize a cascade of\n1.25 GHz and 2.5 GHz interferometers to measure four-dimensional classical\nfrequency states created by modulating a stable and continuous-wave laser. We\nobserve a visibility $>99\\%$ over an hour, which is mainly limited by our\nability to precisely generate these states. Overall, our results indicate that\nthese interferometers are well suited for realistic time-frequency quantum\ndistribution protocols.\n", "  We model and compute the average response of truncated Burgers-Hopf dynamics\nto finite perturbations away from the Gibbs equipartition energy spectrum using\na dynamical optimization framework recently conceptualized in a series of\npapers. Non-equilibrium averages are there approximated in terms of geodesic\npaths in probability space that best-fit the Liouvillean dynamics over a family\nof quasi-equilibrium trial densities. By recasting the geodesic principle as an\noptimal control problem, we solve numerically for the non-equilibrium responses\nusing an augmented Lagrangian, non-linear conjugate gradient descent method.\nFor moderate perturbations, we find an excellent agreement between the optimal\npredictions and the direct numerical simulations of the truncated Burgers-Hopf\ndynamics. In this near-equilibrium regime, we argue that the optimal response\ntheory provides an approximate yet predictive counterpart to\nfluctuation-dissipation identities.\n", "  We estimate the radiative corrections of order $\\alpha/\\pi$ to the magnetic\nmoments of the proton and the neutron. The photon-loop diagram of the\nvertex-correction type is evaluated with phenomenological nucleon vector form\nfactors. Infrared-finiteness and gauge-invariance require the inclusion of the\nwave-function renormalization factor from the self-energy diagram. Using recent\nempirical form factor parametrizations the corrections amount to\n$\\delta\\kappa_p= -3.42 \\cdot 10^{-3}$ and $\\delta\\kappa_n= 1.34 \\cdot 10^{-3}$.\nWe study also the effects from photon-loops with internal\n$\\Delta(1232)$-isobars. For two customary versions of the $\\Delta N\\gamma\n$-vertex and spin-3/2 propagator, these radiative corrections have values of\n$\\delta\\kappa_p^{(\\Delta)}= (-0.9,\\, 0.0)\\!\\cdot\\! 10^{-3}$ and\n$\\delta\\kappa_n^{(\\Delta)} = (1.2,\\,-0.8)\\!\\cdot\\! 10^{-3}$, respectively.\n", "  The focus of this Chapter is on describing the prospective sources of the\ngravitational wave universe accessible to present and future observations, from\nkHz, to mHz down to nano-Hz frequencies. The multi-frequency gravitational wave\nuniverse gives a deep view into the cosmos, inaccessible otherwise. It has as\nmain actors core-collapsing massive stars, neutron stars, coalescing compact\nobject binaries of different flavours and stellar origin, coalescing massive\nblack hole binaries, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and possibly the very early\nuniverse itself. Here, we highlight the science aims and describe the\ngravitational wave signals expected from the sources and the information\ngathered in it. We show that the observation of gravitational wave sources will\nplay a transformative role in our understanding of the processes ruling the\nformation and evolution of stars and black holes, galaxy clustering and\nevolution, the nature of the strong forces in neutron star interiors, and the\nmost mysterious interaction of Nature: gravity. The discovery, by the LIGO\nScientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration, of the first source of\ngravitational waves from the cosmos GW150914, and the superb technological\nachievement of the space mission LISA Pathfinder herald the beginning of the\nnew phase of exploration of the universe.\n", "  In order to extend our approach based on SU$*$(4), we were led to (real)\nprojective and (line) Complex geometry. So here we start from quadratic\nComplexe which yield naturally the 'light cone'\n$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}=0$ when being related to (homogeneous)\npoint coordinates $x_{\\alpha}^{2}$ and infinitesimal dynamics by tetrahedral\nComplexe (or line elements). This introduces naturally projective\ntransformations by preserving anharmonic ratios. Referring to old work of\nPl{\\\"u}cker relating quadratic Complexe to optics, we discuss (linear)\nsymplectic symmetry and line coordinates, the main purpose and thread within\nthis paper, however, is the identification and discussion of special relativity\nas direct invariance properties of line/Complex coordinates as well as their\nrelation to 'quantum field theory' by complexification of point coordinates or\nComplexe. This can be established by the Lie mapping which relates\nlines/Complexe to sphere geometry so that SU(2), SU(2)$\\times$U(1),\nSU(2)$\\times$SU(2) and the Dirac spinor description emerge without additional\nassumptions. We give a short outlook in that quadratic Complexe are related to\ndynamics e.g.~power expressions in terms of six-vector products of Complexe,\nand action principles may be applied. (Quadratic) products like\n$F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}$ or $F^{a\\,\\mu\\nu}F^{a}_{\\mu\\nu}$, $1\\leq a\\leq 3$ are\nnatural quadratic Complex expressions ('invariants') which may be extended by\nline constraints $\\lambda k\\cdot\\epsilon=0$ with respect to an 'action\nprinciple' so that we identify 'quantum field theory' with projective or\nline/Complex geometry having applied the Lie mapping.\n", "  In general, the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift of trapped particles in\nstellarators is non-zero due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic\nfield. Stellarators in which the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift vanishes\nare called omnigeneous, and they exhibit neoclassical transport levels\ncomparable to those of axisymmetric tokamaks. However, the effect of deviations\nfrom omnigeneity cannot be neglected in practice. For sufficiently low\ncollision frequencies (below the values that define the $1/\\nu$ regime), the\ncomponents of the drifts tangential to the flux surface become relevant. This\narticle focuses on the study of such collisionality regimes in stellarators\nclose to omnigeneity when the gradient of the non-omnigeneous perturbation is\nsmall. First, it is proven that closeness to omnigeneity is required to\npreserve radial locality in the drift-kinetic equation for collisionalities\nbelow the $1/\\nu$ regime. Then, it is shown that neoclassical transport is\ndetermined by two layers in phase space. One of the layers corresponds to the\n$\\sqrt{\\nu}$ regime and the other to the superbanana-plateau regime. The\nimportance of the superbanana-plateau layer for the calculation of the\ntangential electric field is emphasized, as well as the relevance of the latter\nfor neoclassical transport in the collisionality regimes considered in this\npaper. In particular, the tangential electric field is essential for the\nemergence of a new subregime of superbanana-plateau transport when the radial\nelectric field is small. A formula for the ion energy flux that includes the\n$\\sqrt{\\nu}$ regime and the superbanana-plateau regime is given. The energy\nflux scales with the square of the size of the deviation from omnigeneity.\nFinally, it is explained why below a certain collisionality value the\nformulation presented in this article ceases to be valid.\n", "  We consider two types of strongly disordered one-dimensional Hamiltonian\nsystems coupled to baths (energy or particle reservoirs) at the boundaries:\nstrongly disordered quantum spin chains and disordered classical harmonic\noscillators. These systems are believed to exhibit localization, implying in\nparticular that the conductivity decays exponentially in the chain length $L$.\nWe ask however for the profile of the (very slowly) transported quantity in the\nsteady state. We find that this profile is a step-function, jumping in the\nmiddle of the chain from the value set by the left bath to the value set by the\nright bath. The width of the step grows not faster than $\\sqrt{L}$. This is\nconfirmed by numerics on a disordered quantum spin chain of 9 spins and on much\nlonger chains of harmonic oscillators. In the case of harmonic oscillators, we\nalso observe a drastic breakdown of local equilibrium at the step, resulting in\na chaotic temperature profile.\n", "  Active matter systems operate far from equilibrium due to the continuous\nenergy injection at the scale of constituent particles. At larger scales,\ndescribed by coarse-grained models, the global entropy production rate S\nquantifies the probability ratio of forward and reversed dynamics and hence the\nimportance of irreversibility at such scales: it vanishes whenever the\ncoarse-grained dynamics of the active system reduces to that of an effective\nequilibrium model. We evaluate S for a class of scalar stochastic field\ntheories describing the coarse-grained density of self-propelled particles\nwithout alignment interactions, capturing such key phenomena as\nmotility-induced phase separation. We show how the entropy production can be\ndecomposed locally (in real space) or spectrally (in Fourier space), allowing\ndetailed examination of the spatial structure and correlations that underly\ndepartures from equilibrium. For phase-separated systems, the local entropy\nproduction is concentrated mainly on interfaces with a bulk contribution that\ntends to zero in the weak-noise limit. In homogeneous states, we find a\ngeneralized Harada-Sasa relation that directly expresses the entropy production\nin terms of the wavevector-dependent deviation from the fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation between response functions and correlators. We discuss extensions to\nthe case where the particle density is coupled to a momentum-conserving\nsolvent, and to situations where the particle current, rather than the density,\nshould be chosen as the dynamical field. We expect the new conceptual tools\ndeveloped here to be broadly useful in the context of active matter, allowing\none to distinguish when and where activity plays an essential role in the\ndynamics.\n", "  A nonlinear Langmuir wave in the kinetic regime $k\\lambda_D\\gtrsim0.2$ may\nhave a filamentation instability, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\\lambda_D$\nis the Debye length. The nonlinear stage of that instability develops into the\nfilamentation of Langmuir waves which in turn leads to the saturation of the\nstimulated Raman scattering in laser-plasma interaction experiments. Here we\nstudy the linear stage of the filamentation instability of the particular\nfamily \\cite{RoseRussellPOP2001} of Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes\n\\cite{BernsteinGreeneKruskal1957} that is a bifurcation of the linear Langmuir\nwave. Performing direct $2+2D$ Vlasov-Poisson simulations of collisionless\nplasma we find the growth rates of oblique modes of the electric field as a\nfunction of BGK's amplitude, wavenumber and the angle of the oblique mode's\nwavevector relative to the BGK's wavevector. Simulation results are compared to\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  We study the fundamental limits on the reliable storage of quantum\ninformation in lattices of qubits by deriving tradeoff bounds for approximate\nquantum error correcting codes. We introduce a notion of local approximate\ncorrectability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations\nthereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff\nbounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits\n$k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\\delta$ that quantifies how\nwell the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\\ell$\nthat specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In\na regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\\epsilon$ that is\nexponentially small in $\\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local\ncommuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\\frac{2}{D-1}} \\le O\\bigl(n\n(\\log n)^{\\frac{2D}{D-1}} \\bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of\nEuclidean metric. We also find that the code distance of any local approximate\ncode cannot exceed $O\\bigl(\\ell n^{(D-1)/D}\\bigr)$ if $\\delta \\le O(\\ell\nn^{-1/D})$. As a corollary of our formulation of correctability in terms of\nlogical operator avoidance, we show that the code distance $d$ and the size\n$\\tilde d$ of a minimal region that can support all approximate logical\noperators satisfies $\\tilde d d^{\\frac{1}{D-1}}\\le O\\bigl( n\n\\ell^{\\frac{D}{D-1}} \\bigr)$, where the logical operators are accurate up to\n$O\\bigl( ( n \\delta / d )^{1/2}\\bigr)$ in operator norm. Finally, we prove that\nfor two-dimensional systems if logical operators can be approximated by\noperators supported on constant-width flexible strings, then the dimension of\nthe code space must be bounded. This supports one of the assumptions of\nalgebraic anyon theories, that there exist only finitely many anyon types.\n", "  KATANA - the Krakow Array for Triggering with Amplitude discrimiNAtion - has\nbeen built and used as a trigger and veto detector for the S$\\pi$RIT TPC at\nRIKEN. Its construction allows operating in magnetic field and providing fast\nresponse for ionizing particles, giving the approximate forward multiplicity\nand charge information. Depending on this information, trigger and veto signals\nare generated. The article presents performance of the detector and details of\nits construction. A simple phenomenological parametrization of the number of\nemitted scintillation photons in plastic scintillator is proposed. The effect\nof the light output deterioration in the plastic scintillator due to the\nin-beam irradiation is discussed.\n", "  The properties of current-carrying steady states of strongly correlated\nsystems away from the linear-response regime are of topical interest. In this\narticle, we review the renormalized perturbation theory, or renormalized SPT of\nreference [1] for the Anderson model. We present an extension to higher orders\nand compare the higher-order results with NRG calculations. Finally, we\nelucidate the role of Ward identities in calculating out-of-equilibrium\nproperties and address claims made in the literature.\n", "  For amorphous solids, it has been intensely debated whether the traditional\nview on solids, in terms of the ground state and harmonic low energy\nexcitations on top of it, such as phonons, is still valid. Recent theoretical\ndevelopments of amorphous solids revealed the possibility of unexpectedly\ncomplex free energy landscapes where the simple harmonic picture breaks down.\nHere we demonstrate that standard rheological techniques can be used as\npowerful tools to examine non-trivial consequences of such complex free energy\nlandscapes. By extensive numerical simulations on a hard sphere glass under\nquasi-static shear at finite temperatures, we show that, above the so-called\nGardner transition density, the elasticity breaks down, the stress relaxation\nexhibits slow and aging dynamics, and the apparent shear modulus becomes\nprotocol-dependent. Being designed to be reproducible in laboratories, our\napproach may trigger explorations of the complex free energy landscapes of a\nlarge variety of amorphous materials.\n", "  We re-analyze the physical conditions for Magneto-rotational Instability\n(MRI) within a steady axisymmetric stratified disk of plasma, in order to\naccount for the so-called isorotation theory (the spatial profile of\ndifferential angular velocity depends on the magnetic flux surface). We develop\nthe study of linear stability around an astrophysical background configuration,\nfollowing the original derivation in \\cite{Ba:1995}, but implementing the\nisorotation condition as the orthogonality between the background magnetic\nfield and the angular velocity gradient. We demonstrate that a dependence on\nthe background magnetic field direction is restored in the dispersion relation\nand, hence, the emergence of MRI is also influenced by field orientation.\n", "  We investigate the ability of a quantum measurement device to discriminate\ntwo states or, generically, two hypothesis. In full generality, the measurement\ncan be performed a number $n$ of times, and arbitrary pre-processing of the\nstates and post-processing of the obtained data is allowed. Even if the two\nhypothesis correspond to orthogonal states, perfect discrimination is not\nalways possible. There is thus an intrinsic error associated to the measurement\ndevice, which we aim to quantify, that limits its discrimination power. We\nminimize various error probabilities (averaged or constrained) over all pairs\nof $n$-partite input states. These probabilities, or their exponential rates of\ndecrease in the case of large $n$, give measures of the discrimination power of\nthe device. For the asymptotic rate of the averaged error probability, we\nobtain a Chernoff-type bound, dual to the standard Chernoff bound for which the\nstate pair is fixed and the optimization is over all measurements. The key\npoint in the derivation is that i.i.d. states become optimal in asymptotic\nsettings. Minimum asymptotic rates are also obtained for constrained error\nprobabilities, dual to Stein's Lemma and Hoeffding's bound. We further show\nthat adaptive protocols where the state preparer gets feedback from the\nmeasurer do not improve the asymptotic rates. These rates thus quantify the\nultimate discrimination power of a measurement device.\n", "  Refractive optical elements are widely used in millimeter and sub-millimeter\nastronomical telescopes. High resistivity silicon is an excellent material for\ndielectric lenses given its low loss-tangent, high thermal conductivity and\nhigh index of refraction. The high index of refraction of silicon causes a\nlarge Fresnel reflectance at the vacuum-silicon interface (up to 30%), which\ncan be reduced with an anti-reflection (AR) coating. In this work we report\ntechniques for efficiently AR coating silicon at sub-millimeter wavelengths\nusing Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) and bonding the coated silicon to\nanother silicon optic. Silicon wafers of 100 mm diameter (1 mm thick) were\ncoated and bonded using the Silicon Direct Bonding technique at high\ntemperature (1100 C). No glue is used in this process. Optical tests using a\nFourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) show sub-percent reflections for a\nsingle-layer DRIE AR coating designed for use at 320 microns on a single wafer.\nCryogenic (10 K) measurements of a bonded pair of AR-coated wafers also reached\nsub-percent reflections. A prototype two-layer DRIE AR coating to reduce\nreflections and increase bandwidth is presented and plans for extending this\napproach are discussed.\n", "  We analyze the total and baryonic acceleration profiles of a set of\nwell-resolved galaxies identified in the EAGLE suite of hydrodynamic\nsimulations. Our runs start from the same initial conditions but adopt\ndifferent prescriptions for unresolved stellar and AGN feedback, resulting in\ndiverse populations of galaxies by the present day. Some of them reproduce\nobserved galaxy scaling relations, while others do not. However, regardless of\nthe feedback implementation, all of our galaxies follow closely a simple\nrelationship between the total and baryonic acceleration profiles, consistent\nwith recent observations of rotationally supported galaxies. The relation has\nsmall scatter: different feedback implementations -- which produce different\ngalaxy populations -- mainly shift galaxies along the relation, rather than\nperpendicular to it. Furthermore, galaxies exhibit a characteristic\nacceleration, $g_{\\dagger}$, above which baryons dominate the mass budget, as\nobserved. These observations, consistent with simple modified Newtonian\ndynamics, can be accommodated within the standard cold dark matter paradigm.\n", "  The weak bosons are bound states of fermions. Here the excitations of the\nweak bosons are discussed. Especially we study the decays of these excited\nstates into weak bosons and photons.\n", "  Illumination coherence plays a major role in various imaging systems, from\nmicroscopy, metrology, digital holography, optical coherence tomography, to\nultrasound imaging. Here, we present a systematic study on the effects of\ndegrees of spatiotemporal coherence of an illumination (DSTCI) on imaging\nquality. An optical field with arbitrary DSTCI was decomposed into wavelets\nwith constituent spatiotemporal frequencies, and the effects on image quality\nwere quantitatively investigated. The results show the synergistic effects on\nreduction of speckle noise when DSTCI is decreased. This study presents a\nmethod to systematically control DSTCI, and the result provides an essential\nreference on the effects of DSTCI on imaging quality. We believe that the\npresented methods and results can be implemented in various imaging systems for\ncharacterising and improving imaging quality.\n", "  The multichannel Efimov physics is investigated in ultracold heteronuclear\nadmixtures of K and Rb atoms. We observe a shift in the scattering length where\nthe first atom-dimer resonance appears in the $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb system\nrelative to the position of the previously observed atom-dimer resonance in the\n$^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb system. This shift is well explained by our calculations\nwith a three-body model including the van der Waals interactions, and, more\nimportantly, the multichannel spinor physics. With only minor difference in the\natomic masses of the admixtures, the shift in the atom-dimer resonance\npositions can be cleanly ascribed to the isolated and overlapping Feshbach\nresonances in the $^{40}$K-$^{87}$Rb and $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb systems,\nrespectively. Our study demonstrates the role of the multichannel Feshbach\nphysics in determining Efimov resonances in heteronuclear three-body systems.\n", "  Even if the Higgs field does not affect the evolution of the background\ngeometry, its massive inhomogeneities induce large-scale gauge fields whose\nenergy density depends on the slow-roll parameters, on the effective scalar\nmass and, last but not least, on the dimensionless coupling to the space-time\ncurvature. Since the non-Abelian gauge modes are screened, the non-minimal\ncoupling to gravity predominantly affects the evolution of the hypercharge and\nelectromagnetic fields. While in the case of minimal coupling the obtained\nconstraints are immaterial, as soon as the coupling increases beyond one fourth\nthe produced fields become overcritical. We chart the whole parameter space of\nthis qualitatively new set of bounds. Whenever the limits on the curvature\ncoupling are enforced, the magnetic field may still be partially relevant for\nlarge-scale magnetogenesis and exceed $10^{-20}$ G for the benchmark scale of\nthe protogalactic collapse.\n", "  Heteroepitaxial growth of transition-metal oxide films on the open (111)\nsurface of SrTiO3 results in significant restructuring due to the polar\nmismatch. Monitoring the structural and composition on an atomic scale of\nLaNiO3/SrTiO3 (111) interface as a function of processing conditions has\nenabled the avoidance of the expected polar catastrophe. Using atomically\nresolved transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy as well as Low\nenergy electron diffraction, the structure of the thin film, from interface to\nthe surface, has been studied. In this paper, we show that the proper\nprocessing can lead to a structure that is ordered, coherent with the substrate\nwithout intermediate structural phase. Angle-resolved X-ray photoemission\nspectroscopy shows that the oxygen content of thin films increases with the\nfilm thickness, indicating that the polar mismatch is avoided by the presence\nof oxygen vacancies.\n", "  In this talk we present a possible explanation of the presence of high muon\nmultiplicity events registered recenty by CERN ALICE experiment in its\ndedicated cosmic ray run.\n", "  In this talk we summarize the main results of our recent paper, Phys. Rev.\nC94, 014902, where we explore predictions of the wounded quark model for\nparticle production and the properties of the initial state formed in\nultra-relativistic collisions of atomic nuclei.\n", "  We investigate the origin of ubiquitous low energy kinks found in Angle\nResolved Photoemission (ARPES) experiments in a variety of correlated matter.\nSuch kinks are unexpected from weakly interacting electrons and hence\nidentifying their origin should lead to fundamental insights in strongly\ncorrelated matter. We devise a protocol for extracting the kink momentum and\nenergy from the experimental data which relies solely on the two asymptotic\ntangents of each dispersion curve, away from the feature itself. It is thereby\ninsensitive to the different shapes of the kinks as seen in experiments. The\nbody of available data is then analyzed using this method. We proceed to\ndiscuss two alternate theoretical explanations of the origin of the kinks. Some\ntheoretical proposals invoke local Bosonic excitations (Einstein phonons or\nother modes with spin or charge character), located exactly at the energy of\nobserved kinks, leading to a momentum independent self energy of the electrons.\nA recent alternate is the theory of extremely correlated Fermi liquids (ECFL).\nThis theory predicts kinks in the dispersion arising from a momentum dependent\nself energy of correlated electrons. We present the essential results from both\nclasses of theories, and identify experimental features that can help\ndistinguish between the two mechanisms. The ECFL theory is found to be\nconsistent with currently available data on kinks in the nodal direction of\ncuprate superconductors, but conclusive tests require higher resolution energy\ndistribution curve data.\n", "  Acquiring information about an unknown qubit in a superposition of two states\nis essential in any computation process. Quantum measurement, or sharp\nmeasurement, is usually used to read the information contents of that unknown\nqubit system. Quantum measurement is an irreversible operation that makes the\nsuperposition collapses to one of the two possible states in a probabilistic\nway. In this paper, a quantum algorithm will be proposed to read the\ninformation in an unknown qubit without applying sharp measurement on that\nqubit. The proposed algorithm will use a quantum feedback control scheme by\napplying sharp measurement iteratively on an auxiliary qubit weakly entangled\nwith the unknown qubit. The information contents of the unknown qubit can be\nread by counting the outcomes from the sharp measurement on the auxiliary\nqubit. Iterative measurements on the auxiliary qubit will make the amplitudes\nof the superposition move in a random walk manner where a weak measurement is\napplied on the unknown qubit which can be reversed when the random walk takes\nopposite steps to decrease the disturbance introduced to the system. The\nproposed algorithm will define the strength of the weak measurement so that it\ncan be controlled by adding an arbitrary number of dummy qubits $\\mu$ to the\nsystem. This will make the measurement process slowdown to an arbitrary scale\nso that the effect of the sharp measurement on the unknown qubit is reached\nafter $O(\\mu^2)$ measurements on the auxiliary qubit.\n", "  In this paper, we have presented the Noether symmetries of flat FRW spacetime\nin the context of a new action in Teleparallel Gravity which we construct it\nbased on $f(R)$ version. This modified action contains a coupling between\nscalar field potential and magnetism. Also, we introduce an innovative approach\n(B.N.S. Approach) for exact solutions which carry more conserved currents than\nNoether approach. By data analysis of the exact solutions, obtained from\nNoether approach, late time acceleration and phase crossing are realized, and\nsome deep connections with observational data such as the age of the universe,\nthe present amounts of the scale factor as well as the state and deceleration\nparameters are observed. In B.N.S. approach, we have considered dark energy\ndominated era.\n", "  Percolation threshold of a network is the critical value such that when nodes\nor edges are randomly selected with probability below the value, the network is\nfragmented but when the probability is above the value, a giant component\nconnecting large portion of the network would emerge. Assessing the percolation\nthreshold of networks has wide applications in network reliability, information\nspread, epidemic control, etc. The theoretical approach so far to assess the\npercolation threshold is mainly based on spectral radius of adjacency matrix or\nnon-backtracking matrix, which is limited to dense graphs or locally treelike\ngraphs, and is less effective for sparse networks with non-negligible amount of\ntriangles and loops. In this paper, we study high-order non-backtracking\nmatrices and their application to assessing percolation threshold. We first\ndefine high-order non-backtracking matrices and study the properties of their\nspectral radii. Then we focus on 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix and\ndemonstrate analytically that the reciprocal of its spectral radius gives a\ntighter lower bound than those of adjacency and standard non-backtracking\nmatrices. We further build a smaller size matrix with the same largest\neigenvalue as the 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix to improve computation\nefficiency. Finally, we use both synthetic networks and 42 real networks to\nillustrate that the use of 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix does give better\nlower bound for assessing percolation threshold than adjacency and standard\nnon-backtracking matrices.\n", "  A number of electronic devices involve metal/oxide interfaces in their\nstructure where the oxide layer plays the role of electrical insulator. As the\ndownscaling of devices continues, the oxide thickness can spread over only a\nfew atomic layers, making the role of interfaces prominent on its insulating\nproperties. The prototypical Al/SiO2 metal/oxide interface is investigated\nusing first principle calculations, and the effect of the interfacial atomic\nbonding is evidenced. It is shown that the interface bonding configuration\ncritically dictates the mechanical and electronic properties of the interface.\nOxygen atoms are found to better delimit the oxide boundaries than cations.\nInterfacial cation-metal bonds allow the metal potential to leak inside the\noxide layer, without atomic diffusion, leading to a virtual oxide thinning.\n", "  A constraint of vanishing energy-momentum tensor is motivated by a variety of\nperspectives on quantum gravity. We demonstrate in a concrete example how this\nconstraint leads to a metric-independent theory in which quantum gravity\nemerges as a nonperturbative artifact of regularization-scale physics. We\nanalyze a scalar theory similar to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory with\nvanishing gauge fields, with the DBI Lagrangian modulated by a scalar\npotential. In the limit of a large number of scalars, we explicitly demonstrate\nthe existence of a composite massless spin-2 graviton in the spectrum that\ncouples to matter as in Einstein gravity. We comment on the cosmological\nconstant problem and the generalization to theories with fermions and gauge\nfields.\n", "  In this work we give, for the first time, the full relativistic Lagrangian\ndensity describing the motion of induced electric dipoles in the electric\nfields which induce the dipole, and the magnetic fields which generate the HMW\ntopological phase. We then use this relativistic Lagrangian density to derive\nthe complete set of conditions for producing topological phases with induced\ndipoles. We also give the relativistic Lagrangian density describing the motion\nof induced magnetic dipoles in the magnetic fields which induce the dipole, and\nthe electric fields which generate the AC topological phase, and derive the\nconditions for this AC phase to be topological. These conditions have been\nincompletely discussed in previous studies. We note that, in both the AC and\nHMW cases, the topological phases are generated by the cross product of\nelectric and magnetic fields in the form $\\bm{B} \\times \\bm{E}$ which\nreinforces the dual nature of these two topological phases.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of longitudinal particle drifting in a\nstanding circularly polarized wave at extreme intensities when quantum\nradiation reaction (RR) effects should be accounted for. To get an insight into\nthe physics of this phenomenon we made a comparative study considering the RR\nforce in the Landau-Lifshitz or quantum-corrected form, including the case of\nphoton emission stochasticity. It is shown that the cases of circular and\nlinear polarization are qualitatively different. Moreover, specific features of\nparticle dynamics have a strong impact on spatial structures of the\nelectron-positron ($e^-e^+$) density created in vacuum through quantum\nelectrodynamic (QED) cascades in counter-propagating laser pulses. 3D PIC\nmodeling accounting for QED effects confirms realization of different pair\nplasma structures.\n", "  It is a brief account of the harmonic superspace formulations of {\\cal\nN}=(1,0) and {\\cal N}=(1,1) SYM theories in six dimensions. The on-shell {\\cal\nN}=(1,1) harmonic superspace is argued to provide an efficient tool of\nconstructing candidate counterterms and other invariants of {\\cal N}=(1,1) SYM.\nIt allows one, e.g., to find out an essential difference between the single-\nand double-trace dimension d=10 invariants, which could be capable to explain\nthe absence of the three-loop double-trace (non-planar) counterterms in this\ntheory. The defining superspace constraints of {\\cal N}=(1,1) SYM are solved in\nterms of {\\cal N}=(1,0) harmonic superfields.\n", "  It is simply anticipated that in a strong magnetic configuration, the Landau\nquantization ceases the neutral rho meson to decay to the charged pion pair, so\nthe neutral rho meson will be long-lived. To closely access this naive\nobservation, we explicitly compute the charged pion-loop in the magnetic field\nat the one-loop level, to evaluate the magnetic dependence of the lifetime for\nthe neutral rho meson as well as its mass.Due to the dimensional reduction\ninduced by the magnetic field (violation of the Lorentz invariance), the\npolarization (spin $s_z=-1,0,+1$) modes of the rho meson, as well as the\ncorresponding pole mass and width, are decomposed in a nontrivial manner\ncompared to the vacuum case. To see the significance of the reduction effect,\nwe simply take the lowest-Landau level approximation to analyze the\nspin-dependent rho masses and widths. We find that the \"fate\" of the rho meson\nmay be more complicated because of the magnetic-dimensional reduction: as the\nmagnetic field increases, the rho width for the spin $s_z=0$ starts to develop,\nreach a peak, to be vanishing at the critical magnetic field to which the\nfolklore refers. On the other side, the decay rates of the other rhos for\n$s_z=-1,+1$ monotonically increase as the magnetic field develops. The\ncorrelation between the polarization dependence and the Landau-level truncation\nis also addressed.\n", "  Measurements of neutrino mass in cosmological observations rely on two point\nstatistics that are hindered by significant degeneracies with the optical depth\nand galaxy bias. The relative velocity effect between cold dark matter and\nneutrinos induces a large scale dipole into the matter density field and may be\nable to provide orthogonal constraints to standard techniques. We numerically\ninvestigate this dipole in the TianNu Simulation, which contains cold dark\nmatter and 50 meV neutrinos. We first compute the dipole using a new linear\nresponse technique where we treat the displacement caused by the relative\nvelocity as a phase in Fourier space and then integrate the matter power\nspectrum over redshift. Then, we compute the dipole numerically in real space\nusing the simulation density and velocity fields. We find excellent agreement\nbetween the linear response and N-body methods. Utilizing the dipole as an\nobservational tool will require two tracers of the matter distribution that are\ndifferently biased with respect to the neutrino density.\n", "  Several charge integrating CMOS pixel front-ends utilizing charge removal\ntechniques have been fabricated to extend dynamic range for x-ray diffraction\napplications at synchrotron sources and x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). The\npixels described herein build on the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD)\nframework, developed previously by our group to perform high dynamic range\nimaging. These new pixels boast several orders of magnitude improvement in\nmaximum flux over the MM-PAD, which is capable of measuring a sustained flux in\nexcess of 10$^{8}$ x-rays/pixel/second while maintaining sensitivity to smaller\nsignals, down to single x-rays. To extend dynamic range, charge is removed from\nthe integration node of the front-end amplifier without interrupting\nintegration. The number of times this process occurs is recorded by a digital\ncounter in the pixel. The parameter limiting full well is thereby shifted from\nthe size of an integration capacitor to the depth of a digital counter. The\nresult is similar to that achieved by counting pixel array detectors, but the\nintegrators presented here are designed to tolerate a sustained flux >10$^{11}$\nx-rays/pixel/second. Pixel front-end linearity was evaluated by direct current\ninjection and results are presented. A small-scale readout ASIC utilizing these\npixel architectures has been fabricated and the use of these architectures to\nincrease single x-ray pulse dynamic range at XFELs is discussed briefly.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamics of the Potts-Bethe mapping associated\nwith the $p-$adic $q-$state Potts model over the Cayley tree of order three.\nNamely, we establish the regularity of the Potts-Bethe mapping for the case\n$p\\equiv 2 \\ (mod \\ 3)$ with $p\\geq5$.\n", "  We propose a novel method to search for possible new macro-scale spin- and/or\nvelocity-dependent forces (SVDFs) based on specially designed SmCo$_5$ spin\nsources and a spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) comagnetometer. A simulation\nshows that, by covering a SmCo$_5$ permanent magnet with a layer of pure iron,\na high net spin density source of about $1\\times 10^{22}$/cm$^3$ could be\nobtained. Taking advantages of the high spin density of this iron-shielded\nSmCo$_5$ and the high sensitivity of the SERF, the proposed method could set up\nnew limits of greater than 10 orders of magnitude more sensitive than those\nfrom previous experiments or proposals in exploring SVDFs in force ranges\nlarger than 1 cm.\n", "  We consider the problem of large wave prediction in two-dimensional water\nwaves. Such waves form due to the synergistic effect of dispersive mixing of\nsmaller wave groups and the action of localized nonlinear wave interactions\nthat leads to focusing. Instead of a direct simulation approach, we rely on the\ndecomposition of the wave field into a discrete set of localized wave groups\nwith optimal length scales and amplitudes. Due to the short-term character of\nthe prediction, these wave groups do not interact and therefore their dynamics\ncan be characterized individually. Using direct numerical simulations of the\ngoverning envelope equations we precompute the expected maximum elevation for\neach of those wave groups. The combination of the wave field decomposition\nalgorithm, which provides information about the statistics of the system, and\nthe precomputed map for the expected wave group elevation, which encodes\ndynamical information, allows (i) for understanding of how the probability of\noccurrence of rogue waves changes as the spectrum parameters vary, (ii) the\ncomputation of a critical length scale characterizing wave groups with high\nprobability of evolving to rogue waves, and (iii) the formulation of a robust\nand parsimonious reduced-order prediction scheme for large waves. We assess the\nvalidity of this scheme in several cases of ocean wave spectra.\n", "  In this talk we review some of our results for the longitudinal correlations\nin connection with recent experimental data, in particular for the {\\em torque}\neffect and for the two-particle correlations in pseudorapidity,\n$C(\\eta_1,\\eta_2)$. The model framework involves event-by-event fluctuations of\nthe initial conditions, followed with 3D viscous hydrodynamic evolution and\nstatistical hadronization.\n", "  When applied to some models of noncommutative geometry, the formalism of\nrelative locality predicts the occurrence of a delay in the time of arrival of\nmassless particle of different energies emitted by a distant observer. In this\nletter, we show that this is not the case with Snyder spacetime, essentially\nbecause the Lorentz invariance is not deformed in this case. This conclusion is\nin accordance with the findings of doubly special relativity. Distant observers\nmay however measure different times of flight for massive particle.\n", "  A system with many degrees of freedom can be characterized by a covariance\nmatrix; principal components analysis (PCA) focuses on the eigenvalues of this\nmatrix, hoping to find a lower dimensional description. But when the spectrum\nis nearly continuous, any distinction between components that we keep and those\nthat we ignore becomes arbitrary; it then is natural to ask what happens as we\nvary this arbitrary cutoff. We argue that this problem is analogous to the\nmomentum shell renormalization group (RG). Following this analogy, we can\ndefine relevant and irrelevant operators, where the role of dimensionality is\nplayed by properties of the eigenvalue density. These results also suggest an\napproach to the analysis of real data. As an example, we study neural activity\nin the vertebrate retina as it responds to naturalistic movies, and find\nevidence of behavior controlled by a nontrivial fixed point. Applied to\nfinancial data, our analysis separates modes dominated by sampling noise from a\nsmaller but still macroscopic number of modes described by a non--Gaussian\ndistribution.\n", "  The non extensive aspects of $p_T$ distributions obtained in high energy\ncollisions are discussed in relation to possible fractal structure in hadrons,\nin the sense of the thermofractal structure recently introduced. The evidences\nof self-similarity in both theoretical and experimental works in High Energy\nand in Hadron Physics are discussed, to show that the idea of fractal structure\nof hadrons and fireballs have being under discussion for decades. The non\nextensive self-consistent thermodynamics and the thermofractal structure allow\none to connect non extensivity to intermittence and possibly to parton\ndistribution functions in a single theoretical framework.\n", "  In the present paper we examine the risk-sensitive and sampling issues\nassociated with the problem of calculating generalized averages. By combining\nthermodynamic integration and Stationary Phase Monte Carlo techniques, we\ndevelop an approach for such problems and explore its utility for a\nprototypical class of applications.\n", "  We prove the longstanding conjecture stating that Gaussian thermal input\nstates minimize the output von Neumann entropy of one-mode phase-covariant\nquantum Gaussian channels among all the input states with a given entropy.\nPhase-covariant quantum Gaussian channels model the attenuation and the noise\nthat affect any electromagnetic signal in the quantum regime. Our result is\ncrucial to prove the converse theorems for both the triple trade-off region and\nthe capacity region for broadcast communication of the Gaussian quantum-limited\namplifier. Our result extends to the quantum regime the Entropy Power\nInequality that plays a key role in classical information theory. Our proof\nexploits a completely new technique based on the recent determination of the\np->q norms of the quantum-limited amplifier [De Palma et al.,\narXiv:1610.09967]. This technique can be applied to any quantum channel.\n", "  We consider two kinds of pumped Langmuir waves (LWs) in the kinetic regime,\n$k\\lambda_D\\gtrsim0.2,$ where $k$ is the LW wavenumber and $\\lambda_D$ is the\nDebye length. They are driven to finite amplitude by a coherent external\npotential whose amplitude is either weak or strong. These dynamically prepared\nnonlinear LWs develop a transverse (filamentation) instability whose nonlinear\nevolution destroys the LW's transverse coherence. Instability growth rates in\nthe weakly pumped regime are the same as those of BGK modes considered in Part\nI, while strongly pumped LWs have higher filamentation grow rates.\n", "  Conventional microscope objective lenses are diffraction limited, which means\nthat they cannot resolve features smaller than half the illumination\nwavelength. Under white light illumination, such resolution limit is about\n250-300 nm for an ordinary microscope. In this paper, we demonstrate a new\nsuperlensing objective lens which has a resolution of about 100 nm, offering at\nleast two times resolution improvement over conventional objectives in\nresolution. This is achieved by integrating a conventional microscope objective\nlens with a superlensing microsphere lens using a 3D printed lens adaptor. The\nnew objective lens was used for label-free super-resolution imaging of 100\nnm-sized engineering and biological samples, including a Blu-ray disc sample,\nsemiconductor chip and adenoviruses. Our work creates a solid base for\ndeveloping a commercially-viable superlens prototype, which has potential to\ntransform the field of optical microscopy and imaging.\n", "  We study both the wave-like behavior and particle-like behavior in a general\nMach-Zehnder interferometer with its asymmetric beam splitter. A error-free\nmeasurement in the detector is used to extract the which-path information. The\nfringe visibility V and the which-path information Ipath are derived: their\ncomplementary relation V + Ipath less than or equal to 1 are found, and the\ncondition for the equality is also presented.\n", "  The possibility to construct an inflationary universe scenario for the\nfinite-scale gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is investigated. This model can be\ndescribed by the Higgs-Yukawa type interaction model with the corresponding\ncompositeness scale. Therefore, the one-loop Higgs-Yukawa effective potential\nis used with the compositeness condition for the study of inflationary\ndynamics. We evaluate the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background for\nthe model with a finite compositeness scale in the slow-roll approximation. We\nfind the remarkable dependence on the gauge group and the number of fermion\nflavors. It is also proved that the model has similar behavior with the\n$\\phi^{4n}$ chaotic inflation and the Starobinsky model at the flat and steep\nlimits, respectively. It is demonstrated that realistic inflation consistent\nwith Planck data is possible for a range of theory parameters.\n", "  We compute meson scattering amplitudes using the holographic duality between\nconfining gauge theories and string theory, in order to consider holographic\ncorrections to the Veneziano amplitude and associated higher-point functions.\nThe generic nature of such computations is explained, thanks to the\nwell-understood nature of confining string backgrounds, and two different\nexamples of the calculation in given backgrounds are used to illustrate the\ndetails. The effect we discover, whilst only qualitative, is re-obtainable in\nmany such examples, in four-point but also higher point amplitudes.\n", "  A laser pulse guided in a curved plasma channel can excite wakefields that\nsteer electrons along an arched trajectory. As the electrons are accelerated\nalong the curved channel, they emit synchrotron radiation. We present simple\nanalytical models and simulations examining laser pulse guiding, wakefield\ngeneration, electron steering, and synchrotron emission in curved plasma\nchannels. For experimentally realizable parameters, a ~2 GeV electron emits 0.1\nphotons per cm with an average photon energy of multiple keV.\n", "  We study the correspondence between modulational instability and types of\nfundamental nonlinear excitation in a nonlinear fiber with both third-order and\nfourth-order effects. Some stable soliton excitations are obtained in\nmodulational instability regime, which have not been found in nonlinear fibers\nwith second-order effects and third-order effects. Explicit analysis suggests\nthat the stable soliton existence is related with the modulation stability\ncircle in the modulation instability regime, and they just exist in the\nmodulational instability regime outside of the modulational stability circle.\nIt should be emphasized that the stable soliton just exist with two special\nprofiles on a continuous wave background with certain frequency. The evolution\nstability of the solitons is tested numerically, which indicate they are robust\nagainst perturbations even in modulation instability regime. The further\nanalysis indicates that the solitons in modulational instability regime are\ncaused by the fourth-order effects.\n", "  We consider the O(alpha alpha_s) corrections to single on-shell gauge boson\nproduction at hadron colliders. We concentrate on the contribution of all the\nsubprocesses where the gauge boson is accompanied by the emission of two\nadditional real partons and we evaluate the corresponding total cross sections.\nThe latter are divergent quantities, because of soft and collinear emissions,\nand are expressed as Laurent series in the dimensional regularization\nparameter. The total cross sections are evaluated by means of reverse\nunitarity, i.e. expressing the phase-space integrals in terms of two-loop\nforward box integrals with cuts on the final state particles. The results are\nreduced to a combination of Master Integrals, which eventually are evaluated in\nterms of Generalized Polylogarithms. The presence of internal massive lines in\nthe Feynman diagrams, due to the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons, causes\nthe appearance of 14 Master Integrals which were not previously known in the\nliterature and have been evaluated via Differential Equations.\n", "  We study four-dimensional N=1, 2 superconformal theory in class S obtained by\ncompactifying the 6d N=(2, 0) theory on a Riemann surface C with\nouter-automorphism twist lines. From the pair-of-pants decompositions C we find\nvarious dual descriptions for the same theory having distinct gauge groups. We\nshow that the various configurations of the twist line give rise to dual\ndescriptions for the identical theory. We compute the 't Hooft anomaly\ncoefficients and the superconformal indices to test dualities. Surprisingly, we\nfind that the class S theories with twist lines wrapping 1-cycles of C have the\nidentical 't Hooft anomalies as the ones without the twist line, whereas the\nsuperconformal indices differ. This provides a set of examples where the\nanomaly matching is insufficient to test dualities.\n", "  Electron-electron correlation effects play an instrumental role in our\nunderstanding of sequential (SDI) and non-sequential double ionization (NSDI)\nmechanisms. Here, we present a theoretical study of NSDI driven by\nplasmonic-enhanced spatial inhomogeneous fields. By numerically solving the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a linear reduced model of He and a\ndouble-electron time-evolution probability analysis, we provide evidence for\nthe enhancement effects in NSDI showing that the double ionization yield at\nlower laser peak intensities is increased due to the inhomogeneity of the laser\nfield. Furthermore, our quantum mechanical model, as well as classical\ntrajectory Monte Carlo simulations, show that inhomogeneous fields are a useful\ntool for splitting the binary and recoil processes in the rescattering\nscenario.\n", "  The particle-particle random phase approximation (pp-RPA) has been shown to\nbe capable of describing double, Rydberg, and charge transfer excitations, for\nwhich the conventional time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) might\nnot be suitable. It is thus desirable to reduce the computational cost of\npp-RPA so that it can be efficiently applied to larger molecules and even\nsolids. This paper introduces an $O(N^3)$ algorithm, where $N$ is the number of\norbitals, based on an interpolative separable density fitting technique and the\nJacobi-Davidson eigensolver to calculate a few low-lying excitations in the\npp-RPA framework. The size of the pp-RPA matrix can also be reduced by keeping\nonly a small portion of orbitals with orbital energy close to the Fermi energy.\nThis reduced system leads to a smaller prefactor of the cubic scaling\nalgorithm, while keeping the accuracy for the low-lying excitation energies.\n", "  The well-known Gouy-Stodola theorem states that a device produces maximum\nuseful power when working reversibly, that is with no entropy production inside\nthe device. This statement then leads to a method of thermodynamic optimization\nbased on entropy production minimization. Exergy destruction (difference\nbetween exergy of fuel and exhausts) is also given by entropy production inside\nthe device. Therefore, assessing efficiency of a device by exergy analysis is\nalso based on the Gouy-Stodola theorem. However, assumptions that had led to\nthe Gouy-Stodola theorem are not satisfied in several optimization scenarios,\ne.g. non-isothermal steady-state fuel cells, where both entropy production\nminimization and exergy analysis should be used with caution. We demonstrate,\nusing non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a few cases where entropy production\nminimization and exergy analysis should not be applied.\n", "  The pressure and internal energy of an ultracold plasma in a state of\nquasi-equilibrium are evaluated using classical molecular dynamics simulations.\nCoulomb collapse is avoided by modeling electron-ion interactions using an\nattractive Coulomb potential with a repulsive core. We present a method to\nseparate the contribution of classical bound states, which form due to\nrecombination, from the contribution of free charges when evaluating these\nthermodynamic state variables. It is found that the contribution from free\ncharges is independent of the choice of repulsive core length-scale when it is\nsufficiently short-ranged. The partial pressure associated with the free\ncharges is found to closely follow that of the one-component plasma model,\nreaching negative values at strong coupling, while the total system pressure\nremains positive. This pseudo-potential model is also applied to\nDebye-H\\\"{u}ckel theory to describe the weakly coupled regime.\n", "  This work focuses on the calculation of the large-volume behaviour of form\nfactors of local operators in the XXZ spin-$1/2$ chain taken between the ground\nstate and an excited state containing bound states. The analysis is rigorous\nand builds on various fine properties of the string solutions to the Bethe\nequations and certain technical hypotheses. These technical hypotheses are\nsatisfied for a generic excited state. The results obtained in this work pave\nthe way for extracting, starting from the first principles, the large-distance\nand long-time asymptotic behaviour of the XXZ chain's two-point functions just\nas the so-called edge singularities of their Fourier transforms.\n", "  3D printing is rapidly becoming an effective means of prototyping and\ncreating custom consumer goods. The most common method for printing a polymer\nmelt is fused filament fabrication (FFF), and involves extrusion of a\nthermoplastic material through a heated nozzle; the material is then built up\nlayer-by-layer to fabricate a three-dimensional object. Under typical printing\nconditions the melt experiences high strain rates within the FFF nozzle, which\nare able to significantly stretch and orient the polymer molecules. In this\npaper, we model the deformation of an amorphous polymer melt during the\nextrusion process, where the fluid must make a 90$^\\text{o}$ turn. The melt is\ndescribed by a modified version of the Rolie-Poly model, which allows for\nflow-induced changes in the entanglement density. The complex polymer\nconfigurations in the cross-section of a printed layer are quantified and\nvisualised. The deposition process involving the corner flow geometry dominates\nthe deformation and significantly disentangles the melt.\n", "  Negative parity states in $^{20}$Ne and Gamow-Teller strength distribution\nfor the ground-state beta-decay of $^{20}$Na are calculated for the very first\ntime using recently developed No-Core Configuration-Interaction model. The\napproach is based on multi-reference density functional theory involving\nisospin and angular-momentum projections. Advantages and shortcomings of the\nmethod are briefly discussed.\n", "  Many biological materials consist of sparse networks of disordered fibres,\nembedded in a soft elastic matrix. The interplay between rigid and soft\nelements in such composite networks leads to mechanical properties that can go\nfar beyond the sum of those of the constituents. Here we present lattice-based\nsimulations to unravel the microscopic origins of this mechanical synergy. We\nshow that the competition between fibre stretching and bending and elastic\ndeformations of the matrix gives rise to distinct mechanical regimes, with\nphase transitions between them that are characterized by critical behaviour and\ndiverging strain fluctuations and with different mechanisms leading to\nmechanical enhancement.\n", "  Many-body systems constructed of quantum-optical building blocks can now be\nrealized in experimental platforms ranging from exciton-polariton fluids to\nultracold gases of Rydberg atoms, establishing a fascinating interface between\ntraditional many-body physics and the driven-dissipative, non-equilibrium\nsetting of cavity-QED. At this interface, the standard techniques and\nintuitions of both fields are called into question, obscuring issues as\nfundamental as the role of fluctuations, dimensionality, and symmetry on the\nnature of collective behavior and phase transitions. Here, we study the\ndriven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, a minimal description of numerous\natomic, optical, and solid-state systems in which particle loss is countered by\ncoherent driving. Despite being a lattice version of optical bistability---a\nfoundational and patently non-equilibrium model of cavity-QED---the steady\nstate possesses an emergent equilibrium description in terms of a classical\nIsing model. We establish this picture by identifying a limit in which the\nquantum dynamics is asymptotically equivalent to non-equilibrium Langevin\nequations, which support a phase transition described by model A of the\nHohenberg-Halperin classification. Numerical simulations of the Langevin\nequations corroborate this picture, producing results consistent with the\nbehavior of a finite-temperature Ising model.\n", "  We evaluated for the first time the use of nanostructured layered perovskites\nof formulae LnBaCo2O6-d with Ln = Sm and Gd (SBCO and GBCO, respetively) as\nSOFC cathodes, finding promising electrochemical properties in the intermediate\ntemperature range (~700{\\deg}C). The synthesis of these nanomaterials, not\nreported before, was achieved by using porous templates to confine the chemical\nreagents in regions of about 200 nm and 800 nm. The performance of\nnanostructured SBCO and GBCO cathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction was\nanalyzed in symmetrical cells using Gd2O3-doped CeO2 (GDC) as electrolyte. For\nthis purpose, nanostructured SBCO and GBCO cathodes were deposited on both\nsides of the electrolyte by a simple thick-film procedure and evaluated by\nElectrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy technique under different operating\nconditions. We found that cathodes synthesized using smaller template pores\nexhibited better performance. Besides, SBCO cathodes displayed lower\narea-specific resistance than GBCO ones.\n", "  We consider the phase separation problem for the one--dimensional\nferromagnetic Ising model with long--range two--body interaction,\n$J(n)=n^{-2+\\a}$ where $n\\in \\N$ denotes the distance of the two spins and $\n\\alpha \\in ]0,\\a_+[$ with $\\a_+=(\\log 3)/(\\log 2) -1$. We prove that given\n$m\\in ]-1,+1[$, if the temperature is small enough, then typical configuration\nfor the $\\mu^{+}$ Gibbs measure conditionally to have a empirical magnetization\nof the order $m$ are made of a single interval that occupy almost a proportion\n$\\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{m}{m_\\b})$ of the volume with the minus phase inside and\nthe rest of the volume is the plus phase, here $m_\\b>0 $ is the spontaneous\nmagnetization.\n", "  We discuss emergence of geometrical scaling as a consequence of the nonlinear\nevolution equations of QCD, which generate a new dynamical scale, known as the\nsaturation momentum: Qs. In the kinematical region where no other energy scales\nexist, particle spectra exhibit geometrical scaling (GS), i.e. they depend on\nthe ratio pT=Qs, and the energy dependence enters solely through the energy\ndependence of the saturation momentum. We confront the hypothesis of GS in\ndifferent systems with experimental data.\n", "  A new scenario of thermalization process of the adsorbate attached at solid\nsurfaces is proposed. The scenario is based on existence of electric dipole\nlayer in which the electron wavefunctions extend over the positive ions. Thus\nthe strong local electric field exists which drags electron into the solids and\nrepels the positive ions. The electrons are tunneling conveying the energy into\nthe solid interior. The positive ions are retarded in the field, which allows\nthem to loose excess kinetic energy and to be located smoothly into the\nadsorption sites. In this way the excess energy is not dissipated locally\navoiding melting or creation of defects, in accordance with the experiments.\nThe scenario is supported by the ab intio calculation results including density\nfunction theory of the slabs representing AlN surface and the Schrodinger\nequation for time evolution of hydrogen-like atom at the solid surface.\n", "  We investigate the integrable aspects of the planar $\\gamma$-deformed ABJM\ntheory and propose the twisted asymptotic Bethe ansatz equations. A more\ngeneral method through a twisted generating functional is discussed, based on\nwhich, the asymptotic large L solution of Y-system is modified in order to\nmatch the asymptotic Bethe ansatz equations. Several applications of our method\nwere made in the $sl(2)$-like sector and some important examples in\n$\\beta$-deformed ABJM are presented as well.\n", "  BTZ black holes are excellent laboratories for studying black hole\nthermodynamics which is a bridge between classical general relativity and\nquantum nature of gravitation. In addition, three-dimensional gravity could\nhave equipped us for exploring some of the ideas behind the two dimensional\nconformal field theory based on the $AdS_{3}/CFT_{2}$. Considering the\nsignificant interests in these regards, we examine charged BTZ black holes. We\nconsider the system contains massive gravity with energy dependent spacetime to\nenrich the results. In order to make high curvature (energy) BTZ black holes\nmore realistic, we modify the theory by energy dependent constants. We\ninvestigate thermodynamic properties of the solutions by calculating heat\ncapacity and free energy. We also analyze thermal stability and study the\npossibility of Hawking-Page phase transition. At last, we study geometrical\nthermodynamics of these black holes and compare the results of various\napproaches.\n", "  We present the four-dimensional non-extremal dyonic black hole solution for\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory in absence of a scalar potential written in\nterms of integration constants only. These integration constants must satisfy a\nset of conditions imposed by the equations of motion. By defining a posteriori\nthe mass $M$ of the black hole and the dilaton charge $\\Sigma$, we show how to\nrecover the dyonic black hole solution found by Kallosh et.al. In particular,\nour analysis show that there is a possibility in defining whether the dilaton\ncharge or the mass of the black hole is an independent parameter. When the mass\nof the black hole is the independent parameter, then there is a well-defined\nlimit in which the dilaton charge is zero. For this case, it is straightforward\nto provide an answer to why is $\\phi_{H, \\text{extreme}}$ independent of\n$\\phi_{0}$ and to why $\\phi_{H, \\text{extreme}}=\\phi_{0}$ when the dilaton\ncharge is zero.\n", "  The surface orientation can have profound effects on the atomic-scale\nprocesses of crystal growth, and is essential to such technologies as GaN-based\nlight-emitting diodes and high-power electronics. We investigate the dependence\nof homoepitaxial growth mechanisms on the surface orientation of a hexagonal\ncrystal using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. To model GaN metal-organic vapor\nphase epitaxy, in which N species are supplied in excess, only Ga atoms on a\nhexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice are considered. The results are thus\npotentially applicable to any HCP material. Growth behaviors on c-plane ${(0 0\n0 1)}$ and m-plane ${(0 1 \\overline{1} 0)}$ surfaces are compared. We present a\nreciprocal space analysis of the surface morphology, which allows extraction of\ngrowth mode boundaries and direct comparison with surface X-ray diffraction\nexperiments. For each orientation we map the boundaries between 3-dimensional,\nlayer-by-layer, and step flow growth modes as a function of temperature and\ngrowth rate. Two models for surface diffusion are used, which produce different\neffective Ehrlich-Schwoebel step-edge barriers, and different adatom diffusion\nanisotropies on m-plane surfaces. Simulation results in agreement with observed\nGaN island morphologies and growth mode boundaries are obtained. These indicate\nthat anisotropy of step edge energy, rather than adatom diffusion, is\nresponsible for the elongated islands observed on m-plane surfaces. Island\nnucleation spacing obeys a power-law dependence on growth rate, with exponents\nof -0.24 and -0.29 for m- and c-plane, respectively.\n", "  We discuss the zero mass pointlike solutions and charged Einstein-Rosen\nbridges (wormholes) that arise from the dyonic black hole solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. These massless black holes exist individually\nin spacetime, different from the known massless solutions, which come in pairs\nwith opposite signs for their masses. In order to construct a massless object,\nwe choose the integration constants of the solution to have specific values.\nThe massless solutions present some problems: in one case the dilaton field is\ncomplex (or the gauge field has negative kinetic energy), and in the other case\nthe solution has negative entropy and temperature or it is naked singularity in\nthe extremal limit. For the first case, the observables computed are real\nquantities. This massless solution also allow the bridge construction, and we\nobtain an analytical and static charged wormhole solution, which satisfies the\nnull energy condition.\n", "  By considering infinite matter constraints only, we suggest in this paper\nthat the Gogny interaction should benefit from a third Gaussian in its central\npart. A statistical analysis is given to select the possible ranges which are\ncompatible with these constraints and which minimize a $\\chi^2$ function.\n", "  Anthropogenic effects on the space environment started in the late 19th\ncentury and reached their peak in the 1960s when high-altitude nuclear\nexplosions were carried out by the USA and the Soviet Union. These explosions\ncreated artificial radiation belts near Earth that resulted in major damages to\nseveral satellites. Another, unexpected impact of the high-altitude nuclear\ntests was the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that can have devastating effects\nover a large geographic area (as large as the continental United States). Other\nanthropogenic impacts on the space environment include chemical release ex-\nperiments, high-frequency wave heating of the ionosphere and the interaction of\nVLF waves with the radiation belts. This paper reviews the fundamental physical\nprocess behind these phenomena and discusses the observations of their impacts.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of field-induced magnetic phases in the\nhoneycomb Kitaev-Heisenberg model, which is believed to describe the essential\nphysics of Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling such as $A_2$IrO$_3$\nand $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We obtain a finite temperature phase diagram based on\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations and analytical calculations. We show that,\nwhile Zeeman coupling favors a symmetric non-coplanar magnetic order, thermal\nfluctuations enhances the stability of a collinear zigzag phase that breaks the\nrotational symmetry of the lattice. Our large-scale simulations also uncover\nintriguing commensurate-incommensurate transitions and multiple-$\\mathbf Q$\nincommensurate phases at high field. Experimental implications are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The variational multiparticle-multihole configuration mixing approach (MPMH)\nto nuclei has been proposed about a decade ago. While the first applications\nfollowed rapidly, the implementation of the full formalism of this method has\nonly been recently completed and applied in [C. Robin, N. Pillet, D. Pe\\~na\nArteaga and J.-F. Berger, Phys. Rev. C 93, 024302 (2016)] to $^{12}$C as a\ntest-case. The main objective of the present paper is to carry on the study\nthat was initiated in that reference, in order to put the MPMH method to more\nstringent tests. To that aim we perform a systematic study of even-even\nsd-shell nuclei. The wave function of these nuclei is taken as a configuration\nmixing built on orbitals of the sd-shell, and both the mixing coefficients of\nthe nuclear state and the single-particle wave functions are determined\nconsistently from the same variational principle. The calculations are done\nusing the D1S Gogny force. Various ground-state properties are analyzed. In\nparticular, the correlation content and composition of the wave function as\nwell as the single-particle orbitals and energies are examined. Binding\nenergies and charge radii are also calculated and compared to experiment. The\ndescription of the first excited state is also examined and the corresponding\ntransition densities are used as input for the calculation of inelastic\nelectron and proton scattering. Special attention is paid to the effect of the\noptimization of the single-particle states consistently with the correlations\nof the system. Globally, the results are satisfying and encouraging. In\nparticular, charge radii and excitation energies are nicely reproduced.\nHowever, the chosen valence-space truncation scheme precludes achieving maximum\ncollectivity in the studied nuclei. Further refinement of the method and a\nbetter-suited interaction are necessary to remedy this situation.\n", "  We investigate exclusive leptoproduction of $\\rho^0$ meson. These reactions\nwere analyzed within the factorizing handbag approach. In our model good\nagreement of observables for light meson production with experimental data in a\nwide energy range was found.\n  Using the model results we calculate the ratio of different helicity\namplitudes for a transversely polarized proton target to the leading twist\nlongitudinal amplitude. Our results are close to the amplitude ratios measured\nby HERMES.\n", "  Magnetic flux plays an important role in compactifications of field and\nstring theories in two ways, it generates a multiplicity of chiral fermion zero\nmodes and it can break supersymmetry. We derive the complete four-dimensional\neffective action for N=1 supersymmetric Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories\nin six dimensions compactified on a torus with flux. The effective action\ncontains the tower of charged states and it accounts for the mass spectrum of\nbosonic and fermionic fields as well as their level-dependent interactions.\nThis allows us to compute quantum corrections to the mass and couplings of\nWilson lines. We find that the one-loop corrections vanish, contrary to the\ncase without flux. This can be traced back to the spontaneous breaking of a\nsymmetry of the six-dimensional theory by the background gauge field, with the\nWilson line as Goldstone boson.\n", "  We first consider the idea of renormalization group-induced estimates, in the\ncontext of optimization procedures, for the Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie approach\nto generate higher-order contributions to QCD perturbative series. Secondly, we\ndevelop the deviation pattern approach (DPA) in which through a series of\ncomparisons between lower-order RG-induced estimates and the corresponding\nanalytical calculations, one could modify higher-order RG-induced estimates.\nFinally, using the normal estimation procedure and DPA, we get estimates of\n$\\alpha_s^4$ corrections for the Bjorken sum rule of polarized deep-inelastic\nscattering and for the non-singlet contribution to the Adler function.\n", "  We compute the masses of even spin glueball states $ J^{PC} $, with $ P=C=+1\n$, using a twist two operator from an AdS/QCD model known as the hardwall\nmodel, using Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Within this approach,\nwe found that the glueball masses are comparable with those in literature. From\nthese masses, we obtained the Pomeron Regge trajectories for both boundary\nconditions in agreement with experimental data available and other holographic\nmodels.\n", "  The concept of the X3D pathway was introduced by Vogt et al. (2016) as a new\napproach to sharing and publishing 3-D structures interactively in online\nscientific journals. The core characteristics of the X3D pathway are that: 1)\nit does not rely on specific software, but rather a file format (X3D), 2) it\ncan be implemented using fully open-source tools, and 3) article readers can\naccess the interactive models using most main stream web browsers without the\nneed for any additional plugins. In this article, we further demonstrate the\npotential of the X3D pathway to visualize datasets from optical integral field\nspectrographs. We use recent observations of the oxygen-rich young supernova\nremnant 1E0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to implement additional\nX3DOM tools & techniques and expand the range of interactions that can be\noffered to article readers. In particular, we present a set of javascript\nfunctions allowing the creation and interactive handling of clip planes,\neffectively allowing users to take measurements of distances and angles\ndirectly from the interactive model itself.\n", "  Biaxial strain effects on electronic structures and thermoelectric properties\nof monolayer $\\mathrm{PtTe_2}$ are investigated by using generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the electron part and\nGGA for the phonon part. Calculated results show that small compressive strain\n(about -3\\%) can induce semiconductor-to-metal transition, which can easily be\nachieved in experiment. The conduction bands convergence is observed for\nunstrained $\\mathrm{PtTe_2}$, which can be removed by both compressive and\ntensile strains. Tensile strain can give rise to valence bands convergence by\nchanging the position of valence band maximum (VBM), which can induce enhanced\nSeebeck coefficient, being favorable for high power factor. It is found that\ntensile strain can also reduce lattice thermal conductivity, which at the\nstrain of 4\\% can decrease by about 19\\% compared to unstrained one at room\ntemperature. By considering tensile strain effects on $ZT_e$ and lattice\nthermal conductivity, tensile strain indeed can improve p-type efficiency of\nthermoelectric conversion. Our results demonstrate the potential of strain\nengineering in $\\mathrm{PtTe_2}$ for applications in electronics and\nthermoelectricity.\n", "  The density functional theory (DFT) is based on the existence and uniqueness\nof a universal functional $E[\\rho]$, which determines the dependence of the\ntotal energy on single-particle density distributions. However, DFT says\nnothing about the form of the functional. Our strategy is to first look at what\nwe know, from independent considerations, about the analytical density\ndependence of the energy of nuclear matter and then, for practical\napplications, to obtain an appropriate density-dependent effective interaction\nby reverse engineering. In a previous work on homogeneous matter, we identified\nthe most essential terms to include in our \"KIDS\" functional, named after the\nearly-stage participating institutes. We now present first results for finite\nnuclei, namely the energies and radii of $^{16,28}$O, $^{40,60}$Ca.\n", "  A robust prediction model invoking the Takens embedding theorem, whose\n\\textit{working hypothesis} is obtained via an inference procedure based on the\nminimum Fisher information principle, is presented. The coefficients of the\nansatz, central to the \\textit{working hypothesis} satisfy a time independent\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-like equation in a vector setting. The inference of i) the\nprobability density function of the coefficients of the \\textit{working\nhypothesis} and ii) the establishing of constraint driven pseudo-inverse\ncondition for the modeling phase of the prediction scheme, is made, for the\ncase of normal distributions, with the aid of the quantum mechanical virial\ntheorem. The well-known reciprocity relations and the associated Legendre\ntransform structure for the Fisher information measure (FIM, hereafter)-based\nmodel in a vector setting (with least square constraints) are self-consistently\nderived. These relations are demonstrated to yield an intriguing form of the\nFIM for the modeling phase, which defines the \\textit{working hypothesis},\nsolely in terms of the observed data. Cases for prediction employing time\nseries' obtained from the: $(i)$ the Mackey-Glass delay-differential equation,\n$(ii)$ one ECG sample from the MIT-Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital (MIT-BIH)\ncardiac arrhythmia database, and $(iii)$ one ECG from the Creighton University\nventricular tachyarrhythmia database. The ECG samples were obtained from the\nPhysionet online repository. These examples demonstrate the efficiency of the\nprediction model. Numerical examples for exemplary cases are provided.\n", "  Plasmonic nanoarrays which support collective surface lattice resonances\n(SLRs) have become an exciting frontier in plasmonics. Compared with the\nlocalized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in individual particles, these\ncollective modes have appealing advantages such as angle-dependent dispersions\nand much narrower linewidths. Here, we investigate systematically how the\ngeometry of the lattice affects the SLRs supported by metallic nanoparticles.\nWe present a general theoretical framework from which the various SLR modes of\na given geometry can be straightforwardly obtained by a simple comparison of\nthe diffractive order (DO) vectors and orientation of the nanoparticle dipole\ngiven by the polarization of the incident field. Our experimental measurements\nshow that while square, hexagonal, rectangular, honeycomb and Lieb lattice\narrays have similar spectra near the $\\Gamma$-point ($k=0$), they have\nremarkably different SLR dispersions. Furthermore, their dispersions are highly\ndependent on the polarization. Numerical simulations are performed to elucidate\nthe field profiles of the different modes. Our findings extend the diversity of\nSLRs in plasmonic nanoparticle arrays, and the theoretical framework provides a\nsimple model for interpreting the SLRs features, and vice versa, for designing\nthe geometrical patterns.\n", "  We study asymmetric simple-current extensions of Gepner models in dimensions\n$D=4,6,8$ with at least eight supercharges in the right-moving sector. The\nmodels obtained in an extensive stochastic computer search belong to a small\nnumber of different classes. These classes can be categorized as dimensional\nreductions, asymmetric orbifolds with $(-1)^{F_L}$, extra gauge enhancement and\nas coming from the super Higgs-effect. Models in the latter class are\nparticularly interesting, as they may correspond to non-geometric flux\ncompactifications.\n", "  The determination of the fundamental parameters of the Standard Model (and\nits extensions) is often limited by the presence of statistical and theoretical\nuncertainties. We present several models for the latter uncertainties (random,\nnuisance, external) in the frequentist framework, and we derive the\ncorresponding $p$-values. In the case of the nuisance approach where\ntheoretical uncertainties are modeled as biases, we highlight the important,\nbut arbitrary, issue of the range of variation chosen for the bias parameters.\nWe introduce the concept of adaptive $p$-value, which is obtained by adjusting\nthe range of variation for the bias according to the significance considered,\nand which allows us to tackle metrology and exclusion tests with a single and\nwell-defined unified tool, which exhibits interesting frequentist properties.\nWe discuss how the determination of fundamental parameters is impacted by the\nmodel chosen for theoretical uncertainties, illustrating several issues with\nexamples from quark flavour physics.\n", "  By extracting unstable invariant solutions directly from body-forced\nthree-dimensional turbulence, we study the dynamical processes at play when the\nforcing is large scale and either unidirectional in the momentum or the\nvorticity equations. In the former case, the dynamical processes familiar from\nrecent work on linearly-stable shear flows - variously called the\nSelf-Sustaining Process (Waleffe 1997) or Vortex-Wave Interaction (Hall & Smith\n1991; Hall & Sherwin 2010) - are important even when the base flow is linearly\nunstable. In the latter case, where the forcing drives Taylor-Green vortices, a\nnumber of mechanisms are observed from the various types of periodic orbits\nisolated. In particular, two different transient growth mechanisms are\ndiscussed to explain the more complex states found.\n", "  Coherent sources of attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation present\nmany challenges if their full potential is to be realized. While many\napplications benefit from the broadband nature of these sources, it is also\ndesirable to produce narrow band XUV pulses, or to study autoionizing\nresonances in a manner that is free of the broad ionization background that\naccompanies above-threshold XUV excitation. Here we demonstrate a method for\ncontrolling the coherent XUV free induction decay that results from using\nattosecond pulses to excite a gas, yielding a fully functional modulator for\nXUV wavelengths. We use an infrared (IR) control pulse to manipulate both the\nspatial and spectral phase of the XUV emission, sending the light in a\ndirection of our choosing at a time of our choosing. This allows us to tailor\nthe light using opto-optical modulation, similar to devices available in the IR\nand visible wavelength regions.\n", "  Surface tension-driven flow techniques have recently emerged as an efficient\nmeans of shedding light into the rheology of thin polymer films. Motivated by\nexperimental and theoretical approaches in films bearing a varying surface\ntopography, we present results on the capillary relaxation of a square pattern\nat the free surface of a viscoelastic polymer film, using molecular dynamics\nsimulations of a coarse-grained polymer model. Height profiles are monitored as\na function of time after heating the system above its glass-transition\ntemperature and their time dependence is fitted to the theory of capillary\nleveling. Results show that the viscosity is not constant, but time dependent.\nIn addition to providing a complementary insight about the local inner\nmechanisms, our simulations of the capillary-leveling process therefore probe\nthe viscoelasticity of the polymer and not only its viscosity, in contrast to\nprevious experimental approaches.\n", "  We report a novel technique for launching broadband laser light into\nliquid-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (HC-PCF). It uniquely offers\nself-alignment and self-stabilization via optomechanical trapping of a fused\nsilica nanospike, fabricated by thermally tapering and chemically etching a\nsingle mode fiber into a tip diameter of 350 nm. We show that a trapping laser,\ndelivering ~300 mW at 1064 nm, can be used to optically align and stably\nmaintain the nanospike at the core center. Once this is done, a broadband\nsupercontinuum beam (~575 to 1064 nm) can be efficiently and close to\nachromatically launched in the HC-PCF. The system is robust against liquid-flow\nin either direction inside the HC-PCF and the Fresnel back-reflections are\nreduced to negligible levels compared to free-space launching or butt-coupling.\nThe results are of potential relevance for any application where the efficient\ndelivery of broadband light into liquid-core waveguides is desired.\n", "  The gluon propagator is investigated at finite temperature via lattice\nsimulations. In particular, we discuss its interpretation as a massive-type\nbosonic propagator. Moreover, we compute the corresponding spectral density and\nstudy the violation of spectral positivity. Finally, we explore the dependence\nof the gluon propagator on the phase of the Polyakov loop.\n", "  In an effort to characterize the fast neutron radiation background, 16 EJ-309\nliquid scintillator cells were installed in the Radiological Multi-sensor\nAnalysis Platform (RadMAP) to collect data in the San Francisco Bay Area. Each\nfast neutron event was associated with specific weather metrics (pressure,\ntemperature, absolute humidity) and GPS coordinates. The expected exponential\ndependence of the fast neutron count rate on atmospheric pressure was\ndemonstrated and event rates were subsequently adjusted given the measured\npressure at the time of detection. Pressure adjusted data was also used to\ninvestigate the influence of other environmental conditions on the neutron\nbackground rate. Using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\ncoastal area lidar data, an algorithm was implemented to approximate sky-view\nfactors (the total fraction of visible sky) for points along RadMAPs route.\nThree areas analyzed in San Francisco, Downtown Oakland, and Berkeley all\ndemonstrated a suppression in the background rate of over 50% for the range of\nsky-view factors measured. This effect, which is due to the shielding of\ncosmic-ray produced neutrons by surrounding buildings, was comparable to the\npressure influence which yielded a 32% suppression in the count rate over the\nrange of pressures measured.\n", "  The large class of inflationary models known as $\\alpha$- and\n$\\xi$-attractors gives identical cosmological predictions at tree level (at\nleading order in inverse power of the number of efolds). Working with the\nrenormalization group improved action, we show that these predictions are\nrobust under quantum corrections. This means that for all the models considered\nthe inflationary parameters $(n_s,r)$ are (nearly) independent on the\nRenormalization Group flow. The result follows once the field dependence of the\nrenormalization scale, fixed by demanding the leading log correction to vanish,\nsatisfies a quite generic condition. In Higgs inflation (which is a particular\n$\\xi$-attractor) this is indeed the case; in the more general attractor models\nthis is still ensured by the renormalizability of the theory in the effective\nfield theory sense.\n", "  We investigate interactions by means of direct numerical simulations between\ntwo finite Airy-Gaussian (AiG) beams in different media with the defected\nphotonic lattices in one transverse dimension. We discuss different lattice\nstructures in which the beams with different intensities and phases are\nlaunched into the medium, but accelerate in opposite directions. During\ninteractions we see the interference fringe, breathers and soliton pairs\ngenerated that are not accelerating. In the linear media, the initial\ndeflection direction of the accelerated beams is changed by adjusting the phase\nshift and the beam interval. For a certain lattice period, the periodic\ninterference fringe can form. A constructive or destructive interference can\nvary with the defect depth and phase shift. While the nonlinearity is\nintroduced, the breathers is generated. Especially, the appropriate beam\namplitude and lattice depth may lead to the formation of soliton pairs.\n", "  We describe a method for investigating the integrable character of a given\nthree-point mapping, provided that the mapping has confined singularities. Our\nmethod, dubbed \"express\", is inspired by a novel approach recently proposed by\nR.G. Halburd. While the latter aims at computing the exact degree growth of a\ngiven mapping based on the structure of its singularities, we content ourselves\nwith obtaining an answer as to whether a given system is integrable or not. We\npresent several examples illustrating our method as well as its limitations. We\nalso compare the present method to the full-deautonomisation approach we\nrecently introduced.\n", "  In a recent study[Phys. Rev. B 92 (2015) 125427], a hyperspherical approach\nhas been developed to study of few-body fractional quantum Hall states. This\nmethod has been successfully applied to the exploration of few boson and\nfermion problems in the quantum Hall region, as well as the study of\ninter-Landau level collective excitations. However, the hyperspherical method\nas it is normally implemented requires a subsidiary (anti-)symmetrization\nprocess, which limits its computational effectiveness. The present work\novercomes these difficulties and extends the power of this method by\nimplementing a represen- tation of the hyperspherical many-body basis space in\nterms of Slater determinants of single particle eigenfunctions. A clear\nconnection between the hyperspherical representation and the conventional\nsingle particle picture is presented, along with a compact operator\nrepresentation of the theoretical framework.\n", "  We evaluate the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux using the different QCD\nmodels for heavy quark production including the $b$ quark contribution. We\ninclude the nuclear correction and find it reduces the fluxes by $10 \\% - 50\\%$\naccording to the models. Our heavy quark results are compared with experimental\ndata from RHIC, LHC and LHCb.\n", "  We study quantum Hall (QH) states on a punctured Riemann sphere. We compute\nthe Berry curvature under adiabatic motion in the moduli space in the large N\nlimit. The Berry curvature is shown to be finite in the large N limit and\ncontrolled by the conformal dimension of the cusp singularity, a local property\nof the mean density. Utilizing exact sum rules obtained from a Ward identity,\nwe show that for the Laughlin wave function, the dimension of a cusp\nsingularity is given by the central charge, a robust geometric response\ncoefficient in the QHE. Thus, adiabatic transport of curvature singularities\ncan be used to determine the central charge of QH states. We also consider the\neffects of threaded fluxes and spin-deformed wave functions. Finally, we give a\nclosed expression for all moments of the mean density in the integer QH state\non a punctured disk.\n", "  While a wealth of results has been obtained for chaos in single-particle\nquantum systems, much less is known about chaos in quantum many-body systems.\nWe contribute to recent efforts to make a semiclassical analysis of such\nsystems feasible, which is nontrivial due to the exponential proliferation of\norbits with increasing particle number. Employing a recently discovered duality\nrelation, we focus on the collective, coherent motion that together with the\nalso present incoherent one typically leads to a mixture of regular and chaotic\ndynamics. We investigate a kicked spin chain as an example of a presently\nexperimentally and theoretically much studied class of systems.\n", "  Swimming at low Reynolds number in Newtonian fluids is only possible through\nnon-reciprocal body deformations due to the kinematic reversibility of the\nStokes equations. We consider here a model swimmer consisting of two linked\nspheres, wherein one sphere is rigid and the other an incompressible\nneo-Hookean solid. The two spheres are connected by a rod which changes its\nlength periodically. We show that the deformations of the body are\nnon-reciprocal despite the reversible actuation and hence, the elastic\ntwo-sphere swimmer propels forward. Our results indicate that even weak elastic\ndeformations of a body can affect locomotion and may be exploited in designing\nartificial microswimmers.\n", "  Strongly first-order phase transitions, i.e., those with a large order\nparameter, are characterized by a considerable supercooling and high velocities\nof phase transition fronts. A very strong phase transition may have important\ncosmological consequences due to the departures from equilibrium caused in the\nplasma. In general, there is a limit to the strength, since the metastability\nof the old phase may prevent the transition to complete. Near this limit, the\nbubble nucleation rate achieves a maximum and thus departs from the widely\nassumed behavior in which it grows exponentially with time. We study the\ndynamics of this kind of phase transitions. We show that in some cases a\ngaussian approximation for the nucleation rate is more suitable, and in such a\ncase we solve analytically the evolution of the phase transition. We compare\nthe gaussian and exponential approximations with realistic cases and we\ndetermine their ranges of validity. We also discuss the implications for cosmic\nremnants such as gravitational waves.\n", "  We present an axially symmetric, asymptotically flat empty space solution of\nthe Einstein field equations containing a naked singularity. The spacetime is\nregular everywhere except on the symmetry axis where it possess a true\ncurvature singularity. The spacetime is of type D in the Petrov classification\nscheme and is locally isometric to the metrics of case IV in the Kinnersley\nclassification of type D vacuum metrics. Additionally, the spacetime also shows\nthe evolution of closed timelike curves (CTCs) from an initial hypersurface\nfree from CTCs.\n", "  We study holographic probes dual to heavy quark impurities interpolating\nbetween fundamental and symmetric/antisymmetric tensor representations in\nstrongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric gauge theory. These correspond to\nnon-conformal D3- and D5-brane probe embeddings in AdS_5 x S^5 exhibiting flows\non their world-volumes. By examining the asymptotic regimes of the embeddings\nand the one-point function of static fields sourced by the boundary impurity,\nwe conclude that the D5-brane embedding describes the screening of fundamental\nquarks in the UV into an antisymmetric source in the IR, whilst the\nnon-conformal, D3-brane solution interpolates between the symmetric\nrepresentation in the UV and fundamental sources in the IR. The D5-brane\nembeddings exhibit nontrivial thermodynamics with multiple branches of\nsolutions, whilst the thermal analogue of the interpolating D3-brane solution\ndoes not appear to exist.\n", "  In two recent papers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 116} (2016) 033201; Phys. Rev. A\n{\\bf 94} (2016) 032331), the possibility of continuously varying the degree of\nentanglement between an elastically scattered electron and the valence electron\nof an alkali target was discussed. In order to estimate how well such a scheme\nmay work in practice, we present results for elastic electron scattering from\nlithium in the energy regime of 1$-$5~eV and the full range of scattering\nangles $0^\\circ - 180^\\circ$. The most promising regime for Bell-correlations\nin this particular collision system are energies between about 1.5 eV and 3.0\neV, in an angular range around $110^\\circ \\pm 10^\\circ$. In addition to the\nrelative exchange asymmetry parameter, we present the differential cross\nsection that is important when estimating the count rate and hence the\nfeasibility of experiments using this system.\n", "  We use the formulation of conformal higher spin (CHS) theories in twistor\nspace to study their tree-level scattering amplitudes, finding expressions for\nall three-point anti-MHV amplitudes and all MHV amplitudes involving positive\nhelicity conformal gravity particles and two negative helicity higher spins.\nThis provides the on-shell analogue for the covariant coupling of CHS fields to\na conformal gravity background. We discuss the restriction of the theory to a\nghost-free unitary subsector, analogous to restricting conformal gravity to\ngeneral relativity with a cosmological constant. We study the flat-space limit\nand show that the restricted amplitudes vanish, supporting the conjecture that\nin the unitary sector the S-matrix of CHS theories is trivial. However, by\nappropriately rescaling the amplitudes we find non-vanishing results which we\ncompare with chiral flat-space higher spin theories.\n", "  The six planets of the Kepler-11 system are the archetypal example of a\npopulation of surprisingly low-density transiting planets revealed by the\nKepler mission. We have determined the fundamental parameters and chemical\ncomposition of the Kepler-11 host star to unprecedented precision using an\nextremely high quality spectrum from Keck-HIRES (R$\\simeq$67,000, S/N per\npixel$\\simeq$260 at 600 nm). Contrary to previously published results, our\nspectroscopic constraints indicate that Kepler-11 is a young main-sequence\nsolar twin. The revised stellar parameters and new analysis raise the densities\nof the Kepler-11 planets by between 20-95% per planet, making them more typical\nof the emerging class of \"puffy\" close-in exoplanets. We obtain photospheric\nabundances of 22 elements and find that Kepler-11 has an abundance pattern\nsimilar to that of the Sun with a slightly higher overall metallicity. We\nadditionally analyze the Kepler lightcurves using a photodynamical model and\ndiscuss the tension between spectroscopic and transit/TTV-based stellar density\nestimates.\n", "  The holographic entanglement entropies (HEE) associated with four dimensional\nSchwarzschild and Reisner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes in asymptotically Minkowski\nspacetimes are investigated. Unlike the cases of asymptotically AdS spacetimes\nfor which the boundaries are always taken at (timelike) conformal infinities,\nwe take the boundaries at either large but finite radial coordinate (far\nboundary) or very close to the black hole event horizons (near horizon\nboundary). The reason for such choices is that such boundaries are similar to\nthe conformal infinity of AdS spacetime in that they are all timelike, so that\nthere may be some hope to define dual systems with ordinary time evolution on\nsuch boundaries. Our results indicate that, in the case of far boundaries, the\nleading order contribution to the HEEs come from the background Minkowski\nspacetime, however, the next to leading order contribution which arises from\nthe presence of the black holes is always proportional to the black hole mass,\nwhich constitutes a version of the first law of the HEE for asymptotically flat\nspacetimes, and the higher order contributions are always negligibly small. In\nthe case of near horizon boundaries, the leading order contribution to the HEE\nis always proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon, and the\ncase of extremal RN black hole is distinguished from the cases of non-extremal\nblack holes in that the minimal surface defining the HEE is completely immersed\ninside the boundary up to the second order in the perturbative expansion.\n", "  A comprehensive study of the classical linear spin-down of a constant density\nviscous fluid (kinematic viscosity \\nu) rotating rapidly (angular velocity\n\\Omega) inside an axisymmetric cylindrical container (radius L, height H) with\nrigid boundaries, that follows the instantaneous small change in the boundary\nangular velocity at small Ekman number $E=\\nu/H^2\\Omega \\ll 1$, was provided by\nGreenspan & Howard (1963). $E^{1/2}$-Ekman layers form quickly triggering\ninertial waves together with the dominant spin-down of the quasi-geostrophic\n(QG) interior flow on the $O(E^{-1/2}\\Omega^{-1})$ time-scale. On the longer\nlateral viscous diffusion time-scale $O(L^2/\\nu)$, the QG-flow responds to the\n$E^{1/3}$-side-wall shear-layers. In our variant the side-wall and top\nboundaries are stress-free; a setup motivated by the study of isolated\natmospheric structures, such as tropical cyclones, or tornadoes. Relative to\nthe unbounded plane layer case, spin-down is reduced (enhanced) by the presence\nof a slippery (rigid) side-wall. This is evinced by the QG-angular velocity,\n\\omega*, evolution on the O(L^2/\\nu) time-scale: Spatially, \\omega* increases\n(decreases) outwards from the axis for a slippery (rigid) side-wall;\ntemporally, the long-time ($\\gg L^2/\\nu)$ behaviour is dominated by an\neigensolution with a decay rate slightly slower (faster) than that for an\nunbounded layer. In our slippery side-wall case, the $E^{1/2} \\times E^{1/2}$\ncorner region that forms at the side-wall intersection with the rigid base is\nresponsible for a $\\ln E$ singularity within the $E^{1/3}$-layer causing our\nasymptotics to apply only at values of E far smaller than can be reached by our\nDirect Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the entire spin-down process. Instead, we\nsolve the $E^{1/3}$-boundary-layer equations for given E numerically. Our\nhybrid asymptotic-numerical approach yields results in excellent agreement with\nour DNS.\n", "  In this article we study the two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Fermi gas with\nweak impurity in the framework of mean-field theory where the impurity is\nintroduced through Gaussian fluctuations. We have investigated the role of the\nimpurity by studying the experimentally accessible quantities such as\ncondensate fraction and equation of state of the ultracold systems. Our\nanalysis reveals that, at the crossover the disorder enhances superfluidity,\nwhich we attribute to the unique nature of the unitary region and to the\ndimensional effect.\n", "  The growth of computational astrophysics and complexity of multidimensional\ndatasets evidences the need for new versatile visualization tools for both\nanalysis and presentation of the data. In this work we show how to use the open\nsource software Blender as a 3D visualization tool to study and visualize\nnumerical simulation results, focusing on astrophysical hydrodynamic\nexperiments. With a datacube as input, the software can generate a volume\nrendering of the 3D data, show the evolution of a simulation in time, and do a\nfly-around camera animation to highlight the points of interest. We explain the\nprocess to import simulation outputs into Blender using the Voxel Data format,\nand how to set up a visualization scene in the software interface. This method\nallows scientists to perform a complementary visual analysis of their data, and\ndisplay their results in an appealing way, both for outreach and science\npresentations.\n", "  The magnetic ground state of the quasi-one-dimensional spin-1\nantiferromagnetic chain is sensitive to the relative sizes of the single-ion\nanisotropy ($D$) and the intrachain ($J$) and interchain ($J'$) exchange\ninteractions. The ratios $D/J$ and $J'/J$ dictate the material's placement in\none or other of three competing phases: a Haldane gapped phase, a quantum\nparamagnet and an XY-ordered state, with a quantum critical point at their\njunction. We have identified [Ni(HF)$_2$(pyz)$_2]$SbF$_6$, where pyz =\npyrazine, as a candidate in which this behavior can be explored in detail.\nCombining neutron scattering (elastic and inelastic) in applied magnetic fields\nof up to 10~tesla and magnetization measurements in fields of up to 60~tesla\nwith numerical modeling of experimental observables, we are able to obtain\naccurate values of all of the parameters of the Hamiltonian [$D = 13.3(1)$~K,\n$J = 10.4(3)$~K and $J' = 1.4(2)$~K], despite the polycrystalline nature of the\nsample. Density-functional theory calculations result in similar couplings ($J\n= 9.2$~K, $J' = 1.8$~K) and predict that the majority of the total spin\npopulation of resides on the Ni(II) ion, while the remaining spin density is\ndelocalized over both ligand types. The general procedures outlined in this\npaper permit phase boundaries and quantum-critical points to be explored in\nanisotropic systems for which single crystals are as yet unavailable.\n", "  We describe a deformation of the principal chiral model (with an\neven-dimensional target space G) by a B-field proportional to the K\\\"ahler form\non the target space. The equations of motion of the deformed model admit a\nzero-curvature representation. As a simplest example, we consider the case of\nG=S^1 x S^3. We also apply a variant of the construction to a deformation of\nthe AdS_3 x S^3 x S^1 (super-)sigma-model.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate a magnetically guided Cesium (Cs) atom\ninterferometer in the Talbot-Lau regime for inertial sensing with two\ninterferometer schemes, Mach-Zenhder and Ramsey-Borde. The recoil frequency of\nthe Cs atoms and the acceleration along the waveguide symmetry axis is\nmeasured. An acceleration measurement uncertainty of $7\\times10^{-5}$ m/s$^{2}$\nis achieved. We also realize an enclosed area of $0.018$ mm$^{2}$ for rotation\nmeasurement. As the first reported magnetically guided Cs atom interferometer,\nthe system limitation and its advantages are discussed.\n", "  Krypton-85 is an anthropogenic beta-decaying isotope which produces low\nenergy backgrounds in dark matter and neutrino experiments, especially those\nbased upon liquid xenon. Several technologies have been developed to reduce the\nKr concentration in such experiments. We propose to augment those separation\ntechnologies by first adding to the xenon an 85Kr-free sample of krypton in an\namount much larger than the natural krypton that is already present. After the\npurification system reduces the total Kr concentration to the same level, the\nfinal 85Kr concentration will have been reduced even further by the dilution\nfactor. A test cell for measurement of the activity of various Kr samples has\nbeen assembled, and the activity of 25-year-old Krypton has been measured. The\nmeasured activity agrees well with the expected activity accounting for the\n85Kr abundance of the earth atmosphere in 1990 and the half-life of the\nisotope. Additional tests with a Kr sample produced in the year 1944 (before\nthe atomic era) have been done in order to demonstrate the sensitivity of the\ntest cell.\n", "  Using a microfabricated, p-type GaAs Hall bar, is it shown that the combined\napplication of co-planar electric and magnetic fields enables the observation\nat 50 K of spatial oscillations of the photoluminescence circular polarization\ndue to the precession of drifting spin-polarized photoelec- trons. Observation\nof these oscillations as a function of electric field E gives a direct\nmeasurement of the minority carrier drift mobility and reveals that, for E =\n800 V/cm, spin coherence is preserved over a length as large as 25{\\mu}m.\n", "  Helium atom is the simplest many-body electronic system provided by nature.\nThe exact solution to the Schr\\\"odinger equation is known for helium ground and\nexcited states, and represents a workbench for any many-body methodology. Here,\nwe check the ab initio many-body GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation\n(BSE) against the exact solution for helium. Starting from Hartree-Fock, we\nshow that GW and BSE yield impressively accurate results on excitation energies\nand oscillator strength, systematically improving time-dependent Hartree-Fock.\nThese findings suggest that the accuracy of BSE and GW approximations is not\nsignificantly limited by self-interaction and self-screening problems even in\nthis few electron limit. We further discuss our results in comparison to those\nobtained by time-dependent density-functional theory.\n", "  The resistivity tensor correlations $\\rho_{xy}$($B$)$\\sim$\n$[\\rho_{xx}(B)]^\\beta$ for the mixed state magnetic field dependencies of the\nresistivity tensor of electron-doped Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$/SrTiO$_3$\nsingle crystal films near the antiferromagnetic (AF) - superconducting (SC)\nphase transition and with varying degree of disorder ($\\delta$) were studied.\nThe decrease of $\\beta$ from 1.2$\\pm$0.2 at $x$ = 0.14 to 0.6$\\pm$0.1 at $x$ =\n0.15 points out on the evidence of the change from the anisotropic $s$ - wave\nto the $d$ - wave pairing symmetry in the external magnetic field at the\ntransition from underdoped to optimally doped region. Peculiarities of the\npower law dependence of the vortex motion in the mixed state can be connected\nwith some features of the nonstoichiometric disorder in layered electron-doped\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We study the production of polarized $\\Lambda$ hyperon in semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering off an unpolarized target. We include the cases in which\nthe $\\Lambda$ hyperon is longitudinally polarized or transversely polarized,\nand in which the lepton beam is unpolarized or longitudinally polarized. Within\nthe framework of the transverse momentum dependent factorization, we take into\naccount the complete decomposition of the parton correlator for fragmentation\nup to twist-3. We present the cross section of the process to order $1/Q$. The\nexpressions of the polarized structure functions, which may give rise to\nvarious spin asymmetries, are also given.\n", "  We compute the right top quark coupling in the aligned two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel. In the Standard Model the real part of this coupling is dominated by\nQCD-gluon-exchange diagram, but the imaginary part, instead, is purely\nelectroweak at one loop. Within this model we show that values for the\nimaginary part of the coupling up to one order of magnitude larger than the\nelectroweak prediction can be obtained. For the real part of the electroweak\ncontribution we find that it can be up to three orders of magnitude larger than\nthe standard model one. We also present detailed results of the one loop\nanalytical computation.\n", "  The research deals with a study of local fractality in spatial distribution\nof forest fires in Portugal using the sandbox method. The general procedure is\nthe following: (a) define a circle centred in each and all events with\nincreasing radius R; (b) count the number of other events located within the\ncircle of radius R, N(R); (c) plot the growth curve which is the functional\ndependence of N(R) versus R; and (d) estimate the local fractal dimension as\nthe slope on log[N(R)] versus log[R]. The computation is carried out by using\nthe location of every fire event as a centre but without the final averaging\nover all the fires for a given R, which is usually performed to get a global\nfractal dimension and to estimate global clustering. Sandbox method is widely\nused in many applications in physics and other subjects. The local procedure\nhas the ability to provide the most complete information regarding the spatial\ndistribution of clustering and avoiding non-homogeneity and non-stationarity\nproblems. Most of the analysis was performed using the National Mapping Burnt\nArea (NMBA) database which accounts for 32,156 fires during the 1975 - 2013\nperiod. The results of local analysis are compared with a randomly generated\npattern in forest zones (validity domain). The results demonstrate interesting\nlocal spatial patterns of clustering. Some results on global measures are\nreported as well.\n", "  The basic shape of di-pion mass spectra in the two-pion transitions of both\ncharmonia and bottomonia states is explained by an unified mechanism based on\ncontributions of the $\\pi\\pi$, $K\\overline{K}$ and $\\eta\\eta$ coupled channels\nincluding their interference. The role of the individual $f_0$ resonances in\nshaping the di-pion mass distributions in the charmonia and bottomonia decays\nis considered.\n", "  Fixed node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) has been performed on a test set of\nforward and reverse barrier heights for 19 non-hydrogen-transfer reactions, and\nthe nodal error has been assessed. The DMC results are robust to changes in the\nnodal surface, as assessed by using different mean-field techniques to generate\nsingle determinant wave functions. Using these single determinant nodal\nsurfaces, DMC results in errors of 1.5(5) kcal/mol on barrier heights. Using\nthe large data set of DMC energies, we attempted to find good descriptors of\nthe fixed node error. It does not correlate with a number of descriptors\nincluding change in density, but does correlate with the gap between the\nhighest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbital energies in the mean-field\ncalculation.\n", "  We describe a density-, momentum-, and energy-conserving discretization of\nthe nonlinear Landau collision integral. The method is suitable for both the\nfinite-element and discontinuous Galerkin methods and does not require\nstructured meshes. The conservation laws for the discretization are proven\nalgebraically and demonstrated numerically for an axially symmetric nonlinear\nrelaxation problem using a finite-element implementation.\n", "  The announcement by the IceCube Collaboration of the observation of 53\nastrophysical neutrino candidates in the energy range 0.03 \\alt E_\\nu/PeV \\alt\n2 has been greeted with a great deal of justified excitement. Herein we provide\nfits of single and a broken power-law energy-spectra to these high-energy\nstarting events (HESEs). By comparing our statistical results from fits to\n(background-free) shower HESE data with the spectral shape of muon neutrinos\nrecently reported by the IceCube Collaboration, we show that there is (3\n\\sigma) evidence for a break in the spectrum of astrophysical neutrinos. After\nthat we use the fitted result to predict the rate of Glashow events (in the ~\n6.3 PeV region) and double-bang tau neutrino events (in the PeV region) just at\nthe threshold of IceCube detection.\n", "  Many models of physics beyond Standard Model predict the existence of light\nHiggs states, dark photons, and new gauge bosons mediating interactions between\ndark sectors and the Standard Model. Using a full data sample collected with\nthe BABAR detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ collider, we report searches for a\nlight non-Standard Model Higgs boson, dark photon, and a new muonic dark force\nmediated by a gauge boson ($Z'$) coupling only to the second and third lepton\nfamilies. Our results significantly improve upon the current bounds and further\nconstrain the remaining region of the allowed parameter space.\n", "  The effects of a correlated linear energy/velocity chirp in the electron beam\nin the FEL, and how to compensate for its effects by using an appropriate taper\n(or reverse-taper) of the undulator magnetic field, is well known. The theory,\nas described thus far, ignores velocity dispersion from the chirp in the\nundulator, taking the limit of a `small' chirp. In the following, the physics\nof compensating for chirp in the beam is revisited, including the effects of\nvelocity dispersion, or beam compression or decompression, in the undulator. It\nis found that the limit of negligible velocity dispersion in the undulator is\ndifferent from that previously identified as the small chirp limit, and is more\nsignificant than previously considered. The velocity dispersion requires a\ntaper which is non-linear to properly compensate for the effects of the\ndetuning, and also results in a varying peak current (end thus a varying gain\nlength) over the length of the undulator. The results may be especially\nsignificant for plasma driven FELs and low energy linac driven FEL test\nfacilities.\n", "  We show that, starting from known exact classical solutions of the Yang-Mills\ntheory in three dimensions, the string tension is obtained and the potential is\nconsistent with a marginally confining theory. The potential we obtain agrees\nfairly well with preceding findings in literature but here we derive it\nanalytically from the theory without further assumptions. The string tension is\nin strict agreement with lattice results and the well-known theoretical result\nby Karabali-Kim-Nair analysis. Classical solutions depend on a dimensionless\nnumerical factor arising from integration. This factor enters into the\ndetermination of the spectrum and has been arbitrarily introduced in some\ntheoretical models. We derive it directly from the solutions of the theory and\nis now fully justified. The agreement obtained with the lattice results for the\nground state of the theory is well below 1% at any value of the degree of the\ngroup.\n", "  We calculate the cross sections for both electromagnetic and diffractive\ndissociation of protons for semiexclusive production of $J/\\psi$ mesons in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC. Several differential distributions in\nmissing mass ($M_X$), or single-particle variables related exclusively to the\n$J/\\psi$ meson are calculated for $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV as an example. The cross\nsections and distributions are compared to the cross section of the purely\nexclusive reaction $p p \\to p p J/\\psi$. We show the corresponding ratio as a\nfunction of $J/\\psi$ meson rapidity. We compare the distributions for purely\nelectromagnetic and purely diffractive proton excitations/dissociation. We\npredict cross sections for electromagnetic and diffractive excitations of\nsimilar order of magnitude.\n", "  In tokamak transport barriers, the radial scale of profile variations can be\ncomparable to a typical ion orbit width, which makes the coupling of the\ndistribution function across flux surfaces important in the collisional\ndynamics. We use the radially global steady-state neoclassical {\\delta}f code\nPerfect to calculate poloidal and toroidal flows, and radial fluxes, in the\npedestal. In particular, we have studied the changes in these quantities as the\nplasma composition is changed from a deuterium bulk species with a helium\nimpurity to a helium bulk with a deuterium impurity, under specific profile\nsimilarity assumptions. The poloidally resolved radial fluxes are not\ndivergence-free in isolation in the presence of sharp radial profile\nvariations, which leads to the appearance of poloidal return-flows. These flows\nexhibit a complex radial-poloidal structure that extends several orbit widths\ninto the core and is sensitive to abrupt radial changes in the ion temperature\ngradient. We find that a sizable neoclassical toroidal angular momentum\ntransport can arise in the radially global theory, in contrast to the local.\n", "  We numerically compute the flow induced in a spherical shell by fixing the\nouter sphere and rotating the inner one. The aspect ratio\n$\\epsilon=(r_o-r_i)/r_i$ is set at 0.04 and 0.02, and in each case the Reynolds\nnumber measuring the inner sphere's rotation rate is increased to $\\sim10\\%$\nbeyond the first bifurcation from the basic state flow. For $\\epsilon =0.04$\nthe initial bifurcations are the same as in previous numerical work at\n$\\epsilon=0.154$, and result in steady one- and two-vortex states. Further\nbifurcations yield travelling wave solutions similar to previous analytic\nresults valid in the $\\epsilon\\to0$ limit. For $\\epsilon=0.02$ the steady\none-vortex state no longer exists, and the first bifurcation is directly to\nthese travelling wave solutions, consisting of pulse trains of Taylor vortices\ntravelling toward the equator from both hemispheres, and annihilating there in\ndistinct phase-slip events. We explore these time-dependent solutions in\ndetail, and find that they can be both equatorially symmetric and asymmetric,\nas well as periodic or quasi-periodic in time.\n", "  In this article, we investigate explosive bond percolation (EBP) with product\nrule, formally known as Achlioptas process, on a scale-free multifractal\nweighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL). One of the key features of the EBP\ntransition is the delay, compared to corresponding random bond percolation\n(RBP), in the onset of spanning cluster. However, when it happens, it happens\nso dramatically that initially it was believed, albeit ultimately proved wrong,\nthat explosive percolation (EP) exhibits first order transition. In the case of\nEP, much efforts were devoted to resolving the issue of its order of transition\nand almost no effort being devoted to find critical point, critical exponents\netc., to classify it into universality classes. This is in sharp contrast to\nthe classical random percolation. We do not even know all the exponents of EP\nfor regular planar lattice or for Erd\\\"{o}s-Renyi network. We first find\nnumerically the critical point $p_c$ and then obtain all the critical exponents\n$\\beta, \\gamma, \\nu$ as well as the Fisher exponent $\\tau$ and the fractal\ndimension $d_f$ of the spanning cluster. We also compare our results for EBP\nwith those of the RBP and find that all the exponents of EBP obeys the same\nscaling relations as do the RBP. Our findings suggests that EBP is no special\nexcept the fact that the exponent $\\beta$ is unusually small compared to that\nof RBP.\n", "  The chemical modification of graphene with adatoms is of importance for\nnanoelectronics applications. Based on first-principles density-functional\ntheory calculations with including van der Waals interactions, we present a\ncomparative study of the diffusion characteristics of oxygen (O) and fluorine\n(F) atoms both on graphene and between the layers of bilayer graphene. We find\nthat O and F atoms have lower binding energies between the layers of bilayer\ngraphene compared to on graphene. Interestingly, the calculated diffusion\nbarrier for the O atom slightly increases from 0.81 eV on graphene to 0.85 eV\nwithin bilayer graphene, while that for the F atom significantly decreases from\n0.30 eV on graphene to 0.18 eV within bilayer graphene. Such contrasting\nbehaviors of the O and F diffusions within bilayer graphene can be traced to\ntheir different bonding natures: i.e., the O adatom that has a strongly\ncovalent C$-$O$-$C bonding on the bridge site of the C$-$C bond diffuses on one\ngraphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer, while the F\nadatom that has a weakly ionic F$-$C bonding on top of a C atom easily diffuses\nby hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges\nfrom the two layers. The present findings have important implications for\nunderstanding the diffusion processes of F and O atoms on graphene and within\nbilayer graphene.\n", "  Due to its unique structure, graphene provides a condensed-matter model of\nparticle physics phenomena. One is the critical charge which is highly\ninterested. The investigation of critical charge in gapped graphene is\nperformed within single particle approach by means of Dirac equation\nintegration. The screened Coulomb interaction between charged defect and\ngraphene electron excitations is investigated. Two kinds of mass gap generation\nand various values of substrate dielectric permittivities are considered. It is\nshown that the critical charge phenomenon can be observed even with quite small\ncharges for physically motivated parameters.\n", "  We give a complete proposal showing how to detect the non-classical nature of\nphotonic states with naked eyes as detectors. The enabling technology is a\nsub-Poissonian photonic state that is obtained from single photons,\ndisplacement operations in phase space and basic non-photon-number-resolving\ndetectors. We present a detailed statistical analysis of our proposal including\nimperfect photon creation and detection and a realistic model of the human eye.\nWe conclude that a few tens of hours are sufficient to certify non-classical\nlight with the human eye with a p-value of 10%.\n", "  Top-quark pair production at the LHC is directly sensitive to the gluon PDF\nat large x. While total cross-section data is already included in several PDF\ndeterminations, differential distributions are not, because the corresponding\nNNLO calculations have become available only recently. In this work we study\nthe impact on the large-x gluon of top-quark pair differential distributions\nmeasured by ATLAS and CMS at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. Our analysis, performed in the\nNNPDF3.0 framework at NNLO accuracy, allows us to identify the optimal\ncombination of LHC top-quark pair measurements that maximize the constraints on\nthe gluon, as well as to assess the compatibility between ATLAS and CMS data.\nWe find that differential distributions from top-quark pair production provide\nsignificant constraints on the large-x gluon, comparable to those obtained from\ninclusive jet production data, and thus should become an important ingredient\nfor the next generation of global PDF fits.\n", "  We develop a computational framework to examine the factors responsible for\nscattering-induced distortions of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS)\nsignals in turbid samples. We apply the Huygens-Fresnel Wave-based Electric\nField Superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipole\napproximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focal\nexcitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect of\nspherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARS\nsignal emitted by different objects (2{\\mu}m diameter solid sphere, 2{\\mu}m\ndiameter myelin cylinder and 2{\\mu}m diameter myelin tube). We find that\ndistortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focal\nfield but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase that\nmodifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations further\nshow that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numerical\naperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS images\nformed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarized\ninput fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers.\nOur computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizing\nscattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and may\ninspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.\n", "  The representations of a compound, called \"descriptors\" or \"features\", play\nan essential role in constructing a machine-learning model of its physical\nproperties. In this study, we adopt a procedure for generating a systematic set\nof descriptors from simple elemental and structural representations. First it\nis applied to a large dataset composed of the cohesive energy for about 18000\ncompounds computed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. As a result,\nwe obtain a kernel ridge prediction model with a prediction error of 0.041\neV/atom, which is close to the \"chemical accuracy\" of 1 kcal/mol (0.043\neV/atom). The procedure is also applied to two smaller datasets, i.e., a\ndataset of the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) for 110 compounds computed by\nDFT calculation and a dataset of the experimental melting temperature for 248\ncompounds. We examine the performance of the descriptor sets on the efficiency\nof Bayesian optimization in addition to the accuracy of the kernel ridge\nregression models. They exhibit good predictive performances.\n", "  We study the tuning of U(1) gauge fields in F-theory models on a base of\ngeneral dimension. We construct a formula that computes the change in\nWeierstrass moduli when such a U(1) is tuned, based on the Morrison-Park form\nof a Weierstrass model with an additional rational section. Using this formula,\nwe propose the form of \"minimal tuning\" on any base, which corresponds to the\ncase where the decrease in the number of Weierstrass moduli is minimal.\nApplying this result, we discover some universal features of bases with\nnon-Higgsable U(1)s. Mathematically, a generic elliptic fibration over such a\nbase has additional rational sections. Physically, this condition implies the\nexistence of U(1) gauge group in the low-energy supergravity theory after\ncompactification that cannot be Higgsed away. In particular, we show that the\nelliptic Calabi-Yau manifold over such a base has a small number of complex\nstructure moduli. We also suggest that non-Higgsable U(1)s can never appear on\nany toric bases. Finally, we construct the first example of a threefold base\nwith non-Higgsable U(1)s.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics in a disordered electronic lattice with\nFibonacci sequence of site energy and off-diagonal electron-phonon coupling\nwithin a sub-Ohmic bath by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization\ngroup algorithm. It is found that, the slope of the inverse participation ratio\nversus the coupling strength undergoes a sudden change indicating a transition\nfrom the static to the dynamic localization. In the dynamic localization\nregime, the generated polarons coherently diffuse via hopping-like processes\nevidenced by the saturated entanglement entropy, providing a novel scenario for\nthe transportation mechanism in strongly disordered systems. The mean-square\ndisplacement is revealed to be insensitive to the coupling strength, implying\nthe quantum diffusion behavior survives the energy disorder that prevails in\nreal organic materials.\n", "  We develop a new algorithm for the Brownian dynamics of soft matter systems\nthat evolves time by spatially correlated Monte Carlo moves. The algorithm uses\nvector wavelets as its basic moves and produces hydrodynamics in the low\nReynolds number regime propagated according to the Oseen tensor. When small\nmoves are removed the correlations closely approximate the Rotne-Prager tensor,\nitself widely used to correct for deficiencies in Oseen. We also include plane\nwave moves to provide the longest range correlations, which we detail for both\ninfinite and periodic systems. The computational cost of the algorithm scales\ncompetitively with the number of particles simulated, $N$, scaling as $N\\ln N$\nin homogeneous systems and as $N$ in dilute systems. In comparisons to\nestablished lattice Boltzmann and Brownian dynamics algorithms the wavelet\nmethod was found to be only a factor of order 1 times more expensive than the\ncheaper lattice Boltzmann algorithm in marginally semi-dilute simulations,\nwhile it is significantly faster than both algorithms at large $N$ in dilute\nsimulations. We also validate the algorithm by checking it reproduces the\ncorrect dynamics and equilibrium properties of simple single polymer systems,\nas well as verifying the effect of periodicity on the mobility tensor.\n", "  We present a new method for sampling stochastic displacements in Brownian\nDynamics (BD) simulations of colloidal scale particles. The method relies on a\nnew formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor,\nwhich guarantees that the real-space and wave-space contributions to the tensor\nare independently symmetric and positive-definite for all possible particle\nconfigurations. Brownian displacements are drawn from a superposition of two\nindependent samples: a wave-space (far-field or long-ranged) contribution,\ncomputed using techniques from fluctuating hydrodynamics and non-uniform Fast\nFourier Transforms; and a real-space (near-field or short-ranged) correction,\ncomputed using a Krylov subspace method. The combined computational complexity\nof drawing these two independent samples scales linearly with the number of\nparticles. The proposed method circumvents the super-linear scaling exhibited\nby all known iterative sampling methods applied directly to the RPY tensor that\nresults from the power law growth of the condition number of tensor with the\nnumber of particles. Calculations for hard sphere dispersions and colloidal\ngels are illustrated and used to explore the role of microstructure on\nperformance of the algorithm. In practice, the logarithmic part of the\npredicted scaling is not observed and the algorithm scales linearly for up to 4\nmillion particles, obtaining speed ups of over an order of magnitude over\nexisting iterative methods, and making the cost of computing Brownian\ndisplacements comparable the cost of computing deterministic displacements in\nBD simulations. A high-performance implementation employing non-uniform fast\nFourier transforms implemented on graphics processing units and integrated with\nthe software package HOOMD-blue is used for benchmarking.\n", "  We analyze the timelike supersymmetric solutions of minimal gauged\n5-dimensional supergravity for the case in which the K\\\"ahler base manifold\nadmits a holomorphic isometry and depends on two real functions satisfying a\nsimple second-order differential equation. Using this general form of the base\nspace, the equations satisfied by the building blocks of the solutions become\nof, at most, fourth degree and can be solved by simple polynomic ansatzs. In\nthis way we construct two 3-parameter families of solutions that contain almost\nall the timelike supersymmetric solutions of this theory with one angular\nmomentum known so far and a few more: the (singular) supersymmetric\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS solutions, the three exact supersymmetric solutions\ndescribing the three near-horizon geometries found by Gutowski and Reall, three\n1-parameter asymptotically-AdS$_{5}$ black-hole solutions with those three\nnear-horizon geometries (Gutowski and Reall's black hole being one of them),\nthree generalizations of the G\\\"odel universe and a few potentially homogenous\nsolutions. A key r\\^ole in finding these solutions is played by our ability to\nwrite AdS$_{5}$'s K\\\"ahler base space ($\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}}^{2}$ or\nSU$(1,2)/$U$(2)$) is three different, yet simple, forms associated to three\ndifferent isometries. Furthermore, our ansatz for the K\\\"ahler metric also\nallows us to study the dimensional compactification of the theory and its\nsolutions in a systematic way.\n", "  We discuss hadron-tomography studies for the nucleon and exotic hadrons by\nhigh-energy hadron reactions. First, the constituent-counting rule is explained\nfor determining internal quark configurations of exotic-hadron candidates by\nscaling properties of high-energy exclusive cross sections. Next, possibilities\nare discussed for investigating the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of\nthe nucleon and exotic hadrons at J-PARC. In particular, we study hadronic $2\n\\to 3$ process $p+p \\to N+\\pi+B$, exclusive Drell-Yan process, and\nexotic-hadron GPDs. For determining three-dimensional structure of unstable\nexotic hadrons, we consider $s$-$t$ crossed quantities of the GPDs called\ngeneralized distribution amplitudes (GDAs), which can be investigated at KEKB.\nWe explain possible studies of the GDAs by two-photon processes.\n", "  In this work the behavior of power corrections to Adler finction in operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) is studied, in particular the possible contribution of\noperator of dimension 2. The OPE terms of dimension 4 and 6 are taken into\naccount. Various experimental data on reactions of $e^+e^-$-annihilation to\npion channels ($\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $2\\pi^+2\\pi^-$, $\\pi^+\\pi^-2\\pi^0$,\n$3\\pi^+3\\pi^-$, $2\\pi^+2\\pi^-2\\pi^0$) are used. The high-precision fits of the\nexperimental data are obtained and used. The method based on Borel transform of\nAdler function is applied. It is shown that the contribution of operator of\ndimension 2 is negative being compatible to zero at three standard deviations\nlevel. The strong (anti)corellation between short string and local gluon\ncondensate is found.\n", "  Here we introduce and study a photonic analogue of the Kondo model. The model\nis defined as a far detuned regime of photonic scattering off a three-level\nemitter in a $\\Lambda$-type configuration coupled to a one-dimensional\ntransmission line with linear dispersion. We characterize this system by\nstudying the dynamics of a local system (emitter) driven by a coherent field\npulse as well as the first- and second-order correlation functions of the\nscattered light. Various polarization-dependent correlation effects including\nentanglement between the emitter and transmitted photons are quantified by the\npurity of the emitter's state. We also show that statistical properties of the\nscattered light are very sensitive to the polarization of the incoming coherent\npulse.\n", "  New approach to computation of canonical partition functions in $N_f=2$\nlattice QCD is presented. We compare results obtained by new method with\nresults obtained by known method of hopping parameter expansion. We observe\nagreement between two methods indicating validity of the new method. We use\nresults for the number density obtained in the confining and deconfining phases\nat imaginary chemical potential to determine the phase transition line at real\nchemical potential.\n", "  We present the perspective of using atom interferometry for gravitational\nwave (GW) detection in the mHz to about 10 Hz frequency band. We focus on\nlight-pulse atom interferometers which have been subject to intense\ndevelopments in the last 25 years. We calculate the effect of the GW on the\natom interferometer and present in details the atomic gradiometer configuration\nwhich has retained more attention recently. The principle of such a detector is\nto use free falling atoms to measure the phase of a laser, which is modified by\nthe GW. We highlight the potential benefits of using atom interferometry\ncompared to optical interferometry as well as the challenges which remain for\nthe realization of an atom interferometry based GW detector. We present some of\nthe important noise sources which are expected in such detectors and strategies\nto cirucumvent them. Experimental techniques related to cold atom\ninterferometers are briefly explained. We finally present the current progress\nand projects in this rapidly evolving field.\n", "  3-D printing moves beyond interactive 3-D graphics and provides an excellent\ntool for both visual and tactile learners, since 3-D printing can now easily\ncommunicate complex geometries and full color information. Some limitations of\ninteractive 3-D graphics are also alleviated by 3-D printable models, including\nissues of limited software support, portability, accessibility, and\nsustainability. We describe the motivations, methods, and results of our work\non using 3-D printing (1) to visualize and understand the Eta Car Homunculus\nnebula and central binary system and (2) for astronomy outreach and education,\nspecifically, with visually impaired students. One new result we present is the\nability to 3-D print full-color models of Eta Car's colliding stellar winds. We\nalso demonstrate how 3-D printing has helped us communicate our improved\nunderstanding of the detailed structure of Eta Car's Homunculus nebula and\ncentral binary colliding stellar winds, and their links to each other. Attached\nto this article are full-color 3-D printable files of both a red-blue\nHomunculus model and the Eta Car colliding stellar winds at orbital phase\n1.045. 3-D printing could prove to be vital to how astronomer's reach out and\nshare their work with each other, the public, and new audiences.\n", "  Alkylsilane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as model\nsubstrates for their ease of preparation and hydrophobic properties. We have\nobserved that these atomically smooth monolayers also provide a slip boundary\ncondition for dewetting films composed of unentangled polymers. This slip\nlength, an indirect measure of the friction between a given liquid and\ndifferent solids, is switchable and can be increased [Fetzer et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 2005; B\\\"aumchen et al. J. Phys.: Cond. Matt. 2012] if the alkyl chain\nlength is changed from 18 to 12 backbone carbons, for example. Typically, this\nchange in boundary condition is affected in a quantized way, using one or the\nother alkyl chain length, thus obtaining one or the other slip length. Here, we\npresent results in which this SAM structure is changed in a continuous way. We\nprepare SAMs containing bidisperse mixed SAMs of alkyl silanes, with the\ncomposition as a control parameter. We find that all the mixed SAMs we\ninvestigated show an enhanced slip boundary condition as compared to the\nsingle-component SAMs. The slip boundary condition is accessed using optical\nand atomic force microscopy, and we describe these observations in the context\nof X-ray reflectivity measurements. The slip length, varying over nearly two\norders of magnitude, of identical polymer melts on chemically similar SAMs is\nfound to correlate with the density of exposed alkyl chains. Our results\ndemonstrate the importance of a well characterized solid/liquid pair, down to\nthe angstrom level, when discussing friction between a liquid and a solid.\n", "  Petabytes of data are to be processed and stored requiring millions of\nCPU-years in high energy particle (HEP) physics event simulation. This enormous\ndemand is handled in worldwide distributed computing centers as part of the LHC\ncomputing grid. These significant resources require a high quality and\nefficient production and the early detection of potential errors. In this\narticle we present novel monitoring techniques in a Grid environment to collect\nquality measures during job execution. This allows online assessment of data\nquality information to avoid configuration errors or inappropriate settings of\nsimulation parameters and therefore is able to save time and resources.\n", "  I shall recall in historical perspective some results from nineties and show\nfurther how $\\kappa$-deformed symmetries and $\\kappa$-Minkowski space inspired\nDSR (Doubly of Deformed Special Relativity) approach proposed after 2000. As\nvery recent development I shall show how to describe quantum-covariant\n$\\kappa$-deformed phase spaces by passing from Hopf algebras to Hopf algebroids\n(arXiv:1507.02612) and I will briefly describe the $\\kappa$-deformations of\n$AdS_5 \\times S^5$ superstring target spaces (arXiv:1510.030.83).\n", "  This is a critical discussion of physical relevance of some space-time\ncharacteristics which are in current use in high energy physics.\n", "  Nanocrystalline Al-Mg alloys are used to isolate the effect of grain boundary\ndoping on the strength of nanostructured metals. Mg is added during mechanical\nmilling, followed by low homologous temperature annealing treatments to induce\nsegregation without grain growth. Nanocrystalline Al -7 at.% Mg that is\nannealed for 1 h at 200 {\\deg}C is the strongest alloy fabricated, with a\nhardness of 4.56 GPa or approximately three times that of pure nanocrystalline\nAl. Micropillar compression experiments indicate a yield strength of 865 MPa\nand a specific strength of 329 kN m/kg, making this one of the strongest\nlightweight metals reported to date.\n", "  In a recent work [Baudin and Kristensen, J. Chem. Phys. 144, 224106 (2016)],\nwe introduced a local framework for calculating excitation energies (LoFEx),\nbased on second-order approximated coupled cluster (CC2) linear-response\ntheory. LoFEx is a black-box method in which a reduced excitation orbital space\n(XOS) is optimized to provide coupled cluster (CC) excitation energies at a\nreduced computational cost. In this article, we present an extension of the\nLoFEx algorithm to the calculation of CC2 oscillator strengths. Two different\nstrategies are suggested, in which the size of the XOS is determined based on\nthe excitation energy or the oscillator strength of the targeted transitions.\nThe two strategies are applied to a set of medium-sized organic molecules in\norder to assess both the accuracy and the computational cost of the methods.\nThe results show that CC2 excitation energies and oscillator strengths can be\ncalculated at a reduced computational cost, provided that the targeted\ntransitions are local compared to the size of the molecule. To illustrate the\npotential of LoFEx for large molecules, both strategies have been successfully\napplied to the lowest transition of the bivalirudin molecule (4255 basis\nfunctions) and compared with time-dependent density functional theory.\n", "  We consider the transverse-momentum distribution of a Higgs boson produced\nthrough gluon fusion in hadron collisions. At small transverse momenta, the\nlarge logarithmic terms are resummed up to next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL)\naccuracy. The resummed computation is consistently matched to the\nnext-to-leading-order (NLO) result valid at large transverse momenta. The\nensuing Standard Model prediction is supplemented by possible new-physics\neffects parametrised through three dimension-six operators related to the\nmodification of the top and bottom Yukawa couplings, and to the inclusion of a\npoint-like Higgs-gluon coupling, respectively. We present resummed\ntransverse-momentum spectra including the effect of these operators at NLL+NLO\naccuracy and study their impact on the shape of the distribution. We find that\nsuch modifications, while affecting the total rate within the current\nuncertainties, can lead to significant distortions of the spectrum. The proper\nparametrization of such effects becomes increasingly important for experimental\nanalyses in Run II of the LHC.\n", "  We study experimentally the oscillations of a non stationary transient signal\nof a semiconductor microcavity with embedded InGaAs quantum wells. The\noscillations occur as a result of quantum beats between the upper and lower\npolariton modes due to the strong exciton-photon coupling in the microcavity\nsample (Rabi oscillations). The registration of spectrally resolved signal has\nallowed for separate observation of oscillations at the eigenfrequencies of two\npolariton modes. Surprisingly, the observed oscillations measured at the lower\nand upper polariton modes have opposite phases. We demonstrate theoretically\nthat the opposite-phase oscillations are caused by the pump-induced\nmodification of polariton Hopfield coefficients, which govern the ratio of\nexciton and photon components in each of the polartion modes. Such a behaviour\nis a fundamental feature of the quantum beats of coupled light-matter states.\nIn contrast, the reference pump-probe experiment performed for the pure\nexcitonic states in a quantum well heterostructure with no microcavity revealed\nthe in-phase oscillations of the pump-probe signals measured at different\nexcitonic levels.\n", "  Flavor-twisted boundary conditions can be used for exponential reduction of\nfinite volume artifacts in flavor-averaged observables in lattice QCD\ncalculations with $SU(N_f)$ light quark flavor symmetry. Finite volume artifact\nreduction arises from destructive interference effects in a manner closely\nrelated to the phase averaging which leads to large $N_c$ volume independence.\nWith a particular choice of flavor-twisted boundary conditions, finite volume\nartifacts for flavor-singlet observables in a hypercubic spacetime volume are\nreduced to the size of finite volume artifacts in a spacetime volume with\nperiodic boundary conditions that is four times larger.\n", "  The $N$-jettiness observable $\\mathcal{T}_N$ provides a way of describing the\nleading singular behavior of the $N$-jet cross section in the $\\tau\n=\\mathcal{T}_N/Q \\to 0$ limit, where $Q$ is a hard interaction scale. We\nconsider subleading power corrections in the $\\tau \\ll 1$ expansion, and employ\nsoft-collinear effective theory to obtain analytic results for the dominant\n$\\alpha_s \\tau \\ln\\tau$ and $\\alpha_s^2 \\tau\\ln^3\\tau$ subleading terms for\nthrust in $e^+e^-$ collisions and $0$-jettiness for $q\\bar q$-initiated\nDrell-Yan-like processes at hadron colliders. These results can be used to\nsignificantly improve the numerical accuracy and stability of the $N$-jettiness\nsubtraction technique for performing fixed-order calculations at NLO and NNLO.\nThey reduce the size of missing power corrections in the subtractions by an\norder of magnitude. We also point out that the precise definition of\n$N$-jettiness has an important impact on the size of the power corrections and\nthus the numerical accuracy of the subtractions. The sometimes employed\ndefinition of $N$-jettiness in the hadronic center-of-mass frame suffers from\npower corrections that grow exponentially with rapidity, causing the power\nexpansion to deteriorate away from central rapidity. This degradation does not\noccur for the original $N$-jettiness definition, which explicitly accounts for\nthe boost of the Born process relative to the frame of the hadronic collision,\nand has a well-behaved power expansion throughout the entire phase space.\nIntegrated over rapidity, using this $N$-jettiness definition in the\nsubtractions yields another order of magnitude improvement compared to\nemploying the hadronic-frame definition.\n", "  We develop efficient numerical methods for performing many-body Brownian\ndynamics simulations of a recently-observed fingering instability in an active\nsuspension of colloidal rollers sedimented above a wall [M. Driscoll, B.\nDelmotte, M. Youssef, S. Sacanna, A. Donev and P. Chaikin, Nature Physics,\n2016, doi:10.1038/nphys3970]. We present a stochastic Adams-Bashforth\nintegrator for the equations of Brownian dynamics, which has the same cost as\nbut is more accurate than the widely-used Euler-Maruyama scheme, and uses a\nrandom finite difference to capture the stochastic drift proportional to the\ndivergence of the configuration-dependent mobility matrix. We generate the\nBrownian increments using a Krylov method, and show that for particles confined\nto remain in the vicinity of a no-slip wall by gravity or active flows the\nnumber of iterations is independent of the number of particles. Our numerical\nexperiments with active rollers show that the thermal fluctuations set the\ncharacteristic height of the colloids above the wall, both in the initial\ncondition and the subsequent evolution dominated by active flows. The\ncharacteristic height in turn controls the timescale and wavelength for the\ndevelopment of the fingering instability.\n", "  We study the AC electrical conductivity at zero temperature in a holographic\nmodel for a Weyl semimetal. At small frequencies we observe a linear dependence\nin the frequency. The model shows a quantum phase transition between a\ntopological semimetal (Weyl semimetal phase) with a non vanishing anomalous\nHall conductivity and a trivial semimetal. The AC conductivity has an\nintermediate scaling due to the presence of a quantum critical region in the\nphase diagram of the system. The phase diagram is reconstructed using the\nscaling properties of the conductivity. We compare with the experimental data\nof [1502.03807] obtaining qualitative agreement.\n", "  A rigorous description of volume and surface spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion in 1D nonlinear layered structures is developed considering\nexact continuity relations for the fields' amplitudes at the boundaries. The\nnonlinear process is described by the quantum momentum operator that provides\nthe Heisenberg equations which solution is continuous at the boundaries. The\ntransfer-matrix formalism is applied. The volume and surface contributions are\nclearly identified. Numerical analysis of a structure composed of 20\nalternating GaN/AlN layers is given as an example.\n", "  Measuring the clustering of galaxies from surveys allows us to estimate the\npower spectrum of matter density fluctuations, thus constraining cosmological\nmodels. This requires careful modelling of observational effects to avoid\nmisinterpretation of data. In particular, signals coming from different\ndistances encode information from different epochs. This is known as\n\"light-cone effect\" and is going to have a higher impact as upcoming galaxy\nsurveys probe larger redshift ranges. Generalising the method by Feldman et al.\n(1994), I define a minimum-variance estimator of the linear power spectrum at a\nfixed time, properly taking into account the light-cone effect. An analytic\nexpression for the estimator is provided, and that is consistent with the\nfindings of previous works in the literature. I test the method within the\ncontext of the halo model, assuming Planck 2014 cosmological parameters. I show\nthat the estimator presented recovers the fiducial linear power spectrum at\npresent time within 5% accuracy up to $k \\sim 0.80\\;h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and\nwithin 10% up to $k \\sim 0.94\\;h\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, well into the non-linear\nregime of the growth of density perturbations. As such, the method could be\nuseful in the analysis of the data from future large-scale surveys, like\nEuclid.\n", "  We have investigated large single crystals of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ that were grown\nfrom a levitating melt by the Czochralski method. The new samples facilitate\nthe determination of the absolute values of the electrical resistivity. Phase\npure polycrystalline samples of the non-magnetic reference LuNi$_4$P$_2$ were\nprepared and the electrical resistivity was measured. Furthermore we have grown\na single crystal of the As substituted compound YbNi$_4$(P$_{1-{\\it\nx}}$As$_{\\it x}$)$_2$, $x = 0.2$ and investigated the homogenity of the As\ndistribution.\n", "  We investigate symmetry breaking in two-dimensional field theories which have\na holographic gravity dual. Being at large N, the Coleman theorem does not hold\nand Goldstone bosons are expected. We consider the minimal setup to describe a\nconserved current and a charged operator, and we perform holographic\nrenormalization in order to find the correct Ward identities describing\nsymmetry breaking. This involves some subtleties related to the different\nboundary conditions that a vector can have in the three-dimensional bulk. We\nestablish which is the correct prescription that yields, after renormalization,\nthe same Ward identities as in higher dimensions.\n", "  We compute the thermodynamic properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models\nof fermions with a conserved fermion number, $\\mathcal{Q}$. We extend a\npreviously proposed Schwarzian effective action to include a phase field, and\nthis describes the low temperature energy and $\\mathcal{Q}$ fluctuations. We\nobtain higher-dimensional generalizations of the SYK models which display\ndisordered metallic states without quasiparticle excitations, and we deduce\ntheir thermoelectric transport coefficients. We also examine the corresponding\nproperties of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories on black brane geometries which\ninterpolate from either AdS$_4$ or AdS$_5$ to an AdS$_2\\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ or\nAdS$_2\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$ near-horizon geometry. These provide holographic\ndescriptions of non-quasiparticle metallic states without momentum\nconservation. We find a precise match between low temperature transport and\nthermodynamics of the SYK and holographic models. In both models the Seebeck\ntransport coefficient is exactly equal to the $\\mathcal{Q}$-derivative of the\nentropy. For the SYK models, quantum chaos, as characterized by the butterfly\nvelocity and the Lyapunov rate, universally determines the thermal diffusivity,\nbut not the charge diffusivity.\n", "  We present a general solution to the problem of determining all S-dual\ndescriptions for a specific (but very rich) class of $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ SCFTs.\nThese SCFTs are indexed by decorated toric diagrams, and can be engineered in\nstring theory by probing orientifolds of isolated toric singularities with D3\nbranes. The S-dual phases are described by quiver gauge theories coupled to\nspecific types of conformal matter which we describe explicitly. We illustrate\nour construction with many examples, including S-dualities in previously\nunknown SCFTs.\n", "  We present new limits on exotic keV-scale physics based on 478 kg d of\nMAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR commissioning data. Constraints at the 90% confidence\nlevel are derived on bosonic dark matter (DM) and solar axion couplings, Pauli\nexclusion principle violating (PEPV) decay, and electron decay using\nmonoenergetic peak signal-limits above our background. Our most stringent DM\nconstraints are set for 11.8 keV mass particles, limiting $g_{Ae} <4.5\\times\n10^{-13}$ for pseudoscalars and $\\frac{\\alpha'}{\\alpha} < 9.7\\times 10^{-28}$\nfor vectors. We also report a 14.4 keV solar axion coupling limit of\n$g_{AN}^{\\mathrm{eff}}\\times g_{Ae}~<~3.8 \\times 10^{-17}$, a\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\beta^2~<~8.5\\times10^{-48}$ limit on the strength of PEPV electron\ntransitions, and a lower limit on the electron lifetime of $\\tau_e > 1.2 \\times\n10^{24}\\;$yr for $e^- \\rightarrow$ invisible.\n", "  In this article, we consider the possibility of manipulation of quantum\nsignals, ensured by the use of the tripod-type atomic memory cell. We show that\ndepending on a configuration of driving fields at the writing and reading, such\na cell allows both to store and transform the signal. It is possible to provide\nthe operation of the memory cell in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer mode passing\ntwo successive pulses at the input. We proposed a procedure of partial signal\nread out that provides entanglement between the retrieved light and the atomic\nensemble. Thus, we have shown that tripod atomic cell is a promising candidate\nto implement of quantum logical operations, including two-qubit ones, that can\nbe performed on the basis of only one cell.\n", "  The authors considered the bulk viscous fluid in $f(R, T)$ gravity within the\nframework of Kaluza-Klein space time. The bulk viscous coefficient $(\\xi)$\nexpressed as $\\xi=\\xi_0+\\xi_1\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}+\\xi_2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}$,\nwhere $\\xi_0$, $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ are positive constants. We take\n$p=(\\gamma-1)\\rho$, where $0\\le\\gamma\\le2$ as an equation of state for perfect\nfluid. The exact solutions to the corresponding field equations are given by\nassuming a particular model of the form of $f(R, T)=R+2f(T)$, where\n$f(T)=\\lambda T$, $\\lambda$ is constant. We studied the cosmological model in\ntwo stages, in first stage: we studied the model with no viscosity, and in\nsecond stage: we studied the model involve with viscosity. The cosmological\nmodel involve with viscosity is studied by five possible scenarios for bulk\nviscous fluid coefficient $(\\xi)$. The total bulk viscous coefficient seems to\nbe negative, when the bulk viscous coefficient is proportional to\n$\\xi_2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}$, hence the second law of thermodynamics is not\nvalid, however, it is valid with the generalized second law of thermodynamics.\nThe total bulk viscous coefficient seems to be positive, when, the bulk viscous\ncoefficient is proportional to $\\xi=\\xi_1\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}$,\n$\\xi=\\xi_1\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}+\\xi_2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}$ and\n$\\xi=\\xi_0+\\xi_1\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}+\\xi_2\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{\\dot{a}}$, so the second\nlaw of thermodynamics and the generalized second law of thermodynamics is\nsatisfied throughout the evolution. We calculate statefinder parameters of the\nmodel and observed that, it is different from the $\\wedge$CDM model. Finally,\nsome physical and geometrical properties of the models are discussed.\n", "  We show the first results for the elastic scattering of neutrons off oxygen\nand calcium isotopes obtained from ab initio optical potentials. The potential\nis derived using self consistent Green's function theory (SCGF) with the\nsaturating chiral interaction NNLO$_{\\textrm{sat}}$. Our calculations are\ncompared to available scattering data and show that it is possible to reproduce\nlow energy scattering observables in medium mass nuclei from first principles.\n", "  We initiate the bootstrap program for $\\mathcal{N}=3$ superconformal field\ntheories (SCFTs) in four dimensions. The problem is considered from two fronts:\nthe protected subsector described by a $2d$ chiral algebra, and crossing\nsymmetry for half-BPS operators whose superconformal primaries parametrize the\nCoulomb branch of $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theories. With the goal of describing a\nprotected subsector of a family of $\\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFTs, we propose a new $2d$\nchiral algebra with super Virasoro symmetry that depends on an arbitrary\nparameter, identified with the central charge of the theory. Turning to the\ncrossing equations, we work out the superconformal block expansion and apply\nstandard numerical bootstrap techniques in order to constrain the CFT data. We\nobtain bounds valid for any theory but also, thanks to input from the chiral\nalgebra results, we are able to exclude solutions with $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nsupersymmetry, allowing us to zoom in on a specific $\\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFT.\n", "  We propose a new approach to determining quasi parton distribution functions\n(PDFs) from lattice quantum chromodynamics. By incorporating the gradient flow,\nthis method guarantees that the lattice quasi PDFs are finite in the continuum\nlimit and evades the thorny, and as yet unresolved, issue of the\nrenormalization of quasi PDFs on the lattice. In the limit that the flow time\nis much smaller than the length scale set by the nucleon momentum, the moments\nof the smeared quasi PDF are proportional to those of the light-front PDF. We\nuse this relation to derive evolution equations for the matching kernel that\nrelates the smeared quasi PDF and the light-front PDF. As part of this\ndiscussion, we elucidate the relationship between the quasi and light-front\nPDFs.\n", "  We study turbulent channel flow of a binary mixture of finite-size\nneutrally-buoyant rigid particles by means of interface-resolved direct\nnumerical simulations. We fix the bulk Reynolds number and total solid volume\nfraction, $Re_b = 5600$ and $\\Phi=20\\%$, and vary the relative fraction of\nsmall and large particles. The binary mixture consists of particles of two\ndifferent sizes, $2h/d_l=20$ and $2h/d_s=30$ where $h$ is the half channel\nheight and $d_l$ and $d_s$ the diameter of the large and small particles. While\nthe particulate flow statistics exhibit a significant alteration of the mean\nvelocity profile and turbulent fluctuations with respect to the unladen flow,\nthe differences between the mono-disperse and bi-disperse cases are small.\nHowever, we observe a clear segregation of small particles at the wall in\nbinary mixtures, which affects the dynamics of the near wall region and thus\nthe overall drag. This results in a higher drag in suspensions with a larger\namount of large particles. As regards bi-disperse effects on the particle\ndynamics, a non-monotonic variation of the particle dispersion in the spanwise\n(homogeneous) direction is observed when increasing the percentage of\nsmall/large particles. Finally, we note that particles of the same size tend to\ncluster more at contact whereas the dynamics of the large particles gives\nhighest collision kernels due to a higher approaching speed.\n", "  We study to what extent upcoming precision neutrino oscillation experiments\nwill be able to exclude one of the most predictive models of neutrino mass and\nmixing: the Littlest Seesaw. We show that this model provides a good fit to\ncurrent data, predicting eight observables from two input parameters, and\nprovide new assessments of its predictions and their correlations. We then\nassess the ability to exclude this model using simulations of upcoming neutrino\noscillation experiments including the medium-distance reactor experiments JUNO\nand RENO-50 and the long-baseline accelerator experiments DUNE and T2HK. We\nfind that an accurate determination of the currently least well measured\nparameters, namely the atmospheric and solar angles and the CP phase $\\delta$,\nprovide crucial independent tests of the model. For $\\theta_{13}$ and the two\nmass-squared differences, however, the model's exclusion requires a combination\nof measurements coming from a varied experimental programme. Our results show\nthat the synergy and complementarity of future experiments will play a vital\nrole in efficiently discriminating between predictive models of neutrino\nflavour, and hence, towards advancing our understanding of neutrino\noscillations in the context of the flavour puzzle of the Standard Model.\n", "  We consider the generalized quantum Rabi model with the so-called\n$A^{2}$-term in the light of the Hepp-Lieb-Preparata quantum phase transition.\nWe investigate the dressed photon in its ground state when the atom-light\ncoupling strength is in the deep-strong coupling regime. We show how the\ndressed photon appears in the ground state. We dedicate this paper to Pavel\nExner and Herbert Spohn on the occasion of their 70th birthdays, and Klaus Hepp\non the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n", "  The efficient way to transfer input potential energy to the kinetic energy of\na racket or bat was analyzed by two coupled harmonic triple pendulums. We find\nthe most efficient way to transfer energy based on the kinetic chain process.\nUsing control parameters, such as the release times, lengths and masses of the\ntriple pendulum, we optimize the kinetic chain process. We also introduce a new\nmethod to get an efficient way to transfer initial energy to the kinetic energy\nof the third rod in the triple pendulum without time delay, which is considered\nan essential part of a kinetic chain process.\n", "  We consider discrete stochastic processes, modeled by classical master\nequations, on networks. The temporal growth of the lack of information about\nthe system is captured by its non-equilibrium entropy, defined via the\ntransition probabilities between different nodes of the network. We derive a\nrelation between the entropy and the spectrum of the master equation's transfer\nmatrix. Our findings indicate that the temporal growth of the entropy is\nproportional to the logarithm of time if the spectral density shows scaling. In\nanalogy to chaos theory, the proportionality factor is called (stochastic)\ninformation dimension and gives a global characterization of the dynamics on\nthe network. These general results are corroborated by examples of regular and\nof fractal networks.\n", "  The excited leptons that share the quantum numbers with the Standard Model\nleptons but have larger masses are widespread in many promising new physics\ntheories. A subclass of excited leptons that at low energies interact with the\nSM fermions dominantly through the effective coupling to lepton and\nfermion-antifermion pair can be referred as leptomesons. I introduce possible\ngeneration of the baryon asymmetry of the universe using these new particles.\nThe discussed baryogenesis mechanisms do not contradict to the small neutrino\nmasses and the proton stability, and can be interesting for the collider\nexperiments.\n", "  Exact solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged particle in the\npresence of three spatially varying electromagnetic fields, namely, (i)\n$\\vec{E}=\\alpha\\beta_0e^{-\\alpha x_2}\\hat{x}_2$,\n$\\vec{B}=\\alpha\\beta_1e^{-\\alpha x_2}\\hat{x}_3$ (ii)\n$\\vec{E}=\\frac{\\beta_0^{'}}{x_2^2}\\hat{x}_2$,\n$\\vec{B}=\\frac{\\beta_1^{'}}{x_2^2}\\hat{x}_3$, and (iii)\n$\\vec{E}=\\frac{2\\beta_0^{'}}{x_2^3}\\hat{x}_2$,\n$\\vec{B}=\\frac{2\\beta_1^{'}}{x_2^3}\\hat{x}_3$, are studied. All these fields\nare generated from a systematic study of a particular type of differential\nequation whose coefficients are linear in independent variable. The Laplace\ntransform approach is used to find the solutions and the corresponding\neigenfunctions are expressed in terms of the hypergeometric functions\n$\\,_{1}F_{1}(a', b'; x)$ for first two cases of the above configurations while\nthe same are expressed in terms of the Bessel functions of first kind,\n$J_{n}(x)$, for the last case\n", "  In this work, we establish a correspondence between the interacting\nholographic, new agegraphic dark energy and generalized Chaplygin gas model in\nBianchi type I universe. In continue, we reconstruct the potential of the\nscalar field which describes the generalized Chaplygin cosmology. Cosmological\nsolutions are obtained when the kinetic energy of the phantom field is order of\nthe anisotropy and dominates over the potential energy of the field. We\ninvestigate observational constraints on the generalized Chaplygin gas,\nholographic and new agegraphic dark energy models as the unification of dark\nmatter and dark energy, by using the latest observational data. To do this we\nfocus on observational determinations of the expansion history $H(z)$. It is\nshown that the HDE model is better than the NADE and generalized Chaplygin gas\nmodels in an anisotropic universe. Then, we calculate the evolution of density\nperturbations in the linear regime for three models of dark energy and compare\nthe results $\\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, the analysis shows that the increase\nin anisotropy leads to more correspondence between the dark energy scalar field\nmodel and observational data\n", "  We study the dynamics of a few-quantum-particle cloud in the presence of two-\nand three-body interactions in weakly disordered one-dimensional lattices. The\ninteraction is dramatically enhancing the Anderson localization length $\\xi_1$\nof noninteracting particles. We launch compact wave packets and show that\nfew-body interactions lead to transient subdiffusion of wave packets, $m_2 \\sim\nt^{\\alpha}$, $\\alpha<1$, on length scales beyond $\\xi_1$. The subdiffusion\nexponent is independent of the number of particles. Two-body interactions yield\n$\\alpha\\approx0.5$ for two and three particles, while three-body interactions\ndecrease it to $\\alpha\\approx0.2$. The tails of expanding wave packets exhibit\nexponential localization with a slowly decreasing exponent. We relate our\nresults to subdiffusion in nonlinear random lattices, and to results on\nrestricted diffusion in high-dimensional spaces like e.g. on comb lattices.\n", "  We investigate entanglement and coherence in an $XXZ$ spin-$s$ pair immersed\nin a non-uniform transverse magnetic field. The ground state and thermal\nentanglement phase diagrams are analyzed in detail in both the ferromagnetic\nand antiferromagnetic cases. It is shown that a non-uniform field enables to\ncontrol the energy levels and the entanglement of the corresponding\neigenstates, making it possible to entangle the system for any value of the\nexchange couplings, both at zero and finite temperatures. Moreover, the limit\ntemperature for entanglement is shown to depend only on the difference\n$|h_1-h_2|$ between the fields applied at each spin, leading for $T>0$ to a\nseparability stripe in the $(h_1,h_2)$ field plane such that the system becomes\nentangled above a threshold value of $|h_1-h_2|$. These results are\ndemonstrated to be rigorously valid for any spin $s$. On the other hand, the\nrelative entropy of coherence in the standard basis, which coincides with the\nground state entanglement entropy at $T=0$ for any $s$, becomes non-zero for\nany value of the fields at $T>0$, decreasing uniformly for sufficiently high\n$T$. A special critical point arising at $T=0$ for non-uniform fields in the\nferromagnetic case is also discussed\n", "  Domain model of QCD allows for description of wide range of meson\nobservables, dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, and resolution of $U_A(1)$ and\nstrong $CP$ problems. The purpose of the present study is transition\nform-factor of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, and how they are influenced by the\ntypical vacuum configurations of the model -- almost everywhere homogeneous\nAbelian (anti-)self-dual fields. Asymptotic behavior of the calculated pion\nform-factor supports Belle trend, but the asymptotic value of\n$Q^2F_{\\pi\\gamma^*\\gamma}$ differs from the prediction of factorization\ntheorems.\n", "  Few compounds feature ice-shaping properties. The only compound reported to\nhave ice-shaping properties similar to that of ice-shaping proteins,\nencountered in many organisms living at low temperature, is Zirconium Acetate.\nWhen a Zirconium Acetate solution is frozen, oriented and perfectly hexagonal\nice crystals can be formed and their growth follows the temperature gradient.\nTo shed light on the water/ice phase transition while freezing Zirconium\nAcetate solution we carried out differential scanning calorimetry measurements.\nFrom our results, we estimate how many water molecules do not freeze because of\ntheir interaction with Zr cations. We estimate the colligative properties of\nthe Zr concentration on the apparent critical temperature. We further show the\nphase transition is unaffected by the nature of the base which is used to\nadjust the pH. Our results provide thus new hints on the ice-shaping mechanism\nof Zirconium Acetate.\n", "  The quantum spin $1/2$ XXZ chain with anisotropy parameter $\\Delta=-1/2$\npossesses a dynamic supersymmetry on the lattice. This supersymmetry and a\ngeneralisation to higher spin are investigated in the case of open spin chains.\nA family of non-diagonal boundary interactions that are compatible with the\nlattice supersymmetry and depend on several parameters is constructed. The\ncohomology of the corresponding supercharges is explicitly computed as a\nfunction of the parameters and the length of the chain. For certain specific\nvalues of the parameters, this cohomology is shown to be non-trivial. This\nimplies that the spin-chain ground states are supersymmetry singlets. Special\nscalar products involving an arbitrary number of these supersymmetry singlets\nfor chains of different lengths are exactly computed. As a physical\napplication, the logarithmic bipartite fidelity of the open quantum spin $1/2$\nXXZ chain with $\\Delta=-1/2$ and special diagonal boundary interactions is\ndetermined.\n", "  Local n-particle vertex functions represent the crucial ingredient for all\ndiagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Hitherto their\napplication has been restricted -with a few exceptions- to the n=2-particle\nvertex while higher-order vertices have been neglected. In this paper we derive\na general analytical expression for the n-particle (one-particle reducible)\nvertex of the Falicov-Kimball model (FKM). We observe that the magnitude of\nsuch vertex functions itself strongly increases with the particle-number n. On\nthe other hand, their effect on generic Feynman diagrams remains rather\nmoderate due to the damping effect of the Green's functions present in such\ndiagrams. Nevertheless, they yield important contributions to the self-energy\ncorrections calculated in diagrammatic extensions of DMFT as we explicitly\ndemonstrate using the example of dual fermion (DF) calculations for the\ntwo-dimensional FKM at quarter filling of stationary f-electrons where\ncorrections to the self-energy obtained from the three-particle vertex are\nindeed comparable in magnitude to corresponding corrections stemming from the\ntwo-particle vertex.\n", "  A translation of Paul Ehrenfest's 1933 paper, entitled \"Phase transitions in\nthe usual and generalized sense, classified according to the singularities of\nthe thermodynamic potential\" is presented. Some historical commentary about the\npaper's context is also given.\n", "  The set of equations describing nonlinear evolution of a single toroidal\nAlfven eigenmode are derived, including both zero frequency zonal structure\n(ZFZS) generation and wave-particle phase space nonlinearities. The simplified\ncase of neglecting wave-particle phase space nonlinearity is then investigated\nto focus on different roles of energetic particles and bulk plasmas on ZFZS\ngeneration. It is shown that energetic particles and bulk plasma play dominant\nroles in ZFZS generation in different nonlinear stages, and the corresponding\nprocesses are qualitatively different. Several properties of ZFZS generation,\ne.g., fine- vs. meso-scale, forced driven vs. spontaneous excitation, are\nclarified by the present analysis.\n", "  Three homologous C-class flares and one last M-class flare were observed by\nboth the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Hinode EUV Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) in the AR 11429 on March 9, 2012. All the recurrent flares\noccurred within a short interval of time (less than 4 hours), showed very\nsimilar plasma morphology and were all confined, until the last one when a\nlarge-scale eruption occurred. The C-class flares are characterized by the\nappearance, at approximatively the same locations, of two bright and compact\nfootpoint sources of $\\approx$~3--10~MK evaporating plasma, and a semi-circular\nribbon. During all the flares, the continuous brightening of a spine-like hot\nplasma ($\\approx$~10~MK) structure is also observed. Spectroscopic observations\nwith Hinode/EIS are used to measure and compare the blueshift velocities in the\n\\fexxiii\\ emission line and the electron number density at the flare footpoints\nfor each flare. Similar velocities, of the order of 150--200~km~s$^{-1}$, are\nobserved during the C2.0 and C4.7 confined flares, in agreement with the values\nreported by other authors in the study of the last M1.8 class flare. On the\nother hand, lower electron number densities and temperatures tend to be\nobserved in flares with lower peak soft X-ray flux.In order to investigate the\nhomologous nature of the flares, we performed a Non-Linear Force-Free Field\n(NLFFF) extrapolation of the 3D magnetic field configuration in the corona. The\nNLFFF extrapolation and the Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) provide the magnetic\nfield context which explains the location of the kernels, spine-like and\nsemi-circular brightenings observed in the (non-eruptive) flares. Given the\nabsence of a coronal null point, we argue that the homologous flares were all\ngenerated by the continuous recurrence of bald patch reconnection.\n", "  The quantum Otto cycle serves as a bridge between the macroscopic world of\nheat engines and the quantum regime of thermal devices composed from a single\nelement. We compile recent studies of the quantum Otto cycle with a harmonic\noscillator as a working medium. This model has the advantage that it is\nanalytically trackable. In addition, an experimental realization has been\nachieved employing a single ion in a harmonic trap. The review is embedded in\nthe field of quantum thermodynamics and quantum open systems. The basic\nprinciples of the theory are explained by a specific example illuminating the\nbasic definitions of work and heat. The relation between quantum observables\nand the state of the system is emphasized. The dynamical description of the\ncycle is based on a completely positive map formulated as a propagator for each\nstroke of the engine. Explicit solutions for these propagators are described on\na vector space of quantum thermodynamical observables. These solutions which\nemploy different assumptions and techniques are compared. The tradeoff between\npower and efficiency is the focal point of finite-time-thermodynamics. The\ndynamical model enables to study finite time cycles limiting time on the\nadiabtic and the thermalization times. Explicit finite time solutions are found\nwhich are frictionless, meaning that no coherence is generated also known as\nshortcuts to adiabaticity. The transition from frictionless to sudden adiabats\nis characterized by a non-hermitian degeneracy in the propagator. In addition\nthe influence of noise on the control is illustrated. These results are used to\nclose the cycles either as engines or as refrigerators.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate cross sections for charged-current\nneutrino-nucleus processes occuring under presupernova conditions. To treat\nthermal effects we extend self-consistent Skyrme-QRPA calculations to finite\ntemperature by using the formalism of thermo field dynamics. The numerical\nresults are presented for the sample nuclei, $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge\n", "  We present the results of a systematic study of the magnetic fields and other\nproperties of the Ap stars with resolved magnetically split lines. This study\nis based on new measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus, the mean\nlongitudinal magnetic field, the crossover, the mean quadratic magnetic field,\nand the radial velocity of 43 stars, complemented by magnetic data from the\nliterature for 41 additional stars. Stars with resolved magnetically split\nlines represent a significant fraction, of the order of several percent, of the\nwhole population of Ap stars. Most of them are genuine slow rotators, whose\nconsideration provides new insight into the long-period tail of the\ndistribution of the periods of the Ap stars. Emerging correlations between\nrotation periods and magnetic properties provide important clues for the\nunderstanding of the braking mechanisms that have been at play in the early\nstages of stellar evolution. The geometrical structures of the magnetic fields\nof Ap stars with magnetically resolved lines appear in general to depart\nslightly, but not extremely, from centred dipoles. However, there are a few\nremarkable exceptions, which deserve further consideration. We suggest that\npulsational crossover can be observed in some stars; if confirmed, this would\nopen the door to the study of non-radial pulsation modes of degree $\\ell$ too\nhigh for photometric or spectroscopic observations. How the lack of short\norbital periods among binaries containing an Ap component with magnetically\nresolved lines is related with their (extremely) slow rotation remains to be\nfully understood, but the very existence of acorrelation between the two\nperiods lends support to the merger scenario for the origin of Ap stars.\n", "  The ground and first excited states of the decuplet baryons are studied using\nthe two-point QCD sum rule approach. The mass and residue of these states are\ncomputed and compared with the existing experimental data and other theoretical\npredictions. The results for the masses of the ground state particles as well\nas the excited $ \\Delta $ and $ \\Sigma^{*} $ states are in good consistency\nwith experimental data. Our results on the excited $ \\Xi^{*} $ and $ \\Omega^{-}\n$ states reveal that the experimentally poorly known $ \\Xi(1950) $ and $\n\\Omega^{-}(2250) $ can be assigned as the first excited states in $ \\Xi^{*} $\nand $ \\Omega^{-} $ channels, respectively.\n", "  We explore systems with a large number of fermionic degrees of freedom\nsubject to non-local interactions. We study both vector and matrix-like models\nwith quartic interactions. The exact thermal partition function is expressed in\nterms of an ordinary bosonic integral, which has an eigenvalue repulsion term\nin the matrix case. We calculate real time correlations at finite temperature\nand analyze the thermal phase structure. When possible, calculations are\nperformed in both the original Hilbert space as well as the bosonic picture,\nand the exact map between the two is explained. At large $N$, there is a phase\ntransition to a highly entropic high temperature phase from a low temperature\nlow entropy phase. Thermal two-point functions decay in time in the high\ntemperature phase.\n", "  In most of the models beyond the Standard Model, the top quark is expected to\nbe polarized when produced in the decay of some heavier particle, like the\ngluino or the stop. The polarization is constructed, in an experiment or in\nsimulations, through the distribution of top decay products. Here, we propose\nan estimator of top quark polarization that depends only on the kinematics of\nit's mother particle, apart from its decay couplings to top quarks, and is\ngiven in terms of the top polarization expected in the rest frame of the\ndecaying particle. This estimator allows one to estimate the top polarization\nwithout performing a full simulation. We find this estimator is independent of\nthe production angle of the mother, top decay angle (for unpolarized mother),\nand the spin of the mother particle. We study the quality of the estimator with\nfinite width of the mother particle via examples of gluinos and stops decaying\ninto top quark at LHC. We also point out how for the mass spectra of gluinos\nand top squarks currently expected in a `natural' scenario, the polarization of\nthe top quarks produced in the gluino decays can uniquely track the mixing\nangle in the stop sector.\n", "  Using the isomorphism\n$\\mathfrak{o}(3;\\mathbb{C})\\simeq\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{C})$ we develop a new\nsimple algebraic technique for complete classification of quantum deformations\n(the classical $r$-matrices) for real forms $\\mathfrak{o}(3)$ and\n$\\mathfrak{o}(2,1)$ of the complex Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{o}(3;\\mathbb{C})$ in\nterms of real forms of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{C})$: $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$,\n$\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{R})$. We prove that the $D=3$\nLorentz symmetry\n$\\mathfrak{o}(2,1)\\simeq\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)\\simeq\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{R})$\nhas three different Hopf-algebraic quantum deformations which are expressed in\nthe simplest way by two standard $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ and\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{R})$ $q$-analogs and by simple Jordanian\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{R})$ twist deformations. These quantizations are\npresented in terms of the quantum Cartan-Weyl generators for the quantized\nalgebras $\\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ and $\\mathfrak{sl}(2;\\mathbb{R})$ as well as in\nterms of quantum Cartesian generators for the quantized algebra\n$\\mathfrak{o}(2,1)$. Finaly, some applications of the deformed $D=3$ Lorentz\nsymmetry are mentioned.\n", "  Lattice networks with dissipative interactions are often employed to analyze\nmaterials with discrete micro- or meso-structures, or for a description of\nheterogeneous materials which can be modelled discretely. They are, however,\ncomputationally prohibitive for engineering-scale applications. The\n(variational) QuasiContinuum (QC) method is a concurrent multiscale approach\nthat reduces their computational cost by fully resolving the (dissipative)\nlattice network in small regions of interest while coarsening elsewhere. When\napplied to damageable lattices, moving crack tips can be captured by adaptive\nmesh refinement schemes, whereas fully-resolved trails in crack wakes can be\nremoved by mesh coarsening. In order to address crack propagation efficiently\nand accurately, we develop in this contribution the necessary generalizations\nof the variational QC methodology. First, a suitable definition of crack paths\nin discrete systems is introduced, which allows for their geometrical\nrepresentation in terms of the signed distance function. Second, special\nfunction enrichments based on the partition of unity concept are adopted, in\norder to capture kinematics in the wakes of crack tips. Third, a summation rule\nthat reflects the adopted enrichment functions with sufficient degree of\naccuracy is developed. Finally, as our standpoint is variational, we discuss\nimplications of the mesh refinement and coarsening from an energy-consistency\npoint of view. All theoretical considerations are demonstrated using two\nnumerical examples for which the resulting reaction forces, energy evolutions,\nand crack paths are compared to those of the direct numerical simulations.\n", "  We revisit the construction of multi-centered solutions in three-dimensional\nanti-de Sitter gravity in the light of the recently discovered connection\nbetween particle worldlines and classical Virasoro conformal blocks. We focus\non multi-centered solutions which represent the backreaction of point masses\nmoving on helical geodesics in global AdS$_3$, and argue that their\nconstruction reduces to a problem in Liouville theory on the disk with\nZamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov boundary condition. In order to construct the\nsolution one needs to solve a certain monodromy problem which we argue is\nsolved by a vacuum classical conformal block on the sphere in a particular\nchannel. In this way we construct multi-centered gravity solutions by using\nconformal blocks special functions. We show that our solutions represent\nleft-right asymmetric configurations of operator insertions in the dual CFT. We\nalso provide a check of our arguments in an example and comment on other types\nof solutions.\n", "  The non-monotonic beam energy dependence of the higher cumulants of\nnet-proton fluctuations is a widely studied signature of the conjectured\npresence of a critical point in the QCD phase diagram. In this work we study\nthe effect of resonance decays on critical fluctuations. We show that resonance\neffects reduce the signatures of critical fluctuations, but that for reasonable\nparameter choices critical effects in the net-proton cumulants survive. The\nrelative role of resonance decays has a weak dependence on the order of the\ncumulants studied with a slightly stronger suppression of critical effects for\nhigher-order cumulants.\n", "  One of the factors which may limit the intensity in the Fermilab Recycler is\na fast transverse instability. It develops within a hundred turns and, in\ncertain conditions, may lead to a beam loss. The high rate of the instability\nsuggest that its cause is electron cloud. We studied the phenomena by observing\nthe dynamics of stable and unstable beam, simulating numerically the build-up\nof the electron cloud, and developed an analytical model of an electron cloud\ndriven instability with the electrons trapped in combined function di-poles. We\nfound that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearing bunch, which confirms\nthe electron cloud nature of the instability. The clearing suggest electron\ncloud trapping in Recycler combined function mag-nets. Numerical simulations\nshow that up to 1% of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since\nthe process of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount\nof electrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next\nrevolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multi-turn accumulation\nallows the electron cloud reaching final intensities orders of magnitude\ngreater than in a pure dipole. The estimated resulting instability growth rate\nof about 30 revolutions and the mode fre-quency of 0.4 MHz are consistent with\nexperimental observations and agree with the simulation in the PEI code. The\ncreated instability model allows investigating the beam stability for the\nfuture intensity upgrades.\n", "  The neutron background spectrum from thermal neutron to 20 MeV fast neutron\nwas measured at the first experimental hall of China Jinping underground\nlaboratory with a Bonner multi-sphere spectrometer. The measurement system was\nvalidated by a Cf252 source and inconformity was corrected. Due to micro charge\ndischarge, the dataset was screened and background from the steel of the\ndetectors was estimated by MC simulation. Based on genetic algorithm we\nobtained the energy distribution of the neutron and the total flux of neutron\nwas (2.69 +/-1.02) *10^-5 cm^-2s^-1\n", "  A wealth of experimental data indicate that while capillarity controlled\ninfiltration gives an infiltration length that varies with the square root of\ntime, reactive infiltration is characterised by a linear relationship between\nthe two magnitudes. In addition the infiltration rate in the latter is at least\ntwo orders of magnitude greater than in the former.\n  This work is addressed to investigate imbibition of a non-wetting, albeit\nreactive, liquid into a capillary, within the framework of a simple model that\nincludes capillarity effects, viscosity and gravity. The capillary radius is\nallowed to vary, due to reaction, with both position and time, according to\neither an interface or a diffusion law. The model allows for capillary closure\nwhen reaction kinetics dominates imbibition. At short times, and depending on\nwhether infiltration is capillarity or gravity controlled, the infiltrated\nlength varies either as the square root or linearly with time. This suggest the\nfollowing track for reactive infiltration: i) In most cases, the contact angle\nis initially larger than $90^\\circ$, ii) after some time, reaction gradually\nreplaces the interface liquid/preform by the liquid/reaction product interface\nand, concomitantly, the contact angle gets closer to $90^\\circ$, iii) beyond\nthat time, gravity triggers infiltration (actually the contact angle does not\nneed to be smaller than $90^\\circ$ for the initiation of infiltration due to\nthe metallostatic pressure exerted by the liquid metal on top of the porous\npreform), iv) thereafter infiltration is controlled by viscosity and gravity,\nprovided that, due to reaction, the contact angle remains close to that at\nwhich infiltration was initiated.\n", "  This article presents a new numerical scheme for the discretization of\ndissipative particle dynamics with conserved energy. The key idea is to reduce\nelementary pairwise stochastic dynamics (either fluctuation/dissipation or\nthermal conduction) to effective single-variable dynamics, and to approximate\nthe solution of these dynamics with one step of a Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm. This ensures by construction that no negative internal energies are\nencountered during the simulation, and hence allows to increase the admissible\ntimesteps to integrate the dynamics, even for systems with small heat\ncapacities. Stability is only limited by the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics,\nwhich suggests resorting to multiple timestep strategies where the stochastic\npart is integrated less frequently than the Hamiltonian one.\n", "  Nuclear level densities and $\\gamma$-ray strength functions of $^{56,57}$Fe\nhave been extracted from proton-$\\gamma$ coincidences. A low-energy enhancement\nin the $\\gamma$-ray strength functions up to a factor of 30 over common\ntheoretical E1 models is confirmed. Angular distributions of the low-energy\nenhancement in $^{57}$Fe indicate its dipole nature, in agreement with findings\nfor $^{56}$Fe. The high statistics and the excellent energy resolution of the\nlarge-volume LaBr$_{3}$(Ce) detectors allowed for a thorough analysis of\n$\\gamma$ strength as function of excitation energy. Taking into account the\npresence of strong Porter-Thomas fluctuations, there is no indication of any\nsignificant excitation-energy dependence in the $\\gamma$-ray strength function,\nin support of the generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis.\n", "  Unlike Noether symmetry, a metric independent general conserved current exits\nfor non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor theory of gravity, if the trace of the\nenergy momentum tensor vanishes. Thus, in the context of cosmology, a symmetry\nexists both in the early vacuum and radiation dominated era. For slow roll,\nsymmetry is sacrificed, but at the end of early inflation, such a symmetry\nleads to a Friedmann-like radiation era. Late time cosmic acceleration in the\nmatter dominated era is realized in the absence of symmetry, in view of the\nsame decayed and red-shifted scalar field. Thus, unification of early inflation\nwith late time cosmic acceleration with a single scalar field, may be realized.\n", "  The most efficient weights for Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations of\nphysical observables are not necessarily those of the canonical ensemble.\nGeneralized ensembles, which do not exist in nature but can be simulated on\ncomputers, lead often to a much faster convergence. In particular, they have\nbeen used for simulations of first order phase transitions and for simulations\nof complex systems in which conflicting constraints lead to a rugged free\nenergy landscape. Starting off with the Metropolis algorithm and Hastings'\nextension, I present a mini review which focuses on the explosive use of\ngeneralized ensembles in the early 1990s. Illustrations are given, which range\nfrom spin models to peptides.\n", "  We investigate the soft behaviour of scalar effective field theories (EFTs)\nwhen there is a number of distinct derivative power counting parameters,\n$\\rho_1< \\rho_2<\\ldots < \\rho_Q$. We clarify the notion of an enhanced soft\nlimit and use these to extend the scope of on-shell recursion techniques for\nscalar EFTs. As an example, we perform a detailed study of theories with two\npower counting parameters, $\\rho_1=1$ and $\\rho_2=2$, that include the shift\nsymmetric generalised galileons. We demonstrate that the minimally enhanced\nsoft limit uniquely picks out the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) symmetry, including\nDBI galileons. For the exceptional soft limit we uniquely pick out the special\ngalileon within the class of theories under investigation. We study the DBI\ngalileon amplitudes more closely, verifying the validity of the recursion\ntechniques in generating the six point amplitude, and explicitly demonstrating\nthe invariance of all amplitudes under DBI galileon duality.\n", "  We compute the four-loop QCD corrections to the massless\nquark-anti-quark-photon form factor $F_q$ in the large-$N_c$ limit. From the\npole part we extract analytic expressions for the corresponding cusp and\ncollinear anomalous dimensions.\n", "  We introduce the technique combining the features of integration schemes for\nSDYM equations and multidimensional dispersionless integrable equations to get\nSDYM equations on the conformally self-dual background. Generating differential\nform is defined, the dressing scheme is developed. Some special cases and\nreductions are considered.\n", "  We discuss weak kaon decays in a scenario in which the Standard Model is\nextended by massive sterile fermions. After revisiting the analytical\nexpressions for leptonic and semileptonic decays we derive the expressions for\ndecay rates with two neutrinos in the final state. By using a simple effective\nmodel with only one sterile neutrino, compatible with all current experimental\nbounds and general theoretical constraints, we conduct a thorough numerical\nanalysis which reveals that the impact of the presence of massive sterile\nneutrinos on kaon weak decays is very small, less than $1\\%$ on decay rates.\nThe only exception is $\\mathcal{B} (K_L\\to \\nu\\nu)$, which can go up to\n$\\mathcal{O}( 10^{-10})$, thus possibly within the reach of the KOTO\nexperiment. In other words, if all the future measurements of weak kaon decays\nturn out to be compatible with the Standard Model predictions, this would not\nrule out the existence of massive light sterile neutrinos with non-negligible\nactive-sterile mixing. Instead, for a sterile neutrino of mass below $m_K$, one\nmight obtain a huge enhancement of $\\mathcal{B} (K_L\\to \\nu\\nu)$, otherwise\nnegligibly small in the Standard Model.\n", "  In both stars and in the early universe, the production of deuterium is the\nfirst step on the way to producing heavier nuclei. If the strong force were\nslightly weaker, deuterium would not be stable, and many authors have noted\nthat nuclesynthesis would be compromised so that helium production could not\nproceed through standard reaction chains. Motivated by the possibility that\nother regions of space-time could have different values for the fundamental\nconstants, this paper considers stellar evolution in universes without stable\ndeuterium and argues that such universes can remain habitable. Even in\nuniverses with no stellar nucleosynthesis, stars can form and will generate\nenergy through gravitational contraction. We show that such stars can be\nsufficiently luminous and long-lived to support life. Stars with initial masses\nthat exceed the Chandrasekhar mass cannot be supported by degeneracy pressure\nand explode at the end of their contraction phase. The resulting explosive\nnucleosynthesis can provide the universe with some heavy elements. We also\nexplore the possibility that helium can be produced in stellar cores through a\ntriple-nucleon reaction (roughly analogous to the triple-alpha reaction). Next\nwe show that with even trace amounts of heavy elements --- produced through the\ntriple-nucleon process or by explosive nucleosynthesis --- the CNO cycle can\noperate and allow stars to function. Finally, we consider Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis without stable deuterium and find that only trace amounts of\nhelium are produced, with even smaller abundances of other nuclei. With stars\nevolving through gravitational contraction, explosive nucleosynthesis, the\ntriple-nucleon reaction, and the CNO cycle, universes with no stable deuterium\nare thus potentially habitable, contrary to many previous claims.\n", "  The surface code is one of the most successful approaches to topological\nquantum error-correction. It boasts the smallest known syndrome extraction\ncircuits and correspondingly largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings\nof a new variety called twists have made it possible to implement the full\nClifford group without state distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based\nencoding involving a modified twist. In our modified formulation, the resulting\ncodes, called triangle codes for the shape of their planar layout, have only\nweight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that\nmaintain a high, near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25% fewer\nphysical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code. Moreover, benefiting\nfrom the twist, we can implement all Clifford gates by lattice surgery without\nthe need for state distillation. By a surgical transformation to the surface\ncode, we also develop a scheme of doing all Clifford gates on surface code\npatches in an atypical planar layout, though with less qubit efficiency than\nthe triangle code. Finally, we remark that logical qubits encoded in triangle\ncodes are naturally amenable to logical tomography, and the smallest triangle\ncode can demonstrate high-pseudothreshold fault-tolerance to depolarizing noise\nusing just 13 physical qubits.\n", "  The basis of leading operators which are not invariant under baryon number is\nconstructed within the Higgs Effective Field Theory. This list contains 12\ndimension six operators, which preserve the combination B-L, to be compared to\nonly 6 operators for the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. The discussion\non the independent flavour contractions is presented in detail for a generic\nnumber of fermion families adopting the Hilbert series technique.\n", "  LSST is expected to yield ~10^7 light curves over the course of its mission,\nwhich will require a concerted effort in automated classification. Stochastic\nprocesses provide one means of quantitatively describing variability with the\npotential advantage over simple light curve statistics that the parameters may\nbe physically meaningful. Here, we survey a large sample of periodic,\nquasi-periodic, and stochastic OGLE-III variables using the damped random walk\n(DRW, CARMA(1,0)) and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO, CARMA(2,1)) stochastic\nprocess models. The QPO model is described by an amplitude, a period, and a\ncoherence time-scale, while the DRW has only an amplitude and a time-scale. We\nfind that the periodic and quasi-periodic stellar variables are generally\nbetter described by a QPO than a DRW, while quasars are better described by the\nDRW model. There are ambiguities in interpreting the QPO coherence time due to\nnon-sinusoidal light curve shapes, signal-to-noise, error mischaracterizations,\nand cadence. Higher-order implementations of the QPO model that better capture\nlight curve shapes are necessary for the coherence time to have its implied\nphysical meaning. Independent of physical meaning, the extra parameter of the\nQPO model successfully distinguishes most of the classes of periodic and\nquasi-periodic variables we consider.\n", "  Astrophysical black hole candidates, although long thought to have a horizon,\ncould be horizonless ultra-compact objects. This intriguing possibility is\nmotivated by the black hole information paradox and a plausible fundamental\nconnection with quantum gravity. Asymptotically free quadratic gravity is\nconsidered here as the UV completion of general relativity. A classical theory\nthat captures its main features is used to search for solutions as sourced by\nmatter. We find that sufficiently dense matter produces a novel horizonless\nconfiguration, the 2-2-hole, which closely matches the exterior Schwarzschild\nsolution down to about a Planck proper length of the would-be horizon. The\n2-2-hole is characterized by an interior with a shrinking volume and a\nseemingly innocuous timelike curvature singularity. The interior also has a\nnovel scaling behavior with respect to the physical mass of the 2-2-hole. This\nleads to an extremely deep gravitational potential in which particles get\nefficiently trapped via collisions. As a generic static solution, the 2-2-hole\nmay then be the nearly black endpoint of gravitational collapse. There is a\nconsiderable time delay for external probes of the 2-2-hole interior, and this\ndetermines the spacing of echoes in a post-merger gravitational wave signal.\n", "  The spin-Seebeck effect refers to voltage signals induced in metals by\nthermally driven spin currents in adjacent magnetic systems. We present a\ntheory of the spin-Seebeck signal in the case where the conductor that supports\nthe voltage signal is the topologically protected two-dimensional surface-state\nsystem at the interface between a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a\ntopological insulator (TI). Our theory uses a Dirac model for the TI\nsurface-states and assumes Heisenberg exchange coupling between the TI\nquasiparticles and the FI magnetization. The spin-Seebeck voltage is induced by\nthe TI surface states scattering off the nonequilibrium magnon population at\nthe surface of the semi-infinite thermally driven FI. Our theory is readily\ngeneralized to spin-Seebeck voltages in any two-dimensional conductor that is\nexchange-coupled to the surface of a FI. Surface-state\ncarrier-density-dependent signal strengths calculated using Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and\nyttrium iron garnet material parameters are consistent with recent experiments.\n", "  We construct a low-temperature microwave waveguide interferometer for\nmeasuring high-frequency properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs).\nCoupled plasmon-cyclotron resonance (PCR) spectra are used to extract effective\nmass, bulk plasmon frequency, and carrier relaxation times. In contrast to\ntraditional transmission spectroscopy, this method does not require sample\npreparation and is nondestructive. PCR signals can be resolved with a microwave\npower source as low as 10 nW. We observe PCR in the multi-photon transition\nregime, which has been proposed to be relevant to the microwave-induced\nresistance oscillations.\n", "  We embed Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs) in the Froggatt Nielsen (FN)\nframework. We find that the approximate FN symmetry predicts i) approximate\nNatural Flavor Conservation (NFC) of Types II or IV in the Yukawa sector, and\nii) approximate Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry in the scalar sector. We discuss the\nphenomenological consequences of these features.\n", "  We present a microscopic model on radiation-induced zero resistance states\naccording to a novel approach: Franck-Condon physics and blockade. Zero\nresistance states rise up from radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations\nwhen the light intensity is strong enough. The theory starts off with the {\\it\nradiation-driven electron orbit model} that proposes an interplay of the\nswinging nature of the radiation-driven Landau states and the presence of\ncharged impurity scattering. When the intensity of radiation is high enough it\nturns out that the driven-Landau states (vibrational states) involved in the\nscattering process are spatially far from each other and the corresponding\nelectron wave functions do not longer overlap. As a result, it takes place a\ndrastic suppression of the scattering probability and then current and\nmagnetoresistance exponentially drop. Finally zero resistance states rise up.\nThis is an application to magnetotransport in two dimensional electron systems\nof the Franck-Condon blockade, based on the Franck-Condon physics which in turn\nstems from molecular vibrational spectroscopy.\n", "  We generalize a model of growth over a disordered environment, to a large\nclass of It\\=o processes. In particular, we study how the microscopic\nproperties of the noise influence the macroscopic growth rate. The present\nmodel can account for growth processes in large dimensions, and provides a bed\nto understand better the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. An\nadditional mapping to the Schr\\\"ordinger equation readily provides a set of\ndisorders for which this model can be solved exactly. This mean-field approach\nexhibits interesting features, such as a freezing transition and an optimal\npoint of growth, that can be studied in details, and gives yet another\nexplanation for the occurrence of the $\\textit{Zipf law}$ in complex,\nwell-connected systems.\n", "  We propose a new technique to measure the infrared scintillation light yield\nof rare earth (RE) doped crystals by comparing it to near UV-visible\nscintillation of a calibrated Pr:(Lu$_{0.75}$Y$_{0.25}$)$_{3}$Al$_5$O$_{12}$\nsample. As an example, we apply this technique to provide the light yield in\nvisible and infrared range up to \\SI{1700}{nm} of this crystal.\n", "  We theoretically propose a method for optical isolation based on adiabatic\nnonlinear sum frequency generation in a chirped quasi-phase-matching crystal\nwith strong absorption at the generated sum frequency wave. The method does not\nsuffer from limitations of dynamic reciprocity found in other nonlinear optical\nisolation methods, and can provide tunable optical isolation with ultrafast\nall-optical switching capability. Moreover, as an adiabatic technique it is\nrobust to variations in the optical design and is relatively broadband.\n", "  We present a quantum model which provides enhanced understanding of recent\ntransverse magnetic focusing experiments on graphene $p$-$n$ junctions.\nSpatially resolved flow maps of local particle current density show quantum\ninterference and $p$-$n$ junction filtering effects which are crucial to\nexplaining the device operation. The Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formula is used\nalongside dephasing edge contacts to give exceptional agreement between\nsimulated non-local resistance and the recent experiment by Chen $\\textit{et\nal}$ ($\\textit{Science}$, 2016). The origin of positive and negative focusing\nresonances and off resonance characteristics are explained in terms of quantum\ntransmission functions. Our model also captures subtle features from\nexperiment, such as the previously unexplained $p$-$p^-$ to $p$-$p^+$\ntransition and the second $p$-$n$ focusing resonance.\n", "  We report on a first NLO computation of photon production in p+A collisions\nat collider energies within the Color Glass Condensate framework, significantly\nextending previous LO results. At central rapidites, our result is the dominant\ncontribution and probes multi-gluon correlators in nuclei. At high photon\nmomenta, the result is directly sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution.\nThe NLO result contains two processes, the annihilation process and the process\nwith $q\\bar{q}$ pair and a photon in the final state. We provide a numerical\nevaluation of the photon spectrum from the annihilation process.\n", "  We study the effect of a Chern-Simons term on the electrically charged and\nspinning solitons of several $U(1)$ gauged models in $2+1$ dimensions. These\nare vortices of complex scalar field theories, both with and without symmetry\nbreaking dynamics, and the $O(3)$ Skyrme model. In all cases the gauge\ndecoupling limits are also considered. It is well known that the effect of the\nChern-Simons dynamics is to endow vortices with electric charge $Q_e$ and spin\n$J$, but our main aim here is to reveal a new feature: that the mass-energy $E$\nof the electrically charged vortex can be lower than that of the electrically\nneutral one, in contrast to the usual monotonic increase of $E$ with $Q_e$.\nThese effects of Chern-Simons dynamics were observed previously in $3+1$\ndimensional systems, and the present results can be viewed as corroborating the\nlatter. Moreover, the usual energy-spin relationship is likewise altered. We\ncarry out a detailed quantitative analysis of azimuthally symmetric vortices\nand describe their qualitative features by constructing the solutions\nnumerically.\n", "  In this paper I investigate the analytic properties of the quark propagator\nDyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) in the Landau gauge. In the quark self-energy,\nthe combined gluon propagator and quark-gluon vertex is modeled by an effective\ninteraction (the so-called Maris-Tandy interaction), where the ultraviolet term\nis neglected. This renders the loop integrand of the quark self-energy analytic\non the cut-plane -Pi < arg(x) < Pi of the square of the external momentum.\nExploiting the simplicity of the truncation, I study solutions of the quark\npropagator in the domain x in [-5.1,0] GeV^2 X i[0,10.2] GeV^2. Because of a\ncomplex conjugation symmetry, this region fully covers the parabolic\nintegration domain for Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSEs) for bound state masses\nof up to 4.5 GeV. Employing a novel numerical technique that is based on highly\nparallel computation on graphics processing units (GPUs), I extract more than\n6500 poles in this region, which arise as the bare quark mass is varied over a\nwide range of closely spaced values. The poles are grouped in 23 individual\n'trajectories', that capture the movement of the poles in the complex region as\nthe bare mass is varied. The raw data of the pole locations and -residues is\nprovided as supplemental material, which can be used to parametrize solutions\nof the complex quark propagator for a wide range of bare mass values and for\nlarge bound state masses. This study is a first step towards an extension of\nprevious work on the analytic continuation of perturbative one-loop integrals,\nwith the long-term goal of establishing a framework that allows for the\nnumerical extraction of the analytic properties of the quark propagator with a\ntruncation that extends beyond the rainbow by making adequate adjustments in\nthe contour of the radial integration of the quark self-energy.\n", "  Feasibility studies of the measurement of the exclusive diffractive\nbremsstrahlung cross-section in proton-proton scattering at the centre of mass\nenergy of 13 TeV at the LHC are reported. Present studies were performed for\nthe low luminosity LHC running with the betatron function value of 90~m using\nthe ATLAS associated forward detectors ALFA and ZDC. A simplified approach to\nthe event simulation and reconstruction is used. The background influence is\nalso discussed.\n", "  Monolayer (ML) transition-metal dichalcogenides exist in different phases,\nsuch as the hexagonal (2H) and distorted octahedral or monoclinic (1T') phases.\nThe different structures show vastly different properties. For example, the 2H\nMoTe2 ML is a direct-gap semiconductor while 1T' MoTe2 is a semi-metal. It has\nbeen suggested that the formation energies between 2H and 1T' MoTe2 differ very\nlittle, so there is a high chance to tune the structures of MoTe2 and thereby\nto bring in new applications such as phase-change electronics. In this work, we\nreport growth of both 2H and 1T' MoTe2 ML by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). We\ndemonstrate the tunability of the structural domains in epitaxial MoTe2 by\nchanging the growth conditions of MBE and by annealing. We present experimental\nand theoretical evidences showing the important role of Te surface adsorption\nin promoting and stabilizing the otherwise metastable 1T'-MoTe2 during MBE.\n", "  The investigation of dynamics of intense solitary wave groups of collinear\nsurface waves is performed by means of numerical simulations of the Euler\nequations and laboratory experiments. The processes of solitary wave\ngeneration, reflection from a wall and collisions are considered. Steep\nsolitary wave groups with characteristic steepness up to $kA_{cr} = 0.3$ (where\n$k$ is the dominant wavenumber, and $A_{cr}$ is the crest amplitude) are\nconcerned. They approximately restore the structure after all the considered\ninteractions. In the course of the interaction with the wall and collisions the\nmaximum amplitude of the wave crests is shown to enhance up to 2.5 times. A\nstanding-wave-like structure occurs in the vicinity of the wall, with certain\nlocations of nodes and antinodes regardless the particular phase of the\nreflecting wave group. A strong asymmetry of the maximal wave groups due to an\nanomalous set-up is shown in situations of collisions of solitons with\ndifferent frequencies of the carrier. In some situations of head-on collisions\nthe amplitude of the highest wave is larger than in over-head collisions of the\nsame solitons. The discovered effects in interactions of intense wave groups\nare important in the context of mechanisms and manifestations of oceanic rogue\nwaves.\n", "  In recent years, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) has been proposed as a\npromising solution in order to increase the information capacity of optical\nnetworks both in free-space and in optical fiber transmission. Here we present\nthe design, fabrication and test of diffractive optical elements for\nmode-division multiplexing based on optical transformations in the visible\nrange. Diffractive optics have been fabricated by means of 3D high-resolution\nelectron beam lithography on polymethylmethacrylate resist layer spun over a\nglass substrate. The same optical sequence was exploited both for input-mode\nmultiplexing and for mode sorting after free-space propagation. Their high\nminiaturization level and efficiency make these optical devices ideal for\nintegration into next-generation platforms for mode-division (de)multiplexing\nin telecom applications.\n", "  We consider the soft wall model for a heuristic holographical modelling of a\nconfining gauge theory and discuss how the introduction of a (constant)\nmagnetic field influences the (de)confinement phase structure. We use the\nentanglement entropy as a diagnostic tool in terms of the length of an\nentangling strip geometry. Due to the anisotropy introduced by the magnetic\nfield, we find that the results depend on the orientation of the strip relative\nto the field. This allows to identify a richer, anisotropic, interplay between\nconfinement and a magnetic field than possibly can be extracted from a more\nstandard order parameter as, for example, the Polyakov loop expectation value.\n", "  Recent data on the transverse single spin asymmetry $A_N$ measured by the\nSTAR Collaboration for $p^\\uparrow \\, p \\to W^\\pm/Z^0 \\, X$ reactions at RHIC\nallow the first investigation of the Sivers function in Drell-Yan processes and\nof its expected sign change with respect to SIDIS processes. A new extraction\nof the Sivers functions from the latest SIDIS data is performed and a critical\nassessment of the significance of the STAR data is attempted.\n", "  It is proposed to replace the traditional counterpropagating laser seed in\nbackward Raman amplifiers with a plasma wave seed. In the linear regime,\nnamely, for a constant pump amplitude, a plasma wave seed may be found by\nconstruction that strictly produces the same output pulse as does a\ncounterpropagating laser seed. In the nonlinear regime, or pump-depletion\nregime, the plasma-wave-initiated output pulse can be shown numerically to\napproach the same self-similar attractor solution for the corresponding laser\nseed. In addition, chirping the plasma wave wavelength can produce the same\nbeneficial effects as chirping the seed wave frequency. This methodology is\nattractive because it avoids issues in preparing and synchronizing a\nfrequency-shifted laser seed.\n", "  A degenerate sfermionic particle spectrum can escape constraints from flavor\nphysics, and at the same time evade the limits from the direct searches if the\ndegeneracy extends to the gaugino-higgsino sector. Inspired by this, we\nconsider a scenario where all the soft terms have an approximately common mass\nscale at $M_{\\text{SUSY}}$, with splittings $\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$. As a\nresult, the third generation sfermions have large to maximal (left-right)\nmixing, the same being the case with charginos and some sectors of the\nneutralino mass matrix. We study this scenario in the light of discovery of the\nHiggs boson with mass $\\sim$ 125 GeV. We consider constraints from $B$-physics,\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the dark matter relic density. We\nfind that a supersymmetric spectrum as light as 600 GeV could be consistent\nwith all current data and also account for the observed anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon within $2\\sigma$. The neutralino relic density is generally\ntoo small to saturate the measured cold dark matter relic density. Direct\ndetection limits from XENON100 and LUX put severe constraints on this scenario\nwhich will be conclusively probed by XENONnT experiment.\n", "  We consider a discrete scalar, quantum field theory based on a cubic\n4-dimensional lattice. We mainly investigate a discrete scattering operator\n$S(x_0,r)$ where $x_0$ and $r$ are positive integers representing time and\nmaximal total energy, respectively. The operator $S(x_0,r)$ is used to define\ntransition amplitudes which are then employed to compute transition\nprobabilities. These probabilities are conditioned on the time-energy\n$(x_0,r)$. In order to maintain total unit probability, the transition\nprobabilities need to be reconditioned at each $(x_0,r)$. This is roughly\nanalogous to renormalization in standard quantum field theory, except no\ninfinities or singularities are involved. We illustrate this theory with a\nsimple scattering experiment involving a common interaction Hamiltonian. We\nbriefly mention how discreteness of spacetime might be tested astronomically.\nMoreover, these tests may explain the existence of dark energy and dark matter.\n", "  Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) of fundamental particles provide\npowerful probes for physics beyond the Standard Model. We propose to search for\nthe EDM of strange and charm baryons at LHC, extending the ongoing experimental\nprogram on the neutron, muon, atoms, molecules and light nuclei. The EDM of\nstrange Lambda baryons, selected from weak decays of charm baryons produced in\npp collisions at LHC, can be determined by studying the spin precession in the\nmagnetic field of the detector tracking system. A test of CPT symmetry can be\nperformed by measuring the magnetic dipole moment of Lambda and anti-Lambda\nbaryons. For short-lived Lambdac+ and Xic+ baryons, to be produced in a\nfixed-target experiment using the 7 TeV LHC beam and channeled in a bent\ncrystal, the spin precession is induced by the intense electromagnetic field\nbetween crystal atomic planes. The experimental layout based on the LHCb\ndetector and the expected sensitivities in the coming years are discussed.\n", "  Aims: This work is the first stage of a campaign to search for IMBHs, in low\nluminosity AGN (LLAGN) and dwarf galaxies. An additional, and equally\nimportant, aim of this pilot study is to investigate the consistency between\nthe predictions of several BH scaling relations and the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity (FP-BH). Methods: We use X-ray and radio luminosity\nrelations in accreting BHs, along with the latest scaling relations between the\nmass of the central black hole (MBH) and the properties of its host spheroid,\nto predict MBH in seven LLAGN, that were previously reported to be in the IMBH\nregime. Namely, we use the recently re-evaluated MBH - Msph (Msph : spheroid\nabsolute magnitude at 3.6 microm) scaling relation for spiral galaxies, the MBH\n- nsph (nsph : major axis Sersic index of the bulge) relation, the MBH - PA\n(PA: pitch angle) relation and the FP-BH for weakly accreting BHs, to\nindependently estimate MBH in all seven galaxies. Results: We find that all\nLLAGN in our list have low-mass central black holes - with log MBH/Msol~6.5 on\naverage - but they are, not IMBHs. All 4 methods used predicted consistent BH\nmasses, in the 1sigma range. Furthermore, we report that, in contrast to\nprevious classification, galaxy NGC 4470 is bulge-less, and cast doubts on the\nAGN classification of NGC 3507. Conclusions: We find that our latest,\nstate-of-the-art techniques for bulge magnitude & Sersic index computations and\nthe most recent updates of the MBH - Lsph, MBH - nsph , MBH - PA relations and\nthe FP-BH produce consistent results in the low mass regime. We establish a\nmultiple method approach for predicting BH masses in the regime where their\nspheres-of- grav. influence cannot be spatially resolved. Our approach\nmitigates against outliers from any one relation and provides a more robust\naverage prediction. We will use our new method to revisit more IMBH candidates\nin LLAGN\n", "  We study non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum quenches in a recent\ngauge/gravity duality model for a strongly coupled system interacting with a\nmagnetic impurity with $SU(N)$ spin. At large $N$, it is convenient to write\nthe impurity spin as a bilinear in Abrikosov fermions. The model describes an\nRG flow triggered by the marginally relevant Kondo operator. There is a phase\ntransition at a critical temperature, below which an operator condenses which\ninvolves both an electron and an Abrikosov fermion field. This corresponds to a\nholographic superconductor in AdS$_2$ and models the impurity screening. We\nstudy the time dependence of the condensate induced by quenches of the Kondo\ncoupling. The timescale for equilibration is generically given by the\nlowest-lying quasinormal mode of the dual gravity model. This mode also governs\nthe formation of the screening cloud, which is obtained as the decrease of\nimpurity degrees of freedom with time. In the condensed phase, the leading\nquasinormal mode is imaginary and the relaxation of the condensate is\nover-damped. For quenches whose final state is close to the critical point of\nthe large $N$ phase transition, we study the critical slowing down and obtain\nthe combination of critical exponents $z\\nu=1$. When the final state is exactly\nat the phase transition, we find that the exponential ringing of the\nquasinormal modes is replaced by a power-law behaviour of the form $\\sim\nt^{-a}\\sin(b\\log t)$. This indicates the emergence of a discrete scale\ninvariance.\n", "  In a weak coupling limit the neighborhood of $E_6$ Yukawa points in $SU(5)$\nGUT F-theory models is described by a non-resolvable orientifold of the\nconifold. We explicitly show, first directly in IIB and then via a mirror\nsymmetry argument, that in this limit the $E_6$ Yukawa coupling is better\ndescribed as coming from the non-perturbative contribution of a euclidean\nD1-brane wrapping the non-resolvable cycle. We also discuss how the M-theory\ndescription interpolates between the weak and strong coupling viewpoints.\n", "  Timing analysis is a powerful tool used to determine periodic features of\nphysical phenomena. Here we review two applications of timing analysis to\ngravitational microlensing events. The first one, in particular cases, allows\nthe estimation of the orbital period of binary lenses, which in turn enables\nthe breaking of degeneracies. The second one is a method to measure the\nrotation period of the lensed star by observing signatures due to stellar spots\non its surface.\n", "  Planar AdS black holes with axionic charge have finite DC conductivity due to\nmomentum relaxation. We obtain a new family of exact asymptotically AdS$_4$\nblack branes with scalar hair, carrying magnetic and axion charge, and we study\nthe thermodynamics and dynamic stability of these, as well as of a number of\npreviously known electric and dyonic solutions with axion charge and scalar\nhair. The scalar hair for all solutions satisfy mixed boundary conditions,\nwhich lead to modified holographic Ward identities, conserved charges and free\nenergy, relative to those following from the more standard Dirichlet boundary\nconditions. We show that properly accounting for the scalar boundary conditions\nleads to well defined first law and other thermodynamic relations. Finally, we\ncompute the holographic quantum effective potential for the dual scalar\noperator and show that dynamical stability of the hairy black branes is\nequivalent to positivity of the energy density.\n", "  Both the radiation efficiency and bandwidth of electrically small antennas\nare dramatically reduced as the size decreases. Fundamental limitations on the\nbandwidth of small antennas have been thoroughly treated in the past. However,\nupper bounds on radiation efficiency have not been established even though it\nis also of significant importance. Here, radiation from a thin metallic shell\nis rigorously analyzed to establish fundamental limits on the radiation\nefficiency of resonant, electrically small antennas in terms of the size and\nthe metal conductivity. Metallic losses are systematically introduced into the\ncircuit model proposed by Chu, and several resonant antennas with maximum\nradiation efficiencies are analyzed. Resonant electric and magnetic dipole\nantennas both have maximum radiation efficiencies near 100% until the size is\nreduced below a critical value, at which point the efficiency scales as\nelectrical size to the fourth power ((ka)^4 ). It is also shown that a helix\nantenna that resonantly couples the TM10 mode to the TE10 mode has a maximum\nradiation efficiency, and is about twice that of a resonant dipole or loop\nantenna. The closed form expressions reported here provide valuable insight\ninto the design of small antennas with optimal efficiencies.\n", "  We study frustrated quantum spin systems consisting of dimers of spin-1/2\nspins. We derive several models that have the exact ground state of the form of\nthe direct product of dimer states. The ground states realized include the\nproduct state of dimer singlets, that of dimer triplets with zero\nmagnetization, those of dimer-spin-nematic states, and those of a mixture of\nthe dimer states. Pseudo spin-1/2 operators emerging in each dimer are also\nintroduced.\n", "  We discuss how one-dimensional interacting fermion systems, which in the low\nenergy approximation are described by Luttinger liquid theory, can be\nreformulated as systems of weakly interacting particles with fractional charge\nand statistics. Our approach is to use Landau's phenomenological approach to\nFermi liquid theory, where the quasiparticles are interpreted as adiabatically\ndressed fermions. In an earlier publication the local charge carried by these\nexcitations has been shown to be fractional. We focus here on the statistics of\nthe quasiparticles and show that by a change of momentum variables the Landau\nparameters of the generalized Fermi fluid can be transformed to zero. This\nchange in interaction is compensated by a change of the entropy function, which\nis consistent with the interpretation of the quasiparticles as satisfying\ngeneralized exclusion statistics.\n", "  In loop quantum cosmology, one has to make a choice of SU(2) irreducible\nrepresentation in which to compute holonomies and regularize the curvature of\nthe connection. The systematic choice made in the literature is to work in the\nfundamental representation, and very little is known about the physics\nassociated with higher spin labels. This constitutes an ambiguity whose\nunderstanding, we believe, is fundamental for connecting loop quantum cosmology\nto full theories of quantum gravity like loop quantum gravity, its spin foam\nformulation, or cosmological group field theory. We take a step in this\ndirection by providing here a new closed formula for the Hamiltonian of flat\nFLRW models regularized in a representation of arbitrary spin. This expression\nis furthermore polynomial in the basic variables which correspond to\nwell-defined operators in the quantum theory, takes into account the so-called\ninverse-volume corrections, and treats in a unified way two different\nregularization schemes for the curvature. After studying the effective\nclassical dynamics corresponding to single and multiple spin Hamiltonians, we\nstudy the behavior of the critical density when the number of representations\nis increased, and the stability of the difference equations in the quantum\ntheory.\n", "  Quantum Brownian motion of a rod-like particle is investigated in the frame\nwork of system plus reservoir model. The quantum mechanical and classical limit\nfor both translational and rotational motions are discussed. Correlation\nfunctions, fluctuation-dissipation relations and mean squared values of\ntranslational and rotational motions are obtained.\n", "  Featuring low heat dissipation, devices based on spin-wave logic gates\npromise to comply with increasing future requirements in information\nprocessing. In this work, we present the experimental realization of a majority\ngate based on the interference of spin waves in an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet-based\nwaveguiding structure. This logic device features a three-input combiner with\nthe logic information encoded in the phase of the spin waves. We show that the\nphase of the output signal represents the majority of the phase of the input\nsignals. A switching time of about 10 ns in the prototype device provides\nevidence for the ability of sub-nanosecond data processing in future\ndown-scaled devices.\n", "  The measurement of muon momentum by Multiple Coulomb Scattering is a crucial\ningredient to the reconstruction of {\\nu}{\\mu} CC events in the ICARUS-T600\nliquid argon TPC in absence of magnetic field, as in the search for sterile\nneutrinos at Fermilab where ICARUS will be exposed to ~1 GeV Booster neutrino\nbeam. A sample of ~1000 stopping muons produced by charged current interactions\nof CNGS {\\nu}{\\mu} in the surrounding rock at the INFN Gran Sasso underground\nLaboratory provides an ideal benchmark in the few-GeV range since their\nmomentum can be directly and independently obtained by the calorimetric\nmeasurement. Stopping muon momentum in the 0.5- 4.5 GeV/c range has been\nreconstructed via Multiple Coulomb Scattering with resolution ranging from 10\nto 25 % depending on muon energy, track length and uniformity of the electric\nfield in the drift volume.\n", "  We review a microscopic model of the nuclear parton distribution functions,\nwhich accounts for a number of nuclear effects including Fermi motion and\nnuclear binding, nuclear meson-exchange currents, off-shell corrections to\nbound nucleon distributions and nuclear shadowing. We also discuss applications\nof this model to a number of processes including lepton-nucleus deep inelastic\nscattering, proton-nucleus Drell-Yan lepton pair production at Fermilab, as\nwell as W+- and Z0 boson production in proton-lead collisions at the LHC.\n", "  A quantum superintegrable model with reflections on the $(n-1)$-sphere is\npresented. Its symmetry algebra is identified with the higher rank\ngeneralization of the Bannai-Ito algebra. It is shown that the Hamiltonian of\nthe system can be constructed from the tensor product of $n$ representations of\nthe superalgebra $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ and that the superintegrability is\nnaturally understood in that setting. The separated solutions are obtained\nthrough the Fischer decomposition and a Cauchy-Kovalevskaia extension theorem.\n", "  The Heavy Photon Search (HPS) is an experiment to search for a hidden sector\nphoton, aka a heavy photon or dark photon, in fixed target electroproduction at\nthe Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab). The HPS experiment\nsearches for the e$^+$e$^-$ decay of the heavy photon with bump hunt and\ndetached vertex strategies using a compact, large acceptance forward\nspectrometer, consisting of a silicon microstrip detector (SVT) for tracking\nand vertexing, and a PbWO$_4$ electromagnetic calorimeter for energy\nmeasurement and fast triggering. To achieve large acceptance and good vertexing\nresolution, the first layer of silicon detectors is placed just 10 cm\ndownstream of the target with the sensor edges only 500 $\\mu$m above and below\nthe beam. Placing the SVT in such close proximity to the beam puts stringent\nrequirements on the beam profile and beam position stability. As part of an\napproved engineering run, HPS took data in 2015 and 2016 at 1.05 GeV and 2.3\nGeV beam energies, respectively. This paper describes the beam line and its\nperformance during that data taking.\n", "  Local symmetries are spatial symmetries present in a subdomain of a complex\nsystem. By using and extending a framework of so-called non-local currents that\nhas been established recently, we show that one can gain knowledge about the\nstructure of eigenstates in locally symmetric setups through a Kirchhoff-type\nlaw for the non-local currents. The framework is applicable to all discrete\nplanar Schr\\\"odinger setups, including those with non-uniform connectivity.\nConditions for spatially constant non-local currents are derived and we explore\ntwo types of locally symmetric subsystems in detail, closed-loops and\none-dimensional open ended chains. We find these systems to support locally\nsimilar or even locally symmetric eigenstates.\n", "  Hypothetical oscillations of probe photons into axion-like particles might be\nrevealed by exploiting the strong fields of high-intensity laser pulses.\nConsidering an arbitrary plane-wave background, we determine the polarization\ntensor induced by the quantum fluctuations of the axion field and use it to\ncalculate how the polarimetric properties of an initially linear-polarized\nprobe beam are modified. We find that various experimental setups based on\ncontemporary facilities and instrumentation might lead to new exclusion bounds\non the parameter space of these particle candidates. The impact of the pulse\nshape on the discovery potential is studied via a comparison between the cases\nin which the wave is modulated by a Gaussian envelope and a $\\sin^2$ profile.\nThis analysis shows that the upper limits resulting from the ellipticity are\nrelatively insensitive to this change, whereas those arising from the rotation\nof the polarization plane turn out to be more dependent on the field shape.\n", "  We investigated current-voltage characteristics of unshunted and externally\nshunted Josephson junctions (JJs) with high critical current densities, Jc, in\norder to extract their basic parameters and statistical characteristics for JJ\nmodeling in superconducting integrated circuits and to assess their potential\nfor future technology nodes. Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb JJs with diameters from 0.5 {\\mu}m\nto 6 {\\mu}m were fabricated using a fully planarized process with Mo or MoNx\nthin-film shunt resistors with sheet resistance Rsq = 2 {\\Omega}/sq and Rsq = 6\n{\\Omega}/sq, respectively. We used our standard MIT LL process SFQ5ee to\nfabricate JJs with Jc = 0.1 mA/{\\mu}m^2 and our new process SFQ5hs to make JJs\nwith Jc = 0.2 mA/{\\mu}m^2 and higher current densities up to about 1\nmA/{\\mu}m^2. Using LRC resonance features on the I-V characteristics of shunted\nJJs, we extract the inductance associated with molybdenum shunt resistors of\n1.4 pH/sq. The main part this inductance, about 1.1 pH/sq, is the inductance of\nthe 40-nm Mo resistor film, while the geometrical inductance of superconducting\nNb wiring contributes the rest. We attribute this large inductance to kinetic\ninductance arising from the complex conductivity of a thin normal-metal film in\nan electromagnetic field with angular frequency {\\omega},\n{\\sigma}({\\omega})={\\sigma}0/(1+i{\\omega}{\\tau}), where {\\sigma}0 is the static\nconductivity and {\\tau} the electron scattering time. Using a resonance in a\nlarge-area unshunted high-Jc junction excited by a resistively coupled\nsmall-area shunted JJ, we extract the Josephson plasma frequency and specific\ncapacitance of high-Jc junctions in 0.1 to 1 mA/{\\mu}m^2 Jc range. We also\npresent data on Jc targeting and JJ critical current spreads. We discuss using\n0.2-mA/{\\mu}m^2 JJs in VLSI Single Flux Quantum circuits and 0.5-mA/{\\mu}m^2\nJJs in high-density integrated circuits without shunt resistors.\n", "  At low temperatures the dynamical degrees of freedom in amorphous solids are\ntunnelling two-level systems (TLSs). Concentrating on these degrees of freedom,\nand taking into account disorder and TLS-TLS interactions, we obtain a\n\"TLS-glass\", described by the random field Ising model with random $1/r^3$\ninteractions. In this paper we perform a self consistent mean field\ncalculation, previously used to study the electron-glass (EG) model [A.~Amir\n{\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 77}, 165207, (2008)]. Similar to the\nelectron-glass, we find $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ distribution of relaxation rates\n$\\lambda$, leading to logarithmic slow relaxation. However, with increased\ninteractions the EG model shows slower dynamics whereas the TLS glass model\nshows faster dynamics. This suggests that given system specific properties,\nglass dynamics can be slowed down or sped up by the interactions.\n", "  If massive neutrinos are the Majorana particles and have a normal mass\nordering, the effective mass term $\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}$ of a neutrinoless\ndouble-beta ($0\\nu 2\\beta$) decay may suffer significant cancellations among\nits three components and thus sink into a decline, resulting in a \"well\" in the\nthree-dimensional graph of $|\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}|$ against the smallest\nneutrino mass $m^{}_1$ and the relevant Majorana phase $\\rho$. We present a new\nand complete analytical understanding of the fine issues inside such a well,\nand discover a novel threshold of $|\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}|$ in terms of the\nneutrino masses and flavor mixing angles: $|\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}|^{}_* =\nm^{}_3 \\sin^2\\theta^{}_{13}$ in connection with $\\tan\\theta^{}_{12} =\n\\sqrt{m^{}_1/m^{}_2}$ and $\\rho =\\pi$. This threshold point, which links the\n{\\it local} minimum and maximum of $|\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}|$, can be used to\nsignify observability or sensitivity of the future $0\\nu 2\\beta$-decay\nexperiments. Given current neutrino oscillation data, the possibility of\n$|\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}| < |\\langle m\\rangle^{}_{ee}|^{}_*$ is found to be\nvery small.\n", "  The optical theorem is an important tool for scattering analysis in\nacoustics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. We derive an extended\nversion of the optical theorem for the scattering of elastic waves by a\nspherical inclusion embedded in a linear elastic solid using a vector spherical\nharmonics representation of the waves. The sphere can be a rigid, empty cavity,\nelastic, viscoelastic, or layered material. The theorem expresses the\nextinction cross-section, i.e. the time-averaged power extracted from the\nincoming beam per its intensity, regarding the partial-wave expansion\ncoefficients of the incident and scattered waves. We establish the optical\ntheorem for a longitudinal spherically focused beam scattered by a sphere.\nMoreover, we use the optical theorem formalism to obtain the radiation force\nexerted on an inclusion by an incident plane wave and focused beam. Considering\nan iron sphere embedded in an aluminum matrix, we compute the scattering and\nelastic radiation force efficiencies. In addition, the elastic radiation force\nis obtained on a stainless steel sphere embedded in a tissue-like medium (soft\nsolid). Remarkably, we find a relative difference of up to $98\\%$ between our\nfindings and previous lossless liquid models. Regarding some applications, the\nobtained results have a direct impact on ultrasound-based elastography\ntechniques, ultrasonic nondestructive testing, as well as implantable devices\nactivated by ultrasound.\n", "  In the aligned two-Higgs-doublet model, we perform a complete one-loop\ncomputation of the short-distance Wilson coefficients $C_{7,9,10}^{(\\prime)}$,\nwhich are the most relevant ones for $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ transitions. It is\nfound that, when the model parameter $\\left|\\varsigma_u\\right|$ is much smaller\nthan $\\left|\\varsigma_d\\right|$, the charged-scalar contributes mainly to\nchirality-flipped $C_{9,10}^\\prime$, with the corresponding effects being\nproportional to $\\left|\\varsigma_d\\right|^2$. Numerically, the charged-scalar\neffects fit into two categories: (A) $C_{7,9,10}^\\mathrm{H^\\pm}$ are sizable,\nbut $C_{9,10}^{\\prime\\mathrm{H^\\pm}}\\simeq0$, corresponding to the (large\n$\\left|\\varsigma_u\\right|$, small $\\left|\\varsigma_d\\right|$) region; (B)\n$C_7^\\mathrm{H^\\pm}$ and $C_{9,10}^{\\prime\\mathrm{H^\\pm}}$ are sizable, but\n$C_{9,10}^\\mathrm{H^\\pm}\\simeq0$, corresponding to the (small\n$\\left|\\varsigma_u\\right|$, large $\\left|\\varsigma_d\\right|$) region. Taking\ninto account phenomenological constraints from the inclusive radiative decay\n$B\\to X_s\\gamma$, as well as the latest model-independent global analysis of\n$b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ data, we obtain the much restricted parameter space of the\nmodel. We then study the impact of the allowed model parameters on the angular\nobservables $P_2$ and $P_5'$ of $B^0\\to K^{\\ast 0}\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay, and find\nthat $P_5'$ could be increased significantly to be consistent with the\nexperimental data in case B.\n", "  The scattering of dark matter particles off nuclei in direct detection\nexperiments can be described in terms of a multidimensional effective field\ntheory (EFT). A new systematic analysis technique is developed using the EFT\napproach and Bayesian inference methods to exploit, when possible, the\nenergy-dependent information of the detected events, experimental efficiencies,\nand backgrounds. Highly dimensional likelihoods are calculated over the mass of\nthe weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and multiple EFT coupling\ncoefficients, which can then be used to set limits on these parameters and\nchoose models (EFT operators) that best fit the direct detection data.\nExpanding the parameter space beyond the standard spin-independent isoscalar\ncross section and WIMP mass reduces tensions between previously published\nexperiments. Combining these experiments to form a single joint likelihood\nleads to stronger limits than when each experiment is considered on its own.\nSimulations using two nonstandard operators (3 and 8) are used to test the\nproposed analysis technique in up to five dimensions and demonstrate the\nimportance of using multiple likelihood projections when determining\nconstraints on WIMP mass and EFT coupling coefficients. In particular, this\nshows that an explicit momentum dependence in dark matter scattering can be\nidentified.\n", "  Condensed matter systems undergoing second order transition away from the\ncritical fluctuation region are usually described sufficiently well by the mean\nfield approximation. The critical fluctuation region, determined by the\nGinzburg criterion, $\\left \\vert T/T_{c}-1\\right \\vert \\ll Gi$, is narrow even\nin high $T_{c}$ superconductors and has universal features well captured by the\nrenormalization group method. However recent experiments on magnetization,\nconductivity and Nernst effect suggest that fluctuations effects are large in a\nwider region both above and below $T_{c}$. In particular some \"pseudogap\"\nphenomena and strong renormalization of the mean field critical temperature\n$T_{mf}$ can be interpreted as strong fluctuations effects that are\nnonperturbative (cannot be accounted for by \"gaussian fluctuations\"). The\nphysics in a broader region therefore requires more accurate approach. Self\nconsistent methods are generally \"non - conserving\" in the sense that the Ward\nidentities are not obeyed. This is especially detrimental in the symmetry\nbroken phase where, for example, Goldstone bosons become massive. Covariant\ngaussian approximation remedies these problems. The Green's functions obey all\nthe Ward identities and describe the fluctuations much better. The results for\nthe order parameter correlator and magnetic penetration depth of the Ginzburg -\nLandau model of superconductivity are compared with both Monte Carlo\nsimulations and experiments in high $T_{c}$ cuprates.\n", "  We here numerically investigate the heat transport behavior in a\none-dimensional lattice with a soft-type (ST) anharmonic interparticle\ninteraction. It is found that with the increase of system's temperature, while\nthe introduction of ST anharmonicity softens phonons and decreases their\nvelocities, this type of nonlinearity like its counterpart of hard type (HT),\ncan still not be able to fully damp the longest wave phonons. Therefore, an\nanomalous temperature dependent heat transport with certain scaling properties\nsimilarly to those in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam like systems with HT interactions\ncan be seen. Our detailed examination from simulations well verify this\ntemperature dependent behavior.\n", "  In order to improve the time precision of detectors based on diamonds sensors\nwe have built a detector with two scCVD layers connected in parallel to the\nsame amplifier. This note describes the design and the first measurements of\nsuch a prototype performed on a particle beam at CERN. With this different\nconfiguration we have obtained an improvement on the timing precision of a\nfactor of 1.6-1.7 with respect to a single layer scCVD diamond detector.\n", "  For the measurement of the electric dipole moment of protons and deuterons, a\nnovel waveguide RF Wien filter has been designed and will soon be integrated at\nthe COoler SYnchrotron at J\\\"ulich. The device operates at the harmonic\nfrequencies of the spin motion. It is based on a waveguide structure that is\ncapable of fulfilling the Wien filter condition ($\\vec{E} \\perp \\vec{B}$)\n\\textit{by design}. The full-wave calculations demonstrated that the waveguide\nRF Wien filter is able to generate high-quality RF electric and magnetic\nfields. In reality, mechanical tolerances and misalignments decrease the\nsimulated field quality, and it is therefore important to consider them in the\nsimulations. In particular, for the electric dipole moment measurement, it is\nimportant to quantify the field errors systematically. Since Monte-Carlo\nsimulations are computationally very expensive, we discuss here an efficient\nsurrogate modeling scheme based on the Polynomial Chaos Expansion method to\ncompute the field quality in the presence of tolerances and misalignments and\nsubsequently to perform the sensitivity analysis at zero additional\ncomputational cost.\n", "  Future cosmic microwave background polarization experiments will search for\nevidence of primordial tensor modes at large angular scales, in the multipole\nrange $4 \\leq \\ell \\leq 50.$ Because in that range there is some mild evidence\nof departures from scale invariance in the power spectrum of primordial\ncurvature perturbations, one may wonder about the possibility of similar\ndeviations appearing in the primordial power spectrum of tensor modes. Here we\naddress this issue and analyze the possible presence of features in the tensor\nspectrum resulting from the dynamics of primordial fluctuations during\ninflation. We derive a general, model independent, relation linking features in\nthe spectra of curvature and tensor perturbations. We conclude that even with\nlarge deviations from scale invariance in the curvature power spectrum, the\ntensor spectrum remains scale invariant for all observational purposes.\n", "  A large fraction of white dwarf stars shows photospheric chemical composition\npolluted by heavy elements accreted from a debris disk. Such debris disks\nresult from the tidal disruption of rocky planetesimals which had survived to\nwhole stellar evolution from the main sequence to the final white dwarf stage.\nDetermining the accretion rate of this material is an important step towards\nestimating the mass of the planetesimals and towards understanding the ultimate\nfate of the planetary systems. The accretion of heavy material with a mean\nmolecular weight, $\\mu$, higher than the mean molecular weight of the white\ndwarf outer layers, induces a double-diffusive instability producing fingering\nconvection and extra-mixing. As a result, the accreted material is diluted deep\ninto the star. We explore the effect of this extra-mixing on the abundance\nevolution of Mg, O, Ca, Fe and Si in the cases of the two well studied polluted\nDAZ white dwarfs: GD~133 and G~29-38. We performed numerical simulations of the\naccretion of material with a chemical composition similar to the bulk Earth\none. We considered accretion rates from $10^{4}$~g/s to $10^{10}$~g/s. The\ndouble-diffusive instability develops on a very short time scale. The accretion\nrate needed to reproduce the observed abundances exceeds by more than 2 orders\nof magnitude the rate estimated by neglecting the fingering convection in the\ncase of GD~133, and by approximately 1.7 dex in the case of G~29-38. Our\nnumerical simulations show that fingering convection is an efficient mechanism\nto mix the accreted material and that it must be taken into account in the\ndetermination of accretion rates.\n", "  Bound state poles in the $S$-matrix of perturbative QED are generated by the\n{\\em divergence} of the expansion in $\\alpha$. The perturbative corrections are\nnecessarily singular when expanding around free, \\order{\\alpha^0} $in$ and\n$out$ states that have no overlap with finite-sized atomic wave functions.\nNevertheless, measurables such as binding energies do have well-behaved\nexpansions in powers of $\\alpha$ (and $\\log\\alpha$).\n  It is desirable to formulate the concept of \"lowest order\" for gauge theory\nbound states such that higher order corrections vanish in the $\\alpha \\to 0$\nlimit. This may allow to determine a lowest order term for QCD hadrons which\nincorporates essential features such as confinement and chiral symmetry\nbreaking, and thus can serve as the starting point of a useful perturbative\nexpansion.\n  I discuss a \"Born\" (no loop, lowest order in $\\hbar$) approximation. Born\nlevel states are bound by gauge fields which satisfy the classical field\nequations. Gauss' law determines a distinct field $A^0(\\xv)$ for each\ninstantaneous position of the charges. A Poincar\\'e covariant boundary\ncondition for the gluon field leads to a confining potential for $q\\bar q$ and\n$qqq$ states. In frames where the bound state is in motion the classical gauge\nfield is obtained by a Lorentz boost of the rest frame field.\n", "  We review the Kubo formulae relevant to study anomalous transport properties\nof relativistic fluids. We apply this formalism to perform a computation of the\ntransport coefficients in a holographic massive gravity model including\nvorticity and external electromagnetic fields. We find an interesting phase in\nwhich the electric DC conductivity is negligible, while the anomalous\nconductivities turn out to be nonvanishing.\n", "  This second paper on the Fabry-Perot cavity presents a semi-classical\napproach, which means that we consider the transition from wave optics to\ngeometrical optics. The basic concepts are the periodic orbits and their\nstability. For the plano-concave Fabry-Perot cavity in the paraxial\napproximation, the derivation of the trace formula demonstrates that the\nspectrum is based only on the axial periodic orbit and its repetitions.\nExperiments with micro-lasers illustrate the relation to periodic orbits. The\nmethods presented in this paper are not limited to laser cavities and can be\napplied to a large range of wave systems.\n", "  We have performed electronic structure calculations to explore the band-gap\ndependence on polytypes for $sp^3$-bonded semiconducting materials, i.e., SiC,\nAlN, BN, GaN, Si, and diamond. In this comprehensive study, we have found that\nband-gap variation depending on polytypes is common in $sp^3$-bonded\nsemiconductors; SiC, AlN, and BN exhibit smallest band gaps in $3C$ structure,\nwhereas diamond does in $2H$ structure. We have also clarified that the\nmicroscopic mechanism of the band-gap variations is attributed to peculiar\nelectron states $floating$ in internal channel space at the conduction-band\nminimum (CBM), and that internal channel length and the electro-static\npotential in channel affect the energy level of CBM.\n", "  We revisit the issue of the vacuum angle theta dependence in weakly coupled\n(Higgsed) Yang-Mills theories. Two most popular mechanisms for eliminating\nphysical theta dependence are massless quarks and axions. Anselm and Johansen\nnoted that the vacuum angle theta(EW), associated with the electroweak SU(2) in\nthe Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model, is unobservable although all fermion fields\nobtain masses through Higgsing and there is no axion. We generalize this idea\nto a broad class of Higgsed Yang-Mills theories.\n  In the second part we consider consequences of Grand Unification. We start\nfrom a unifying group, e.g. SU(5), at a high ultraviolet scale and evolve the\ntheory down within the Wilson procedure. If on the way to infrared the unifying\ngroup is broken down into a few factors, all factor groups inherit one and the\nsame theta angle -- that of the unifying group. We show that embedding the SM\nin SU(5) drastically changes the Anselm-Johansen conclusion: the electroweak\nvacuum angle theta(EW), equal to theta(QCD) becomes in principle observable in\n\\Delta B=\\Delta L =\\pm 1 processes. We also note in passing that if the axion\nmechanism is set up above the unification scale, we have one and the same axion\nin the electroweak theory and QCD, and their impacts are interdependent.\n", "  We consider a class of heterotic N=2 -> 0 super no-scale Z_2-orbifold models.\nAn appropriate stringy Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking induces tree level\nmasses to all massless bosons of the twisted hypermultiplets and therefore\nstabilizes all twisted moduli. At high supersymmetry breaking scale, the\ntachyons that occur in the N=4 -> 0 parent theories are projected out, and no\nHagedorn-like instability takes place in the N=2 -> 0 models (for small enough\nmarginal deformations). At low supersymmetry breaking scale, the stability of\nthe untwisted moduli is studied at the quantum level by taking into account\nboth untwisted and twisted contributions to the 1-loop effective potential. The\nlatter depends on the specific branch of the gauge theory along which the\nbackground can be deformed. We derive its expression in terms of all classical\nmarginal deformations in the pure Coulomb phase, and in some mixed\nCoulomb/Higgs phases. In this class of models, the super no-scale condition\nrequires having at the massless level equal numbers of untwisted bosonic and\ntwisted fermionic degrees of freedom. Finally, we show that N=1 -> 0 super\nno-scale models are obtained by implementing a second Z_2 orbifold twist on N=2\n-> 0 super no-scale Z_2-orbifold models.\n", "  We have studied the slip length of confined liquid with small roughness of\nsolid-liquid interfaces. Dyadic Green function and perturbation expansion have\nbeen applied to get the slip length quantitatively. In the slip length, both\neffects of the roughness of the interfaces and the chemical interaction between\nthe liquid and the solid surface are involved. For the numerical calculation,\nMonte Carlo method has been used to simulate the rough interfaces and the\nphysical quantities are obtained statistically over the interfaces. Results\nshow that the total slip length of the system is linearly proportional to the\nslip length contributed from the chemical interaction. And the roughness of the\ninterfaces plays its role as the proportionality factor. For the roughness, the\nvariance of the roughness decreases the total slip length while the correlation\nlength of the roughness can enhance the slip length dramatically to a\nsaturation value.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize fast generation of three-dimensional\nentanglement between two atoms via superadiabatic-based shortcuts in an\natom-cavity-fiber system. The scheme is experimentally feasible because of the\nsame form of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian as that of the effective\nHamiltonian. Besides, numerical simulations are given to prove that the scheme\nis strongly robust against variations in various parameters and decoherence.\n", "  It has become clear that the anomalous properties of cuprate superconductors\nare intimately related to the formation of a pseudogap. Within the framework of\nthe kinetic-energy-driven superconducting mechanism, the effect of the\npseudogap on the electronic Raman response of cuprate superconductors in the\nsuperconducting-state is studied by taking into account the interplay between\nthe superconducting gap and pseudogap. It is shown that the low-energy spectra\nalmost rise as the cube of energy in the B_{1g} channel and linearly with\nenergy in the B_{2g} channel. However, the pseudogap is strongly anisotropic in\nmomentum space, where the magnitude of the pseudogap around the nodes is\nsmaller than that around the antinodes, which leads to that the low-energy\nspectral weight of the B_{1g} spectrum is suppressed heavily by the pseudogap,\nwhile the pseudogap has a more modest effect on the electronic Raman response\nin the B_{2g} orientation.\n", "  We determine the frequency dependence of four independent CdWO$_4$ Cartesian\ndielectric function tensor elements by generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry\nwithin mid-infrared and far-infrared spectral regions. Single crystal surfaces\ncut under different angles from a bulk crystal, (010) and (001), are\ninvestigated. From the spectral dependencies of the dielectric function tensor\nand its inverse we determine all long wavelength active transverse and\nlongitudinal optic phonon modes with $A_u$ and $B_u$ symmetry as well as their\neigenvectors within the monoclinic lattice. We thereby demonstrate that such\ninformation can be obtained completely without physical model line shape\nanalysis in materials with monoclinic symmetry. We then augment the effect of\nlattice anharmonicity onto our recently described dielectric function tensor\nmodel approach for materials with monoclinic and triclinic crystal symmetries\n[Phys. Rev. B, 125209 (2016)], and we obtain excellent match between all\nmeasured and modeled dielectric function tensor elements. All phonon mode\nfrequency and broadening parameters are determined in our model approach. We\nalso perform density functional theory phonon mode calculations, and we compare\nour results obtained from theory, from direct dielectric function tensor\nanalysis, and from model lineshape analysis, and we find excellent agreement\nbetween all approaches. We also discuss and present static and above\nreststrahlen spectral range dielectric constants. Our data for CdWO$_4$ are in\nexcellent agreement with a recently proposed generalization of the\nLyddane-Sachs-Teller relation for materials with low crystal symmetry [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 117, 215502 (2016)].\n", "  Powerful radio galaxies exist as either compact or extended sources, with the\nextended sources traditionally classified by their radio morphologies as\nFanaroff--Riley (FR) type I and II sources. FRI/II and compact radio galaxies\nhave also been classified by their optical spectra into two different types:\nhigh excitation (HERG; quasar-mode) and low excitation (LERG; jet-mode). We\npresent a catalogue of visual morphologies for a complete sample of $>$1000\n1.4-GHz-selected extended radio sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We\nstudy the environment and host galaxy properties of FRI/II and compact sources,\nclassified into HERG/LERG types, in order to separate and distinguish the\nfactors that drive the radio morphological variations from those responsible\nfor the spectral properties. Comparing FRI LERGs with FRII LERGs at fixed\nstellar mass and radio luminosity, we show that FRIs typically reside in richer\nenvironments and are hosted by smaller galaxies with higher mass surface\ndensity; this is consistent with extrinsic effects of jet disruption driving\nthe FR dichotomy. Using matched samples of HERGs and LERGs, we show that HERG\nhost galaxies are more frequently star-forming, with more evidence for\ndisk-like structure than LERGs, in accordance with currently-favoured models of\nfundamentally different fuelling mechanisms. Comparing FRI/II LERGs with\ncompact LERGs, we find the primary difference is that compact objects typically\nharbour less massive black holes. This suggests that lower-mass black holes may\nbe less efficient at launching stable radio jets, or do so for shorter times.\nFinally, we investigate rarer sub-classes: wide-angle tail, head-tail,\nFR-hybrid and double-double sources.\n", "  The Romans type IIA supergravity allows fundamental strings to have explicit\nmass term at the tree level. We show that there exists a (F1,D2,D8) brane\nconfiguration which gives rise to $Lif_4^{(2)}\\times {R}^1\\times S^5$ vacua\nsupported by the massive strings. The presence of D8-branes naturally excites\nmassive fundamental strings. A compactification on circle relates these\nLifshitz massive type-IIA background with the axion-flux $Lif_4^{(2)}\\times\n{S}^1\\times S^5$ vacua in ordinary type-IIB theory. The massive T-duality in\neight dimensions further relates them to yet another\n$\\widetilde{Lif}_4^{(2)}\\times S^1\\times S^5$ vacua constituted by (F1,D0,D6)\nsystem in ordinary type IIA theory. The latter vacua after compactification to\nfour dimensions generate two `distinct' electric charges and a constant\nmagnetic field, all living over 2-dimensional plane. This somewhat reminds us\nof a similar set up in quantum Hall systems.\n", "  Double $J/\\psi$ production in $e^+e^-$ collisions involving colour-octet\nchannels are evaluated up to order $\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^3$. Having implemented the\nvariation of the parameters ($m_c$, $\\mu_r$ and long-distance matrix elements),\nwe found that the cross sections for producing double $J/\\psi$ at B-factories\nrange from $-0.016$fb to $0.245$fb, which are even much smaller than that via\nthe colour-siglet mechanism. Accordingly, this result is consistent with the\nmeasurement by the Belle and BABAR Collaborations.\n", "  As the 3D spatial properties of exoplanet atmospheres are being observed in\nincreasing detail by current and new generations of telescopes, the modelling\nof the 3D scattering effects of cloud forming atmospheres with inhomogeneous\nopacity structures becomes increasingly important to interpret observational\ndata. We model the scattering and emission properties of a simulated cloud\nforming, inhomogeneous opacity, hot Jupiter atmosphere of HD 189733b. We\ncompare our results to available HST and Spitzer data and quantify the effects\nof 3D multiple-scattering on observable properties of the atmosphere. We\ndiscuss potential observational properties of HD 189733b for the upcoming TESS\nand CHEOPS missions. We develop a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and apply\nit to post-process output of our 3D radiative-hydrodynamic, cloud formation\nsimulation of HD 189733b. We employ three variance reduction techniques; next\nevent estimation, survival biasing and composite emission biasing to improve\nsignal-to-noise of the output.For cloud particle scattering events, a\nlog-normal area distribution is constructed from the 3D cloud formation RHD\nresults and stochastically sampled in order to model the Rayleigh and Mie\nscattering behaviour of a mixture of grain sizes. Stellar photon packets\nincident on the eastern dayside hemisphere show predominantly Rayleigh,\nsingle-scattering behaviour, while multiple-scattering occurs on the western\nhemisphere. Combined scattered and thermal emitted light predictions are\nconsistent with published HST and Spitzer secondary transit observations. Our\nmodel predictions are also consistent with geometric albedo constraints from\noptical wavelength ground based polarimetry and HST B-band measurements. We\npredict an apparent geometric albedo for HD 189733b of 0.205 and 0.229, in the\nTESS and CHEOPS photometric bands respectively.\n", "  The quartic effective action for Kaluza-Klein modes that arises upon\ncompactification of type IIB supergravity on the five-sphere S^5 is a starting\npoint for computing the four-point correlation functions of arbitrary weight\n1/2-BPS operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the supergravity\napproximation. The apparent structure of this action is rather involved, in\nparticular it contains quartic terms with four derivatives which cannot be\nremoved by field redefinitions. By exhibiting intricate identities between\ncertain integrals involving spherical harmonics of S^5 we show that the net\ncontribution of these four-derivative terms to the effective action vanishes.\nOur result is in agreement with and provides further support to the recent\nconjecture on the Mellin space representation of the four-point correlation\nfunction of any 1/2-BPS operators in the supergravity approximation.\n", "  We present an ongoing, systematic search for extragalactic infrared\ntransients, dubbed SPIRITS --- SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey. In\nthe first year, using Spitzer/IRAC, we searched 190 nearby galaxies with\ncadence baselines of one month and six months. We discovered over 1958\nvariables and 43 transients. Here, we describe the survey design and highlight\n14 unusual infrared transients with no optical counterparts to deep limits,\nwhich we refer to as SPRITEs (eSPecially Red Intermediate Luminosity Transient\nEvents). SPRITEs are in the infrared luminosity gap between novae and\nsupernovae, with [4.5] absolute magnitudes between -11 and -14 (Vega-mag) and\n[3.6]-[4.5] colors between 0.3 mag and 1.6 mag. The photometric evolution of\nSPRITEs is diverse, ranging from < 0.1 mag/yr to > 7 mag/yr. SPRITEs occur in\nstar-forming galaxies. We present an in-depth study of one of them, SPIRITS\n14ajc in Messier 83, which shows shock-excited molecular hydrogen emission.\nThis shock may have been triggered by the dynamic decay of a non-hierarchical\nsystem of massive stars that led to either the formation of a binary or a\nproto-stellar merger.\n", "  We present a combined resummation for the transverse momentum distribution of\na colorless final state in perturbative QCD, expressed as a function of\ntransverse momentum pt and the scaling variable x. Its expression satisfies\nthree requirements: it reduces to standard transverse momentum resummation to\nany desired logarithmic order in the limit pt-> 0 for fixed x, up to power\nsuppressed corrections in pt; it reduces to threshold resummation to any\ndesired logarithmic order in the limit x-> 1 for fixed pt, up to power\nsuppressed correction in 1-x; upon integration over transverse momentum it\nreproduces the resummation of the total cross cross at any given logarithmic\norder in the threshold x->1 limit. Its main ingredient, and our main new\nresult, is a modified form of transverse momentum resummation, which leads to\nthreshold resummation upon integration over pt, and for which we provide a\nsimple closed-form analytic expression in Fourier-Mellin (b,N) space. We give\nexplicit coefficients up to NNLL order for the specific case of Higgs\nproduction in gluon fusion in the effective field theory limit. Our result\nallows for a systematic improvement of the transverse momentum distribution\nthrough threshold resummation which holds for all pt, and elucidates the\nrelation between transverse momentum resummation and threshold resummation at\nthe inclusive level, specifically by providing within perturbative QCD a simple\nderivation of the main consequence of the so-called collinear anomaly of SCET.\n", "  An intense X wave propagating perpendicularly to dc magnetic field is\nunstable with respect to a parametric decay into an electron Bernstein wave and\na lower-hybrid wave. A modified theory of this effect is proposed that extends\nto the high-intensity regime, where the instability rate $\\gamma$ ceases to be\na linear function of the incident-wave amplitude. An explicit formula for\n$\\gamma$ is derived and expressed in terms of cold-plasma parameters. Theory\npredictions are in reasonable agreement with the results of the\nparticle-in-cell simulations presented in a separate publication.\n", "  Many theories beyond the Standard Model include extra dimensions, though\nthese have yet to be directly observed. In this work we consider the\npossibility of a compactification mechanism which both allows extra dimensions\nand is compatible with current observations. This compactification is predicted\nto leave a signature on the CMB by altering the amplitude of the low l\nmultipoles, dependent on the amount of inflation. Recently discovered CMB\nanomalies at low multipoles may be evidence for this. In our model we assume\nthe spacetime is the product of a four-dimensional spacetime and flat extra\ndimensions. Before the compactification, both the four-dimensional space- time\nand the extra dimensions can either be expanding or contracting independently.\nTaking into account physical constraints, we explore the observational\nconsequences and the plausibility of these different models.\n", "  Motivated by discrete kinetic models for non-cooperative molecular motors on\nperiodic tracks, we consider random walks (also not Markov) on quasi one\ndimensional (1d) lattices, obtained by gluing several copies of a fundamental\ngraph in a linear fashion. We show that, for a suitable class of quasi 1d\nlattices, the large deviation rate function associated to the position of the\nwalker satisfies a Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry for any choice of the dynamical\nparameters defining the stochastic walk. This class includes the linear model\nconsidered in \\cite{LLM1}. We also derive fluctuation theorems for the\ntime-integrated cycle currents and discuss how the matrix approach of\n\\cite{LLM1} can be extended to derive the above Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry for\nany Markov random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}$ with periodic jump rates. Finally, we\nreview in the present context some large deviation results of \\cite{FS1} and\ngive some specific examples with explicit computations.\n", "  The rapid growth in scale and complexity of both computational and\nobservational astrophysics over the past decade necessitates efficient and\nintuitive methods for examining and visualizing large datasets. Here we discuss\nsome newly developed tools to import and manipulate astrophysical data into the\nthree dimensional visual effects software, {\\it Houdini}. This software is\nwidely used by visual effects artists, but a recently implemented Python API\nnow allows astronomers to more easily use Houdini as a visualization tool. This\npaper includes a description of features, work flow, and various example\nvisualizations. The project website, www.ytini.com, contains Houdini tutorials\nand links to the Python script Bitbucket repository aimed at a scientific\naudience to simplify the process of importing and rendering astrophysical data.\n", "  We show that macro-molecular self-assembly can recognize and classify\nhigh-dimensional patterns in the concentrations of $N$ distinct molecular\nspecies. Similar to associative neural networks, the recognition here leverages\ndynamical attractors to recognize and reconstruct partially corrupted patterns.\nTraditional parameters of pattern recognition theory, such as sparsity,\nfidelity, and capacity are related to physical parameters, such as nucleation\nbarriers, interaction range, and non-equilibrium assembly forces. Notably, we\nfind that self-assembly bears greater similarity to continuous attractor neural\nnetworks, such as place cell networks that store spatial memories, rather than\ndiscrete memory networks. This relationship suggests that features and\ntrade-offs seen here are not tied to details of self-assembly or neural network\nmodels but are instead intrinsic to associative pattern recognition carried out\nthrough short-ranged interactions.\n", "  In this paper the problem is posed of determining the physically-meaningful\nasymptotic orderings holding for the statistical description of a large\n$N-$body system of hard spheres,\\textit{ i.e.,} formed by\n$N\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\gg1$ particles, which are allowed to undergo\ninstantaneous and purely elastic unary, binary or multiple collisions. Starting\npoint is the axiomatic treatment recently developed [Tessarotto \\textit{et\nal}., 2013-2016] and the related discovery of an exact kinetic equation\nrealized by Master equation which advances in time the $1-$body probability\ndensity function (PDF) for such a system. As shown in the paper the task\ninvolves introducing appropriate asymptotic orderings in terms of $\\varepsilon$\nfor all the physically-relevant parameters. The goal is that of identifying the\nrelevant physically-meaningful asymptotic approximations applicable for the\nMaster kinetic equation, together with their possible relationships with the\nBoltzmann and Enskog kinetic equations, and holding in appropriate asymptotic\nregimes. These correspond either to dilute or dense systems and are formed\neither by small-size or finite-size identical hard spheres, the distinction\nbetween the various cases depending on suitable asymptotic orderings in terms\nof $\\varepsilon.$\n", "  We present a sample of results for the cross sections of several processes of\nlow energetic $e^+e^-$ annihilation into final states containing pions\naccompanied by one or two photons, or a light lepton pair. The results, which\nhave been obtained with a new version of a multipurpose Monte Carlo program\nCARLOMAT, labelled 3.1, demonstrate new capabilities of the program which,\namong others, include a possibility of taking into account either the initial\nor final state radiation separately, or both at a time, and a possibility of\ninclusion of the electromagnetic charged pion form factor for processes with\ncharged pion pairs. We also discuss some problems related to the $U(1)$\nelectromagnetic gauge invariance.\n", "  Numerical simulations of heat transport in diamond anvil cells reveal a\npossibility for absolute measurements of specific heat via high-frequency\nmodulation calorimetry. Such experiments could reveal and help characterize\ntemperature-driven phase transitions at high-pressure, such as melting, the\nglass transition, magnetic and electric orderings, or superconducting\ntransitions. Specifically, we show that calorimetric information of a sample\ncannot be directly extracted from measurements at frequencies slower than the\ntimescale of conduction to the diamond anvils (10s to 100s of kHz) since the\nexperiment is far from adiabatic. At higher frequencies, laser-heating\nexperiments allow relative calorimetric measurements, where changes in specific\nheat of the sample are discriminated from changes in other material properties\nby scanning the heating frequency from $\\sim 1$ MHz to 1 GHz. But laser-heating\ngenerates large temperature gradients in metal samples, preventing absolute\nheat capacities to be inferred. High-frequency Joule heating, on the other\nhand, allows accurate, absolute specific heat measurements if it can be\nperformed at high-enough frequency: assuming a thin layer of KBr insulation,\nthe specific heat of a 5 $\\mu$m-thick metal sample heated at 100 kHz, 1 MHz, or\n10 MHz frequency would be measured with 30%, 8% or 2% accuracy, respectively.\n", "  Part I shows that quantitative measurements of heat capacity are\ntheoretically possible inside diamond anvil cells via high-frequency Joule\nheating (100 kHz to 10 MHz), opening up the possibility of new methods to\ndetect and characterize transformations at high-pressure such as the glass\ntransitions, melting, magnetic orderings, or the onset of superconductivity.\nHere we test the possibility outlined in Part I, using prototypes and detailed\nnumerical models. First, a coupled electrical-thermal numerical model shows\nthat specific heat of metals inside diamond cells can be measured directly\nusing $\\sim 1$ MHz frequency, with $< 10%$ accuracy. Second, we test physical\nmodels of high-pressure experiments, i.e. diamond-cell mock-ups. Metal foils of\n2 to 6 $\\mu$m-thickness are clamped between glass insulation inside diamond\nanvil cells. Fitting data from 10 Hz to $\\sim 30$ kHz, we infer the specific\nheat capacities of Fe, Pt and Ni with $\\pm 20$ to $30%$ accuracy. The\nelectrical test equipment generates -80 dBc spurious harmonics which overwhelm\nthe thermally-induced harmonics at higher frequencies, disallowing the high\nprecision expected from numerical models. An alternative Joule-heating\ncalorimetry experiment, on the other hand, does allow absolute measurements\nwith $< 10%$ accuracy, despite the -80 dBc spurious harmonics: the measurement\nof thermal effusivity, $\\sqrt{\\rho c k}$ ($\\rho$, $c$ and $k$ being density,\nspecific heat and thermal conductivity), of the insulation surrounding a\nthin-film heater. Using a $\\sim 50$ nm-thick Pt heater surrounded by glass and\n10 Hz to 300 kHz frequency, we measure thermal effusivity with $\\pm 6%$\naccuracy inside the sample chamber of a diamond anvil cell.\n", "  We present a hybrid laser frequency stabilization method combining modulation\ntransfer spectroscopy (MTS) and frequency modulation spectroscopy (FMS) for the\ncesium D2 transition. In a typical pump-probe setup, the error signal is a\ncombination of the DC-coupled MTS error signal and the AC-coupled FMS error\nsignal. This combines the long-term stability of the former with the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the latter. In addition, we enhance the long-term\nfrequency stability with laser intensity stabilization. By measuring the\nfrequency difference between two independent hybrid spectroscopies, we\ninvestigate the short-term and long-term stability. We find a long-term\nstability of 7.8 kHz characterized by a standard deviation of the beating\nfrequency drift over the course of 10 hours, and a short-term stability of 1.9\nkHz characterized by an Allan deviation of that at 2 seconds of integration\ntime.\n", "  A third-order multireference perturbation theory based on the driven\nsimilarity renormalization group approach (DSRG-MRPT3) is presented. The\nDSRG-MRPT3 method has several appealing features: a) it is intruder free, b) it\nis size consistent, c) it leads to a non-iterative algorithm with ${\\cal\nO}(N^6)$ scaling, and d) it includes reference relaxation effects. The\nDSRG-MRPT3 scheme is benchmarked on the potential energy curves of F$_2$,\nH$_2$O$_2$, C$_2$H$_6$, and N$_2$ along the F-F, O-O, C-C, and N-N bond\ndissociation coordinates, respectively. The nonparallelism errors of DSRG-MRPT3\nare consistent to those of CASPT3 and MRCISD, and show significant improvements\nover those obtained from DSRG second-order multireference perturbation theory.\nOur efficient implementation of the DSRG-MRPT3 based on factorized electron\nrepulsion integrals enables studies of medium-sized open-shell organic\ncompounds. This point is demonstrated with computations of the singlet-triplet\nsplitting ($\\Delta_{\\rm ST} = E_{\\rm T} - E_{\\rm S}$) of 9,10-anthracyne. At\nthe DSRG-MRPT3 level of theory, our best estimate of the adiabatic $\\Delta_{\\rm\nST}$ is 3.9 kcal mol$^{-1}$, a value that is within 0.1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ from\nmultireference coupled cluster results.\n", "  Dilatonic black hole dyon-like solutions in the gravitational $4d$ model with\na scalar field, two 2-forms, two dilatonic coupling constants $\\lambda_i \\neq\n0$, $i =1,2$, obeying $\\lambda_1 \\neq - \\lambda_2$ and the sign parameter\n$\\varepsilon = \\pm 1$ for scalar field kinetic term are considered. Here\n$\\varepsilon = - 1$ corresponds to a ghost scalar field. These solutions are\ndefined up to solutions of two master equations for two moduli functions, when\n$\\lambda^2_i \\neq 1/2$ for $\\varepsilon = - 1$. Some physical parameters of the\nsolutions are obtained: gravitational mass, scalar charge, Hawking temperature,\nblack hole area entropy and parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters\n$\\beta$ and $\\gamma$. The PPN parameters do not depend on the couplings\n$\\lambda_i$ and $\\varepsilon$. A set of bounds on the gravitational mass and\nscalar charge are found by using a certain conjecture on the parameters of\nsolutions, when $1 +2 \\lambda_i^2 \\varepsilon > 0$, $i =1,2$.\n", "  We present an exact single-electron picture that describes the correlated\nelectron dynamics in strong laser fields. Our approach is based on the\nfactorization of the electronic wavefunction as a product of a marginal and a\nconditional amplitude. The marginal amplitude, which depends only on one\nelectronic coordinate and yields the exact one-electron density and current\ndensity, obeys a time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with an effective\ntime-dependent potential. The exact equations are used to derive an\napproximation that is a step towards a general and feasible ab-initio\nsingle-electron approximation for molecules. The derivation also challenges the\nusual interpretation of the single-active electron approximation. From the\nstudy of model systems, we find that the exact and approximate single-electron\npotentials for processes with negligible two-electron ionization lead to a\nqualitatively similar dynamics, but that the ionization barrier may be\nexplicitly time-dependent.\n", "  A new empirical formula has been developed that describes the $({\\gamma}, n)$\nnuclear reaction cross sections for the isotopes with $Z \\geq 60$. The results\nwere supported by calculations using TALYS - 1.6, EMPIRE - 3.2.2 nuclear\nmodular codes. The energy region for incident photon energy have been selected\nnear to the giant dipole resonance (GDR) peak energy. The evaluated empirical\ndata were compared with available data in the experimental data library -\nEXFOR. The data produced using TALYS - 1.6 and EMPIRE - 3.2.2 were in good\nagreement with experimental data. We have tested and presented the\nreproducibility of the present new empirical formula. We observed the\nreproducibility of the new empirical formula near to GDR peak energy is in good\nagreement with the experimental data and remarkable dependency on key nuclei\nproperties: the neutron, proton and atomic number of the nuclei. The behavior\nof nucleus near GDR peak energy, and dependency of GDR peak on the isotopic\nnature were predicted. An effort has been made to explain the deformation of\nthe GDR peak in $({\\gamma}, n)$ nuclear reaction cross section for some\nisotopes, which could not reproduce with TALYS - 1.6 and EMPIRE - 3.2.2. The\nevaluated data have been presented for the isotopes 180W, 183W, 202Pb, 203Pb,\n204Pb, 205Pb, 231Pa, 232U, 237U and 239Pu that have no previous measurements.\n", "  We report a high performance relative humidity (RH) microsensor by coating a\nfew-layer graphene oxide (GO) flake over a photonic crystal (PC) cavity. Since\nthe GO layer has a high water-activity and interacts with the evanescent cavity\nmode strongly, the exposure of GO-PC cavity in varied humidity levels results\nin significant resonant wavelength shifts, showing a slope of 0.68 nm/%RH in\nthe range of 60%-85% RH. By interrogating the power variation of the cavity\nreflection, the microsensor presents an ultrahigh sensitivity exceeding 3.9\ndB/%RH. Relying on the unimpeded permeation of water molecules through the GO\ninterlayers and microscale distribution of the cavity mode, the integrated\nsensor has a response time less than 100 ms, which promises successful\nmeasurements of human breathing. Combining with the ease of fabrication, this\nhigh performance RH sensor has potential applications requiring optical access,\ndevice compactness, and fast dynamic response.\n", "  We present large-scale molecular dynamics simulations for a coarse-grained\nmodel of polymer melts in equilibrium. From detailed Rouse mode analysis we\nshow that the time-dependent relaxation of the autocorrelation function (ACF)\nof modes $p$ can be well described by the effective stretched exponential\nfunction due to the crossover from Rouse to reptation regime. The ACF is\nindependent of chain sizes $N$ for $N/p<N_e$ ($N_e$ is the entanglement\nlength), and there exists a minimum of the stretching exponent as $N/p\n\\rightarrow N_e$. As $N/p$ increases, we verify the crossover scaling behavior\nof the effective relaxation time $\\tau_{{\\rm eff},p}$ from the Rouse regime to\nthe reptation regime. We have also provided evidence that the incoherent\ndynamic scattering function follows the same crossover scaling behavior of the\nmean square displacement of monomers at the corresponding characteristic time\nscales. The decay of the coherent dynamic scattering function is slowed down\nand a plateau develops as chain sizes increase at the intermediate time and\nwave length scales. The tube diameter extracted from the coherent dynamic\nscattering function is equivalent to the previous estimate from the mean square\ndisplacement of monomers.\n", "  Strain engineering has attracted great attention, particularly for epitaxial\nfilms grown on a different substrate. Residual strains of SiC have been widely\nemployed to form ultra-high frequency and high Q factor resonators. However, to\ndate the highest residual strain of SiC was reported to be limited to\napproximately 0.6%. Large strains induced into SiC could lead to several\ninteresting physical phenomena, as well as significant improvement of resonant\nfrequencies. We report an unprecedented nano strain-amplifier structure with an\nultra-high residual strain up to 8% utilizing the natural residual stress\nbetween epitaxial 3C SiC and Si. In addition, the applied strain can be tuned\nby changing the dimensions of the amplifier structure. The possibility of\nintroducing such a controllable and ultra-high strain will open the door to\ninvestigating the physics of SiC in large strain regimes, and the development\nof ultra sensitive mechanical sensors.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a system for wavefront shaping which generates\noptical foci through complex disordered media and achieves an enhancement\nfactor of greater than 100,000. To exploit the 1 Megapixel capacity of a\ndigital micro-mirror device and its fast frame rate, we developed a fast and\nefficient method to handle the heavy matrix algebra computation involved in\noptimizing the focus. We achieved an average enhancement factor of 101,391\nwithin an optimization time of 73 minutes. This unprecedented enhancement\nfactor may open new possibilities for realistic image projection and the\nefficient delivery of energy through scattering media.\n", "  We consider the $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $N_f=2$ flavors of Dirac\nfundamental fermions. We study the high-temperature behavior of the spectra of\nmesons, discretizing the theory on anisotropic lattices, and measuring the\ntwo-point correlation functions in the temporal direction as well as screening\nmasses in various channels. We identify the (pseudo-)critical temperature as\nthe temperature at which the susceptibility associated with the Polyakov loop\nhas a maximum. At high temperature both the spin-1 and spin-0 sectors of the\nlight meson spectra exhibit enhanced symmetry properties, indicating the\nrestoration of both the global $SU(4)$ and the axial $U(1)_A$ symmetries of the\nmodel.\n", "  The Unruh effect -- according to which linearly accelerated observers with\nproper acceleration a= constant in the (no-particle) vacuum state of inertial\nobservers experience a thermal bath of particles with temperature $T_U = a\n\\hbar / (2 \\pi k_B c)$ -- has just completed its 40$^{th}$ anniversary. A\n'direct' experimental confirmation of the Unruh effect has been seen with\nconcern because the linear acceleration needed to reach a temperature $1 K$ is\nof order $10^{20} m/s^2$. Although the Unruh effect can be rigorously\nconsidered as well tested as free quantum field theory itself, it would be\nsatisfying to observe some lab phenomenon which could evidence its existence.\nHere, we propose a simple experiment reachable under present technology whose\nresult may be directly interpreted in terms of the Unruh thermal bath. Then,\ninstead of waiting for experimentalists to perform the experiment, we use\nstandard classical electrodynamics to anticipate its output and show that it\nreveals the presence of a thermal bath with temperature $T_U$ in the\naccelerated frame. Unless one is willing to question the validity of classical\nelectrodynamics, this must be seen as a virtual observation of the Unruh\neffect. Regardless of doubts still raised by some voices, the Unruh effect\nlives among us.\n", "  Photoluminescence polarization is experimentally studied for samples with\n(In,Ga)As/GaAs selfassembled quantum dots in transverse magnetic field (Hanle\neffect) under slow modulation of the excitation light polarization from\nfractions of Hz to tens of kHz. The polarization reflects the evolution of\nstrongly coupled electron-nuclear spin system in the quantum dots. Strong\nmodification of the Hanle curves under variation of the modulation period is\nattributed to the peculiarities of the spin dynamics of quadrupole nuclei,\nwhich states are split due to deformation of the crystal lattice in the quantum\ndots. Analysis of the Hanle curves is fulfilled in the framework of a\nphenomenological model considering a separate dynamics of a nuclear field BNd\ndetermined by the +/- 12 nuclear spin states and of a nuclear field BNq\ndetermined by the split-off states +/- 3/2, +/- 5/2, etc. It is found that the\ncharacteristic relaxation time for the nuclear field BNd is of order of 0.5 s,\nwhile the relaxation of the field BNq is faster by three orders of magnitude.\n", "  We develop an ac-biased shift register introduced in our previous work (V.K.\nSemenov et al., IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond., vol. 25, no. 3, 1301507, June\n2015) into a benchmark circuit for evaluation of superconductor electronics\nfabrication technology. The developed testing technique allows for extracting\nmargins of all individual cells in the shift register, which in turn makes it\npossible to estimate statistical distribution of Josephson junctions in the\ncircuit. We applied this approach to successfully test registers having 8, 16,\n36, and 202 thousand cells and, respectively, about 33000, 65000, 144000, and\n809000 Josephson junctions. The circuits were fabricated at MIT Lincoln\nLaboratory, using a fully planarized process, 0.4 {\\mu}m inductor linewidth,\nand 1.33x10^6 cm^-2 junction density. They are presently the largest\noperational superconducting SFQ circuits ever made. The developed technique\ndistinguishes between hard defects (fabrication-related) and soft defects\n(measurement-related) and locates them in the circuit. The soft defects are\nspecific to superconducting circuits and caused by magnetic flux trapping\neither inside the active cells or in the dedicated flux-trapping moats near the\ncells. The number and distribution of soft defects depend on the ambient\nmagnetic field and vary with thermal cycling even if done in the same magnetic\nenvironment.\n", "  The aim of this paper is a better understanding for the eigenstates of the\nasymmetric quantum Rabi model by Lie algebra representations of\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We define a second order element of the universal enveloping\nalgebra $\\mathcal{U}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{R})$, which,\nthrough the action of a certain infinite dimensional representation of\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{R})$, provides a picture of the asymmetric quantum\nRabi model equivalent to the one drawn by confluent Heun ordinary differential\nequations. Using this description, we prove the existence of level crossings in\nthe spectral graph of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model when the\nsymmetry-breaking parameter $\\epsilon$ is equal to $\\frac12$, and conjecture a\nformula that ensures likewise the presence of level crossings for general\n$\\epsilon \\in \\frac12\\mathbb{Z}$. This result on level crossings was\ndemonstrated numerically by Li and Batchelor in 2015, investigating an earlier\nempirical observation by Braak (2011). The first analysis of the degenerate\nspectrum was given for the symmetric quantum Rabi model by Ku\\'s in 1985. In\nour picture, we find a certain reciprocity (or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry) for\n$\\epsilon \\in \\frac12\\mathbb{Z}$ if the spectrum is described by\nrepresentations of $\\frak{sl}_2$. We further discuss briefly the non-degenerate\npart of the exceptional spectrum from the viewpoint of infinite dimensional\nrepresentations of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ having lowest weight vectors.\n", "  Coherent control of chaotic molecular systems, using laser-assisted alignment\nof sulphur dioxide (SO$_2$) molecules in the presence of a static electric\nfield as an example, is considered. Conditions for which the classical version\nof this system is chaotic are established, and the quantum and classical\nanalogs are shown to be in very good correspondence. It is found that the chaos\npresent in the classical system does not impede the alignment, neither in the\nclassical nor the quantum system. Using the results of numerical calculations,\nwe suggest that laser-assisted alignment is stable against rotational chaos for\nall asymmetric top molecules.\n", "  We measured the absolute frequency of the $^1S_0$ - $^3P_0$ transition of\n$^{171}$Yb atoms confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice relative to the\nSI second. The determined frequency was 518 295 836 590 863.38(57) Hz. The\nuncertainty was reduced by a factor of 14 compared with our previously reported\nvalue in 2013 due to the significant improvements in decreasing the systematic\nuncertainties. This result is expected to contribute to the determination of a\nnew recommended value for the secondary representations of the second.\n", "  Energy level alignment at solid-solvent interfaces is an important step in\ndetermining the properties of electrochemical systems. The positions of\nconduction and valence band edges of a semiconductor are affected by its\nenvironment. In this study, using first-principles DFT calculation, we have\ndetermined the level shifts of the semiconductors TiO$_2$ and ZnO at the\ninterfaces with MeCN and DMF solvent molecules. The level shifts of\nsemiconductor is obtained using the potential difference between the clean and\nexposed surfaces of asymmetric slabs. In this work, neglecting the effects of\npresent ions in the electrolyte solution, we have shown that the solvent\nmolecules give rise to an up-shift for the levels, and the amount of this shift\nvaries with coverage. It is also shown that the shapes of density of states do\nnot change sensibly near the gap. Molecular dynamics simulations of the\ninterface have shown that at room temperatures the semiconductor surface is not\nfully covered by the solvent molecules, and one must use intermediate values in\nan static calculations.\n", "  Grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of circumstellar disks are often\nperformed in the curvilinear coordinate system, in which the center of the\ncomputational domain coincides with the motionless star. However, the center of\nmass may be shifted from the star due to the presence of any non-axisymmetric\nmass distribution. As a result, the system exerts a gravity force on the star,\ncausing the star to move in response, which can affect the evolution of the\ncircumstellar disk. We aim at studying the effects of stellar motion on the\nevolution of protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In protostellar disks, a\nnon-axisymmetric distribution of matter in the form of spiral arms or massive\nclumps can form due to gravitational instability. Protoplanetary disks can also\nfeature non-axisymmetric structures caused by a high-mass planet or a\nlarge-scale vortex. We use 2D grid-based hydrodynamic simulations to explore\nthe effect of stellar motion. We adopt a non-inertial polar coordinate system\ncentered on the star, in which the stellar motion is taken into account by\ncalculating the indirect potential caused by the non-axisymmetric disk, a\nhigh-mass planet, or a large-scale vortex. We found that the stellar motion has\na moderate effect on the evolution history in protostellar disks, reducing\nsomewhat the disk size and mass, while having a profound effect on the\ncollapsing envelope, changing its inner shape from an initially axisymmetric to\na non-axisymmetric configuration. Protoplanetary disk simulations show that the\nstellar motion slightly reduces the width of the gap opened by a high-mass\nplanet, decreases the planet migration rate, and strengthens the large-scale\nvortices formed at the viscosity transition. We conclude that the inclusion of\nthe indirect potential is recommended in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations\nof circumstellar disks which use the curvilinear coordinate system.\n", "  We propose supersymmetric Majoron inflation in which the Majoron field $\\Phi$\nresponsible for generating right-handed neutrino masses may also be suitable\nfor giving low scale \"hilltop\" inflation, with a discrete lepton number $Z_N$\nspontaneously broken at the end of inflation, while avoiding the domain wall\nproblem. In the framework of non-minimal supergravity, we show that a\nsuccessful spectral index can result with small running together with small\ntensor modes. We show that a range of heaviest right-handed neutrino masses can\nbe generated, $m_N\\sim 10^1-10^{16}$ GeV, consistent with the constraints from\nreheating and domain walls.\n", "  The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is optimized\nfor recording events in the very large particle multiplicity environment of\nheavy-ion collisions at LHC energies. The ALICE collaboration has taken data in\nPb-Pb collisions in Run I and Run II at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 2.76 and \\mbox{5.02 TeV}, respectively, and in pp\ncollisions at center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9, 2.76, 5.02, 7, 8 and 13\nTeV. The asymmetric system p-Pb was measured at a center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Selected physics results from the analysis\nof these data are presented, and an outline of the ALICE prospects for Run III\nis given.\n", "  Plastic deformation of metallic glasses performed well below the glass\ntransition temperature leads to the formation of shear bands as a result of\nshear localization. It is believed that shear banding originates from\nindividual stress concentrators having quadrupolar symmetry. To elucidate the\nunderlying mechanisms of shear band formation, microstructural investigations\nwere carried out on sheared zones using transmission electron microscopy. Here\nwe show evidence of a characteristic signature present in shear bands\nmanifested in the form of sinusoidal density variations. We present an\nanalytical solution for the observed post-deformation state derived from\ncontinuum mechanics using an alignment of quadrupolar stress field\nperturbations for the plastic events. Since we observe qualitatively similar\nfeatures for three different types of metallic glasses that span the entire\nrange of characteristic properties of metallic glasses, we conclude that the\nreported deformation behavior is generic for all metallic glasses, and thus has\nfar-reaching consequences for the deformation behavior of amorphous solids in\ngeneral.\n", "  Optical tools are of great promise for generation of spin waves due to the\npossibility to manipulate on ultrashort time scales and to provide local\nexcitation. However, a single laser pulse can inject spin waves only with a\nbroad frequency spectrum, resulting in a short propagation distance and low\namplitude. Here we excite a magnetic garnet film by a train of fs-laser pulses\nwith 1 GHz repetition rate so that pulse separation is smaller than decay time\nof the magnetic modes which allows to achieve collective photonic impact on\nmagnetization. It establishes a quasi-stationary source of SWs, namely a\ncoherent magnon accumulation (\"magnon cloud\"). This approach has several\nappealing features: (i) the source is tunable; (ii) the SW amplitude can be\nsignificantly enhanced; (iii) the spectrum of the generated SWs is quite narrow\nthat provides longer propagation distance; (iv) the periodic pumping results in\nalmost constant in time SW amplitude up to 100 um away from the source; and (v)\nthe SW emission shows a pronounced directionality. These results expand the\ncapabilities of ultrafast coherent optical control of magnetization and pave a\nway for applications in data processing, including the quantum regime. The\nquasi-stationary magnon accumulation might be also of interest for the problem\nof magnon Bose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  We study the role of field redefinitions in general scalar-tensor theories.\nIn particular, we first focus on the class of field redefinitions linear in the\nspin-2 field and involving derivatives of the spin-0 mode, generically known as\ndisformal transformations. We start by defining the action of a disformal\ntransformation in the tangent space. Then, we take advantage of the great\neconomy of means of the language of differential forms to compute the full\ntransformation of Horndeski's theory under general disformal transformations.\nWe obtain that Horndeski's action maps onto itself modulo a reduced set of\nnon-Horndeski Lagrangians. These new Lagrangians are found to be invariant\nunder disformal transformation that depend only in the first derivatives of the\nscalar. Moreover, these combinations of Lagrangians precisely appear when\nexpressing in our basis the constraints of the recently proposed Extended\nScalar-Tensor (EST) theories. These results allow us to classify the different\norbits of scalar-tensor theories invariant under particular disformal\ntransformations, namely the special disformal, kinetic disformal and disformal\nHorndeski orbits. In addition, we consider generalizations of this framework.\nWe find that there are possible well-defined extended disformal transformations\nthat have not been considered in the literature. However, they generically\ncannot link Horndeski theory with EST theories. Finally, we study further\ngeneralizations in which extra fields with different spin are included. These\nfield redefinitions can be used to connect different gravity theories such as\nmulti-scalar-tensor theories, generalized Proca theories and bi-gravity. We\ndiscuss how the formalism of differential forms could be useful for future\ndevelopments in these lines.\n", "  We derive integrable equations starting from autonomous mappings with a\ngeneral form inspired by the additive systems associated to the affine Weyl\ngroup E$_8^{(1)}$. By deautonomisation we obtain two hitherto unknown systems,\none of which turns out to be a linearisable one, and we show that both these\nsystems arise from the deautonomisation of a non-QRT mapping. In order to\nunambiguously prove the integrability of these nonautonomous systems, we\nintroduce a series of Miura transformations which allows us to prove that one\nof these systems is indeed a discrete Painlev\\'e equation, related to the\naffine Weyl group E$_7^{(1)}$, and to cast it in canonical form. A similar\nsequence of Miura transformations allows us to effectively linearise the second\nsystem we obtain. An interesting off-shoot of our calculations is that the\nseries of Miura transformations, when applied at the autonomous limit, allows\none to transform a non-QRT invariant into a QRT one.\n", "  Recent direct registration of gravitational waves by LIGO and astronomical\nobservations of the universe at redshifts 5-10 demonstrate that the standard\nastrophysics and cosmology are in tension with the data. The origin of the\nsource of the GW150914 event, which presumably is a binary of coalescing black\nholes with masses about 30 solar masses, each with zero spin, as well as the\ndensely populated universe at z= 5-10 by superheavy black holes, blight\ngalaxies, supernovae, and dust does not fit the standard astrophysical picture.\nIt is shown here that the model of primordial black hole (PBH) formation,\nsuggested in 1993, nicely explains all these and more puzzles, including those\nin contemporary universe, such as MACHOs and the mass spectrum of the observed\nsolar mass black holes.. The mass spectrum and density of PBH is predicted. The\nscenario may possibly lead to abundant antimatter in the universe and even in\nthe Galaxy.\n", "  The measurement of multiple ringdown modes in gravitational waves from binary\nblack hole mergers will allow for testing fundamental properties of black holes\nin General Relativity, and to constrain modified theories of gravity. To\nenhance the ability of Advanced LIGO/Virgo to perform such tasks, we propose a\ncoherent mode stacking method to search for a chosen target mode within a\ncollection of multiple merger events. We first rescale each signal so that the\ntarget mode in each of them has the same frequency, and then sum the waveforms\nconstructively. A crucial element to realize this coherent superposition is to\nmake use of a priori information extracted from the inspiral-merger phase of\neach event. To illustrate the method, we perform a study with simulated events\ntargeting the l=m=3 ringdown mode of the remnant black holes. We show that this\nmethod can significantly boost the signal-to-noise ratio of the collective\ntarget mode compared to that of the single loudest event. Using current\nestimates of merger rates we show that it is likely that advanced-era detectors\ncan measure this collective ringdown mode with one year of coincident data\ngathered at design sensitivity.\n", "  Transverse densities describe the distribution of charge and current at fixed\nlight-front time and provide a frame-independent spatial representation of\nhadrons as relativistic systems. We calculate the transverse densities of the\noctet baryons at peripheral distances b = O(M_pi^{-1}) in an approach combining\nchiral effective field theory (ChEFT) and dispersion analysis. The densities\nare represented as dispersive integrals of the imaginary parts of the baryon\nelectromagnetic form factors in the timelike region (spectral functions). The\nspectral functions on the two-pion cut at t > 4 M_pi^2 are computed using\nrelativistic ChEFT with octet and decuplet baryons in the EOMS renormalization\nscheme. The calculations are extended into the rho-meson mass region, using a\ndispersive method that incorporates the timelike pion form-factor data. The\napproach allows us to construct densities at distances b > 1 fm with controlled\nuncertainties. Our results provide insight into the peripheral structure of\nnucleons and hyperons and can be compared with empirical densities and\nlattice-QCD calculations.\n", "  In this work we outline the mechanisms contributing to the oxygen reduction\nreaction in nanostructured cathodes of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) for Solid Oxide\nFuel Cells (SOFC). These cathodes, developed from LSM nanostructured tubes, can\nbe used at lower temperatures compared to microstructured ones, and this is a\ncrucial fact to avoid the degradation of the fuel cell components. This\nreduction of the operating temperatures stems mainly from two factors: i) the\nappearance of significant oxide ion diffusion through the cathode material in\nwhich the nanostructure plays a key role and ii) an optimized gas phase\ndiffusion of oxygen through the porous structure of the cathode, which becomes\nnegligible. A detailed analysis of our Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy\nsupported by first principles calculations point towards an improved overall\ncathodic performance driven by a fast transport of oxide ions through the\ncathode surface.\n", "  The study of the Milky Way relies on our ability to interpret the light from\nstars correctly. This calls for a reinvestigation of how reliably we can\ndetermine, e.g., iron abundances in such stars and how well they reproduce\nthose of dwarf stars. Here we explore robust ways to determine the iron content\nof metal-rich giant stars. We aim to understand what biases and shortcomings\nwidely applied methods suffer from. In this study we are mainly concerned with\nstandard methods to analyse stellar spectra. This includes the analysis of\nindividual lines to determine stellar parameters, analysis of the broad wings\nof certain lines (e.g., H$\\alpha$ and calcium lines) to determine effective\ntemperature and surface gravity for the stars. For NGC 6528 we find that [Fe/H]\n= $+0.04$ dex with a scatter of $\\sigma=0.07$ dex, which gives an error in the\nderived mean abundance of 0.02 dex. Our work has two important conclusions for\nanalysis of metal-rich red giant branch stars. 1) For spectra with S/N below\nabout 35 per reduced pixel [Fe/H] become too high, 2) Determination of $T_{\\rm\neff}$ using the wings of the H$\\alpha$ line results in [Fe/H] values about 0.1\ndex higher than if excitational equilibrium is used. The last conclusion is\nperhaps not surprising as we expect NLTE effect to become more prominent in\ncooler stars and we can not use the the wings of the H$\\alpha$ line to\ndetermine $T_{\\rm eff}$ for the cool stars in our sample. We therefore\nrecommend that in studies of metal-rich red giant stars care needs to be taken\nto obtain sufficient calibration data in order to be able to also use the\ncooler stars.\n", "  We consider two distinct limits of General Relativity that in contrast to the\nstandard non-relativistic limit can be taken at the level of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action instead of the equations of motion. One is a\nnon-relativistic limit and leads to a so-called Galilei gravity theory, the\nother is an ultra-relativistic limit yielding a so-called Carroll gravity\ntheory. We present both gravity theories in a first-order formalism and show\nthat in both cases the equations of motion (i) lead to constraints on the\ngeometry and (ii) are not sufficient to solve for all of the components of the\nconnection fields in terms of the other fields. Using a second-order formalism\nwe show that these independent components serve as Lagrange multipliers for the\ngeometric constraints we found earlier. We point out a few noteworthy\ndifferences between Carroll and Galilei gravity and give some examples of\nmatter couplings.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional Ising model each of whose $N$ spins is in\ncontact with two thermostats of distinct temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$. Under\nGlauber dynamics the stationary state happens to coincide with the equilibrium\nstate at an effective intermediate temperature $T(T_1,T_2)$. The system\nnevertheless carries a nontrivial energy current between the thermostats. By\nmeans of the fermionization technique, for a chain initially in equilibrium at\nan arbitrary temperature $T_0$ we calculate the Fourier transform of the\nprobability $P({\\cal Q};\\tau)$ for the time-integrated energy current ${\\cal\nQ}$ during a finite time interval $\\tau$. In the long time limit we determine\nthe corresponding generating function for the cumulants per site and unit of\ntime $\\langle{\\cal Q}^n\\rangle_{\\rm c}/(N\\tau)$ and explicitly give those with\n$n=1,2,3,4.$ We exhibit various phenomena in specific regimes: kinetic\nmean-field effects when one thermostat flips any spin less often than the other\none, as well as dissipation towards a thermostat at zero temperature. Moreover,\nwhen the system size $N$ goes to infinity while the effective temperature $T$\nvanishes, the cumulants of ${\\cal Q}$ per unit of time grow linearly with $N$\nand are equal to those of a random walk process. In two adequate scaling\nregimes involving $T$ and $N$ we exhibit the dependence of the first correction\nupon the ratio of the spin-spin correlation length $\\xi(T)$ and the size $N$.\n", "  We compare classical versus quantum electron transport in recently\ninvestigated magnetic focusing devices [S. Bhandari et al., Nano Lett. 16, 1690\n(2016)] exposed to the perturbing potential of a scanning gate microscope\n(SGM). Using the Landauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism for a multi-terminal device, we\ncalculate resistance maps that are obtained as the SGM tip is scanned over the\nsample. There are three unique regimes in which the scanning tip can operate\n(focusing, repelling, and mixed regime) which are investigated. Tip interacts\nmostly with electrons with cyclotron trajectories passing directly underneath\nit, leaving a trail of modified current density behind it. Other (indirect)\ntrajectories become relevant when the tip is placed near the edges of the\nsample, and current is scattered between the tip and the edge. We also discuss\npossible explanations for spatial asymmetry of experimentally measured\nresistance maps, and connect it with specific configurations of the measuring\nprobes.\n", "  We compare the optical absorption of extended systems using the\ndensity-density and current-current linear response functions calculated within\nmany-body perturbation theory. The two approaches are formally equivalent for a\nfinite momentum $\\mathbf{q}$ of the external perturbation. At\n$\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{0}$, however, the equivalence is maintained only if a small\n$q$ expansion of the density-density response function is used. Moreover, in\npractical calculations this equivalence can be lost if one naively extends the\nstrategies usually employed in the density-based approach to the current-based\napproach. Specifically we discuss the use of a smearing parameter or of the\nquasiparticle lifetimes to describe the finite width of the spectral peaks and\nthe inclusion of electron-hole interaction. In those instances we show that the\nincorrect definition of the velocity operator and the violation of the\nconductivity sum rule introduce unphysical features in the optical absorption\nspectra of three paradigmatic systems: silicon (semiconductor), copper (metal)\nand lithium fluoride (insulator). We then demonstrate how to correctly\nintroduce lifetime effects and electron-hole interactions within the\ncurrent-based approach.\n", "  The control of complex networks is a significant challenge, especially when\nthe network topology of the system to be controlled is dynamic. Addressing this\nchallenge, here we introduce a novel approach which allows exploring the\ncontrollability of temporal networks. Studying six empirical data sets, we\nparticularly show that order correlations in the sequence of interactions can\nboth increase or decrease the time needed to achieve full controllability.\nCounter-intuitively, we find that this effect can be opposite than the effect\nof order correlations on other dynamical processes. Specifically, we show that\norder correlations that speed up a diffusion process in a given system can slow\ndown the control of the same system, and vice-versa. Building on the\nhigher-order graphical modeling framework introduced in recent works, we\nfurther demonstrate that spectral properties of higher-order network topologies\ncan be used to analytically explain this phenomenon.\n", "  We study deformations of the Almheiri-Polchinski (AP) model by employing the\nYang-Baxter deformation technique. The general deformed AdS$_2$ metric becomes\na solution of a deformed AP model. In particular, the dilaton potential is\ndeformed from a simple quadratic form to a hyperbolic function-type potential\nsimilarly to integrable deformations. A specific solution is a deformed black\nhole solution. Because the deformation makes the spacetime structure around the\nboundary change drastically and a new naked singularity appears, the\nholographic interpretation is far from trivial. The Hawking temperature is the\nsame as the undeformed case but the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified due\nto the deformation. This entropy can also be reproduced by evaluating the\nrenormalized stress tensor with an appropriate counter term on the regularized\nscreen close to the singularity.\n", "  In the framework of a multiscale modeling approach, we present a systematic\nstudy of a bipolar rectifying nanopore using a continuum and a particle\nsimulation method. The common ground in the two methods is the application of\nthe Nernst-Planck (NP) equation to compute ion transport in the framework of\nthe implicit-water electrolyte model. The difference is that the\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory is used in the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) approach,\nwhile the Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo (LEMC) method is used in the particle\nsimulation approach (NP+LEMC) to relate the concentration profile to the\nelectrochemical potential profile. Since we consider a bipolar pore which is\nshort and narrow, we perform simulations using two-dimensional PNP. In\naddition, results of a non-linear version of PNP that takes crowding of ions\ninto account are shown. We observe that the mean field approximation applied in\nPNP is appropriate to reproduce the basic behavior of the bipolar nanopore\n(e.g., rectification) for varying parameters of the system (voltage, surface\ncharge, electrolyte concentration, and pore radius). We present current data\nthat characterize the nanopore's behavior as a device, as well as\nconcentration, electrical potential, and electrochemical potential profiles.\n", "  A multi-scale approach for the theoretical description of deformed\nphosphorene is presented. This approach combines a valence-force model to\nrelate macroscopic strain to microscopic displacements of atoms and a\ntight-binding model with distance-dependent hopping parameters to obtain\nelectronic properties. The resulting self-consistent electromechanical model is\nsuitable for large-scale modeling of phosphorene devices. We demonstrate this\nfor the case of an inhomogeneously deformed phosphorene drum, which may be used\nas an exciton funnel.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have excessive dispersion measures (DMs) and an\nall-sky distribution, which point toward an extragalactic or even a\ncosmological origin. We develop a method to extract the mean host galaxy DM\n($\\left\\langle{\\rm DM_{HG,loc}}\\right\\rangle$) and the characterized luminosity\n($L$) of FRBs using the observed DM-Flux data, based on the assumption of a\nnarrow luminosity distribution. Applying Bayesian inference to the data of 21\nFRBs, we derive a relatively large mean host DM, i.e. $\\left\\langle{\\rm\nDM_{HG,loc}}\\right\\rangle \\sim 270~\\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$ with a large dispersion. A\nrelatively large ${\\rm DM_{HG}}$ of FRBs is also supported by the millisecond\nscattering times of some FRBs and the relatively small redshift $z=0.19273$ of\nFRB 121102 (which gives ${\\rm DM_{HG,loc}} \\sim 210 ~\\rm{pc~cm^{-3}}$). The\nlarge host galaxy DM may be contributed by the ISM or a near-source plasma in\nthe host galaxy. If it is contributed by the ISM, the type of the FRB host\ngalaxies would not be Milky Way (MW)-like, consistent with the detected host of\nFRB 121102. We also discuss the possibility of having a near-source supernova\nremnant (SNR), pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or HII region that gives a significant\ncontribution to the observed ${\\rm DM_{HG}}$.\n", "  The electric Weak Gravity Conjecture demands that axions with large decay\nconstant $f$ couple to light instantons. The resulting large instantonic\ncorrections pose problems for natural inflation. We explore an alternative\nargument based on the magnetic Weak Gravity Conjecture for axions, which we try\nto make more precise. Roughly speaking, it demands that the minimally charged\nstring coupled to the dual 2-form-field exists in the effective theory. Most\nnaively, such large-$f$ strings curve space too much to exist as static\nsolutions, thus ruling out large-$f$ axions. More conservatively, one might\nallow non-static string solutions to play the role of the required charged\nobjects. In this case, topological inflation would save the superplanckian\naxion. Furthermore, a large-$f$ axion may appear in the low-energy effective\ntheory based on two subplanckian axions in the UV. The resulting effective\nstring is a composite object built from several fundamental strings and domain\nwalls. It may or may not satisfy the magnetic Weak Gravity Conjecture depending\non how strictly the latter is interpreted and on the cosmological dynamics of\nthis composite object, which remain to be fully understood. Finally, we recall\nthat large-field brane inflation is naively possible in the codimension-one\ncase. We show how string-theoretic back-reaction closes this apparent loophole\nof large-$f$ (non-periodic) pseudo-axions.\n", "  The aim of the present contribution is to provide a framework for analyzing\nand visualizing the correlated many-electron dynamics of molecular systems,\nwhere an explicitly time-dependent electronic wave packet is represented as a\nlinear combination of $N$-electron wave functions. The central quantity of\ninterest is the electronic flux density, which contains all information about\nthe transient electronic density, the associated phase, and their temporal\nevolution. It is computed from the associated one-electron operator by reducing\nthe multi-determinantal, many-electron wave packet using the Slater-Condon\nrules. Here, we introduce a general tool for post-processing multi-determinant\nconfiguration-interaction wave functions obtained at various levels of theory.\nIt is tailored to extract directly the data from the output of standard quantum\nchemistry packages using atom-centered Gaussian-type basis functions. The\nprocedure is implemented in the open-source Python program detCI@ORBKIT, which\nshares and builds upon the modular design of our recently published\npost-processing toolbox [J. Comput. Chem. 37 (2016) 1511]. The new procedure is\napplied to ultrafast charge migration processes in different molecular systems,\ndemonstrating its broad applicability. Convergence of the $N$-electron dynamics\nwith respect to the electronic structure theory level and basis set size is\ninvestigated. This provides an assessment of the robustness of qualitative and\nquantitative statements that can be made concerning dynamical features observed\nin charge migration simulations.\n", "  A multiplicity of quark-lepton families can naturally arise as zero-modes in\nflux compactifications. The flavour structure of quark and lepton mass matrices\nis then determined by the wave function profiles of the zero-modes. We consider\na supersymmetric $SO(10)\\times U(1)$ model in six dimensions compactified on\nthe orbifold $T^2/{\\mathbb Z_2}$ with Abelian magnetic flux. A bulk\n$\\mathbf{16}$-plet charged under the $U(1)$ provides the quark-lepton\ngenerations whereas two uncharged $\\mathbf{10}$-plets yield two Higgs doublets.\nBulk anomaly cancellation requires the presence of additional $\\mathbf{16}$-\nand $\\mathbf{10}$-plets. The corresponding zero-modes form vectorlike split\nmultiplets that are needed to obtain a successful flavour phenomenology. We\nanalyze the pattern of flavour mixings for the two heaviest families of the\nStandard Model and discuss possible generalizations to three and more\ngenerations.\n", "  Most massive stars, the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, are in close\nbinary systems and may interact with their companion through mass transfer or\nmerging. We undertake a population synthesis study to compute the delay-time\ndistribution of core-collapse supernovae, that is, the supernova rate versus\ntime following a starburst, taking into account binary interactions. We test\nthe systematic robustness of our results by running various simulations to\naccount for the uncertainties in our standard assumptions. We find that a\nsignificant fraction, $15^{+9}_{-8}$%, of core-collapse supernovae are `late',\nthat is, they occur 50-200 Myrs after birth, when all massive single stars have\nalready exploded. These late events originate predominantly from binary systems\nwith at least one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of\nintermediate mass ($4-8M_{\\odot}$). The main evolutionary channels that\ncontribute often involve either the merging of the initially more massive\nprimary star with its companion or the engulfment of the remaining core of the\nprimary by the expanding secondary that has accreted mass at an earlier\nevolutionary stage. Also, the total number of core-collapse supernovae\nincreases by $14^{+15}_{-14}$% because of binarity for the same initial stellar\nmass. The high rate implies that we should have already observed such late\ncore-collapse supernovae, but have not recognized them as such. We argue that\n$\\phi$ Persei is a likely progenitor and that eccentric neutron star - white\ndwarf systems are likely descendants. Late events can help explain the\ndiscrepancy in the delay-time distributions derived from supernova remnants in\nthe Magellanic Clouds and extragalactic type Ia events, lowering the\ncontribution of prompt Ia events. We discuss ways to test these predictions and\nspeculate on the implications for supernova feedback in simulations of galaxy\nevolution.\n", "  We discuss the next to the leading order (NLO) electroweak radiative\ncorrections to the $e^- e^+ \\rightarrow f^- f^+ (\\gamma)$ cross section\nasymmetry, for polarized and unpolarized beam scenario. The left-right and\nforward-backward amplitudes, with and without radiative corrections, are\nevaluated and compared for various kinematics. The hard bremsstrahlung is\nincluded for arbitrary energy cuts. The radiative corrections are shown to be\nsignificant and having a non-trivial dependency on the kinematic conditions.\nThe calculations are relevant for the ultra-precise low-energy experiment\nBelle~II planned at SuperKEKB.\n", "  In previous work, we derived the most general solution of the collisionless\nBoltzmann equation describing the accretion of a kinetic gas into a\nSchwarzschild black hole background, and we gave explicit expressions for the\ncorresponding observables (the current density and stress energy-momentum\ntensor) in terms of certain integrals over the distribution function. In this\narticle, we numerically compute these integrals for the particular case of the\nsteady-state, spherical symmetric accretion flows which, at infinity, are\ndescribed by an equilibrium distribution function of given temperature. We\nanalyze in detail the behavior of the observables as a function of the\ntemperature and the radial coordinate, comparing our results with the perfect\nfluid model of Bondi-Michel accretion.\n", "  The transition form factor of a gamma into three pions $F_{3\\pi}$ are studied\nin a framework of nonlocal chiral quark model. In local limit the result is\nagreement with chiral perturbative theory and reproduce Wess-Zumino-Witten\nanomaly. Availability of nonlocality not change a value of transition form\nfactor in chiral limit. On the physical threshold of reaction, the transition\nform factor $F_{3\\pi}$ is obtained close to the experimental data on account of\ncurrent mass of quark.\n", "  We show that minimizers of the Heitmann-Radin energy (R. C. Heitmann, C.\nRadin, J. Stat. Phys. 22, 281-287, 1980) are unique if and only if the particle\nnumber N belongs to an infinite sequence whose first thirty-five elements are\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 37, 40, 44, 48,\n52, 56, 61, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 91, 96, 102, 108, 114, 120 (see the paper for a\nclosed-form description of this sequence). The proof relies on the discrete\ndifferential geometry techniques introduced in (L. De Luca, G. Friesecke,\npreprint).\n", "  Ordered chains (such as chains of amino acids) are ubiquitous in biological\ncells, and these chains perform specific functions contingent on the sequence\nof their components. Using the existence and general properties of such\nsequences as a theoretical motivation, we study the statistical physics of\nsystems whose state space is defined by the possible permutations of an ordered\nlist, i.e., the symmetric group, and whose energy is a function of how certain\npermutations deviate from some chosen correct ordering. Such a non-factorizable\nstate space is quite different from the state spaces typically considered in\nstatistical physics systems and consequently has novel behavior in systems with\ninteracting and even non-interacting Hamiltonians. Various parameter choices of\na mean-field model reveal the system to contain five different physical regimes\ndefined by two transition temperatures, a triple point, and a quadruple point.\nFinally, we conclude by discussing how the general analysis can be extended to\nstate spaces with more complex combinatorial properties and to other standard\nquestions of statistical mechanics models.\n", "  We examine the moment-reconstruction performance of both the homodyne and\nheterodyne (double-homodyne) measurement schemes for arbitrary quantum states\nand introduce moment estimators that optimize the respective schemes for any\ngiven data. In the large-data limit, these estimators are as efficient as the\nmaximum-likelihood estimators. We then illustrate the superiority of the\nheterodyne measurement for the reconstruction of the first and second moments\nby analyzing Gaussian states and many other significant non-classical states.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the spectral entanglement of a multiphoton\nsource generated from the cascade emissions in the cascaded cold atomic\nensembles.\\ This photon source is highly directional, guaranteed under the\nfour-wave mixing condition, and is also highly frequency-correlated due to\nfinite driving pulse durations and superradiant decay constants.\\ We utilize\nSchmidt decomposition to study the bipartite entanglement of the biphoton\nstates projected from the multiphoton ones.\\ This entropy of entanglement can\nbe manipulated by controlling the driving parameters and superradiant decay\nrates.\\ Moreover the projected biphoton states in the cascaded scheme can have\nlarger entanglement than the one produced from only one atomic ensemble, which\nresults from larger capacity in multipartite entanglement.\\ This cascaded\nscheme enables a multiphoton source useful in quantum information processing.\\\nIt also allows for potential applications in multimode quantum communication\nand spectral shaping of high-dimensional continuous frequency entanglement.\n", "  Assuming an effective quadratic Hamiltonian, we derive an approximate, linear\nstochastic equation of motion for the density-fluctuations in liquids, composed\nof overdamped Brownian particles. From this approach, time dependent two point\ncorrelation functions (such as the intermediate scattering function) are\nderived. We show that this correlation function is exact at short times, for\nany interaction and, in particular, for arbitrary external potentials so that\nit applies to confined systems. Furthermore, we discuss the relation of this\napproach to previous ones, such as dynamical density functional theory as well\nas the formally exact treatment. This approach, inspired by the well known\nLandau-Ginzburg Hamiltonians, and the corresponding \"Model B\" equation of\nmotion, may be seen as its microscopic version, containing information about\nthe details on the particle level.\n", "  Barkhausen current noise is used to probe the slow field-driven conversion of\nthe glassy relaxor ferroelectric state to an ordered ferroelectric (FE) state.\nThe frequent presence of distinct micron-scale Barkhausen events well before\nthe polarization current starts to speed up shows that the process is not a\nconventional nucleation-limited one. The prevalence of reverse switching events\nnear the onset of the rapid part of the transition strongly indicates that\nelectric dipole interactions play a key role. The combination of Barkhausen\nnoise changes and changes in the complex dielectric response indicate that the\nprocess consists of an initial mixed-alignment domain formation stage followed\nby growth of the domains aligned with the applied field.\n", "  The type IIB matrix model is one of the most promising candidates for a\nnonperturbative formulation of superstring theory. In particular, its\nLorentzian version was shown to exhibit an interesting real-time dynamics such\nas the spontaneous breaking of the 9-dimensional rotational symmetry to the\n3-dimensional one. This result, however, was obtained after regularizing the\noriginal matrix integration by introducing \"infrared\" cutoffs on the quadratic\nmoments of the Hermitian matrices. In this paper, we generalize the form of the\ncutoffs in such a way that it involves an arbitrary power ($2p$) of the\nmatrices. By performing Monte Carlo simulation of a simplified model, we find\nthat the results become independent of $p$ and hence universal for $p \\gtrsim\n1.3$. For $p$ as large as 2.0, however, we find that large-$N$ scaling\nbehaviors do not show up, and we cannot take a sensible large-$N$ limit. Thus\nwe find that there is a certain range of $p$ in which a universal large-$N$\nlimit can be taken. Within this range of $p$, the dynamical space-time\ndimensionality turns out to be $(3+1)$, while for $p=2.0$, where we cannot take\na sensible large-$N$ limit, we observe a (5+1)d structure.\n", "  We study the nuclear modifications of full jets and their structures in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions including the effect of hydrodynamic medium\nresponse to jet quenching. To study the evolutions of the full jet shower and\nthe traversed medium with energy and momentum exchanges between them, we\nformulate a coupled jet-fluid model consisting of a set of jet transport\nequations and relativistic hydrodynamics equations with source terms. In our\nmodel, the full jet shower interacts with the medium and gets modified via\ncollisional and radiative processes during the propagation. Meanwhile, the\nenergy and momentum are deposited from the jet shower to the medium and then\nevolve with the medium hydrodynamically. The full jet defined by a cone size in\nthe final state includes the jet shower and the particles produced from\njet-induced flow. We apply our model to calculate the full jet energy loss and\nthe nuclear modifications of jet rate and shape in Pb+Pb collisions at\n$2.76{\\rm A~TeV}$. It is found that the inclusion of jet-induced flow\ncontribution leads to stronger jet-cone size dependence for jet energy loss and\njet suppression. Jet-induced flow also has a significant contribution to jet\nshape function and dominates at large angles away from the jet axis.\n", "  [Abridged] The infrared ro-vibrational emission lines from organic molecules\nin the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are unique probes of the physical\nand chemical structure of planet forming regions and the processes that shape\nthem. The non-LTE excitation effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) are studied in a\nfull disk model to evaluate: (i) what the emitting regions of the different CO2\nro-vibrational bands are; (ii) how the CO2 abundance can be best traced using\nCO2 ro-vibrational lines using future JWST data and; (iii) what the excitation\nand abundances tell us about the inner disk physics and chemistry. CO2 is a\nmajor ice component and its abundance can potentially test models with\nmigrating icy pebbles across the iceline. A full non-LTE CO2 excitation model\nhas been built. The characteristics of the model are tested using non-LTE slab\nmodels. Subsequently the CO2 line formation has been modelled using a\ntwo-dimensional disk model representative of T-Tauri disks. The CO2 gas that\nemits in the 15 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m regions of the spectrum is not in LTE and\narises in the upper layers of disks, pumped by infrared radiation. The v$_2$ 15\n$\\mu$m feature is dominated by optically thick emission for most of the models\nthat fit the observations and increases linearly with source luminosity. Its\nnarrowness compared with that of other molecules stems from a combination of\nthe low rotational excitation temperature (~250 K) and the inherently narrower\nfeature for CO2. The inferred CO2 abundances derived for observed disks are\nmore than two orders of magnitude lower than those in interstellar ices\n(~10$^5$), similar to earlier LTE disk estimates. Line-to-continuum ratios are\nlow, of order a few %, thus high signal-to-noise (S/N > 300) observations are\nneeded for individual line detections. Prospects of accurate abundance\nretreival with JWST-MIRI and JWST-NIRSpec are discussed.\n", "  Two longstanding problems in planet formation include (1) understanding how\nplanets survive migration, and (2) articulating the process by which\nprotoplanetary disks disperse---and in particular how they accrete onto their\ncentral stars. We can go a long way toward solving both problems if the disk\ngas surrounding planets has no intrinsic diffusivity (\"viscosity\"). In\ninviscid, laminar disks, a planet readily repels gas away from its orbit. On\nshort timescales, zero viscosity gas accumulates inside a planet's orbit to\nslow Type I migration by orders of magnitude. On longer timescales, multiple\nsuper-Earths (distributed between, say, $\\sim$0.1--10 AU) can torque inviscid\ngas out of interplanetary space, either inward to feed their stars, or outward\nto be blown away in a wind. We explore this picture with 2D hydrodynamics\nsimulations of Earths and super-Earths embedded in inviscid disks, confirming\ntheir slow/stalled migration even under gas-rich conditions, and showing that\ndisk transport rates range up to $\\sim$$10^{-7} M_\\odot~{\\rm yr^{-1}}$ and\nscale as $\\dot{M} \\propto \\Sigma M_{\\rm p}^{3/2}$, where $\\Sigma$ is the disk\nsurface density and $M_{\\rm p}$ is the planet mass. Gas initially sandwiched\nbetween two planets is torqued past both into the inner and outer disks. In\nsum, sufficiently compact systems of super-Earths can clear their natal disk\ngas, in a dispersal history that may be complicated and non-steady, but which\nconceivably leads over Myr timescales to large gas depletions similar to those\ncharacterizing transition disks.\n", "  We describe the electronic conductivity, as a function of the Fermi energy,\nin the Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) in presence of a random distribution of\nvacancies that simulate resonant adsorbates. We compare it to monolayer (MLG)\nwith the same defect concentrations. These transport properties are related to\nthe values of fundamental length scales such as the elastic mean free path\n$L_{e}$, the localization length $\\xi$ and the inelastic mean free path\n$L_{i}$. Usually the later, which reflect the effect of inelastic scattering by\nphonons, strongly depends on temperature $T$. In BLG an additional\ncharacteristic distance $l_1$ exists which is the typical traveling distance\nbetween two interlayer hopping events. We find that when the concentration of\ndefects is smaller than 1\\%--2\\%, one has $l_1 \\le L_e \\ll \\xi$ and the BLG has\ntransport properties that differ from those of the MLG independently of\n$L_{i}(T)$. Whereas for larger concentration of defects $L_{e} < l_1 \\ll \\xi $,\nand depending on $L_{i}(T)$, the transport in the BLG can be equivalent (or\nnot) to that of two decoupled MLG. We compare two tight-binding model\nHamiltonians with and without hopping beyond the nearest neighbors.\n", "  The aim of the present manuscript is to present a novel proposal in Geometric\nControl Theory inspired in the principles of General Relativity and\nenergy-shaping control.\n", "  We compute the x-ray emission spectrum (XES) of liquid methanol, with the\ndynamical effects that result from the creation of the core hole included in a\nsemiclassical way. Our method closely reproduces a fully quantum mechanical\ndescription of the dynamical effects for relevant one-dimensional models of the\nhydrogen-bonded methanol molecules. For the liquid we find excellent agreement\nwith the experimental spectrum, including the large isotope effect in the first\nsplit peak. The dynamical effects depend sensitively on the initial structure\nin terms of the local hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) character; non-donor\nmolecules contribute mainly to the high-energy peak while molecules with a\nstrong donated H-bond contribute to the peak at lower energy. The spectrum thus\nreflects the initial structure mediated by the dynamical effects that are,\nhowever, seen to be crucial in order to reproduce the intensity distribution of\nthe recently measured spectrum.\n", "  Freudenthal duality in N=2, D=4 ungauged supergravity is generated by an\nanti-involutive operator that acts on the electromagnetic fluxes, and results\nto be a symmetry of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We show that, with a\nsuitable extension, this duality can be generalized to the abelian gauged case\nas well, even in presence of hypermultiplets. By defining Freudenthal duality\nalong the scalar flow, one can prove that two configurations of charges and\ngaugings linked by the Freudenthal operator share the same set of values of the\nscalar fields at the black hole horizon. Consequently, Freudenthal duality is\npromoted to a nonlinear symmetry of the black hole entropy. We explicitly show\nthis invariance for the model with prepotential $F=-i X^0 X^1$ and\nFayet-Iliopoulos gauging.\n", "  We discuss a theoretical framework to define an optimal sub-grid closure for\nshell models of turbulence. The closure is based on the ansatz that consecutive\nshell multipliers are short-range correlated, following the third hypothesis of\nKolmogorov formulated for similar quantities for the original three-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes turbulence. We also propose a series of systematic approximations\nto the optimal model by assuming different degrees of correlations across\nscales among amplitudes and phases of consecutive multipliers. We show\nnumerically that such low-order closures work well, reproducing all known\nproperties of the large-scale dynamics including anomalous scaling. We found\nsmall but systematic discrepancies only for a range of scales close to the\nsub-grid threshold, which do not tend to disappear by increasing the order of\nthe approximation. We speculate that the lack of convergence might be due to a\nstructural instability, at least for the evolution of very fast degrees of\nfreedom at small scales. Connections with similar problems for Large Eddy\nSimulations of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are also\ndiscussed. Postprint version of the article published on Phys. Rev. E 95,\n043108 (2017) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.00.003100\n", "  Core-excitation effects in the scattering of two-body halo nuclei have been\ninvestigated in previous works. In particular, these effects have been found to\naffect in a significant way the breakup cross sections of neutron-halo nuclei\nwith a deformed core. To account for these effects, appropriate extensions of\nthe continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method have been recently\nproposed. We aim to extend these studies to the case of breakup reactions\nmeasured under complete kinematics or semi-inclusive reactions in which only\nthe angular or energy distribution of one of the outgoing fragments is\nmeasured. We use the standard CDCC method as well as its extended version with\ncore excitations (XCDCC), assuming a pseudo-state basis for describing the\nprojectile states. Two- and three-body observables are computed by projecting\nthe discrete two-body breakup amplitudes, obtained within these reaction\nframeworks, onto two-body scattering states with definite relative momentum of\nthe outgoing fragments and a definite state of the core nucleus. The presented\nmethod provides a tool to compute double and triple differential cross sections\nfor outgoing fragments following the breakup of a two-body projectile, and\nmight be useful to analyze breakup reactions with other deformed weakly-bound\nnuclei, for which core excitations are expected to play a role. We have found\nthat, while dynamical core excitations are important for the proton target at\nintermediate energies, they are very small for the Zn target at energies around\nthe Coulomb barrier.\n", "  We perform an extensive computational study of binary mixtures of water and\nshort-chain alcohols resorting to two-scale potential models to account for the\nsingularities of hydrogen bonded liquids. Water molecules are represented by a\nwell studied core softened potential which is known to qualitatively account\nfor a large number of water's characteristic anomalies. Along the same lines,\nalcohol molecules are idealized by dimers in which the hydroxyl groups interact\nwith each other and with water with a core softened potential as well.\nInteractions involving non-polar groups are all deemed purely repulsive. We\nfind that the qualitative behavior of excess properties (excess volume,\nenthalpy and constant pressure heat capacity) agrees with that found\nexperimentally for alcohols such as t-butanol in water. Moreover, we observe\nthat our simple solute under certain conditions acts as an \"structure-maker\",\nin the sense that the temperature of maximum density of the bulk water model\nincreases as the solute is added, i.e. the anomalous behavior of the solvent is\nenhanced by the solute.\n", "  We study the space of vacua of three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theories\nfrom a novel approach building on the type IIB brane realization of the theory\nand in which the insertion of local chiral operators in the path integral is\nobtained from integrating out light modes in appropriate brane setups. Most of\nour analysis focuses on abelian quiver theories which can be realized as the\nlow-energy theory of D3-D5-NS5 brane arrays. Their space of vacua contains a\nHiggs branch, parametrized by the vevs of half-BPS meson operators, and a\nCoulomb branch, parametrized by the vevs of half-BPS monopole operators. We\nshow that the Higgs operators are inserted by adding F1 strings and D3 branes,\nwhile the Coulomb operators are inserted by adding D1 strings and D3 branes,\nwith specific orientations, to the initial brane setup of the theory. This\napproach has two main advantages. First the ring relations describing the Higgs\nand Coulomb branches can be derived by looking at specific brane setups with\nmultiple interpretations in terms of operator insertions. This provides a new\nderivation of the Coulomb branch quantum relations. Secondly the map between\nthe Higgs and Coulomb operators of mirror dual theories is obtained in a\ntrivial way from IIB S-duality.\n", "  Data immersion has advantages in astrophysical visualization. Complex\nmulti-dimensional data and phase spaces can be explored in a seamless and\ninteractive viewing environment. Putting the user in the data is a first step\ntoward immersive data analysis. We present a technique for creating 360 degree\nspherical panoramas with astrophysical data. The three-dimensional software\npackage Blender and the Google Spatial Media module are used together to\nimmerse users in data exploration. Several examples employing these methods\nexhibit how the technique works using different types of astronomical data.\n", "  We review and develop the general properties of $L_\\infty$ algebras focusing\non the gauge structure of the associated field theories. Motivated by the\n$L_\\infty$ homotopy Lie algebra of closed string field theory and the work of\nRoytenberg and Weinstein describing the Courant bracket in this language we\ninvestigate the $L_\\infty$ structure of general gauge invariant perturbative\nfield theories. We sketch such formulations for non-abelian gauge theories,\nEinstein gravity, and for double field theory. We find that there is an\n$L_\\infty$ algebra for the gauge structure and a larger one for the full\ninteracting field theory. Theories where the gauge structure is a strict Lie\nalgebra often require the full $L_\\infty$ algebra for the interacting theory.\nThe analysis suggests that $L_\\infty$ algebras provide a classification of\nperturbative gauge invariant classical field theories.\n", "  The near-collinear expansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling is governed by the dynamics\nof stings propagating on the five sphere. The pentagon transitions in the\noperator product expansion which systematize the series get reformulated in\nterms of matrix elements of branch-point twist operators in the two-dimensional\nO(6) nonlinear sigma model. The facts that the latter is an asymptotically free\nfield theory and that there exists no local realization of twist fields\nprevents one from explicit calculation of their scaling dimensions and operator\nproduct expansion coefficients. This complication is bypassed making use of the\nequivalence of the sigma model to the infinite-level limit of WZNW models\nperturbed by current-current interactions, such that one can use conformal\nsymmetry and conformal perturbation theory for systematic calculations.\nPresently, to set up the formalism, we consider the O(3) sigma model which is\nreformulated as perturbed parafermions.\n", "  Three different noise moments of field strength, intensity, and their\ncorrelations are simultaneously measured. For this purpose a homodyne\ncross-correlation measurement [W. Vogel, Phys. Rev. A 51, 4160 (1995)] is\nimplemented by superimposing the signal field and a weak local oscillator on an\nunbalanced beam splitter. The relevant information is obtained via the\nintensity noise correlation of the output modes. Detection details like quantum\nefficiencies or uncorrelated dark noise are meaningless for our technique. Yet\nunknown insight in the quantumness of a squeezed signal field is retrieved from\nthe anomalous moment, correlating field strength with intensity noise. A\nclassical inequality including this moment is violated for almost all signal\nphases. Precognition on quantum theory is superfluous, as our analysis is\nsolely based on classical physics.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the recently proposed hybrid metric-Palatini\ngravitational theory, which consists of adding to the Einstein-Hilbert\nLagrangian an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ term constructed \\`{a} la Palatini. Using the\nrespective dynamically equivalent scalar-tensor representation, we explore the\ncosmological evolution of a specific model, given by $f(\\mathcal{R}) \\propto\n\\mathcal{R}^2$, and obtain constraints on the free parameters by using\ndifferent sources of cosmological data. The viability of the model is analysed\nby combining the conditions imposed by the Supernovae Ia and Baryonic Acoustic\nOscillations data and the results are compared with the local constraints.\n", "  The attainability of the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound [QCR], the ultimate limit\nin the precision of the estimation of a physical parameter, requires the\nsaturation of the quantum information bound [QIB]. This occurs when the Fisher\ninformation associated to a given measurement on the quantum state of a system\nwhich encodes the information about the parameter coincides with the quantum\nFisher information associated to that quantum state. Braunstein and Caves [PRL\n{\\bf 72}, 3439 (1994)] have shown that the QIB can always be achieved via a\nprojective measurement in the eigenvectors basis of an observable called\nsymmetric logarithmic derivative. However, such projective measurement depends,\nin general, on the value of the parameter to be estimated. Requiring,\ntherefore, the previous knowledge of the quantity one is trying to estimate.\nFor this reason, it is important to investigate under which situation it is\npossible to saturate the QCR without previous information about the parameter\nto be estimated. Here, we show the complete solution to the problem of which\nare all the initial pure states and the projective measurements that allow the\nglobal saturation of the QIB, without the knowledge of the true value of the\nparameter, when the information about the parameter is encoded in the system by\na unitary process.\n", "  The auto-correlation function and the frequency power spectral density due to\na super-position of uncorrelated exponential pulses are considered. These are\nshown to be independent of the degree of pulse overlap and thereby the\nintermittency of the stochastic process. For constant pulse duration and a\none-sided exponential pulse shape, the power spectral density has a Lorentzian\nshape which is flat for low frequencies and a power law at high frequencies.\nThe algebraic tail is demonstrated to result from the discontinuity in the\npulse function. For a strongly asymmetric two-sided exponential pulse shape,\nthe frequency spectrum is a broken power law with two scaling regions. In the\ncase of a symmetric pulse shape, the power spectral density is the square of a\nLorentzian function. The steep algebraic tail at high frequencies in these\ncases is demonstrated to follow from the discontinuity in the derivative of the\npulse function. A random distribution of pulse durations is shown to result in\napparently longer correlation times but has no influence on the asymptotic\npower law tail of the frequency spectrum. The effect of additional random noise\nis also discussed, leading to a flat spectrum for high frequencies. The\nprobability density function for the fluctuations is shown to be independent of\nthe distribution of pulse durations. The predictions of this model describe the\nvariety of auto-correlation functions and power spectral densities reported\nfrom experimental measurements in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined\nplasmas.\n", "  We discuss the computational performance of the adaptive resolution technique\nin molecular simulation when it is compared with equivalent full coarse-grained\nand full atomistic simulations. We show that an estimate of its efficiency,\nwithin $10-15\\%$ accuracy, is given by the Amdahl's Law adapted to the specific\nquantities involved in the problem. The derivation of the predictive formula is\ngeneral enough that it may be applied to the general case of molecular dynamics\napproaches where a reduction of degrees of freedom in a multiscale fashion\noccurs.\n", "  We study flat FLRW $\\alpha$-attractor $\\mathrm{E}$- and $\\mathrm{T}$-models\nby introducing a dynamical systems framework that yields regularized\nunconstrained field equations on two-dimensional compact state spaces. This\nresults in both illustrative figures and a complete description of the entire\nsolution spaces of these models, including asymptotics. In particular, it is\nshown that observational viability, which requires a sufficient number of\n$e$-folds, is associated with a solution given by a one-dimensional center\nmanifold of a past asymptotic de Sitter state, where the center manifold\nstructure also explains why nearby solutions are attracted to this\n`inflationary attractor solution.' A center manifold expansion yields a\ndescription of the inflationary regime with arbitrary analytic accuracy, where\nthe slow-roll approximation asymptotically describes the tangency condition of\nthe center manifold at the asymptotic de Sitter state.\n", "  We study the two-body decays of the gluino at full one-loop level in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with quark-flavour violation (QFV) in the\nsquark sector. The renormalization is done in the $\\overline{\\rm DR}$ scheme.\nThe gluon and photon radiations are included by adding the corresponding\nthree-body decay widths. We discuss the dependence of the gluino decay widths\non the QFV parameters. The main dependence stems from the $\\tilde c_R - \\tilde\nt_R$ mixing in the decays to up-type squarks, and from the $\\tilde s_R - \\tilde\nb_R$ mixing in the decays to down-type squarks due to the strong constraints\nfrom B-physics on the other quark-flavour mixing parameters. The full one-loop\ncorrections to the gluino decay widths are mostly negative and of the order of\nabout -10\\%. The QFV part stays small in the total width but can vary up to\n-8\\% for the decay width into the lightest squark. For the corresponding\nbranching ratio the effect is somehow washed out by at least a factor of two.\nThe electroweak corrections can be as large as 35\\% of the SUSY QCD\ncorrections.\n", "  The high temperature expansion (HTE) of the specific heat of a spin system\nfails at low temperatures, even if it is combined with a Pad\\'e approximation.\nOn the other hand we often have information about the low temperature\nasymptotics (LTA) of the system. Interpolation methods combine both kind of\ninformation, HTE and LTA, in order to obtain an approximation of the specific\nheat that holds for the whole temperature range. Here we revisit the entropy\nmethod that has been previously published and propose two variants that better\ncope with problems of the entropy method for gapped systems. We compare all\nthree methods applied to the antiferromagnetic Haldane spin-one chain and\nespecially apply the second variant, called Log Z method, to the cuboctahedron\nfor different spin quantum numbers. In particular, we demonstrate that the\ninterpolation method is able to detect an extra low-temperature maximum in the\nspecific heat that may appear if a separation of two energy scales is present\nin the considered system. Finally we illustrate how interpolation also works\nfor classical spin systems.\n", "  Rydberg atom-based electrometry enables traceable electric field measurements\nwith high sensitivity over a large frequency range, from gigahertz to\nterahertz. Such measurements are particularly useful for the calibration of\nradio frequency and terahertz devices, as well as other applications like near\nfield imaging of electric fields. We utilize frequency modulated spectroscopy\nwith active control of residual amplitude modulation to improve the signal to\nnoise ratio of the optical readout of Rydberg atom-based radio frequency\nelectrometry. Matched filtering of the signal is also implemented. Although we\nhave reached similarly, high sensitivity with other read-out methods, frequency\nmodulated spectroscopy is advantageous because it is well-suited for building a\ncompact, portable sensor. In the current experiment, $\\sim 3 \\mu V\ncm^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}$ sensitivity is achieved and is found to be photon shot noise\nlimited.\n", "  A network of Timepix (TPX) devices installed in the ATLAS cavern measures the\nLHC luminosity as a function of time as a stand-alone system. The data were\nrecorded from 13 TeV proton-proton collisions in 2015. Using two TPX devices,\nthe number of hits created by particles passing the pixel matrices was counted.\nA van der Meer scan of the LHC beams was analysed using bunch-integrated\nluminosity averages over the different bunch profiles for an approximate\nabsolute luminosity normalization. It is demonstrated that the TPX network has\nthe capability to measure the reduction of LHC luminosity with precision.\nComparative studies were performed among four sensors (two sensors in each TPX\ndevice) and the relative short-term precision of the luminosity measurement was\ndetermined to be 0.1% for 10 s time intervals. The internal long-term time\nstability of the measurements was below 0.5% for the data-taking period.\n", "  We record an observation about the Witten indices in two families of gauged\nlinear sigma models: the U(2) model for linear sections of Grassmannians, and\nthe U(1) model for quadric complete intersections. We describe how the Witten\nindices are related to the Euler characteristics of the singular skew-symmetric\nor symmetric determinantal varieties featuring in the analysis of their\nopposite phases, and we discuss the extent to which these relationships can be\nreconciled with standard Born-Oppenheimer arguments.\n", "  The Pixel-Imaging Mass Spectrometry (PImMS) camera allows for 3D charged\nparticle imaging measurements, in which the particle time-of-flight is recorded\nalong with $(x,y)$ position. Coupling the PImMS camera to an ultrafast\npump-probe velocity-map imaging spectroscopy apparatus therefore provides a\nroute to time-resolved multi-mass ion imaging, with both high count rates and\nlarge dynamic range, thus allowing for rapid measurements of complex\nphotofragmentation dynamics. Furthermore, the use of vacuum ultraviolet\nwavelengths for the probe pulse allows for an enhanced observation window for\nthe study of excited state molecular dynamics in small polyatomic molecules\nhaving relatively high ionization potentials. Herein, preliminary time-resolved\nmulti-mass imaging results from C$_2$F$_3$I photolysis are presented. The\nexperiments utilized femtosecond UV and VUV (160.8~nm and 267~nm) pump and\nprobe laser pulses in order to demonstrate and explore this new time-resolved\nexperimental ion imaging configuration. The data indicates the depth and power\nof this measurement modality, with a range of photofragments readily observed,\nand many indications of complex underlying wavepacket dynamics on the excited\nstate(s) prepared.\n", "  Sensory mechanisms in biology, from cells to humans, have the property of\nadaptivity, whereby the response produced by the sensor is adapted to the\noverall amplitude of the signal; reducing the sensitivity in the presence of\nstrong stimulus, while increasing it when it is weak. This property is\ninherently energy consuming and a manifestation of the non-equilibrium nature\nof living organisms. We explore here how adaptivity affects the effective\nforces that organisms feel due to others in the context of a uniform swarm,\nboth in two and three dimensions. The interactions between the individuals are\ntaken to be attractive and long-range, of power-law form. We find that the\neffects of adaptivity inside the swarm are dramatic, where the effective forces\ndecrease (or remain constant) with increasing swarm density. Linear stability\nanalysis demonstrates how this property prevents collapse (Jeans instability),\nwhen the forces are adaptive. Adaptivity therefore endows swarms with a natural\nmechanism for self-stabilization.\n", "  Quantum electron transport in side-gated graphene Hall bars is investigated\nin the presence of quantizing external magnetic fields. The asymmetric\npotential of four side-gates distorts the otherwise flat bands of the\nrelativistic Landau levels, and creates new propagating states in the Landau\nspectrum (i.e. snake states). The existence of these new states leads to an\ninteresting modification of the bend and Hall resistances, with new quantizing\nplateaus appearing in close proximity of the Landau levels. The electron\nguiding in this system can be understood by studying the current density\nprofiles of the incoming and outgoing modes. From the fact that guided\nelectrons fully transmit without any backscattering (similarly to edge states),\nwe are able to analytically predict the values of quantized resistances, and\nthey match the resistance data we obtain with our numerical (tight-binding)\nmethod. These insights in the electron guiding will be useful in predicting the\nresistances for other side-gate configurations, and possibly in other system\ngeometries, as long as there is no backscattering of the guided states.\n", "  The geometry and structure of an interface ultimately determines the behavior\nof devices at the nanoscale. We present a generic method to determine the\npossible lattice matches between two arbitrary surfaces and to calculate the\nstrain of the corresponding matched interface. We apply this method to explore\ntwo relevant classes of interfaces for which accurate structural measurements\nof the interface are available: (i) the interface between pentacene crystals\nand the (111) surface of gold, and (ii) the interface between the semiconductor\nindium-arsenide and aluminum. For both systems, we demonstrate that the\npresented method predicts interface geometries in good agreement with those\nmeasured experimentally, which present nontrivial matching characteristics and\nwould be difficult to guess without relying on automated structure-searching\nmethods.\n", "  We study heterotic backgrounds with non-trivial $H$-flux and non-vanishing\nexpectation values of fermionic bilinears, often referred to as gaugino\ncondensates. The gaugini appear in the low energy action via the\ngauge-invariant three-form bilinear $\\Sigma_{MNP}={\\rm\ntr}\\:\\bar\\chi\\Gamma_{MNP}\\chi$. For Calabi-Yau compactifications to four\ndimensions, the gaugino condensate corresponds to an internal three-form\n$\\Sigma_{mnp}$ that must be a singlet of the holonomy group. This condition\ndoes not hold anymore when an internal $H$-flux is turned on and ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha')$ effects are included. In this paper we study flux\ncompactifications to three and four-dimensions on $G$-structure manifolds. We\nderive the generic conditions for supersymmetric solutions. We use\nintegrability conditions and Lichnerowicz type arguments to derive a set of\nconstraints whose solution, together with supersymmetry, is sufficient for\nfinding backgrounds with gaugino condensate.\n", "  By means of expressing volumes in phase space in terms of traces of quantum\noperators, a relationship between the Hamiltonian poles and the Lyapunov\nexponents in a non Hermitian quantum dynamics, is presented. We illustrate the\nformalism by characterizing the behavior of the Gamow model whose dissipative\ndecay time, measured by its decoherence time, is found to be inversely\nproportional to the Lyapunov exponents of the unstable periodic orbits. The\nresults are in agreement with those obtained by means of the semiclassical\nperiodic-orbit approach in quantum resonances theory but using a simpler\nmathematics.\n", "  We use holographic correspondence to argue that Euclidean (Bunch-Davies)\nvacuum is a late-time attractor of the dynamical evolution of quantum gauge\ntheories at strong coupling. The Bunch-Davies vacuum is not an adiabatic state,\nif the gauge theory is non-conformal --- the comoving entropy production rate\nis nonzero. Using the N=2* gauge theory holography, we explore prospects of\nexplaining current accelerated expansion of the Universe as due to the vacuum\nenergy of a strongly coupled QFT.\n", "  The key feature of a thermophotovoltaic (TPV) emitter is the enhancement of\nthermal emission corresponding to energies just above the bandgap of the\nabsorbing photovoltaic cell and simultaneous suppression of thermal emission\nbelow the bandgap. We show here that a single layer plasmonic coating can\nperform this task with high efficiency. Our key design principle involves\ntuning the epsilon-near-zero frequency (plasma frequency) of the metal acting\nas a thermal emitter to the electronic bandgap of the semiconducting cell. This\napproach utilizes the change in reflectivity of a metal near its plasma\nfrequency (epsilon-near-zero frequency) to lead to spectrally selective thermal\nemission and can be adapted to large area coatings using high temperature\nplasmonic materials. We provide a detailed analysis of the spectral and angular\nperformance of high temperature plasmonic coatings as TPV emitters. We show the\npotential of such high temperature plasmonic thermal emitter coatings (p-TECs)\nfor narrowband near-field thermal emission. We also show the enhancement of\nnear-surface energy density in graphene-multilayer thermal metamaterials due to\na topological transition at an effective epsilon-near-zero frequency. This\nopens up spectrally selective thermal emission from graphene multilayers in the\ninfrared frequency regime. Our design paves the way for the development of\nsingle layer p-TECs and graphene multilayers for spectrally selective radiative\nheat transfer applications.\n", "  We report on the discovery in the LOFAR Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey\n(MSSS) of a giant radio galaxy (GRG) with a projected size of $2.56 \\pm 0.07$\nMpc projected on the sky. It is associated with the galaxy triplet UGC 9555,\nwithin which one is identified as a broad-line galaxy in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) at a redshift of $0.05453 \\pm 1 \\times 10^{-5} $, and with a\nvelocity dispersion of $215.86 \\pm 6.34$ km/s. From archival radio observations\nwe see that this galaxy hosts a compact flat-spectrum radio source, and we\nconclude that it is the active galactic nucleus (AGN) responsible for\ngenerating the radio lobes. The radio luminosity distribution of the jets, and\nthe broad-line classification of the host AGN, indicate this GRG is orientated\nwell out of the plane of the sky, making its physical size one of the largest\nknown for any GRG. Analysis of the infrared data suggests that the host is a\nlenticular type galaxy with a large stellar mass\n($\\log~\\mathrm{M}/\\mathrm{M}_\\odot = 11.56 \\pm 0.12$), and a moderate star\nformation rate ($1.2 \\pm 0.3~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot/\\mathrm{year}$). Spatially\nsmoothing the SDSS images shows the system around UGC 9555 to be significantly\ndisturbed, with a prominent extension to the south-east. Overall, the evidence\nsuggests this host galaxy has undergone one or more recent moderate merger\nevents and is also experiencing tidal interactions with surrounding galaxies,\nwhich have caused the star formation and provided the supply of gas to trigger\nand fuel the Mpc-scale radio lobes.\n", "  To obtain more precise parton distribution functions (PDFs) it is important\nto include data on inclusive high transverse energy jet production in the\nglobal parton analyses. These data have high statistics and the NNLO terms in\nthe perturbative QCD (pQCD) description are now available. Our aim is to reduce\nthe uncertainty in the comparison of the jet data with pQCD. To ensure the best\nconvergence of the pQCD series it is important to choose the appropriate\nfactorization scales, $\\mu_F$. We show that it is possible to absorb and resum\nin the incoming PDFs and fragmentation function ($D$) an essential part of the\nhigher $\\alpha_s$ order corrections by determining the `optimal' values of\n$\\mu_F$. We emphasize that it is necessary to optimize different factorization\nscales for the various factors in the cross section: indeed, both of the PDFs,\nand also the fragmentation function, have their own optimal scale. We show how\nthe values of these scales can be calculated for the LO (NLO) part of the pQCD\nprediction of the cross section based on the theoretically known NLO (NNLO)\ncorrections. After these scales are fixed at their optimal values, the residual\nfactorization scale dependence is much reduced.\n", "  The cornerstone mission Gaia, together with complementary surveys, will\nrevolutionize our understanding of the formation and history of our Galaxy,\nproviding accurate stellar masses, radii, ages, distances, as well as chemical\nproperties for a very large sample of stars across different Galactic stellar\npopulations.Using an improved population synthesis approach and new stellar\nevolution models we attempt to evaluate the possibility of deriving ages and\nmasses of clump stars from their chemical properties.A new version of the\nBesancon Galaxy model (BGM) uses new stellar evolutionary tracks computed with\nSTAREVOL.These provide chemical and seismic properties from the PMS to the\nearly-AGB.For the first time, the BGM can explore the effects of an\nextra-mixing occurring in red-giant stars.In particular we focus on the effects\nof thermohaline instability on chemical properties as well as on the\ndetermination of stellar ages and masses using the surface [C/N] abundance\nratio.The impact of extra-mixing on 3He, 12C/13C, N, and [C/N] abundances along\nthe giant branch is quantified.We underline the crucial contribution of\nasteroseismology to discriminate between evolutionary states of field giants\nbelonging to the Galactic disc.The inclusion of thermohaline instability has a\nsignificant impact on 12C/13C,3He as well as on the [C/N] values.We show the\nefficiency of thermohaline mixing at different metallicities and its influence\non the determined stellar mass and age from the observed [C/N] ratio.We then\npropose simple relations to determine ages and masses from chemical abundances\naccording to these models.We emphasize the usefulness of population synthesis\ntools to test stellar models and transport processes inside stars.We show that\ntransport processes occurring in red-giant stars should be taken into account\nin the determination of ages for future Galactic archaeology studies.(abridged)\n", "  In this paper, we study the fully developed gravity-driven flow of granular\nmaterials between two inclined planes. We assume that the granular materials\ncan be represented by a modified form of the second-grade fluid where the\nviscosity depends on the shear rate and volume fraction and the normal stress\ncoefficients depend on the volume fraction. We also propose a new isotropic\n(spherical) part of the stress tensor which can be related to the compactness\nof the (rigid) particles. This new term ensures that the rigid solid particles\ncannot be compacted beyond a point, namely when the volume fraction has reached\nthe critical/maximum packing value. The numerical results indicate that the\nnewly proposed stress tensor has an obvious and physically meaningful effects\non both the velocity and the volume fraction fields.\n", "  We propose a novel mechanism which explains cored dark matter density profile\nin recently observed dark matter rich dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In our\nscenario, dark matter particle mass decreases gradually as function of distance\ntowards the center of a dwarf galaxy due to its interaction with a chameleon\nscalar. At closer distance towards galactic center the strength of attractive\nscalar fifth force becomes much stronger than gravity and is balanced by the\nFermi pressure of dark matter cloud, thus an equilibrium static configuration\nof dark matter halo is obtained. Like the case of soliton star or fermion\nQ-star, the stability of the dark matter halo is obtained as the scalar\nachieves a static profile and reaches an asymptotic value away from the\ngalactic center. For simple scalar-dark matter interaction and quadratic scalar\nself interaction potential, we show that dark matter behaves exactly like cold\ndark matter (CDM) beyond few $\\rm{kpc}$ away from galactic center but at closer\ndistance it becomes lighter and fermi pressure cannot be ignored anymore. Using\nThomas-Fermi approximation, we numerically solve the radial static profile of\nthe scalar field, fermion mass and dark matter energy density as a function of\ndistance. We find that for fifth force mediated by an ultra light scalar, it is\npossible to obtain a flattened dark matter density profile towards galactic\ncenter. In our scenario, the fifth force can be neglected at distance $ r \\geq\n1\\, \\rm{kpc}$ from galactic center and dark matter can be simply treated as\nheavy non-relativistic particles beyond this distance, thus reproducing the\nsuccess of CDM at large scales.\n", "  Cosmography, the study and making of maps of the universe or cosmos, is a\nfield where visual representation benefits from modern three-dimensional\nvisualization techniques and media. At the extragalactic distance scales,\nvisualization is contributing in understanding the complex structure of the\nlocal universe, in terms of spatial distribution and flows of galaxies and dark\nmatter. In this paper, we report advances in the field of extragalactic\ncosmography obtained using the SDvision visualization software in the context\nof the Cosmicflows Project. Here, multiple visualization techniques are applied\nto a variety of data products: catalogs of galaxy positions and galaxy peculiar\nvelocities, reconstructed velocity field, density field, gravitational\npotential field, velocity shear tensor viewed in terms of its eigenvalues and\neigenvectors, envelope surfaces enclosing basins of attraction. These\nvisualizations, implemented as high-resolution images, videos, and interactive\nviewers, have contributed to a number of studies: the cosmography of the local\npart of the universe, the nature of the Great Attractor, the discovery of the\nboundaries of our home supercluster of galaxies Laniakea, the mapping of the\ncosmic web, the study of attractors and repellers.\n", "  The types of instability in the interacting binary stars are reviewed. The\nproject \"Inter-Longitude Astronomy\" is a series of smaller projects on concrete\nstars or groups of stars. It has no special funds, and is supported from\nresources and grants of participating organizations, when informal working\ngroups are created. Totally we studied 1900+ variable stars of different types.\nThe characteristic timescale is from seconds to decades and (extrapolating)\neven more. The monitoring of the first star of our sample AM Her was initiated\nby Prof. V.P. Tsesevich (1907-1983). Since more than 358 ADS papers were\npublished. Some highlights of our photometric and photo-polarimetric monitoring\nand mathematical modelling of interacting binary stars of different types are\npresented: classical, asynchronous, intermediate polars and magnetic dwarf\nnovae (DO Dra) with 25 timescales corresponding to different physical\nmechanisms and their combinations (part \"Polar\"); negative and positive\nsuperhumpers in nova-like and many dwarf novae stars (\"Superhumper\"); eclipsing\n\"non-magnetic\" cataclysmic variables; symbiotic systems (\"Symbiosis\");\nsuper-soft sources (SSS, QR And); spotted (and not spotted) eclipsing variables\nwith (and without) evidence for a current mass transfer (\"Eclipser\") with a\nspecial emphasis on systems with a direct impact of the stream into the gainer\nstar's atmosphere, or V361 Lyr-type stars. Other parts of the ILA project are\n\"Stellar Bell\" (interesting pulsating variables of different types and periods\n- M, SR, RV Tau, RR Lyr, Delta Sct) and \"Novice\"(=\"New Variable\") discoveries\nand classification with a subsequent monitoring for searching and studying\npossible multiple components of variability. Special mathematical methods have\nbeen developed to create a set of complementary software for statistically\noptimal modelling of variable stars of different types.\n", "  We derive the gaugeon formalism of the Kalb-Ramond field theory, a reducible\ngauge theory, which discusses the quantum gauge freedom. In gaugeon formalism,\ntheory admits quantum gauge symmetry which leaves the action form-invariant.\nThe BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism is also studied which introduces the\ngaugeon ghost fields and gaugeon ghosts of ghosts fields. To replace the\nYokoyama subsidiary conditions by a single Kugo-Ojima type condition the virtue\nof BRST symmetry is utilized. Under generalized BRST transformations, we show\nthat the gaugeon fields appear naturally in the reducible gauge theory.\n", "  The Kepler mission has discovered that multiple close-in super-Earth planets\nare common around solar-type stars, but their period ratios do not show strong\npile-ups near mean motion resonances (MMRs). One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich\nstage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their\norbits, moving them out of resonance.\n", "  The formation of Mn-Cr-Ni-Si dodecagonal quasicrystal has been studied at 600\nand 700 C. The growth process of the quasicrystal from as-cast beta-Mn phase\nwas explained by Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation. In order to evaluate structural\nquality of the quasicrystal, distortion in the diffraction pattern observed\nalong the 12-fold axis was analyzed. This analysis indicated that the aging at\n600 C for 100 h is the best condition to synthesize the quasicrystal.\n", "  A study of the intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces\nwith boundary was recently initiated in a work of R. Pandharipande, J. P.\nSolomon and the third author, where they introduced open intersection numbers\nin genus 0. Their construction was later generalized to all genera by J. P.\nSolomon and the third author. In this paper we consider a refinement of the\nopen intersection numbers by distinguishing contributions from surfaces with\ndifferent numbers of boundary components, and we calculate all these numbers.\nWe then construct a matrix model for the generating series of the refined open\nintersection numbers and conjecture that it is equivalent to the\nKontsevich-Penner matrix model. An evidence for the conjecture is presented.\nAnother refinement of the open intersection numbers, which describes the\ndistribution of the boundary marked points on the boundary components, is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Nuclear thermodynamics studies evidenced the existence of a first order phase\ntransition, namely of the liquid-gas type, without paying attention to the\nisospin degree of freedom. On the other hand, only few results with the\nintroduction of the isospin variable have been so far obtained. Moreover above\nall a key question remains. It concerns the origin of the dynamics of the phase\ntransition: spinodal instabilities or not with possible consequences and new\nsignatures related to the introduction of the isospin variable.\n", "  We introduce a Dirac operator $D$ for the quantum group\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, as an element of the tensor product of\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ with the Clifford algebra on two generators. We study\nthe properties of $D$, including an analogue of Vogan's conjecture. We compute\nthe cohomology of $D$ acting on various $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules.\n", "  Using the formalism of the classical nucleation theory, we derive an\nexpression for the reversible work $W_*$ of formation of a binary crystal\nnucleus in a liquid binary solution of non-stoichiometric composition\n(incongruent crystallization). Applied to the crystallization of aqueous nitric\nacid (NA) droplets, the new expression more adequately takes account of the\neffect of nitric acid vapor compared to the conventional expression of\nMacKenzie, Kulmala, Laaksonen, and Vesala (MKLV) [J.Geophys.Res. 102, 19729\n(1997)]. The predictions of both MKLV and modified expressions for the average\nliquid-solid interfacial tension $\\sigma^{ls}$ of nitric acid dihydrate (NAD)\ncrystals are compared by using existing experimental data on the incongruent\ncrystallization of aqueous NA droplets of composition relevant to polar\nstratospheric clouds (PSCs). The predictions based on the MKLV expression are\nhigher by about 5% compared to predictions based on our modified expression.\nThis results in similar differences between the predictions of both expressions\nfor the solid-vapor interfacial tension $\\sigma^{sv}$ of NAD crystal nuclei.\nThe latter can be obtained by analyzing of experimental data on crystal\nnucleation rates in aqueous NA droplets and exploiting the dominance of the\nsurface-stimulated mode of crystal nucleation in small droplets and its\nnegligibility in large ones. Applying that method, our expression for $W_*$\nprovides an estimate for $\\sigma^{sv}$ of NAD in the range from 92 dyn/cm to\n100 dyn/cm, while the MKLV expression predicts it in the range from 95 dyn/cm\nto 105 dyn/cm. The predictions of both expressions for $W_*$ become identical\nin the case of congruent crystallization; this was also demonstrated by\napplying our method to the nucleation of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) crystals\nin PSC droplets of stoichiometric composition.\n", "  The Montage Image Mosaic Engine was designed as a scalable toolkit, written\nin C for performance and portability across *nix platforms, that assembles FITS\nimages into mosaics. The code is freely available and has been widely used in\nthe astronomy and IT communities for research, product generation and for\ndeveloping next-generation cyber-infrastructure. Recently, it has begun to\nfinding applicability in the field of visualization. This has come about\nbecause the toolkit design allows easy integration into scalable systems that\nprocess data for subsequent visualization in a browser or client. And it\nincludes a visualization tool suitable for automation and for integration into\nPython: mViewer creates, with a single command, complex multi-color images\noverlaid with coordinate displays, labels, and observation footprints, and\nincludes an adaptive image histogram equalization method that preserves the\nstructure of a stretched image over its dynamic range. The Montage toolkit\ncontains functionality originally developed to support the creation and\nmanagement of mosaics but which also offers value to visualization: a\nbackground rectification algorithm that reveals the faint structure in an\nimage; and tools for creating cutout and down-sampled versions of large images.\nVersion 5 of Montage offers support for visualizing data written in HEALPix\nsky-tessellation scheme, and functionality for processing and organizing images\nto comply with the TOAST sky-tessellation scheme required for consumption by\nthe World Wide Telescope (WWT). Four online tutorials enable readers to\nreproduce and extend all the visualizations presented in this paper.\n", "  In spite of recent advances in field delineation methods, bibliometricians\nstill don't know the extent to which their topic detection algorithms\nreconstruct `ground truths', i.e. thematic structures in the scientific\nliterature. In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to the delineation of\nthematic structures that attempts to match the algorithm to theoretically\nderived and empirically observed properties all thematic structures have in\ncommon. We cluster citation links rather than publication nodes, use\npredominantly local information and search for communities of links starting\nfrom seed subgraphs in order to allow for pervasive overlaps of topics. We\nevaluate sets of links with a new cost function and assume that local minima in\nthe cost landscape correspond to link communities. Because this cost landscape\nhas many local minima we define a valid community as the community with the\nlowest minimum within a certain range. Since finding all valid communities is\nimpossible for large networks, we designed a memetic algorithm that combines\nprobabilistic evolutionary strategies with deterministic local searches. We\napply our approach to a network of about 15,000 Astronomy & Astrophysics papers\npublished 2010 and their cited sources, and to a network of about 100,000\nAstronomy & Astrophysics papers (published 2003--2010) which are linked through\ndirect citations.\n", "  We write down the four-dimensional fully differential decay distribution for\nthe top quark decay $t \\to Wb \\to \\ell \\nu b$. We discuss how its eight\nphysical parameters can be measured, either with a global fit or with the use\nof selected one-dimensional distributions and asymmetries. We give expressions\nfor the top decay amplitudes for a general $tbW$ interaction, and show how the\nuntangled measurement of the two components of the fraction of longitudinal $W$\nbosons - those with $b$ quark helicities of $1/2$ and $-1/2$, respectively -\ncould improve the precision of a global fit to the $tbW$ vertex.\n", "  Quantum fluctuations in the phase and amplitude quadratures of light set\nlimitations on the sensitivity of modern optical instruments. The sensitivity\nof the interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO), is limited by quantum\nshot noise, quantum radiation pressure noise, and a set of classical noises. We\nshow how the quantum properties of light can be used to distinguish these\nnoises using correlation techniques. Particularly, in the first part of the\npaper we show estimations of the coating thermal noise and gas phase noise,\nhidden below the quantum shot noise in the Advanced LIGO sensitivity curve. We\nalso make projections on the observatory sensitivity during the next science\nruns. In the second part of the paper we discuss the correlation technique that\nreveals the quantum radiation pressure noise from the background of classical\nnoises and shot noise. We apply this technique to the Advanced LIGO data,\ncollected during the first science run, and experimentally estimate the quantum\ncorrelations and quantum radiation pressure noise in the interferometer for the\nfirst time.\n", "  The determination of $|V_{us}|$ from kaon semileptonic decays requires the\nvalue of the form factor $f_+(q^2=0)$ which can be calculated precisely on the\nlattice. We provide the one-loop partially quenched chiral perturbation theory\nexpressions both with and without including the effects of staggered quarks for\nall form factors at finite volume and with partially twisted boundary\nconditions for both the vector current and scalar density matrix elements at\nall $q^2$. We point out that at finite volume there are more form factors than\njust $f_+$ and $f_-$ for the vector current matrix element but that the Ward\nidentity is fully satisfied. The size of the finite-volume corrections at\npresent lattice sizes is small. This will help improve the lattice\ndetermination of $f_+(q^2=0)$ since the finite-volume error is the dominant\nerror source for some calculations. The size of the finite-volume corrections\nmay be estimated on a single lattice ensemble by comparing results for various\ntwist choices.\n", "  We present nonlocal integrable reductions of the Fordy-Kulish system of\nnonlinear Schrodinger equations and the Fordy system of derivative nonlinear\nSchrodinger equations on Hermitian symmetric spaces. Examples are given on the\nsymmetric space $\\frac{SU(4)}{SU(2) \\times SU(2)}$.\n", "  The presence of terms that violate quark-hadron duality in the expansion of\nQCD Green's functions is a generally accepted fact. Recently, a new approach\nwas proposed for the study of duality violations (DVs), which exploits the\nexistence of a rigorous lower bound on the functional distance, measured in a\ncertain norm, between a \"true\" correlator and its approximant calculated\ntheoretically along a contour in the complex energy plane. In the present paper\nwe pursue the investigation of functional-analysis based tests towards their\napplication to real spectral function data. We derive a closed analytic\nexpression for the minimal functional distance based on the general weighted\n$L^2$ norm and discuss its relation with the distance measured in $L^\\infty$\nnorm. Using fake data sets obtained from a realistic toy model in which we\nallow for covariances inspired from the publicly available ALEPH spectral\nfunctions, we obtain by Monte Carlo simulations the statistical distribution of\nthe strength parameter that measures the magnitude of the DV term added to the\nusual operator product expansion (OPE). The results show that, if the region\nwith large errors near the end-point of the spectrum in $\\tau$ decays is\nexcluded, the functional-analysis based tests using either $L^2$ or $L^\\infty$\nnorms are able to detect, in a statistically significant way, the presence of\nDVs in realistic spectral function pseudodata.\n", "  The dynamics of a circular thin vortex ring and a sphere moving along the\nsymmetry axis of the ring in an inviscid incompressible fluid is studied on the\nbasis of Euler's equations of motion. The equations of motion for position and\nradius of the vortex ring and those for position and velocity of the sphere are\ncoupled by hydrodynamic interactions. The equations are cast in Hamiltonian\nform, from which it is seen that total energy and momentum are conserved. The\nfour Hamiltonian equations of motion are solved numerically for a variety of\ninitial conditions.\n", "  We introduce The Fabric of the Universe, an art and science collaboration\nfocused on exploring the cosmic web of dark matter with unconventional\ntechniques and materials. We discuss two of our projects in detail. First, we\ndescribe a pipeline for translating three-dimensional (3D) density structures\nfrom N-body simulations into solid surfaces suitable for 3D printing, and\npresent prints of a cosmological volume and of the infall region around a\nmassive cluster halo. In these models, we discover wall-like features that are\ninvisible in two-dimensional projections. Going beyond the sheer visualization\nof simulation data, we undertake an exploration of the cosmic web as a\nthree-dimensional woven textile. To this end, we develop experimental 3D\nweaving techniques to create sphere-like and filamentary shapes and radically\nsimplify a region of the cosmic web into a set of filaments and halos. We\ntranslate the resulting tree structure into a series of commands that can be\nexecuted by a digital weaving machine, and present a large-scale textile\ninstallation.\n", "  Half-metallic properties of TlCrS2, TlCrSe2 and hypothetical TlCrSSe have\nbeen investigated by first-principles all-electron full-potential linearized\naugmented plane wave plus local orbital (FP-LAPW+lo) method based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT). The results of calculations show that TlCrS2 and\nTlCrSSe are half-metals with energy gap (Eg ) ~0.12 ev for spin-down channel.\nStrong hybridization of p-state of chalchogen and d-state of Cr leads to\nbonding and antibonding states and subsequently to the appearance of a gap in\nspin-down channel of TlCrS2 and TlCrSSe. In the case of TlCrSe2, there is a\npartial hybridization and p-state is partially present in the DOS at Fermi\nlevel making this compound nearly half- metallic. The present calculations\nrevealed that total magnetic moment keeps its integer value on a relatively\nwide range of changes in volume (-10% 10%) for TlCrS2 and TlCrSSe, while total\nmagnetic moment of TlCrSe2 decreases with increasing volume approaching to\ninteger value 3{\\mu}B.\n", "  Path integrals for particles in curved spaces can be used to compute trace\nanomalies in quantum field theories, and more generally to study properties of\nquantum fields coupled to gravity in first quantization. While their\nconstruction in arbitrary coordinates is well understood, and known to require\nthe use of a regularization scheme, in this article we take up an old proposal\nof constructing the path integral by using Riemann normal coordinates. The\nmethod assumes that curvature effects are taken care of by a scalar effective\npotential, so that the particle lagrangian is reduced to that of a linear sigma\nmodel interacting with the effective potential. After fixing the correct\neffective potential, we test the construction on spaces of maximal symmetry and\nuse it to compute heat kernel coefficients and type-A trace anomalies for a\nscalar field in arbitrary dimensions up to d=12. The results agree with\nexpected ones, which are reproduced with great efficiency and extended to\nhigher orders. We prove explicitly the validity of the simplified path integral\non maximally symmetric spaces. This simplified path integral might be of\nfurther use in worldline applications, though its application on spaces of\narbitrary geometry remains unclear.\n", "  New tools are needed to handle the growth of data in astrophysics delivered\nby recent and upcoming surveys. We aim to build open-source, light, flexible,\nand interactive software designed to visualize extensive three-dimensional (3D)\ntabular data. Entirely written in the Python language, we have developed\ninteractive tools to browse and visualize the positions of galaxies in the\nuniverse and their positions with respect to its large-scale structures (LSS).\nMotivated by a previous study, we created two codes using Mollweide projection\nand wedge diagram visualizations, where survey galaxies can be overplotted on\nthe LSS of the universe. These are interactive representations where the\nvisualizations can be controlled by widgets. We have released these open-source\ncodes that have been designed to be easily re-used and customized by the\nscientific community to fulfill their needs. The codes are adaptable to other\nkinds of 3D tabular data and are robust enough to handle several millions of\nobjects.\n", "  We report about the magnetic properties of antiferromagnetic (AF) MnO\nnanoparticles (NPs) with different sizes (6-19nm). Using a combination of\npolarized neutron scattering and magnetometry we were able to resolve\npreviously observed peculiarities. Magnetometry, on the one hand, reveals a\npeak in the zero field cooled (ZFC) magnetization curves at low temperatures\n(~25K) but no feature around the N\\'eel temperature at 118K. On the other hand,\npolarized neutron scattering shows the expected behavior of the AF order\nparameter vanishing around 118K. Moreover, hysteresis curves measured at\nvarious temperatures reveal an exchange bias effect indicating a coupling of an\nAF core to a ferromagnetic (FM)-like shell. ZFC data measured at various fields\nexclude a purely superparamagnetic (SPM) scenario. We conclude that the\nmagnetic behavior of MnO particles can be explained by a superposition of\nSPM-like thermal fluctuations of the AF-N\\'eel vector inside the AF core and a\nstrong magnetic coupling to a ferrimagnetic Mn$_2$O$_3$ or Mn$_3$O$_4$ shell.\nIn addition, we have studied heterodimer ('Janus') particles, where a FM FePt\nparticle is attached to the AF MnO particle. Via the exchange bias effect, the\nmagnetic moment of the FePt subunit is stabilized by the MnO.\n", "  In a recent publication [6], the Belle collaboration updated their analysis\nof the inclusive weak radiative B-meson decay, including the full dataset of\n(772 +_ 11) x 10^6 BBbar pairs. Their result for the branching ratio is now\nbelow the Standard Model prediction [7,8], though it remains consistent with\nit. However, bounds on the charged Higgs boson mass in the Two-Higgs-Doublet\nModel get affected in a significant manner. In the so-called Model-II, the 95%\nC.L. lower bound on $M_{H^\\pm}$ is now in the 570-800 GeV range, depending\nquite sensitively on the method applied for its determination. Our present note\nis devoted to presenting and discussing the updated bounds, as well as to\nclarifying several ambiguities that one might encounter in evaluating them. One\nof such ambiguities stems from the photon energy cutoff choice, which deserves\nre-consideration in view of the improved experimental accuracy.\n", "  Using Lindblad dynamics we study quantum spin systems with dissipative\nboundary dynamics that generate a stationary nonequilibrium state with a\nnon-vanishing spin current that is locally conserved except at the boundaries.\nWe demonstrate that with suitably chosen boundary target states one can solve\nthe many-body Lindblad equation exactly in any dimension. As solution we obtain\npure states at any finite value of the dissipation strength and any system\nsize. They are characterized by a helical stationary magnetization profile and\na superdiffusive ballistic current of order one, independent of system size\neven when the quantum spin system is not integrable. These results are derived\nin explicit form for the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain and its\nhigher-spin generalizations (which include for spin-1 the integrable\nZamolodchikov-Fateev model and the bi-quadratic Heisenberg chain). The\nextension of the results to higher dimensions is straightforward.\n", "  de Haas-van Alphen oscillation spectrum of two-dimensional systems is studied\nfor general power law energy dispersion, yielding a Fermi surface area of the\nform $S(E)\\propto E^\\alpha$ for a given energy $E$. The case $\\alpha=1$ stands\nfor the parabolic energy dispersion. It is demonstrated that the periodicity of\nthe magnetic oscillations in inverse field can depend notably on the\ntemperature. We evaluated analytically the Fourier spectrum of these\noscillations to evidence the frequency shift and smearing of the main peak\nstructure as the temperature increases.\n", "  The physical properties of brown dwarf discs, in terms of their shapes and\nsizes, are still largely unexplored by observations. To what extent brown dwarf\ndiscs are similar to scaled-down T Tauri discs is currently unknown, and this\nwork is a step towards establishing a relationship through the eventual\nmodelling of future observations.\n  We use observations of the brown dwarf disc $\\rho$ Oph 102 to infer a\nfiducial model around which we build a small grid of brown dwarf disc models,\nin order to model the CO, HCN, and HCO+ line fluxes and the chemistry which\ndrives their abundances. These are the first brown dwarf models to be published\nwhich relate detailed, 2D radiation thermochemical disc models to observational\ndata.\n  We predict that moderately extended ALMA antenna configurations will\nspatially resolve CO line emission around brown dwarf discs, and that HCN and\nHCO+ will be detectable in integrated flux, following our conclusion that the\nflux ratios of these molecules to CO emission are comparable to that of T Tauri\ndiscs. These molecules have not yet been observed in sub-mm wavelengths in a\nbrown dwarf disc, yet they are crucial tracers of the warm surface-layer gas\nand of ionization in the outer parts of the disc.\n  We present the prediction that if the physical and chemical processes in\nbrown dwarf discs are similar to those that occur in T Tauri discs -- as our\nmodels suggest -- then the same diagnostics that are used for T Tauri discs can\nbe used for brown dwarf discs (such as HCN and HCO+ lines that have not yet\nbeen observed in the sub-mm), and that these lines should be observable with\nALMA. Through future observations, either confirmation (or refutation) of these\nideas about brown dwarf disc chemistry will have strong implications for our\nunderstanding of disc chemistry, structure, and subsequent planet formation in\nbrown dwarf discs.\n", "  This is the first part of an oral history interview on the lifelong\ninvolvement of Joel Lebowitz in the development of statistical mechanics. Here\nthe covered topics include the formative years, which overlapped the tragic\nperiod of Nazi power and World War II in Europe, the emigration to the United\nStates in 1946 and the schooling there. It also includes the beginnings and\nearly scientific works with Peter Bergmann, Oliver Penrose and many others. The\nsecond part will appear in a forthcoming issue of European Physical Journal H.\n", "  In this data-rich era of astronomy, there is a growing reliance on automated\ntechniques to discover new knowledge. The role of the astronomer may change\nfrom being a discoverer to being a confirmer. But what do astronomers actually\nlook at when they distinguish between \"sources\" and \"noise?\" What are the\ndifferences between novice and expert astronomers when it comes to visual-based\ndiscovery? Can we identify elite talent or coach astronomers to maximize their\npotential for discovery? By looking to the field of sports performance\nanalysis, we consider an established, domain-wide approach, where the expertise\nof the viewer (i.e. a member of the coaching team) plays a crucial role in\nidentifying and determining the subtle features of gameplay that provide a\nwinning advantage. As an initial case study, we investigate whether the\nSportsCode performance analysis software can be used to understand and document\nhow an experienced HI astronomer makes discoveries in spectral data cubes. We\nfind that the process of timeline-based coding can be applied to spectral cube\ndata by mapping spectral channels to frames within a movie. SportsCode provides\na range of easy to use methods for annotation, including feature-based codes\nand labels, text annotations associated with codes, and image-based drawing.\nThe outputs, including instance movies that are uniquely associated with coded\nevents, provide the basis for a training program or team-based analysis that\ncould be used in unison with discipline specific analysis software. In this\ncoordinated approach to visualization and analysis, SportsCode can act as a\nvisual notebook, recording the insight and decisions in partnership with\nestablished analysis methods. Alternatively, in situ annotation and coding of\nfeatures would be a valuable addition to existing and future visualisation and\nanalysis packages.\n", "  The effect of core excitations in transfer reactions of the form A(d, p)B has\nbeen found to affect significantly the calculated cross sections and to depend\nstrongly and non-linearly on the incident deuteron energy in Faddeev/AGS\ncalculations. Our goal is to investigate these effects within a\ncoupled-channels formulation of the scattering problem which, in addition of\nbeing computationally less demanding than the Faddeev counterpart, may help\nshed some light into the physical interpretation of the cited effects. We use\nan extended version of the continuum-discretized coupled-channels (CDCC) method\nwith explicit inclusion of target excitations within a coupled-channels Born\napproximation (CDCC-BA) formulation of the transfer transition amplitude. We\ncompare the calculated transfer cross sections with those obtained with an\nanalogous calculation omitting the effect of target excitation. We consider\nalso an adiabatic coupled channels (ACC) method. Our working example is the 10\nBe(d,p) 11 Be reaction. We find that both formalisms are able to reproduce the\neffects of deformation found in Faddeev calculations, whose origin stems from\nthe interference of the direct one-step transfer, and the two-step transfer\nfollowing target excitation.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of identifying invisible objects (e.g. dark\nmatter) via missing mass in Central Exclusive Processes; that is, in events\nwhere only forward protons are detected at the LHC. We show that the signal\nmust have a cross section greater than 0.25 fb in order that it can be\ndetected. We estimate the huge background caused by soft proton dissociation\nand evaluate the requirements of the detector `veto' system needed to\nsufficiently suppress these events. In addition, we discuss the related process\nleading to the possible identification of the particles from the so-called\n`compressed-mass Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)' scenarios. In this case the\nbackground is not so severe.\n", "  Using a macroscopic approach, we studied theoretically the heat generation in\na typical spin valve with nonmagnetic spacer layer of finite thickness. Our\nanalysis shows that the spin-dependent heat generation cannot be interpreted as\nthe Joule heating of the spin-coupled interface resistance except for some\nspecial segments. Moreover, the spin-coupled interface resistance can be\nnegative in certain situation, and thus its \"Joule heating\" should be\nunderstood instead as the work done by the extra field in the ferromagnetic\nlayers and at the spin-selective interfaces. Effective resistances are proposed\nas alternatives so that the spin-dependent heat generation can still be\nexpressed in a form resembling Joule's law.\n", "  We introduce generalized versions of complex Scarf and Morse-type potentials\nthat con- tain energy-dependent parameters. PT -symmetry and pseudo-hermiticity\nof the associated quantum systems are discussed, and a modified orthogonality\nrelation and pseudo-norm are constructed. We show that despite\nenergy-dependence, our systems can admit real energy spectra and normalizable\nsolutions of bound-state type.\n", "  Hyperbolic (or indefinite) materials have attracted significant attention due\nto their unique capabilities for engineering electromagnetic space and\ncontrolling light propagation. A current challenge is to find a hyperbolic\nmaterial with wide working frequency window, low energy loss, and easy\ncontrollability. Here, we propose that naturally existing electride materials\ncould serve as high-performance hyperbolic medium. Taking the electride Ca$_2$N\nas a concrete example and using first-principles calculations, we show that the\nmaterial is hyperbolic over a wide frequency window from short-wavelength to\nnear infrared. More importantly, it is almost lossless in the window. We\nclarify the physical origin of these remarkable properties, and show its\nall-angle negative refraction effect. Moreover, we find that the optical\nproperties can be effectively tuned by strain. With moderate strain, the\nmaterial can even be switched between elliptic and hyperbolic for a particular\nfrequency. Our result points out a new route toward high-performance natural\nhyperbolic materials, and it offers realistic materials and novel methods to\nachieve controllable hyperbolic dispersion with great potential for\napplications.\n", "  The one-dimensional symmetric exclusion process, the simplest interacting\nparticle process, is a lattice-gas made of particles that hop symmetrically on\na discrete line respecting hard-core exclusion. The system is prepared on the\ninfinite lattice with a step initial profile with average densities $\\rho_{+}$\nand $\\rho_{-}$ on the right and on the left of the origin. When $\\rho_{+} =\n\\rho_{-}$, the gas is at equilibrium and undergoes stationary fluctuations.\nWhen these densities are unequal, the gas is out of equilibrium and will remain\nso forever. A tracer, or a tagged particle, is initially located at the\nboundary between the two domains; its position $X_t$ is a random observable in\ntime, that carries information on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the whole\nsystem. We derive an exact formula for the cumulant generating function and the\nlarge deviation function of $X_t$, in the long time limit, and deduce the full\nstatistical properties of the tracer's position. The equilibrium fluctuations\nof the tracer's position, when the density is uniform, are obtained as an\nimportant special case.\n", "  We use state-of-the-art, three-dimensional non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (non-LTE) radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the quiet\nsolar atmosphere to carry out detailed tests of chromospheric magnetic field\ndiagnostics from free-free radiation at millimeter and submillimeter\nwavelengths (mm/submm). The vertical component of the magnetic field was\ndeduced from the mm/submm brightness spectra and the degree of circular\npolarization synthesized at millimeter frequencies. We used the frequency bands\nobserved by the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) as a\nconvenient reference. The magnetic field maps obtained describe the\nlongitudinal magnetic field at the effective formation heights of the relevant\nwavelengths in the solar chromosphere. The comparison of the deduced and model\nchromospheric magnetic fields at the spatial resolution of both the model and\ncurrent observations demonstrates a good correlation, but has a tendency to\nunderestimate the model field. The systematic discrepancy of about 10 percent\nis probably due to averaging of the restored field over the heights\ncontributing to the radiation, weighted by the strength of the contribution. On\nthe whole, the method of probing the longitudinal component of the magnetic\nfield with free-free emission at mm/submm wavelengths is found to be applicable\nto measurements of the weak quiet-Sun magnetic fields. However, successful\nexploitation of this technique requires very accurate measurements of the\npolarization properties (primary beam and receiver polarization response) of\nthe antennas, which will be the principal factor that determines the level to\nwhich chromospheric magnetic fields can be measured. Consequently,\nhigh-resolution and high-precision observations of circularly polarized\nradiation at millimeter wavelengths can be a powerful tool for producing\nchromospheric longitudinal magnetograms.\n", "  We propose a novel explanation for the Hercules stream consistent with recent\nmeasurements of the extent and pattern speed of the Galactic bar. We have\nadapted a made-to-measure dynamical model tailored for the Milky Way to\ninvestigate the kinematics of the solar neighborhood (SNd). The model matches\nthe 3D density of the red clump giant stars (RCGs) in the bulge and bar as well\nas stellar kinematics in the inner Galaxy, with a pattern speed of 39 km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Cross-matching this model with the $Gaia$ DR1 TGAS data\ncombined with RAVE and LAMOST radial velocities, we find that the model\nnaturally predicts a bimodality in the $U\\!-\\!V$-velocity distribution for\nnearby stars which is in good agreement with the Hercules stream. In the model,\nthe Hercules stream is made of stars orbiting the Lagrange points of the bar\nwhich move outward from the bar's corotation radius to visit the SNd. While the\nmodel is not yet a quantitative fit of the velocity distribution, the new\npicture naturally predicts that the Hercules stream is more prominent inward\nfrom the Sun and nearly absent only a few $100$ pc outward of the Sun, and\nplausibly explains that Hercules is prominent in old and metal-rich stars.\n", "  The phenomenon of sediment pattern formation in a channel flow is numerically\ninvestigated by performing simulations which resolve all the relevant scales of\nthe problem. The numerical approach employed and the flow configuration\nconsidered is identical to our previous study (Kidanemariam and Uhlmann J.\nFluid Mech., vol. 750, 2014, R2), the only difference being the length of the\ncomputational domain. By successively reducing the streamwise length, the\nminimum box dimension which accommodates an unstable sediment bed is revealed,\nthus determining the lower threshold of the unstable modes. For the considered\nparameter point, the cutoff length for pattern formation lies in the range\n75-100 particle diameters (3-4 times the clear fluid height). We also simulate\nthe flow in a very long streamwise box with a size of 48 times the clear fluid\nheight (featuring over one million particles), accommodating approximately 11\ninitial ripple units with a wavelength of 100-110 particle diameters. The\namplitude of the patterns exhibits two regimes of growth: an initial\nexponential regime, with a growth rate independent of the chosen domain size,\nand a subsequent non-linear regime which is strongly constrained by the domain\nlength. In the small domain cases, after the initial exponential regime, the\nripples evolve steadily maintaining their shape and migration velocity, at a\nmean wavelength equal to the length of the domain. The asymmetric ripple shape\nis characterized by a spectrum which exhibits a power-law decay over the first\nfew dominant non-dispersive modes propagating at the mean dune migration\nvelocity. The particle flowrate and the mean interface shear stress exhibited\nan increase with increasing ripple dimensions. Nevertheless, the relationship\nbetween the two was observed to be approximately described by the empirical\npower law formula for sediment transport by Wong & Parker (2006).\n", "  Bulk sensitive hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data of the Ce 3$p$ core\nlevel of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ are presented. Using a combination of full multiplet\nand configuration iteration model we were able to obtain an accurate lineshape\nanalysis of the data, thereby taking into account correlations for the strong\nplasmon intensities. We conclude that CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ is a moderately mixed\nvalence compound with a weight of 8% for the Ce $f^0$ configuration in the\nground state.\n", "  Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) has been shown to provide remarkable contrast\nfor imaging applications such as angiography, stem cell tracking, and cancer\nimaging. Recently, there is growing interest in the functional imaging\ncapabilities of MPI, where color MPI techniques have explored separating\ndifferent nanoparticles, which could potentially be used to distinguish\nnanoparticles in different states or environments. Viscosity mapping is a\npromising functional imaging application for MPI, as increased viscosity levels\nin vivo have been associated with numerous diseases such as hypertension,\natherosclerosis, and cancer. In this work, we propose a viscosity mapping\ntechnique for MPI through the estimation of the relaxation time constant of the\nnanoparticles. Importantly, the proposed time constant estimation scheme does\nnot require any prior information regarding the nanoparticles. We validate this\nmethod with extensive experiments in an in-house magnetic particle spectroscopy\n(MPS) setup at four different frequencies (between 250 Hz and 10.8 kHz) and at\nthree different field strengths (between 5 mT and 15 mT) for viscosities\nranging between 0.89 mPa.s to 15.33 mPa.s. Our results demonstrate the\nviscosity mapping ability of MPI in the biologically relevant viscosity range.\n", "  We compute the two-loop master integrals required for the leading QCD\ncorrections to the interaction vertex of a massive neutral boson $X^0$, e.g.\n$H,Z$ or $\\gamma^{*}$, with a pair of $W$ bosons, mediated by a $SU(2)_L$ quark\ndoublet composed of one massive and one massless flavor. All the external legs\nare allowed to have arbitrary invariant masses. The Magnus exponential is\nemployed to identify a set of master integrals that, around $d=4$ space-time\ndimensions, obey a canonical system of differential equations. The canonical\nmaster integrals are given as a Taylor series in $\\epsilon = (4-d)/2$, up to\norder four, with coefficients written as combination of Goncharov\npolylogarithms, respectively up to weight four. In the context of the Standard\nModel, our results are relevant for the mixed EW-QCD corrections to the Higgs\ndecay to a $W$ pair, as well as to the production channels obtained by\ncrossing, and to the triple gauge boson vertices $ZWW$ and $\\gamma^*WW$.\n", "  The solar active region photospheric magnetic field evolves rapidly during\nmajor eruptive events, suggesting appreciable feedback from the corona.\nPrevious studies of these \"magnetic imprints\" are mostly based on line-of-sight\nonly or lower-cadence vector observations; a temporally resolved depiction of\nthe vector field evolution is hitherto lacking. Here, we introduce the\nhigh-cadence (90~s or 135~s) vector magnetogram dataset from the Helioseismic\nand Magnetic Imager (HMI) that is well suited for investigating the phenomenon.\nThese observations allow quantitative characterization of the permanent,\nstep-like changes that are most pronounced in the horizontal field component\n($B_h$). A highly structured pattern emerges from analysis of an archetypical\nevent, \\texttt{SOL2011-02-15T01:56}, where $B_h$ near the main polarity\ninversion line increases significantly during the earlier phase of the\nassociated flare with a time scale of several minutes, while $B_h$ in the\nperiphery decreases at later times with smaller magnitudes and a slightly\nlonger time scale. The dataset also allows effective identification of the\n\"magnetic transient\" artifact, where enhanced flare emission alters the Stokes\nprofiles and the inferred magnetic field becomes unreliable. Our results\nprovide insights on the momentum processes in solar eruptions. The dataset may\nalso be useful to the study of sunquakes and data-driven modeling of the\ncorona.\n", "  We revisit the Glauber model to study the heavy ion reaction cross sections\nand elastic scattering angular distributions at low and intermediate energies.\nThe Glauber model takes nucleon-nucleon cross sections and nuclear densities as\ninputs and has no free parameter and thus can predict the cross sections for\nunknown systems. The Glauber model works at low energies down to Coulomb\nbarrier with very simple modifications. We present new parametrization of\nmeasured total cross sections as well as ratio of real to imaginary parts of\nthe scattering amplitudes for pp and np collisions as a function of nucleon\nkinetic energy. The nuclear (charge) densities obtained by electron scattering\nform factors measured in large momentum transfer range are used in the\ncalculations. The heavy ion reaction cross sections are calculated for light\nand heavy systems and are compared with available data measured over large\nenergy range. The model gives excellent description of the data. The elastic\nscattering angular distributions are calculated for various systems at\ndifferent energies. The model gives good description of the data at small\nmomentum transfer but the calculations deviate from the data at large momentum\ntransfer.\n", "  In recent years the scintillation mechanism of inorganic crystals has been\nextensively investigated in different studies. The main issues are the\nnon-proportionality mechanism of the light response versus energy and its\nconnection with the shaping time used for the scintillation signals. In this\nstudy the Compton coincidence technique has been used to measure the relative\nnon-proportionality of three crystals: CdWO$_{4}$, BGO, and NaI(Tl). To test\nthe non-proportionality dependence on shaping time, the preamplified\nscintillator pulses have been digitized and shaped with a digital trapezoidal\nfilter. Since no analogic shaping occurs the majority of the scintillation\ncomponents are digitized, thus avoiding major information losses. The obtained\nresults suggest the existence of a correlation between the time constant of the\nscintillation emission and light yield.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBHs) that form in the early Universe in the modified\nAffleck-Dine (AD) mechanism of baryogenesis should have intrinsic log-normal\nmass distribution of PBHs. We show that the parameters of this distribution\nadjusted to provide the required spatial density of massive seeds ($\\ge 10^4\nM_\\odot$) for early galaxy formation and not violating the dark matter density\nconstraints, predict the existence of the population of intermediate-mass PBHs\nwith a number density of $\\sim 1000$~Mpc$^{-3}$. We argue that the population\nof intermediate-mass AD PBHs can also seed the formation of globular clusters\nin galaxies. In this scenario, each globular cluster should host an\nintermediate-mass black hole with a mass of a few thousand solar masses, and\nshould not obligatorily be immersed in a massive dark matter halo.\n", "  We have investigated the low temperature quadrupolar phenomena of the\nnon-Kramers system PrRh2Zn20 under magnetic fields in the [100] and [110]\ndirections. Our experiments reveal the B-T phase diagram of PrRh2Zn20 involving\nfour electronic states regardless of the field direction, namely, a non-Fermi\nliquid (NFL) state, an antiferro-quadrupolar (AFQ) ordered state, a novel\nheavy-fermion (HF) state, and a field-induced singlet (FIS) state. In the wide\nrange of the NFL state, the resistivity can be well scaled by a characteristic\ntemperature, suggesting the realization of the quadrupole Kondo effect. The HF\nstate exhibits a Fermi liquid behavior with a large A coefficient of the T^2\nterm in the resistivity, suggesting the formation of nontrivial heavy\nquasi-particles. The FIS state results from the considerable splitting of a\nnon-Kramers doublet by a magnetic field. The phase diagram shows a large\nanisotropy with respect to the field direction. It is found that the anisotropy\nof the phase diagram can be explained in terms of that of the energy splitting\nof the non-Kramers doublet by a magnetic field. This indicates that the low\ntemperature properties of PrRh2Zn20 are governed by the non-Kramers doublet,\nnamely, quadrupole degrees of freedom. Since a similar phase diagram has been\nobtained for the related compound PrIr2Zn20, it is expected that the B-T phase\ndiagram constructed in this work is universal throughout non-Kramers systems.\n", "  We have studied the peculiarities of selective reflection from Rb vapor cell\nwith thickness $L <$ 70 nm, which is over an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe resonant wavelength for Rb atomic D$_1$ line $\\lambda$ = 795 nm. A huge\n($\\approx$ 240 MHz) red shift and spectral broadening of reflection signal is\nrecorded for $L =$ 40 nm caused by the atom-surface interaction. Also\ncompletely frequency resolved hyperfine Paschen-Back splitting of atomic\ntransitions to four components for $^{87}$Rb and six components for $^{85}$Rb\nis recorded in strong magnetic field ($B >$ 2 kG).\n", "  A split feasibility formulation for the inverse problem of\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning with\ndose-volume constraints (DVCs) included in the planning algorithm is presented.\nIt involves a new type of sparsity constraint that enables the inclusion of a\npercentage-violation constraint in the model problem and its handling by\ncontinuous (as opposed to integer) methods. We propose an iterative algorithmic\nframework for solving such a problem by applying the feasibility-seeking\nCQ-algorithm of Byrne combined with the automatic relaxation method (ARM) that\nuses cyclic projections. Detailed implementation instructions are furnished.\nFunctionality of the algorithm was demonstrated through the creation of an\nintensity-modulated proton therapy plan for a simple 2D C-shaped geometry and\nalso for a realistic base-of-skull chordoma treatment site. Monte Carlo\nsimulations of proton pencil beams of varying energy were conducted to obtain\ndose distributions for the 2D test case. A research release of the Pinnacle3\nproton treatment planning system was used to extract pencil beam doses for a\nclinical base-of-skull chordoma case. In both cases the beamlet doses were\ncalculated to satisfy dose-volume constraints according to our new algorithm.\nExamination of the dose-volume histograms following inverse planning with our\nalgorithm demonstrated that it performed as intended. The application of our\nproposed algorithm to dose-volume constraint inverse planning was successfully\ndemonstrated. Comparison with optimized dose distributions from the research\nrelease of the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system showed the algorithm could\nachieve equivalent or superior results.\n", "  We report the enhancement of spin-orbit torques in MnAl/Ta films with\nimproving chemical ordering through annealing. The switching current density is\nincreased due to enhanced saturation magnetization MS and effective anisotropy\nfield HK after annealing. Both damplinglike effective field HD and fieldlike\neffective field HF have been increased in the temperature range of 50 to 300 K.\nHD varies inversely with MS in both of the films, while the HF becomes liner\ndependent on 1/MS in the annealed film. We infer that the improved chemical\nordering has enhanced the interfacial spin transparency and the transmitting of\nthe spin current in MnAl layer.\n", "  We investigate deformations of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold singularities on the\ntoroidal orbifold $T^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_6)$ with discrete torsion\nin the framework of Type IIA orientifold model building with intersecting\nD6-branes wrapping special Lagrangian cycles. To this aim, we employ the\nhypersurface formalism developed previously for the orbifold\n$T^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ with discrete torsion and adapt it to\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_6\\times\\Omega\\mathcal{R}$ point group by\nmodding out the remaining $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ subsymmetry and the orientifold\nprojection $\\Omega\\mathcal{R}$. We first study the local behaviour of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3\\times\\Omega\\mathcal{R}$ invariant deformation orbits under\nnon-zero deformation and then develop methods to assess the deformation effects\non the fractional three-cycle volumes globally. We confirm that D6-branes\nsupporting USp(2N) or SO(2N) gauge groups do not constrain any deformation,\nwhile deformation parameters associated to cycles wrapped by D6-branes with\nU(N) gauge groups are constrained by D-term supersymmetry breaking. These\nfeatures are exposed in global prototype MSSM, Left-Right symmetric and\nPati-Salam models first constructed in arXiv:1509.00048 and arXiv:1409.1236,\nfor which we here count the number of stabilised moduli and study flat\ndirections changing the values of some gauge couplings. Finally, we confront\nthe behaviour of tree-level gauge couplings under non-vanishing deformations\nalong flat directions with the one-loop gauge threshold corrections at the\norbifold point and discuss phenomenological implications, in particular on\npossible LARGE volume scenarios and the corresponding value of the string scale\n$M_{\\text{string}}$, for the same global D6-brane models.\n", "  We report a new apparatus for the study of two-species quantum degenerate\nmixture of $^{41}$K and $^6$Li atoms. We develop and combine several advanced\ncooling techniques to achieve both large atom number and high phase space\ndensity of the two-species atom clouds. Furthermore, we build a high-efficiency\ntwo-species magnetic transport system to transfer atom clouds from the 3D\nmagneto-optical-trap chamber to a full glass science chamber of extreme high\nvacuum environment and good optical access. We perform a forced radio-frequency\nevaporative cooling for $^{41}$K atoms while the $^6$Li atoms are\nsympathetically cooled in an optically-plugged magnetic trap. Finally, we\nachieve the simultaneous quantum degeneracy for the $^{41}$K and $^6$Li atoms.\nThe Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{41}$K has 1.4$\\times$10$^5$ atoms with a\ncondensate fraction of about 62%, while the degenerate Fermi gas of $^6$Li has\na total atom number of 5.4$\\times$10$^5$ at 0.25 Fermi temperature.\n", "  Spin and charge fluctuations at vicinity of metal-to-Mott insulator\ntransitions are studied in an organic solid with molecular dimers. The extended\nHubbard model taking account of the internal electronic degree of freedom in a\nmolecular dimer is analyzed using the variational Monte Carlo method. Three\nkinds of the electronic phases, i.e. a metallic phase, an antiferromagnetic\ninsulating phase and a polar charge ordered phase, compete with each other in\nthe ground state. It is found that the polar-charge fluctuation is dominant in\na wide range of the molecular dimerization and Coulomb interaction amplitudes,\nand is enhanced remarkably near the metal-insulator phase boundary, in which\nthe spin fluctuation is almost unchanged. Implication for the $\\kappa$-type\nBEDT-TTF salts is discussed.\n", "  We construct a double-well potential for which the Schr\\\"odinger equation can\nbe exactly solved via reducing to the confluent Heun's one. Thus the wave\nfunction is expressed via the confluent Heun's function. The latter is\ntabulated in {\\sl {Maple}} so that the obtained solution is easily treated. The\npotential is infinite at the boundaries of the final interval that makes it to\nbe highly suitable for modeling hydrogen bonds (both ordinary and low-barrier\nones). We exemplify theoretical results by detailed treating the hydrogen bond\nin $KHCO_3$ and show their good agreement with literature experimental data.\n", "  The use of opto-thermal molecular energy storage at the nanoscale creates new\nopportunities for powering future microdevices with flexible synthetic\ntailorability. Practical application of these molecular materials, however,\nrequires a deeper microscopic understanding of how their behavior is altered by\nthe presence of different types of substrates. Here we present single-molecule\nresolved scanning tunneling microscopy imaging of thermally- and\noptically-induced structural transitions in (fulvalene)tetracarbonyldiruthenium\nmolecules adsorbed onto a Ag(100) surface as a prototype system. Both the\nparent complex and the photoisomer display distinct thermally-driven phase\ntransformations when they are in contact with a Ag(100) surface. This behavior\nis consistent with the loss of carbonyl ligands due to strong molecule-surface\ncoupling. Ultraviolet radiation induces marked structural changes only in the\nintact parent complex, thus indicating a photoisomerization reaction. These\nresults demonstrate how stimuli-induced structural transitions in this class of\nmolecule depend on the nature of the underlying substrate.\n", "  We study the origin of layer dependence in band structures of two-dimensional\nmaterials. We find that the layer dependence, at the density functional theory\n(DFT) level, is a result of quantum confinement and the non-linearity of the\nexchange-correlation functional. We use this to develop an efficient scheme for\nperforming DFT and GW calculations of multilayer systems. We show that the DFT\nand quasiparticle band structures of a multilayer system can be derived from a\nsingle calculation on a monolayer of the material. We test this scheme on\nmultilayers of MoS$_2$, graphene and phosphorene. This new scheme yields\nresults in excellent agreement with the standard methods at a fraction of the\ncomputation cost. This helps overcome the challenge of performing fully\nconverged GW calculations on multilayers of 2D materials, particularly in the\ncase of transition metal dichalcogenides which involve very stringent\nconvergence parameters.\n", "  We measure momentum-resolved Raman spectra of a spin-polarized degenerate\nFermi gas of $^{173}$Yb atoms for a wide range of magnetic fields, where the\natoms are irradiated by a pair of counterpropagating Raman laser beams as in\nthe conventional spin-orbit coupling scheme. Double resonance of first- and\nsecond-order Raman transitions occurs at a certain magnetic field and the\nspectrum exhibits a doublet splitting for high laser intensities. The measured\nspectral splitting is quantitatively accounted for by the Autler-Townes effect.\nWe show that our measurement results are consistent with the spinful band\nstructure of a Fermi gas in the spatially oscillating effective magnetic field\ngenerated by the Raman laser fields.\n", "  Astronomy has a rich tradition of using color photography and imaging, for\nvisualization in research as well as for sharing scientific discoveries in\nformal and informal education settings (i.e., for \"public outreach.\") In the\nmodern era, astronomical research has benefitted tremendously from electronic\ncameras that allow data and images to be generated and analyzed in a purely\ndigital form with a level of precision not previously possible. Advances in\nimage-processing software have also enabled color-composite images to be made\nin ways much more complex than with darkroom techniques, not only at optical\nwavelengths but across the electromagnetic spectrum. And the internet has made\nit possible to rapidly disseminate these images to eager audiences.\n  Alongside these technological advances, there have been gains in\nunderstanding how to make images that are scientifically illustrative as well\nas aesthetically pleasing. Studies have also given insights on how the public\ninterprets astronomical images, and how that can be different than professional\nastronomers. An understanding of these differences will help in the creation of\nimages that are meaningful to both groups.\n  In this invited review we discuss the techniques behind making\ncolor-composite images as well as examine the factors one should consider when\ndoing so, whether for data visualization or public consumption. We also provide\na brief history of astronomical imaging with a focus on the origins of the\n\"modern era\" during which distribution of high-quality astronomical images to\nthe public is a part of nearly every professional observatory's public\noutreach. We review relevant research into the expectations and misconceptions\nthat often affect the public's interpretation of these images.\n", "  The no-pumping theorem refers to a Markov system that holds the detailed\nbalance, but is subject to a time-periodic external field. It states that the\ntime-averaged probability currents nullify in the steady periodic (Floquet)\nstate, provided that the Markov system holds the Arrhenius transition rates.\nThis makes an analogy between features of steady periodic and equilibrium\nstates, because in the latter situation all probability currents vanish\nexplicitly. However, the assumption on the Arrhenius rates is fairly specific,\nand it need not be met in applications. Here a new mechanism is identified for\nthe no-pumping theorem, which holds for symmetric time-periodic external fields\nand the so called destination rates. These rates are the ones that lead to the\nlocally equilibrium form of the master equation, where dissipative effects are\nproportional to the difference between the actual probability and the\nequilibrium (Gibbsian) one. The mechanism also leads to an approximate\nno-pumping theorem for the Fokker-Planck rates that relate to the\ndiscrete-space Fokker-Planck equation.\n", "  Analysis of solar magnetic fields using observations as well as theoretical\ninterpretations of the scattering polarization is commonly designated as a high\npriority area of the solar research. The interpretation of the observed\npolarization raises a serious theoretical challenge to the researchers involved\nin this field. In fact, realistic interpretations need detailed investigations\nof the depolarizing role of isotropic collisions with neutral hydrogen. The\ngoal of this paper is to determine new relationships which allow the\ncalculation of any collisional rates of the d-levels of ions by simply\ndetermining the value of n^* and $E_p$ without the need of determining the\ninteraction potentials and treating the dynamics of collisions. The\ndetermination of n^* and E_p is easy and based on atomic data usually available\nonline. Accurate collisional rates allow a reliable diagnostics of solar\nmagnetic fields. In this work we applied our collisional FORTRAN code to a\nlarge number of cases involving complex and simple ions. After that, the\nresults are utilized and injected in a genetic programming code developed with\nC-langugae in order to infer original relationships which will be of great help\nto solar applications. We discussed the accurarcy of our collisional rates in\nthe cases of polarized complex atoms and atoms with hyperfine structure. The\nrelationships are expressed on the tensorial basis and we explain how to\ninclude their contributions in the master equation giving the variation of the\ndensity matrix elements. As a test, we compared the results obtained through\nthe general relationships provided in this work with the results obtained\ndirectly by running our code of collisions. These comparisons show a percentage\nof error of about 10% in the average value.\n", "  Experimental and theoretical results are reported for single-photon single\nionization of the tungsten ion W$^{4+}$. Absolute cross sections have been\nmeasured employing the photon-ion merged-beams setup at the Advanced Light\nSource in Berkeley. Detailed photon-energy scans were performed at 200~meV\nbandwidth in the 40 -- 105~eV range. Theoretical results have been obtained\nfrom a Dirac-Coulomb R-matrix approach employing basis sets of 730 levels for\nthe photoionization of W$^{4+}$. Calculations were carried out for the\n$4f^{14}5s^2 5p^6 5d^2 \\; {^3}{\\rm F}_{J}$, $J$=2, ground level and the\nassociated fine-structure levels with $J$=3 and 4 for the W$^{4+}$ ions. In\naddition, cross sections have been calculated for the metastable levels\n$4f^{14}5s^2 5p^6 5d^2 \\; {^3}{\\rm P}_{0,1,2},{^1}{\\rm D}_{2},{^1}{\\rm\nG}_{4},{^1}{\\rm S}_{0}$. Very satisfying agreement of theory and experiment is\nfound for the photoionization cross section of W$^{4+}$ which is remarkable\ngiven the complexity of the electronic structure of tungsten ions in low charge\nstates.\n", "  We used volume-of-fluid (VOF) method to perform three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations of droplet formation of Newtonian fluids in microfluidic T-junction\ndevices. To evaluate the performance of the VOF method we examined the regimes\nof drop formation and determined droplet size as a function of system\nparameters. Comparison of the simulation results with four sets of experimental\ndata from the literature showed good agreement, validating the VOF method.\nMotivated by the lack of adequate studies investigating the influence of\nviscosity ratio ({\\lambda}) on the generated droplet size, we mapped the\ndependence of drop volume on capillary number (0.001 < Ca < 0.5) and viscosity\nratio (0.01 < {\\lambda} < 15). We find that for all viscosity ratios\ninvestigated, droplet size decreases with increase in capillary number.\nHowever, the reduction in droplet size with capillary number is stronger for\n{\\lambda} < 1 than for {\\lambda} > 1. In addition, we find that at a given\ncapillary number, the size of droplets does not vary appreciably when {\\lambda}\n< 1, while it increases when {\\lambda} > 1. We develop an analytical model for\npredicting droplet size that includes a viscosity-dependent breakup time for\nthe dispersed phase. This improved model successfully predicts the effects of\nviscosity ratio observed in simulations. Results from this study are useful for\nthe design of lab-on-chip technologies and manufacture of microfluidic\nemulsions, where there is a need to know how system parameters influence\ndroplet size.\n", "  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is the first dense redshift survey\nencompassing a volume large enough to find the best analytic probability\ndensity function that fits the galaxy Counts-in-Cells distribution $f_V(N)$,\nthe frequency distribution of galaxy counts in a volume $V$. Different analytic\nfunctions have been previously proposed that can account for some of the\nobserved features of the observed frequency counts, but fail to provide an\noverall good fit to this important statistical descriptor of the galaxy\nlarge-scale distribution. Our goal is to find the probability density function\nthat better fits the observed Counts-in-Cells distribution $f_V(N)$. We have\nmade a systematic study of this function applied to several samples drawn from\nthe SDSS. We show the effective ways to deal with incompleteness of the sample\n(masked data) in the calculation of $f_V(N)$. We use LasDamas simulations to\nestimate the errors in the calculation. We test four different distribution\nfunctions to find the best fit: the Gravitational Quasi-Equilibrium\ndistribution, the Negative Binomial Distribution, the Log Normal distribution\nand the Log Normal Distribution including a bias parameter. In the two latter\ncases, we apply a shot-noise correction to the distributions assuming the local\nPoisson model. We show that the best fit for the Counts-in-Cells distribution\nfunction is provided by the Negative Binomial distribution. In addition, at\nlarge scales the Log Normal distribution modified with the inclusion of the\nbias term also performs a satisfactory fit of the empirical values of $f_V(N)$.\nOur results demonstrate that the inclusion of a bias term in the Log Normal\ndistribution is necessary to fit the observed galaxy Count-in-Cells\ndistribution function.\n", "  Context. The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric\nSolution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides\nthe position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated\nusing Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims. We\ninvestigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by\nmeans of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods. Mean cluster parallax\nand proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations\nwithin the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the\ninternal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects\nof the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of\nthe TGAS data is assessed. Results. Values given for standard uncertainties are\nstill inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of\nleast squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster\nparallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with\nearlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the\nPleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that\ndiscrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the\ncluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether\nthose potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the\nclusters. Conclusions. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters\nfar beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership\nassessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows\nthe same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly\nincreased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs.\n", "  Charge exchange emission is known to provide a key diagnostic to the\ninterface between hot and cold matter in many astrophysical environments. Most\nof the recent charge exchange studies focus on its emission in the X-ray band,\nbut few on the UV part, although the latter can also provide a powerful probe\nof the charge exchange process. An atomic calculation, as well as an\napplication to observed data, are presented to explore and describe the\npotential use of the UV data for the study of cosmic charge exchange. Using the\nnewest charge exchange model in the SPEX code v3.03, we re-analyze an archival\nHubble STIS data of the central region of NGC 1275. The NGC 1275 spectrum shows\nhints for three possible weak lines at about 1223.6~{\\AA}, 1242.4~{\\AA}, and\n1244.0~{\\AA}, each with a significance of about $2-3\\sigma$. The putative\nfeatures are best explained by charge exchange between highly ionized hydrogen,\nneon, and sulfur with neutral matter. The wavelengths of the charge exchange\nlines are found robustly with uncertainties $\\leq 0.3$~{\\AA}. The possible\ncharge exchange emission shows a line-of-sight velocity offset of about $-3400$\nkm s$^{-1}$ with respect to the NGC 1275 nucleus, which resembles one of the\nLy$\\alpha$ absorbers reported in Baum et al. (2005). This indicates that the\ncharge exchange lines might be emitted as the same position of the absorber,\nwhich could be ascribed to outflowing gas from the nucleus.\n", "  We perform the complete symmetry classification of the Klein-Gordon equation\nin maximal symmetric spacetimes. The central idea is to find all possible\npotential functions $V(t,x,y)$ that admit Lie and Noether symmetries. This is\ndone by using the relation between the symmetry vectors of the differential\nequations and the elements of the conformal algebra of the underlying geometry.\nFor some of the potentials, we use the admitted Lie algebras to determine\ncorresponding invariant solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation. An integral\npart of this analysis is the problem of the classification of Lie and Noether\npoint symmetries of the wave equation.\n", "  The surprising thinness of the solar tachocline is still not understood with\ncertainty today. Among the numerous possible scenarios suggested to explain its\nradial confinement, one hypothesis is based on Maxwell stresses that are\nexerted by the cyclic dynamo magnetic field of the Sun penetrating over a skin\ndepth below the turbulent convection zone. Our goal is to assess under which\nconditions (turbulence level in the tachocline, strength of the\ndynamo-generated field, spreading mechanism) this scenario can be realized in\nthe solar tachocline. We develop a simplified 1D model of the upper tachocline\nunder the influence of an oscillating magnetic field imposed from above. The\nturbulent transport is parametrized with enhanced turbulent diffusion (or\nanti-diffusion) coefficients. Two main processes that thicken the tachocline\nare considered; either turbulent viscous spreading or radiative spreading. An\nextensive parameter study is carried out to establish the physical parameter\nregimes under which magnetic confinement of the tachocline that is due to a\nsurface dynamo field can be realized. We have explored a large range of\nmagnetic field amplitudes, viscosities, ohmic diffusivities and thermal\ndiffusivities. We find that, for large but still realistic magnetic field\nstrengths, the differential rotation can be suppressed in the upper radiative\nzone (and hence the tachocline confined) if weak turbulence is present (with an\nenhanced ohmic diffusivity of $\\eta > 10^{7-8} \\, cm^2/s$), even in the\npresence of radiative spreading. Our results show that a dynamo magnetic field\ncan, in the presence of weak turbulence, prevent the inward burrowing of a\ntachocline subject to viscous diffusion or radiative spreading.\n", "  We compute time-ordered 2- and 3-pt correlation functions of CFT scalar\noperators between generic in/out states. The calculation is holographically\ncarried out by considering a non backreacting AdS scalar field with a $\\lambda\n\\phi^3$ self-interaction term on a combination of Euclidean and Lorentzian AdS\nsections following the Skenderis-van Rees prescription. We show that, although\nworking in an essentially different set up, the final result for the 3-pt\ncorrelators agree with those of Rastelli et al. for Euclidean AdS. By analyzing\nthe inner product between the in/out excited states in the large $N$\napproximation, we argue that a cubic bulk interaction deforms the excited\nstates from coherent into \\emph{squeezed}. Finally, a diagrammatic\ninterpretation of the results suggests some general properties for the\n$n$-point correlation functions between excited states.\n", "  Microresonator-based optical frequency combs, or \"microcombs\", have attracted\nlots of attention in the last few years thanks to their promising applications\nin telecommunications, spectroscopy and optical clocks. The process of comb\ngeneration in microresonators can be modelled in the frequency domain using\ncoupled mode equations, and has also recently been successfully described in\nthe time domain using a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation known as the\nLugiato-Lefever equation. Though time-domain approaches have brought many\ninteresting insights for the understanding of microcombs, an intuitive\nfrequency-domain model has not yet been established. In this work we present a\nfrequency-domain model of microcombs that describes the overall structure of\nthe spectra in terms of a few collective excitations of groups of neighboring\ncomb lines, which we term \"superoscillators\". This approach ties in nicely with\nthe recently-developed time-domain model based on soliton crystals, and links\nthe microcomb generation process with frequency response theory.\n", "  We report the results from a spectrophotometric study sampling the roughly\n300 candidate supernova remnants (SNRs) in M83 identified through optical\nimaging with Magellan/IMACS and HST/WFC3. Of the 118 candidates identified\nbased on a high [S II] $\\lambda\\lambda$ 6716,6731 to H$\\alpha$ emission ratio,\n117 show spectroscopic signatures of shock-heated gas, confirming them as\nSNRs---the largest uniform set of SNR spectra for any galaxy. Spectra of 22\nobjects with a high [O III] 5007 $\\lambda$ to H$\\alpha$ emission ratio,\nselected in an attempt to identify young ejecta-dominated SNRs like Cas A,\nreveal only one (previously reported) object with the broad (over 1000 km/s)\nemission lines characteristic of ejecta-dominated SNRs, beyond the known\nSN1957D remnant. The other 20 [O III]-selected candidates include planetary\nnebulae, compact H II regions, and one background QSO. Although our\nspectroscopic sample includes 22 SNRs smaller than 11 pc, none of the other\nobjects shows broad emission lines; instead their spectra stem from relatively\nslow (< 200 km/s) radiative shocks propagating into the metal-rich interstellar\nmedium of M83. With six SNe in the past century, one might expect more of M83's\nsmall-diameter SNRs to show evidence of ejecta; this appears not to be the\ncase. We attribute their absence to several factors, including that SNRs\nexpanding into a dense medium evolve quickly to the ISM-dominated phase, and\nthat SNRs expanding into regions already evacuated by earlier SNe are probably\nvery faint.\n", "  Continuous microseismic monitoring of hydraulic fracturing is commonly used\nin many engineering, environmental, mining, and petroleum applications.\nMicroseismic signals recorded at the surface, suffer from excessive noise that\ncomplicates first-break picking and subsequent data processing and analysis.\nThis study presents a new first-break picking algorithm that employs concepts\nfrom seismic interferometry and time-frequency (TF) analysis. The algorithm\nfirst uses a TF plot to manually pick a reference first-break and then iterates\nthe steps of cross-correlation, alignment, and stacking to enhance the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the relative first breaks. The reference first-break\nis subsequently used to calculate final first breaks from the relative ones.\nTesting on synthetic and real data sets at high levels of additive noise shows\nthat the algorithm enhances the first-break picking considerably. Furthermore,\nresults show that only two iterations are needed to converge to the true first\nbreaks. Indeed, iterating more can have detrimental effects on the algorithm\ndue to increasing correlation of random noise.\n", "  We demonstrate that Casimir forces associated with zero-point fluctuations of\nquantum vacuum may be substantially affected by the presence of dynamical\ntopological defects. In order to illustrate this nonperturbative effect we\nstudy the Casimir interactions between dielectric wires in a compact\nformulation of Abelian gauge theory in two spatial dimensions. The model\npossesses topological defects, instanton-like monopoles, which are known to be\nresponsible for nonperturbative generation of a mass gap and for a linear\nconfinement of electrically charged probes. Despite the model has no matter\nfields, the Casimir energy depends on the value of the gauge coupling constant.\nWe show, both analytically and numerically, that in the strong coupling regime\nthe Abelian monopoles make the Casimir forces short-ranged. Simultaneously,\ntheir presence increases the interaction strength between the wires at short\ndistances for certain range of values of the gauge coupling. The wires suppress\nmonopole density in the space between them compared to the density outside the\nwires. In the weak coupling regime the monopoles become dilute and the Casimir\npotential reduces to a known theoretical result which does not depend on the\ngauge coupling.\n", "  PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, the extension of conventional quantum\nmechanics to the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian invariant under the combined parity\n(P) and time reversal (T) symmetry, has been successfully applied to a variety\nof fields such as solid state physics, mathematical physics, optics, quantum\nfield theory. Recently, the extension of PT-symmetrical theory to entangled\nquantum systems was challenged in that PT formulation within the conventional\nHilbert space violates the no-signaling principle. Here, we revisit the\nderivation of non-signaling principle in the framework of PT inner product\nprescription. Our results preserve the no-signaling principle for a two-qubit\nsystem, reaffirm the invariance of the entanglement, and reproduce the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. We conclude that PT-symmetric\nquantum mechanics satisfies the requirements for a fundamental theory and\nprovides a consistent description of quantum systems.\n", "  Light propagation in two Swiss cheese models based on anisotropic Szekeres\nstructures is studied and compared with light propagation in Swiss cheese\nmodels based on the Szekeres models' underlying LTB models. The study shows\nthat the anisotropy of the Szekeres models has only a small effect on\nquantities such as redshift-distance relations, projected shear and expansion\nrate along individual light rays. \\newline\\indent The average angular diameter\ndistance to the last scattering surface is computed for each model. Contrary to\nearlier studies, the results obtained here are (mostly) in agreement with\nperturbative results. In particular, a small negative shift, $\\delta\nD_A:=\\frac{D_A-D_{A,bg}}{D_{A,bg}}$, in the angular diameter distance is\nobtained upon line-of-sight averaging in three of the four models. The results\nare, however, not statistically significant. In the fourth model, there is a\nsmall positive shift which has an especially small statistical significance.\nThe line-of-sight averaged inverse magnification at $z = 1100$ is consistent\nwith $1$ to a high level of confidence for all models, indicating that the area\nof the surface corresponding to $z = 1100$ is close to that of the background.\n", "  We report giant resistive switching of an order of 104, long-time charge\nretention characteristics up to 104 s, non-overlapping SET and RESET voltages,\nohmic in low resistance state (LRS) and space charge limited current (SCLC)\nmechanism in high resistance state (HRS) properties in polycrystalline\nperovskite Cobalt Titanate (CoTiO3 ~ CTO) thin films. Impedance spectroscopy\nstudy was carried out for both LRS and HRS states which illustrates that only\nbulk resistance changes after resistance switching, however, there is a small\nchange (<10% which is in pF range) in the bulk capacitance value in both\nstates. These results suggest that in LRS state current filaments break the\ncapacitor in many small capacitors in a parallel configuration which in turn\nprovides the same capacitance in both states even there was 90 degree changes\nin phase-angle and an order of change in the tangent loss.\n", "  The formation of monolayer and multilayer ice with a square lattice structure\nhas recently been reported on the basis of transmission electron microscopy\nexperiments, renewing interest in confined two dimensional ice. Here we report\na systematic density functional theory study of double-layer ice in\nnano-confinement. A phase diagram as a function of confinement width and\nlateral pressure is presented. Included in the phase diagram are honeycomb\nhexagonal, square-tube, hexagonal-close-packed and buckled-rhombic structures.\nHowever, contrary to experimental observations, square structures do not\nfeature: our most stable double-layer square structure is predicted to be\nmetastable. This study provides general insight into the phase transitions of\ndouble-layer confined ice and a fresh theoretical perspective on the stability\nof square ice in graphene nanocapillary experiments.\n", "  The renormalization group functions for six dimensional scalar $\\phi^3$\ntheory with an $F_4$ symmetry are provided at four loops in the modified\nminimal subtraction (MSbar) scheme. Aside from the anomalous dimension of\n$\\phi$ and the $\\beta$-function this includes the mass operator and a\n$\\phi^2$-type operator. The anomalous dimension of the latter is computed\nexplicitly at four loops for the $\\mathbf{26}$ and $\\mathbf{324}$\nrepresentations of $F_4$. The $\\epsilon$ expansion of all the related critical\nexponents are determined to $O(\\epsilon^4)$. For instance the value for\n$\\Delta_\\phi$ agrees with recent conformal bootstrap estimates in $5$ and\n$5.95$ dimensions. The renormalization group functions are also provided at\nfour loops for the group $E_6$.\n", "  GeV-TeV gamma-rays and PeV-EeV neutrino backgrounds provide a unique window\non the nature of the ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs). We discuss the\nimplications of the recent Fermi-LAT data regarding the extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground (EGB) and related estimates of the contribution of point sources as\nwell as IceCube neutrino data on the origin of the UHECRs. We calculate the\ndiffuse flux of cosmogenic $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos produced by the UHECRs\nand derive constraints on the possible cosmological evolution of UHECR sources.\nIn particular, we show that the mixed-composition scenario considered in\n\\citet{Globus2015b}, which is in agreement with both (i) Auger measurements of\nthe energy spectrum and composition up to the highest energies and (ii) the\nankle-like feature in the light component detected by KASCADE-Grande, is\ncompatible with both the Fermi-LAT measurements and with current IceCube\nlimits. We also discuss the possibility for future experiments to detect\nassociated cosmogenic neutrinos and further constrain the UHECR models,\nincluding possible subdominant UHECR proton sources.\n", "  The deterministic equations describing the dynamics of the atmosphere (and of\nthe climate system) are known to display the property of sensitivity to initial\nconditions. In the ergodic theory of chaos this property is usually quantified\nby computing the Lyapunov exponents. In this review, these quantifiers computed\nin a hierarchy of atmospheric models (coupled or not to an ocean) are analyzed,\ntogether with their local counterparts known as the local or finite-time\nLyapunov exponents. It is shown in particular that the variability of the local\nLyapunov exponents (corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponent) decreases\nwhen the model resolution increases. The dynamics of (finite-amplitude) initial\ncondition errors in these models is also reviewed, and in general found to\ndisplay a complicated growth far from the asymptotic estimates provided by the\nLyapunov exponents. The implications of these results for operational (high\nresolution) atmospheric and climate modelling are also discussed.\n", "  We present a survey for water maser emission toward a sample of 44\nlow-luminosity young objects, comprising (proto-)brown dwarfs, first\nhydrostatic cores (FHCs), and other young stellar objects (YSOs) with\nbolometric luminosities lower than 0.4 L$_\\odot$. Water maser emission is a\ngood tracer of energetic processes, such as mass-loss and/or accretion, and is\na useful tool to study this processes with very high angular resolution. This\ntype of emission has been confirmed in objects with L$_{\\rm bol}\\ge 1$\nL$_\\odot$. Objects with lower luminosities also undergo mass-loss and\naccretion, and thus, are prospective sites of maser emission. Our sensitive\nsingle-dish observations provided a single detection when pointing toward the\nFHC L1448 IRS 2E. However, follow-up interferometric observations showed water\nmaser emission associated with the nearby YSO L1448 IRS 2 { (a Class 0\nprotostar of L$_{\\rm bol}\\simeq 3.6-5.3$ L$_\\odot$)}, and did not find any\nemission toward L1448 IRS 2E. The upper limits for water maser emission\ndetermined by our observations are one order of magnitude lower than expected\nfrom the correlation between water maser luminosities and bolometric\nluminosities found for YSOs. This suggests that this correlation does not hold\nat the lower end of the (sub)stellar mass spectrum. Possible reasons are that\nthe slope of this correlation is steeper at L$_{\\rm bol}\\le 1$ L$_\\odot$, or\nthat there is an absolute luminosity threshold below which water maser emission\ncannot be produced. Alternatively, if the correlation still stands at low\nluminosity, the detection rates of masers would be significantly lower than the\nvalues obtained in higher-luminosity Class 0 protostars.\n", "  Time-dependent analytic solutions of the Einstein-Skyrme system --gravitating\nSkyrmions--, with topological charge one are analyzed in detail. In particular,\nthe question of whether these Skyrmions reach a spherically symmetric\nconfiguration for $t\\rightarrow+\\infty$ is discussed. It is shown that there is\na static, spherically symmetric solution described by the Ermakov-Pinney\nsystem, which is fully integrable by algebraic methods. For $\\Lambda>0$ this\nspherically symmetric solution is found to be in a \"neutral equilibrium\" under\nsmall deformations, in the sense that under a small squashing it would neither\nblow up nor dissapear after a long time, but it would remain finite forever\n(plastic deformation). Thus, in a sense, the coupling with Einstein gravity\nspontaneously breaks the spherical symmetry of the solution. However, in spite\nof the lack of isotropy, for $t \\to\\infty$ (and $\\Lambda>0$) the space time is\nlocally flat and the anisotropy of the Skyrmion only reflects the squashing of\nspacetime.\n", "  After thirty years of the discovery of the fundamental plane, explanations to\nthe tilt of the fundamental plane with respect to the virial plane still suffer\nfrom the need of fine-tuning. In this paper, we try to explore the origin of\nthis tilt from the perspective of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) by\napplying the 16 Coma galaxies available in Thomas et al.[1]. Based on the mass\nmodels that can reproduce de Vaucouleurs' law closely, we find that the tilt of\nthe traditional fundamental plane is naturally explained by the simple form of\nthe MONDian interpolating function, if we assume a well motivated choice of\nanisotropic velocity distribution, and adopt the Kroupa or Salpeter stellar\nmass-to-light ratio. Our analysis does not necessarily rule out a varying\nstellar mass-to-light ratio.\n", "  The young star Elias 2-27 has recently been observed to posses a massive\ncircumstellar disc with two prominent large-scale spiral arms. In this Letter\nwe perform three-dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations,\nradiative transfer modelling, synthetic ALMA imaging and an unsharped masking\ntechnique to explore three possibilities for the origin of the observed\nstructures -- an undetected companion either internal or external to the\nspirals, and a self-gravitating disc. We find that a gravitationally unstable\ndisc and a disc with an external companion can produce morphology that is\nconsistent with the observations. In addition, for the latter, we find that the\ncompanion could be a relatively massive planetary mass companion (less than\napproximately 10 - 13 MJup) and located at large radial distances (between\napproximately 300 - 700 au). We therefore suggest that Elias 2-27 may be one of\nthe first detections of a disc undergoing gravitational instabilities, or a\ndisc that has recently undergone fragmentation to produce a massive companion.\n", "  On spacetimes that are not time orientable we construct a U(1) bundle to\nmeasure the twisting of the time axis. This single assumption, and simple\nconstruction, gives rise to Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, the\nLorentz force law and the Einstein-Maxwell equations for electromagnetism\ncoupled to General relativity. The derivations follow the Kaluza Klein theory,\nbut with the constraints required for connections on a U(1) bundle rather than\nfive spacetime dimensions. The non time orientability is seen to justify and\nconstrain Kaluza Klein theories exactly as required to unify gravitation with\nelectromagnetism. Unlike any other schemes, apparent net electric charges arise\nnaturally because the direction of the electric field reverses along a time\nreversing path. The boundary of a time reversing region can therefore have a\nnet electric flux and appear exactly as a region containing an electric charge.\nThe treatment is purely classical, but motivated by links between acausal\nstructures and quantum theory.\n", "  Suspensions of cornstarch in water exhibit strong dynamic shear-thickening.\nWe show that partly replacing water by ethanol strongly alters the suspension\nrheology. We perform steady and non-steady rheology measurements combined with\natomic force microscopy to investigate the role of fluid chemistry on the\nmacroscopic rheology of the suspensions and its link with the interactions\nbetween cornstarch grains. Upon increasing the ethanol content, the suspension\ngoes through a yield-stress fluid state and ultimately becomes a shear-thinning\nfluid. On the cornstarch grain scale, atomic force microscopy measurements\nreveal the presence of polymers on the cornstarch surface, which exhibit a\nco-solvency effect. At intermediate ethanol content, a maximum of polymer\nsolubility induces high microscopic adhesion which we relate to the macroscopic\nyield stress.\n", "  Reduction of images and science analysis from ground-based telescopes such as\nthe LSST requires detailed knowledge of the PSF of the image, which includes\ncomponents attributable to the instrument as well as components attributable to\nthe atmosphere. Because the atmospheric component is constantly changing, the\nPSF is typically extracted from each image by measuring the size and shape of\nstar images across the CCD, then building a fitting function over the focal\nplane which is used to model the PSF for analysis of extended sources such as\ngalaxies. Since the stars in each CCD field have a range of brightnesses,\naccurate knowledge of the PSF for point sources of varying brightness is\nessential. It has been found that in thick, fully-depleted CCDs, the\nelectrostatic repulsion of charge stored in the collecting wells gives rise to\na larger and slightly more elliptical PSF for brighter stars. This\n\"brighter-fatter\" effect has been reported in some detail in the literature. In\nthis work, we report direct and indirect measurements of this effect in\nprototype LSST sensors, and describe a detailed physics-based model of the\nelectrostatics and charge transport within the CCD.\n", "  Turbulent flows preferentially concentrate inertial particles depending on\ntheir stopping time or Stokes number, which can lead to significant spatial\nvariations in the particle concentration. Cascade models are one way to\ndescribe this process in statistical terms. Here, we use a direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) dataset of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence to determine\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs) for cascade multipliers, which\ndetermine the ratio by which a property is partitioned into sub-volumes as an\neddy is envisioned to decay into smaller eddies. We present a technique for\ncorrecting effects of small particle numbers in the statistics. We determine\nmultiplier PDFs for particle number, flow dissipation, and enstrophy, all of\nwhich are shown to be scale dependent. However, the particle multiplier PDFs\ncollapse when scaled with an appropriately defined local Stokes number. As\nanticipated from earlier works, dissipation and enstrophy multiplier PDFs reach\nan asymptote for sufficiently small spatial scales. From the DNS measurements,\nwe derive a cascade model that is used it to make predictions for the radial\ndistribution function (RDF) for arbitrarily high Reynolds numbers, $Re$,\nfinding good agreement with the asymptotic, infinite $Re$ inertial range theory\nof Zaichik and Alipchenkov [New Journal of Physics 11, 103018 (2009)]. We\ndiscuss implications of these results for the statistical modeling of the\nturbulent clustering process in the inertial range for high Reynolds numbers\ninaccessible to numerical simulations.\n", "  A theory of relativistic space-charge-limited current (SCLC) is formulated to\ndetermine the SCLC scaling, $J\\propto V^{\\alpha}/L^{\\beta}$, for a finite\nbandgap Dirac material of length $L$ biased under a voltage $V$. In a\none-dimensional (1D) bulk geometry, our model allows ($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) to\nvary from (2,3) for the non-relativistic model in traditional solids to (3/2,2)\nfor the ultra-relativistic model of massless Dirac fermions. For a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) thin-film geometry, we obtain $\\alpha = \\beta$ that varies\nbetween 2 and 3/2, respectively, at the non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic\nlimits. We further provide a rigorous proof based on a Green's function\napproach that for uniform SCLC model described by carrier density-dependent\nmobility, the scaling relations of the 1D bulk model can be directly mapped\ninto the case of 2D thin film for any contact geometries. Our simplified\napproach provides a convenient tool to obtain the 2D thin-film SCLC scaling\nrelations without the need of explicitly solving the complicated 2D problems.\nFinally, this work clarifies the inconsistency in using the traditional SCLC\nmodels to explain the experimental measurement of 2D Dirac semiconductor. We\nconclude that the voltage-scaling $3/2 < \\alpha < 2$ is a distinct signature of\nmassive Dirac fermions in Dirac semiconductor and is in agreement with\nexperimental SCLC measurement in MoS$_2$.\n", "  RoadMapping is a dynamical modeling machinery developed to constrain the\nMilky Way's (MW) gravitational potential by simultaneously fitting an\naxisymmetric parametrized potential and an action-based orbit distribution\nfunction (DF) to discrete 6D phase-space measurements of stars in the Galactic\ndisk. In this work we demonstrate RoadMapping's robustness in the presence of\nspiral arms by modeling data drawn from an N-body simulation snapshot of a\ndisk-dominated galaxy of MW mass with strong spiral arms (but no bar),\nexploring survey volumes with radii 500pc<=r_max<=5kpc. The potential\nconstraints are very robust, even though we use a simple action-based DF, the\nquasi-isothermal DF (qDF). The best-fit RoadMapping model always recovers the\ncorrect gravitational forces where most of the stars that entered the analysis\nare located, even for small volumes. For data from large survey volumes,\nRoadMapping finds axisymmetric models that average well over the spiral arms.\nUnsurprisingly, the models are slightly biased by the excess of stars in the\nspiral arms. Gravitational potential models derived from survey volumes with at\nleast r_max=3kpc can be reliably extrapolated to larger volumes. However, a\nlarge radial survey extent, r_max~5kpc, is needed to correctly recover the halo\nscale length. In general, the recovery and extrapolability of potentials\ninferred from data sets which were drawn from inter-arm regions appear to be\nbetter than those of data sets drawn from spiral arms. Our analysis implies\nthat building axisymmetric models for the Galaxy with upcoming Gaia data will\nlead to sensible and robust approximations of the MW's potential.\n", "  An ion in a radiofrequency ion trap interacting with a buffer gas of\nultracold neutral atoms is a driven dynamical system which has been found to\ndevelop a non-thermal energy distribution with a power law tail. The exact\nanalytical form of this distribution is unknown, but has often been represented\nempirically by q-exponential (Tsallis) functions. Based on the concepts of\nsuperstatistics, we introduce a framework for the statistical mechanics of an\nion trapped in an RF field subject to collisions with a buffer gas. We derive\nanalytic ion secular energy distributions from first principles both neglecting\nand including the effects of the thermal energy of the buffer gas. For a buffer\ngas with a finite temperature, we prove that Tsallis statistics emerges from\nthe combination of a constant heating term and multiplicative energy\nfluctuations. We show that the resulting distributions essentially depend on\nexperimentally controllable parameters paving the way for an accurate control\nof the statistical properties of ion-atom hybrid systems.\n", "  We observe a large fraction of circular polarization in radio emission from\nextensive air showers recorded during thunderstorms, much higher than in the\nemission from air showers measured during fair-weather circumstances. We show\nthat the circular polarization of the air showers measured during thunderstorms\ncan be explained by the change in the direction of the transverse current as a\nfunction of altitude induced by atmospheric electric fields. Thus by using the\nfull set of Stokes parameters for these events, we obtain a good\ncharacterization of the electric fields in thunderclouds. We also measure a\nlarge horizontal component of the electric fields in the two events that we\nhave analysed.\n", "  Genzel et al. have recently published the rotation curves of six\nhigh-redshift disc galaxies ($z\\sim 0.9-2.4$), which they find to be `baryon\ndominated' within the studies radii. While not up to the standard afforded by\ndata available for analysis in the nearby Universe, these data are valuable in\nconstraining cosmological evolution of either DM scenarios, or -- as I discuss\nhere -- $z$-dependence of MOND. Indeed, these results, if taken at face value,\nteach us useful lessons in connection with MOND. a. The dynamical accelerations\nat the half-light radii, found by Genzel et al., are rather high compared with\nthe MOND acceleration constant, as measured in the nearby Universe:\n$g(R_{1/2})= (3-11)a_0$. MOND then predicts fractions of `phantom matter' at\n$R_{1/2}$ of at most a few tens of percents, which, galaxy by galaxy, agree\nwell with what Genzel et al. find. b. The asymptotic rotational speeds\npredicted by MOND from the baryonic-mass estimates of Genzel et al. are\nsubstantially lower ($0.55-0.75$) than the maximal speeds of the RCs. MOND thus\npredicts a substantial decline of the RCs beyond the maximum. This too is in\nline with what Genzel et al. find. c. Arguably, the most important lesson is\nthat the findings of Genzel et al. cast very meaningful constraints on possible\nvariation of $a_0$ with cosmic time. For example, they all but exclude a value\nof the MOND constant of $\\sim 4a_0$ at $z\\sim 2$, excluding, e.g., $a_0\\propto\n(1+z)^{3/2}$.\n", "  We explore the connection between the operator product expansion (OPE) in the\nboundary and worldsheet conformal field theories in the context of\nAdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. Considering single trace scalar operators\nin the boundary theory and using the saddle point analysis of the worldsheet\nOPE [1], we derive an explicit relation between OPE coefficients in the\nboundary and worldsheet theories for the contribution of single trace spin\n$\\ell$ operators to the OPE. We also consider external vector operators and\nobtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace\nscalar operators in the OPE. We revisit the relationship between the bulk cubic\ncouplings in the Supergravity approximation and the OPE coefficients in the\ndual boundary theory. Our results match with the known examples from the case\nof AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. For the operators whose two and three point correlators\nenjoy a non renormalization theorem, this gives a set of three way relations\nbetween the bulk cubic couplings in supergravity and the OPE coefficients in\nthe boundary and worldsheet theories.\n", "  Interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes material from a\ncompanion - cataclysmic variables (CVs) in which the mass donor is a Roche-lobe\nfilling star on or near the main sequence, and symbiotic stars in which the\nmass donor is a late type giant - are relatively commonplace. They display a\nwide range of behaviors in the optical, X-rays, and other wavelengths, which\nstill often baffle observers and theorists alike. Here I review the existing\nbody of research on X-ray emissions from these objects for the benefits of both\nexperts and newcomers to the field. I provide introductions to the past and\ncurrent X-ray observatories, the types of known X-ray emissions from these\nobjects, and the data analysis techniques relevant to this field. I then\nsummarize of our knowledge regarding the X-ray emissions from magnetic CVs,\nnon-magnetic CVs and symbiotic stars, and novae in eruption. I also discuss\nspace density and the X-ray luminosity functions of these binaries and their\ncontribution to the integrated X-ray emission from the Galaxy. I then discuss\nopen questions and future prospects.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the ground-state properties and related quantum\nphase transitions for the two-component Bose-Einstein condensate in a\nsingle-mode optical cavity. Apart from the usual normal and superradiant phases\nmulti-stable macroscopic quantum states are realized by means of the\nspin-coherent-state variational method. We demonstrate analytically the\nstimulated radiation from collective state of atomic population inversion,\nwhich does not exist in the normal Dicke model with single-component atoms. It\nis also revealed that the stimulated radiation can be generated only from one\ncomponent of atoms and the other remains in the ordinary superradiant state.\nHowever the order of superradiant and stimulatedradiation states is\ninterchangeable between two components of atoms by tuning the relative\natom-field couplings and the frequency detuning as well.\n", "  Foams made of complex fluids such as particle suspensions have a great\npotential for the development of advanced aerated materials. In this paper we\nstudy the rheological behavior of liquid foams loaded with granular\nsuspensions. We focus on the effect of small particles, i.e. particle-to-bubble\nsize ratio smaller than 0.1, and we measure the complex modulus as a function\nof particle size and particle volume fraction. With respect to previous work,\nthe results highlight a new elastic regime characterized by unequaled modulus\nvalues as well as independence of size ratio. A careful investigation of the\nmaterial microstructure reveals that particles organize through the network\nbetween the gas bubbles and form a granular skeleton structure with tightly\npacked particles. The latter is proven to be responsible for the reported new\nelastic regime. Rheological probing performed by strain sweep reveals a\ntwo-step yielding of the material: the first one occurs at small strain and is\nclearly attributed to yielding of the granular skeleton; the second one\ncorresponds to the yielding of the bubble assembly, as observed for\nparticle-free foams. Moreover the elastic modulus measured at small strain is\nquantitatively described by models for solid foams in assuming that the\ngranular skeleton possesses a bulk elastic modulus of order 100 kPa. Additional\nrheology experiments performed on the bulk granular material indicate that this\nsurprisingly high value can be understood as soon as the magnitude of the\nconfinement pressure exerted by foam bubbles on packed grains is considered.\n", "  We demonstrate that the fluorescent emitters can increase light emission from\nthe plasmonic nanostructures in turn. With the help of atomic force microscopy,\na hybrid system consisting of a fluorescent nanodiamond and a gold nanoparticle\nwas assembled step-by-step for in situ optical measurements. We found that the\nemission from the nanoparticle increased compared with that before coupling.\nThe interaction between plasmonic nanostructures and fluorescent emitter was\nunderstood as an entity based on the concept of a quantized optical cavity by\nconsidering the nanodiamond and the nanoparticle as a two-level energy system\nand a nanoresonator, respectively. The theoretical calculations reveal that\nboth the plasmonic coupling effect and the dielectric nanoantenna effect\ncontribute to the enhancement of light emission from the gold nanoparticles.\n", "  We investigate possible signatures of halo assembly bias for\nspectroscopically selected galaxy groups from the GAMA survey using weak\nlensing measurements from the spatially overlapping regions of the deeper,\nhigh-imaging-quality photometric KiDS survey. We use GAMA groups with an\napparent richness larger than 4 to identify samples with comparable mean host\nhalo masses but with a different radial distribution of satellite galaxies,\nwhich is a proxy for the formation time of the haloes. We measure the weak\nlensing signal for groups with a steeper than average and with a shallower than\naverage satellite distribution and find no sign of halo assembly bias, with the\nbias ratio of $0.85^{+0.37}_{-0.25}$, which is consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM\nprediction. Our galaxy groups have typical masses of $10^{13} M_{\\odot}/h$,\nnaturally complementing previous studies of halo assembly bias on galaxy\ncluster scales.\n", "  This paper determines the existence of Noether symmetry in non-minimally\ncoupled $f(R,T)$ gravity admitting minimal coupling with scalar field models.\nWe consider a generalized spacetime which corresponds to different anisotropic\nand homogeneous universe models. We formulate symmetry generators along with\nconserved quantities through Noether symmetry technique for direct and indirect\ncurvature-matter coupling. For dust and perfect fluids, we evaluate exact\nsolutions and construct their cosmological analysis through some cosmological\nparameters. We conclude that decelerated expansion is obtained for quintessence\nmodel with dust distribution while perfect fluid with dominating potential\nenergy over kinetic energy leads to current cosmic expansion for both phantom\nas well as quintessence models.\n", "  Supermassive black holes are found at the centre of massive galaxies. During\nthe growth of these black holes they light up to become visible as active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and release extraordinary amounts of energy across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. This energy is widely believed to regulate the rate\nof star formation in the black holes' host galaxies via so-called \"AGN\nfeedback\". However, the details of how and when this occurs remains uncertain\nfrom both an observational and theoretical perspective. I review some of the\nobservational results and discuss possible observational signatures of the\nimpact of super-massive black hole growth on star formation.\n", "  White dwarfs (WDs) are powerful tools to study the evolutionary history of\nstars and binaries in the Galaxy. But do we understand their multiplicity from\na theoretical point of view? This can be tested by a comparison with the sample\nof WDs within 20 pc, which is minimally affected by selection biases. From the\nliterature, we compile the available information of the local WD sample with a\nparticular emphasis on their multiplicity, and compare this to synthetic models\nof WD formation in single stars and binaries. As part of our population\nsynthesis approach, we also study the effect of different assumptions\nconcerning the star formation history, binary evolution, and the initial\ndistributions of binary parameters. We find that the observed space densities\nof single and binary WDs are well reproduced by the models. The space densities\nof the most common WD systems (single WDs and unresolved WD-MS binaries) are\nconsistent within a factor two with the observed value. We find a discrepancy\nonly for the space density of resolved double WDs. We exclude that\nobservational selection effects, fast stellar winds, or dynamical interactions\nwith other objects in the Milky Way explain this discrepancy. We find that\neither the initial mass ratio distribution in the Solar neighbourhood is biased\ntowards low mass-ratios, or more than ten resolved DWDs have been missed\nobservationally in the 20 pc sample. Furthermore, we show that the low binary\nfraction of WD systems (~25%) compared to Solartype MS-MS binaries (~50%) is\nconsistent with theory, and is mainly caused by mergers in binary systems, and\nto a lesser degree by WDs hiding in the glare of their companion stars. Lastly,\nGaia will dramatically increase the size of the volume-limited WD sample,\ndetecting the coolest and oldest WDs out to 50 pc. We provide a detailed\nestimate of the number of single and binary WDs in the Gaia sample.\n", "  We have Fourier analyzed 941 K2 light curves of likely members of Praesepe,\nmeasuring periods for 86% and increasing the number of rotation periods (P) by\nnearly a factor of four. The distribution of P vs. (V-K), a mass proxy, has\nthree different regimes: (V-K)<1.3, where the rotation rate rapidly slows as\nmass decreases; 1.3<(V-K)<4.5, where the rotation rate slows more gradually as\nmass decreases; and (V-K)>4.5, where the rotation rate rapidly increases as\nmass decreases. In this last regime, there is a bimodal distribution of\nperiods, with few between $\\sim$2 and $\\sim$10 days. We interpret this to mean\nthat once M stars start to slow down, they do so rapidly. The K2 period-color\ndistribution in Praesepe ($\\sim$790 Myr) is much different than in the Pleiades\n($\\sim$125 Myr) for late F, G, K, and early-M stars; the overall distribution\nmoves to longer periods, and is better described by 2 line segments. For mid-M\nstars, the relationship has similarly broad scatter, and is steeper in\nPraesepe. The diversity of lightcurves and of periodogram types is similar in\nthe two clusters; about a quarter of the periodic stars in both clusters have\nmultiple significant periods. Multi-periodic stars dominate among the higher\nmasses, starting at a bluer color in Praesepe ((V-K)$\\sim$1.5) than in the\nPleiades ((V-K)$\\sim$2.6). In Praesepe, there are relatively more light curves\nthat have two widely separated periods, $\\Delta P >$6 days. Some of these could\nbe examples of M star binaries where one star has spun down but the other has\nnot.\n", "  In this work, we simulate a set of realizations of local volume dark matter\nsubhalo population based on the distributions and relations derived from Via\nLactea II N-body simulation. We calculate the J-factors of these subhalos, and\nfind that the low mass subhalos contribute a lot to the total J-factors.\nCombining with 91 months of the Fermi LAT observation, we constrain on the\ncross section of dark matter annihilating directly to two gamma rays. This is\nthe first work combining numerical simulation results and Fermi LAT\nobservations to constrain dark matter cross section to gamma-ray line with\nsubhalo population. Though the constraints derived from subhalo population are\nweaker than those from Fermi LAT observation of the Galactic center, they are\nsupports of and complementary to these other results.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experiment on a rare-earth material YbMgGaO$_4$ [Y.\nLi \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{115}, 167203 (2015)], which found\nthat the ground state of YbMgGaO$_4$ is a quantum spin liquid, we study the\nground-state phase diagram of an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ model that was proposed\nto describe YbMgGaO$_4$. Using the density-matrix renormalization group method\nin combination with the exact diagonalization, we calculate a variety of\nphysical quantities, including the ground-state energy, the fidelity, the\nentanglement entropy and spin-spin correlation functions. Our studies show that\nin the quantum phase diagram there is a $120^{\\circ}$ phase and two distinct\nstripe phases. The transitions from the two stripe phases to the $120^{\\circ}$\nphase are of the first order. However, the transition between the two stripe\nphases is not the first order, which is different from its classical\ncounterpart. Additionally, we find no evidence for a quantum spin liquid in\nthis model. Our results suggest that additional terms may be also important to\nmodel the material YbMgGaO$_4$. These findings will stimulate further\nexperimental and theoretical works in understanding the quantum spin liquid\nground state in YbMgGaO$_4$.\n", "  An investigation of the {\\alpha}-decay of $^{147}$Sm was performed using an\nultra low-background Twin Frisch-Grid Ionisation Chamber (TF-GIC). Four natural\nsamarium samples were produced using pulsed laser deposition in ultra high\nvacuum. The abundance of the $^{147}$Sm isotope was mea- sured using\ninductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A combined half-life value for\n147Sm of $1.079(26)\\times{}10^{11}$ years was measured. A search for the\n{\\alpha}-decay into the first excited state of $^{143}$Nd has been performed\nusing $\\gamma$-spectroscopy, resulting in a lower half-life limit of $T_{1/2} >\n3.1 \\times{}10^{18}$ years (at 90% C.L.).\n", "  We study the heat transport properties of a chain of coupled quantum harmonic\noscillators in contact at its ends with two heat reservoirs at distinct\ntemperatures. Our approach is based on the use of an evolution equation for the\ndensity operator which is a canonical quantization of the classical\nFokker-Planck-Kramers equation. We set up the evolution equation for the\ncovariances and obtain the stationary covariances at the stationary states from\nwhich we determine the thermal conductance in closed form when the\ninterparticle interaction is small. The conductance is finite in the\nthermodynamic limit implying an infinite thermal conductivity.\n", "  The antiferromagnetic pyrochlore material NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$ is a thermal spin\nliquid over a broad temperature range (~ 140 K down to $T_F = 2.4 $K), in which\nmagnetic correlations between Co$^{2+}$ dipole moments explore a continuous\nmanifold of antiferromagnetic XY states. The thermal spin liquid is interrupted\nby spin freezing at a temperature that is ~ 2 % of the mean field interaction\nstrength, leading to short range static XY clusters with distinctive relaxation\ndynamics. Here we report the low energy inelastic neutron scattering response\nfrom the related compound NaSrCo$_2$F$_7$, confirming that it hosts the same\nstatic and dynamic spin correlations as NaCaCo$_2$F$_7$. We then present the\nsingle-ion levels of Co$^{2+}$ in these materials as measured by inelastic\nneutron scattering. An intermediate spin orbit coupling model applied to an\nensemble of trigonally distorted octahedral crystal fields accounts for the\nobserved transitions. The single-ion ground state of Co$^{2+}$ is a Kramers\ndoublet with a strongly XY-like $g$-tensor ($g_{xy}/g_{z}$ ~ 3). The local\ndisorder inherent from the mixed pyrochlore $A$ sites (Na$^{+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ and\nNa$^{+}$/Sr$^{2+}$) is evident in these measurements as exaggerated broadening\nof some of the levels. A simple model that reproduces the salient features of\nthe single-ion spectrum produces approximately 8.4 % and 4.1 % variation in the\n$z$ and $xy$ components of the $g$-tensor, respectively. This study confirms\nthat an $S_{eff} =1/2$ model with XY antiferromagnetic exchange and weak\nexchange disorder serves as a basic starting point in understanding the low\ntemperature magnetic behavior of these strongly frustrated magnets.\n", "  We present a sample of observations of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts,\nselected for comparison with numerical models. Provided are examples of four\ndistinct cases of thermonuclear ignition: He-ignition in mixed H/He fuel (case\n1 of Fujimoto et al. 1981); He-ignition in pure He fuel, following exhaustion\nof accreted H by steady burning (case 2); ignition in (almost) pure He\naccumulated from an evolved donor in an ultracompact system; and an example of\na superburst, thought to arise from ignition of a layer of carbon fuel produced\nas a by-product of more frequent bursts. For regular bursts, we measured the\nrecurrence time and calculated averaged burst profiles from RXTE observations.\nWe have also estimated the recurrence time for pairs of bursts, including those\nobserved during a transient outburst modelled using a numerical ignition code.\nFor each pair of bursts we list the burst properties including recurrence time,\nfluence and peak flux, the persistent flux level (and inferred accretion rate)\nas well as the ratio of persistent flux to fluence. In the accompanying\nmaterial we provide a bolometric lightcurve for each burst, determined from\ntime-resolved spectral analysis. Along with the inferred or adopted parameters\nfor each burst system, including distance, surface gravity, and redshift, these\ndata are suggested as a suitable test cases for ignition models.\n", "  We have fabricated ferrite cantilevers in which their vibrational properties\ncan be controlled by external magnetic fields. Submicron-scale cantilever\nstructures were made from Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films by physical etching combined\nwith use of a focused ion beam milling technique. We found that the cantilevers\nexhibit two resonance modes which correspond to horizontal and vertical\nvibrations. Under external magnetic fields, the resonance frequency of the\nhorizontal mode increases, while that of the vertical mode decreases,\nquantitatively consistent with our numerical simulation for magnetic forces.\nThe changes in resonance frequencies with magnetic fields reach a few percent,\nshowing that efficient magnetic control of resonance frequencies was achieved.\n", "  We present the theory of a new type of topological quantum order which is\ndriven by the spin-orbit density wave order parameter, and distinguished by\n$Z_2$ topological invariant. We show that when two oppositely polarized chiral\nbands [resulting from the Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling $\\alpha_k$, $k$ is\ncrystal momentum] are significantly nested by a special wavevector ${\\bf\nQ}\\sim(\\pi,0)/(0,\\pi)$, it induces a spatially modulated inversion of the\nchirality ($\\alpha_{k+Q}=\\alpha_k^*$) between different sublattices. The\nresulting quantum order parameters break translational symmetry, but preserve\ntime-reversal symmetry. It is inherently associated with a $Z_2$-topological\ninvariant along each density wave propagation direction. Hence it gives a weak\ntopological insulator in two dimensions, with even number of spin-polarized\nboundary states. This phase is analogous to the quantum spin-Hall state, except\nhere the time-reversal polarization is spatially modulated, and thus it is\ndubbed quantum spin-Hall density wave (QSHDW) state. This order parameter can\nbe realized or engineered in quantum wires, or quasi-2D systems, by tuning the\nspin-orbit couping strength and chemical potential to achieve the special\nnesting condition.\n", "  We report the detection of a dust scattering halo around a recently\ndiscovered X-ray transient, Swift J174540.7-290015, which in early February of\n2016 underwent one of the brightest outbursts (F_X ~ 5e-10 erg/cm^2/s) observed\nfrom a compact object in the Galactic Center field. We analyze four Chandra\nimages that were taken as follow-up observations to Swift discoveries of new\nGalactic Center transients. After adjusting our spectral extraction for the\neffects of detector pileup, we construct a point spread function for each\nobservation and compare it to the GC field before the outburst. We find\nresidual surface brightness around Swift J174540.7-290015, which has a shape\nand temporal evolution consistent with the behavior expected from X-rays\nscattered by foreground dust. We examine the spectral properties of the source,\nwhich shows evidence that the object transitioned from a soft to hard spectral\nstate as it faded below L_X ~ 1e36 erg/s. This behavior is consistent with the\nhypothesis that the object is a low mass X-ray binary in the Galactic Center.\n", "  Regular satellites of giant planets are formed by accretion of solid bodies\nin circumplanetary disks. Planetesimals that are moving on heliocentric orbits\nand are sufficiently large to be decoupled from the flow of the protoplanetary\ngas disk can be captured by gas drag from the circumplanetary disk. In the\npresent work, we examine the distribution of captured planetesimals in\ncircumplanetary disks using orbital integrations. We find that the number of\ncaptured planetesimals reaches an equilibrium state as a balance between\ncontinuous capture and orbital decay into the planet. The number of\nplanetesimals captured into retrograde orbits is much smaller than those on\nprograde orbits, because the former ones experience strong headwind and spiral\ninto the planet rapidly. We find that the surface number density of\nplanetesimals at the current radial location of regular satellites can be\nsignificantly enhanced by gas drag capture, depending on the velocity\ndispersions of planetesimals and the width of the gap in the protoplanetary\ndisk. Using a simple model, we also examine the ratio of the surface densities\nof dust and captured planetesimals in the circumplanetary disk, and find that\nsolid material at the current location of regular satellites can be dominated\nby captured planetesimals when the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is\nrather small and a wide gap is not formed in the protoplanetary disk. In this\ncase, captured planetesimals in such a region can grow by mutual collision\nbefore spiraling into the planet, and would contribute to the growth of regular\nsatellites.\n", "  We revisit the properties of qubits under Lorentz transformations and, by\nconsidering Lorentz invariant quantum states in the Heisenberg formulation,\nclarify some misleading notation that has appeared in the literature on\nrelativistic quantum information theory. We then use this formulation to\nconsider the transformation properties of qubits and density matrices under\nspace-time and gauge transformations. Finally we use our results to understand\nthe behaviour of entanglement between different partitions of quantum systems.\nOur approach not only clarifies the notation, but provides a more intuitive and\nsimple way of gaining insight into the behaviour of relativistic qubits. In\nparticular, it allows us to greatly generalize the results in the current\nliterature as well as substantially simplifying the calculations that are\nneeded.\n", "  The Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational approach with Davydov Ans\\\"atze\nis a sophisticated, yet efficient technique to obtain an acuurate solution to\nmany-body Schr\\\"odinger equations for energy and charge transfer dy- namics in\nmolecular aggregates and light-harvesting complexes. We extend this variational\napproach to finite temperatures dynamics of the spin-boson model by adopting a\nMonte Carlo importance sampling method. In or- der to demonstrate the\napplicability of this approach, we compare real-time quantum dynamics of the\nspin-boson model calculated with that from numerically exact iterative\nquasiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) technique. The comparison shows\nthat our variational approach with the single Davydov Ans\\\"atze is in excellent\nagreement with the QUAPI method at high temperatures, while the two differ at\nlow temperatures. Accuracy in dynamics calculations employing a multitude of\nDavydov trial states is found to improve substantially over the single Davydov\nAnsatz, especially at low temperatures. At a moderate computational cost, our\nvariational approach with the multiple Davydov Ansatz is shown to provide\naccurate spin-boson dynamics over a wide range of temperatures and bath\nspectral densities.\n", "  New classical modalities of atomic force microscopy continue to emerge to\nachieve higher spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution for nanometrology of\nmaterials. Here, we introduce the concept of a quantum mechanical modality that\ncapitalizes on squeezed states of probe displacement. We show that such\nsqueezing is enabled nanomechanically when the probe enters the van der Waals\nregime of interaction with a sample. The effect is studied in the non-contact\nmode, where we consider the parameter domains characterizing the attractive\nregime of the probe-sample interaction force.\n", "  We present a joint analysis of optical emission-line and X-ray observations\nof the archetypical Galactic mixed-morphology supernova remnant (MMSNR) W28\n(G6.4-0.1). MMSNRs comprise a class of sources whose shell-like radio\nmorphology contrasts with a filled center in X-rays; the origin of these\ncontrasting morphologies remains uncertain. Our CTIO images reveal enhanced [S\nII] emission relative to H-alpha along the northern and eastern rims of W28.\nHydroxyl (OH) masers are detected along these same rims, supporting prior\nstudies suggesting that W28 is interacting with molecular clouds at these\nlocations, as observed for several other MMSNRs. Our ROSAT HRI mosaic of W28\nprovides almost complete coverage of the SNR. The X-ray and radio emission is\ngenerally anti-correlated, except for the luminous northeastern rim, which is\nprominent in both bands. Our Chandra observation sampled the X-ray-luminous\ncentral diffuse emission. Spectra extracted from the bright central peak and\nfrom nearby annular regions are best fit with two over-ionized recombining\nplasma models. We also find that while the X-ray emission from the central peak\nis dominated by swept-up material, that from the surrounding regions shows\nevidence for oxygen-rich ejecta, suggesting that W28 was produced by a massive\nprogenitor. We also analyze the X-ray properties of two X-ray sources (CXOU\nJ175857.55-233400.3 and 3XMM J180058.5-232735) projected into the interior of\nW28 and conclude that neither is a neutron star associated with the SNR. The\nformer is likely to be a foreground cataclysmic variable or a quiescent\nlow-mass X-ray-binary while the latter is likely to be a coronally-active main\nsequence star.\n", "  We present $Chandra$ observations of seven broad absorption line (BAL)\nquasars at $z=0.863$-2.516 with redshifted BAL troughs (RSBALs). Five of our\nseven targets were detected by $Chandra$ in 4-13 ks exposures with ACIS-S. The\n$\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ values, $\\Delta\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ values, and spectral energy\ndistributions of our targets demonstrate they are all X-ray weak relative to\nexpectations for non-BAL quasars, and the degree of X-ray weakness is\nconsistent with that of appropriately-matched BAL quasars generally.\nFurthermore, our five detected targets show evidence for hard X-ray spectral\nshapes with a stacked effective power-law photon index of $\\Gamma_{\\rm\neff}=0.5^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$. These findings support the presence of heavy X-ray\nabsorption ($N_{\\rm H}\\approx 2 \\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) in RSBAL quasars,\nlikely by the shielding gas found to be common in BAL quasars more generally.\nWe use these X-ray measurements to assess models for the nature of RSBAL\nquasars, finding that a rotationally-dominated outflow model is favored while\nan infall model also remains plausible with some stipulations. The X-ray data\ndisfavor a binary quasar model for RSBAL quasars in general.\n", "  We study the nonlinearity (NL) in the conversion from charge to voltage in\ninfrared detectors (HXRG) for use in precision astronomy. We present laboratory\nmeasurements of the NL function of a H2RG detector and discuss the accuracy to\nwhich it would need to be calibrated in future space missions to perform\ncosmological measurements through the weak gravitational lensing technique. In\naddition, we present an analysis of archival data from the infrared H1RG\ndetector of the Wide Field Camera 3 in the Hubble Space Telescope that provides\nevidence consistent with the existence of a sensor effect analogous to the\nbrighter-fatter effect found in Charge-Coupled Devices. We propose a model in\nwhich this effect could be understood as shifts in the effective pixel\nboundaries, and discuss prospects of laboratory measurements to fully\ncharacterize this effect.\n", "  We investigate nucleosynthesis in tidal disruption events (TDEs) of white\ndwarfs (WDs) by intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). We consider various\ntypes of WDs with different masses and compositions by means of 3 dimensional\n(3D) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We model these WDs with\ndifferent numbers of SPH particles, $N$, from a few $10^4$ to a few $10^7$, in\norder to check mass resolution convergence, where SPH simulations with $N>10^7$\n(or a space resolution of several $10^6$ cm) have unprecedentedly high\nresolution in this kind of simulations. We find that nuclear reactions become\nless active with increasing $N$, and that these nuclear reactions are excited\nby spurious heating due to low resolution. Moreover, we find no shock wave\ngeneration. In order to investigate the reason for the absence of a shock wave,\nwe additionally perform 1 dimensional (1D) SPH and mesh-based simulations with\na space resolution ranging from $10^4$ to $10^7$ cm, using characteristic flow\nstructure extracted from the 3D SPH simulations. We find shock waves in these\n1D high-resolution simulations. One of these shock waves triggers a detonation\nwave. However, we have to be careful of the fact that, if the shock wave\nemerged at a bit outer region, it could not trigger the detonation wave due to\nlow density. Note that the 1D initial conditions lack accuracy to precisely\ndetermine where a shock wave emerges. We need to perform 3D simulations with\n$\\lesssim 10^6$ cm space resolution in order to conclude that WD TDEs become\noptical transients powered by radioactive nuclei.\n", "  The energy bandgap is an intrinsic character of semiconductors, which largely\ndetermines their properties. The ability to continuously and reversibly tune\nthe bandgap of a single device during real time operation is of great\nimportance not only to device physics but also to technological applications.\nHere we demonstrate a widely tunable bandgap of few-layer black phosphorus (BP)\nby the application of vertical electric field in dual-gated BP field-effect\ntransistors. A total bandgap reduction of 124 meV is observed when the\nelectrical displacement field is increased from 0.10V/nm to 0.83V/nm. Our\nresults suggest appealing potential for few-layer BP as a tunable bandgap\nmaterial in infrared optoelectronics, thermoelectric power generation and\nthermal imaging.\n", "  Properties of the vortex state in helical p-wave superconductor are studied\nby the quasi-classical Eilenberger theory. We confirm the instability of the\nhelical p-wave state at high fields and that the spin-polarized local density\nof states M(E,r) appears even when Knight shift does not change. This is\nbecause the vorticity couples to the chirality of up-spin pair or down-spin\npair of the helical state. In order to identify the helical p-wave state at low\nfields, we investigate the structure of the zero-energy M (E = 0, r) in the\nvortex states, and also the energy spectra of M (E, r).\n", "  Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials at low temperatures are\ngoverned by the interaction between phonons and localized excitations referred\nto as tunneling two level systems (TLS). The temperature variation of the\nthermal conductivity of these amorphous materials is considered as universal\nand is characterized by a quadratic power law. This is well described by the\nphenomenological TLS model even though its microscopic explanation is still\nelusive. Here, by scaling down to the nanometer scale amorphous systems much\nbelow the bulk phonon-TLS mean free path, we probed the robustness of that\nmodel in restricted geometry systems. Using very sensitive thermal conductance\nmeasurements, we demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the thermal\nconductance of silicon nitride nanostructures remains mostly quadratic\nindependently of the nanowire section. It is not following the cubic power law\nin temperature as expected in a Casimir-Ziman regime of boundary limited\nthermal transport. This shows a thermal transport counter intuitively dominated\nby phonon-TLS interactions and not by phonon-boundary scattering in the\nnanowires. This could be ascribed to an unexpected high density of TLS on the\nsurfaces which still dominates the phonon diffusion processes at low\ntemperatures and explains why the universal quadratic temperature dependence of\nthermal conductance still holds for amorphous nanowires.\n", "  We report that the lowest energy transverse-optic phonon in metallic SnTe\nsoftens to near zero energy at the structural transition at $T_C=75 \\text{~K}$\nand importantly show that the energy of this mode below $T_C$ increases as the\ntemperature decreases. Since the mode is a polar displacement this proves\nunambiguously that SnTe undergoes a ferroelectric displacement below $T_C$.\nConcentration gradients and imperfect stoichiometry in large crystals may\nexplain why this was not seen in previous inelastic neutron scattering studies.\nDespite SnTe being metallic we find that the ferroelectric transition is\nsimilar to that in ferroelectric insulators, unmodified by the presence of\nconduction electrons: we find that (i) the damping of the polar mode is\ndominated by coupling to acoustic phonons rather than electron-phonon coupling\n(ii) the transition is almost an ideal continuous transition (iii) comparison\nwith density functional calculations identifies the importance of\ndipolar-dipolar screening for understanding this behaviour.\n", "  Kramers problem for a dimer in a bistable piecewise linear potential is\nstudied in the presence of correlated noise processes. The distribution of\nfirst passage times from one minima to the basin of attraction of the other\nminima is found to have exponentially decaying tails with the parameter\ndependent on the amount of correlation and the coupling between the particles.\nStrong coupling limit of the problem is analyzed using adiabatic elimination,\nwhere it is found that the initial probability density relaxes towards\nstationary value on the same time scale as the mean escape time. The\nimplications towards polymer dynamics in a potential are discussed.\n", "  We explore the effects of the expected higher cosmic ray (CR) ionization\nrates $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$ on the abundances of carbon monoxide (CO), atomic carbon\n(C), and ionized carbon (C$^+$) in the H$_2$ clouds of star-forming galaxies.\nThe study of Bisbas et al. (2015) is expanded by: a) using realistic\ninhomogeneous Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) structures, b) a detailed chemical\nanalysis behind the CR-induced destruction of CO, and c) exploring the thermal\nstate of CR-irradiated molecular gas. CRs permeating the interstellar medium\nwith $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$$\\gtrsim 10\\times$(Galactic) are found to significantly\nreduce the [CO]/[H$_2$] abundance ratios throughout the mass of a GMC. CO\nrotational line imaging will then show much clumpier structures than the actual\nones. For $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$$\\gtrsim 100\\times$(Galactic) this bias becomes\nsevere, limiting the utility of CO lines for recovering structural and\ndynamical characteristics of H$_2$-rich galaxies throughout the Universe,\nincluding many of the so-called Main Sequence (MS) galaxies where the bulk of\ncosmic star formation occurs. Both C$^+$ and C abundances increase with rising\n$\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$, with C remaining the most abundant of the two throughout\nH$_2$ clouds, when $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}\\sim (1-100)\\times$(Galactic). C$^+$ starts\nto dominate for $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$$\\gtrsim 10^3\\times$(Galactic). The thermal\nstate of the gas in the inner and denser regions of GMCs is invariant with\n$T_{\\rm gas}\\sim 10\\,{\\rm K}$ for $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}\\sim (1-10)\\times$(Galactic).\nFor $\\zeta_{\\rm CR}$$\\sim 10^3\\times$(Galactic) this is no longer the case and\n$T_{\\rm gas}\\sim 30-50\\,{\\rm K}$ are reached. Finally we identify OH as the key\nspecies whose $T_{\\rm gas}-$sensitive abundance could mitigate the destruction\nof CO at high temperatures.\n", "  Dry Dilution Refrigerators (DDR) based on pulse tube cryo-coolers have\nstarted to replace Wet Dilution Refrigerators (WDR) due to the ease and low\ncost of operation. However these advantages come at the cost of increased\nvibrations, induced by the pulse tube. In this work, we present the vibration\nmeasurements performed on three different commercial DDRs. We describe in\ndetail the vibration measurement system we assembled, based on commercial\naccelerometers, conditioner and DAQ, and examined the effects of the various\ndamping solutions utilized on three different DDRs, both in the low and high\nfrequency regions. Finally, we ran low temperature, pseudo-massive (30 and 250\ng) germanium bolometers in the best vibration-performing system under study and\nreport on the results.\n", "  We present additional magic wavelengths ($\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$) for the\nclock transitions in the alkaline-earth metal ions considering circular\npolarized light aside from our previously reported values in [J. Kaur et al.,\nPhys. Rev. A {\\bf 92}, 031402(R) (2015)] for the linearly polarized light.\nContributions from the vector component to the dynamic dipole polarizabilities\n($\\alpha_d(\\omega)$) of the atomic states associated with the clock transitions\nplay major roles in the evaluation of these $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$, hence\nfacilitating in choosing circular polarization of lasers in the experiments.\nMoreover, the actual clock transitions in these ions are carried out among the\nhyperfine levels. The $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$ values in these hyperfine\ntransitions are estimated and found to be different from $\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$\nfor the atomic transitions due to different contributions coming from the\nvector and tensor part of $\\alpha_d(\\omega)$. Importantly, we also present\n$\\lambda_{\\rm{magic}}$ values that depend only on the scalar component of\n$\\alpha_d(\\omega)$ for their uses in a specially designed trap geometry for\nthese ions so that they can be used unambiguously among any hyperfine levels of\nthe atomic states of the clock transitions. We also present $\\alpha_d(\\omega)$\nvalues explicitly at the 1064 nm for the atomic states associated with the\nclock transitions which may be useful for creating \"high-field seeking\" traps\nfor the above ions using the Nd:YAG laser. The tune out wavelengths at which\nthe states would be free from the Stark shifts are also presented. Accurate\nvalues of the electric dipole matrix elements required for these studies are\ngiven and trends of electron correlation effects in determining them are also\nhighlighted.\n", "  We analyze a sample of $z$-dropout galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS South and\nUDS fields that have been targeted by a dedicated spectroscopic campaign aimed\nat detecting their Ly$\\alpha$ line. Deep IRAC observations at 3.6 and 4.5\n$\\mu$m are used to determine the strength of optical emission lines affecting\nthese bands at z$\\sim$6.5-6.9 in order to i) investigate possible physical\ndifferences between Ly$\\alpha$ emitting and non-emitting sources; ii) constrain\nthe escape fraction of ionizing photons; iii) provide an estimate of the\nspecific star-formation rate at high redshifts. We find evidence of strong\n[OIII]+H$\\beta$ emission in the average (stacked) SEDs of galaxies both with\nand without Ly$\\alpha$ emission. The blue IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] color of the stack\nwith detected Ly$\\alpha$ line can be converted into a rest-frame equivalent\nwidth EW([OIII]+H$\\beta$)=1500$^{+530}_{-440}\\AA$ assuming a flat intrinsic\nstellar continuum. This strong optical line emission enables a first estimate\nof f$_{esc}\\lesssim$20% on the escape fraction of ionizing photons from\nLy$\\alpha$ detected objects. The objects with no Ly$\\alpha$ line show less\nextreme EW([OIII]+H$\\beta$)=520$^{+170}_{-150}\\AA$ suggesting different\nphysical conditions of the HII regions with respect to Ly$\\alpha$-emitting\nones, or a larger f$_{esc}$. The latter case is consistent with a combined\nevolution of f$_{esc}$ and the neutral hydrogen fraction as an explanation of\nthe lack of bright Ly$\\alpha$ emission at z$>$6. A lower limit on the specific\nstar formation rate, SSFR$>$9.1$Gyr^{-1}$ for $M_{star}=2 \\times 10^9\nM_{\\odot}$ galaxies at these redshifts can be derived from the\nspectroscopically confirmed sample.\n", "  We investigate the formation of circumstellar disks and outflows subsequent\nto the collapse of molecular cloud cores with the magnetic field and\nturbulence. Numerical simulations are performed by using an adaptive mesh\nrefinement to follow the evolution up to $\\sim 1000$~yr after the formation of\na protostar. In the simulations, circumstellar disks are formed around the\nprotostars; those in magnetized models are considerably smaller than those in\nnonmagnetized models, but their size increases with time. The models with\nstronger magnetic field tends to produce smaller disks. During evolution in the\nmagnetized models, the mass ratios of a disk to a protostar is approximately\nconstant at $\\sim 1-10$\\%. The circumstellar disks are aligned according to\ntheir angular momentum, and the outflows accelerate along the magnetic field on\nthe $10-100$~au scale; this produces a disk that is misaligned with the\noutflow. The outflows are classified into two types: a magneto-centrifugal wind\nand a spiral flow. In the latter, because of the geometry, the axis of rotation\nis misaligned with the magnetic field. The magnetic field has an internal\nstructure in the cloud cores, which also causes misalignment between the\noutflows and the magnetic field on the scale of the cloud core. The\ndistribution of the angular momentum vectors in a core also has a non-monotonic\ninternal structure. This should create a time-dependent accretion of angular\nmomenta onto the circumstellar disk. Therefore, the circumstellar disks are\nexpected to change their orientation as well as their sizes in the long-term\nevolutions.\n", "  We present the detection of supermassive black holes (BHs) in two Virgo\nultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs), VUCD3 and M59cO. We use adaptive optics\nassisted data from the Gemini/NIFS instrument to derive radial velocity\ndispersion profiles for both objects. Mass models for the two UCDs are created\nusing multi-band Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, including the modeling\nof mild color gradients seen in both objects. We then find a best-fit stellar\nmass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) and BH mass by combining the kinematic data and the\ndeprojected stellar mass profile using Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). Assuming\naxisymmetric isotropic Jeans models, we detect BHs in both objects with masses\nof $4.4^{+2.5}_{-3.0} \\times 10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$ in VUCD3 and $5.8^{+2.5}_{-2.8}\n\\times 10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$ in M59cO (3$\\sigma$ uncertainties). The BH mass is\ndegenerate with the anisotropy parameter, $\\beta_z$; for the data to be\nconsistent with no BH requires $\\beta_z = 0.4$ and $\\beta_z = 0.6$ for VUCD3\nand M59cO, respectively. Comparing these values with nuclear star clusters\nshows that while it is possible that these UCDs are highly radially\nanisotropic, it seems unlikely. These detections constitute the second and\nthird UCDs known to host supermassive BHs. They both have a high fraction of\ntheir total mass in their BH; $\\sim$13% for VUCD3 and $\\sim$18% for M59cO. They\nalso have low best-fit stellar $M/L$s, supporting the proposed scenario that\nmost massive UCDs host high mass fraction BHs. The properties of the BHs and\nUCDs are consistent with both objects being the tidally stripped remnants of\n$\\sim$10$^9$ M$_\\odot$ galaxies.\n", "  We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm\ncontinuum observations of the SR 24S transition disk with an angular resolution\n$\\lesssim0.18\"$ (12 au radius). We perform a multi-wavelength investigation by\ncombining new data with previous ALMA data at 0.45 mm. The visibilities and\nimages of the continuum emission at the two wavelengths are well characterized\nby a ring-like emission. Visibility modeling finds that the ring-like emission\nis narrower at longer wavelengths, in good agreement with models of dust\ntrapping in pressure bumps, although there are complex residuals that suggest\npotentially asymmetric structures. The 0.45 mm emission has a shallower profile\ninside the central cavity than the 1.3 mm emission. In addition, we find that\nthe $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (J=2-1) emission peaks at the center of the\ncontinuum cavity. We do not detect either continuum or gas emission from the\nnorthern companion to this system (SR 24N), which is itself a binary system.\nThe upper limit for the dust disk mass of SR 24N is $\\lesssim\n0.12\\,M_{\\bigoplus}$, which gives a disk mass ratio in dust between the two\ncomponents of $M_{\\mathrm{dust, SR\\,24S}}/M_{\\mathrm{dust,\nSR\\,24N}}\\gtrsim840$. The current ALMA observations may imply that either\nplanets have already formed in the SR 24N disk or that dust growth to mm-sizes\nis inhibited there and that only warm gas, as seen by ro-vibrational CO\nemission inside the truncation radii of the binary, is present.\n", "  We use $>$9400 $\\log(m/M_{\\odot})>10$ quiescent and star-forming galaxies at\n$z\\lesssim2$ in COSMOS/UltraVISTA to study the average size evolution of these\nsystems, with focus on the rare, ultra-massive population at\n$\\log(m/M_{\\odot})>11.4$. The large 2-square degree survey area delivers a\nsample of $\\sim400$ such ultra-massive systems. Accurate sizes are derived\nusing a calibration based on high-resolution images from the Hubble Space\nTelescope. We find that, at these very high masses, the size evolution of\nstar-forming and quiescent galaxies is almost indistinguishable in terms of\nnormalization and power-law slope. We use this result to investigate possible\npathways of quenching massive $m>M^*$ galaxies at $z<2$. We consistently model\nthe size evolution of quiescent galaxies from the star-forming population by\nassuming different simple models for the suppression of star-formation. These\nmodels include an instantaneous and delayed quenching without altering the\nstructure of galaxies and a central starburst followed by compaction. We find\nthat instantaneous quenching reproduces well the observed mass-size relation of\nmassive galaxies at $z>1$. Our starburst$+$compaction model followed by\nindividual growth of the galaxies by minor mergers is preferred over other\nmodels without structural change for $\\log(m/M_{\\odot})>11.0$ galaxies at\n$z>0.5$. None of our models is able to meet the observations at $m>M^*$ and\n$z<1$ with out significant contribution of post-quenching growth of individual\ngalaxies via mergers. We conclude that quenching is a fast process in galaxies\nwith $ m \\ge 10^{11} M_\\odot$, and that major mergers likely play a major role\nin the final steps of their evolution.\n", "  How the time evolution which is typical for classical cosmology emerges from\nquantum cosmology? The answer is not trivial because the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation is time independent. A framework associating the quantum\nHamilton-Jacobi to the minisuperspace cosmological models has been introduced\nin [1]. In this paper, we show that time dependence and quantum-classical\ncorrespondence both arise naturally in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism of\nquantum mechanics applied to quantum cosmology. We study the quantum\nHamilton-Jacobi cosmology of spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic early\nuniverse whose matter content is a perfect fluid. The classical cosmology\nemerge around one Planck time where its linear size is around a few millimeter,\nwithout needing any classical inflationary phase afterwards to make it grow to\nits present size.\n", "  ${}^{20}\\mathrm{O}(d,p){}^{21}\\mathrm{O}$ transfer reactions are described\nusing momentum-space Faddeev-type equations for transition operators and\nincluding the vibrational excitation of the ${}^{20}\\mathrm{O}$ core. The\navailable experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for\nthe ${}^{21}\\mathrm{O}$ ground state $\\frac52^+$ and excited state $\\frac12^+$\nare quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation.\nIts effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section\nby the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the\nspectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle\ncross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher\nenergies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple\nrelation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are\nqualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum\ntransfer $\\ell=0$ and $\\ell=2$, suppressing the cross sections for the former\nand enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution\nin both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a\ncomplicated interplay between its contributions of the two- and three-body\nnature.\n", "  Small lattice polarons driven by strong external electric fields are\nconsidered. A time-dependent Schroedinger equation is integrated directly in\ntime domain. The field agitates ions both directly and through modulation of\ncarrier density. It is found that when the field is in resonance with local ion\noscillations, the polaron is liberated from its self-induced trap and the\ntunneling frequency increases exponentially.\n", "  A $\\Sigma^*$ state with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^-$ with mass and width around\n$1380$ MeV and $120$ MeV, refereed to as the $\\Sigma^*_{1/2^-}(1380)$, has been\npredicted in several pentaquark models and inferred from the analysis of CLAS\n$\\gamma p$ data. In the present work, we discuss how one can employ the\n$\\Lambda^+_c \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\Lambda$ decay to test its existence, as well as to\nstudy the $\\Sigma^*(1385)$ state with $J^P = 3/2^+$. Because the final $\\pi^+\n\\Lambda$ system is in a pure isospin $I = 1$ combination, the $\\Lambda^+_c \\to\n\\eta \\pi^+ \\Lambda$ decay can be an ideal process to study these $\\Sigma^*$\nresonances. In particular, we show that the decay angle and energy\ndistributions of the $\\pi^+$ are very different for $\\Sigma^*(1385)$ and\n$\\Sigma^*_{1/2^-}(1380)$. The proposed decay mechanism as well as the existence\nof the $\\Sigma^*_{1/2^-}(1380)$ state can be checked by future BESIII and Belle\nexperiments.\n", "  A method is suggested for calculating the critical temperature in\nmulticomponent field theory with weak interactions. The method is based on\nself-similar approximation theory allowing for the extrapolation of series in\npowers of asymptotically small coupling to finite and even infinite couplings.\nThe extrapolation for the critical temperature employs self-similar factor\napproximants. The found results are in perfect agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n", "  HD 189733 b is one of the most well-studied exoplanets due to its large\ntransit depth and host star brightness. The focus on this object has produced a\nnumber of high-cadence transit observations using high-resolution optical\nspectrographs. Here we present an analysis of seven full H$\\alpha$ transits of\nHD 189733 b using HARPS on the 3.6 meter La Silla telescope and HIRES on Keck\nI, taken over the course of nine years from 2006 to 2015. H$\\alpha$\ntransmission signals are analyzed as a function of the stellar activity level,\nas measured using the normalized core flux of the Ca II H and K lines. We find\nstrong variations in the strength of the H$\\alpha$ transmission spectrum from\nepoch to epoch. However, there is no clear trend between the Ca II core\nemission and the strength of the in-transit H$\\alpha$ signal, although the\ntransit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the\nmost active. We present simulations of the in-transit contrast effect and find\nthat the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong\nfacular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line\nstrengths. We also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of\nplanetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due\nto large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet. Overall, we find it\nmore likely that the measured H$\\alpha$ signals arise in the extended planetary\natmosphere, although a better understanding of active region emission for\nactive stars such as HD 189733 are needed.\n", "  Multiwavelength followup of unidentified Fermi sources has vastly expanded\nthe number of known galactic-field \"black widow\" and \"redback\" millisecond\npulsar binaries. Focusing on their rotation-powered state, we interpret the\nradio to X-ray phenomenology in a consistent framework. We advocate the\nexistence of two distinct modes differing in their intrabinary shock\norientation, distinguished by the phase-centering of the double-peaked X-ray\norbital modulation originating from mildly-relativistic Doppler boosting. By\nconstructing a geometric model for radio eclipses, we constrain the shock\ngeometry as functions of binary inclination and shock stand-off $R_0$. We\ndevelop synthetic X-ray synchrotron orbital light curves and explore the model\nparameter space allowed by radio eclipse constraints applied on archetypal\nsystems B1957+20 and J1023+0038. For B1957+20, from radio eclipses the\nstand-off is $R_0 \\sim 0.15$ -- $0.3$ fraction of binary separation from the\ncompanion center, depending on the orbit inclination. Constructed X-ray light\ncurves for B1957+20 using these values are qualitatively consistent with those\nobserved, and we find occultation of the shock by the companion as a minor\ninfluence, demanding significant Doppler factors to yield double peaks. For\nJ1023+0038, radio eclipses imply $R_0 \\lesssim 0.4$ while X-ray light curves\nsuggest $0.1\\lesssim R_0 \\lesssim 0.3$ (from the pulsar). Degeneracies in the\nmodel parameter space encourage further development to include transport\nconsiderations. Generically, the spatial variation along the shock of the\nunderlying electron power-law index should yield energy-dependence in the shape\nof light curves motivating future X-ray phase-resolved spectroscopic studies to\nprobe the unknown physics of pulsar winds and relativistic shock acceleration\ntherein.\n", "  We provide an updated calibration of CIV $\\lambda1549$ broad emission\nline-based single-epoch (SE) black hole (BH) mass estimators for active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) using new data for six reverberation-mapped AGNs at\nredshift $z=0.005-0.028$ with BH masses (bolometric luminosities) in the range\n$10^{6.5}-10^{7.5}$ $M_{\\odot}$ ($10^{41.7}-10^{43.8}$ erg s$^{\\rm -1}$). New\nrest-frame UV-to-optical spectra covering 1150-5700 \\AA\\ for the six AGNs were\nobtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Multi-component spectral\ndecompositions of the HST spectra were used to measure SE emission-line widths\nfor the CIV, MgII, and H$\\beta$ lines as well as continuum luminosities in the\nspectral region around each line. We combine the new data with similar\nmeasurements for a previous archival sample of 25 AGNs to derive the most\nconsistent and accurate calibrations of the CIV-based SE BH mass estimators\nagainst the H$\\beta$ reverberation-based masses, using three different measures\nof broad-line width: full-width at half maximum (FWHM), line dispersion\n($\\sigma_{\\rm line}$) and mean absolute deviation (MAD). The newly expanded\nsample at redshift $z=0.005-0.234$ covers a dynamic range in BH mass\n(bolometric luminosity) of $\\log\\ M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot} = 6.5-9.1$ ($\\log\\\nL_{\\rm bol}/$erg s$^{\\rm -1}=41.7-46.9$), and we derive the new CIV-based mass\nestimators using a Bayesian linear regression analysis over this range. We\ngenerally recommend the use of $\\sigma_{\\rm line}$ or MAD rather than FWHM to\nobtain a less biased velocity measurement of the CIV emission line, because its\nnarrow-line component contribution is difficult to decompose from the\nbroad-line profile.\n", "  Recent SECCHI COR2 observations on board STEREO-A spacecraft have detected\ndensity structures at a distance of 2.5--15~R propagating with periodicity of\nabout 90~minutes. The observations show that the density structures probably\nformed in the lower corona. We used the large Ukrainian radio telescope URAN-2\nto observe type IV radio bursts in the frequency range of 8--32~MHz during the\ntime interval of 08:15--11:00~UT on August 1, 2011. Radio emission in this\nfrequency range originated at the distance of 1.5--2.5 R according to the\nBaumbach-Allen density model of the solar corona. Morlet wavelet analysis\nshowed the periodicity of 80~min in radio emission intensity at all\nfrequencies, which demonstrates that there are quasi-periodic variations of\ncoronal density at all heights. The observed periodicity corresponds to the\nacoustic cut-off frequency of stratified corona at a temperature of 1~MK. We\nsuggest that continuous perturbations of the coronal base in the form of\njets/explosive events generate acoustic pulses, which propagate upwards and\nleave the wake behind oscillating at the coronal cut-off frequency. This wake\nmay transform into recurrent shocks due to the density decrease with height,\nwhich leads to the observed periodicity in the radio emission. The recurrent\nshocks may trigger quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection in helmet streamers,\nwhere the opposite field lines merge and consequently may generate periodic\ndensity structures observed in the solar wind.\n", "  Macrocycles have attracted much attention due to their specific \"endless\"\ntopology, which results in extraordinary properties compared to related linear\n(open-chain) molecules. However, challenges still remain in their controlled\nsynthesis with well-defined constitution and geometry. Here, we report the\nfirst successful application of the (pseudo-)high dilution method to the\nconditions of on-surface synthesis in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). This approach\nleads to high yields (up to 84%) of cyclic hyperbenzene ([18]-honeycombene) via\nan Ullmann-type reaction from 4,4\"-dibromo-meta-terphenyl (DMTP) as precursor\non a Ag(111) surface. The mechanism of macrocycle formation was explored in\ndetail using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and X-ray photoemission\nspectroscopy (XPS). We propose that hyperbenzene (MTP)6 forms majorly by\nstepwise desilverization of an organometallic (MTP-Ag)6 macrocycle, which\npreforms via cyclisation of (MTP-Ag)6 chains under pseudo-high dilution\ncondition. The high probability of cyclisation on the stage of the\norganometallic phase results from the reversibility of the C-Ag bond. The case\nis different from that in solution, in which cyclisation typically occurs on\nthe stage of covalently bonded open-chain precursor. This difference in the\ncyclisation mechanism on a surface compared to that in solution stems mainly\nfrom the 2D confinement exerted by the surface template, which to a large\nextent prevents the flipping of chain segments necessary for cyclisation.\n", "  Simultaneous, high-quality measurements of the neutral helium triplet\nfeatures at 5876~\\AA\\ and 10830~\\AA, respectively, in a sample of solar-type\nstars are presented. The observations were made with ESO telescopes at the La\nSilla Paranal Observatory under program ID 088.D-0028(A) and MPG Utility Run\nfor FEROS 088.A-9029(A). The equivalent widths of these features combined with\nchromospheric models are utilized to infer the fractional area coverage, or\nfilling factor, of magnetic regions outside of spots. We find that the majority\nof the sample is characterized by filling factors less than unity. However,\ndiscrepancies occur among the coolest K-type and warmest and most rapidly\nrotating F-type dwarf stars. We discuss these apparently anomalous results and\nfind that in the case of K-type stars they are an artifact of the application\nof chromospheric models best suited to the Sun than to stars with significantly\nlower $T_\\mathrm{eff}$. The case of the F-type rapid rotators can be explained\nwith the measurement uncertainties of the equivalent widths, but they may also\nbe due to a non-magnetic heating component in their atmospheres. With the\nexceptions noted above, preliminary results suggest that the average heating\nrates in the active regions are the same from one star to the other, differing\nin the spatially integrated, observed level of activity due to the area\ncoverage. Hence, differences in activity in this sample are mainly due to the\nfilling factor of active regions.\n", "  The AGILE satellite detected transient high-energy gamma-ray emission from\nthe X-ray binary V404 Cygni, during the June 2015 outburst observed in radio,\noptical, X-ray and soft gamma-ray frequencies. The activity was observed by\nAGILE in the 50-400 MeV energy band, between 2015-06-24 UT 06:00:00 and\n2015-06-26 UT 06:00:00 (MJD 57197.25 - 57199.25), with a detection significance\nof ${\\sim}4.3{\\sigma}$. The gamma-ray detection, consistent with a\ncontemporaneous observation by Fermi-LAT, is correlated with a bright flare\nobserved at radio and hard X-ray frequencies, and with a strong enhancement of\nthe 511 keV line emission, possibly indicating plasmoid ejections in a\nlepton-dominated transient jet. The AGILE observations of this binary system\nare compatible with a microquasar scenario in which transient jets are\nresponsible for the high-energy gamma-ray emission.\n", "  We show that the nonlinear $\\sigma-$model in an asymptotically $AdS_3$\nspace-time admits a novel local symmetry. The field action is assumed to be\nquartic in the nonlinear $\\sigma-$model fields and minimally coupled to\ngravity. The local symmetry transformation simultaneously twists the nonlinear\n$\\sigma-$model fields and changes the space-time metric, and it can be used to\nmap an extremal $BTZ$ black hole to infinitely many hairy black hole solutions.\n", "  We present observations and analysis of the low-mass star-forming region,\nTaurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). CS ($J$=2-1)/N$_2$H$^+$ ($J$=1-0) and\nC$^{17}$O ($J$=2-1)/C$^{18}$O ($J$=2-1) were observed with FCRAO (Five College\nRadio Astronomy Observatory) and SRAO (Seoul Radio Astronomy Observatory),\nrespectively. In addition, Spitzer infrared data and 1.2 mm continuum data\nobserved with MAMBO (Max-Planck Millimetre Bolometer) are used. We also perform\nchemical modeling to investigate the relative molecular distributions of the\nTMC-1 filament. Based on Spitzer observations, there is no young stellar object\nalong the TMC-1 filament, while five Class II and one Class I young stellar\nobjects are identified outside the filament. The comparison between column\ndensities calculated from dust continuum and C$^{17}$O 2-1 line emission shows\nthat CO is depleted much more significantly in the ammonia peak than in the\ncyanopolyyne peak, while the column densities calculated from the dust\ncontinuum are similar at the two peaks. N$_2$H$^+$ is not depleted much in\neither peak. According to our chemical calculation, the differential chemical\ndistribution in the two peaks can be explained by different timescales required\nto reach the same density, i.e., by different dynamical processes.\n", "  We surveyed a central 0.6 deg^2 region of Abell 1367 cluster for extended\nionized gas clouds (EIGs) using the Subaru prime-focus camera (Suprime-Cam)\nwith a narrow-band filter that covers Halpha. We discovered six new EIGs in\naddition to five known EIGs. We also found that the Halpha tail from the blue\ninfalling group (BIG) is extended to about 330 kpc in projected distance, which\nis about twice longer than previously reported. Candidates of star-forming\nblobs in the tail are detected. The properties of the EIG parent galaxies in\nAbell 1367 basically resemble those in the Coma cluster. A noticeable\ndifference is that the number of detached EIGs is significantly fewer in Abell\n1367, while the fraction of blue member galaxies is higher. The results suggest\na difference in the evolutionary stage of the clusters; Abell 1367 is at an\nearlier stage than the Coma cluster.\n", "  Employing a simplified version of the Israel-Stewart formalism for\ngeneral-relativistic shear-viscous hydrodynamics, we perform axisymmetric\ngeneral-relativistic simulations for a rotating neutron star surrounded by a\nmassive torus, which can be formed from differentially rotating stars. We show\nthat with our choice of a shear-viscous hydrodynamics formalism, the\nsimulations can be stably performed for a long time scale. We also demonstrate\nthat with a possibly high shear-viscous coefficient, not only viscous angular\nmomentum transport works but also an outflow could be driven from a hot\nenvelope around the neutron star for a time scale $\\gtrsim 100\\,$ms with the\nejecta mass $\\gtrsim 10^{-2}M_\\odot$ which is comparable to the typical mass\nfor dynamical ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. This suggests that massive\nneutron stars surrounded by a massive torus, which are typical outcomes formed\nafter the merger of binary neutron stars, could be the dominant source for\nproviding neutron-rich ejecta, if the effective shear viscosity is sufficiently\nhigh, i.e., if the viscous $\\alpha$ parameter is $\\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. The present\nnumerical result indicates the importance of a future high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulation that is the unique approach to clarify the\nviscous effect in the merger remnants of binary neutron stars by the\nfirst-principle manner.\n", "  We measure the mass function for a sample of 840 young star clusters with\nages between 10-300 Myr observed by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury\n(PHAT) survey in M31. The data show clear evidence of a high-mass truncation:\nonly 15 clusters more massive than $10^4$ $M_{\\odot}$ are observed, compared to\n$\\sim$100 expected for a canonical $M^{-2}$ pure power-law mass function with\nthe same total number of clusters above the catalog completeness limit.\nAdopting a Schechter function parameterization, we fit a characteristic\ntruncation mass of $M_c = 8.5^{+2.8}_{-1.8} \\times 10^3$ $M_{\\odot}$. While\nprevious studies have measured cluster mass function truncations, the\ncharacteristic truncation mass we measure is the lowest ever reported.\nCombining this M31 measurement with previous results, we find that the cluster\nmass function truncation correlates strongly with the characteristic star\nformation rate surface density of the host galaxy, where $M_c \\propto$ $\\langle\n\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}} \\rangle^{\\sim1.1}$. We also find evidence that suggests\nthe observed $M_c$-$\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ relation also applies to globular\nclusters, linking the two populations via a common formation pathway. If so,\nglobular cluster mass functions could be useful tools for constraining the star\nformation properties of their progenitor host galaxies in the early Universe.\n", "  We study the intermediate inflation scenario in the context of $F(T)$\ngravity, and we examine it's viability by calculating the power spectrum of the\nprimordial curvature perturbations and the corresponding spectral index. As we\ndemonstrate, it is possible for the resulting spectral index to be compatible\nwith the observational data and we investigate the parameter space in order to\nsee when the compatibility with data is possible.\n", "  We consider a dynamical shake-up model to explain the low mass of Mars and\nthe lack of planets in the asteroid belt. In our scenario, a secular resonance\nwith Jupiter sweeps through the inner solar system as the solar nebula\ndepletes, pitting resonant excitation against collisional damping in the Sun's\nprotoplanetary disk. We report the outcome of extensive numerical calculations\nof planet formation from planetesimals in the terrestrial zone, with and\nwithout dynamical shake-up. If the Sun's gas disk within the terrestrial zone\ndepletes in roughly a million years, then the sweeping resonance inhibits\nplanet formation in the asteroid belt and substantially limits the size of\nMars. This phenomenon likely occurs around other stars with long-period massive\nplanets, suggesting that asteroid belt analogs are common.\n", "  The most powerful sources among the blazar family are MeV blazars. Often\ndetected at $z>2$, they usually display high X- and \\gm-ray luminosities,\nlarger-than-average jet powers and black hole masses $\\gtrsim 10^9 M_{\\odot}$.\nIn the present work we perform a multiwavelength study of three high redshift\nblazars: 3FGL J0325.5+2223 ($z=2.06$), 3FGL J0449.0+1121 ($z= 2.15$), and 3FGL\nJ0453.2$-$2808 ($z=2.56$), analysing quasi simultaneous data from GROND,\n\\swift-UVOT and XRT, \\nustar, and \\fermi-LAT. Our main focus is on the hard\nX-ray band recently unveiled by \\nustar~(3$-$79 keV) where these objects show a\nhard spectrum which enables us to constrain the inverse Compton peak and the\njet power. We found that all three targets resemble the most powerful blazars,\nwith the synchrotron peak located in the sub-millimeter range and the inverse\nCompton peak in the MeV range, and therefore belong to the MeV blazar class.\nUsing a simple one zone leptonic emission model to reproduce the spectral\nenergy distributions, we conclude that a simple combination of synchrotron and\naccretion disk emission reproduces the infrared-optical spectra while the X-ray\nto \\gm-ray part is well reproduced by the inverse Compton scattering of low\nenergy photons supplied by the broad line region. The black hole masses for\neach of the three sources are calculated to be $\\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{8}\nM_{\\odot}$. The three studied sources have jet power at the level of, or\nbeyond, the accretion luminosity.\n", "  The pasta phases are calculated for warm stellar matter in a framework of\nrelativistic mean-field models, including the possibility of light cluster\nformation. Results from three different semiclassical approaches are compared\nwith a quantum statistical calculation. Light clusters are considered as\npoint-like particles, and their abundances are determined from the minimization\nof the free energy. The couplings of the light-clusters to mesons are\ndetermined from experimental chemical equilibrium constants and many-body\nquantum statistical calculations. The effect of these light clusters on the\nchemical potentials is also discussed. It is shown that including heavy\nclusters, light clusters are present until larger nucleonic densities, although\nwith smaller mass fractions.\n", "  A significant number of double stars with separations up to 2.5 arcsec are\npresent in the Gaia Data Release 1 astrometric catalogs. Limiting our analysis\nto a well-studied sample of 1124 doubles resolved by Hipparcos, provided with\nindividual Tycho component photometry, and cross-matched with the TGAS catalog,\nwe estimate a rate of at least 3% for brighter double stars in Gaia DR1, which\nshould be resolved in the future data releases. Gaia astrometric results are\naffected by unresolved duplicity. The variance-normalized quadratic differences\nof proper motion between Gaia and Hipparcos do not follow the expected chi^2\ndistribution and show signs of powerful degradation in the components aligned\nwith the axes of the double systems. This concerns only pairs with separation\nbelow 1.2 -- 1.5 arcsec, which mostly remain unresolved in Gaia DR1. On the\nother hand, the orthogonal proper motion components and parallaxes do not have\nany detectable perturbation, as well as all astrometry for separations above\n1.5 arcsec. Gaia parallaxes do not seem to be perturbed by duplicity, with Gaia\n- Hipparcos differences being systematically smaller than the expectation. The\nrate of incorrectly identified, or swapped, companions is estimated at 0.4%.\n", "  The Vlasov equation is used to determine the dispersion relation for the\neigenmodes of magnetized nuclear and neutral stellar matter, taking into\naccount the anomalous magnetic moment of nucleons. The formalism is applied to\nthe determination of the dynamical spinodal section, a quantity that gives a\ngood estimation of the crust-core transition in neutron stars. We study the\neffect of strong magnetic fields, of the order of $10^{15}-10^{17}$ G, on the\nextension of the crust of magnetized neutron stars. The dynamical instability\nregion of neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter at subsaturation densities is\ndetermined within a relativistic mean field model. It is shown that a strong\nmagnetic field has a large effect on the instability region, defining the\ncrust-core transition as a succession of stable and unstable regions due to the\nopening of new Landau levels. The effect of the anomalous magnetic moment is\nnon-negligible for fields larger than 10$^{15}$ G. The complexity of the crust\nat the transition to the core and the increase of the crust thickness may have\ndirect impact on the properties of neutrons stars related with the crust.\n", "  Time-distance helioseismology is one of the primary tools for studying the\nsolar meridional circulation. However, travel-time measurements of the\nsubsurface meridional flow suffer from a variety of systematic errors, such as\na center-to-limb variation and an offset due to the P-angle uncertainty of\nsolar images. Here we apply the time-distance technique to contemporaneous\nmedium-degree Dopplergrams produced by SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI to obtain the\ntravel-time difference caused by meridional circulation throughout the solar\nconvection zone. The P-angle offset in MDI images is measured by\ncross-correlating MDI and HMI images. The travel-time measurements in the\nsouth-north and east-west directions are averaged over the same observation\nperiod for the two data sets and then compared to examine the consistency of\nMDI and HMI travel times after correcting the systematic errors.\n  The offsets in the south-north travel-time difference from MDI data induced\nby the P-angle error gradually diminish with increasing travel distance.\nHowever, these offsets become noisy for travel distances corresponding to waves\nthat reach the base of the convection zone. This suggests that a careful\ntreatment of the P-angle problem is required when studying a deep meridional\nflow. After correcting the P-angle and the removal of the center-to-limb\neffect, the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI are consistent within the\nerror bars for meridional circulation covering the entire convection zone. The\nfluctuations observed in both data sets are highly correlated and thus indicate\ntheir solar origin rather than an instrumental origin. Although our results\ndemonstrate that the ad hoc correction is capable of reducing the wide\ndiscrepancy in the travel-time measurements from MDI and HMI, we cannot exclude\nthe possibility that there exist other systematic effects acting on the two\ndata sets in the same way.\n", "  We present broadband parametric amplifiers based on the kinetic inductance of\nsuperconducting NbTiN thin films in an artificial (lumped-element) transmission\nline architecture. We demonstrate two amplifier designs implementing different\nphase matching techniques: periodic impedance loadings, and resonator phase\nshifters placed periodically along the transmission line. Our design offers\nseveral advantages over previous CPW-based amplifiers, including intrinsic 50\nohm characteristic impedance, natural suppression of higher pump harmonics,\nlower required pump power, and shorter total trace length. Experimental\nrealizations of both versions of the amplifiers are demonstrated. With a\ntransmission line length of 20 cm, we have achieved gains of 15 dB over several\nGHz of bandwidth.\n", "  The CLAS Collaboration recently reported measured ratios of pion and kaon\nelectroproduction cross sections from a proton target and extracted the ratios\nfor light and strange quark--antiquark pairs, ${u\\bar{u}}/ {d\\bar{d}}$ and\n${s\\bar{s}}/ {d\\bar{d}}$. Within an extended chiral constituent quark\nformalism, we investigate contributions to those ratios from the\nnonperturbative mechanism due to all possible intrinsic $|uudQ \\bar{Q}\\rangle$\nFock states in the proton; with $Q \\bar{Q} \\equiv u\\bar{u},~\nd\\bar{d},~s\\bar{s},~c\\bar{c}$. Our results are compared with the CLAS data and\nfindings from other phenomenological approaches, offering insights into the\nmanifestations of the genuine five--quark Fock states in the proton and its\nrelevance to interpreting the experimental data.\n", "  A continuum model for calculating the time-dependent hydrogen pickup\nfractions in various Zirconium alloys under steam and pressured water oxidation\nhas been developed in this study. Using only one fitting parameter, the\neffective hydrogen gas partial pressure at the oxide surface, a qualitative\nagreement is obtained between the predicted and previously measured hydrogen\npickup fractions. The calculation results therefore demonstrate that H\ndiffusion through the dense oxide layer plays an important role in the hydrogen\npickup process. The limitations and possible improvement of the model are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Noncentral collision of heavy ions can generate large magnetic field in its\nneighbourhood. We describe a method to calculate the effect of this field on\nthe dilepton emission rate from the colliding region, when it reaches thermal\nequilibrium. It is calculated in the real time method of thermal field theory.\nWe find that the rate is affected significantly only for lower momenta of\ndileptons.\n", "  We used data from the HST UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters to\nselect the Blue Straggler Star (BSS) population in four intermediate/high\ndensity systems (namely NGC 2808, NGC 6388, NGC 6541 and NGC 7078) through a\n\"UV-guided search\". This procedure consists in using the F275W images in each\ncluster to construct the master list of detected sources, and then force it to\nthe images acquired in the other filters. Such an approach optimizes the\ndetection of relatively hot stars and allows the detection of complete sample\nof BSSs even in the central region of high-density clusters, because the light\nfrom the bright cool giants, which dominates the optical emission in old\nstellar systems, is sensibly reduced at UV wavelengths. Our UV-guided\nselections of BSSs have been compared to the samples obtained in previous,\noptical-driven surveys, clearly demonstrating the efficiency of the UV\napproach. In each cluster we also measured the parameter A+, defined as the\narea enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a\nreference population, which traces the level of BSS central segregation and the\nlevel of dynamical evolution suffered by the system. The values measured for\nthe four clusters studied in this paper nicely fall along the dynamical\nsequence recently presented for a sample of 25 clusters.\n", "  The magnetic properties attributed to the hydroxide layer of\nLi1-xFex(OH)Fe1-ySe have been elucidated by the study of superconducting and\nnonsuperconducting members of this family. Both ac magnetometry and muon spin\nrelaxation measurements of nonsuperconductors find a magnetic state existing\nbelow approximately 10 K which exhibits slow relaxation of magnetization. This\nmagnetic state is accompanied by a low-temperature heat capacity anomaly\npresent in both superconducting and nonsuperconducting variants suggesting that\nthe magnetism persists into the superconducting state. The estimated value of\nmagnetic moment present within the hydroxide layer supports a picture of a\nglassy magnetic state, probably comprising clusters of iron ions of varying\ncluster sizes distributed within the lithium hydroxide layer.\n", "  In this paper we use the the topological vertex formalism to calculate a\ngeneralization of the \"domain wall\" partition function of M-strings. This\ngeneralization allows calculation of partition function of certain compactified\nwebs using a simple gluing algorithm similar to M-strings case.\n", "  We investigate the transient photoexcited lattice dynamics in a layered\nperovskite Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 by femtosecond X-ray diffraction using a\nlaser plasma-based X-ray source. Ultrafast structural dynamics of Sr2IrO4 thin\nfilms are determined by observing the shift and broadening of the (0012) Bragg\ndiffraction after excitation by 1.5 eV and 3.0 eV pump photons for films with\ndifferent thicknesses. The observed transient lattice response can be well\ninterpreted as a distinct three-step dynamics due to the propagation of\ncoherent acoustic phonons generated by the photoinduced quasiparticles (QP).\nEmploying a normalized phonon propagation model, we found that the photoinduced\nangular shifts of the Bragg peak collapse into a universal curve after\nintroducing a normalized coordinates to account for different thicknesses and\npump photon energies, pinpointing the origin of the lattice distortion and its\nearly evolution. In addition, a transient photocurrent measurement indicates\nthat the photoinduced QPs are charge neutral excitons. Mapping the phonon\npropagation and correlating its dynamics with the QP by ultrafast X-ray\ndiffraction (UXRD) establish a powerful way to study electron-phonon coupling\nand uncover the exotic physics in strongly correlated systems under\nnonequilibrium conditions.\n", "  We show that a positive linear map preserves local continuity (convergence)\nof the entropy if and only if it preserves finiteness of the entropy, i.e.\ntransforms operators with finite entropy to operators with finite entropy. The\nlast property is equivalent to the boundedness of the output entropy of a map\non the set of pure states.\n  This criterion is used for analysis of tensor products of quantum channels\npreserving continuity of the entropy.\n  Some applications to the entanglement theory are considered.\n", "  We present ~0.4 resolution images of CO(3-2) and associated continuum\nemission from the gas-bearing debris disk around the nearby A star 49 Ceti,\nobserved with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We\nanalyze the ALMA visibilities in tandem with the broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution to measure the radial surface density profiles of dust and gas\nemission from the system. The dust surface density decreases with radius\nbetween ~100 and 310 au, with a marginally significant enhancement of surface\ndensity at a radius of ~110 au. The SED requires an inner disk of small grains\nin addition to the outer disk of larger grains resolved by ALMA. The gas disk\nexhibits a surface density profile that increases with radius, contrary to most\nprevious spatially resolved observations of circumstellar gas disks. While ~80%\nof the CO flux is well described by an axisymmetric power-law disk in Keplerian\nrotation about the central star, residuals at ~20% of the peak flux exhibit a\ndeparture from axisymmetry suggestive of spiral arms or a warp in the gas disk.\nThe radial extent of the gas disk (~220 au) is smaller than that of the dust\ndisk (~300 au), consistent with recent observations of other gas-bearing debris\ndisks. While there are so far only three broad debris disks with well\ncharacterized radial dust profiles at millimeter wavelengths, 49 Ceti's disk\nshows a markedly different structure from two radially resolved gas-poor debris\ndisks, implying that the physical processes generating and sculpting the gas\nand dust are fundamentally different.\n", "  Newly born massive magnetars are generally considered to be produced by\nbinary neutron star (NS) mergers, which could give rise to short gamma-ray\nbursts (SGRBs). The strong magnetic fields and fast rotation of these magnetars\nmake them promising sources for gravitational wave (GW) detection using ground\nbased GW interferometers. Based on the observed masses of Galactic NS-NS\nbinaries, by assuming different equations of state (EOSs) of dense matter, we\ninvestigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by an\nensemble of newly born massive magnetars. The massive magnetar formation rate\nis estimated through: (i) the SGRB formation rate (hereafter entitled as MFR1);\n(ii) the NS-NS merger rate (hereafter entitled as MFR2). We find that for\nmassive magnetars with masses $M_{\\rm mg}=2.4743 M_\\odot$, if EOS CDDM2 is\nassumed, the resultant SGWBs may be detected by the future Einstein Telescope\n(ET) even for MFR1 with minimal local formation rate, and for MFR2 with a local\nmerger rate $\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm c}^{\\rm o}(0)\\lesssim 10$ ${\\rm Mpc}^{-3}{\\rm\nMyr}^{-1}$. However, if EOS BSk21 is assumed, the SGWB may be detectable by the\nET for MFR1 with the maximal local formation rate. Moreover, the background\nspectra show cutoffs at about 350 Hz in the case of EOS BSk21, and at 124 Hz\nfor CDDM2, respectively. We suggest that if the cutoff at $\\sim100$ Hz in the\nbackground spectrum from massive magnetars could be detected, then the quark\nstar EOS CDDM2 seems to be favorable. Moreover, the EOSs, which present\nrelatively small TOV maximum masses, would be excluded.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically study x-ray multiphoton ionization dynamics\nof heavy atoms taking into account relativistic and resonance effects. When an\natom is exposed to an intense x-ray pulse generated by an x-ray free-electron\nlaser (XFEL), it is ionized to a highly charged ion via a sequence of\nsingle-photon ionization and accompanying relaxation processes, and its final\ncharge state is limited by the last ionic state that can be ionized by a\nsingle-photon ionization. If x-ray multiphoton ionization involves deep\ninner-shell electrons in heavy atoms, energy shifts by relativistic effects\nplay an important role in ionization dynamics, as pointed out in [Phys.\\ Rev.\\\nLett.\\ \\textbf{110}, 173005 (2013)]. On the other hand, if the x-ray beam has a\nbroad energy bandwidth, the high-intensity x-ray pulse can drive resonant\nphoto-excitations for a broad range of ionic states and ionize even beyond the\ndirect one-photon ionization limit, as first proposed in [Nature\\ Photon.\\\n\\textbf{6}, 858 (2012)]. To investigate both relativistic and resonance\neffects, we extend the \\textsc{xatom} toolkit to incorporate relativistic\nenergy corrections and resonant excitations in x-ray multiphoton ionization\ndynamics calculations. Charge-state distributions are calculated for Xe atoms\ninteracting with intense XFEL pulses at a photon energy of 1.5~keV and 5.5~keV,\nrespectively. For both photon energies, we demonstrate that the role of\nresonant excitations in ionization dynamics is altered due to significant\nshifts of orbital energy levels by relativistic effects. Therefore it is\nnecessary to take into account both effects to accurately simulate multiphoton\nmultiple ionization dynamics at high x-ray intensity.\n", "  We construct a scalar polynomial curvature invariant that transforms\ncovariantly under a conformal transformation from any spherically symmetric\nmetric. This invariant has the additional property that it vanishes on the\nevent horizon of any black hole that is conformal to a static spherical metric.\n", "  We present a study of the kinematics of the extraplanar ionized gas around\nseveral dozen galaxies observed by the Mapping of Nearby Galaxies at the Apache\nPoint Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We considered a sample of 67 edge-on galaxies\nout of more than 1400 extragalactic targets observed by MaNGA, in which we\nfound 25 galaxies (or 37%) with regular lagging of the rotation curve at large\ndistances from the galactic midplane. We model the observed $H\\alpha$ emission\nvelocity fields in the galaxies, taking projection effects and a simple model\nfor the dust extinction into the account. We show that the vertical lag of the\nrotation curve is necessary in the modeling, and estimate the lag amplitude in\nthe galaxies. We find no correlation between the lag and the star formation\nrate in the galaxies. At the same time, we report a correlation between the lag\nand the galactic stellar mass, central stellar velocity dispersion, and axial\nratio of the light distribution. These correlations suggest a possible higher\nratio of infalling-to-local gas in early-type disk galaxies or a connection\nbetween lags and the possible presence of hot gaseous halos, which may be more\nprevalent in more massive galaxies. These results again demonstrate that\nobservations of extraplanar gas can serve as a potential probe for accretion of\ngas.\n", "  We prove the non existence of massive scalar, vector and tensor hairs outside\nthe surface of a static and stationary compact reflecting star. Our result is\nthe extension of the no hair theorem for black holes to horizonless compact\nconfigurations with reflecting boundary condition at the surface. We also\ngeneralize the proof for spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant.\n", "  We consider quantum circuits with time travel designed for distinguishing\nspecific nonorthogonal quantum states in two most popular models: Deutschs and\npostselected. We modify them by a presence of weakly coupled thermal\nenvironment. Using the Davies approximation we study how the thermal noise\naffects an ability of the circuits to distinguish nonorthogonal quantum states.\nWe show that for purely dephasing environment a paradoxial power of such\ncircuits remains preserved. We also present a physics based argument for\nconditions of validity of the maximum entropy rule introduced by David Deutsch\nfor resolving the uniqueness ambiguity in a circuit with time travel.\n", "  The origin of fluorine is a widely debated issue. Nevertheless, the\n^{15}N({\\alpha},{\\gamma})^{19}F reaction is a common feature among the various\nproduction channels so far proposed. Its reaction rate at relevant temperatures\nis determined by a number of narrow resonances together with the DC component\nand the tails of the two broad resonances at E_{c.m.} = 1323 and 1487 keV.\nMeasurement through the direct detection of the 19F recoil ions with the\nEuropean Recoil separator for Nuclear Astrophysics (ERNA) were performed. The\nreaction was initiated by a 15N beam impinging onto a 4He windowless gas\ntarget. The observed yield of the resonances at Ec.m. = 1323 and 1487 keV is\nused to determine their widths in the {\\alpha} and {\\gamma} channels. We show\nthat a direct measurement of the cross section of the\n^{15}N({\\alpha},{\\gamma})^{19}F reaction can be successfully obtained with the\nRecoil Separator ERNA, and the widths {\\Gamma}_{\\gamma} and {\\Gamma}_{\\alpha}\nof the two broad resonances have been determined. While a fair agreement is\nfound with earlier determination of the widths of the 1487 keV resonance, a\nsignificant difference is found for the 1323 keV resonance {\\Gamma}_{\\alpha} .\nThe revision of the widths of the two more relevant broad resonances in the\n15N({\\alpha},{\\gamma})19F reaction presented in this work is the first step\ntoward a more firm determination of the reaction rate. At present, the residual\nuncertainty at the temperatures of the ^{19}F stellar nucleosynthesis is\ndominated by the uncertainties affecting the Direct Capture component and the\n364 keV narrow resonance, both so far investigated only through indirect\nexperiments.\n", "  Pure spin current is a powerful tool for manipulating spintronic devices, and\nits dynamical behavior is an important issue. By using mesoscopic transport\ntheory for electron tunneling induced by spin accumulation, we investigate the\ndynamics of the spin current in the high-frequency quantum regime, where the\nfrequency is much larger than temperature and bias voltage. Besides the thermal\nnoise, frequency-dependent finite noise emerges, signaling the spin current\nacross the tunneling barrier. We also find that the autocorrelation of the spin\ncurrent exhibits sinusoidal oscillation in time as a consequence of the Pauli\nexclusion principle even without any net charge current.\n", "  In a standard bifurcation of a dynamical system, the stationary points (or\nmore generally attractors) change qualitatively when varying a control\nparameter. Here we describe a novel unusual effect, when the change of a\nparameter, e.g. a growth rate, does not influence the stationary states, but\nnevertheless leads to a qualitative change of dynamics. For instance, such a\ndynamic transition can be between the convergence to a stationary state and a\nstrong increase without stationary states, or between the convergence to one\nstationary state and that to a different state. This effect is illustrated for\na dynamical system describing two symbiotic populations, one of which exhibits\na growth rate larger than the other one. We show that, although the stationary\nstates of the dynamical system do not depend on the growth rates, the latter\ninfluence the boundary of the basins of attraction. This change of the basins\nof attraction explains this unusual effect of the quantitative change of\ndynamics by growth rate variation.\n", "  We investigate ringed accretion disks constituted by two tori (rings)\norbiting on the equatorial plane of a central super-massive Kerr black hole. We\ndiscuss the emergence of the instability phases of each ring of the\nmacro-configuration (ringed disk) according to Paczynski violation of\nmechanical equilibrium. In the full general relativistic treatment, we consider\nthe effects of the geometry of the Kerr spacetimes relevant in the\ncharacterization of the evolution of these configurations. The discussion of\nthe rings stability in different spacetimes enables us to identify particular\nclasses of central Kerr attractors in dependence of their dimensionless spin.\nAs a result of this analysis we set constraints of the evolutionary schemes of\nthe ringed disks related to the tori morphology and their rotation relative to\nthe central black hole and to each other. The dynamics of the unstable phases\nof this system is significant for the high energy phenomena related to\naccretion onto super-massive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and\nthe extremely energetic phenomena in quasars which could be observable in their\nX-ray emission.\n", "  The STAR experiment at RHIC is planning to upgrade the Time Projection\nChamber which lies at the heart of the detector. We have designed an instrument\nto measure the tension of the wires in the multi-wire proportional chambers\n(MWPCs) which will be used in the TPC upgrade. The wire tension measurement\nsystem causes the wires to vibrate and then it measures the fundamental\nfrequency of the oscillation via a laser based optical platform. The platform\ncan scan the entire wire plane, automatically, in a single run and obtain the\nwire tension on each wire with high precision. In this paper, the details about\nthe measurement method and the system setup will be described. In addition, the\ntest results for a prototype MWPC to be used in the STAR-iTPC upgrade will be\npresented.\n", "  We discuss on different issues pertaining the theory of gravity, which pose\nsome unresolved fundamental questions. First we tackle the problem of observers\nin general relativity, with particular emphasis in tilted observers. We explain\nwhy these observers may detect dissipative processes in systems which appear\nisentropic to comoving observers. Next we analyze the strange relationship\nbetween vorticity and radiation, and underline the potential observational\nconsequences of such a link. Finally we summarize all the results that have\nbeen obtained so far on the physical properties of the sources of gravitational\nradiation. We conclude with a list of open questions which we believe deserve\nfurther attention.\n", "  A pedagogical introduction to matrix Green's function, focusing on its\napplication to steady state transport through discrete-level quantum systems.\nTopics covered in the notes: 1.

Yet its distribution and dominant formation pathway(s) remain largely\nunconstrained. To address these issues, we present ALMA observations of two\nH2CO lines (3_{12}-2_{11} and 5_{15}-4_{14}) at 0\".5 (~30 au) spatial\nresolution toward the disk around the nearby T Tauri star TW Hya. Emission from\nboth lines is spatially resolved, showing a central depression, a peak at 0\".4\nradius, and a radial decline at larger radii with a bump at ~1\", near the\nmillimeter continuum edge. We adopt a physical model for the disk and use toy\nmodels to explore the radial and vertical H2CO abundance structure. We find\nthat the observed emission implies the presence of at least two distinct H2CO\ngas reservoirs: (1) a warm and unresolved inner component (<10 au), and (2) an\nouter component that extends from ~15 au to beyond the millimeter continuum\nedge. The outer component is further constrained by the line ratio to arise in\na more elevated disk layer at larger radii. The inferred H2CO abundance\nstructure agrees well with disk chemistry models, which predict efficient H2CO\ngas-phase formation close to the star, and cold H2CO grain surface formation,\nthrough H additions to condensed CO, followed by non-thermal desorption in the\nouter disk. The implied presence of active grain surface chemistry in the TW\nHya disk is consistent with the recent detection of CH3OH emission, and\nsuggests that more complex organic molecules are formed in disks, as well.\n", "  Understanding the properties of drip line nuclei requires to take into\naccount the correlations with the continuum spectrum of energy of the system.\nThis paper has the purpose to show that the continuum single particle level\ndensity is a convenient way to consider the pairing correlation in the\ncontinuum. Isospin mean-field and isospin pairing strength are used to find the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Lipkin-Nogami (LN) approximate solutions of\nthe pairing Hamiltonian. Several physical properties of the whole chain of the\nTin isotope, as gap parameter, Fermi level, binding energy, and one- and\ntwo-neutron separation energies, were calculated and compared with other\nmethods and with experimental data when they exist. It is shown that the use of\nthe continuum single particle level density is an economical way to include\nexplicitly the correlations with the continuum spectrum of energy in large\nscale mass calculation. It is also shown that the computed properties are in\ngood agreement with experimental data and with more sophisticated treatment of\nthe pairing interaction.\n", "  POLAR is space-borne detector designed for a precise measurement of gamma-ray\npolarization of the prompt emissions of Gamma-Ray Bursts in the energy range 50\nkeV - 500 keV. POLAR is a compact Compton polarimeter consisting of 40$\\times$\n40 plastic scintillator bars read out by 25 multi-anode PMTs. In May 2015, we\nperformed a series of tests of the POLAR flight model with 100\\% polarized\nx-rays beams at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beam-line ID11\naming to study thresholds, crosstalk between channels and responses of POLAR\nflight model to polarized X-ray beams. In this paper we present the data\nanalysis method and some analysis results. According the results, POLAR FM has\ngood polarimetric capabilities.\n", "  In the context of the relationship between physics of cosmological dark\nmatter and symmetry of elementary particles a wide list of dark matter\ncandidates is possible. New symmetries provide stability of different new\nparticles and their combination can lead to a multicomponent dark matter. The\npattern of symmetry breaking involves phase transitions in very early Universe,\nextending the list of candidates by topological defects and even primordial\nnonlinear structures.\n", "  Unlike the standard model where neutrino masses can be made arbitrarily\nsmall, we find in the minimal left-right symmetric model that Dirac type Yukawa\ncoupling $h_D \\sim 10^{-4.2}$ for $\\nu_\\tau$ is generated from charged fermion\nYukawa couplings through one loop Renormalization Group (RG) running. Using the\nseesaw relation this implies that the natural scale for right-handed neutrino's\nMajorana mass (seesaw scale) $M_N = f v_R \\gtrsim 2000 TeV$. If we take the\n$SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale $v_R$ to be below 50 TeV, so that it\ncan be probed by LHC and a future collider, then the large $h_D$ generated on\nRG running increases the mass $m_\\nu$ of the third generation light neutrino\nand severely suppresses the PMNS mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$. We discuss the\ntuning needed for seesaw scales that can be probed by colliders and find the\nparameter space that can be tested by neutrino experiments for higher scales up\nto $10^{15} GeV$.\n", "  Annealing treatment is an important step of rolling deformation that\ncontributes to microstructural evolution and leads to the significant changes\nin damping capacity. Damping capacities were analyzed in the parallel to\nrolling direction at 1 and 10 Hz respectively. It was found that severe plastic\ndeformation at 40 percent reduction has lower damping capacity compared to that\nof 30 percent and 20 percent reductions respectively. The microstructural\nresults show that the grains of as rolled alloys were changed to almost\nequiaxed structures after a rolling reduction at 40 percent reduction.\n", "  Handedness of the director twist in cholesteric liquid crystals is commonly\nassumed to be the same throughout the medium, determined solely by the\nchirality of constituent molecules or chiral additives, albeit distortions of\nthe ground-state helicoidal configuration often arise due to the effects of\nconfinement and external fields. We directly probe the twist directionality of\nliquid crystal director structures through experimental three-dimensional\nimaging and numerical minimization of the elastic free energy and show that\nspatially localized regions of handedness opposite to that of the chiral liquid\ncrystal ground state can arise in the proximity of twisted-soliton-bound\ntopological point defects. In chiral nematic liquid crystal confined to a film\nthat has a thickness less than the cholesteric pitch and perpendicular surface\nboundary conditions, twisted solitonic structures embedded in a uniform unwound\nfar-field background with chirality-matched handedness locally relieve\nconfinement-imposed frustration and tend to be accompanied by point defects and\nsmaller geometry-required energetically costly regions of opposite twist\nhandedness. We also describe a new spatially localized structure, dubbed a\n\"twistion\", in which a twisted solitonic three-dimensional director\nconfiguration is accompanied by four point defects. We discuss how our findings\nmay impinge on the stability of localized particle-like director field\nconfigurations in chiral and non-chiral liquid crystals.\n", "  We study plasmon-exciton interaction by using topological singularities to\nspatially confine, selectively deliver, cotrap and optically probe colloidal\nsemiconductor and plasmonic nanoparticles. The interaction is monitored in a\nsingle quantum system in the bulk of a liquid crystal medium where\nnanoparticles are manipulated and nanoconfined far from dielectric interfaces\nusing laser tweezers and topological configurations are spatially colocated\nwith a plasmonic gold nanoburst particle in a topological singularity core, its\nfluorescence increases because blinking is significantly suppressed and the\nradiative decay rate increases by nearly an order of magnitude owing to the\nPurcell effect. We argue that the blinking suppression is the result of the\nradiative rate change that mitigates Auger recombination and quantum dot\nionization, consequently reducing nonradiative recombination. Our work\ndemonstrates that topological singularities are an effective platform for\nstudying and controlling plasmon-exciton interactions.\n", "  We study the changes in quantum Fisher information (QFI) values for one\nquantum system consisting of a superposition of W and GHZ states. In a recent\nwork [6], QFI values of this mentioned system studied. In this work, we extend\nthis problem for the changes of QFI values in some noisy channels. We show the\nchange in QFI depending on noise parameters. We report interesting results for\ndifferent type of decoherence channels.\n", "  Recently demonstrated metal-semiconductor heterojunctions with few-atom\nthickness show their promise as 2D Schottky contacts for future integrated\ncircuits and nanoelectronics. The theory for 3D Schottky contacts, however,\nfails on these low-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a new model that\nyields carrier distribution and potential profile across the 2D\nmetal-semiconductor heterojunction under the equilibrium condition, based on\nthe input from first-principle calculations. Our calculation also suggests\nthat, at the same forward bias, the current density of a stack of 2D\ngraphene-phosphorene Schottky diodes may be ten thousand times higher than that\nof a traditional 3D Schottky diode and offer less energy dissipation.\n", "  The angle of rotation of any target about the radar line of sight (LOS) is\nknown as the polarization orientation angle. The orientation angle is found to\nbe non-zero for undulating terrains and man-made targets oriented away from the\nradar LOS. This effect is more pronounced at lower frequencies (eg. L- and P-\nbands). The orientation angle shift is not only induced by azimuthal slope but\nalso by range slope. This shift increases the cross-polarization (HV) intensity\nand subsequently, the covariance or the coherency matrix becomes reflection\nasymmetric. Compensating this orientation angle prior to any model-based\ndecomposition technique for geophysical parameter estimation or classification\nis crucial. In this paper, a new method is proposed to estimate the orientation\nangle based on the maximization of the degree of polarization. The proposed\nmethod is then used to infer the change in the degree of polarization with the\nassociated orientation angle.\n", "  The notions of entanglement and nonlocality are among the most striking\ningredients found in quantum information theory. One tool to better understand\nthese notions is the model of nonlocal games; a mathematical framework that\nabstractly models a physical system. The simplest instance of a nonlocal game\ninvolves two players, Alice and Bob, who are not allowed to communicate with\neach other once the game has started and who play cooperatively against an\nadversary referred to as the referee. The focus of this thesis is a class of\ngames called extended nonlocal games, of which nonlocal games are a subset. In\nan extended nonlocal game, the players initially share a tripartite state with\nthe referee. In such games, the winning conditions for Alice and Bob may depend\non outcomes of measurements made by the referee, on its part of the shared\nquantum state, in addition to Alice and Bob's answers to the questions sent by\nthe referee. We build up the framework for extended nonlocal games and study\ntheir properties and how they relate to nonlocal games.\n", "  Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of\nwell-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We\nuncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore\nCd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$ using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy\nmeasurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this\nmultipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving\ntranslational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being\nodd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar\nnematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition\nnear 200 kelvin in Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$ and induces a parity-breaking lattice\ndistortion as a secondary order.\n", "  Effects of subgrid-scale gravity waves (GWs) on the diurnal migrating tides\nare investigated from the mesosphere to the upper thermosphere for September\nequinox conditions, using a general circulation model coupled with the extended\nspectral nonlinear GW parameterization of Yi\\u{g}it et al (2008). Simulations\nwith GW effects cut-off above the turbopause and included in the entire\nthermosphere have been conducted. GWs appreciably impact the mean circulation\nand cool the thermosphere down by up to 12-18%. GWs significantly affect the\nwinds modulated by the diurnal migrating tide, in particular in the\nlow-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere and in the high-latitude\nthermosphere. These effects depend on the mutual correlation of the diurnal\nphases of the GW forcing and tides: GWs can either enhance or reduce the tidal\namplitude. In the low-latitude MLT, the correlation between the direction of\nthe deposited GW momentum and the tidal phase is positive due to propagation of\na broad spectrum of GW harmonics through the alternating winds. In the Northern\nHemisphere high-latitude thermosphere, GWs act against the tide due to an\nanti-correlation of tidal wind and GW momentum, while in the Southern\nhigh-latitudes they weakly enhance the tidal amplitude via a combination of a\npartial correlation of phases and GW-induced changes of the circulation. The\nvariable nature of GW effects on the thermal tide can be captured in GCMs\nprovided that a GW parameterization (1) considers a broad spectrum of\nharmonics, (2) properly describes their propagation, and (3) correctly accounts\nfor the physics of wave breaking/saturation.\n", "  In this paper, a four dimensional rotating Kaluza Klien (K-K) black hole was\ndeformed using rainbow functions derived from loop quantum gravity and\nnon-commutative geometry. We studied the thermodynamic properties and critical\nphenomena of this deformed black hole. The deformed temperature and entropy\nshowed the existence of a Planckian remnant. The calculation of Gibbs free\nenergy $ G$ for the ordinary and deformed black holes showed that both share a\nsimilar critical behaviour.\n", "  A Bayesian data assimilation scheme is formulated for advection-dominated or\nhyperbolic evolutionary problems, and observations. The method is referred to\nas the dynamic likelihood filter because it exploits the model physics to\ndynamically update the likelihood with the aim of making better use of low\nuncertainty sparse observations.\n  The filter is applied to a problem with linear dynamics and Gaussian\nstatistics, and compared to the exact estimate, a model outcome, and the Kalman\nfilter estimate. Its estimates are shown to be superior to the model outcomes\nand the Kalman estimate, when the observation system is sparse. The added\ncomputational expense of the method is linear in the number of observations and\nthus computationally efficient, suggesting that the method is practical even if\nthe space dimensions of the physical problem are large.\n", "  We address previous hypotheses about possible factors influencing the gender\ngap in attainment in physics. Specifically, previous studies claim that male\nadvantage may arise from multiple-choice style questions, and that scaffolding\nmay preferentially benefit female students. We claim that female students are\nnot disadvantaged by multiple-choice style questions, and also present some\nalternative conclusions surrounding the scaffolding hypothesis. By taking both\nstudent attainment level and the degree of question scaffolding into account,\nwe identify questions which exhibit real bias in favour of male students. We\nfind that both multi-dimensional context and use of diagrams are common\nelements of such questions.\n", "  An analytical procedure, which couples electric, magnetic, thermal and\nmechanical effects is presented for the prediction of the response of\nunidirectional fiber-reinforced composites that are subjected to electric\nfield, applied in the fibers' direction. It is assumed that at least one of the\nphases of the composite (e.g., the fibers) is electrically conductive, and that\nall phases are thermally conductive. The composite is assumed to occupy a\nfinite, symmetric domain which is discretized into a double array of subcells.\nThe governing equations, with the interfacial and boundary conditions, are\nsatisfied in the integral sense. The externally applied field generates\nelectric current, which induces a magnetic field as well as temperature\nincrease. The mechanical deformation of the composite results from the combined\neffect of the ponderomotive force, which is created by the magnetic field, and\nthe temperature distribution within the constituents. The purpose of the\npresent paper is three-fold. (a) To perform quantitative analysis of the model\nfor the ponderoromotive force in deformable media. (b) To present computational\nstrong-form treatment of the magneto-mechanical boundary-value problem in a\ncomposite. (c) To suggest a computational apparatus for deriving the response\nof a sensor/actuator excited by an applied electric field or electric field\ngradient. Application is given, presenting the magnetic, thermal and mechanical\nfield distributions, as well as the macroscopic (global) response of a\ncomposite, which consists, for simplicity, of two iron fibers embedded in an\nepoxy matrix.\n", "  Investigating the overall brightness of planets (and moons) provides insight\ninto their envelopes and energy budgets [1, 2, 3, 4]. Titan phase curves (a\nrepresentation of overall brightness vs. Sun-object-observer phase angle) have\nbeen published over a limited range of phase angles and spectral passbands [5,\n6]. Such information has been key to the study of the stratification,\nmicrophysics and aggregate nature of Titan's atmospheric haze [7, 8], and has\ncomplemented the spatially-resolved observations first showing that the haze\nscatters efficiently in the forward direction [7, 9]. Here we present Cassini\nImaging Science Subsystem whole-disk brightness measurements of Titan from\nultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. The observations reveal that Titan's\ntwilight (loosely defined as the view when the phase angle 150deg) outshines\nits daylight at various wavelengths. From the match between measurements and\nmodels, we show that at even larger phase angles the back-illuminated moon will\nappear much brighter than when fully illuminated. This behavior is unique to\nTitan in our solar system, and is caused by its extended atmosphere and the\nefficient forward scattering of sunlight by its atmospheric haze. We infer a\nsolar energy deposition rate (for a solar constant of 14.9 Wm-2) of\n(2.84+/-0.11)x10^14 W, consistent to within 1-2 standard deviations with\nTitan's time-varying thermal emission spanning 2007- 2013 [10, 11]. We propose\nthat a forward scattering signature may also occur at large phase angles in the\nbrightness of exoplanets with extended hazy atmospheres, and that this\nsignature has valuable diagnostic potential for atmospheric characterization.\n", "  We have developed the first laser damage simulation algorithm capable of\ndetermining crater and surface modification morphology from microscopic\nphysics. Rapid progress in the field of high intensity ultrafast lasers has\nenabled its utility in a myriad of applications. Simulation plays an important\nrole in this research by allowing for closer analysis of the physical\nmechanisms involved, but current techniques struggle to meet both the spatial\nscope or resolution requirements for modeling such dynamics, typically\nspecializing in one or the other. Consequently, it is difficult to extract the\nphysical form of the laser induced surface modification, hampering direct\ncomparison of simulation to experimental results. Our algorithm offers a\ncompromise to existing simulation techniques and enables the production of a\ncomplete density profile in addition to the simulation of intermediate\ndynamics. We use this capability to directly test our simulation against\nexperimentally produced copper craters. Additionally, we show how our algorithm\ncan be used to model the formation of surface roughness and nanoparticles.\n", "  Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we studied bulk and\nsurface electronic band structures of narrow-gap semiconductor lead telluride\n(PbTe) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy both perpendicular and\nparallel to the {\\Gamma}-L direction. The comparison of ARPES data with the\nfirst-principles calculation reveals the details of band structures, orbital\ncharacters, spin-orbit splitting energies, and surface states. The\nphoton-energy-dependent spectra show the bulk character. Both the L and\n{\\Sigma} valence bands are observed and their energy difference is determined.\nThe spin-orbit splitting energies at L and {\\Gamma} points are 0.62 eV and 0.88\neV, respectively. The surface states below and close to the valence band\nmaximum are identified. The valence bands are composed of a mixture of Pb 6s\nand Te $5p_z$ orbitals with dominant in-plane even parity, which is attributed\nto the layered distortion in the vicinity of PbTe (111) surface. These findings\nprovide insights into PbTe fundamental properties and shall benefit relevant\nthermoelectric and optoelectronic applications.\n", "  The effects of the tilt of the crystallographic orientation with respect to\nan incident electron probe on high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging in\naberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) have been\ninvestigated with experiments and simulations. A small specimen tilt can lead\nto unequal deviations of different atom species in the HAADF image and result\nin further relative displacement between anions and cations. Simulated HAADF\nimages also confirm that the crystal tilt causes an artifact in atom\npolarization as well. The effect is derived from the scattering ability of\ndifferent atoms.\n", "  Monolayer Tellurium (Te) or tellurene has been suggested by a recent theory\nas a new two-dimensional (2D) system with great electronic and optoelectronic\npromises. Here we present an experimental study of epitaxial Te deposited on\nhighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by molecular-beam epitaxy.\nScanning tunneling microscopy of ultrathin layers of Te reveals rectangular\nsurface cells with the cell size consistent with the theoretically predicted\nbeta-tellurene, whereas for thicker films, the cell size is more consistent\nwith that of the (10-10) surface of bulk Te crystal. Scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy measurements show the films are semiconductors with the energy\nbandgaps decreasing with increasing film thickness, and the gap narrowing\noccurs predominantly at the valance-band maximum (VBM). The latter is\nunderstood by strong coupling of states at the VBM but a weak coupling at\nconduction band minimum (CBM) as revealed by density functional theory\ncalculations.\n", "  In this paper, a novel method of quantum image rotation (QIR) based on shear\ntransformations on NEQR quantum images is proposed. To compute the horizontal\nand vertical shear mappings required for rotation, we have designed quantum\nself-adder, quantum control multiplier, and quantum interpolation circuits as\nthe basic computing units in the QIR implementation. Furthermore, we provide\nseveral examples of our results by presenting computer simulation experiments\nof QIR under $30^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, and $60^\\circ$ rotation scenarios and have\na discussion onto the anti-aliasing and computational complexity of the\nproposed QIR method.\n", "  Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is an important\nclass of LB model with lots of advantages over traditional\nsingle-relaxation-time (SRT) LB model. In addition, the computation of strain\nrate tensor is crucial in MRT-LB simulations of some complex flows. Up to now,\nthere are only two formulas to compute the strain rate tensor in the MRT LB\nmodel. One is to compute the strain rate tensor by using non-equilibrium parts\nof macroscopic moments (Yu formula). The other is to compute the strain rate\ntensor by using non-equilibrium parts of density distribution functions (Chai\nformula). The mathematical expressions of these two formulas are so different\nthat we do not know which formula to choose for computing the strain rate\ntensor in MRT LB model. In this paper, we study the relationship of these two\nformulas. It is found that Yu formula can be deduced from Chai formula in a\nparticular procedure. However, these two formulas have their own advantages and\ndisadvantages. Yu formula is more efficient in the computation aspect while\nChai formula can be applied to more lattice patterns of MRT LB models. It is\nalso found that deducing Yu formula for a particular lattice pattern from Chai\nformula is more convenient than the way proposed by Yu et al.\n", "  In this paper we study an error correcting protocol that specifically derives\nits error correcting properties from elementary units of coherence. The entire\nprotocol from beginning to end is performed using non-coherence increasing\noperations, resulting in the consumption of the input coherence, thus\nnecessitating further quantum resources if one wishes to perform the protocol\nagain. We show that even when the input quantum resource is just 1 coherent\nqubit, one may acquire partial protection from phase flip errors, and that this\ncan be scaled up to protect against arbitrary qubit errors with 6 ancillary\ncoherent qubits as input. The work presented strengthens the operational\ninterpretation of a single unit of coherence by providing a useful information\ntheoretic task that one may perform when such elementary units of coherence are\navailable.\n", "  A newly discovered family of high-Tc Fe-based superconductors, AeAFe4As4 (Ae\n= Ca, Sr, Eu and A = K, Rb, Cs), offers further opportunities to understand\nunconventional superconductivity in these materials. In this Rapid\nCommunication, we report on the superconducting and magnetic properties of\nCaKFe4As4, studied using muon spectroscopy. Zero-field muon spin relaxation\nstudies carried out on the CaKFe4As4 superconductor do not show any detectable\nmagnetic anomaly at Tc or below, implying that time-reversal symmetry is\npreserved in the superconducting ground state. The temperature dependence of\nthe superfluid density of CaKFe4As4 is found to be compatible with a two-gap s\n+ s-wave model with gap values of 8.6(4) and 2.5(3) meV, similar to the other\nFe-based superconductors. The presence of two superconducting energy gaps is\nconsistent with theoretical and other experimental studies on this material.\nThe value of the penetration depth at T = 0 K has been determined as 289(22)\nnm.\n", "  Scanning superconducting quantum interference device measurements reveal\nlarge-scale modulations of the superfluid density and the critical temperature\nin superconducting Nb, NbN, and underdoped $YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-{\\delta}}$ films\ndeposited on $SrTiO_{3}$ (STO). We show that these modulations are a result of\nthe STO domains and domain walls, forming below the 105 K structural phase\ntransition of STO. We found that the flow of normal current, measured above the\nsuperconducting transition, is also modulated over the same domain structure,\nsuggesting a modified carrier density. In clean STO, domain walls remain mobile\ndown to low temperatures. Modulated superconductivity over mobile channels\noffers the opportunity to locally control superconducting properties and better\nunderstand the relations between superconductivity and the local structure.\n", "  We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for an initial data set for the\nconformal Einstein field equations to give rise to a spacetime development in\npossession of a Killing spinor. This constitutes the conformal analogue of the\nKilling spinor initial data equations derived in [16]. The fact that the\nconformal Einstein field equations are used in our derivation allows for the\npossibility that the initial hypersurface be (part of) the conformal boundary\n\\mathscr{I} . For conciseness, these conditions are derived assuming that the\ninitial hypersurface is spacelike. Consequently, these equations encode\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Killing spinor in\nthe development of asymptotic initial data on spacelike components of\n\\mathscr{I} .\n", "  The 4d-transition-metals carbides (ZrC, NbC) and nitrides (ZrN, NbN) in the\nrocksalt structure, as well as their ternary alloys, have been recently studied\nby means of a first-principles full potential linearized augmented plane waves\nmethod within the local density approximation. These materials are important\nbecause of their interesting mechanical and physical properties, which make\nthem suitable for many technological applications. Here, by using a simple\ntheoretical model, we estimate the bulk moduli of their ternary alloys\nZr$_x$Nb$_{1-x}$C and Zr$_x$Nb$_{1-x}$N in terms of the bulk moduli of the end\nmembers alone. The results are comparable to those deduced from the\nfirst-principles calculations.\n", "  Several papers have recently presented results of measurements of physical\naging by studying the behavior of glassy materials quenched from temperatures\nabove their glass transition temperature $T_g$. The evolution of the aging\nprocess is usually followed by plotting the relaxed enthalpy versus the\naccompanying decrease in volume. Here, we focus on the slope of such plots,\nwhich are found to be similar to the inverse value of the isothermal\ncompressibility close to $T_g$. An explanation of this empirical result is\nattempted in the frame of a model that interconnects the defect Gibbs energy\nwith properties of the bulk material.\n", "  In molecular outflows from forming low-mass protostars, most oxygen is\nexpected to be locked up in water. However, Herschel observations have shown\nthat typically an order of magnitude or more of the oxygen is still unaccounted\nfor. To test if the oxygen is instead in atomic form, SOFIA-GREAT observed the\nR1 position of the bright molecular outflow from NGC1333-IRAS4A. The [OI] 63 um\nline is detected and spectrally resolved. From an intensity peak at +15 km/s,\nthe intensity decreases until +50 km/s. The profile is similar to that of\nhigh-velocity (HV) H2O and CO 16-15, the latter observed simultaneously with\n[OI]. A radiative transfer analysis suggests that ~15% of the oxygen is in\natomic form toward this shock position. The CO abundance is inferred to be\n~10^-4 by a similar analysis, suggesting that this is the dominant oxygen\ncarrier in the HV component. These results demonstrate that a large portion of\nthe observed [OI] emission is part of the outflow. Further observations are\nrequired to verify whether this is a general trend.\n", "  We present the results of our investigation of the star-forming potential in\nthe Perseus star-forming complex. We build on previous starless core,\nprotostellar core, and young stellar object (YSO) catalogs from Spitzer,\nHerschel, and SCUBA observations in the literature. We place the cores and YSOs\nwithin seven star-forming clumps based on column densities greater than 5x10^21\ncm^-2. We calculate the mean density and free-fall time for 69 starless cores\nas 5.55x10^-19 gcm^-3 and 0.1 Myr,respectively, and we estimate the star\nformation rate for the near future as 150 Msun Myr^-1. According to Bonnor\nEbert stability analysis, we find that majority of starless cores in Perseus\nare unstable. Broadly, these cores can collapse to form the next generation of\nstars. We found a relation between starless cores and YSOs, where the numbers\nof young protostars (Class 0 + Class I) are similar to the numbers of starless\ncores. This similarity, which shows a one-to-one relation, suggests that these\nstarless cores may form the next generation of stars with approximately the\nsame formation rate as the current generation, as identified by the Class 0 and\nClass I protostars. It follows that if such a relation between starless cores\nand any YSO stage exists, the SFR values of these two populations must be\nnearly constant. In brief, we propose that this one-to-one relation is an\nimportant factor in better understanding the star formation process within a\ncloud.\n", "  In this letter we propose an approach to obtain solutions for the nonlocal\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger hierarchy from the known ones of the\nAblowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy by reduction. These solutions are\npresented in terms of double Wronskian and some of them are new.The approach is\ngeneral and can be used for other systems with double Wronskian solutions which\nadmit local and nonlocal reductions.\n", "  The (I)nstantonic strings are described as extended states occupying a flat\n(isometry) direction on the multiple M5-brane world-volume. These are\nconstituted by 4-dimensional gauge instantons and 2-dimensional chiral axion.\nIn this light we revisit the covariant action for M5-branes by adding explicit\naxion terms. This leads to a new gauge symmetry and simple modification of some\nfield equations and the constraints in the theory. The equations of motion\ninclude a conserved toplological current of I-strings. When 6D theory is\ncompactified on a circle the light-like I-strings manifest as heavy monopole\nstates in 5D super-Yang-Mills. While extremely light I-strings tend to become\ndegenerate with the M5 vacuum but only at strong SYM coupling. This indicates\nthat 6D vacuum is infinitely degenerate.\n", "  We present a new empirical model of total and spectral solar irradiance (TSI\nand SSI) variability entitled EMPirical Irradiance REconstruction (EMPIRE). As\nwith existing empirical models, TSI and SSI variability is given by the linear\ncombination of solar activity indices. In empirical models, UV SSI variability\nis usually determined by fitting the rotational variability in activity indices\nto that in measurements. Such models have to date relied on ordinary least\nsquares regression, which ignores the uncertainty in the activity indices. In\nan advance from earlier efforts, the uncertainty in the activity indices is\naccounted for in EMPIRE by the application of an error-in-variables regression\nscheme, making the resultant UV SSI variability more robust. The result is\nconsistent with observations and unprecedentedly, with that from other\nmodelling approaches, resolving the long-standing controversy between existing\nempirical models and other types of models. We demonstrate that earlier\nempirical models, by neglecting the uncertainty in activity indices,\nunderestimate UV SSI variability. The reconstruction of TSI and visible and IR\nSSI from EMPIRE is also shown to be consistent with observations. The EMPIRE\nreconstruction is of utility to climate studies as a more robust alternative to\nearlier empirical reconstructions.\n", "  We review the Kaluza-Klein reduction of Type IIA string theory on Calabi-Yau\nfourfolds and apply mirror symmetry to the resulting two-dimensional $\n\\mathcal{N}=(2,2) $ effective theories. In the course of the reduction we focus\nespecially on non-trivial three-form cohomology on these fourfolds and\ninvestigate the couplings of the corresponding massless zero-modes. These show\na dependence on both complex structure as well as K\\\"ahler structure\ndeformations and we provide evidence that they are determined by two\nholomorphic functions that get exchanged via mirror symmetry. Application of\nthe mirror map enables us to give an explicit description of these functions at\nthe large volume and large complex structure point of the moduli space.\n", "  Rare $B$, $D$, and $K$ decays offer unique opportunities to probe for\nevidence of new particles from physics beyond the Standard Model at mass scales\nextending from the electroweak scale to well above those directly accessible at\nthe LHC. We review a selection of theoretical and experimental results on rare\n$B$, $D$, and $K$ decays illustrating the progress made during the past two\nyears.\n", "  It is of special interest in some conventional chemical technologies to\nprovide either fast mixing of reagents or rapid quenching of final chemical\nproduct. One of most promising techniques to achieve it is mixing of multiple\njets radially injected in crossflow (JIC) of cylindrical duct when jets impinge\nand form a jet flowing towards a crossflow. As result of an interaction of\ncounter-flowing jet and confined crossflow, a recirculation flow zone (RFZ)\nupstream of jets injection plane (JIP) is formed (see Fig.1). Of valuable\nimportance is to reveal upstream behavior of developed counter-flowing jet in\nconfined crossflow in order to estimate an extreme RFZ size where jets are\ndiluted and mixed under non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  In this work, we debut a new implementation of IP-Glasma and quantify the\npre-equilibrium longitudinal flow in the IP-Glasma framework. The saturation\nphysics based IP-Glasma model naturally provides a non-zero initial\nlongitudinal flow through its pre-equilibrium Yang-Mills evolution. A hybrid\nIP-Glasma+MUSIC+UrQMD frame- work is employed to test this new implementation\nagainst experimental data and to make further predictions about hadronic flow\nobservables in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Finally, the non-zero\npre-equilibrium longitudinal flow of the IP-Glasma model is quantified, and its\norigin is briefly discussed.\n", "  We simulate the expected variations of background flux at two particular\nsites of the Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) and found that these\nfluxes are sensible to the latitude and that neutrons and muons components, of\ncosmic rays, are affected due to the variation of the geomagnetic field (GF).\n", "  The aim of my dissertation is to investigate habitability in extra-Solar\nSystems. Most of the time, only planets are considered as possible places where\nextraterrestrial life can emerge and evolve, however, their moons could be\ninhabited, too. I present a comprehensive study, which considers habitability\nnot only on planets, but on satellites, as well. My research focuses on three\nclosely related topics. The first one is the circumstellar habitable zone,\nwhich is usually used as a first proxy for determining the habitability of a\nplanet around the host star. The word habitability is used in the sense that\nliquid water, which is essential for life as we know it, may be present on the\nplanetary surface. Whether the planet is habitable or not, its moon might have\na suitable surface temperature for holding water reservoirs, providing that\ntidal heating is in action. Tidal heating is generated inside the satellite and\nits source is the strong gravitational force of the nearby planet. The second\ntopic of my research explores tidal heating and the habitability of extra-solar\nmoons with and without stellar radiation and other related energy sources. Life\nis possible to form even on icy planetary bodies, inside tidally heated\nsubsurface oceans. The third topic probes the possibility of identifying an\nice-covered satellite from photometric observations. A strong indication of\nsurface ice is the high reflectance of the body, which may be measured when the\nmoon disappears behind the host star, so its reflected light is blocked out by\nthe star.\n", "  We present a simple bottom-up approach via an incoherent unpolarized\nillumination and the choice of a solvent-droplet-induced-dewetting method to\nphotoinducenano doughnuts on the surface of azopolymer thin films. We\ndemonstrate that doughnut-shaped nanostructures can be formed and tailored with\na wide range of typical sizes, thus providing a rich field of applications\nusing surface photo-patterning. Furthermore, due to the presence of highly\nphotoactive azobenzene derivative in the material, illumination of these\nnanostructures by a polarized laser light shows the possibility of a further\ngrowth and reshaping opening the way for fundamental studies of size-dependent\nscaling laws of optical properties and possible fabrication of nano-reactor or\nnano-trap patterns\n", "  We present a new catalog of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12). This was obtained by a\nsystematic analysis through modeling of the continuum and emission lines of the\nspectra of all the 68,859 SDSS DR12 objects that are classified as \"QSO\" by the\nSDSS spectroscopic pipeline with z < 0.8 and a median signal-to-noise ratio\n(S/N) > 2 per pixel. This catalog contains a total of 11,101 objects, which is\nabout 5 times larger than the previously known NLSy1 galaxies. Their\nmonochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 A is found to be strongly correlated\nwith H-beta, H-alpha, and [O III] emission line luminosities. The optical Fe II\nstrength in NLSy1 galaxies is about two times larger than the broad- line\nSeyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. About 5% of the catalog sources are detected in the\nFIRST survey. The Eddington ratio (XEdd) of NLSy1 galaxies has an average of\nlog XEdd of -0.34, much higher than -1.03 found for BLSy1 galaxies. Their black\nhole masses (MBH) have an average of log MBH of 6.9 Msun, which is less than\nBLSy1 galaxies, which have an average of log MBH of 8.0 Msun. The MBH of NLSy1\ngalaxies is found to be correlated with their host galaxy velocity dispersion.\nOur analysis suggests that geometrical effects playing an important role in\ndefining NLSy1 galaxies and their MBH deficit is perhaps due to their lower\ninclination compared to BLSy1 galaxies.\n", "  We study the interaction of circumcoronene molecule C$_{54}$H$_{18}$ with\ncobalt in the form of atoms, dimers and clusters of four atoms. We find that\nthe cobalt atom prefers to be on a hollow site in the edge zone. The cobalt\ndimer is bonded perpendicularly to another different hollow site in the edge\nzone. The Co$_{4}$ cluster adopts a tetrahedral shape with a face parallel to\ncircumcoronene, placing each of the three atoms over contiguous hollow sites,\nstarting from the edge. Cobalt remains bonded to circumcoronene as Co$_{2}$\nmolecules or Co$_{4}$ clusters, rather than spread as isolated atoms, because\nthe cobalt-cobalt interaction is stronger than the cobalt-carbon one. However,\nthe interaction with cobalt clusters induce small magnetic moment on\ncircumcoronene. The magnetic moment of cobalt counterpart is reduced when it is\nbonded to circumcoronene. There is charge transfer between those systems and\nits direction depends on the relative position of the cluster with respect to\ncircumcoronene.\n", "  Berry phase polarization calculations have been investigated for several\nferroelectric materials from the point of view of practical calculations. It\nwas shown that interpretation of the results is particular to each case due to\nthe multivalued aspect of polarization in the modern theory. Almost all of the\nstudied examples show ambiguous polarization results which can be difficult to\nsolve especially for super-cells containing large number of atoms. For this\nreason, a procedure has been proposed to minimize the number of calculations\nrequired to produce an unambiguous polarization result from Berry phase\npolarization investigations.\n", "  The Kundu-Eckhaus equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation which\nseems in the quantum field theory, weakly nonlinear dispersive water waves and\nnonlinear optics. In spite of its importance, exact solution to this nonlinear\nequation are rarely found in literature. In this work, we solve this equation\nand present a new approach to obtain the solution by means of the combined use\nof the Adomian Decomposition Method and the Laplace Transform (LADM). Besides,\nwe compare the behaviour of the solutions obtained with the only exact\nsolutions given in the literature through fractional calculus. Moreover, it is\nshown that the proposed method is direct, effective and can be used for many\nother nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.\n", "  We study experimental background reconstruction methods for the measurement\nof $D-\\overline{D}$ correlation using a PYTHIA simulation. Like-sign and\nside-band background methods that are widely used in the experimental\nmeasurements of single $D$-meson production yields were deployed for the\ncorrelation background study. It is found that the like-sign method which well\ndescribes the combinatorial background of single $D^{0}$ meson yields fails to\nreproduce the correlated background in the $D^{0}-\\overline{D^{0}}$ correlation\nmeasurement, while the side-band background method yields a good description of\nthe background for both the single $D^0$ yields and of the correlated\nbackground of the $D^{0}-\\overline{D^{0}}$ correlation measurement.\n", "  We have theoretically studied the uptake of a non-uniformly charged\nbiomolecule, suitable to represent a globular protein or a drug, by a charged\nhydrogel carrier in the presence of a 1:1 electrolyte. Based on the analysis of\na physical interaction Hamiltonian including monopolar, dipolar and Born\n(self-energy) contributions derived from linear electrostatic theory of the\nunperturbed homogeneous hydrogel, we have identified five different sorption\nstates of the system, from complete repulsion of the molecule to its full\nsorption deep inside the hydrogel, passing through meta- and stable surface\nadsorption states. The results are summarized in state diagrams that also\nexplore the effects of varying the electrolyte concentration, the sign of the\nnet electric charge of the biomolecule, and the role of including\nexcluded-volume (steric) or hydrophobic biomolecule-hydrogel interactions. We\nshow that the dipole moment of the biomolecule is a key parameter controlling\nthe spatial distribution of the globules. In particular, biomolecules with a\nlarge dipole moment tend to be adsorbed at the external surface of the\nhydrogel, even if like-charged, whereas uniformly charged biomolecules tend to\npartition towards the internal core of an oppositely-charged hydrogel.\nHydrophobic attraction shifts the states towards internal sorption of the\nbiomolecule, whereas steric repulsion promotes surface adsorption for\noppositely-charged biomolecules, or the total exclusion for likely-charged\nones. Our results establish a guidance for the spatial partitioning of proteins\nand drugs in hydrogel carriers, tuneable by hydrogel charge, pH and salt\nconcentration.\n", "  We measure the field dependence of spin glass free energy barriers in a thin\namorphous Ge:Mn film through the time dependence of the magnetization. After\nthe correlation length $\\xi(t, T)$ has reached the film thickness $\\mathcal\n{L}=155$~\\AA~so that the dynamics are activated, we change the initial magnetic\nfield by $\\delta H$. In agreement with the scaling behavior exhibited in a\ncompanion Letter [Janus collaboration: M. Baity-Jesi {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 118}, 157202 (2017)], we find the activation energy is increased\nwhen $\\delta H < 0$. The change is proportional to $(\\delta H)^2$ with the\naddition of a small $(\\delta H)^4$ term. The magnitude of the change of the\nspin glass free energy barriers is in near quantitative agreement with the\nprediction of a barrier model.\n", "  We first reproduce on the Janus and Janus II computers a milestone experiment\nthat measures the spin-glass coherence length through the lowering of\nfree-energy barriers induced by the Zeeman effect. Secondly we determine the\nscaling behavior that allows a quantitative analysis of a new experiment\nreported in the companion Letter [S. Guchhait and R. Orbach, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n118, 157203 (2017)]. The value of the coherence length estimated through the\nanalysis of microscopic correlation functions turns out to be quantitatively\nconsistent with its measurement through macroscopic response functions.\nFurther, non-linear susceptibilities, recently measured in glass-forming\nliquids, scale as powers of the same microscopic length.\n", "  We consider a full set of harmonics for the Stokes wave in deep water in the\nabsence of viscosity, and examine the role that higher harmonics play in\nmodifying the classical Benjamin-Feir instability. Using a representation of\nthe wave coefficients due to Wilton, a perturbation analysis shows that the\nStokes wave may become unbounded due to interactions between the $N^{th}$\nharmonic of the primary wave train and a set of harmonics of a disturbance. If\nthe frequency of the $n^{th}$ harmonic is denoted $ \\omega _{n} =\\omega \\left(\n{1 \\pm \\delta } \\right)$ then instability will occur if $$ 0<\\delta\n<\\frac{\\sqrt 2\\ k\\,n^ns_n }{\\left( {n-1} \\right)!} $$ subject to the\ndisturbance initially having sufficiently large amplitude. We show that,\nsubject to initial conditions, all lower harmonics will contribute to\ninstability as well, and we identify the frequency of the disturbance\ncorresponding to maximum growth rate.\n", "  Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is one of\nthe classical exactly solvable models in the KPZ universality class. We study\nthe \"slow bond\" model, where TASEP on $\\mathbb{Z}$ is imputed with a slow bond\nat the origin. The slow bond increases the particle density immediately to its\nleft and decreases the particle density immediately to its right. Whether or\nnot this effect is detectable in the macroscopic current started from the step\ninitial condition has attracted much interest over the years and this question\nwas settled recently (Basu, Sidoravicius, Sly (2014)) by showing that the\ncurrent is reduced even for arbitrarily small strength of the defect. Following\nnon-rigorous physics arguments (Janowsky, Lebowitz (1992, 1994)) and some\nunpublished works by Bramson, a conjectural description of properties of\ninvariant measures of TASEP with a slow bond at the origin was provided in\nLiggett's 1999 book. We establish Liggett's conjectures and in particular show\nthat TASEP with a slow bond at the origin, started from step initial condition,\nconverges in law to an invariant measure that is asymptotically close to\nproduct measures with different densities far away from the origin towards left\nand right. Our proof exploits the correspondence between TASEP and the last\npassage percolation on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with exponential weights and uses the\nunderstanding of geometry of maximal paths in those models.\n", "  Context. Globular clusters host stars with chemical peculiarities. The\nassociated helium enrichment is expected to affect the evolution of stars, in\ngeneral, and of low-mass stars, and in particular the progenitors of white\ndwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the effects of different initial helium\ncontents on the properties of white dwarfs such as their masses, compositions,\nand the time since their formation. Results. In a globular cluster at a given\nage, the He enrichment implies lower initial masses for stars at a given phase.\nThus it leads to a decrease of the masses of white dwarfs reaching the cooling\nsequence. In addition the He enrichment increases the total mass and number of\nwhite dwarfs and eventually allows the presence of He white dwarf from single\nprogenitors. Conclusions. The low He enrichment determined in most globular\nclusters with different methods results in negligible effects on the white\ndwarf properties. However, in the few globular clusters that display a high He\nenrichment, this may significantly affect the characteristics of the white\ndwarfs. In NGC 2808 and {\\omega} Centauri the high He enrichment even leads to\nthe formation of He white dwarfs from single He-rich progenitors. Therefore\ninvestigating the white dwarf mass domain in globular clusters with a high He\nenrichment would provide an additional indirect way to measure and constrain\nthe He enrichment degree.\n", "  SPI, the Spectrometer on board the ESA INTEGRAL satellite, to be launched in\nOctober 2002, will study the gamma-ray sky in the 20 keV to 8 MeV energy band\nwith a spectral resolution of 2 keV for photons of 1 MeV, thanks to its 19\ngermanium detectors spanning an active area of 500 cm2. A coded mask imaging\ntechnique provides a 2 deg angular resolution. The 16 deg field of view is\ndefined by an active BGO veto shield, furthermore used for background\nrejection. In April 2001 the flight model of SPI underwent a one-month\ncalibration campaign at CEA in Bruy\\`eres le Ch\\^atel using low intensity\nradioactive sources and the CEA accelerator for homogeneity measurements and\nhigh intensity radioactive sources for imaging performance measurements. After\nintegration of all scientific payloads (the spectrometer SPI, the imager IBIS\nand the monitors JEM-X and OMC) on the INTEGRAL satellite, a cross-calibration\ncampaign has been performed at the ESA center in Noordwijk. A set of sources\nhas been placed in the field of view of the different instruments in order to\ncompare their performances and determine their mutual influence. Some of those\nsources had already been used in Bruy\\`eres during the SPI standalone test. For\nthe lowest energy band calibration an X-ray generator has been used. We report\non the scientific goals of this calibration activity, and present the\nmeasurements performed as well as some preliminary results.\n", "  The unidentified TeV source in Cygnus is now confirmed by follow-up\nobservations from 2002 with the HEGRA stereoscopic system of Cherenkov\nTelescopes. Using all data (1999 to 2002) we confirm this new source as steady\nin flux over the four years of data taking, extended with radius 6.2 arcmin\n(+-1.2 arcmin (stat) +-0.9 arcmin (sys)) and exhibiting a hard spectrum with\nphoton index -1.9. It is located in the direction of the dense OB stellar\nassociation, Cygnus OB2. Its integral flux above energies E>1 TeV amounts to\n\\~5% of the Crab assuming a Gaussian profile for the intrinsic source\nmorphology. There is no obvious counterpart at radio, optical nor X-ray\nenergies, leaving TeVJ2032+4130 presently unidentified. Observational\nparameters of this source are updated here and some astrophysical discussion is\nprovided. Also included are upper limits for a number of other interesting\nsources in the FoV, including the famous microquasar Cygnus X-3.\n", "  A distribution of points that satisfies the property of local isotropy is not\nnecessarily homogeneous: homogeneity is implied by the condition of local\nisotropy together with the assumption of analyticity or regularity. Here we\nshow that the evidence of dipole saturation in galaxies (and clusters)\ncatalogues, together with a monotone growth of the monopole, is an evidence of\nisotropy but not of homogeneity. This is fully compatible with a fractal\nstructure which has the property of local isotropy, but it is non-analytic and\nnon-homogeneous.\n", "  We analyze the spatial and the luminosity properties of the Perseus-Pisces\nredshift survey. We find that the two point correlation function (CF)\n$\\Gamma(r)$ is a power law up to the sample effective depth ($\\sim 30\nh^{-1}Mpc$), showing the fractal nature of the galaxy distribution in this\ncatalog. The fractal dimension turns out to be $D \\approx 2$. We also consider\nthe CF $\\xi(r)$ and in particular the behavior of the \"{\\it correlation\nlength}\" $r_0$ ($\\xi(r_{0})\\equiv 1$) as function of the sample size. In this\nrespect we find, unambiguously, that the luminosity segregation effect is not\nsupported by any experimental evidence. In addition we have studied the\ngalaxian number-density ($n(r)$) and number-counts ($N(m)$) in the VL\nsubsamples finding a good agreement with the properties of a fractal\ndistribution. In particular our conclusion is that the $n(r)$ relation allows\nto extend the analysis of the fractal nature up to a deeper depth than that\nreached by the CF analysis, and, we find evidence for fractal properties up to\nthe limiting depth of $120-140 h^{-1} Mpc$. We stress that the $N(m)$ relation\nmust be studied in VL subsamples rather than in magnitude limited ones as\nusually done. Finally we have considered the correlations between galaxy\npositions and luminosities by means of the multifractal analysis. We find clear\nevidence for self-similar behavior of the whole luminosity-space distribution.\nThese results confirm and extend those of Coleman \\& Pietronero (1992).\n", "  The irreducible Freedman-Townsend vertex is derived by means of the\nHamiltonian deformation procedure based on local BRST cohomology.\n", "  We describe the partial breaking of $N=1 D=10$ supersymmetry down to $(1,0)\nd=6$ supersymmetry within the non-linear realization approach. The basic\nGoldstone superfield associated with this breaking is shown to be the $(1,0)\nd=6$ hypermultiplet superfield $q^{ia}$ subjected to a non-linear\ngeneralization of the standard hypermultiplet superfield constraint. The\ndynamical equations implied by this constraint are identified as the manifestly\nworldvolume supersymmetric equations of the Type I super 5-brane in D=10. We\ngive arguments in favour of existence of an appropriate brane extension of\noff-shell hypermultiplet actions in harmonic superspace. Some related problems,\nin particular, the issue of utilizing other $(1,0) d=6$ supermultiplets as\nGoldstone ones, are shortly discussed.\n", "  We review our calculation of the Weyl anomaly for d-dimensional conformal\nfield theories that have a description in terms of a (d + 1)-dimensional\ngravity theory.\n", "  We review briefly generalized Freedman-Townsend models found recently by\nHenneaux and Knaepen, and provide supersymmetric versions of such models in\nfour dimensions which couple 2-form gauge potentials and ordinary gauge fields\nin a gauge invariant and supersymmetric manner. The latter models have the\nunusual feature that, in a WZ gauge, the supersymmetry transformations do not\ncommute with all the gauge transformations.\n", "  We discuss the field theory limit of Dp-branes. In this limit, the black\nDp-brane solution approaches a solution which is conformal to adS_{p+2} \\times\nS^{8-p}. We argue that the frame in which the conformal factor is equal to one,\nthe dual frame, is a `holographic' frame. The radial coordinate of adS_{p+2}\nprovides a UV/IR connection as in the case of the D3 brane. The gravitational\ndescription involves gauged supergravities, typically with non-compact gauge\ngroups. The near-horizon Dp-brane solution becomes a domain-wall solution of\nthe latter.\n", "  This is an introduction to the Maldacena conjecture on the equivalence\nbetween ${\\cal{N}}=4$ super Yang-Mills in Minkowski space-time and type IIB\nstring theory compactified on $AdS_5 \\otimes S_5 $.\n", "  We review the construction of 4D, N =2 globally supersymmetric off-shell\nnonlinear sigma models whose target spaces are the cotangent bundles of\nK\\\"ahler manifolds.\n", "  The interaction between static D0-branes at finite temperature is considered\nin the matrix theory and the superstring theory. The results agree in both\ncases to the leading order in the supersymmetry violation by temperature, where\nthe one-loop approximation is reliable. The effective static potential is\nshort-ranged and attractive.\n  Talk at the 32nd International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of\nElementary Particles, Buckow, Germany, September 1-5, 1998.\n", "  A description of the one-loop approximation formula for the partition\nfunction of a three-dimensional abelian version of the Donaldson-Witten theory\nis proposed. The one-loop expression is shown to contain such topological\ninvariants of a three-dimensional manifold M like the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer\ntorsion and Betti numbers.\n", "  Effectiveness of using laser field to produce entanglement between two\ndipole-interacting identical two-level atoms is considered in detail. The\nentanglement is achieved by driving the system with a carefully designed laser\npulse transferring the system's population to one of the maximally entangled\nDicke states in a way analogous to population inversion by a resonant\n$\\pi$-pulse in a two-level atom. It is shown that for the optimally chosen\npulse frequency, power and duration, the fidelity of generating a maximally\nentangled state approaches unity as the distance between the atoms goes to\nzero.\n", "  Statistical tests are needed to determine experimentally whether a\nhypothetical theory based on local realism can be an acceptable alternative to\nquantum mechanics. It is impossible to rule out local realism by a single test,\nas often claimed erroneously. The ``strength'' of a particular Bell inequality\nis measured by the number of trials that are needed to invalidate local realism\nat a given confidence level. Various versions of Bell's inequality are compared\nfrom this point of view. It is shown that Mermin's inequality for\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states requires fewer tests than the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality or than its chained variants applied to a\nsinglet state, and also than Hardy's proof of nonlocality.\n", "  We present a method of generation of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state\ninvolving type II and type I parametric downconversion, and triggering\nphotodetectors. The state generated by the proposed experimental set-up can be\nreconstructed through multi-mode quantum homodyne tomography. The feasibility\nof the measurement is studied on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  Recent experimental tests of the symmetrization postulate of quantum\nmechanics are discussed. It is shown that in a strict sense these experiments\ncannot test the validity of the symmetrization postulate, but in most cases do\ntest the spin-statistics connection. An experiment is proposed that would allow\nto search for possible violations of the symmetrization postulate.\n", "  This article presents a Hamiltonian lattice formulation of static Casimir\nsystems at a level of generality appropriate for an introductory investigation.\nBackground structure - represented by a lattice potential V(x) - is introduced\nalong one spatial direction with translation invariance in all other spatial\ndirections.
