In this paper, we study the collision of two particles in the\ncase of four-dimensional charged nonrotating, extremal charged rotating and\nnear-extremal charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes as well as the naked\nsingularity case in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We find that the\ncenter-of-mass energy for a pair of colliding particles is unlimited at the\nhorizon of charged nonrotating Kaluza-Klein black holes, extremal charged\nrotating Kaluza-Klein black holes and in the naked singularity case.\n", "  The relationship between the applied elastic strain gradient and the induced\nelectric polarization in the alpha-phase polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films\nunder bending conditions has been investigated. Our experimental studies have\nshown that the flexoelectric polarization is linearly proportional to the\nstrain gradient and the corresponding direct flexoelectric response is strong.\nIt is reasonable to believe that the physical mechanisms behind the\nflexoelectric effects in polymers and solid dielectrics are different.\n", "  This is an introductory review of topological field theories (TFTs) called\nAKSZ sigma models. The AKSZ construction is a mathematical formulation for the\nconstruction and analyses of a large class of TFTs, inspired by the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism of gauge theories. We begin by considering a\nsimple two-dimensional topological field theory and explain the ideas of the\nAKSZ sigma models. This construction is then generalized and leads to a\nmathematical formulation of a general topological sigma model. We review the\nmathematical objects, such as algebroids and supergeometry, that are used in\nthe analysis of general gauge structures. The quantization of the Poisson sigma\nmodel is presented as an example of a quantization of an AKSZ sigma model.\n", "  Historically Gordon decomposition of Dirac current played an important role\nin the interpretation of Dirac equation. We revisit it to understand the\ncorrespondence between Maxwell-Dirac and Maxwell-Lorentz theories. Arguments\nare presented to show that classical charge current corresponds to Gordon\ncurrent. Consistency with Maxwell-Dirac theory leads to a new result:\nantisymmetric spin tensor in spin magnetization current of Dirac electron must\nbe hidden as internal part of classical Maxwell tensor. It becomes natural to\nextend our previous interpretation in which electromagnetic field tensor\nrepresents angular momentum of photon or spacetime fluid (aether!) in the\npresence of sources such that the duality between field and source disappears.\nBoth Gordon current and spin current are proposed to have 'spinning origin'.\nFormal expression of Gordon current makes it possible to apply the idea of\noptical vortex in this case, and quantized vortex and quantized orbital angular\nmomentum could be related with the conjecture of mechanical interpretation of\nelectric charge. Separate mass and charge centers for spinning point charge are\nwell known in the literature; we discuss them in the context of two-vortex\nmodel of electron and Gordon decomposition.\n", "  The production of K$^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ and $\\phi$(1020) in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV was measured by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The yields\nand the transverse momentum spectra d$^{2}$N/d$y$d$p_{\\rm T}$ at midrapidity\n$|y|<0.5$ in the range $0<p_{\\rm T}<6$ GeV/$c$ for K$^{*}$(892)$^{0}$ and\n$0.4<p_{\\rm T}<6$ GeV/$c$ for $\\phi$(1020) are reported and compared to model\npredictions. Using the yield of pions, kaons, and Omega baryons measured\npreviously by ALICE at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, the ratios K$^{*}$/K$^{-}$,\n$\\phi$/K$^{*}$, $\\phi$/K$^{-}$, $\\phi/\\pi^{-}$, and ($\\Omega$ +\n$\\overline{\\Omega}$)/$\\phi$ are presented. The values of the K$^{*}$/K$^{-}$,\n$\\phi$/K$^{*}$ and $\\phi$/K$^{-}$ ratios are similar to those found at lower\ncentre-of-mass energies. In contrast, the $\\phi/\\pi^{-}$ ratio, which has been\nobserved to increase with energy, seems to saturate above 200 GeV. The\n($\\Omega$ + $\\overline{\\Omega}$)/$\\phi$ ratio in the $p_{\\rm T}$ range $1$-$5$\nGeV/$c$ is found to be in good agreement with the prediction of the HIJING/BB\nv2.0 model with a strong colour field.\n", "  The ALICE collaboration has made the first measurement at the LHC of J/$\\psi$\nphotoproduction in ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb-collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ =\n2.76 TeV. The J/$\\psi$ is identified via its dimuon decay in the forward\nrapidity region with the muon spectrometer for events where the hadronic\nactivity is required to be minimal. The analysis is based on an event sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 55 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$. The cross\nsection for coherent J/$\\psi$ production in the rapidity interval $-3.6 < y <\n-2.6$ is measured to be d$\\sigma$/d$y = 1.00 \\pm 0.18$ (stat) $+0.24/-0.26$\n(syst) mb. The result is compared to theoretical models for coherent J/$\\psi$\nproduction and found to be in good agreement with models which include nuclear\ngluon shadowing.\n", "  We formulate the initial value problem for causal variational principles in\nthe continuous setting on a compact metric space. The existence and uniqueness\nof solutions is analyzed. The results are illustrated by simple examples.\n", "  We investigate charged particles circular motion in the gravitational field\nof a charged mass distribution described by the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime.\nWe introduce a set of independent parameters completely characterizing the\ndifferent spatial regions in which circular motion is allowed. We provide most\ncomplete classification of circular orbits for different sets of particle and\nsource charge-to-mass ratios. We study both black holes and naked singularities\nand show that the behavior of charged particles depend drastically on the type\nof source. Our analysis shows in an alternative manner that the behavior of\ncircular orbits can in principle be used to distinguish between black holes and\nnaked singularities. From this analysis, special limiting values for the\ndimensionless charge of black hole and naked singularity emerge, namely,\nQ/M=1/2, $Q/M=\\sqrt{13}/5$ and $Q/M=\\sqrt{2/3}$ for the black hole case and\nQ/M=1, $Q/M=5/ (2 \\sqrt{6})$, $Q/M=3 \\sqrt{6}/7$, and finally $Q/M= \\sqrt{9/8}$\nfor the naked singularity case. Similarly and surprisingly, analogue limits\nemerge for the orbiting particles charge-to-mass ratio $\\epsilon$, for positive\ncharges $\\epsilon=1$, $\\epsilon=2$ and $\\epsilon=M/Q$. These limits play an\nimportant role in the study of the coupled electromagnetic and gravitational\ninteractions, and the investigation of the role of the charge in the\ngravitational collapse of compact objects.\n", "  The relationship between elastic fatigue and electrical cyclic loading in\nalpha-phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) films has been investigated. Our\nexperimental studies have shown that the electric-field-induced fatigue\nbehavior can be described by a stress relaxation, which belongs to the\nKohlrausch function group, and the corresponding exponent is a modified\ntwo-parameter Weibull distribution function.\n", "  We present a linear-response formalism for a system of correlated electrons\nout of equilibrium, as relevant for the probe optical absorption in pump-probe\nexperiments. We consider the time dependent optical conductivity\n$\\sigma(\\omega,t)$ and its nonequilibrium properties. As an application we\nnumerically study a single highly excited charged particle in the spin\nbackground, as described within the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model. Our results\nshow that the optical sum rule approaches the equilibrium-like one very fast,\nhowever, the time evolution and the final asymptotic behavior of the absorption\nspectra in the finite systems considered still reveal dependence on the type of\ninitial pump perturbation. This is observed in the evolution of its main\nfeatures: the mid-infrared peak and the Drude weight.\n", "  This article is concerned with the mathematical analysis of the perturbation\nmethod for extended Kohn-Sham models, in which fractional occupation numbers\nare allowed. All our results are established in the framework of the reduced\nHartree-Fock (rHF) model, but our approach can be used to study other kinds of\nextended Kohn-Sham models, under some assumptions on the mathematical structure\nof the exchange- correlation functional. The classical results of Density\nFunctional Perturbation Theory in the non-degenerate case (that is when the\nFermi level is not a degenerate eigenvalue of the mean-field Hamiltonian) are\nformalized, and a proof of Wigner's (2n + 1) rule is provided. We then focus on\nthe situation when the Fermi level is a degenerate eigenvalue of the rHF\nHamiltonian, which had not been considered so far.\n", "  Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) the COS Science Team has conducted a high signal-to-noise survey of 14\nbright QSOs. In a previous paper (Savage et al. 2014) these far-UV spectra were\nused to discover 14 \"warm\" ($T > 10^5$ K) absorbers using a combination of\nbroad Ly\\alpha\\ and O VI absorptions. A reanalysis of a few of this new class\nof absorbers using slightly relaxed fitting criteria finds as many as 20 warm\nabsorbers could be present in this sample. A shallow, wide spectroscopic galaxy\nredshift survey has been conducted around these sight lines to investigate the\nwarm absorber environment, which is found to be spiral-rich galaxy groups or\ncluster outskirts with radial velocity dispersions of \\sigma\\ = 250-750 km/s.\nWhile 2\\sigma\\ evidence is presented favoring the hypothesis that these\nabsorptions are associated with the galaxy groups and not with the individual,\nnearest galaxies, this evidence has considerable systematic uncertainties and\nis based on a small sample size so it is not entirely conclusive. If the\nassociations are with galaxy groups, the observed frequency of warm absorbers\n(dN/dz = 3.5-5 per unit redshift) requires them to be very large (~1 Mpc in\nradius at high covering factor). Most likely these warm absorbers are interface\ngas clouds whose presence implies the existence of a hotter ($T \\sim 10^{6.5}$\nK), diffuse and probably very massive ($>10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$) intra-group medium\nwhich has yet to be detected directly.\n", "  We present two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocols\nbased on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as efficient quantum sensors\nof protein structure. Continuous microwave driving fields are used to achieve\nHartmann-Hahn resonances between NV spin sensor and proximate nuclei for\nselective control of nuclear spins and measurement of their polarization. Our\nprotocols take advantage of the strong coupling between the NV sensor and the\nnuclei, thus facilitating coherence control of nuclear spins and relax the\nrequirement of nuclear spin polarization. We dramatically reduce the\nexperimental effort by employing a singular value thresholding matrix\ncompletion algorithm from signal processing to regain the resolution of protein\nstructure based on sub-sampled data from NV based single molecule nuclear\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy. As an illustration, we demonstrate the power\nof this approach by identifying the nitrogen-Hydrogen interaction peak in an\nAlanine spectrum based on merely 5% of the sample data.\n", "  We present new GALEX images and optical spectroscopy of J1229+02, a dwarf\npost-starburst galaxy located 81 kpc from the 1585 km/s absorber in the 3C 273\nsight line. The absence of H\\alpha\\ emission and the faint GALEX UV fluxes\nconfirm that the galaxy's recent star formation rate is $<10^{-3}\nM_{\\odot}$/yr. Absorption-line strengths and the UV-optical SED give similar\nestimates of the acceptable model parameters for its youngest stellar\npopulation where $f_m$ < 60% of its total stars (by mass) formed in a burst\n$t_sb$ = 0.7-3.4 Gyr ago with a stellar metallicity of -1.7 < [Fe/H] < +0.2; we\nalso estimate the stellar mass of J1229+02 to be 7.3 < log($M_*/M_{\\odot}$) <\n7.8. Our previous study of J1229+02 found that a supernova-driven wind was\ncapable of expelling all of the gas from the galaxy (none is observed today)\nand could by itself plausibly create the nearby absorber. But, using new data,\nwe find a significantly higher galaxy/absorber velocity difference, a younger\nstarburst age, and a smaller starburst mass than previously reported. Simple\nenergy-conserving wind models for J1229+02 using fiducial values of $f_m$ ~\n0.1, $t_sb$ ~ 2 Gyr, and log(M$_*/M_{\\odot}$) ~ 7.5 allow us to conclude that\nthe galaxy alone cannot produce the observed QSO absorber; i.e., any putative\nejecta must interact with ambient gas from outside J1229+02. Because J1229+02\nis located in the southern extension of the Virgo cluster ample potential\nsources of this ambient gas exist. Based on the two nearest examples of strong\nmetal-line absorbers discovered serendipitously (the current one and the 1700\nkm/s metal-line absorber in the nearby Q1230+0115 sight line), we conclude that\nabsorbers with $10^{14} < N_{HI} < 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ at impact parameters\n>1$R_{vir}$ are likely intergalactic systems and cannot be identified\nunambiguously as the circumgalactic material of any one individual galaxy.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the polarization properties of the quantum dot's\noptical emission from chiral photonic crystal structures made of achiral\nmaterials in the absence of external magnetic field at room temperature. The\nmirror symmetry of the local electromagnetic field is broken in this system due\nto the decreased symmetry of the chiral modulated layer. As a result, the\nradiation of randomly polarized quantum dots normal to the structure becomes\npartially circularly polarized. The sign and degree of circular polarization\nare determined by the geometry of the chiral modulated structure and depend on\nthe radiation frequency. A degree of circular polarization up to 99% can be\nachieved for randomly distributed quantum dots, and can be close to 100% for\nsome single quantum dots.\n", "  We present a covariant and gauge invariant formalism suited to the study of\nsecond-order effects associated with higher order tensor perturbations. The\nanalytical method we have developed enables us to characterize pure\nsecond-order tensor perturbations about FLRW model having different kinds of\nequations of state. Our analysis of the radiation case suggests that it may be\nfeasible to examine the CMB polarization arising from higher order\nperturbations.\n", "  We study how the propagation speed of interfaces in the Allen-Cahn phase\nfield model for phase transformations in solids consisting of the elasticity\nequations and the Allen-Cahn equation depends on two parameters of the model.\nThe two parameters control the interface energy and the interface width but\nchange also the interface speed. To this end we derive an asymptotic expansion\nof second order for the interface speed, called the kinetic relation, and prove\nthat it is uniformly valid in both parameters. As a consequence we show that\nthe model error is proportional to the interface width divided by the interface\nenergy. We conclude that simulations of interfaces with low interface energy\nbased on this model require a very small interface width, implying a large\nnumerical effort. Effective simulations thus need adaptive mesh refinement or\nother advanced techniques. This version of the paper contains the proofs of\nTheorem 4.5 and Lemma 5.8, which are omitted in the version published in\nContinuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics.\n", "  A new method is proposed to derive rigorous bounds on {\\eta}, the growth rate\nof the logarithm of the number of independent sets on a hexagonal lattice.\nSpecifically, we prove that 1.546440708536001 <= {\\eta} <= 1.5513, which\nimproves upon the best known 1.5463 <= {\\eta} <= 1.5527 due to Nagy and Zeger.\nOur lower bound matches the numerical estimate of Baxter up to 9 digits after\nthe decimal point.\n", "  Alpha decays in the EXO-200 detector are used to measure the fraction of\ncharged $^{218}\\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\\mathrm{Bi}$ daughters created from\nalpha and beta decays, respectively. $^{222}\\mathrm{Rn}$ alpha decays in liquid\nxenon (LXe) are found to produce $^{218}\\mathrm{Po}^{+}$ ions $50.3 \\pm 3.0\\%$\nof the time, while the remainder of the $^{218}\\mathrm{Po}$ atoms are neutral.\nThe fraction of $^{214}\\mathrm{Bi}^{+}$ from $^{214}\\mathrm{Pb}$ beta decays in\nLXe is found to be $76.4 \\pm 5.7\\%$, inferred from the relative rates of\n$^{218}\\mathrm{Po}$ and $^{214}\\mathrm{Po}$ alpha decays in the LXe. The\naverage velocity of $^{218}\\mathrm{Po}$ ions is observed to decrease for longer\ndrift times. Initially the ions have a mobility of $0.390 \\pm\n0.006~\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{s})$, and at long drift times the\nmobility is $0.219 \\pm 0.004~\\mathrm{cm}^2/(\\mathrm{kV}~\\mathrm{s})$. Time\nconstants associated with the change in mobility during drift of the\n$^{218}\\mathrm{Po}^{+}$ ions are found to be proportional to the electron\nlifetime in the LXe.\n", "  We have identified epitaxially grown elemental Te as a capping material that\nis suited to protect the topological surface states of intrinsically insulating\nBi$_2$Te$_3$. By using angle-resolved photoemission, we were able to show that\nthe Te overlayer leaves the dispersive bands of the surface states intact and\nthat it does not alter the chemical potential of the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin film.\nFrom in-situ four-point contact measurements, we observed that the conductivity\nof the capped film is still mainly determined by the metallic surface states\nand that the contribution of the capping layer is minor. Moreover, the Te\noverlayer can be annealed away in vacuum to produce a clean Bi$_2$Te$_3$\nsurface in its pristine state even after the exposure of the capped film to\nair. Our findings will facilitate well-defined and reliable ex-situ experiments\non the properties of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface states with nontrivial topology.\n", "  We study nonlinear sigma model, especially Skyrme model with twist (twisted\nSkyrmion string) where twist term $mkz$ is indicated in vortex solution. We\nstudy topological and Hopf charges of a twisted Skyrmion string. We show that\nthe Hopf charge is exist in our twisting solutions like the twisted Skyrmion\nstring.\n", "  We derive a generalization of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that uses\nBayesian updates to explicitly incorporate the effects of a measurement of a\nsystem at some point in its evolution. By allowing an experimenter's knowledge\nto be updated by the measurement process, this formulation resolves a tension\nbetween the fact that the entropy of a statistical system can sometimes\nfluctuate downward and the information-theoretic idea that knowledge of a\nstochastically-evolving system degrades over time. The Bayesian Second Law can\nbe written as $\\Delta H(\\rho_m, \\rho) + \\langle \\mathcal{Q}\\rangle_{F|m}\\geq\n0$, where $\\Delta H(\\rho_m, \\rho)$ is the change in the cross entropy between\nthe original phase-space probability distribution $\\rho$ and the\nmeasurement-updated distribution $\\rho_m$, and $\\langle\n\\mathcal{Q}\\rangle_{F|m}$ is the expectation value of a generalized heat flow\nout of the system. We also derive refined versions of the Second Law that bound\nthe entropy increase from below by a non-negative number, as well as Bayesian\nversions of the Jarzynski equality. We demonstrate the formalism using simple\nanalytical and numerical examples.\n", "  We revisit the classical but as yet unresolved problem of predicting the\nbreaking onset of 2D and 3D irrotational gravity water waves. This study\nfocuses on domains with flat bottom topography and conditions ranging from deep\nto intermediate depth (depth to wavelength ratio from 1 to 0.2). Our\ncalculations based on a fully nonlinear boundary element model investigated\ngeometric, kinematic and energetic differences between maximally recurrent and\nmarginally breaking waves in focusing wave groups. Maximally steep non-breaking\n(maximally recurrent) waves are clearly separated from marginally breaking\nwaves by their normalised energy fluxes localized near the crest region. On the\nsurface, this reduces to the local ratio of the energy flux velocity (here the\nfluid velocity) to the crest point velocity for the tallest wave in the\nevolving group. This provides a robust threshold parameter for breaking onset\nfor 2D and 3D wave packets propagating in uniform water depths from deep to\nintermediate. Warning of imminent breaking onset was found to be detected up to\na fifth of a carrier wave period prior to a breaking event.\n", "  Few-layer black phosphorus was recently rediscovered as a narrow-bandgap\natomically thin semiconductor and has already attracted unprecedented attention\ndue to its interesting properties. One feature of this material that sets it\napart from other atomically thin crystals is its structural in-plane anisotropy\nwhich manifests in strongly anisotropic transport characteristics. However,\ntraditional angle-resolved conductance measurements present a challenge for\nnanoscale systems such as black phosphorus, calling for new approaches in\nprecision studies of transport anisotropy. Here we show that the nonlocal\nresponse, being exponentially sensitive to the anisotropy value, provides a\npowerful tool for determining the anisotropy. This is established by combining\nmeasurements of the orientation-dependent nonlocal resistance response with the\nanalysis based on the anamorphosis relations. We demonstrate that the nonlocal\nresponse can differ by orders of magnitude for different crystallographic\ndirections even when the anisotropy is at most order-one, allowing us to\nextract accurate anisotropy values.\n", "  A detailed study of pseudorapidity densities and multiplicity distributions\nof primary charged particles produced in proton-proton collisions, at $\\sqrt{s}\n=$ 0.9, 2.36, 2.76, 7 and 8 TeV, in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta|<2$, was\ncarried out using the ALICE detector. Measurements were obtained for three\nevent classes: inelastic, non-single diffractive and events with at least one\ncharged particle in the pseudorapidity interval $|\\eta|<1$. The use of an\nimproved track-counting algorithm combined with ALICE's measurements of\ndiffractive processes allows a higher precision compared to our previous\npublications. A KNO scaling study was performed in the pseudorapidity intervals\n$|\\eta|<$ 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5. The data are compared to other experimental results\nand to models as implemented in Monte Carlo event generators PHOJET and recent\ntunes of PYTHIA6, PYTHIA8 and EPOS.\n", "  We consider the Forrester-Baxter RSOS lattice models with crossing parameter\n$\\lambda=(m'\\!-\\!m)\\pi/m'$ in Regime~III. In the continuum scaling limit, these\nmodels are described by the minimal models ${\\cal M}(m,m')$. We conjecture\nthat, for $\\lambda<\\pi/n$, the $n\\times n$ fused RSOS models with $n\\ge 2$ are\ndescribed by the higher-level coset $(A^{(1)}_1)_k\\otimes\n(A^{(1)}_1)_n/(A^{(1)}_1)_{k+n}$ at fractional level $k=nM/(M'\\!-\\!M)-2$ with\n$(M,M')=\\big(nm-(n\\!-\\!1)m',m'\\big)$. To support this conjecture, we\ninvestigate the one-dimensional sums arising from Baxter's off-critical corner\ntransfer matrices. In unitary cases ($m=m'\\!-\\!1$) it is known that, up to\nleading powers of $q$, these coincide with the branching functions\n$b_{r,s,\\ell}^{m'\\!-n,m'\\!,n}(q)$. For general nonunitary cases ($m<m'\\!-\\!1$),\nwe identify the ground state one-dimensional RSOS paths and relate them to the\nquantum numbers $(r,s,\\ell)$ in the various sectors. For $n=1,2,3$, we obtain\nthe local energy functions $H(a,b,c)$ in a suitable gauge and verify that the\nassociated one-dimensional sums produce finitized forms that converge, as $N$\nbecomes large, to the fractional level branching functions\n$b_{r,s,\\ell}^{M,M'\\!,n}(q)$. Extending the work of Schilling, we also\nconjecture finitized bosonic branching functions\n$b_{r,s,\\ell}^{M,M'\\!,n;(N)}(q)$ for general $n$ and check that these agree\nwith the one-dimensional sums for $n=1,2,3$ out to system sizes $N=14$. Lastly,\nthe finitized Kac characters $\\chi_{r,s,\\ell}^{P,P'\\!,n;(N)}(q)$ of the\n$n\\times n$ fused logarithmic minimal models ${\\cal LM}(p,p')$ are obtained by\ntaking the {\\em logarithmic limit\\/} $m,m'\\to\\infty$ with $m/m'\\to p/p'+$.\n", "  In the past decades, several detector technologies have been developed with\nthe quest to directly detect dark matter interactions and to test one of the\nmost important unsolved questions in modern physics. The sensitivity of these\nexperiments has improved with a tremendous speed due to a constant development\nof the detectors and analysis methods, proving uniquely suited devices to solve\nthe dark matter puzzle, as all other discovery strategies can only indirectly\ninfer its existence. Despite the overwhelming evidence for dark matter from\ncosmological indications at small and large scales, a clear evidence for a\nparticle explaining these observations remains absent. This review summarises\nthe status of direct dark matter searches, focussing on the detector\ntechnologies used to directly detect a dark matter particle producing recoil\nenergies in the keV energy scale. The phenomenological signal expectations,\nmain background sources, statistical treatment of data and calibration\nstrategies are discussed.\n", "  We respond to a paper of Flambaum, et.al. [Phys. Rev. D95, no. 5, 058701\n(2017)], claiming there is no effective induced oscillating electric dipole\nmoment, e.g., for the electron, arising from interaction with an oscillating\ncosmic axion background via the anomaly. The relevant Feynman amplitude,\nFig.(1), as computed by Flambaum et.al., becomes a total divergence, and\nvanishes. Contrary to this result, we obtained a nonvanishing amplitude, that\nyields physical electric dipole radiation for an electron (or any magnetic\ndipole moment) immersed in a cosmic axion field. We argue that the Flambaum\net.al. counter-claim is incorrect, and is based upon a misunderstanding of a\nphysics choice vs. gauge choice, and an assumption that electric dipoles be\ndefined only by coupling to static (constant in time) electric fields.\n", "  In this work, we study the geodesic structure for a geometry described by a\nspherically symmetric four-dimensional solution embedded in a five-dimensional\nspace known as a brane-based spherically symmetric solution. Mainly, we have\nfound that the extra dimension contributes to the existence of bounded orbits\nfor the photons, such as planetary and circular stable orbits that have not\nbeen observed for other geometries.\n", "  As we are entering the era of precision cosmology, it is necessary to count\non accurate cosmological predictions from any proposed model of dark matter. In\nthis paper we present a novel approach to the cosmological evolution of scalar\nfields that eases their analytic and numerical analysis at the background and\nat the linear order of perturbations. We apply the method to a scalar field\nendowed with a quadratic potential and revisit its properties as dark matter.\nSome of the results known in the literature are recovered, and a better\nunderstanding of the physical properties of the model is provided. It is shown\nthat the Jeans wavenumber defined as $k_J = a \\sqrt{mH}$ is directly related to\nthe suppression of linear perturbations at wavenumbers $k>k_J$. We also discuss\nsome semi-analytical results that are well satisfied by the full numerical\nsolutions obtained from an amended version of the CMB code CLASS. Finally we\ndraw some of the implications that this new treatment of the equations of\nmotion may have in the prediction for cosmological observables.\n", "  We consider the Gross-Pitaevskii(GP) model of a Bose-Einstein Condensate(BEC)\nwith non-local s-wave interactions. The non-locality is represented by\ncorrections to the local GP equation. Due to such corrections to the GP\nequation, there arise corrections to the free energy functional as well. We\npresent here a proof of the exact correspondence between the free energy and\nthe dynamics for typical terms appearing while considering corrections to the\nGP equation at any order. This non-trivial correspondence can be used to study\nBECs perturbatively while going beyond the Fermi pseudopotential.\n", "  Nonlinear higher-spin equations in four dimensions admit a closed two-form\nthat defines a gauge-invariant global charge as an integral over a\ntwo-dimensional cycle. In this paper we argue that this charge gives rise to\npartitions depending on various lower- and higher-spin chemical potentials\nidentified with modules of topological fields in the theory. The vacuum\ncontribution to the partition is calculated to the first nontrivial order for a\nsolution to higher-spin equations that generalizes AdS4 Kerr black hole of\nGeneral Relativity. The resulting partition is non-zero being in parametric\nagreement with the ADM-like behavior of a rotating source. The linear response\nof chemical potentials to the partition function is also extracted. The\nexplicit unfolded form of 4d GR black holes is given. An explicit formula\nrelating asymptotic higher-spin charges expressed in terms of the generalized\nhigher-spin Weyl tensor with those expressed in terms of Fronsdal fields is\nobtained.\n", "  We consider general logarithmic minimal models ${\\cal LM}(p,p')$, with $p,p'$\ncoprime, on a strip of $N$ columns with the $(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions\nintroduced by Pearce, Rasmussen and Tipunin. The associated conformal boundary\nconditions are labelled by the Kac labels $r\\in{\\Bbb Z}$ and $s\\in{\\Bbb N}$.\nThe Robin vacuum boundary condition, labelled by\n$(r,s\\!-\\!\\frac{1}{2})=(0,\\mbox{$\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}$})$, is given as a\nlinear combination of Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The general\n$(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions are constructed, using fusion, by acting on\nthe Robin vacuum boundary with an $(r,s)$-type seam consisting of an $r$-type\nseam of width $w$ columns and an $s$-type seam of width $d=s-1$ columns. The\n$r$-type seam admits an arbitrary boundary field which we fix to the special\nvalue $\\xi=-\\tfrac{\\lambda}{2}$ where $\\lambda=\\frac{(p'-p)\\pi}{2p'}$ is the\ncrossing parameter. The $s$-type boundary introduces $d$ defects into the bulk.\nWe consider the associated quantum Hamiltonians and calculate analytically the\nboundary free energies of the $(r,s)$ Robin boundary conditions. Using\nfinite-size corrections and sequence extrapolation out to system sizes\n$N+w+d\\le 26$, the conformal spectrum of boundary operators is accessible by\nnumerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonians. Fixing the parity of $N$ for\n$r\\ne 0$ and restricting to the ground state sequences\n$w=\\big\\lfloor\\frac{|r|p'}{p}\\big\\rfloor$, $r\\in{\\Bbb Z}$ with the inverse\n$r=(-1)^{N+w+d}\\big\\lceil \\frac{p w}{p'}\\big\\rceil$, we find that the conformal\nweights take the values $\\Delta^{p,p'}_{r,s-\\frac12}$ where\n$\\Delta^{p,p'}_{r,s}$ is given by the usual Kac formula. The $(r,s)$ Robin\nboundary conditions are thus conjugate to scaling operators with half-integer\nvalues for the Kac label $s-\\mbox{$\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}$}$.\n", "  The Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System (MIDAS) atomic force microscope (AFM)\nonboard the Rosetta orbiter was the first such instrument launched into space\nin 2004. Designed only a few years after the technique was invented, MIDAS is\ncurrently orbiting comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko and producing the highest\nresolution 3D images of cometary dust ever made in situ. After more than a year\nof continuous operation much experience has been gained with this novel\ninstrument. Coupled with operations of the Flight Spare and advances in\nterrestrial AFM a set of \"lessons learned\" has been produced, cumulating in\nrecommendations for future spaceborne atomic force microscopes. The majority of\nthe design could be reused as-is, or with incremental upgrades to include more\nmodern components (e.g. the processor). Key additional recommendations are to\nincorporate an optical microscope to aid the search for particles and image\nregistration, to include a variety of cantilevers (with different spring\nconstants) and a variety of tip geometries.\n", "  Crowds can often make better decisions than individuals or small groups of\nexperts by leveraging their ability to aggregate diverse information. Question\nanswering sites, such as Stack Exchange, rely on the \"wisdom of crowds\" effect\nto identify the best answers to questions asked by users. We analyze data from\n250 communities on the Stack Exchange network to pinpoint factors affecting\nwhich answers are chosen as the best answers. Our results suggest that, rather\nthan evaluate all available answers to a question, users rely on simple\ncognitive heuristics to choose an answer to vote for or accept. These cognitive\nheuristics are linked to an answer's salience, such as the order in which it is\nlisted and how much screen space it occupies. While askers appear to depend\nmore on heuristics, compared to voting users, when choosing an answer to accept\nas the most helpful one, voters use acceptance itself as a heuristic: they are\nmore likely to choose the answer after it is accepted than before that very\nsame answer was accepted. These heuristics become more important in explaining\nand predicting behavior as the number of available answers increases. Our\nfindings suggest that crowd judgments may become less reliable as the number of\nanswers grow.\n", "  Sediment transport occurs when the nondimensional fluid shear stress $\\Theta$\nat the bed surface exceeds a minimum value $\\Theta_c$. A large collection of\ndata, known as the Shields curve, shows that $\\Theta_c$ is primarily a function\nof the shear Reynolds number ${\\rm{Re}}_*$. It is commonly assumed that\n$\\Theta>\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ occurs when the ${\\rm Re}_*$-dependent fluid\nforces are too large to maintain static equilibrium for a typical surface\ngrain. A complimentary approach, which remains relatively unexplored, is to\nidentify $\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ as the applied shear stress at which grains\ncannot stop moving. With respect to grain dynamics, ${\\rm{Re}}_*$ can be viewed\nas the viscous time scale for a grain to equilibrate to the fluid flow divided\nby the typical time for the fluid force to accelerate a grain over the\ncharacteristic bed roughness. We performed simulations of granular beds sheared\nby a model fluid, varying only these two time scales. We find that the critical\nShields number $\\Theta_c({\\rm Re}_*)$ obtained from the model mimics the\nShields curve and is insensitive to the grain properties, the model fluid flow,\nand the form of the drag law. Quantitative discrepancies between the model\nresults and the Shields curve are consistent with previous calculations of lift\nforces at varying ${\\rm Re}_*$. Grains at low ${\\rm Re}_*$ find more stable\nconfigurations than those at high ${\\rm{Re}}_*$ due to differences in the grain\nreorganization dynamics. Thus, instead of focusing on mechanical equilibrium of\na typical grain at the bed surface, $\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ may be better\ndescribed by the stress at which mobile grains cannot find a stable\nconfiguration and stop moving.\n", "  In this paper we prove that no absolutely maximally entangled, AME, state\nwith minimal support exists with 7 sites and 5 levels.\n  General AME states are pure multipartite states that, when reduced to half or\nless of the sites, the maximum entropy mixed state is obtained. They have found\napplications in teleportation and quantum secret sharing, and finding\nconditions for their existence is a well known open problem. We consider the\nversion of this problem for minimally supported AME states. We single out known\nboth sufficient and necessary conditions in that case. From our negative\nresult, we show that the necessary condition is not sufficient. The proof uses\na recent result on the theory of general, nonlinear, classical codes.\n", "  Physical Research Laboratory operates a 50cm robotic observatory at Mount\nAbu. This Automated Telescope for Variability Studies (ATVS) makes use of\nRemote Telescope System 2 (RTS2) for autonomous operations. The observatory\nuses a 3.5m dome from Sirius Observatories. We have developed electronics using\nArduino electronic circuit boards with home grown logic and software to control\nthe dome operations. We are in the process of completing the drivers to link\nour Arduino based dome controller with RTS2. This document is a short\ndescription of the various phases of the development and their integration to\nachieve the required objective.\n", "  The technique of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), which allows\nefficient and selective population transfer between quantum states without\nsuffering loss due to spontaneous emission, was introduced in 1990 (Gaubatz\n\\emph{et al.}, J. Chem. Phys. \\textbf{92}, 5363, 1990). Since then STIRAP has\nemerged as an enabling methodology with widespread successful applications in\nmany fields of physics, chemistry and beyond. This article reviews the many\napplications of STIRAP emphasizing the developments since 2000, the time when\nthe last major review on the topic was written (Vitanov \\emph{et al.}, Adv. At.\nMol. Opt. Phys. \\textbf{46}, 55, 2001). A brief introduction into the theory of\nSTIRAP and the early applications for population transfer within three-level\nsystems is followed by the discussion of several extensions to multi-level\nsystems, including multistate chains and tripod systems. The main emphasis is\non the wide range of applications in atomic and molecular physics (including\natom optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, formation of ultracold molecules,\nprecision experiments, etc.), quantum information (including single- and\ntwo-qubit gates, entangled-state preparation, etc.), solid-state physics\n(including processes in doped crystals, nitrogen-vacancy centers,\nsuperconducting circuits, etc.), and even some applications in classical\nphysics (including waveguide optics, frequency conversion, polarization optics,\netc.). Promising new prospects for STIRAP are also presented (including\nprocesses in optomechanics, detection of parity violation in molecules,\nspectroscopy of core-nonpenetrating Rydberg states, and population transfer\nwith X-ray pulses).\n", "  In this work, we interpret the 3-3-1-1 model when the B-L and 3-3-1 breaking\nscales behave simultaneously as the inflation scale. This setup not only\nrealizes the previously-achieved consequences of inflation and leptogenesis,\nbut also provides new insights in superheavy dark matter and neutrino masses.\nWe argue that the 3-3-1-1 model can incorporate a scalar sextet, which induces\nboth small masses for the neutrinos via a combined type I and II seesaw and\nlarge masses for the new neutral fermions. Additionally, all the new particles\nhave the large masses in the inflation scale. The lightest particle among the\nW-particles that have abnormal (i.e., wrong) B-L number in comparison to those\nof the standard model particles may be a superheavy dark matter as it is\nstabilized by the W-parity. The dark matter candidate may be a Majorana\nfermion, a neutral scalar, or a neutral gauge boson, which was properly created\nin the early universe due to the gravitational effects on the vacuum or the\nthermal production after cosmic inflation.\n", "  Leading approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation dedicate a\nsignificant portion of the hardware to computational factories that churn out\nhigh-fidelity ancillas called magic states. Consequently, efficient and\nrealistic factory design is of paramount importance. Here we present the most\ndetailed resource assessment to date of magic state factories within a surface\ncode quantum computer, along the way introducing a number of new techniques. We\nshow that the block codes of Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052329 (2012)]\nhave been systematically undervalued; we track correlated errors both\nnumerically and analytically, providing fidelity estimates without appeal to\nthe union bound. We also introduce a subsystem code realisation of these\nprotocols with constant time and low ancilla cost. Additionally, we confirm\nthat magic state factories have space-time costs that scale as a constant\nfactor of surface code costs. We find that the magic state factory required for\npost-classical factoring can be as small as 6.3 million data qubits, ignoring\nancilla qubits, assuming $10^{-4}$ error gates, and the availability of long\nrange interactions.\n", "  We investigate the effect of spatial disorder on the edge states localized at\nthe interface between two topologically different regions. Rotation disorder\ncan localize the quantum walk if it is strong enough to change the topology,\notherwise the edge state is protected. Nonlinear spatial disorder, dependent on\nthe walker's state, attracts the walk to the interface even for very large\ncoupling, preserving the ballistic transport characteristic of the clean\nregime.\n", "  The cross section for Higgs boson production in pp collisions is studied\nusing the H to WW decay mode, followed by leptonic decays of the W bosons to an\noppositely charged electron-muon pair in the final state. The measurements are\nperformed using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n19.4 inverse femtobarns. The Higgs boson transverse momentum (pT) is\nreconstructed using the lepton pair pT and missing pT. The differential cross\nsection times branching fraction is measured as a function of the Higgs boson\npT in a fiducial phase space defined to match the experimental acceptance in\nterms of the lepton kinematics and event topology. The production cross section\ntimes branching fraction in the fiducial phase space is measured to be 39 +/- 8\n(stat) +/- 9 (syst) fb. The measurements are found to agree, within\nexperimental uncertainties, with theoretical calculations based on the standard\nmodel.\n", "  We study the linearized transport of transverse momentum and charge in a\nconjectured field theory dual to a black brane solution of Horava gravity with\nLifshitz exponent $z=1$. As expected from general hydrodynamic reasoning, we\nfind that both of these quantities are diffusive over distance and time scales\nlarger than the inverse temperature. We compute the diffusion constants and\nconductivities of transverse momentum and charge, as well the ratio of shear\nviscosity to entropy density, and find that they differ from their relativistic\ncounterparts. To derive these results, we propose how the holographic\ndictionary should be modified to deal with the multiple horizons and differing\npropagation speeds of bulk excitations in Horava gravity. When possible, as a\ncheck on our methods and results, we use the covariant Einstein-Aether\nformulation of Horava gravity, along with field redefinitions, to re-derive our\nresults from a relativistic bulk theory.\n", "  Time periodic forcing in the form of coherent radiation is a standard tool\nfor the coherent manipulation of small quantum systems like single atoms. In\nthe last years, periodic driving has more and more also been considered as a\nmeans for the coherent control of many-body systems. In particular, experiments\nwith ultracold quantum gases in optical lattices subjected to periodic driving\nin the lower kilohertz regime have attracted a lot of attention. Milestones\ninclude the observation of dynamic localization, the dynamic control of the\nquantum phase transition between a bosonic superfluid and a Mott insulator, as\nwell as the dynamic creation of strong artificial magnetic fields and\ntopological band structures. This article reviews these recent experiments and\ntheir theoretical description. Moreover, fundamental properties of periodically\ndriven many-body systems are discussed within the framework of Floquet theory,\nincluding heating, relaxation dynamics, anomalous topological edge states, and\nthe response to slow parameter variations.\n", "  We propose a novel strategy to constrain the bottom and charm Yukawa\ncouplings by exploiting LHC measurements of transverse momentum distributions\nin Higgs production. Our method does not rely on the reconstruction of\nexclusive final states or heavy-flavour tagging. Compared to other proposals it\nleads to an enhanced sensitivity to the Yukawa couplings due to distortions of\nthe differential Higgs spectra from emissions which either probe quark loops or\nare associated to quark-initiated production. We derive constraints using data\nfrom LHC Run I, and we explore the prospects of our method at future LHC runs.\nFinally, we comment on the possibility of bounding the strange Yukawa coupling.\n", "  The quantum-to-classical transition through decoherence is a major facet of\nthe semi-classical analysis of quantum models that are supposed to admit a\nclassical regime, as quantum gravity should be. A particular problem of\ninterest is the decoherence of black hole horizons and holographic screens\ninduced by the bulk-boundary coupling with interior degrees of freedom. Here in\nthis paper we present a first toy-model, in the context of loop quantum\ngravity, for the dynamics of a surface geometry as an open quantum system at\nfixed total area. We discuss the resulting decoherence and recoherence and\ncompare the exact density matrix evolution to the commonly used master equation\napproximation {\\it \\`a la} Lindblad underlining its merits and limitations. The\nprospect of this study is to have a clearer understanding of the boundary\ndecoherence of black hole horizons seen by outside observers.\n", "  In a wide class of potentials the exact asymptotic dependence on finite\ndistance R from scattering center is established for outgoing differential\nflux. It is shown how this dependence is eliminated by integration over solid\nangle for total flux, unitarity relation, and optical theorem. Thus, their\napplicability domain extends naturally to the finite R.\n", "  We propose the concept of fermion condensation in bosonic topological orders\nin two spatial dimensions. Fermion condensation can be realized as gapped\ndomain walls between bosonic and fermionic topological orders, which are\nthought of as a real-space phase transitions from bosonic to fermionic\ntopological orders. This generalizes the previous idea of understanding boson\ncondensation as gapped domain walls between bosonic topological orders. We show\nthat generic fermion condensation obeys a Hierarchy Principle by which it can\nbe decomposed into a boson condensation followed by a minimal fermion\ncondensation, which involves a single self-fermion that is its own\nanti-particle and has unit quantum dimension. We then develop the rules of\nminimal fermion condensation, which together with the known rules of boson\ncondensation, provides a full set of rules of fermion condensation. Our studies\npoint to an exact mapping between the Hilbert spaces of a bosonic topological\norder and a fermionic topological order that share a gapped domain wall.\n", "  We study the sound perturbation of a rotating acoustic black hole in the\npresence of a disclination. The radial part of the massless Klein-Gordon\nequation is written into a Heun form, and its analytical solution is obtained.\nThese solutions have an explicit dependence on the parameter of the\ndisclination. We obtain the exact Hawking-Unruh radiation spectrum.\n", "  Many theories of dark matter (DM) predict that DM particles can be captured\nby stars via scattering on ordinary matter. They subsequently condense into a\nDM core close to the center of the star and eventually annihilate. In this\nwork, we trace DM capture and annihilation rates throughout the life of a\nmassive star and show that this evolution culminates in an intense annihilation\nburst coincident with the death of the star in a core collapse supernova. The\nreason is that, along with the stellar interior, also its DM core heats up and\ncontracts, so that the DM density increases rapidly during the final stages of\nstellar evolution. We argue that, counterintuitively, the annihilation burst is\nmore intense if DM annihilation is a $p$-wave process than for $s$-wave\nannihilation because in the former case, more DM particles survive until the\nsupernova. If among the DM annihilation products are particles like dark\nphotons that can escape the exploding star and decay to Standard Model\nparticles later, the annihilation burst results in a flash of gamma rays\naccompanying the supernova. For a galactic supernova, this \"dark gamma ray\nburst\" may be observable in CTA.\n", "  Autonomous neural systems must efficiently process information in a wide\nrange of novel environments, which may have very different statistical\nproperties. We consider the problem of how to optimally distribute receptors\nalong a one-dimensional continuum consistent with the following design\nprinciples. First, neural representations of the world should obey a neural\nuncertainty principle---making as few assumptions as possible about the\nstatistical structure of the world. Second, neural representations should\nconvey, as much as possible, equivalent information about environments with\ndifferent statistics. The results of these arguments resemble the structure of\nthe visual system and provide a natural explanation of the behavioral\nWeber-Fechner law, a foundational result in psychology. Because the derivation\nis extremely general, this suggests that similar scaling relationships should\nbe observed not only in sensory continua, but also in neural representations of\n``cognitive' one-dimensional quantities such as time or numerosity.\n", "  Strongly interacting electrons can move in a neatly coordinated way,\nreminiscent of the movement of viscous fluids. Here we show that in viscous\nflows interactions facilitate transport, allowing conductance to exceed the\nfundamental Landauer's ballistic limit $G_{\\rm ball}$. The effect is\nparticularly striking for the flow through a viscous point contact, a\nconstriction exhibiting the quantum-mechanical ballistic transport at $T=0$ but\ngoverned by electron hydrodynamics at elevated temperatures. We develop a\ntheory of the ballistic-to-viscous crossover using an approach based on\nquasi-hydrodynamic variables. Conductance is found to obey an additive relation\n$G=G_{\\rm ball}+G_{\\rm vis}$, where the viscous contribution $G_{\\rm vis}$\ndominates over $G_{\\rm ball}$ in the hydrodynamic limit. We argue that\nsuperballistic, low-dissipation transport is a generic feature of viscous\nelectronics.\n", "  We report the elliptically, close to circularly polarized lasing at\n$\\hbar\\omega = 1.473$ and 1.522 eV from an AlAs/AlGaAs Bragg microcavity with\n12 GaAs quantum wells in the active region and chiral-etched upper distributed\nBragg refractor under optical pump at room temperature. The advantage of using\nthe chiral photonic crystal with a large contrast of dielectric permittivities\nis its giant optical activity, allowing to fabricate a very thin half-wave\nplate, with a thickness of the order of the emitted light wavelength, and to\nrealize the monolithic control of circular polarization.\n", "  We perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the expected constraints on the\nEpoch of Reionization (EoR) model parameters (i.e., minimum virial temperature,\nthe ionizing efficiency and the mean free path of ionizing photons) taking into\naccount the thermal noise of the exisitting telescopes, MWA and LOFAR. We\nconsider how the inclusion of the 21cm bispectrum improves the constraints\ncompared to using the power spectrum alone. Assuming that we perfectly remove\nthe foreground, we found that the bispectrum, which is calculated by the\n21cmFAST code, can constrain the EoR model parameters more tightly than the\npower spectrum since the bispectrum is more sensitive to the EoR model\nparameters than the power spectrum. We also found that degeneracy between the\nEoR model parameters can be broken by combining the bispectrum with the power\nspectrum.\n", "  5d transition-metal-based oxides display emergent phenomena due to the\ncompetition between the relevant energy scales of the correlation, bandwidth,\nand most importantly, the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Starting from the\nprediction of novel oxide topological insulators in bilayer ABO3 (B = 5d\nelements) thin-film grown along the (111) direction, 5d-based perovskites (Pv)\nform a new paradigm in the thin-film community. Here, we reviewed the\nscientific accomplishments in Pv-SrIrO3 thin films, a popular candidate for\nobserving non-trivial topological phenomena. Although the predicted topological\nphenomena are unknown, the Pv-SrIrO3 thin film shows many emergent properties\ndue to the delicate interplay between its various degrees of freedom. These\nobservations provide new physical insight and encourage further research on the\ndesign of new 5d-based heterostructures or superlattices for the observation of\nthe hidden topological quantum phenomena in strong spin-orbit coupled oxides.\n", "  Multivalent particles have the ability to form multiple bonds to a substrate.\nHence, a multivalent interaction can be strong, even if the individual bonds\nare weak. However, much more interestingly, multivalency greatly increases the\nsensitivity of the particle-substrate interaction to external conditions,\nresulting in an ultra-sensitive and highly non-linear dependence of the binding\nstrength on parameters such as temperature, pH or receptor concentration.\n  In this chapter we focus on super-selectivity: the high sensitivity of the\nstrength of multivalent binding to the number of accessible binding sites on\nthe target surface. For example, the docking of a multivalent particle on a\ncell-surface can be very sensitive (super-selective) to the concentration of\nthe receptors to which the multiple ligands can bind.\n  We present a theoretical analysis of systems of multivalent particles and\ndescribe the mechanism by which multivalency leads to super-selectivity. We\nintroduce a simple analytical model that allows us to predict the overall\nstrength of interactions based on physiochemical characteristics of multivalent\nbinders. Finally, we formulate a set of simple design rules for multivalent\ninteractions that yield optimal selectivity.\n", "  A Hamiltonian operator $\\hat H$ is constructed with the property that if the\neigenfunctions obey a suitable boundary condition, then the associated\neigenvalues correspond to the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function.\nThe classical limit of $\\hat H$ is $2xp$, which is consistent with the\nBerry-Keating conjecture. While $\\hat H$ is not Hermitian in the conventional\nsense, ${\\rm i}{\\hat H}$ is ${\\cal PT}$ symmetric with a broken ${\\cal PT}$\nsymmetry, thus allowing for the possibility that all eigenvalues of $\\hat H$\nare real. A heuristic analysis is presented for the construction of the metric\noperator to define an inner-product space, on which the Hamiltonian is\nHermitian. If the analysis presented here can be made rigorous to show that\n${\\hat H}$ is manifestly self-adjoint, then this implies that the Riemann\nhypothesis holds true.\n", "  When the wavefunction of a large quantum system unitarily evolves away from a\nlow-entropy initial state, there is strong circumstantial evidence it develops\n\"branches\": a decomposition into orthogonal components that is\nindistinguishable from the corresponding incoherent mixture with feasible\nobservations. Is this decomposition unique? Must the number of branches\nincrease with time? These questions are hard to answer because there is no\nformal definition of branches, and most intuition is based on toy models with\narbitrarily preferred degrees of freedom. Here, assuming only the tensor\nstructure associated with spatial locality, I show that branch decompositions\nare highly constrained just by the requirement that they exhibit redundant\nlocal records. The set of all redundantly recorded observables induces a\npreferred decomposition into simultaneous eigenstates unless their records are\nhighly extended and delicately overlapping, as exemplified by the Shor\nerror-correcting code. A maximum length scale for records is enough to\nguarantee uniqueness. Speculatively, objective branch decompositions may speed\nup numerical simulations of nonstationary many-body states, illuminate the\nthermalization of closed systems, and demote measurement from fundamental\nprimitive in the quantum formalism.\n", "  The detailed optical properties have been determined for the iron-based\nmaterials $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$, where $A=\\,$Ca, Sr, and Ba, for light polarized in\nthe iron-arsenic ($a-b$) planes over a wide frequency range, above and below\nthe magnetic and structural transitions at $T_N =$ 172, 195, and 138 K,\nrespectively. The real and imaginary parts of the complex conductivity are fit\nsimultaneously using two Drude terms in combination with a series of\noscillators. Above $T_N$, the free-carrier response consists of a weak, narrow\nDrude term, and a strong, broad Drude term, both of which show only a weak\ntemperature dependence. Below $T_N$ there is a slight decrease of the plasma\nfrequency but a dramatic drop in the scattering rate for the narrow Drude term,\nand for the broad Drude term there is a significant decrease in the plasma\nfrequency, while the decrease in the scattering rate, albeit significant, is\nnot as severe. The small values observed for the scattering rates for the\nnarrow Drude term for $T\\ll{T_N}$ may be related to the Dirac cone-like\ndispersion of the electronic bands. Below $T_N$ new features emerge in the\noptical conductivity that are associated with the reconstruction Fermi surface\nand the gapping of bands at $\\Delta_1 \\simeq$ 45 $-$ 80 meV, and $\\Delta_2\n\\simeq$ 110 $-$ 210 meV. The reduction in the spectral weight associated with\nthe free carriers is captured by the gap structure, specifically, the spectral\nweight from the narrow Drude term appears to be transferred into the low-energy\ngap feature, while the missing weight from the broad term shifts to the\nhigh-energy gap.\n", "  Spin waves in the type-III ordered antiferromagnetic state of the frustrated\n$t$-$t'$ Hubbard model on the fcc lattice are calculated to investigate\nfinite-$U$-induced competing interaction and frustration effects on magnetic\nexcitations and instabilities. Particularly strong competing interactions\ngenerated due to interplay of fcc lattice geometry and magnetic order result in\nsignificant spin wave softening. The calculated spin wave dispersion is found\nto be in qualitative agreement with the measured spin wave dispersion in the\npyrite mineral $\\rm Mn S_2$ obtained from inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments. Instabilities to other magnetic orders (type I, type II, spiral,\nnon-collinear), as signalled by spin wave energies turning negative, are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The rare decays of a kaon into a pion and a charged lepton/antilepton pair\nproceed via a flavour changing neutral current and therefore may only be\ninduced beyond tree level in the Standard Model. This natural suppression makes\nthese decays sensitive to the effects of potential New Physics. The CP\nconserving $K\\to\\pi \\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay channels however are dominated by a\nsingle photon exchange; this involves a sizeable long-distance hadronic\ncontribution which represents the current major source of theoretical\nuncertainty. Here we outline our methodology for the computation of the\nlong-distance contributions to these rare decay amplitudes using lattice QCD\nand present the numerical results of the first exploratory studies of these\ndecays in which all but the disconnected diagrams are evaluated. The domain\nwall fermion ensembles of the RBC and UKQCD collaborations are used, with a\npion mass of $M_{\\pi}\\sim 430\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ and a kaon mass of $M_{K}\\sim\n625\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. In particular we determine the form factor, $V(z)$, of the\n$K^+\\to\\pi^+\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay from the lattice at small values of\n$z=q^2/M_{K}^{2}$, obtaining $V(z)=1.37(36),\\, 0.68(39),\\, 0.96(64)$ for the\nthree values of $z=-0.5594(12),\\, -1.0530(34),\\, -1.4653(82)$ respectively.\n", "  Strong coupling between discrete phonon and continuous electron-hole pair\nexcitations can give rise to a pronounced asymmetry in the phonon line shape,\nknown as the Fano resonance. This effect has been observed in a variety of\nsystems, such as stripe-phase nickelates, graphene and high-$T_{c}$\nsuperconductors. Here, we reveal explicit evidence for strong coupling between\nan infrared-active $A_1$ phonon and electronic transitions near the Weyl points\n(Weyl fermions) through the observation of a Fano resonance in the recently\ndiscovered Weyl semimetal TaAs. The resultant asymmetry in the phonon line\nshape, conspicuous at low temperatures, diminishes continuously as the\ntemperature increases. This anomalous behavior originates from the suppression\nof the electronic transitions near the Weyl points due to the decreasing\noccupation of electronic states below the Fermi level ($E_{F}$) with increasing\ntemperature, as well as Pauli blocking caused by thermally excited electrons\nabove $E_{F}$. Our findings not only elucidate the underlying mechanism\ngoverning the tunable Fano resonance, but also open a new route for exploring\nexotic physical phenomena through the properties of phonons in Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We find $n(n-3)/2$-dimensional regions of the space of kinematic invariants,\nwhere all the solutions to the scattering equations (the core of the CHY\nformulation of amplitudes) for $n$ massless particles are real. On these\nregions, the scattering equations are equivalent to the problem of finding\nstationary points of $n-3$ mutually repelling particles on a finite real\ninterval with appropriate boundary conditions. This identification directly\nimplies that for each of the $(n-3)!$ possible orderings of the $n-3$ particles\non the interval, there exists one stable stationary point. Furthermore,\nrestricting to four dimensions, we find that the separation of the solutions\ninto $k\\in \\{2,3,\\ldots ,n-2\\}$ sectors naturally matches that of permutations\nof $n-3$ labels into those with $k-2$ descents. This leads to a physical\nrealization of the combinatorial meaning of the Eulerian numbers.\n", "  This review provides a pedagogic and self-contained introduction to master\nequations and to their representation by path integrals. We discuss analytical\nand numerical methods for the solution of master equations, keeping our focus\non methods that are applicable even when stochastic fluctuations are strong.\nThe reviewed methods include the generating function technique and the Poisson\nrepresentation, as well as novel ways of mapping the forward and backward\nmaster equations onto linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Spectral\nmethods, WKB approximations, and a variational approach have been proposed for\nthe analysis of the PDE obeyed by the generating function. After outlining\nthese methods, we solve the derived PDEs in terms of two path integrals. The\npath integrals provide distinct exact representations of the conditional\nprobability distribution solving the master equations. We exemplify both path\nintegrals in analysing elementary chemical reactions. Furthermore, we review a\nmethod for the approximation of rare event probabilities and derive path\nintegral representations of Fokker-Planck equations. To make our review\naccessible to a broad community, we have used the language of probability\ntheory rather than quantum (field) theory. The probabilistic structures\nunderpinning various technical concepts, such as coherent states, the\nDoi-shift, and normal-ordered observables, are thereby made explicit.\n", "  We observe metastable localized spin configurations with topological charges\nranging from $Q=-3$ to $Q=2$ in a (Pt$_{0.95}$Ir$_{0.05}$)/Fe bilayer on\nPd$(111)$ surface by performing spin dynamics simulations, using a classical\nHamiltonian parametrized by ab initio calculations. We demonstrate that the\nfrustration of the isotropic exchange interactions is responsible for the\ncreation of these various types of skyrmionic structures. The\nDzyaloshinsky--Moriya interaction present due to the breaking of inversion\nsymmetry at the surface energetically favors skyrmions with $Q=-1$, distorts\nthe shape of the other objects, and defines a preferred orientation for them\nwith respect to the underlying lattice.\n", "  Superconductivity that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry (TRS) has\nbeen found, so far, only in a handful of 3D crystals with bulk inversion\nsymmetry. Here we report an observation of spontaneous TRS breaking in a 2D\nsuperconducting system without inversion symmetry: the epitaxial bilayer films\nof bismuth and nickel. The evidence comes from the onset of the polar Kerr\neffect at the superconducting transition in the absence of an external magnetic\nfield, detected by the ultrasensitive loop-less fiber-optic Sagnac\ninterferometer. Because of strong spin-orbit interaction and lack of inversion\nsymmetry in a Bi/Ni bilayer, superconducting pairing cannot be classified as\nsinglet or triplet. We propose a theoretical model where magnetic fluctuations\nin Ni induce superconducting pairing of the dxy = +- idx^2y^2 orbital symmetry\nbetween the electrons in Bi. In this model the order parameter spontaneously\nbreaks the TRS and has a non-zero phase winding number around the Fermi\nsurface, thus making it a rare example of a 2D topological superconductor.\n", "  We perform the first one-point fluctuation analysis of the high-energy\nneutrino sky. This method reveals itself to be especially suited to\ncontemporary neutrino data, as it allows to study the properties of the\nastrophysical components of the high-energy flux detected by the IceCube\ntelescope, even with low statistics and in the absence of point source\ndetection. Besides the veto-passing atmospheric foregrounds, we adopt a simple\nmodel of the high-energy neutrino background by assuming two main\nextra-galactic components: star-forming galaxies and blazars. By leveraging\nmulti-wavelength data from Herschel and Fermi, we predict the spectral and\nanisotropic probability distributions for their expected neutrino counts in\nIceCube. We find that star-forming galaxies are likely to remain a diffuse\nbackground due to the poor angular resolution of IceCube, and we determine an\nupper limit on the number of shower events that can reasonably be associated to\nblazars. We also find that upper limits on the contribution of blazars to the\nmeasured flux are unfavourably affected by the skewness of the blazar flux\ndistribution. One-point event clustering and likelihood analyses of the IceCube\nHESE data suggest that this method has the potential to dramatically improve\nover more conventional model-based analyses, especially for the next generation\nof neutrino telescopes.\n", "  We unveil the relation between the linear Anderson localisation process and\nnonlinear modulation instability. Anderson localised modes are formed in\ncertain temporal intervals due to the random background noise. Such localised\nmodes seed the formation of solitary waves that will appear during the\nmodulation instability process at those preferred intervals. Afterwards,\noptical-event horizon effects between dispersive waves and solitons produce an\nartificial collective acceleration that favours the collision of solitons,\nwhich could eventually lead to a rogue-soliton generation.\n", "  Particle identification is an important feature of the ALICE detector at the\nLHC. In particular, for particle identification via the time-of-flight\ntechnique, the precise determination of the event collision time represents an\nimportant ingredient of the quality of the measurement. In this paper, the\ndifferent methods used for such a measurement in ALICE by means of the T0 and\nthe TOF detectors are reviewed. Efficiencies, resolution and the improvement of\nthe particle identification separation power of the methods used are presented\nfor the different LHC colliding systems (pp , p-Pb and Pb-Pb) during the first\nperiod of data taking of LHC (Run 1).\n", "  There are well-known dark states in the even-qubit Dicke models, which are\nthe products of the two-qubit singlets and a Fock state, where the qubits are\ndecoupled from the photon field. These spin singlets can be used to store\nquantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation,\ndriving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark\nstates is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling\nstrength. We have obtained a novel kind of dark-like states for the multi-qubit\nand multi-photon Rabi models, whose eigenenergies are also constant in the\nwhole coupling regime. Unlike the dark states, the qubits and photon field are\ncoupled in the dark-like states. Furthermore, the photon numbers are bounded\nfrom above commonly at 1, which is different from that for the one-qubit case.\nThe existence conditions of the dark-like states are simpler than exact\nisolated solutions, and may be fine tuned in experiments. While the\nsingle-qubit and multi-photon Rabi model is well-defined only if the photon\nnumber $M\\leq2$ and the coupling strength is below a certain critical value,\nthe dark-like eigenstates for multi-qubit and multiphoton Rabi model still\nexist, regardless of these constraints. In view of these properties of the\ndark-like states, they may find similar applications like \"dark states\" in\nquantum information.\n", "  In this work, we study the quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild and\nSchwarzschild (Anti-) de Sitter black holes by a matrix method. The proposed\nmethod involves discretizing the master field equation and expressing it in\nform of a homogeneous system of linear algebraic equations. The resulting\nhomogeneous matrix equation furnishes a non-standard eigenvalue problem, which\ncan then be solved numerically to obtain the quasinormal frequencies. A key\nfeature of the present approach is that the discretization of the wave function\nand its derivatives are made to be independent of any specific metric through\ncoordinate transformation. In many cases, it can be carried out beforehand\nwhich in turn improves the efficiency and facilitates the numerical\nimplementation. We also analyze the precision and efficiency of the present\nmethod as well as compare the results to those obtained by different\napproaches.\n", "  Starting from the deformed current-counting transition matrix for the open\nboundary ASEP, we prove that with a further deformation, the symmetric\nKoornwinder polynomials for partitions with equal row lengths appear as the\nnormalisation of the twice deformed ground state. We give a matrix product\nconstruction for this ground state and the corresponding symmetric Koornwinder\npolynomials. Based on the form of this construction and numerical evidence, we\nconjecture a relation between the generating function of the cumulants of the\ncurrent, and a certain limit of the symmetric Koornwinder polynomials.\n", "  We study the decay of superflow via thermally activated phase slips in\none-dimensional Bose gases in a shallow optical lattice. By using the Kramers\nformula, we numerically calculate the nucleation rate of a thermally activated\nphase slip for various values of the filling factor and flow velocity in the\nabsence of a harmonic trapping potential. Within the local density\napproximation, we derive a formula connecting the phase-slip nucleation rate\nwith the damping rate of a dipole oscillation of the Bose gas in the presence\nof a harmonic trap. We use the derived formula to directly compare our theory\nwith the recent experiment done by the LENS group [L. Tanzi, et al., Sci. Rep.\n{\\bf 6}, 25965 (2016)]. From the comparison, the observed damping of dipole\noscillations in a weakly correlated and small velocity regime is attributed\ndominantly to thermally activated phase slips rather than quantum phase slips.\n", "  On a foliated manifold equipped with an action of a compact Lie group $G$, we\nstudy a class of almost-coupling Poisson and Dirac structures, in the context\nof deformation theory and the method of averaging.\n", "  We study the quantum diffusion of charge carriers in octagonal tilings. Our\nnumerical results show a power law decay of the wave-packet spreading, $L(t)\n\\propto t^{\\beta}$, characteristic of critical states in quasicrystals at large\ntime $t$. For many energies states are sub-diffusive, i.e. $\\beta < 0.5$, and\nthus conductivity increases when the amount of defects (static defects and/or\ntemperature) increases.\n", "  An ordered state in the spin sector that breaks parity without breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry, i.e., that can be considered as dynamically generated\nspin-orbit coupling, was proposed to explain puzzling observations in a range\nof different systems. Here we derive severe restrictions for such a state that\nfollow from a Ward identity related to spin conservation. It is shown that\n$l=1$ spin-Pomeranchuk instabilities are not possible in non-relativistic\nsystems since the response of spin-current fluctuations is entirely incoherent\nand non-singular. This rules out relativistic spin-orbit coupling as an\nemergent low-energy phenomenon. We illustrate the exotic physical properties of\nthe remaining higher angular momentum analogues of spin-orbit coupling and\nderive a geometric constraint for spin-orbit vectors in lattice systems.\n", "  The W and Z boson production was measured via the muonic decay channel in\nproton-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV at the Large Hadron\nCollider with the ALICE detector. The measurement covers backward ($-4.46 <\ny_{\\rm cms} < -2.96$) and forward ($2.03 < y_{\\rm cms} < 3.53$) rapidity\nregions, corresponding to Pb-going and p-going directions, respectively. The\nZ-boson production cross section, with dimuon invariant mass of\n$60<m_{\\mu\\mu}<120$ GeV/$c^2$ and muon transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}^\\mu$)\nlarger than 20 GeV/$c$, is measured. The production cross section and charge\nasymmetry of muons from W-boson decays with $p_{\\rm T}^\\mu>10$ GeV/$c$ are\ndetermined. The results are compared to theoretical calculations both with and\nwithout including the nuclear modification of the parton distribution\nfunctions. The W-boson production is also studied as a function of the\ncollision centrality: the cross section of muons from W-boson decays is found\nto scale with the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions within\nuncertainties.\n", "  This paper discusses the letter entitled \"Network analysis of the state space\nof discrete dynamical systems\" by A. Shreim et al. [Physical Review Letters,\n98, 198701 (2007)]. We found that some theoretical analyses are wrong and the\nproposed indicators based on two parameters of the state-mapping network cannot\ndiscriminate the dynamical complexity of the discrete dynamical systems\ncomposed of a 1-D Cellular Automata.\n", "  Gauss-Bonnet holographic fluid is a useful theoretical laboratory to study\nthe effects of curvature-squared terms in the dual gravity action on transport\ncoefficients, quasinormal spectra and the analytic structure of thermal\ncorrelators at strong coupling. To understand the behavior and possible\npathologies of the Gauss-Bonnet fluid in $3+1$ dimensions, we compute\n(analytically and non-perturbatively in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling) its\nsecond-order transport coefficients, the retarded two- and three-point\ncorrelation functions of the energy-momentum tensor in the hydrodynamic regime\nas well as the relevant quasinormal spectrum. The Haack-Yarom universal\nrelation among the second-order transport coefficients is violated at second\norder in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. In the zero-viscosity limit, the\nholographic fluid still produces entropy, while the momentum diffusion and the\nsound attenuation are suppressed at all orders in the hydrodynamic expansion.\nBy adding higher-derivative electromagnetic field terms to the action, we also\ncompute corrections to charge diffusion and identify the non-perturbative\nparameter regime in which the charge diffusion constant vanishes.\n", "  In this work we report on the Monte Carlo study performed to understand and\nreproduce experimental measurements of a new plastic \\b{eta}-detector with\ncylindrical geometry. Since energy deposition simulations differ from the\nexperimental measurements for such a geometry, we show how the simulation of\nproduction and transport of optical photons does allow one to obtain the shapes\nof the experimental spectra. Moreover, taking into account the computational\neffort associated with this kind of simulation, we develop a method to convert\nthe simulations of energy deposited into light collected, depending only on the\ninteraction point in the detector. This method represents a useful solution\nwhen extensive simulations have to be done, as in the case of the calculation\nof the response function of the spectrometer in a total absorption {\\gamma}-ray\nspectroscopy analysis.\n", "  The singularity theorem by Hawking and Penrose qualifies Schwarzschild\nblack-holes as geodesic incomplete space-times. Albeit this is a mathematically\nrigorous statement, it requires an operational framework that allows to probe\nthe space-like singularity via a measurement process. Any such framework\nnecessarily has to be based on quantum theory. As a consequence, the notion of\nclassical completeness needs to be adapted to situations where the only\nadequate description is in terms of quantum fields in dynamical space-times. It\nis shown that Schwarzschild black-holes turn out to be complete when probed by\nself-interacting quantum fields in the ground state and in excited states. The\nmeasure for populating quantum fields on hypersurfaces in the vicinity of the\nblack-hole singularity goes to zero towards the singularity. This statement is\nrobust under non-Gaussian deformations of and excitations relative to the\nground state. The clash of completeness cultures as exemplified with black\nholes is discussed.\n", "  We consider massless string scattering amplitudes in a limit where the number\nof external particles becomes very large, while the energy of each particle\nremains small. Using the growth of the volume of the relevant moduli space, and\nby means of independent numerical evidence, we argue that string perturbation\ntheory breaks down in this limit. We discuss some remarkable implications for\nthe information paradox.\n", "  We perform the first numerical simulations of necklaces in a non-Abelian\ngauge theory. Necklaces are composite classical solutions which can be\ninterpreted as monopoles trapped on strings, rather generic structures in a\nGrand Unified Theory. We generate necklaces from random initial conditions,\nmodelling a phase transition in the early Universe, and study the evolution.\nFor all cases, we find that the necklace system shows scaling behaviour similar\nto that of a network of ordinary cosmic strings. Furthermore, our simulations\nindicate that comoving distance between the monopoles or semipoles along the\nstring asymptotes to a constant value at late times. This means that while the\nmonopole-to-string energy density ratio decreases as the inverse of the scale\nfactor, a horizon-size length of string has a large number of monopoles,\nsignificantly affecting the dynamics of string loops. We argue that\ngravitational wave bounds from millisecond pulsar timing on the string tension\nin the Nambu-Goto scenario are greatly relaxed.\n", "  We show that electric currents are induced in inversion asymmetric\nferromagnets if the exchange splitting varies in time after excitation by laser\npulses. We interpret this phenomenon as the magnetic variant of the inverse\nEdelstein effect. Based on \\textit{ab initio} calculations we determine the\nsize of this effect in Co/Pt(111) and Mn/W(001) magnetic bilayer systems and\ninvestigate its dependence on the magnetization direction. The comparison of\nour theoretical results to experiments measuring the THz signal emitted after\nlaser excitation suggests that ultrafast demagnetization in 3$d$ transition\nmetal ferromagnets is dominated by transverse spin fluctuations rather than by\na reduction of the exchange splitting.\n", "  A broadcasting multiple blind signature scheme based on quantum GHZ\nentanglement has been presented recently by Tian et al. It is said that the\nscheme's unconditional security is guaranteed by adopting quantum key\npreparation, quantum encryption algorithm and quantum entanglement. In this\npaper, we prove that each signatory can get the signed message just by an\nintercept-resend attack. Then, we show there still exists some participant\nattacks and external attacks. Specifically, we verify the message sender Alice\ncan impersonate each signatory to sign the message at will, and so is the\nsignature collector Charlie. Also, we demonstrate that the receiver Bob can\nforge the signature successfully, and with respect to the external attacks, the\neavesdropper Eve can modify the signature at random. Besides, we discover Eve\ncan change the signed message at will, and Eve can impersonate Alice as the\nmessage sender without being discovered. In particular, we propose an improved\nscheme based on the original one and show that it is secure against not only\nthe attacks mentioned above but also some collusion attacks.\n", "  We theoretically study the magnetoresistance (MR) of two-dimensional massless\nDirac electrons as found on the surface of three-dimensional topological\ninsulators (3D TIs) that is capped by a ferromagnetic insulator (FI). We\ncalculate charge and spin transport by Kubo and Boltzmann theories, taking into\naccount the ladder-vertex correction and the in-scattering due to normal and\nmagnetic disorder. The induced exchange splitting is found to generate an\nelectric conductivity that depends on the magnetization orientation, but its\nform is very different from both the anisotropic and spin Hall MR. The in-plane\nMR vanishes identically for non-magnetic disorder, while out-of-plane\nmagnetizations cause a large MR ratio. On the other hand, we do find an\nin-plane MR and planar Hall effect in the presence of magnetic disorder aligned\nwith the FI magnetization. Our results may help understand recent transport\nmeasurements on TI|FI systems.\n", "  In dimensions larger than 3 a modified field strength for Rarita-Schwinger\ntype fields is constructed whose components are not constrained by the field\nequations. In supergravity theories the result provides a modified\n(supercovariant) gravitino field strength related by supersymmetry to the\n(supercovariantized) Weyl tensor. In various cases, such as for free\nRarita-Schwinger type gauge fields and for gravitino fields in several\nsupergravity theories, the modified field strength coincides on-shell with the\nusual field strength. A corresponding result for first order derivatives of\nDirac type spinor fields is also presented.\n", "  A review is given of some mathematical contributions, ideas and questions\nconcerning liquid crystals.\n", "  The strongly coupled D1-D5 conformal field theory is a microscopic model of\nblack holes which is expected to have chaotic dynamics. Here, we study the weak\ncoupling limit of the theory where it is integrable rather than chaotic. In\nthis limit, the operators creating microstates of the lowest mass black hole\nare known exactly. We consider the time-ordered two-point function of light\nprobes in these microstates, normalized by the same two-point function in\nvacuum. These correlators display a universal early-time decay followed by\nlate-time sporadic behavior. To find a prescription for temporal\ncoarse-graining of these late fluctuations we appeal to random matrix theory,\nwhere we show that a progressive time-average smooths the spectral form factor\n(a proxy for the 2-point function) in a typical draw of a random matrix. This\ncoarse-grained quantity reproduces the matrix ensemble average to a good\napproximation. Employing this coarse-graining in the D1-D5 system, we find that\nthe early-time decay is followed by a dip, a ramp and a plateau, in remarkable\nqualitative agreement with recent studies of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.\nWe study the timescales involved, comment on similarities and differences\nbetween our integrable model and the chaotic SYK model, and suggest ways to\nextend our results away from the integrable limit.\n", "  In this paper we consider the enumeration of orientable and non-orientable\nchord diagrams. We show that this enumeration is encoded in appropriate\nexpectation values of the $\\beta$-deformed Gaussian and RNA matrix models. We\nevaluate these expectation values by means of the $\\beta$-deformed topological\nrecursion, and - independently - using properties of quantum curves. We show\nthat both these methods provide efficient and systematic algorithms for\ncounting of chord diagrams with a given genus, number of backbones and number\nof chords.\n", "  In this article, the enumeration of partial chord diagrams is discussed via\nmatrix model techniques. In addition to the basic data such as the number of\nbackbones and chords, we also consider the Euler characteristic, the backbone\nspectrum, the boundary point spectrum, and the boundary length spectrum.\nFurthermore, we consider the boundary length and point spectrum that unifies\nthe last two types of spectra. We introduce matrix models that encode\ngenerating functions of partial chord diagrams filtered by each of these\nspectra. Using these matrix models, we derive partial differential equations -\nobtained independently by cut-and-join arguments in an earlier work - for the\ncorresponding generating functions.\n", "  We introduce the boundary length and point spectrum, as a joint\ngeneralization of the boundary length spectrum and boundary point spectrum in\narXiv:1307.0967. We establish by cut-and-join methods that the number of\npartial chord diagrams filtered by the boundary length and point spectrum\nsatisfies a recursion relation, which combined with an initial condition\ndetermines these numbers uniquely. This recursion relation is equivalent to a\nsecond order, non-linear, algebraic partial differential equation for the\ngenerating function of the numbers of partial chord diagrams filtered by the\nboundary length and point spectrum.\n", "  Observed galaxy luminosities (derived from redshifts) hold information on the\nlarge-scale peculiar velocity field in the form of spatially correlated\nscatter, which allows for bounds on bulk flows and the growth rate of matter\ndensity perturbations using large galaxy redshift surveys. We apply this\nluminosity approach to galaxies from the recent SDSS Data Release 13. Our goal\nis twofold. First, we take advantage of the recalibrated photometry to identify\npossible systematic errors relevant to our previous analysis of earlier data.\nSecond, we seek improved constraints on the bulk flow and the normalized growth\nrate f$\\sigma_{8}$ at z ~ 0.1. Our results confirm the robustness of our\nmethod. Bulk flow amplitudes, estimated in two redshift bins with 0.02 <\nz$_{1}$ < 0.07 < z$_{2}$ < 0.22, are generally smaller than in previous\nmeasurements, consistent with both the updated photometry and expectations for\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model. The obtained growth rate, f$\\sigma_{8}$ = 0.48 +/-\n0.16, is larger than, but still compatible with, its previous estimate, and\ncloser to the reference value of Planck. Rather than precision, the importance\nof these results is due to the fact that they follow from an independent method\nthat relies on accurate photometry, which is a top requirement for\nnext-generation photometric catalogs.\n", "  The galaxy cluster Abell~3376 is a nearby (z=0.046) dissociative merging\ncluster surrounded by two prominent radio relics and showing an X-ray\ncomet-like morphology. The merger system is comprised of the subclusters A3376W\n& A3376E. Based on new deep multi-wavelength large-field images and published\nredshifts, we bring new insights about the history of this merger. Despite the\ndifficulty of applying the weak lensing technique at such low redshift, we\nsuccessfully recovered the mass distribution in the cluster field. Moreover,\nwith the application of a two-body model, we have addressed the dynamics of\nthese merging system. We have found the individual masses of\nM_{200}^{W}=3.0_{-1.7}^{+1.3}x10^{14} M_{\\odot} and\nM_{200}^{E}=0.9_{-0.8}^{+0.5}x10^{14} M_{\\odot}. The cometary shaped X-ray\ndistribution shows only one peak spatially coincident with both Eastern BCG and\nthe A3376E mass peak whereas the gas content of A3376W seems to be stripped\nout. Our data allowed us to confirm the existence of a third subcluster located\nat the North, 1147+-62 kpc apart from the neighbour subcluster A3376E and\nhaving a mass M_{200}^{N}=1.4_{-1.0}^{+0.7}x10^{14} M_{\\odot}. From our\ndynamical analysis, we found the merging is taking place very close to the\nplane of the sky, with the merger axis just 10 deg +-11 deg from it. The\napplication of a two-body analysis code showed that the merging cluster is seen\n0.9_{-0.3}^{+0.2} Gyr after the pericentric passage and it is currently going\nto the point of maximum separation between the subclusters.\n", "  Discovery of unexpected properties of the Higgs boson offers an intriguing\nopportunity of shedding light on some of the most profound puzzles in particle\nphysics. The Beyond Standard Model (BSM) decays of the Higgs boson could reveal\nnew physics in a direct manner. Future electron-positron lepton colliders\noperating as Higgs factories, including CEPC, FCC-ee and ILC, with the\nadvantages of a clean collider environment and large statistics, could greatly\nenhance the sensitivity in searching for these BSM decays. In this work, we\nperform a general study of Higgs exotic decays at future $e^+e^-$ lepton\ncolliders, focusing on the Higgs decays with hadronic final states and/or\nmissing energy, which are very challenging for the High-Luminosity program of\nthe Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). We show that with simple selection cuts,\n$O(10^{-3}\\sim10^{-5})$ limits on the Higgs exotic decay branching fractions\ncan be achieved using the leptonic decaying spectator $Z$ boson in the\nassociated production mode $e^+e^-\\rightarrow Z H$. We further discuss the\ninterplay between the detector performance and Higgs exotic decay, and other\npossibilities of exotic decays. Our work is a first step in a comprehensive\nstudy of Higgs exotic decays at future lepton colliders, which is a key\ningredient of Higgs physics that deserves further investigation.\n", "  Graphene consists in a single-layer carbon crystal where 2$p_z$ electrons\ndisplay a linear dispersion relation in the vicinity of the Fermi level,\nconveniently described by a massless Dirac equation in $2+1$ spacetime.\nSpin-orbit effects open a gap in the band structure and offer perspectives for\nthe manipulation of the conducting electrons spin. Ways to manipulate\nspin-orbit couplings in graphene have been generally assessed by proximity\neffects to metals that do not compromise the mobility of the unperturbed system\nand are likely to induce strain in the graphene layer. In this work we explore\nthe $\\rm{U(1)}\\times SU(2)$ gauge fields that result from the uniform\nstretching of a graphene sheet under a perpendicular electric field.\nConsidering such deformations is particularly relevant due to the\ncounter-intuitive enhancement of the Rashba coupling between 30-50% for small\nbond deformations well known from tight-binding and DFT calculations. We report\nthe accessible changes that can be operated in the band structure in the\nvicinity of the K points as a function of the deformation strength and\ndirection.\n", "  Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has been used extensively for exploring\nnanoscale ferro/piezoelectric phenomena over the past two decades. The imaging\nmechanism of PFM is based on the detection of the electromechanical (EM)\nresponse induced by the inverse piezoelectric effect through the cantilever\ndynamics of an atomic force microscopy. However, several non-piezoelectric\neffects can induce additional contributions to the EM response, which often\nlead to a misinterpretation of the measured PFM response. This review aims to\nsummarize the non-piezoelectric origins of the EM response that impair the\ninterpretation of PFM measurements. We primarily discuss two major\nnon-piezoelectric origins, namely, the electrostatic effect and electrochemical\nstrain. Several approaches for differentiating the ferroelectric contribution\nfrom the EM response are also discussed. The review suggests a undamental\nguideline for the proper utilization of the PFM technique, as well as for\nachieving a reasonable interpretation of observed PFM responses.\n", "  We present a detailed derivation of the two sum rules relating the spin\npolarizabilities measured in real, virtual, and doubly-virtual Compton\nscattering. For example, the polarizability $\\delta_{LT}$, accessed in\ninclusive electron scattering, is related to the spin polarizability\n$\\gamma_{E1E1}$ and the slope of generalized polarizabilities\n$P^{(M1,M1)1}-P^{(L1,L1)1}$, measured in, respectively, the real and the\nvirtual Compton scattering. We verify these sum rules in different variants of\nchiral perturbation theory, discuss their empirical verification for the\nproton, and prospect their use in studies of the nucleon spin structure.\n", "  We report that synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) can be efficiently switched\nby spin-orbit torques (SOTs) and the switching scheme does not obey the usual\nSOT switching rule. We show that both the positive and negative spin Hall angle\n(SHA)-like switching can be observed in Pt/SAF structures with only positive\nSHA, depending on the strength of applied in-plane fields. A new switching\nmechanism directly arising from the asymmetric domain expansion is proposed to\nexplain the anomalous switching behaviors. Contrary to the macrospin-based\nswitching model that the SOT switching direction is determined by the sign of\nSHA, the new switching mechanism suggests that the SOT switching direction is\ndominated by the field-modulated domain wall motion and can be reversed even\nwith the same sign of SHA. The new switching mechanism is further confirmed by\nthe domain wall motion measurements. The anomalous switching behaviors provide\nimportant insights for understanding SOT switching mechanisms and also offer\nnovel features for applications.\n", "  Recently we reported on the condensation of cold, electrostatically trapped\ndipolar excitons in GaAs bilayer heterostructure into a new, dense and dark\ncollective phase. Here we analyze and discuss in detail the experimental\nfindings and the emerging evident properties of this collective liquid-like\nphase. We show that the phase transition is characterized by a sharp increase\nof the number of non-emitting dipoles, by a clear contraction of the fluid\nspatial extent into the bottom of the parabolic-like trap, and by spectral\nnarrowing. We extract the total density of the condensed phase which we find to\nbe consistent with the expected density regime of a quantum liquid. We show\nthat there are clear critical temperature and excitation power onsets for the\nphase transition and that as the power further increases above the critical\npower, the strong darkening is reduced down until no clear darkening is\nobserved. At this point another transition appears which we interpret as a\ntransition to a strongly repulsive yet correlated $e$-$h$ plasma. Based on the\nexperimental findings, we suggest that the physical mechanism that may be\nresponsible for the transition is a dynamical final-state stimulation of the\ndipolar excitons to their dark spin states, which have a long lifetime and thus\nsupport the observed sharp increase in density. Further experiments and\nmodeling will hopefully be able to unambiguously identify the physical\nmechanism behind these recent observations.\n", "  The study on the stability of relativistic disks is one of the most important\ncriteria for the characterization of astrophysically relevant galactic or\naccretion disks models. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the stability\nof static axisymmetric relativistic thin disks, by introducing a first-order\nperturbation into the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid. The formalism is\napplied to three particular models built with the aid of the\ndisplace-cut-reflect (DCR) method, and previously considered in literature\n(Ujevic and Letelier, 2004), but modifying the mass criteria, i.e., using the\nKomar mass instead of the total surface mass. Under this conditions, it is\nfound that the total mass values are independent of the parameters of the\nDCR-method, which let us choose the boundary condition for the cutoff radius,\nsuch that it takes the maximum value that allows an appreciable and\nwell-behaved perturbation on the disk. As a general result, we found that the\nKomar mass is more appropriate to define the cutoff radius.\n", "  The Yang-Baxter $\\sigma$-model is an integrable deformation of the principal\nchiral model on a Lie group $G$. The deformation breaks the $G \\times G$\nsymmetry to $U(1)^{\\textrm{rank}(G)} \\times G$. It is known that there exist\nnon-local conserved charges which, together with the unbroken\n$U(1)^{\\textrm{rank}(G)}$ local charges, form a Poisson algebra $\\mathscr\nU_q(\\mathfrak{g})$, which is the semiclassical limit of the quantum group\n$U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$, with $\\mathfrak{g}$ the Lie algebra of $G$. For a general\nLie group $G$ with rank$(G)>1$, we extend the previous result by constructing\nlocal and non-local conserved charges satisfying all the defining relations of\nthe infinite-dimensional Poisson algebra $\\mathscr U_q(L \\mathfrak{g})$, the\nclassical analogue of the quantum loop algebra $U_q(L \\mathfrak{g})$, where $L\n\\mathfrak{g}$ is the loop algebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$. Quite unexpectedly, these\ndefining relations are proved without encountering any ambiguity related to the\nnon-ultralocality of this integrable $\\sigma$-model.\n", "  A general approach is formulated to describe spontaneous surface current\ndistribution in a chiral p-wave superconductor. We use the quasiclassical\nEilenberger formalism in the Ricatti parametrization to describe various types\nof the superconductor surface, including arbitrary roughness and metallic\nbehaviour of the surface layer. We calculate angle resolved distributions of\nthe spontaneous surface currents and formulate the conditions of their\nobservability. We argue that local measurements of these currents by muSR\ntechnique may provide an information on the underlying pairing symmetry in the\nbulk superconductor.\n", "  In this work, we study the outward propagation of temperature perturbations.\nFor this purpose, we apply an advanced analysis technique, the Transfer\nEntropy, to ECE measurements performed in ECR heated discharges at the\nlow-shear stellarator TJ-II. We observe that the propagation of these\nperturbations is not smooth, but is slowed down at specific radial positions,\nnear 'trapping zones' characterized by long time lags with respect to the\nperturbation origin. We also detect instances of rapid or instantaneous\n(non-local) propagation, in which perturbations appear to 'jump over' specific\nradial regions.\n  The analysis of perturbations introduced in a resistive Magneto-Hydrodynamic\nmodel of the plasma leads to similar results. The radial regions corresponding\nto slow radial transport are identified with maxima of the flow shear\nassociated with rational surfaces (mini-transport barriers). The non-local\ninteractions are ascribed to MHD mode coupling effects.\n", "  We consider the spontaneous formation of striped structures in a holographic\nmodel which possesses explicit translational symmetry breaking, dual to an\nionic lattice with spatially modulated chemical potential. We focus on the\nperturbative study of the marginal modes which drive the transition to a phase\nexhibiting spontaneous stripes. We study the wave-vectors of the instabilities\nwith largest critical temperature in a wide range of backgrounds characterized\nby the period and the amplitude of the chemical potential modulation.\n  We report the first holographic observation of the commensurate lock-in\nbetween the spontaneous stripes and the underlying ionic lattice, which takes\nplace when the amplitude of the lattice is large enough. We also observe an\nincommensurate regime in which the amplitude of the lattice is finite, but the\npreferred stripe wave-vector is different from that of the lattice.\n", "  We show that in the presence of a three-dimensional (Weyl) spin-orbit\ncoupling, a transverse spin current is generated in response to either a\nconstant spin-independent force or a time-dependent Zeeman field in an\narbitrary direction. This effect is the non-Abelian counterpart of the\nuniversal intrinsic spin Hall effect characteristic to the two-dimensional\nRashba spin-orbit coupling. We quantify the strength of such an omnidirectional\nspin Hall effect by calculating the corresponding conductivity for fermions and\nnon-condensed bosons. The absence of any kind of disorder in ultracold-atom\nsystems makes the observation of this effect viable.\n", "  We re-examine the possibility of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays being\naccelerated in nearby dormant quasars. We particularize our study to heavy\nnuclei to accommodate the spectrum and nuclear composition recently reported by\nthe Pierre Auger Collaboration. Particle acceleration is driven by the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism, which wires the dormant spinning black holes as\nFaraday unipolar dynamos. We demonstrate that energy losses are dominated by\nphotonuclear interactions on the ambient photon fields. We argue that the local\ndark fossils of the past quasar activity can be classified on the basis of how\nsource parameters (mass of the central engine and photon background surrounding\nthe accelerator) impact the photonuclear interaction. In this classification it\nis possible to distinguish two unequivocal type of sources: those in which\nnuclei are completely photodisintegrated before escaping the acceleration\nregion and those in which photopion production is the major energy damping\nmechanism. We further argue that the secondary nucleons from the\nphotodisintegrated nuclei (which have a steep spectral index at injection) can\npopulate the energy region below \"the ankle\" feature in the cosmic ray\nspectrum, whereas heavy and medium mass nuclei (with a harder spectral index)\npopulate the energy region beyond \"the ankle\", all the way to the high energy\nend of the spectrum. In addition, we show that five potential quasar remnants\nfrom our cosmic backyard correlate with the hot-spot observed by the Telescope\nArray.\n", "  In this paper, the period evolution of the rotating chemically peculiar star\nV473\\,Tau (A0Si, V = 7.26 mag) is investigated. Even though the star has been\nobserved for more than fifty years, for the first time four consecutive years\nof space-based data covering between 2007 and 2010 is presented. The data is\nfrom the {\\sl STEREO} satellite, and is combined with the archival results. The\nanalysis shows that the rotation period of V473\\,Tau is $1.406829(10)$ days,\nand has slightly decreased with the variation rate of -0.11(3)~s~yr$^{-1}$ over\ntime. Also, the acceleration timescale of the star is found to be around\n$-1.11(63) \\times 10^6$~yr, shorter than its main sequence lifetime\n($9.26(1.25) \\times 10^8$~yr). This indicates that the process of decrease in\nperiod might be reversible. On this basis, it can be suggested that V473\\,Tau\nhas a possible magnetic breaking and a differential rotation, which cause a\nvariation in the movement of inertia, and hence the observed period change.\n", "  We prove the Lorentz invariance of the angular momentum conservation law and\nthe helicity sum rule for relativistic composite systems in the light-front\nformulation. We explicitly show that $j^3$, the $z$-component of the angular\nmomentum remains unchanged under Lorentz transformations generated by the\nlight-front kinematical boost operators. The invariance of $j^3$ under Lorentz\ntransformations is a feature unique to the front form. Applying the Lorentz\ninvariance of the angular quantum number in the front form, we obtain a\nselection rule for the orbital angular momentum which can be used to eliminate\ncertain interaction vertices in QED and QCD. We also generalize the selection\nrule to any renormalizable theory and show that there exists an upper bound on\nthe change of orbital angular momentum in scattering processes at any fixed\norder in perturbation theory.\n", "  This short piece celebrates Haldane's seminal J. Phys. C 14, 2585 (1981)\npaper laying the foundations of the modern theory of Luttinger liquids in\none-dimensional systems.\n", "  Advances in time resolved spectroscopy have provided new insight into the\nenergy transmission in natural photosynthetic complexes. Novel theoretical\ntools and models are being developed in order to explain the experimental\nresults. We provide a model calculation for the two-dimensional electronic\nspectra of Cholorobaculum tepidum which correctly describes the main features\nand transfer time scales found in recent experiments. From our calculation one\ncan infer the coupling of the antenna chlorosome with the environment and the\ncoupling between the chlorosome and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. We show\nthat environment assisted transport between the subunits is the required\nmechanism to reproduce the experimental two-dimensional electronic spectra.\n", "  We present a dual-comb spectrometer based on two passively mode-locked\nwaveguide lasers integrated in a single Er-doped ZBLAN chip. This original\ndesign yields two free-running frequency combs having a high level of mutual\nstability. We developed in parallel a self-correction algorithm that\ncompensates residual relative fluctuations and yields mode-resolved spectra\nwithout the help of any reference laser or control system. Fluctuations are\nextracted directly from the interferograms using the concept of ambiguity\nfunction, which leads to a significant simplification of the instrument that\nwill greatly ease its widespread adoption. Comparison with a correction\nalgorithm relying on a single-frequency laser indicates discrepancies of only\n50 attoseconds on optical timings. The capacities of this instrument are\nfinally demonstrated with the acquisition of a high-resolution molecular\nspectrum covering 20 nm. This new chip-based multi-laser platform is ideal for\nthe development of high-repetition-rate, compact and fieldable comb\nspectrometers in the near- and mid-infrared.\n", "  The model that fast radio bursts are caused by plunges of asteroids onto\nneutron stars can explain both repetitive and non-repetitive bursts. If a\nneutron star passes through an asteroid belt around another star, there would\nbe a series of bursts caused by series of asteroid impacts. Moreover, the\nneutron star would cross the same belt repetitively if it is in a binary with\nthe star hosting the asteroid belt, leading to a repeated series of bursts. I\nexplore the properties of neutron star binaries which could lead to the only\nknown repetitive fast radio burst so far (FRB121102). In this model, the next\ntwo epochs of bursts are expected around 27-February-2017 and 18-December-2017.\n  On the other hand, if the asteroid belt is located around the neutron star\nitself, then a chance fall of an asteroid from that belt onto the neutron star\nwould lead to a non-repetitive burst. Even a neutron star grazing an asteroid\nbelt can lead to a non-repetitive burst caused by just one asteroid plunge\nduring the grazing. This is possible even when the neutron star is in a binary\nwith the asteroid hosting star, if the belt and the neutron star orbit are\nnon-coplanar.\n", "  The formation of large voids in the Cosmic Web from the initial adiabatic\ncosmological perturbations of space-time metric, density and velocity of matter\nis investigated in cosmological model with the dynamical dark energy\naccelerating expansion of the Universe. It is shown that the negative density\nperturbations with the initial radius of about 50 Mpc in comoving to the\ncosmological background coordinates and the amplitude corresponding to the\nr.m.s. temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background lead to the\nformation of voids with the density contrast up to $-$0.9, maximal peculiar\nvelocity about 400 km/s and the radius close to the initial one. An important\nfeature of voids formation from the analyzed initial amplitudes and profiles is\nestablishing the surrounding overdensity shell. We have shown that the ratio of\nthe peculiar velocity in units of the Hubble flow to the density contrast in\nthe central part of a void does not depend or weakly depends on the distance\nfrom the center of the void. It is also shown that this ratio is sensitive to\nthe values of dark energy parameters and can be used to find them based on the\nobservational data on mass density and peculiar velocities of galaxies in the\nvoids.\n", "  Light with transverse polarization structure, such as radial and azimuthal\npolarization, enables and revives lots of applications based on light-matter\ninteraction due to their unique focal properties. To date, studies referring to\nthis topic mainly concentrate in weak-light domain, yet it should have gained\nmore attention in strong-light domain. A main factor contributing to the\ncurrent situation is that the generation devices cannot afford high power.\nHere, in this proof-of-principle work, we demonstrate the generation of strong\nsingle-longitudinal-mode (SLM) cylindrical vector (CV) short pulses via\nstimulated Brillouin amplification, specifically, the energy is transferred\nfrom a 700 ps pump to a 300 ps Stokes pulse via parametrically generated\ncoherent phonons. After amplification, a 100 mJ-level SLM CV pulse light with\n300 ps duration is obtained. Meanwhile, the phase and polarization structures\nare high fidelity maintained. This result provides a practicable way to\ngenerate strong CV light, and by extending this mechanism into multi-pump beam\ncombing system, even an ultra-high intensity CV light can be expected.\n", "  In this work, we introduce a definition of the Discrete Fourier Transform\n(DFT) on Euclidean lattices in $\\R^n$, that generalizes the $n$-th fold DFT of\nthe integer lattice $\\Z^n$ to arbitrary lattices. This definition is not\napplicable for every lattice, but can be defined on lattices known as\nSystematic Normal Form (SysNF) introduced in \\cite{ES16}. Systematic Normal\nForm lattices are sets of integer vectors that satisfy a single homogeneous\nmodular equation, which itself satisfies a certain number-theoretic property.\nSuch lattices form a dense set in the space of $n$-dimensional lattices, and\ncan be used to approximate efficiently any lattice. This implies that for every\nlattice $L$ a DFT can be computed efficiently on a lattice near $L$.\n  Our proof of the statement above uses arguments from quantum computing, and\nas an application of our definition we show a quantum algorithm for sampling\nfrom discrete distributions on lattices, that extends our ability to sample\nefficiently from the discrete Gaussian distribution \\cite{GPV08} to any\ndistribution that is sufficiently \"smooth\". We conjecture that studying the\neigenvectors of the newly-defined lattice DFT may provide new insights into the\nstructure of lattices, especially regarding hard computational problems, like\nthe shortest vector problem.\n", "  Among the Milky Way satellites discovered in the past three years, Triangulum\nII has presented the most difficulty in revealing its dynamical status. Kirby\net al. (2015a) identified it as the most dark matter-dominated galaxy known,\nwith a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius of 3600 +3500 -2100\nM_sun/L_sun. On the other hand, Martin et al. (2016) measured an outer velocity\ndispersion that is 3.5 +/- 2.1 times larger than the central velocity\ndispersion, suggesting that the system might not be in equilibrium. From new\nmulti-epoch Keck/DEIMOS measurements of 13 member stars in Triangulum II, we\nconstrain the velocity dispersion to be sigma_v < 3.4 km/s (90% C.L.). Our\nprevious measurement of sigma_v, based on six stars, was inflated by the\npresence of a binary star with variable radial velocity. We find no evidence\nthat the velocity dispersion increases with radius. The stars display a wide\nrange of metallicities, indicating that Triangulum II retained supernova ejecta\nand therefore possesses or once possessed a massive dark matter halo. However,\nthe detection of a metallicity dispersion hinges on the membership of the two\nmost metal-rich stars. The stellar mass is lower than galaxies of similar mean\nstellar metallicity, which might indicate that Triangulum II is either a star\ncluster or a tidally stripped dwarf galaxy. Detailed abundances of one star\nshow heavily depressed neutron-capture abundances, similar to stars in most\nother ultra-faint dwarf galaxies but unlike stars in globular clusters.\n", "  We report the quasirelativistic potential energy curves including spin-orbit\nand scalar-relativistic effects of the NaRb molecule. The calculated curves of\nthe 0$^+$, 0$^-$, 1, and 2 molecular states correlate for large internuclear\nseparation with the five lowest atomic energies covering the first P doublet\nstates of the rubidium and sodium atoms. Several new features of potential\ncurves are found. Some disagreements with the other theoretical data are found\nand discussed. We advocate that our results may be used in the direct way,\nskipping the unperturbation of the spin-orbit interaction, for assigning the\nmolecular spectra.\n", "  Using deep multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies from ZFOURGE, we group\ngalaxies at $2.5<z<4.0$ by the shape of their spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). We identify a population of galaxies with excess emission in the\n$K_s$-band, which corresponds to [OIII]+H$\\beta$ emission at $2.95<z<3.65$.\nThis population includes 78% of the bluest galaxies with UV slopes steeper than\n$\\beta = -2$. We de-redshift and scale this photometry to build two composite\nSEDs, enabling us to measure equivalent widths of these Extreme [OIII]+H$\\beta$\nEmission Line Galaxies (EELGs) at $z\\sim3.5$. We identify 60 galaxies that\ncomprise a composite SED with [OIII]+H$\\beta$ rest-frame equivalent width of\n$803\\pm228$\\AA\\ and another 218 galaxies in a composite SED with equivalent\nwidth of $230\\pm90$\\AA. These EELGs are analogous to the `green peas' found in\nthe SDSS, and are thought to be undergoing their first burst of star formation\ndue to their blue colors ($\\beta < -1.6$), young ages\n($\\log(\\rm{age}/yr)\\sim7.2$), and low dust attenuation values. Their strong\nnebular emission lines and compact sizes (typically $\\sim1.4$ kpc) are\nconsistent with the properties of the star-forming galaxies possibly\nresponsible for reionizing the universe at $z>6$. Many of the EELGs also\nexhibit Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission. Additionally, we find that many of these\nsources are clustered in an overdensity in the Chandra Deep Field South, with\nfive spectroscopically confirmed members at $z=3.474 \\pm 0.004$. The spatial\ndistribution and photometric redshifts of the ZFOURGE population further\nconfirm the overdensity highlighted by the EELGs.\n", "  Two standing-wave single-cell choke-mode damped structures with different\nchoke dimensions which worked at 11.424 GHz were designed, manufactured and\ntuned by accelerator group in Tsinghua University. High power test was carried\nout to study choke-mode structure's properties in high gradient and related\nbreakdown phenomenon. A single-cell structure without choke which almost has\nthe same inner dimension as choke-mode structure was also tested as a\ncomparison to study how the choke affects high-gradient properties. In this\npaper, we report on the latest status of the high power test, including various\nobservations and the experimental results.\n", "  We use the ZFIRE survey (http://zfire.swinburne.edu.au) to investigate the\nhigh mass slope of the initial mass function (IMF) for a mass-complete\n(log10(M$_*$/M$_\\odot$)~9.3) sample of 102 star-forming galaxies at z~2 using\ntheir H$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (H$\\alpha$-EW) and rest-frame optical\ncolours. We compare dust-corrected H$\\alpha$-EW distributions with predictions\nof star-formation histories (SFH) from PEGASE.2 and Starburst99 synthetic\nstellar population models. We find an excess of high H$\\alpha$-EW galaxies that\nare up to 0.3--0.5 dex above the model-predicted Salpeter IMF locus and the\nH$\\alpha$-EW distribution is much broader (10--500 \\AA) than can easily be\nexplained by a simple monotonic SFH with a standard Salpeter-slope IMF. Though\nthis discrepancy is somewhat alleviated when it is assumed that there is no\nrelative attenuation difference between stars and nebular lines, the result is\nrobust against observational biases, and no single IMF (i.e. non-Salpeter\nslope) can reproduce the data. We show using both spectral stacking and Monte\nCarlo simulations that starbursts cannot explain the EW distribution. We\ninvestigate other physical mechanisms including models with variations in\nstellar rotation, binary star evolution, metallicity, and the IMF upper-mass\ncutoff. IMF variations and/or highly rotating extreme metal poor stars\n(Z~0.1Z$_\\odot$) with binary interactions are the most plausible explanations\nfor our data. If the IMF varies, then the highest H$\\alpha$-EWs would require\nvery shallow slopes ($\\Gamma$>-1.0) with no one slope able to reproduce the\ndata. Thus, the IMF would have to vary stochastically. We conclude that the\nstellar populations at z~2 show distinct differences from local populations and\nthere is no simple physical model to explain the large variation in\nH$\\alpha$-EWs at z~2.\n", "  SKA precursors are capable of detecting hundreds of galaxies in HI in a\nsingle 12 hours pointing. In deeper surveys one will probe more easily faint HI\nstructures, typically located in the vicinity of galaxies, such as tails,\nfilaments, and extraplanar gas. The importance of interactive visualization has\nproven to be fundamental for the exploration of such data as it helps users to\nreceive immediate feedback when manipulating the data. We have developed\nSlicerAstro, a 3-D interactive viewer with new analysis capabilities, based on\ntraditional 2-D input/output hardware. These capabilities enhance the data\ninspection, allowing faster analysis of complex sources than with traditional\ntools. SlicerAstro is an open-source extension of 3DSlicer, a multi-platform\nopen source software package for visualization and medical image processing.\n  We demonstrate the capabilities of the current stable binary release of\nSlicerAstro, which offers the following features: i) handling of FITS files and\nastronomical coordinate systems; ii) coupled 2-D/3-D visualization; iii)\ninteractive filtering; iv) interactive 3-D masking; v) and interactive 3-D\nmodeling. In addition, SlicerAstro has been designed with a strong, stable and\nmodular C++ core, and its classes are also accessible via Python scripting,\nallowing great flexibility for user-customized visualization and analysis\ntasks.\n", "  This document is prepared for the LCWS2016 conference proceedings. It reviews\nthe current results on the Higgs CP property measurements from both ATLAS and\nCMS experiments in the Higgs to diboson decays, and in the Vector Boson Fusion\nproduction of Higgs via the ditau decay channel. The projected sensitivity of\nthe ditau signal in HL-LHC is briefly discussed. Finally, it gives the\nprospects for the CP measurement in the Higgs to ditau decay with the tau\nsubstructure developments at both collaborations.\n", "  Analytical functions for the propagators of QCD, including a set of chiral\nquarks, are derived by a one-loop massive expansion in the Landau gauge, and\nare studied in Minkowski space, yielding a direct proof of positivity violation\nand confinement from first principles. Complex conjugated poles are found for\nthe gluon propagator.\n", "  We present an abstract functional analytic formulation of the celebrated\n$\\dive$-$\\curl$ lemma found by F.~Murat and L.~Tartar. The viewpoint in this\nnote relies on sequences for operators in Hilbert spaces. Hence, we draw the\nfunctional analytic relation of the div-curl lemma to differential forms and\nother sequences such as the $\\Grad\\grad$-sequence discovered recently by\nD.~Pauly and W.~Zulehner in connection with the biharmonic operator.\n", "  \"Let us call the novel quantities which, in addition to the vectors and\ntensors, have appeared in the quantum mechanics of the spinning electron, and\nwhich in the case of the Lorentz group are quite differently transformed from\ntensors, as spinors for short. Is there no spinor analysis that every physicist\ncan learn, such as tensor analysis, and with the aid of which all the possible\nspinors can be formed, and secondly, all the invariant equations in which\nspinors occur?\" So Mr Ehrenfest asked me and the answer will be given below.\n", "  Electron heating and mixing during asymmetric reconnection are studied with a\n3D kinetic simulation that matches plasma parameters from Magnetospheric\nMultiscale (MMS) spacecraft observations of a magnetopause diffusion region.\nThe mixing and heating are strongly enhanced across the magnetospheric\nseparatrix compared to a 2D simulation. The transport of particles across the\nseparatrix in 3D is attributed to lower-hybrid drift turbulence excited at the\nsteep density gradient near the magnetopause. In the 3D simulation (and not the\n2D simulation), the electron temperature parallel to the magnetic field within\nthe mixing layer is significantly higher than its upstream value in agreement\nwith the MMS observations.\n", "  Results on the $H\\to\\tau\\tau$ measurements performed by the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations with the pp collision data collected at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}=$7\nand 8 TeV are presented. These include a test of CP invariance in the VBF Higgs\nboson production. Experimental challenges for the test of the CP invariance in\nthe $H\\to\\tau\\tau$ decays are also reviewed.\n", "  Traffic breakdown, as one of the most puzzling traffic flow phenomena, is\ncharacterized by sharply decreasing speed, abruptly increasing density and in\nparticular suddenly plummeting capacity. In order to clarify its root\nmechanisms and model its observed properties, this paper proposes a\ncar-following model based on the following assumptions: (i) There exists a\npreferred time-varied and speed-dependent space gap that cars hope to maintain;\n(ii) there exists a region R restricted by two critical space gaps and two\ncritical speeds in the car following region on the speed-space gap diagram, in\nwhich cars' movements are determined by the weighted mean of the space-\ngap-determined acceleration and the speed-difference-determined acceleration;\nand (iii) out of region R, cars either accelerate to the free flow speed or\ndecelerate to keep safety. Simulation results show that this model is able to\nsimultaneously reproduce traffic breakdown and the transition from the\nsynchronized traffic flow to wide moving jams. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst car-following model that is able to fully depict traffic breakdown,\nspontaneous formation of jams, and the concave growth of the oscillations.\n", "  Various aspects of forward physics have been studied by the ATLAS\ncollaboration using data from Run I at the LHC. In this text, main results of\nthree published analyses are summarized, based on data from proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ or 8 TeV collected between 2010 and 2012. One\nanalysis deals with diffractive signature with at least two jets in the final\nstate, the other two study exclusive production of a pair of leptons or W\nbosons.\n", "  We consider the generic model of a finite-size quantum electron system\nconnected to two (temperature and particle) reservoirs. The quantum open system\nis driven out of equilibrium by the presence of both a temperature and a\nchemical potential differences between the two reservoirs. The nonequilibrium\n(NE) thermodynamical properties of such a quantum open system are studied for\nthe steady state regime. In such a regime, the corresponding NE density matrix\nis built on the so-called generalised Gibbs ensembles. From different\nexpressions of the NE density matrix, we can identify the terms related to the\nentropy production in the system. We show, for a simple model, that the entropy\nproduction rate is always a positive quantity. Alternative expressions for the\nentropy production are also obtained from the Gibbs-von Neumann conventional\nformula and discussed in detail. Our results corroborate and expand earlier\nworks found in the literature.\n", "  A new experimental technique for creating and imaging collisions of\nmicron-sized droplets settling under gravity is presented. A pair of glycerol\ndroplets is suspended in air by means of two optical traps. The droplet\nrelative velocities are determined by the droplet sizes. The impact parameter\nis precisely controlled by positioning the droplets using the two optical\ntraps. The droplets are released by turning off the trapping light using\nelectro-optical modulators. The motion of the sedimenting droplets is then\ncaptured by two synchronized high-speed cameras, at a frame rate of up to 63\nkHz. The method allows the direct imaging of the collision of droplets without\nthe influence of the optical confinement imposed by the trapping force. The\nmethod will facilitate efficient studies of the microphysics of neutral, as\nwell as charged, liquid droplets and their interactions with light, electric\nfield and thermodynamic environment, such as temperature or vapor\nconcentration.\n", "  The paper presents a novel analysis of a transmission problem for a network\nof flexural beams incorporating conventional Euler-Bernoulli beams as well as\nRayleigh beams with the enhanced rotational inertia. Although, in the\nlow-frequency regime, these beams have a similar dynamic response, we have\ndemonstrated novel features which occur in the transmission at higher\nfrequencies across the layer of the Rayleigh beams.\n", "  With the installation of the Argus 16-pixel receiver covering 75-115 GHz on\nthe Green Bank Telescope (GBT), it is now possible to characterize the antenna\nbeam at very high frequencies, where the use of the active surface and\nout-of-focus holography are critical to the telescope's performance. A recent\nmeasurement in good weather conditions (low atmospheric opacity, low winds, and\nstable night-time thermal conditions) at 109.4 GHz yielded a FWHM beam of\n6.7\"x6.4\" in azimuth and elevation, respectively. This corresponds to\n1.16+/-0.03 Lambda/D at 109.4 GHz. The derived ratio agrees well with the\nlow-frequency value of 1.18+/-0.03 Lambda/D measured at 9.0 GHz. There are no\ndetectable side-lobes at either frequency. In good weather conditions and after\napplying the standard antenna corrections (pointing, focus, and the active\nsurface corrections for gravity and thermal effects), there is no measurable\ndegradation of the beam of the GBT at its highest operational frequencies.\n", "  We present an overview of recent developments in charm physics reported in\nthe Working~Group~7 meetings of the CKM 2016 workshop. Progresses in\nexperimental analysis and techniques were reported by LHCb, Belle, BABAR and\nBESIII along with projections for the future. Developments were also reported\nin the phenomenological extraction of both direct and indirect CP violation\nfrom data in two-, three- and four-body hadronic decays of the $D$ mesonic\nsystem.\n", "  Warm forming processes have been successfully applied at laboratory level to\novercome some important drawbacks of the Al-Mg alloys, such as poor formability\nand large springback. However, the numerical simulation of these processes\nrequires the adoption of coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis,\nusing temperature-dependent material models. The numerical description of the\nthermo-mechanical behaviour can require a large set of experimental tests.\nThese experimental tests should be performed under conditions identical to the\nones observed in the forming process. In this study, the warm deep drawing of a\ncylindrical cup is analysed, including the split-ring test to assess the\ntemperature effect on the springback. Based on the analysis of the forming\nprocess conditions, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the AA5086 aluminium\nalloy is described by a rate-independent thermo-elasto-plastic material model.\nThe hardening law adopted is temperature-dependent while the yield function is\ntemperature-independent. Nevertheless, the yield criterion parameters are\nselected based on the temperature of the heated tools. In fact, the model\nassumes that the temperature of the tools is uniform and constant, adopting a\nvariable interfacial heat transfer coefficient. The accuracy of the proposed\nfinite element model is assessed by comparing numerical and experimental\nresults. The predicted punch force, thickness distribution and earing profile\nare in very good agreement with the experimental measurements, when the\nanisotropic behaviour of the blank is accurately described. However, this does\nnot guarantee a correct springback prediction, which is strongly influenced by\nthe elastic properties, namely the Young's modulus.\n", "  In this contribution, Double Parton Scattering processes observed with the\nATLAS detector at LHC are discussed. Results of five analyses are presented:\nproduction of W boson in association with 2 jets, production of J/psi meson in\nassociation with W boson, J/psi production with Z boson, J/psi pair production\nand four jet events.\n", "  The Cosmological Constant $\\Lambda$, in different incarnations, has been with\nus for 100 years. Many surveys of dark energy are underway, indicating so far\nthat the data are consistent with a dark energy equation of state of $w=-1$,\ni.e. a $\\Lambda$ term in Einstein's equation, although time variation of $w$ is\nnot yet ruled out. The ball is now back in the theoreticians' court, to explain\nthe physical meaning of $\\Lambda$. We discuss sociological aspects of this\nfield, in particular to what extent the agreement on the cold dark matter +\n$\\Lambda$ concordance model is a result of the globalization of research and\nover-communication.\n", "  Any interpretation of the astrophysical neutrinos discovered by IceCube must\naccommodate a variety of multimessenger constraints. We address implications of\nthese neutrinos being produced in transient sources, principally if buried\nwithin supernovae so that gamma rays are absorbed by the star. This would\nalleviate tension with the isotropic Fermi GeV background that >10 TeV\nneutrinos rival in detected energy flux. We find that IceCube data constrain\ntransient properties, implying buried GeV-TeV electromagnetic emission near or\nexceeding canonical SN explosion energies of ~10^51 erg, indicative of an\norigin within superluminous SNe. TeV neutrino bursts with dozens of IceCube\nevents -- which would be of great use for understanding r-process\nnucleosynthesis and more -- may be just around the corner if they are a primary\ncomponent of the flux.\n", "  Magnetic holes have been frequently observed in the magnetosheath of Earth\nand it is believed that these structures are the result of nonlinear evolution\nof mirror instability. Mirror mode fluctuations mostly appear as magnetic holes\nin regions where plasma is marginally mirror stable with respect to the linear\ninstability. We present an expanding box particle in cell simulation to mimic\nthe magnetosheath plasma and produce the mirror mode magnetic holes. We show\nthat magnetic peaks are dominant when plasma is mirror unstable and mirror\nfluctuations evolve to deep magnetic holes when plasma is marginally mirror\nstable. Although, the averaged plasma parameters in the simulation are\nmarginally close to mirror instability threshold, the plasma in the magnetic\nholes is highly unstable to mirror instability and mirror stable in the\nmagnetic peaks.\n", "  Ferrofluids are typically suspensions of magnetite nanoparticles, and behave\nas a homogeneous continuum. The production of nanoparticles with a narrow size\ndistribution and the achievement of colloidal stability are important\ntechnological issues. The ability of the ferrofluid to respond to an external\nmagnetic field in a controllable manner has made it emerge as a smart material\nin a variety of applications, such as seals, lubricants, electronics cooling,\nshock absorbers and adaptive optics. Magnetic nanoparticle suspensions have\nalso gained attraction recently in a range of biomedical applications, such as\ncell separation, hyperthermia, MRI, drug targeting and cancer diagnosis. In\nthis review, we provide an introduction to mathematical modeling of three\nproblems: motion of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in magnetic drug targeting,\nthe motion of a ferrofluid drop consisting of chemically bound nanoparticles\nwithout a carrier fluid, and the breakage of a thin film of a ferrofluid.\n", "  Ubiquity of unconventional phenomena observed in a series of heavy fermion\nmetals is discussed on the basis of an idea of critical valence fluctuations.\nAfter surveying experimental aspects of these unconventional behaviors in\nprototypical compounds, CeCu_2(Si,Ge)_2, under pressure, we propose that sharp\nvalence crossover phenomena are realized in CeCu_6, CeRhIn_5, and Ce(Ir,Rh)Si_3\nby tuning the pressure and the magnetic field simultaneously, on the basis of\nprevious results for an extended Anderson lattice model with the Coulomb\nrepulsion U_fc between localized f-electron and itinerant conduction electrons.\n", "  Global recruitment into radical Islamic movements has spurred renewed\ninterest in the appeal of political extremism. Is the appeal a rational\nresponse to material conditions or is it the expression of psychological and\npersonality disorders associated with aggressive behavior, intolerance,\nconspiratorial imagination, and paranoia? Empirical answers using surveys have\nbeen limited by lack of access to extremist groups, while field studies have\nlacked psychological measures and failed to compare extremists with contrast\ngroups. We revisit the debate over the appeal of extremism in the U.S. context\nby comparing publicly available Twitter messages written by over 355,000\npolitical extremist followers with messages written by non-extremist U.S.\nusers. Analysis of text-based psychological indicators supports the moral\nfoundation theory which identifies emotion as a critical factor in determining\npolitical orientation of individuals. Extremist followers also differ from\nothers in four of the Big Five personality traits.\n", "  Witnessing non-classicality in the gravitational field has been claimed to be\npractically impossible. This constitutes a deep problem, which has even lead\nsome researchers to question whether gravity should be quantised, due to the\nweakness of quantum effects. To counteract these claims, we propose a thought\nexperiment that witnesses non-classicality of a physical system by probing it\nwith a qubit. Remarkably, this experiment does not require any quantum control\nof the system, involving only measuring a single classical observable on that\nsystem. In addition, our scheme does not even assume any specific dynamics.\nThat non-classicality of a system can be established indirectly, by coupling it\nto a qubit, opens up the possibility that quantum gravitational effects could\nin fact be witnessed in the lab.\n", "  Using the self-consistent Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach we simulate and\nanalyze the spontaneous formation of the domain structure in thin ferroelectric\nfilms covered with the surface screening charge of the specific nature\n(Bardeen-type surface states). Hence we consider the competition between the\nscreening and the domain formation as alternative ways to reduce the\nelectrostatic energy and reveal unusual peculiarities of distributions of\npolarization, electric and elastic fields conditioned by the surface screening\nlength and the flexocoupling strength. We have established that the critical\nthickness of the film and its transition temperature to a paraelectric phase\nstrongly depend on the Bardeen screening length, while the flexocoupling\naffects the polarization rotation and closure domain structure and induces\nribbon-like nano-scale domains in the film depth far from the top open surface.\nHence the joint action of the surface screening (originating from e.g. the\nadsorption of ambient ions or surface states) and flexocoupling may remarkably\nmodify polar and electromechanical properties of thin ferroelectric films.\n", "  Users of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter rely on crowdsourced\ncontent recommendation systems (e.g., Trending Topics) to retrieve important\nand useful information. Contents selected for recommendation indirectly give\nthe initial users who promoted (by liking or posting) the content an\nopportunity to propagate their messages to a wider audience. Hence, it is\nimportant to understand the demographics of people who make a content worthy of\nrecommendation, and explore whether they are representative of the media site's\noverall population. In this work, using extensive data collected from Twitter,\nwe make the first attempt to quantify and explore the demographic biases in the\ncrowdsourced recommendations. Our analysis, focusing on the selection of\ntrending topics, finds that a large fraction of trends are promoted by crowds\nwhose demographics are significantly different from the overall Twitter\npopulation. More worryingly, we find that certain demographic groups are\nsystematically under-represented among the promoters of the trending topics. To\nmake the demographic biases in Twitter trends more transparent, we developed\nand deployed a Web-based service 'Who-Makes-Trends' at\ntwitter-app.mpi-sws.org/who-makes-trends.\n", "  Results from the physical, simultaneous, inversion of the full IASI (Infrared\nAtmospheric Sounder Interferometer) spectra applied to the retrieval of surface\ntemperature and emissivity, temperature, water vapour, ozone and HDO vertical\nprofiles, and gas column abundance of CO2, CO, CH4, SO2, N2O, HNO3, NH3, OCS\nand CF4 have been updated with respect to the validation of OCS and O3\nproducts. A case study has been set up and analysed, which consists of a two\nyears long record of IASI spectra over sea surface in the Pacific Ocean close\nto the Mauna Loa (Hawaii) validation station. IASI O3 products have been\nintercompared with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) O3 retrievals, which, in\ncontrast to IASI that uses the thermal infrared, are based on observation in\nthe near ultra violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. IASI OCS\nretrievals are compared to in situ flask observations. The IASI vs OMI\ncomparison shows an excellent agreement with a correlation of 0.97 and a\nrelative bias of approximately 1 Dobson Unit. For the case of OCS, we have\nfound a good correlation of 0.75 for night time soundings. IASI captures the\nOCS seasonal cycle, although a relatively large negative bias of approximately\n-74 pptv is seen, which can be explained with a large spectroscopic error for\nOCS in the HITRAN 2008 version.\n", "  e-ASTROGAM is a space mission with unprecedented sensitivity to photons in\nthe MeV range, proposed within the ESA M5 call. In this note we describe some\nmeasurements sensitive to axion-like particles, for which performance in the\nMeV/GeV range is of primary importance, and e-ASTROGAM could be the key for\ndiscovery. Keywords: Axions. ALPs. Dark-matter candidates. Gamma-ray\nastrophysics.\n", "  We make use of the conformal compactification of Minkowski spacetime $M^{\\#}$\nto explore a way of describing general, nonlinear Maxwell fields with conformal\nsymmetry. We distinguish the inverse Minkowski spacetime $[M^{\\#}]^{-1}$\nobtained via conformal inversion, so as to discuss a doubled compactified\nspacetime on which Maxwell fields may be defined. Identifying $M^{\\#}$ with the\nprojective light cone in $(4+2)$-dimensional spacetime, we write two\nindependent conformal-invariant functionals of the $6$-dimensional Maxwellian\nfield strength tensors -- one bilinear, the other trilinear in the field\nstrengths -- which are to enter general nonlinear constitutive equations. We\nalso make some remarks regarding the dimensional reduction procedure as we\nconsider its generalization from linear to general nonlinear theories.\n", "  Constructing the corresponding geometries from given entanglement entropies\nof a boundary QFT is a big challenge and leads to the grand project \\emph{ it\nfrom Qubit}. Based on the observation that the AdS metric in the Riemann Normal\nCoordinates (RNC) can be summed into a closed form, we find that the AdS$_3$\nmetric in RNC can be straightforwardly read off from the entanglement entropy\nof CFT$_2$. We use the finite length or finite temperature CFT$_2$ as examples\nto demonstrate the identification.\n", "  Although well studied, the neutron still offers a unique laboratory for\nprecise tests of Standard Model (SM) predictions. Neutron decay is free of\nnuclear structure corrections present in nuclear beta decays, and, with a\n$10^8$ times larger branching ratio than the theoretically cleaner pion beta\ndecay, it is more readily accessible to experimental study than the latter.\nMeasurements at sufficient precision of the neutron lifetime, and of\ncorrelations in free neutron beta decay, offer several stringent tests of the\nSM, including the weak quark couplings (quark-lepton universality), and certain\nextensions beyond the standard $V-A$ weak interaction theory. This paper\nfocuses on the long-running free neutron beta decay experimental program aimed\nat obtaining an independent determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\n(CKM) mixing matrix element $V_{ud}$. We discuss the present state of precision\nachieved in this program and briefly review the currently active projects, as\nwell as the expected near-term improvements in the field.\n", "  The emission properties of PbTe(111) single crystal have been extensively\ninvestigated to demonstrate that PbTe(111) is a promising low root mean square\ntransverse momentum ({\\Delta}p$_T$) and high brightness photocathode. The\ndensity functional theory (DFT) based photoemission analysis successfully\nelucidates that the 'hole-like' {\\Lambda}$^+_6$ energy band in the $L$ valley\nwith low effective mass $m^*$ results in low {\\Delta}p$_T$. Especially, as a\n300K solid planar photocathode, Te-terminated PbTe(111) single crystal is\nexpected to be a potential 50K electron source.\n", "  Modern theoretical estimates show that with the help of real equipment we are\nable to detect large satellites of exoplanets (about the size of the Ganymede),\nalthough, numerical attempts of direct exomoon detection were unsuccessful.\nLots of methods for finding the satellites of exoplanets for various reasons\nhave not yielded results. Some of the proposed methods are oriented on a more\naccurate telescopes than those exist today. In this work, we propose a method\nbased on relationship between the transit timing variation (TTV) and the\nbrightness fluctuations (BF) before and after the planetary transit. With the\nhelp of a numerical simulation of the Earth-Moon system transits, we have\nconstructed data on the BF and the TTV for any configuration of an individual\ntransit. The experimental charts obtained indicate an easily detectable near\nlinear dependence. Even with an artificial increase in orbital speed of the\nMoon and high-level errors in measurements the patterns suggest an accurate\ncorrelation. A significant advantage of the method is its convenience for\nmultiple moons systems due to an additive properties of the TTV and the BF. Its\nalso important that mean motion resonance (MMR) in system have no affect on\nability of satellites detection. At the end we tried to retrieve parameters of\nthe Moon (without additional satellites) on the basis of the simulated\nphotometric curves. The results perform errors at the level of $\\approx 0.45$\nfor the mass and $\\approx 0.24$ for the radius with TTV measurements accuracy\n=60s and Kepler-like noise for photometry.\n", "  We investigate the effects related to vortex core deformations when vortices\napproach each other. As a result of these vortex core deformations, the\nvortex-vortex interaction effectively acquires an attractive component leading\nto a variety of vortex patterns typical for systems with non-monotonic\nrepulsive-attractive interaction, such as stripes, labyrinths, etc. The core\ndeformations are anisotropic and can induce frustration in the vortex-vortex\ninteraction. In turn, this frustration has an impact on the resulting vortex\npatterns, which are analyzed in the presence of additional random pinning, as a\nfunction of the pinning strength. This analysis can be applicable to vortices\nin multiband superconductors or to vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  The Wick-Cutkosky model is investigated using the framework of the Nakanishi\nPerturbative Integral Representation projected in the Light-Front hyperplane\nfor an s-wave amplitude. We developed a new technique based on sucessive\nintegration by parts of the Nakanishi Representation which enabled us to\ntransform one of the integrations into a sum. With a set of boundary conditions\nit was possible to guess the format of the solution, which was in fact a\ndistribution. The eigenequations obtained were the same as the originals of\nCutkosky \\cite{CutPR54}. Finally, a numerical check confirmed that the final\nequation reproduce the same eigenvalues as the initial Bethe-Salpeter equation.\n", "  This paper derives the non-analytic solution to the Fokker-Planck equation of\nfractional Brownian motion using the method of Laplace transform. Sequentially,\nby considering the fundamental solution of the non-analytic solution, this\npaper obtains the transition probability density function of the random\nvariable that is described by the It\\^o's stochastic ordinary differential\nequation of fractional Brownian motion. Furthermore, this paper applies the\nderived transition probability density function to the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model\ngoverned by the fractional Brownian motion instead of the usual Brownian\nmotion.\n", "  We demonstrate the application of the efficient semi-inverse asymptotic\nmethod to resonant interaction of the nonlinear normal modes belonging to\ndifferent branches of the CNT vibration spectrum. Under condition of the 1:1\nresonance of the beam and circumferential flexure modes we obtain the dynamical\nequations, the solutions of which describe the coupled stationary states. The\nlatter are characterized by the non-uniform distribution of the energy along\nthe circumferential coordinate. The non-stationary solutions for obtained\nequations correspond to the slow change of the energy distribution. It is shown\nthat adequate description of considered resonance processes can be achieved in\nthe domain variables. They are the linear combinations of the shell- and\nbeam-type normal modes. Using such variables we have analyzed not only\nnonlinear normal modes but also the limiting phase trajectories describing the\nstrongly non-stationary dynamics. The evolution of the considered resonance\nprocesses with the oscillation amplitude growth is analyzed by the phase\nportrait method and verified by the numerical integration of the respective\ndynamical equations.\n", "  In our previous paper (Phys. Rev. D 94, 104030 (2016)), inspired by the work\nof Allen and Turyn (Nucl. Phys. B 292, 813 (1987)), we expressed the graviton\ntwo-point function in terms of maximally symmetric bitensors in de Sitter\nspacetime. Quite contrary to the result of their work, however, we explicitly\nshowed that the de Sitter symmetry breaking is universal and the associated\ninfrared divergences cannot be gauged away. In this Letter, the origin of this\ncontradiction, which is greatly related to the well-known scientific dispute\nabout the infrared behavior of the graviton two-point function, is clarified.\n", "  We consider application of a temporal imaging system, based on the\nsum-frequency generation, to a nonclassical, in particular, squeezed optical\ntemporal waveform. We analyze the restrictions on the pump and the phase\nmatching condition in the summing crystal, necessary for preserving the quantum\nfeatures of the initial waveform. We show that modification of the notion of\nthe field of view in the quantum case is necessary, and that the quantum field\nof view is much narrower than the classical one for the same temporal imaging\nsystem. These results are important for temporal stretching and compressing of\nsqueezed fields, used in quantum-enhanced metrology and quantum communications.\n", "  The conductance curves of point-contact tunnel junctions between Ag and $\\rm\nBa_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ ($x\\simeq 0.4$) reveal a BCS behavior with low leakage\ncurrent at zero voltage and some broadening of the superconducting-gap\nstructure. In the energy range above the superconducting energy gap, the\nstructure in the voltage dependence of the second derivative $d^2V/dI^2$ of the\nvoltage with respect to the current of the tunnel junction has been\ninvestigated in detail in magnetic fields up to $10\\ T$. While part of this\nstructure is rapidly changing in a magnetic field, three reproducible peaks in\n$d^2V/dI^2(V)$ remain stable up to the transition temperature from the\nsuperconducting to the normal state with only additional broadening in the\napplied magnetic field. An analysis of this structure in terms of\nstrong-coupling effects yields the spectral function $\\alpha^2F$ for the\nelectron-phonon interaction. The obtained spectral weight in the energy region\n20-70~$meV$ points to the importance of the oxygen optical modes in the\nelectron-phonon coupling for the superconductivity of $\\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$.\n", "  The superconducting energy gap of $\\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ has been measured by\ntunneling. Despite the fact that the sample was macroscopically single phase\nwith very sharp superconducting transition $T_c$ at 32~$K$, some of the\nmeasured tunnel junctions made by point contacts between silver tip and single\ncrystal of $\\rm Ba_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ had lower transition at 20~$K$. Local\nvariation of the potassium concentration as well as oxygen deficiency in $\\rm\nBa_{1-x}K_xBiO_3$ at the place where the point contact is made can account for\nthe change of $T_c$. The conductance curves of the tunnel junctions reveal the\nBCS behavior with a small broadening of the superconducting-gap structure. A\nvalue of the energy gap scales with $T_c$. The reduced gap amounts to\n$2\\Delta/kT_c = 4\\div 4.3$ indicating a medium coupling strength. Temperature\ndependence of the energy gap follows the BCS prediction.\n", "  This proceeding reports the ATLAS results of measuring vector boson\nproduction in $pp$ and $p$+Pb collisions at the center-of-mass energy of\n5.02~TeV per nucleon. $Z$ boson bosons are reconstructed via leptonic decays\nand results are presented as a function of $Z$-boson rapidity. $W$ boson bosons\nare identified by measuring leptons coming from $W$ boson decays and the\nresults are presented as a function of lepton pseudorapidity. In $pp$\ncollisions $Z$ boson boson cross section in $|y_{Z}|<2.5$ is 590$\\pm$9\n(stat.)$\\pm$12 (syst.)$\\pm$32 (lumi.) pb. In $p$+Pb system kinematic\ndistributions of $W$ boson and $Z$ boson bosons are compared to models based on\nNLO and NNLO QCD calculations using different PDF sets. Using PDF modification\nshows better agreement of the model and the data. Measurements done in\ndifferent centrality intervals show that the PDF modification in $p$+Pb may\nhave centrality dependence.\n", "  Current experimental data on cosmic-ray charged leptons are briefly reviewed\nincluding measurements of the positron fraction, electron and positron spectra\nand inclusive electron+positron data. Precision measurements by PAMELA and\nAMS-02 of the positron spectrum and its striking difference from the electron\nspectrum have prompted several theoretical speculations. In order to\ndiscriminate among different interpretations of the 'positron anomaly', a major\nstep is needed to achieve an accurate direct measurement of the shape of the\ninclusive electron spectrum beyond 1 TeV. Ongoing efforts along this direction\nby instruments already in orbit and by the recently launched CALET and DAMPE\nmissions are described. A challenging experimental scenario, at variance with\nthe standard paradigm of a single power law spectrum, emerges for the\ncosmic-ray charged hadrons after the discovery of a discrepant hardening in the\nrigidity spectra of protons and He in the 200 to 300 GV region (CREAM, PAMELA,\nAMS-02) and the observation by AMS-02 of a possible break in the Li spectrum.\nAn additional puzzle comes from the apparent violation of the universality of\nspectral indices whereby He and proton spectra are progressively hardening\nabove ~100 GV with a similar rigidity dependence, but the He spectrum is harder\nthan proton's. Secondary-to-primary ratios and isotope flux ratios provide\ninsight into the subtleties of propagation mechanism(s) and test the internal\nconsistency of the models of acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the\ngalaxy. Important complementary information on the abundance of nuclei heavier\nthan iron comes from dedicated balloon-borne instruments as SuperTIGER or\nspace-based missions as ACE at L1 that provided the first measurement of a\nprimary \"cosmic-ray clock\". A brief overview of future missions is given at the\nend of the paper.\n", "  The study of spin-orbit coupling of photons has attracted much attention in\nrecent years, and leads to many potential applications in optics. In the\nrecently discovered metamaterial -- photonic crystals with Weyl points, the\npseudospin-orbit coupling of photons bears a resemblance to the spin-orbit\ncoupling. We study the pseudospin Hall effect of light in such metamaterials\nand find that during total reflection, the light beam experiences a transverse\nshift that is proportional to the pseudospin (or the monopole charge) of the\nWeyl point. As the spin Hall effect has inspired many works to explore the\napplications in optics, exploring the coupling between the orbital and\npseudospin degrees of freedom of photons can also be fruitful in the field of\noptics, as well as in other fields where Weyl points can be realized.\n", "  We consider a system of monodisperse hard spheres immersed in a sheared\nfluid. We obtain the distortion of the structure factor of the hard spheres at\nlow shear rates, within a Percus-Yevick like framework. The consequent\ndistortion of the pair distribution function is shown to affect the transition\nof the hard sphere fluid into a jammed state, which is similar to the\ntransition to the state of random close packing in the absence of shear.\n", "  Angular differential imaging provides a novel way of probing the high\ncontrast of our universe. Until now, its applications have been primarily\nlocalized to searching for exoplanets around nearby stars. This work presents a\nsuite of applications of angular differential imaging from the theoretical\nunderpinning of data reduction, to its use characterizing substellar objects to\na new application looking for the host galaxies of damped Lyman {\\alpha}\nsystems, which are usually lost in the glare of ultra-bright quasars along the\nline of sight.\n", "  This contribution deals with image restoration in optical systems with\ncoherent illumination, which is an important topic in astronomy, coherent\nmicroscopy and radar imaging. Such optical systems suffer from wavefront\ndistortions, which are caused by imperfect imaging components and conditions.\nKnown image restoration algorithms work well for incoherent imaging, they fail\nin case of coherent images. In this paper a novel wavefront correction\nalgorithm is presented, which allows image restoration under coherent\nconditions. In most coherent imaging systems, especially in astronomy, the\nwavefront deformation is known. Using this information, the proposed algorithm\nallows a high quality restoration even in case of severe wavefront distortions.\nWe present two versions of this algorithm, which are an evolution of the\nGerchberg-Saxton and the Hybrid-Input-Output algorithm. The algorithm is\nverified on simulated and real microscopic images.\n", "  This article presents a review of epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide, from\nfabrication to properties, put in the context of other forms of graphene.\n", "  Many complex systems can be represented as networks, and the problem of\nnetwork comparison is becoming increasingly relevant. There are many techniques\nfor network comparison, from simply comparing network summary statistics to\nsophisticated but computationally costly alignment-based approaches. Yet it\nremains challenging to accurately cluster networks that are of a different size\nand density, but hypothesized to be structurally similar. In this paper, we\naddress this problem by introducing a new network comparison methodology that\nis aimed at identifying common organizational principles in networks. The\nmethodology is simple, intuitive and applicable in a wide variety of settings\nranging from the functional classification of proteins to tracking the\nevolution of a world trade network.\n", "  Modulational instability has been used to explain the formation of breather\nand rogue waves qualitatively. In this paper, we show modulational instability\ncan be used to explain the structure of them in a quantitative way. We develop\na method to derive general forms for Akhmediev breather and rogue wave\nsolutions in a $N$-component nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. The existence\ncondition for each pattern is clarified clearly. Moreover, the general\nmulti-high-order rogue wave solutions and multi-Akhmediev breather solutions\nfor $N$-component nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations are constructed. The\nresults further deepen our understanding on the quantitative relations between\nmodulational instability and homoclinic orbits solutions.\n", "  In this paper, we study Landau damping in the weakly collisional limit of a\nVlasov-Fokker-Planck equation with nonlinear collisions in the phase-space\n$(x,v) \\in \\mathbb T_x^n \\times \\mathbb R^n_v$. The goal is four-fold: (A) to\nunderstand how collisions suppress plasma echoes and enable Landau damping in\nagreement with linearized theory in Sobolev spaces, (B) to understand how phase\nmixing accelerates collisional relaxation, (C) to understand better how the\nplasma returns to global equilibrium during Landau damping, and (D) to rule out\nthat collision-driven nonlinear instabilities dominate. We give an estimate for\nthe scaling law between Knudsen number and the maximal size of the perturbation\nnecessary for linear theory to be accurate in Sobolev regularity. We conjecture\nthis scaling to be sharp (up to logarithmic corrections) due to potential\nnonlinear echoes in the collisionless model.\n", "  A key element in the study of cold atoms, and their use in emerging quantum\ntechnologies, is trapping the atoms in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber. Many\nmethods have been used to trap atoms including atom chips and magneto-optical\ntraps (MOTs). However, the bulky apparatus, and current-carrying coils, used so\nfar in most MOTs restrict the reduction of power and physical size, as required\nfor quantum technology applications. The advent of 3D printing technology now\noffers a new route to making MOTs with current paths that can be freely shaped\nand shrunk to several centimetres, thereby helping to reduce the power\nconsumption and simplify the production of the MOT itself. In this paper, we\npresent designs for 3D printed MOTs and analyse their performance by using\nCOMSOL simulations. We predict that the 3D-printed conductors can create\nmagnetic fields with gradients around 15 G/cm and passing through zero, as\nrequired for atom trapping, with Joule heating as low as 0.2 W.\n", "  Preplanetary nebulae and planetary nebulae are evolved, mass-losing stellar\nobjects that show a wide variety of morphologies. Many of these nebulae consist\nof outer structures that are nearly spherical (spiral/shell/arc/halo) and inner\nstructures that are highly asymmetric (bipolar/multipolar). The coexistence of\nsuch geometrically distinct structures is enigmatic because it hints at the\nsimultaneous presence of both wide and close binary interactions, a phenomenon\nthat has been attributed to stellar binary systems with eccentric orbits. Here\nwe report new high-resolution molecular-line observations of the circumstellar\nspiral-shell pattern of AFGL 3068, an asymptotic giant branch star\ntransitioning to the preplanetary nebula phase. The observations clearly reveal\nthat the dynamics of the mass loss is influenced by the presence of an\neccentric-orbit binary. This quintessential object opens a new window on the\nnature of deeply embedded binary stars through the circumstellar spiral-shell\npatterns that reside at distances of several thousand Astronomical Units from\nthe stars.\n", "  There are many exotic scenarios where the Lorenz number of the\nWiedemann-Franz law is known to deviate from expected values. However, in\nconventional semiconductor systems, it is assumed to vary between the values of\n~1.49x10^{-8} W {\\Omega} K^{-2} for non-degenerate semiconductors and\n~2.45x10^{-8} W {\\Omega} K^{-2} for degenerate semiconductors or metals.\nKnowledge of the Lorenz number is important in many situations, such as in the\ndesign of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the\nlattice thermal conductivity. Here we show that, even in the simple case of two\nand three band semiconductors, it is possible to obtain substantial deviations\nof a factor of two (or in the case of a bipolar system with a Fermi level near\nthe midgap, even orders of magnitude) from expectation. In addition to\nidentifying the sources of deviation in unipolar and bipolar two-band systems,\na number of analytical expressions useful for quantifying the size of the\neffect are derived. As representative case-studies, a three-band model of the\nmaterials of lead telluride (PbTe) and tin sellenide (SnSe), which are\nimportant thermoelectric materials, is also developed and the size of possible\nLorenz number variations in these materials explored. Thus, the consequence of\nmulti-band effects on the Lorenz number of real systems is demonstrated.\n", "  The controlled handling of liquids and colloidal suspensions as they interact\nwith surfaces, targeting a broad palette of related functionalities, is of\ngreat importance in science, technology, and nature. When small liquid volumes\nneed to be processed in microfluidic devices, contamination on the solid-liquid\ninterface and loss of liquid due to adhesion on the transport channels are two\nvery common problems that can significantly alter the process outcome, e.g. the\nchemical reaction efficiency, or the purity and the final concentrations of a\nsuspension. It is therefore no surprise that both levitation and minimal\ncontact transport methods including non wetting surfaces have been developed to\nminimize the interactions between liquids and surfaces. Here we demonstrate\ncontactless surface levitation and transport of liquid drops, realized by\nharnessing and sustaining the natural sublimation of a solid carbon\ndioxide-coated substrate to generate a continuous supporting vapor layer. The\ncapability and limitations of this technique in handling liquids of extreme\nsurface tension and kinematic viscosity values are investigated both\nexperimentally and theoretically. The sublimating coating is capable of\nrepelling many viscous and low surface tension liquids, colloidal suspensions,\nand non-Newtonian fluids as well, displaying outstanding omniphobic properties.\nFinally, we demonstrate how sublimation can be used for liquid transport,\nmixing and drop coalescence, with a sublimating layer coated on an underlying\nsubstrate with prefabricated channels, conferring omniphobicity with a simple\nphysical approach, rather than a chemical one.\n", "  The diffusion weighted images acquired with the multiband sequence or the\nLifespan protocols shows a type of slice distortion artifact. We find that this\nartifact is caused by the eddy currents, which can be induced by the diffusion\ngradient associated with either current DW image or the previous DW images. The\nartifact can be corrected by further tuning the compensation circuit in the MR\nhardware, or by a correction algorithm which includes the diffusion gradients\nfrom the current and previous DW images.\n", "  Periodic solutions of the three body problem are very important for\nunderstanding its dynamics either in a theoretical framework or in various\napplications in celestial mechanics. In this paper we discuss the computation\nand continuation of periodic orbits for planetary systems. The study is\nrestricted to coplanar motion. Staring from known results of two-planet systems\naround single stars, we perform continuation of solutions with respect to the\nmass and approach periodic orbits of single planets in two-star systems. Also,\nfamilies of periodic solutions can be computed for fixed masses of the\nprimaries. When they are linearly stable, we can conclude about the existence\nof phase space domains of long-term orbital stability.\n", "  We consider resonances for fourth order differential operators on the\nhalf-line with compactly supported coefficients. We determine asymptotics of a\ncounting function of resonances in complex discs at large radius, describe the\nforbidden domain for resonances and obtain trace formulas in terms of\nresonances. We apply these results to the Euler-Bernoulli operator on the\nhalf-line. The coefficients of this operator are positive and constants outside\na finite interval. We show that this operator does not have any eigenvalues and\nresonances iff its coefficients are constants on the whole half-line.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide field-effect transistors (FETs) have been\nactively explored for low-power electronics, light detection, and sensing.\nAlbeit promising, their performance is strongly limited by low-frequency noise\n(LFN). Here, we report on the study of LFN in MoS$_2$ FETs on SiO$_2$\nsubstrates in ambient conditions using photodoping. Using this external\nexcitation source allows us to access different non-equilibrium steady states\nand cross over different noise regimes. We observe a dependence of the noise\npower spectrum with the transient decay time window, approaching $1/f$-type\nwhen the system is closer to equilibrium, and identify a dependence of the LFN\nwith channel thickness. Monolayer/bilayer devices exhibit random telegraph\nnoise for insulating regimes and $1/f$-type Hooge mobility fluctuations (HMF)\nfor conductive regimes. Thicker devices exhibit mainly $1/f$-type carrier\nnumber fluctuations (CNF). In the latter, we observe a photodoping-induced\nchange from a near parabolic to a near linear dependence of the inverse $1/f$\nnoise amplitude above the threshold gate voltage. This change indicates a\ncrossover in the LFN mechanism from CNF to HMF. We demonstrate that the study\nof conductance and noise under photodoping is an effective tool to identify\ndominating carrier noise mechanisms in few-atomic-layer FETs for a wide range\nof doping regimes.\n", "  Leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays represent till now the golden modes for\nthe extraction of the Cabibbo angle from experiments, provided the relevant\nhadronic quantities, namely the ratio of the kaon and pion leptonic decay\nconstants, $f_K / f_\\pi$, and the semileptonic vector form factor at zero\nfour-momentum transfer, $f_+(0)$, are computed accurately from QCD. In the last\nyears, using large-scale lattice QCD simulations, the determination of both\n$f_K / f_\\pi$ and $f_+(0)$ has reached an impressive level of precision\n($\\approx 0.3 \\%$), which is expected to be further improved in the near\nfuture. However, at a permille level of precision both electromagnetic and\nstrong isospin-breaking effects cannot be neglected anymore. In this\ncontribution a new lattice strategy aiming at determining QCD+QED effects in\nthe inclusive leptonic decay rates of charged pseudoscalar mesons is briefly\nillustrated, and the preliminary results obtained in the case of $\\pi_{\\ell 2}$\nand $K_{\\ell 2}$ decays are presented. As for the semileptonic $K_{\\ell 3}$\ndecays, it is pointed out that the determination of the relevant form factors\nin the full kinematical range covered by the experiments is necessary for a\nmore stringent test of the Standard Model. In this respect the perspectives\nbased on the only existing results from the European Twisted Mass Collaboration\n(ETMC) are quite encouraging.\n", "  Comets are thought to preserve almost pristine dust particles, thus providing\na unique sample of the properties of the early solar nebula. The microscopic\nproperties of this dust played a key part in particle aggregation during the\nformation of the Solar System. Cometary dust was previously considered to\ncomprise irregular, fluffy agglomerates on the basis of interpretations of\nremote observations in the visible and infrared and the study of chondritic\nporous interplanetary dust particles that were thought, but not proved, to\noriginate in comets. Although the dust returned by an earlier mission has\nprovided detailed mineralogy of particles from comet 81P/Wild, the fine-grained\naggregate component was strongly modified during collection. Here we report in\nsitu measurements of dust particles at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The\nparticles are aggregates of smaller, elongated grains, with structures at\ndistinct sizes indicating hierarchical aggregation. Topographic images of\nselected dust particles with sizes of one micrometre to a few tens of\nmicrometres show a variety of morphologies, including compact single grains and\nlarge porous aggregate particles, similar to chondritic porous interplanetary\ndust particles. The measured grain elongations are similar to the value\ninferred for interstellar dust and support the idea that such grains could\nrepresent a fraction of the building blocks of comets. In the subsequent growth\nphase, hierarchical agglomeration could be a dominant process and would produce\naggregates that stick more easily at higher masses and velocities than\nhomogeneous dust particles. The presence of hierarchical dust aggregates in the\nnear-surface of the nucleus of comet 67P also provides a mechanism for lowering\nthe tensile strength of the dust layer and aiding dust release.\n", "  Spin-charge interconversion is currently the focus of intensive experimental\nand theoretical research both for its intrinsic interest and for its potential\nexploitation in the realization of new spintronic functionalities. Spin-orbit\ncoupling is one of the key microscopic mechanisms to couple charge currents and\nspin polarizations. The Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas has been shown to give rise to the inverse spin galvanic effect,\ni.e. the generation of a non-equilibrium spin polarization by a charge current.\nWhereas the Rashba model may be applied to the interpretation of experimental\nresults in many cases, in general in a given real physical system spin-orbit\ncoupling also occurs due other mechanisms such as Dresselhaus bulk inversion\nasymmetry and scattering from impurities. In this work we consider the inverse\nspin galvanic effect in the presence of Rashba, Dresselhaus and impurity\nspin-orbit scattering. We find that the size and form of the inverse spin\ngalvanic effect is greatly modified by the presence of the various sources of\nspin-orbit coupling. Indeed, spin-orbit coupling affects the spin relaxation\ntime by adding the Elliott-Yafet mechanism to the Dyakonov-Perel and,\nfurthermore, it changes the non-equilibrium value of the current-induced spin\npolarization by introducing a new spin generation torque. We use a diagrammatic\nKubo formula approach to evaluate the spin polarization-charge current response\nfunction. We finally comment about the relevance of our results for the\ninterpretation of experimental results.\n", "  The theoretical cross section calculations for the astrophysical $p$ process\nare needed because the most of the related reactions are technically very\ndifficult to be measured in the laboratory. Even if the reaction was measured,\nmost of the measured reactions have been carried out at the higher energy range\nfrom the astrophysical energies. Therefore, almost all cross sections needed\nfor $p$ process simulation has to be theoretically calculated or extrapolated\nto the astrophysical energies. The $^{112}$Sn($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{116}$Te is\nan important reaction for the $p$ process nucleosynthesis. The theoretical\ncross section of the $^{112}$Sn($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{116}$Te reaction was\ninvestigated for different global optical model potentials, level density and\nstrength function models at the astrophysically interested energies.\nAstrophysical $S$ factors were calculated and compared with experimental data\navailable in EXFOR database. The calculation with the optical model potential\nof the dispersive model by Demetriou et al., and Back-shifted Fermi gas level\ndensity model and Brink-Axel Lorentzian strength function model best served to\nreproduce experimental results at astrophysically relevant energy region. The\nreaction rates were calculated with these model parameters at the $p$ process\ntemperature and compared with the current version of the reaction rate library\nReaclib and Starlib.\n", "  We consider the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for a one-parameter family of explicit scale-invariant\naxi-symmetric initial data, which is smooth away from the origin and invariant\nunder the reflection with respect to the $xy$-plane. Working in the class of\naxi-symmetric fields, we calculate numerically scale-invariant solutions of the\nCauchy problem in terms of their profile functions, which are smooth. The\nsolutions are necessarily unique for small data, but for large data we observe\na breaking of the reflection symmetry of the initial data through a\npitchfork-type bifurcation. By a variation of previous results by Jia &\n\\v{S}ver\\'ak (2013) it is known rigorously that if the behavior seen here\nnumerically can be proved, optimal non-uniqueness examples for the Cauchy\nproblem can be established, and two different solutions can exists for the same\ninitial datum which is divergence-free, smooth away from the origin, compactly\nsupported, and locally $(-1)$-homogeneous near the origin. In particular,\nassuming our (finite-dimensional) numerics represents faithfully the behavior\nof the full (infinite-dimensional) system, the problem of uniqueness of the\nLeray-Hopf solutions (with non-smooth initial data) has a negative answer and,\nin addition, the perturbative arguments such those by Kato (1984) and Koch &\nTataru (2001), or the weak-strong uniqueness results by Leray, Prodi, Serrin,\nLadyzhenskaya and others, already give essentially optimal results. There are\nno singularities involved in the numerics, as we work only with smooth profile\nfunctions. It is conceivable that our calculations could be upgraded to a\ncomputer-assisted proof, although this would involve a substantial amount of\nadditional work and calculations, including a much more detailed analysis of\nthe asymptotic expansions of the solutions at large distances.\n", "  The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is important for bringing rainfall to\nlarge areas of China. Historically, variations in the EASM have had major\nimpacts including flooding and drought. We present an analysis of the impact of\nanthropogenic climate change on EASM rainfall in Eastern China using a newly\nupdated attribution system. Our results suggest that anthropogenic climate\nchange has led to an overall decrease in total monsoon rainfall over the past\n65 years, and an increased number of dry days. However the model also predicts\nthat anthropogenic forcings have caused the most extreme heavy rainfall events\nto become shorter in duration and more intense. With the potential for future\nchanges in aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions, historical trends in monsoon\nrainfall may not be indicative of future changes, although extreme rainfall is\nprojected to increase over East Asia with continued warming in the region.\n", "  We study the influence of degree correlations or network mixing in\ninterdependent security. We model the interdependence in security among agents\nusing a dependence graph and employ a population game model to capture the\ninteraction among many agents when they are strategic and have various security\nmeasures they can choose to defend themselves. The overall network security is\nmeasured by what we call the average risk exposure (ARE) from neighbors, which\nis proportional to the total (expected) number of attacks in the network.\n  We first show that there exists a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a\npopulation game. Then, we prove that as the agents with larger degrees in the\ndependence graph see higher risks than those with smaller degrees, the overall\nnetwork security deteriorates in that the ARE experienced by agents increases\nand there are more attacks in the network. Finally, using this finding, we\ndemonstrate that the effects of network mixing on ARE depend on the (cost)\neffectiveness of security measures available to agents; if the security\nmeasures are not effective, increasing assortativity of dependence graph\nresults in higher ARE. On the other hand, if the security measures are\neffective at fending off the damages and losses from attacks, increasing\nassortativity reduces the ARE experienced by agents.\n", "  As described in the work of Mietke et al. (1) the deformation (defined as 1 -\ncircularity [see (2)]) of a purely elastic, spherical object deformed in a\nreal-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) experiment can be mapped to its\napparent Young's Modulus. This note is supposed to help a fast and correct\nmapping of RT-DC results - namely, deformation and size - to values of the\napparent Young's Modulus E.\n", "  Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) is a lattice approach to quantum\ngravity. CDT has rich phase structure, including a semiclassical phase\nconsistent with Einstein's general relativity. Some of the observed phase\ntransitions are second (or higher) order which opens a possibility of\ninvestigating the ultraviolet continuum limit. Recently a new phase with\nintriguing geometric properties has been discovered and the new phase\ntransition is also second (or higher) order.\n", "  Presence of entangled states is explicitly shown in Topological insulator\n(TI) $Bi_2Te_3$. The surface and bulk state are found to have the different\nstructures of entanglement. The surface states live as maximally entangled\nstates in the four-dimensional subspace of total Hilbert space (spin, orbital,\nspace). However, bulk states are entangled in the whole Hilbert space. Bulk\nstates are found to be entangled maximally by controlled injection of electrons\nwith momentum only along the z-direction. Scheme to detect entanglement in a\n2-D model using measurement, confirming natural implementation of universal\nHadamard with Controlled-NOT gates is explicated.\n", "  The spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light has been intensively studied in\nnanophotonics because it enables sensitive control of photons' spin degree of\nfreedom and thereby the trajectory of the photons, which is useful for\napplications such as signal encoding and routing. A recent study showed that\nthe SOI of photons manifests in the presence of a gradient in the permittivity\nof the medium through which the photons propagate; this enhances the scattering\nof circularly polarized light and results in the photons propagating along\ntwisted trajectories. Here we theoretically predict that, because of the\nequivalence between an inhomogeneous dielectric medium and a gravitational\nfield demonstrated in transformation optics, a significant SOI is induced onto\ncircularly polarized light passing by the gravitational lens of a black hole.\nThis leads to: i) the photons to propagate along chiral trajectories if the\nsize of the blackhole is smaller than the wavelength of the incident photons,\nii) the resulting image of the gravitational lens to manifest an azimuthal\nrotation because of these chiral trajectories. The findings open for a way to\nprobe for and discover subwavelength-size black holes using circularly\npolarized light.\n", "  The problem of effective shear and bulk moduli, of an effective Poison's\nratio and of an effective dielectric response in microcomposites of the\nferroelastic-dielectric type was studied by us recently. Recently one of us, M.\nHudak, studied static mechanical properties of the EVA material theoretically\nand experimentally. We extend our mentioned study of mechanical response of\nmicrocomposites of the type ferrolastics - dielectrics to study of Young\nmodulus and shear wave velocity.\n", "  We propose a method to simulate the dynamics of spin-boson models with small\ncrystals of trapped ions where the electronic degree of freedom of one ion is\nused to encode the spin while the collective vibrational degrees of freedom are\nemployed to form an effective harmonic environment. The key idea of our\napproach is that a single damped mode can be used to provide a harmonic\nenvironment with Lorentzian spectral density. More complex spectral functions\ncan be tailored by combining several individually damped modes. We propose to\nwork with mixed-species crystals such that one species serves to encode the\nspin while the other species is used to cool the vibrational degrees of freedom\nto engineer the environment. The strength of the dissipation on the spin can be\ncontrolled by tuning the coupling between spin and vibrational degrees of\nfreedom. In this way the dynamics of spin-boson models with macroscopic and\nnon-Markovian environments can be simulated using only a few ions. We\nillustrate the approach by simulating an experiment with realistic parameters\nand show by computing quantitative measures that the dynamics is genuinely\nnon-Markovian.\n", "  Electric and magnetic properties of multiferroic GdMn2O5 in external magnetic\nfields were investigated to map out the magnetoelectric phases in this\nmaterial. Due to strong magnetoelectric coupling, the dielectric permittivity\nis highly sensitive to phase boundaries in GdMn2O5, which allowed to construct\nthe field-temperature phase diagrams. Several phase transitions are observed\nwhich are strongly field-dependent with respect to field orientation and\nstrength. The phase diagram for a magnetic field along the crystallographic\na-axis corresponds well to a polarization step, as induced by 90 degree\nrotation of Gd magnetic moments. Our results support the model of two\nferroelectric sublattices, Mn-Mn and Gd-Mn with strong R-Mn (4f-3d) interaction\nfor the polarization in RMn2O5.\n", "  In this work we follow a series of papers on high-resolution observations of\nsmall-scale structures in the solar atmosphere \\citep[][Cabello et al., in\nprep]{Balmaceda2009, Balmaceda2010, Vargas2011, Palacios2012, Domingo2012,\nVargas2015}, combining several multi-wavelength data series. These were\nacquired by both ground-based (SST) and space-borne (Hinode) instruments during\nthe joint campaign of the Hinode Operation Program 14, in September 2007.\nDiffraction-limited SST data were taken in the G-band and G-cont, and were\nrestored by the MFBD technique. Hinode instruments, on the other hand, provided\nmultispectral data from SOT-FG in the CN band, and Mg~{\\sc I} and Ca {\\sc\nII}~lines, as well as from SOT-SP in the Fe~{\\sc I} line. In this series of\nworks we have thoroughly studied vortex flows and their statistical\noccurrences, horizontal velocity fields by means of Local Correlation Tracking\n(LCT), divergence and vorticity. Taking advantage of the high-cadence and high\nspatial resolution data, we have also studied bright point statistics and\nmagnetic field intensification, highlighting the importance of the\nsmallest-scale magnetic element observations.\n", "  In the past 50 years, calorimeters have become the most important detectors\nin many particle physics experiments, especially experiments in colliding-beam\naccelerators at the energy frontier. In this paper, we describe and discuss a\nnumber of common misconceptions about these detectors, as well as the\nconsequences of these misconceptions. We hope that it may serve as a useful\nsource of information for young colleagues who want to familiarize themselves\nwith these tricky instruments.\n", "  In the free case, it is possible to define quantum fields which describe\nparticles with integer or half-integer spin larger than one. It is shown that\nparticles with integer spin must have Bose statistic and particles with\nhalf-integer-spin must follow Fermi-Dirac statistic. In the free case, the\nfields with spin smaller or equal to one are already well defined, so that for\nthem alone, the charge and energy density are clearly identified and gauge\ninvariant; while for the higher spin this is the case only for the total charge\nand total energy.\n", "  Recent work carried out in the SiD Consortium is reported. Results have been\nobtained with the Chronopix version 3 chip, intended for the SiD vertex\ndetector. A test structure is being produced for KPiXM, a CMOS MAPS approach\nthat could be used for the tracker and electromagnetic calorimeter. Tracker\nsensors are being tested and a new prototype sensor is being planned. A new\neffort on tracker support structures has begun and first prototypes produced.\nNew studies of the pair background envelope in the beam pipe have been carried\nout. Electromagnetic calorimeter testbeam data has been analysed and plans are\nbeing developed for a full stack prototype. New comprehensive studies of\nhigh-rate backgrounds and muons from the beam delivery system have been carried\nout to determine aspects of the forward region layout. Work has started on\nalignment and calibration strategies; and progress has been made on a new\nsimulation and reconstruction framework for SiD.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations of hadronic matrix elements allow one to draw\ninferences about quark flavor interactions from measurements of hadron decays.\nWithin the context of the Standard Model, the magnitude of the charm-bottom\nquark coupling $V_{cb}$ can be determined from semileptonic decays such as\n$B\\to D^{(*)}\\ell\\nu$. This brief review summarizes the present status and\nshort-term outlook for determining $|V_{cb}|$ using lattice QCD.\n", "  Flux emergence phenomena are relevant at different temporal and spatial\nscales. We have studied a flux emergence region underneath a filament. This\nfilament elevated itself smoothly, and the associated CME reached Earth. In\nthis study we investigate the size and amount of flux in the emergence event.\nThe flux emergence site appeared just beneath a filament. The emergence\nacquired a size of 24 Mm in half a day. The unsigned magnetic flux density from\nLOS-magnetograms is around 1 kG at its maximum. The transverse field as well as\nthe filament eruption were also analysed.\n", "  We present the first algorithm for finding holes in high dimensional data\nthat runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of dimensions. Previous\nalgorithms are exponential. Finding large empty rectangles or boxes in a set of\npoints in 2D and 3D space has been well studied. Efficient algorithms exist to\nidentify the empty regions in these low-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately such\nefficiency is lacking in higher dimensions where the problem has been shown to\nbe NP-complete when the dimensions are included in the input. Applications for\nalgorithms that find large empty spaces include big data analysis, recommender\nsystems, automated knowledge discovery, and query optimization. Our Monte\nCarlo-based algorithm discovers interesting maximal empty hyper-rectangles in\ncases where dimensionality and input size would otherwise make analysis\nimpractical. The run-time is polynomial in the size of the input and the number\nof dimensions. We apply the algorithm on a 39-dimensional data set for protein\nstructures and discover interesting properties that we think could not be\ninferred otherwise.\n", "  The Spanish Space Weather Service SeNMEs, \\url{www.senmes.es}, is a portal\ncreated by the SRG-SW of the Universidad de Alcal\\'a, Spain, to meet societal\nneeds of near real-time space weather services. This webpage-portal is divided\nin different sections to fulfill users needs about space weather effects: radio\nblackouts, solar energetic particle events, geomagnetic storms and presence of\ngeomagnetically induced currents. In less than one year of activity, this\nservice has released a daily report concerning the solar current status and\ninterplanetary medium, informing about the chances of a solar perturbation to\nhit the Earth's environment. There are also two different forecasting tools for\ngeomagnetic storms, and a daily ionospheric map. These tools allow us to\nnowcast a variety of solar eruptive events and forecast geomagnetic storms and\ntheir recovery, including a new local geomagnetic index, LDi{\\~n}, along with\nsome specific new scaling. In this paper we also include a case study analysed\nby SeNMEs. Using different high resolution and cadence data from space-borne\nsolar telescopes SDO, SOHO and GOES, along with ionospheric and geomagnetic\ndata, we describe the Sun-Earth feature chain for the event.\n", "  Filaments may be mistaken for coronal holes when observed in extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) images; however, a closer and more careful look reveals that\ntheir photometric properties are different. The combination of EUV images with\nphotospheric magnetograms shows some characteristic differences between\nfilaments and coronal holes. We have performed analyses with 7 different\nSDO/AIA wavelengths (94, 131, 171, 211, 193, 304, 335~\\AA) and SDO/HMI\nmagnetograms obtained in September 2011 and March 2012 to study coronal holes\nand filaments from the photometric, magnetic, and also geometric point of view,\nsince projection effects play an important role on the aforementioned traits.\n", "  Exposure of highly deuterated materials to a low-energy (nom. 2 MeV) photon\nbeam resulted in nuclear activity of both the parent metals of hafnium and\nerbium and a witness material (molybdenum) mixed with the reactants. Gamma\nspectral analysis of all deuterated materials, ErD2.8-C36D74-Mo and\nHfD2-C36D74-Mo, showed that nuclear processes had occurred as shown by unique\ngamma signatures. For the deuterated erbium specimens, posttest gamma spectra\nshowed evidence of radioisotopes of erbium (163Er and 171Er) and of molybdenum\n(99Mo and 101Mo) and by beta decay, technetium (99mTc and 101Tc). For the\ndeuterated hafnium specimens, posttest gamma spectra showed evidence of\nradioisotopes of hafnium (180mHf and 181Hf) and molybdenum (99Mo and 101Mo),\nand by beta decay, technetium (99mTc and 101Tc). In contrast, when either the\nhydrogenated or non-gas-loaded erbium or hafnium materials were exposed to the\ngamma flux, the gamma spectra revealed no new isotopes. Neutron activation\nmaterials showed evidence of thermal and epithermal neutrons. CR-39 solid-state\nnuclear track detectors showed evidence of fast neutrons with energies between\n1.4 and 2.5 MeV and several instances of triple tracks, indicating greater than\n10 MeV neutrons. Further study is required to determine the mechanism causing\nthe nuclear activity\n", "  Based on first-principles study, we report the finding of a new topological\nsemimetal LiBaBi in half-Heusler phase. The remarkable feature of this\nnonmagnetic, inversion-symmetry-breaking material is that it consists of only\nsimple $s$- and $p$-block elements. Interestingly, the material is ordinary\ninsulator in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and becomes nodal-surface\ntopological semimetal showing drumhead states when SOC is included. This is in\nstark contrast to other nodal-line and nodal-surface semimetals, where the\nextended nodal structure is destroyed once SOC is included. Importantly, the\nlinear band crossings host three-, four-, five- and six-fold degeneracies near\nthe Fermi level, making this compound very attractive for the study of\n`unconventional' fermions. The band crossing points form a three-dimensional\nnodal structure around the zone center at the Fermi level. We identify the\nsurface states responsible for the appearance of the drumhead states. The alloy\nalso shows a phase transition from topological semimetal to a trivial insulator\non application of pressure. In addition to revealing an intriguing effect of\nSOC on the nodal structure, our findings introduce a new half-Heusler alloy in\nthe family of topological semimetals, thus creating more avenues for\nexperimental exploration.\n", "  In a recent paper [arXiv:1506.06649 [nlin.CG]], we presented an example of a\n3-state cellular automaton which exhibits behaviour analogous to degenerate\nhyperbolicity often observed in finite-dimensional dynamical systems. We also\ncalculated densities of 0, 1 and 2 after n iterations of this rule, using\nfinite state machines to conjecture patterns present in preimage sets. Here, we\nre-derive the same formulae in a rigorous way, without resorting to any\nsemi-empirical methods. This is done by analysing the behaviour of continuous\nclusters of symbols and by considering their interactions.\n"]}
