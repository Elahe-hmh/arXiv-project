This approach,\ninspired in the Lie (super)algebra structure, is explicitly applied to the\nparticular case of (graded) contractions of the orthogonal real algebra\n${\\mathfrak{so}}(N+1)$. In this way we show that \"classical\" contraction\nparameters which appear in the commutation relations of the contracted Lie\nalgebras, become quantum deformation parameters, arising as entries of the\nresulting quantum $R$-matrices.\n", "  Two-dimensional problem of evanescent wave scattering by dielectric or\nmetallic cylinders near the interface between two dielectric media is solved\nnumerically by boundary integral equations method. A special Green function was\nproposed to avoid the infinite integration. A pattern with a circular and a\nprolate elliptic cylinders, respectively, is suggested to simulate the sample\nand the probe in near-field optical microscopy. The energy flux in the midplane\nof the probe-cylinder is calculated as a function of its position.\n", "  We construct the membrane paradigm for black objects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity in spacetime dimensions $ \\ge 5$. As in the case of general relativity,\nthe horizon can be modeled as a membrane endowed with fluidlike properties. We\nderive the stress tensor for this membrane fluid and study the perturbation\naround static backgrounds with constant curvature horizon cross section, for\nwhich the stress tensor can be regularized with the usual redshift factor, and\nexpressed in the form of a Newtonian viscous fluid with pressure, shear\nviscosity and bulk viscosity. We evaluate the transport coefficients for black\nholes with constant curvature horizons and negative or zero cosmological\nconstant. For the black brane geometry our result for the ratio of shear\nviscosity to entropy density agrees with that obtained previously in different\nframeworks.\n", "  The scattering of electromagnetic wave by a periodic array of nanowires is\ncalculated by the boundary element method. The method is extended to the\ninfinite grating near the interface between two dielectrics. A special Green\nfunction is derived that allows to study the evanescent wave. The Rayleigh---\nWood's anomalies are found in the period-to-wavelength dependence of the\naverage Pointing vector in the wave zone. For thin wires the calculations are\nshown to agree with the two-dimensional coupled dipole approximation.\n", "  This paper presents bifurcation and generalized bifurcation diagrams for a\nrotational model of an oblate satellite. Special attention is paid to parameter\nvalues describing one of Saturn's moons, Hyperion. For various oblateness the\nlargest Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent (LCE) is plotted. The largest LCE in\nthe initial condition as well as in the mixed parameter-initial condition space\nexhibits a fractal structure, for which the fractal dimension was calculated.\nIt results from the bifurcation diagrams of which most of the parameter values\nfor preselected initial conditions lead to chaotic rotation. The First\nRecurrence Time (FRT) diagram provides an explanation of the birth of chaos and\nthe existence of quasi-periodic windows occuring in the bifurcation diagrams.\n", "  This paper presents the analysis of ionospheric effects in the region close\nto the Chelyabinsk meteorite explosion at 03:20UT 2013 February 15 from the\nInstitute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of\nSciences (ISTP SB RAS) EKB radar data, and from the Institute of Geophysics of\nUral Branch of Russian Academy of Sciences (IG UB RAS) PARUS ionosonde data.\nBoth instruments are located within the IG UB RAS Arti Observatory\napproximately 200 km northward from the estimated explosion site. According to\nthe data obtained, the ionospheric disturbance caused by the meteorite flyby,\nexplosion, and impact had high dynamics and amplitude. However, it obviously\ndid not lead to a variation in the ionosphere mean parameters in the region\nabove the disturbance center during the first 2 hours. Essential effects,\nhowever, were observed at more than 100-200 km from the explosion site and\nfarther up to 1500 km.\n", "  We experimentally generate speckle patterns with non-Rayleigh intensity\nstatistics using a phase-only spatial light modulator. By introducing high\norder correlations to the input light fields we redistribute the intensity\namong the speckle grains, while preserving the granular structure of the\npattern. Our method is versatile and allows for generating speckle patterns\nwith enhanced or diminished contrast in a controlled manner.\n", "  It is shown that the description of certain class of representations of the\nholonomy Lie algebra associated to hyperplane arrangement $\\Delta$ is\nessentially equivalent to the classification of $\\vee$-systems associated to\n$\\Delta.$ The flat sections of the corresponding $\\vee$-connection can be\ninterpreted as vector fields, which are both logarithmic and gradient. We\nconjecture that the hyperplane arrangement of any $\\vee$-system is free in\nSaito's sense and show this for all known $\\vee$-systems and for a special\nclass of $\\vee$-systems called harmonic, which includes all Coxeter systems. In\nthe irreducible Coxeter case the potentials of the corresponding gradient\nvector fields turn out to be Saito flat coordinates, or their one-parameter\ndeformations. We give formulas for these deformations as well as for the\npotentials of the classical families of harmonic $\\vee$-systems.\n", "  These lecture notes give a brief introduction to heavy fermion physics,\nemphasizing aspects of particular modern interest. Following an introduction to\nthe Kondo effect and the phenomenology of heavy fermions, the article\nintroduces Kondo insulators, the simplest heavy fermions; the large N expansion\nfor the Kondo lattice; heavy fermion superconductivity including the symplectic\nN approach; topological Kondo insulators and finally a discussion of the\nchallenge of understanding the co-existence of magnetism and the Kondo effect.\n", "  The top quark pair production cross section is measured for the first time in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN\nLHC, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 43 inverse\npicobarns. The measurement is performed by analyzing events with at least one\nelectron and one muon of opposite charge, and at least two jets. The measured\ncross section is 746 +/- 58 (stat) +/- 53 (syst) +/- 36 (lumi) pb, in agreement\nwith the expectation from the standard model.\n", "  We give fully explicit upper and lower bounds for the constants in two known\ninequalities related to the quadratic nonlinearity of the incompressible (Euler\nor) Navier-Stokes equations on the torus T^d. These inequalities are \"tame\"\ngeneralizations (in the sense of Nash-Moser) of the ones analyzed in the\nprevious works [Morosi and Pizzocchero: CPAA 2012, Appl.Math.Lett. 2013].\n", "  In this paper, we explore the role of network topology on maintaining the\nextensive property of entropy. We study analytically and numerically how the\ntopology contributes to maintaining extensivity of entropy in multiplex\nnetworks, i.e. networks of subnetworks (layers), by means of the sum of the\npositive Lyapunov exponents, $H_{KS}$, a quantity related to entropy. We show\nthat extensivity relies not only on the interplay between the coupling\nstrengths of the dynamics associated to the intra (short-range) and inter\n(long-range) interactions, but also on the sum of the intra-degrees of the\nnodes of the layers. For the analytically treated networks of size $N$, among\nseveral other results, we show that if the sum of the intra-degrees (and the\nsum of inter-degrees) scales as $N^{\\theta+1},\\;\\theta>0$, extensivity can be\nmaintained if the intra-coupling (and the inter-coupling) strength scales as\n$N^{-\\theta}$, when evolution is driven by the maximisation of $H_{KS}$. We\nthen verify our analytical results by performing numerical simulations in\nmultiplex networks formed by electrically and chemically coupled neurons.\n", "  Uniform and large area synthesis of bulk insulating ultrathin films is an\nimportant subject toward applications of a surface of three dimensional\ntopological insulators (3D-TIs) in various electronic devices. Here we report\nepitaxial growth of bulk insulating three dimensional topological insulator\n(3D-TI) Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey (BSTS) ultrathin films, ranging from a few quintuple\nto several hundreds of layaers, on mica in a large-area (1 cm2) via catalyst\nfree physical vapor deposition. These films can nondestructively be exfoliated\nusing deionized water and transferred to various kinds of substrates as\ndesired. The transferred BSTS thin films show good ambipolar characteristics as\nwell as well defined quantum oscillations arising from the topological surface\nstates. Carrier mobility of 2500-5100 cm2(Vs)-1 is comparable to the high\nquality bulk BSTS single crystal. Moreover, tunable electronic states from the\nmassless to the massive Dirac fermion were observed with a decrease in the film\nthickness. Both the feasible large area synthesis and the reliable film\ntransfer process can promise that BSTS ultrathin films will pave a route to\nmany applications of 3D-TIs.\n", "  The calculation of the equilibrium optical properties of bulk silicon by\nusing the Bethe--Salpeter equation solved in the Kohn--Sham basis represents a\ncornerstone in the development of an ab--initio approach to the optical and\nelectronic properties of materials. Nevertheless calculations of the {\\em\ntransient} optical spectrum using the same efficient and successful scheme are\nscarce. We report, here, a joint theoretical and experimental study of the\ntransient reflectivity spectrum of bulk silicon. Femtosecond transient\nreflectivity is compared to a parameter--free calculation based on the\nnon--equilibrium Bethe--Salpeter equation. By providing an accurate description\nof the experimental results we disclose the different phenomena that determine\nthe transient optical response of a semiconductor. We give a parameter--free\ninterpretation of concepts like bleaching, photo--induced absorption and\nstimulated emission, beyond the Fermi golden rule. We also introduce the\nconcept of optical gap renormalization, as a generalization of the known\nmechanism of band gap renormalization. The present scheme successfully\ndescribes the case of bulk silicon, showing its universality and accuracy.\n", "  Many studies have explored spreading and diffusion through complex networks.\nThe following study examines a specific case of spreading of opinions in modern\nsociety through two spreading schemes, defined as being either through\nword-of-mouth (WOM), or through online search engines (WEB). We apply both\nmodelling and real experimental results and compare the opinions people adopt\nthrough an exposure to their friend`s opinions, as opposed to the opinions they\nadopt when using a search engine based on the PageRank algorithm. A simulated\nstudy shows that when members in a population adopt decisions through the use\nof the WEB scheme, the population ends up with a few dominant views, while\nother views are barely expressed. In contrast, when members adopt decisions\nbased on the WOM scheme, there is a far more diverse distribution of opinions\nin that population. The simulative results are further supported by an online\nexperiment which finds that people searching information through a search\nengine end up with far more homogenous opinions as compared to those asking\ntheir friends.\n", "  We consider the problem of learning the underlying graph of an unknown Ising\nmodel on p spins from a collection of i.i.d. samples generated from the model.\nWe suggest a new estimator that is computationally efficient and requires a\nnumber of samples that is near-optimal with respect to previously established\ninformation-theoretic lower-bound. Our statistical estimator has a physical\ninterpretation in terms of \"interaction screening\". The estimator is consistent\nand is efficiently implemented using convex optimization. We prove that with\nappropriate regularization, the estimator recovers the underlying graph using a\nnumber of samples that is logarithmic in the system size p and exponential in\nthe maximum coupling-intensity and maximum node-degree.\n", "  Quantum coherence is the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. The\nusual understanding of it depends on the choice of the basis, that is, the\ncoherence of the same quantum state is different within different reference\nframework. To reveal all the potential coherence, we present the total quantum\ncoherence measures in terms of two different methods. One is optimizing maximal\nbasis-dependent coherence with all potential bases considered and the other is\nquantifying the distance between the state and the incoherent state set.\nInterestingly, the coherence measures based on relative entropy and $l_2$ norm\nhave the same form in the two different methods. In particular, we show that\nthe measures based on the non-contractive $l_2$ norm is also a good measure\ndifferent from the basis-dependent coherence. In addition, we show that all the\nmeasures are analytically calculable and have all the good properties. The\nexperimental schemes for the detection of these coherence measures are also\nproposed by multiple copies of quantum states instead of reconstructing the\nfull density matrix. By studying one type of quantum probing schemes, we find\nthat both the normalized trace in the scheme of deterministic quantum\ncomputation with one qubit (DQC1) and the overlap of two states in quantum\noverlap measurement schemes (QOM) can be well described by the change of total\ncoherence of the probing qubit. Hence the nontrivial probing always leads to\nthe change of the total coherence.\n", "  We utilize quantum superposition principle to establish the improvable upper\nand lower bounds on the stronger uncertainty relation, i.e., the\n\"weighted-like\" sum of the variances of observables. Our bounds include some\nfree parameters which not only guarantee the nontrivial bounds but also can\neffectively control the bounds as tightly as one expects. Especially, these\nparameters don't obviously depend on the state and observables. It also implies\none advantage of our method that any nontrivial bound can always be more\nimprovable. In addition, we generalize both bounds to the uncertainty relation\nwith multiple observables, but the perfect tightness is not changed. Examples\nare given to illustrate the improvability of our bounds in each case.\n", "  Semiconductors are by now well-established targets for direct detection of\nMeV to GeV dark matter via scattering off electrons. We show that semiconductor\ntargets can also detect significantly lighter dark matter via an absorption\nprocess. When the dark matter mass is above the band gap of the semiconductor\n(around an eV), absorption proceeds by excitation of an electron into the\nconduction band. Below the band gap, multi-phonon excitations enable absorption\nof dark matter in the 0.01 eV to eV mass range. Energetic dark matter particles\nemitted from the sun can also be probed for masses below an eV. We derive the\nreach for absorption of a relic kinetically mixed dark photon or pseudoscalar\nin germanium and silicon, and show that existing direct detection results\nalready probe new parameter space. With only a moderate exposure, low-threshold\nsemiconductor target experiments can exceed current astrophysical and\nterrestrial constraints on sub-keV bosonic dark matter.\n", "  I discuss the elliptic flows of $\\psi(2S)$ with different production\nmechanisms in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions. If the final\n$\\psi(2S)$s are mainly from the recombination of uncorrelated charm and\nanticharm quarks at $T\\approx T_c$, charm and anticharm quarks will carry large\ncollective flows of the bulk medium, which will be inherited by the regenerated\n$\\psi(2S)$s. This indicates a larger elliptic flow of $\\psi(2S)$ than that of\n$J/\\psi$ which can be regenerated at $T\\ge T_c$, $v_2^{\\psi(2S)}>v_2^{J/\\psi}$.\nHowever, if the final $\\psi(2S)$s are mainly from the transitions of\n$J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)$ caused by the color screening of QGP, its elliptic\nflow should be close to the elliptic flow of $J/\\psi$, $v_2^{\\psi(2S)}\\sim\nv_2^{J/\\psi}$. Therefore, $\\psi(2S)$ elliptic flow is a sensitive probe for its\nproduction mechanisms in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Metrics derived from Twitter and other social media---often referred to as\naltmetrics---are increasingly used to estimate the broader social impacts of\nscholarship. Such efforts, however, may produce highly misleading results, as\nthe entities that participate in conversations about science on these platforms\nare largely unknown. For instance, if altmetric activities are generated mainly\nby scientists, does it really capture broader social impacts of science? Here\nwe present a systematic approach to identifying and analyzing scientists on\nTwitter. Our method can identify scientists across many disciplines, without\nrelying on external bibliographic data, and be easily adapted to identify other\nstakeholder groups in science. We investigate the demographics, sharing\nbehaviors, and interconnectivity of the identified scientists. We find that\nTwitter has been employed by scholars across the disciplinary spectrum, with an\nover-representation of social and computer and information scientists;\nunder-representation of mathematical, physical, and life scientists; and a\nbetter representation of women compared to scholarly publishing. Analysis of\nthe sharing of URLs reveals a distinct imprint of scholarly sites, yet only a\nsmall fraction of shared URLs are science-related. We find an assortative\nmixing with respect to disciplines in the networks between scientists,\nsuggesting the maintenance of disciplinary walls in social media. Our work\ncontributes to the literature both methodologically and conceptually---we\nprovide new methods for disambiguating and identifying particular actors on\nsocial media and describing the behaviors of scientists, thus providing\nfoundational information for the construction and use of indicators on the\nbasis of social media metrics.\n", "  We present a method for calculation of statistical correlations between\nmeasured jet observables in high energy collisions. The method is compared to\nsampling based methods used in the past. The case of measurements of jet rates\nin $e^+e^-$ collisions is considered in detail.\n", "  Based on the Irkutsk fast monostatic chirp ionosonde data we made a\nstatistical analysis of ionospheric effects for 28 earthquakes which appeared\nin 2011-2016 years. These effects are related with surface (Rayleigh) seismic\nwaves far from epicenter. The analysis has shown that nine of these earthquakes\nwere accompanied by vertical midscale ionospheric irregularities (multicusp).\nTo estimate the ionospheric efficiency of the seismic waves we proposed new\nindex $K_{W}$. The index estimates the maximal amplitude of the acoustic shock\nwave generated by given spatial distribution of seismic vibrations and related\nwith maximal spectral power of seismic oscillations.\n  Based on the analysis of experimental data we have shown that\nearthquake-related multicusp is observed mostly at daytime [07:00-17:00]LST for\n$K_{W}\\ge4.7$. The observations of intrinsic gravity waves by GPS technique in\nthe epicenter vicinity do not show such a daytime dependence. Based on\n24/05/2013 Okhotsk Sea earthquake example, we demonstrated that deep-focus\nearthquakes can produce strong multicusp far from the epicenter, although do\nnot produce significant GPS ionospheric response in the epicenter vicinity.\nThree cases of sporadic E bifurcation in far epicentral zone were also detected\nand discussed.\n", "  The soft diffraction phenomena in the elastic proton-proton scattering are\nreviewed from the viewpoint of experiments at the LHC (TOTEM and ATLAS\ncollaboration). In the framework of the High Energy Generalized Structure\n(HEGS) model the form of the diffraction minimum in the nucleon-nucleon elastic\nscattering in a wide energy region is analyzed. The energy dependences of the\nmain characteristics of the diffraction dip are obtained. The numerical\npredictions at LHC energies are presented. The comparison of the model\npredictions with the new LHC data at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV is made.\n", "  By means of hybrid multi-particle collsion--particle-in-cell (MPC-PIC)\nsimulations we study the dynamical scaling of energy and density correlations\nat equilibrium in moderately coupled 2D and quasi 1D plasmas. We find that the\npredictions of Nonlinear Fluctuating Hydrodynamics for the structure factors of\ndensity and energy fluctuations in 1D systems with three global conservation\nlaws hold true also for two dimensional systems that are more extended along\none of the two spatial dimensions. Moreover, from the analysis of the\nequilibrium energy correlators and density structure factors of both 1D and 2D\nneutral plasmas, we find that neglecting the contribution of the fluctuations\nof the vanishing self-consistent electrostatic fields overestimates the\ninterval of frequencies over which the anomalous transport is observed. Such\nviolations of the expected scaling in the currents correlation are found in\ndifferent regimes, hindering the observation of the asymptotic scaling\npredicted by the theory.\n", "  We exploit the 1+1+2 formalism to covariantly describe the inhomogeneous and\nanisotropic Szekeres models. It is shown that an \\emph{average scale length}\ncan be defined \\emph{covariantly} which satisfies a 2d equation of motion\ndriven from the \\emph{effective gravitational mass} (EGM) contained in the dust\ncloud. The contributions to the EGM are encoded to the energy density of the\ndust fluid and the free gravitational field $E_{ab}$. We show that the\nquasi-symmetric property of the Szekeres models is justified through the\nexistence of 3 independent \\emph{Intrinsic Killing Vector Fields (IKVFs)}. In\naddition the notions of the Apparent and Absolute Apparent Horizons are briefly\ndiscussed and we give an alternative gauge-invariant form to define them in\nterms of the kinematical variables of the spacelike congruences. We argue that\nthe proposed program can be used in order to express Sachs' optical equations\nin a covariant form and analyze the confrontation of a spatially inhomogeneous\nirrotational overdense fluid model with the observational data.\n", "  We present an analysis of citations accrued over time by patents granted by\nthe United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1998. In contrast to previous\nstudies, a disaggregation by technology category is performed, and exogenously\ncaused citation-number growth is controlled for. Our approach reveals an\nintrinsic citation rate that clearly separates into an -- in the long run,\nexponentially time-dependent -- ageing function and a completely\ntime-independent preferential-attachment-type growth kernel. For the general\ncase of such a separable citation rate, we obtain the time-dependent citation\ndistribution analytically in a form that is valid for any functional form of\nits ageing and growth parts. Good agreement between theory and long-time\ncharacteristics of patent-citation data establishes our work as a useful\nframework for addressing still open questions about knowledge-propagation\ndynamics, such as the observed excess of citations at short times.\n", "  We use state-of-art measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at\nz=6, 7 and 8 to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM), late-forming dark\nmatter (LFDM) and ultra-light axion dark matter (ULADM) models alternative to\nthe cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. To this purpose we have run a suite of\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations to accurately characterise the low mass-end\nof the halo mass function and derive DM model predictions of the high-z\nluminosity function. In order to convert halo masses into UV-magnitudes we\nintroduce an empirical approach based on halo abundance matching which allows\nus to model the LF in terms of the amplitude and scatter of the ensemble\naverage star formation rate halo mass relation of each DM model, $\\langle {\\rm\nSFR}({\\rm M_{ h}},z)\\rangle$. We find that independent of the DM scenario the\naverage SFR at fixed halo mass increases from z=6 to 8, while the scatter\nremains constant. At halo mass ${\\rm M_{h}}\\gtrsim 10^{12}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nh$^{-1}$ the average SFR as function of halo mass follows a double power law\ntrend that is common to all models, while differences occur at smaller masses.\nIn particular, we find that models with a suppressed low-mass halo abundance\nexhibit higher SFR compared to the CDM results. Using deviance statistics we\nobtain a lower limit on the WDM thermal relic particle mass, $m_{\\rm\nWDM}\\gtrsim 1.5$ keV at $2\\sigma$. In the case of LFDM models, the phase\ntransition redshift parameter is bounded to $z_t\\gtrsim 8\\cdot 10^5$ at\n$2\\sigma$. We find ULADM best-fit models with axion mass $m_a\\gtrsim 1.6\\cdot\n10^{-22}$ eV to be well within $2\\sigma$ of the deviance statistics. We remark\nthat measurements at $z=6$ slightly favour a flattening of the LF at faint\nUV-magnitudes. This tends to prefer some of the non-CDM models in our\nsimulation suite, although not at a statistically significant level to\ndistinguish them from CDM.\n", "  We consider a novel cosmological scenario in which a curvaton is long-lived\nand plays the role of cold dark matter (CDM) in the presence of a short,\nsecondary inflation. Non-trivial evolution of the large scale cosmological\nperturbation in the curvaton scenario can affect the duration of the short term\ninflation, resulting in the inhomogeneous end of inflation. Non-linear\nparameters of the curvature perturbation are predicted to be fNL ~ 5/4 and gNL\n~ 0. The curvaton abundance can be well diluted by the short-term inflation and\naccordingly, it does not have to decay into the Standard Model particles. Then\nthe curvaton can account for the present CDM with the isocurvature perturbation\nbeing sufficiently suppressed because both the adiabatic and CDM isocurvature\nperturbations have the same origin. As an explicit example, we consider the\nthermal inflation scenario and a string axion as a candidate for this\ncurvaton-dark matter. We further discuss possibilities to identify the\ncurvaton-dark matter with the QCD axion.\n", "  We report an unexpected behavior in wetting dynamics on soft silicone\nsubstrates: the dynamics of aqueous droplets deposited on vertical plates of\nsuch elastomers exhibits two successive speed regimes. This macroscopic\nobservation is found to be closely related to microscopic phenomena occurring\nat the scale of the polymer network: we show that uncrosslinked chains found in\nmost widely used commercial silicone elastomers are responsible for this\nsurprising behavior. A direct visualization of the uncrosslinked oligomers\ncollected by water droplets is performed, evidencing that a capillarity-induced\nphase separation occurs: uncrosslinked oligomers are extracted from the\nsilicone elastomer network by the water-glycerol mixture droplet. The sharp\nspeed change is shown to coincide with an abrupt transition in surface tension\nof the droplets, when a critical surface concentration in uncrosslinked\noligomer chains is reached. We infer that a droplet shifts to a second regime\nwith a faster speed when it is completely covered with a homogeneous oil film.\n", "  We study interacting bosonic or fermionic atoms in a high synthetic magnetic\nfield in two dimensions spanned by continuous real space and a synthetic\ndimension. Here, the synthetic dimension is provided by hyperfine spin states,\nand the synthetic field is created by laser-induced transitions between them.\nWhile the interaction is short-range in real space, it is long-range in the\nsynthetic dimension in sharp contrast with fractional quantum Hall systems.\nIntroducing an analog of the lowest-Landau-level approximation valid for large\ntransition amplitudes, we derive an effective one-dimensional lattice model, in\nwhich density-density interactions turn out to play a dominant role. We show\nthat in the limit of a large number of internal states, the system exhibits a\ncascade of crystal ground states, which is known as devil's staircase, in a way\nanalogous to the thin-torus limit of quantum Hall systems.\n", "  Simplified models of transport in mesoscopic systems are often based on a\nsmall sample connected to a finite number of leads. The leads are often\nmodelled using the Laplacian on the discrete half-line $\\mathbb N$. Detailed\nstudies of the transport near thresholds require detailed information on the\nresolvent of the Laplacian on the discrete half-line. This paper presents a\ncomplete study of threshold resonance states and resolvent expansions at a\nthreshold for the Schr\\\"odinger operator on the discrete half-line $\\mathbb N$\nwith a general boundary condition. A precise description of the expansion\ncoefficients reveals their exact correspondence to the generalized eigenspaces,\nor the threshold types. The presentation of the paper is adapted from that of\nIto-Jensen [Rev.\\ Math.\\ Phys.\\ {\\bf 27} (2015), 1550002 (45 pages)],\nimplementing the expansion scheme of Jensen-Nenciu [Rev.\\ Math.\\ Phys.\\\n\\textbf{13} (2001), 717--754, \\textbf{16} (2004), 675--677] in its full\ngenerality.\n", "  Hypergraph states form a family of multiparticle quantum states that\ngeneralizes cluster states and graph states. We study the action and graphical\nrepresentation of nonlocal unitary transformations between hypergraph states.\nThis leads to a generalization of local complementation and graphical rules for\nvarious gates, such as the CNOT gate and the Toffoli gate. As an application,\nwe show that already for five qubits local Pauli operations are not sufficient\nto check local equivalence of hypergraph states. Furthermore, we use our rules\nto construct entanglement witnesses for three-uniform hypergraph states.\n", "  A double rephasing photon echo is analyzed for inversion-free photon\necho-based quantum memories using controlled Rabi flopping, where the Rabi\nflopping is used for phase control of atom coherence. Unlike the\nrephasing-caused pi-phase shift in a single rephasing scheme, the control Rabi\nflopping between the excited state and an auxiliary third state induces\ncoherence inversion. Thus, the absorptive photon echo in a double rephasing\nscheme can be manipulated to be emissive via the controlled Rabi flopping. Here\nwe present a quantum coherence control of atom phases in a double rephasing\nphoton echo scheme for emissive photon echoes for quantum memory applications.\n", "  We investigate light-curve and spectral properties of ultra-stripped\ncore-collapse supernovae. Ultra-stripped supernovae are the explosions of\nheavily stripped massive stars which lost their envelopes via binary\ninteractions with a compact companion star. They eject only ~ 0.1 Msun and may\nbe the main way to form double neutron-star systems which eventually merge\nemitting strong gravitational waves. We follow the evolution of an\nultra-stripped supernova progenitor until iron core collapse and perform\nexplosive nucleosynthesis calculations. We then synthesize light curves and\nspectra of ultra-stripped supernovae using the nucleosynthesis results and\npresent their expected properties. Ultra-stripped supernovae synthesize ~ 0.01\nMsun of radioactive 56Ni, and their typical peak luminosity is around 1e42\nerg/s or -16 mag. Their typical rise time is 5 - 10 days. Comparing synthesized\nand observed spectra, we find that SN 2005ek, some of the so-called\ncalcium-rich gap transients, and SN 2010X may be related to ultra-stripped\nsupernovae. If these supernovae are actually ultra-stripped supernovae, their\nevent rate is expected to be about 1 per cent of core-collapse supernovae.\nComparing the double neutron-star merger rate obtained by future\ngravitational-wave observations and the ultra-stripped supernova rate obtained\nby optical transient surveys identified with our synthesized light-curve and\nspectral models, we will be able to judge whether ultra-stripped supernovae are\nactually a major contributor to the binary neutron star population and provide\nconstraints on binary stellar evolution.\n", "  Many Type Ic superluminous supernovae have light-curve decline rates after\ntheir luminosity peak which are close to the nuclear decay rate of 56Co,\nconsistent with the interpretation that they are powered by 56Ni and possibly\npair-instability supernovae. However, their rise times are typically shorter\nthan those expected from pair-instability supernovae, and Type Ic superluminous\nsupernovae are often suggested to be powered by magnetar spin-down. If magnetar\nspin-down is actually a major mechanism to power Type Ic superluminous\nsupernovae, it should be able to produce decline rates similar to the 56Co\ndecay rate rather easily. In this study, we investigate the conditions for\nmagnetars under which their spin-down energy input can behave like the 56Ni\nnuclear decay energy input. We find that an initial magnetic field strength\nwithin a certain range is sufficient to keep the magnetar energy deposition\nwithin a factor of a few of the 56Co decay energy for several hundreds of days.\nMagnetar spin-down needs to be by almost pure dipole radiation with the braking\nindex close to 3 to mimic 56Ni in a wide parameter range. Not only late-phase\n56Co-decay-like light curves, but also rise time and peak luminosity of most\n56Ni-powered light curves can be reproduced by magnetars. Bolometric light\ncurves for more than 700 days are required to distinguish the two energy\nsources solely by them. We expect that more slowly-declining superluminous\nsupernovae with short rise times should be found if they are mainly powered by\nmagnetar spin-down.\n", "  We study the relationship between the collective phenomena of super and\nsubradiance and spontaneous synchronization of quantum systems. To this aim we\nrevisit the case of two detuned qubits interacting through a pure dissipative\nbosonic environment, which contains the minimal ingredients for our analysis.\nBy using the Liouville formalism, we are able to find analytically the ultimate\nconnection between these phenomena. We find that dynamical synchronization is\ndue to the presence of long standing coherence between the ground state of the\nsystem and the subradiant state. We finally show that, under pure dissipation,\nthe emergence of spontaneous synchronization and of subradiant emission occur\non the same time scale. This reciprocity is broken in the presence of dephasing\nnoise.\n", "  Based on the Kirchhoff-Fresnel approximation, we consider behavior of the\noptical vortices (OV) upon propagation of the diffracted Laguerre-Gaussian (LG)\nbeams with topological charge |m| = 1, 2. Under conditions of weak diffraction\nperturbation (i.e. the diffraction obstacle covers only the far transverse\nperiphery of the incident LG beam), the OVs describe almost perfect 3D spirals\nwithin the diffracted beam body, which is an impressive demonstration of the\nhelical nature of an OV beam. The far-field OV positions within the diffracted\nbeam cross section depend on the wavefront curvature of the incident OV beam so\nthat the input wavefront curvature is transformed into the output azimuthal OV\nrotation. The results can be useful in the OV metrology and for the OV beam's\ndiagnostics.\n", "  In the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen experiment, when Alice makes a measurement\non her part of a bipartite system, Bob's part is collapsed to, or steered to, a\nspecific ensemble. Moreover, by reading her measurement outcome, Alice can\nspecify which state in the ensemble Bob's system is steered to and with which\nprobability. The possible states that Alice can steer Bob's system to are\ncalled steered states. In this work, we study the subset of steered states\nwhich are pure after normalisation. We illustrate that these pure steered\nstates, if they exist, often carry interesting information about the shared\nbipartite state. This information content becomes particularly clear when we\nstudy the purification of the shared state. Some applications are discussed.\nThese include a generalisation of the fundamental lemma in the so-called\n`all-versus-nothing proof of steerability' for systems of arbitrary dimension.\n", "  We show that the $B-L$ Supersymmetric Standard Model with Inverse Seesaw\n(BLSSMIS) provides new Dark Matter (DM) candidates (lightest right-handed\nsneutrino and lightest $B-L$ neutralino) with mass of order few hundreds GeV,\nwhile most of other SUSY spectrum can be quite heavy, consistently with the\ncurrent Large Hadron Collider (LHC) constraints. We emphasize that the thermal\nrelic abundance and direct detection experiments via relic neutralino\nscattering with nuclei impose stringent constraints on the $B-L$ neutralinos.\nThese constraints can be satisfied by few points in the parameter space where\nthe $B-L$ lightest neutralino is higgsino-like, which cannot explain the\nobserved Galactic Center (GC) gamma-ray excess measured by Fermi-LAT. The\nlightest right-handed sneutrino DM is analysed. We show that for a wide region\nof parameter space the lightest right-handed sneutrino, with mass between 80\nGeV and 1.2 TeV, can satisfy the limits of the relic abundance and the\nscattering cross with nuclei. We also show that the lightest right-handed\nsneutrino with mass ${\\cal O}(100)$ GeV can account for the observed GC\ngamma-ray results.\n", "  We calculate the temperature dependent long-range magnetic coupling in the\npresence of dilute concentrations of random magnetic impurities in chiral\nmultilayer two-dimensional semimetals, i.e., undoped intrinsic multilayer\ngraphene. Assuming a carrier-mediated indirect RKKY exchange interaction among\nthe well-separated magnetic impurities with the itinerant carriers mediating\nthe magnetic interaction between the impurities, we investigate the magnetic\nproperties of intrinsic multilayer graphene using an effective chiral\nHamiltonian model. We find that due to the enhanced density of states in the\nrhombohedral stacking sequence of graphene layers, the magnetic ordering of\nmultilayer graphene is ferromagnetic in the continuum limit. The ferromagnetic\ntransition temperature is calculated using a finite-temperature self-consistent\nfield approximation and found to be within the experimentally accessible range\nfor reasonable values of the impurity-carrier coupling.\n", "  We investigate mass transfer and the formation of disc in binary systems\nusing a combination of numerical simulations and theory. We consider six models\ndistinguished by binary separation, secondary mass and outflow mechanisms. Each\nsystem consists of an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star and an accreting\nsecondary. The AGB star loses its mass via a wind. In one of our six models,\nthe AGB star incurs a short period of outburst. In all cases, the secondary\naccretes part of the ejected mass and also influences the mass-loss rate of the\nAGB star. The ejected mass may remain gravitationally bound to the binary\nsystem and form a circumbinary disk, or contribute to an accretion disk around\nthe secondary. In other cases, the ejecta will escape the binary system. The\naccretion rate on to the secondary changes non-linearly with binary separation.\nIn our closest binary simulations, our models exemplify the wind Roche lobe\noverflow while in our wide binary cases, the mass transfer exhibits Bondi-Hoyle\naccretion. The morphologies of the outflows in the binary systems are varied.\nThe variety may provide clues to how the late AGB phase influences planetary\nnebulae shaping. We employ the adaptive-mesh-refinement code ASTROBEAR for our\nsimulations and include ray-tracing, radiation transfer, cooling and dust\nformation. To attain the highest computational efficiency and the most stable\nresults, all simulations are run in the corotating frame.\n", "  The limit on the intrinsic brightness temperature, attributed to `Compton\ncatastrophe', has been established being $10^{12}$~K. Somewhat lower limit of\nthe order of $10^{11.5}$~K is implied if we assume that the radiating plasma is\nin equipartition with the magnetic field --- the idea that explained why the\nobserved cores of active galactic nuclei sustained the limit lower than the\n`Compton catastrophe'. Recent observations with unprecedented high resolution\nby the RADIOASTRON revealed systematic exceed in the observed brightness\ntemperature. We propose means of estimating the degree of non-equipartition\nregime in AGN cores. Coupled with the core-shift measurements the method allows\nus to estimate independently the magnetic field strength and the particles\nnumber density at the core. We show that the ratio of magnetic energy to\nradiating plasma energy is of the order of $10^{-5}$, which means the flow in\nthe core is dominated by the particle energy. We show that the magnetic field\nobtained by the brightness temperature measurements may be underestimated. We\npropose for the relativistic jets with small viewing angles the non-uniform MHD\nmodel, and obtain the expression for the magnetic field amplitude about two\norders higher than that for the uniform model. These magnetic field amplitudes\nare consistent with the limiting magnetic field suggested by the `magnetically\narrested disk' model.\n", "  An alternative for the construction of fundamental theories is the\nintroduction of Galileons. These are fields whose action leads to non higher\nthan second-order equations of motion. As this is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition to make the Hamiltonian bounded from below, as long as the\naction is not degenerate, the Galileon construction is a way to avoid\npathologies both at the classical and quantum levels. Galileon actions are,\ntherefore, of great interest in many branches of physics, specially in high\nenergy physics and cosmology. This proceedings contribution presents the\ngeneralities of the construction of both scalar and vector Galileons following\ntwo different but complimentary routes.\n", "  (i) For the matrix Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator on the half line, it is shown\nthat if the potential exponentially decreases fast enough then only the\nscattering matrix uniquely determines the self-adjoint potential and the\nboundary condition. (ii) For the matrix Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator on the full\nline, it is shown that if the potential exponentially decreases fast enough\nthen the scattering matrix (or equivalently, the transmission coefficient and\nreflection coefficient) uniquely determine the potential. If the potential\nvanishes on $(-\\infty,0)$ then only the left reflection coefficient uniquely\ndetermine the potential.\n", "  The exoplanet detection rate from gravitational microlensing has grown\nsignificantly in recent years thanks to a great enhancement of resources and\nimproved observational strategy. Current observatories include ground-based\nwide-field and/or robotic world-wide networks of telescopes, as well as\nspace-based observatories such as satellites Spitzer or Kepler/K2. This results\nin a large quantity of data to be processed and analyzed, which is a challenge\nfor modeling codes because of the complexity of the parameter space to be\nexplored, and the intensive computations required to evaluate the models. In\nthis work, I present a method that allows to compute the quadrupole and\nhexadecapole approximation of the finite-source magnification with more\nefficiency that previously available codes, with routines about x6 and x4\nfaster respectively. The quadrupole takes just about twice the time of a\npoint-source evaluation, which advocates for generalizing its use to large\nportion of the light curves. The corresponding routines are available as\nopen-source python codes.\n", "  Recent experimental advances for the fabrication of various borophene sheets\nintroduced new structures with a wide prospect of applications. Borophene is\nthe boron atoms analogue of graphene. Borophene exhibits various structural\npolymorphs all of which are metallic. In this work, we employed\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate the\nmechanical properties of five different single-layer borophene sheets. In\nparticular, we analyzed the effect of loading direction and point vacancy on\nthe mechanical response of borophene. Moreover, we compared the thermal\nstabilities of the considered borophene systems. Based on the results of our\nmodelling, borophene films depending on the atomic configurations and the\nloading direction can yield remarkable elastic modulus in the range of 163-382\nGPa.nm and high ultimate tensile strength from 13.5 GPa.nm to around 22.8\nGPa.nm at the corresponding strain from 0.1 to 0.21. Our study reveals the\nremarkable mechanical characteristics of borophene films.\n", "  Transition metal carbides include a wide variety of materials with attractive\nproperties that are suitable for numerous and diverse applications. Most recent\nexperimental advance could provide a path toward successful synthesis of\nlarge-area and high-quality ultrathin Mo2C membranes with superconducting\nproperties. In the present study, we used first-principles density functional\ntheory calculations to explore the mechanical and optical response of\nsingle-layer and free-standing Mo2C. Uniaxial tensile simulations along the\narmchair and zigzag directions were conducted and we found that while the\nelastic properties are close along various loading directions, nonlinear\nregimes in stress-strain curves are considerably different. We found that Mo2C\nsheets present negative Poisson's ratio and thus can be categorized as an\nauxetic material. Our simulations also reveal that Mo2C films retain their\nmetallic electronic characteristic upon the uniaxial loading. We found that for\nMo2C nanomembranes the dielectric function becomes anisotropic along in-plane\nand out-of plane directions. Our findings can be useful for the practical\napplication of Mo2C sheets in nanodevices.\n", "  Two dimensional allotropes of group IV substrates including silicene,\ngermanene and stanene have recently attracted considerable attention in\nnanodevice fabrication industry. These materials involving the buckled\nstructure have been experimentally fabricated lately. In this study, first\nprinciples density functional theory calculations were utilized to investigate\nthe mechanical properties of single layer and free standing silicene, germanene\nand stanene. Uniaxial tensile and compressive simulations were carried out to\nprobe and compare stress strain properties; such as the Young modulus, Poisson\nratio and ultimate strength. We evaluated the chirality effect on the\nmechanical response and bond structure of the 2D substrates. Our first\nprinciples simulations suggest that in all studied samples application of\nuniaxial loading can alter the electronic nature of the buckled structures into\nthe metallic character. Our investigation provides a general but also useful\nviewpoint with respect to the mechanical properties of silicene, germanene and\nstanene.\n", "  Silicene, germanene and stanene likely to graphene are atomic thick material\nwith interesting properties. We employed first-principles density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations to investigate and compare the interaction of Na or\nLi ions on these films. We first identified the most stable binding sites and\ntheir corresponding binding energies for a single Na or Li adatom on the\nconsidered membranes. Then we gradually increased the ions concentration until\nthe full saturation of the surfaces is achieved. Our Bader charge analysis\nconfirmed complete charge transfer between Li or Na ions with the studied 2D\nsheets. We then utilized nudged elastic band method to analyze and compare the\nenergy barriers for Li or Na ions diffusions along the surface and through the\nfilms thicknesses. Our investigation findings can be useful for the potential\napplication of silicene, germanene and stanene for Na or Li ion batteries.\n", "  Graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets are among 2D attractive materials due to\npresenting unusual physicochemical properties.Nevertheless, no adequate\ninformation exists about their mechanical and thermal properties. Therefore, we\nused classical molecular dynamics simulations to explore the thermal\nconductivity and mechanical response of two main structures of single-layer\ntriazine-basedg-C3N4 films.By performing uniaxial tensile modeling, we found\nremarkable elastic modulus of 320 and 210 GPa, and tensile strength of 47 GPa\nand 30 GPa for two different structures of g-C3N4sheets. Using equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulations, the thermal conductivity of free-standing\ng-C3N4 structures were also predicted to be around 7.6 W/mK and 3.5 W/mK. Our\nstudy suggests the g-C3N4films as exciting candidate for reinforcement of\npolymeric materials mechanical properties.\n", "  We give a brief overview of the current status of Double Field Theory on\nGroup Manifolds (DFTWZW). Therefore, we start by reviewing some basic notions\nknown from Double Field Theory (DFT) and show how they extend/generalize into\nthe framework of Double Field Theory on Group Manifolds. In this context, we\ndiscuss the relationship between both theories and the transition from DFTWZW\nto DFT. Furthermore, we address some open questions and present an outlook into\nour current research.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) represent a large family of\nhigh-quality 2D materials with attractive electronic, thermal, chemical, and\nmechanical properties. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) technique is currently\nthe most reliable route to synthesis few-atomic layer thick and large-scale\nTMDs films. However, the effects of grain boundaries formed during the CVD\nmethod on the properties of TMDs nanomembranes have remained less explored. In\nthis study, we therefore aim to investigate the thermal conduction along\npolycrystalline molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the representative member of\nTMDs nanomembranes family. This goal was achieved by developing a combined\natomistic-continuum multiscale method. In the proposed approach, reactive\nmolecular dynamics simulations were carried out to assess thermal contact\nconductance of diverse grain boundaries with various defects configurations.\nThe effective thermal conductivity along the CVD grown polycrystalline and\nsingle-layer MoS2 was finally acquired by conducting finite element modelling.\nInsight provided by this investigation can be useful to evaluate the effective\nthermal transport along a wide variety of 2D materials and structures.\n", "  Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a highly attractive 2D material due to its\ninteresting electronic properties. Recent experimental advances confirm the\npossibility of further tuning the electronic properties of MoS2 through the\nfabrication of single-layer heterostructures consisting of semiconducting (2H)\nand metallic (1T) MoS2 phases. Nonetheless, despite significant technological\nand scientific interest, there is currently limited information concerning the\nmechanical properties of these heterostructure systems. This investigation aims\nto extend our understanding of the mechanical properties of all-MoS2\nsingle-layer structures at room temperature. This goal was achieved by\nperforming extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations using a recently\ndeveloped RexFF forcefield. We first studied the direction dependent mechanical\nproperties of defect-free 2H and 1T phases. Our modelling results for pristine\n2H MoS2 were found to be in good agreement with the experimental tests and\nfirst-principles theoretical predictions. We also discuss the mechanical\nresponse of 2H/1T single layer heterostructures. Our reactive molecular\ndynamics results suggest all-MoS2 heterostructures as suitable candidates to\nprovide a strong and flexible material with tuneable electronic properties.\n", "  Borophene, the boron atom analogue to graphene, being atomic thick have been\njust recently experimentally fabricated. In this work, we employ\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations to investigate the\ninteraction of Ca, Mg, Na or Li atoms with single-layer and free-standing\nborophene. We first identified the most stable binding sites and their\ncorresponding binding energies as well and then we gradually increased the ions\nconcentration. Our calculations predict strong binding energies of around 4.03\neV, 2.09 eV, 2.92 eV and 3.28 eV between the borophene substrate and Ca, Mg, Na\nor Li ions, respectively. We found that the binding energy generally decreases\nby increasing the ions content. Using the Bader charge analysis, we evaluate\nthe charge transfer between the adatoms and the borophene sheet. Our\ninvestigation proposes the borophene as a 2D material with a remarkably high\ncapacity of around 800 mAh/g, 1960 mAh/g, 1380 mAh/g and 1720 mAh/g for Ca, Mg,\nNa or Li ions storage, respectively. This study can be useful for the possible\napplication of borophene for the rechargeable ion batteries.\n", "  The Kepler light curve of DF Cyg is unparalleled in precision and cadence for\nany RV Tau star to date spanning a baseline of $\\sim$4 years and clearly\ndisplaying the signature pulsating behavior of alternating deep and shallow\nminima as well as the long-term trend indicative of an RVb-type variable. We\nmeasured DF Cyg's formal period (the time interval between two successive deep\nminima) to be $~49.84 \\pm 0.02~$days. The trend in the arrival times emulates\nthat of the long-term period. There appears to be precisely 16 deep+shallow\nminima cycles in one long-term cycle, suggesting a long-term cycle period of\n$\\approx$ $795 \\pm 5~$days. We argue that binarity may naturally explain the\nlong-term periodicity in DF Cyg. The spectral energy distribution of DF Cyg\nfeatures an infrared excess indicative of a disk possibly linked to a binary\ncompanion. From a recent Gaia parallax measurement for DF Cyg, we calculated\nthat it has a distance of $990 \\pm 372$pc and a physical radius of $R_\\star =\n10.3 \\pm 3.8$ R$_\\odot$. From kinematics and geometric arguments, we argue that\nthe most likely interpretation for the decrease in flux from the long-period\nmaximum to the long-period minimum, as well as the reduction of short-term\npulsation amplitude, is caused by an occulting body such as a disk surrounding\nDF Cyg and its binary companion.\n", "  Semiconductor nanoparticles of cadmium chalcogenides are known to exhibit\npronounced thickness-dependent $E_0$ series of exciton transitions at the\n$\\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone (BZ). In this work, we report an\nexperimental evidence for high-energy series of exciton transitions, which\noriginates from BZ points different from the $\\Gamma$ point, in the family of\ncadmium chalcogenide quasi-2D nanoplatelets (NPLs). Intensive UV absorption\nbands demonstrating a pronounced size effect are observed for CdTe, CdSe, and\nCdS NPLs in addition to the $E_0$ exciton bands in the visible region. These\nnew bands are attributed to transitions analogous to the $E_1$, $E_1+\\Delta_1$,\nand $E_2$ series observed in bulk crystals. First-principles DFT calculations\nof the electronic structure and absorption spectra support this explanation and\nshow that the main contribution to these optical transitions comes from $X$ and\n$M$ points of the 2D BZ, which originate from $L$ and $X$ points of the 3D BZ.\nAt the same time, the $E_0$ series of transitions at the $\\Gamma$ point is well\ndescribed by the multiband effective-mass model. The observation of the UV\nexciton bands reveals tunable optical properties of cadmium chalcogenide NPLs\nin UV spectral region, which may be interesting for practical applications.\n", "  The most recent experimental advances could provide ways for the fabrication\nof several atomic thick and planar forms of boron atoms. For the first time, we\nexplore the mechanical properties of five types of boron films with various\nvacancy ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.15, using molecular dynamics simulations\nwith ReaxFF force field. It is found that the Young's modulus and tensile\nstrength decrease with increasing the temperature. We found that boron sheets\nexhibit an anisotropic mechanical response due to the different arrangement of\natoms along the armchair and zigzag directions. At room temperature, 2D Young's\nmodulus and fracture stress of these five sheets appear in the range 63 N/m and\n12 N/m, respectively. In addition, the strains at tensile strength are in the\nranges of 9, 11, and 10 percent at 1, 300, and 600 K, respectively. This\ninvestigation not only reveals the remarkable stiffness of 2D boron, but\nestablishes relations between the mechanical properties of the boron sheets to\nthe loading direction, temperature and atomic structures.\n", "  A fraction of early-type dwarf galaxies in the Virgo cluster have a disk\ncomponent and even possess disk features such as bar, lens, and spiral arms. In\nthis study, we construct 15 galaxy models that resemble VCC856, considered to\nbe an infalling progenitor of disk dwarf galaxies, within observational error\nranges, and use $N$-body simulations to study their long-term dynamical\nevolution in isolation as well as the formation of bar in them. We find that\ndwarf disk galaxies readily form bars unless they have an excessively\nconcentrated halo or a hot disk. This suggests that infalling dwarf disk\ngalaxies are intrinsically unstable to bar formation, even without any external\nperturbation, accounting for a population of barred dwarf galaxies in the\noutskirts of the Virgo cluster. The bars form earlier and stronger in galaxies\nwith a lower fraction of counter-streaming motions, lower halo concentration,\nlower velocity anisotropy, and thinner disk. Similarly to normal disk galaxies,\ndwarf disk galaxies also undergo recurrent buckling instabilities. The first\nbuckling instability tends to shorten the bar and to thicken the disk, and\ndrives a dynamical transition in the bar pattern speed as well as mass inflow\nrate. In nine models, the bars regrow after the mild first buckling instability\ndue to the efficient transfer of disk angular momentum to the halo, and are\nsubject to recurrent buckling instabilities to turn into X-shaped bulges.\n", "  Band alignment between solids is a crucial issue in condensed matter physics\nand electronic devices. Although the XPS method has been used as a routine\nmethod for determination of the band alignment, the theoretical calculations by\ncopying the XPS band alignment procedure usually fail to match the measured\nresults. In this work, a reliable ab-initio calculation method for band\nalignment is proposed on the basis of the XPS procedure and in consideration of\nsurface polarity and lattice deformation. Application of our method to anatase\nand rutile TiO2 shows well agreement between calculation and experiment.\nFurthermore, our method can produce two types of band alignment: the coupled\nand the intrinsic, depending on whether the solid/solid interface effect is\ninvolved or not. The coupled and intrinsic band alignments correspond to\nalignments measured by XPS and electrochemical impedance analysis,\nrespectively, explaining why band alignments reported by these two experiments\nare rather inconsistent.\n", "  At interfaces between oxide materials, lattice and electronic reconstructions\nalways play important roles in exotic phenomena. In this study, the density\nfunctional theory and maximally localized Wannier functions are employed to\ninvestigate the (LaTiO$_3$)$_n$/(LaVO$_3$)$_n$ magnetic superlattices. The\nelectron transfer from Ti$^{3+}$ to V$^{3+}$ is predicted, which violates the\nintuitive band alignment based on the electronic structures of LaTiO$_3$ and\nLaVO$_3$. Such unconventional charge transfer quenches the magnetism of\nLaTiO$_3$ layer mostly and leads to metal-insulator transition in the $n=1$\nsuperlattice when the stacking orientation is altered. In addition, the\ncompatibility among the polar structure, ferrimagnetism, and metallicity is\npredicted in the $n=2$ superlattice.\n", "  Frolop and Scott (2016) claim significant 1-1 correspondence between\nanomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the digits of pi, which\nthey call 'Pi in the Sky'. They have without attribution republished the famous\nwork of Joe Hill (Hill 1911), who first proposed this idea, then repudiated it.\n", "  The Spin Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment investigated the spin\nstructure of the proton via inclusive electron scattering at the Continuous\nElectron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, VA.\nA double--polarization measurement of polarized asymmetries was performed using\nthe University of Virginia solid polarized ammonia target with target\npolarization aligned longitudinal and near transverse to the electron beam,\nallowing the extraction of the spin asymmetries $A_1$ and $A_2$, and spin\nstructure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Polarized electrons of energies of 4.7 and\n5.9 GeV were scattered to be viewed by a novel, non-magnetic array of detectors\nobserving a four-momentum transfer range of 2 to 6 GeV$^2$. This document\naddresses the extraction of the spin asymmetries and spin structure functions,\nwith a focus on spin structure function $g_2$, which we have measured as a\nfunction of $x$ and $W$ in four $Q^2$ bins.\n", "  In this manuscript we propose, analyse, and discuss a possible new principle\nbehind traditional cuisine: the Food-bridging hypothesis and its comparison\nwith the food-pairing hypothesis using the same dataset and graphical models\nemployed in the food-pairing study by Ahn et al. [Scientific Reports, 1:196\n(2011)].\n  The Food-bridging hypothesis assumes that if two ingredients do not share a\nstrong molecular or empirical affinity, they may become affine through a chain\nof pairwise affinities. That is, in a graphical model as employed by Ahn et\nal., a chain represents a path that joints the two ingredients, the shortest\npath represents the strongest pairwise chain of affinities between the two\ningredients.\n  Food-pairing and Food-bridging are different hypotheses that may describe\npossible mechanisms behind the recipes of traditional cuisines. Food-pairing\nintensifies flavour by mixing ingredients in a recipe with similar chemical\ncompounds, and food-bridging smoothes contrast between ingredients. Both\nfood-pairing and food-bridging are observed in traditional cuisines, as shown\nin this work.\n  We observed four classes of cuisines according to food-pairing and\nfood-bridging: (1) East Asian cuisines, at one extreme, tend to avoid\nfood-pairing as well as food-bridging; and (4) Latin American cuisines, at the\nother extreme, follow both principles. For the two middle classes: (2)\nSoutheastern Asian cuisines, avoid food-pairing and follow food-bridging; and\n(3) Western cuisines, follow food-pairing and avoid food-bridging.\n", "  For interacting 2D electrons in the presence of magnetic field at half\nfilling, the system forms a `composite Fermi liquid(CFL)' with emergent Fermi\nsurface and exhibits metallic behavior, based on the standard Halperin, Lee,\nand Read(HLR) field theory. Recently, Son introduces a composite Dirac theory\nas the low energy effective description of Half-filled Landau Level. Such\ntheory exhibits particle-hole symmetry and the underlying composite Fermi\nsurface displays a robust $\\pi$ Berry phase. In this paper, we start from the\nbilayer Half-filled Landau Level system where the two composite Fermi surface\nacquires interlayer coherence and forms bonding/anti-bonding composite fermi\nsea. The corresponding interlayer coherent composite Fermi liquid(ICCFL) phase\nprovides a straightforward landscape to verify the Dirac nature in Son's theory\nand extract the hidden Berry phase structure of the composite Fermi surface.\nThe ICCFL phase contains two Fermi surfaces which are detached in most regions\nbut adhesive at two hot spots. Such nematic structure is a consequence of the\nBerry phase encoded in the Dirac Fermi surface which is absent in HLR theory.\nDue to the nematicity in ICCFL, the system supports half-quantum vortex with\ndeconfined $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ gauge flux and the phase transition toward ICCFL\ncontains a Lifshitz criticality with $z=3$ dynamical exponent. In addition, the\nexciton order parameter carries topological spin number so the ICCFL contains a\nunique Wen-Zee term which connects EM response with the background geometry\ncurvature.\n", "  First-principles calculations are performed to investigate the effects of the\nadsorption of gas molecules (CO, NO, NO2, H2S, N2, H2O, O2, NH3 and H2) on the\nelectronic properties of atomically thin indium selenium (InSe). Our study\nshows that the lone-pair states of Se are located at the top of the valence\nband of InSe and close to the Fermi energy level, implying its high sensitivity\nto external adsorbates. Among these gas molecules, H2 and H2S are strong\ndonors, NO, NO2, H2O and NH3 are effective acceptors, while CO and N2 exhibit\nnegligible charge transfer. The O2 molecule has very limited oxidizing ability\nand a relatively weak interaction with InSe which is comparable to the N2\nadsorption. A clear band gap narrowing is found for the H2S, NO2, and NH3\nadsorbed systems whereas a Fermi level shifting to the conduction band is\nobserved upon a moderate uptake of H2 molecules. Our analysis suggests several\ninteresting applications of InSe: 1) Due to the different interaction behaviors\nwith these external molecules, InSe can be used for gas sensing applications;\n2) By monitoring the adsorption/desorption behavior of these gas molecules, the\npopulation of hole states in InSe due to photon stimulation or defect\nproduction can be quantitatively estimated; and 3) It is promising for novel\nelectronic and optoelectronic applications since the adsorption-induced in-gap\nstates and strong charge transfer are able to change the content and polarity\nof charged carriers and lead to different optical properties.\n", "  Any numerical method fails to provide us with acceptable results if not\nequipped with appropriate boundary conditions. Catering to more realistic\napplications, in the present article we have extended the work done on the one\nplus one dimensional Boltzmann equation to the Boltzmann equation involving\nmulti-dimensions in physical and velocity space. Criteria for stable boundary\nconditions, using energy estimates, have been discussed for linear symmetric\nhyperbolic initial boundary value problems. Since the use of energy estimates\nrequires the hyperbolic system to be symmetric, the symmetric hyperbolicity of\nthe moment equations arising from a Hermite discretization of the Boltzmann\nequation has been studied. Furthermore, an algorithm to construct a general\nsymmetrizer for an arbitrary order Hermite discretization has been presented. A\nblock structure for the multi-dimensional moment equations has been recognised\nwhich has been used to construct stable Onsager boundary conditions. The newly\nproposed Onsager boundary conditions have been used to study a Poisson heat\nconduction problem using a higher order Hermite discretization; the results\nhave been compared to those obtained from the Maxwell's accommodation model.\n", "  We use numerical modeling to investigate the combined effects of impact\nvelocity and acoustic fluidization on lunar craters in the simple-to-complex\ntransition regime. To investigate the full scope of the problem, we employed\nthe two widely adopted Block-Model of acoustic fluidization scaling assumptions\n(scaling block size by impactor size and scaling by coupling parameter) and\ncompared their outcomes. Impactor size and velocity were varied, such that\nlarge/slow and small/fast impactors would produce craters of the same diameter\nwithin a suite of simulations, ranging in diameter from 10-26 km, which\nstraddles the simple-to-complex crater transition on Moon. Our study suggests\nthat the transition from simple to complex structures is highly sensitive to\nthe choice of the time decay and viscosity constants in the Block-Model of\nacoustic fluidization. Moreover, the combination of impactor size and velocity\nplays a greater role than previously thought in the morphology of craters in\nthe simple-to-complex size range. We propose that scaling of block size by\nimpactor size is an appropriate choice for modeling simple-to-complex craters\non planetary surfaces, including both varying and constant impact velocities,\nas the modeling results are more consistent with the observed morphology of\nlunar craters. This scaling suggests that the simple-to-complex transition\noccurs at a larger crater size, if higher impact velocities are considered, and\nis consistent with the observation that the simple-to-complex transition occurs\nat larger sizes on Mercury than Mars.\n", "  This paper reports on the conclusions of a 2013 Joint DOE/NCI Workshop, and\ntranslates clinical accelerator facility requirements into accelerator and\nbeam-delivery technical specifications. Available or feasible accelerator\ntechnologies are compared, including a new concept for a compact, CW, and\nvariable energy light ion accelerator currently under development. This new\nlight ion accelerator is based on advances in non-scaling Fixed-Field\nAlternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator design. The new design concepts combine\nisochronous orbits with long (up to 4m) straight sections in a compact\nracetrack format allowing inner circulating orbits to be energy selected for\nlow-loss, CW extraction, effectively eliminating the high-loss energy degrader\nin conventional CW cyclotron designs.\n", "  High-transmissivity all-dielectric metasurfaces have recently attracted\nattention towards the realization of ultra-compact optical devices and systems.\nSilicon based metasurfaces, in particular, are highly promising considering the\npossibility of monolithic integration with VLSI circuits. Realization of\nsilicon based metasurfaces operational in the visible wavelengths remains a\nchallenge. A numerical study of silicon metasurfaces based on stepped truncated\ncone shaped nanoantenna elements is presented. Metasurfaces based on the\nstepped conical geometry can be designed for operation in the 700nm to 800nm\nwavelength window and achieve full cycle phase response (0 to pi with an\nimproved transmittance in comparison with previously reported cylindrical\ngeometry [1]. A systematic parameter study of the influence of various\ngeometrical parameters on the achievable amplitude and phase coverage is\nreported.\n", "  An effective harmonic potential for photons is achieved in a photonic crystal\nstructure, owing to the balance of the background dispersion and a bichromatic\npotential. Consequently, ultra-compact resonators with several equi-spaced\nresonances and high loaded Q factors (0.7 million) are demonstrated. A detailed\nstatistical analysis is carried out by exploiting the complex reflection\nspectra measured with Optical Coherent Tomography. The log-normal distribution\nof the intrinsic Q-factors peaks at 3 million. The device is made of\n$Ga_{0.5}In_{0.5}P$ in order to suppress the two photon absorption in the\nTelecom spectral range considered here. This is crucial to turn the strong\nlocalization of light into ultra-efficient parametric interactions.\n", "  In synchrotron machines, the beam extraction is accomplished by a combination\nof septa and kicker magnets which deflect the beam from an accelerator into\nanother. Ideally the kicker field must rise/fall in between the beam bunches.\nHowever, in reality, an intentional beam-free time region (aka \"notch\") is\ncreated on the beam pulse to assure that the beam can be extracted with minimal\nlosses. In the case of the Fermilab Booster, the notch is created in the ring\nnear injection energy by the use of fast kickers which deposit the beam in a\nshielded collimation region within the accelerator tunnel. With increasing beam\npower it is desirable to create this notch at the lowest possible energy to\nminimize activation. The Fermilab Proton Improvement Plan (PIP) initiated an\nR&D project to build a laser system to create the notch within a linac beam\npulse at 750 keV. This talk will describe the concept for the laser notcher and\ndiscuss our current status, commissioning results, and future plans.\n", "  We deposit intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films by\nreactive pulsed laser deposition, for various hydrogen pressures in the 0-20 Pa\nrange, at a low deposition temperature of 120C, and investigate the hydrogen\nincorporation, structural, optical, and electrical properties of the films, as\na function of the ambient hydrogen pressure. The film thickness decreases\nlinearly as the hydrogen pressure increases. The hydrogen content of the films\nis determined by infrared spectroscopy and the optical bandgap from UV-Vis-NIR\ntransmittance and reflectance measurements. Electric measurements yield the\ndark conductivity of the films. The hydrogen concentration of the films lies in\nthe 10^21-10^22 cm^(-3) range and increases with the hydrogen pressure until\nthe latter reaches 15 Pa, beyond which the hydrogen concentration decreases.\nThe optical bandgap and dark conductivity follow the hydrogen concentration\nvariation of the films. The dark conductivity lies in the 10^(-9)-10^(-10) S/cm\nrange. An unusually wide optical bandgap of 2.2-2.6 eV is observed.\n", "  We fabricate and compare nanocomposite thin-film ZnO chemoresistive acetone\nsensors with gold or palladium nanoparticles on the surface, at low operating\ntemperatures. The sensors are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and operate\nin the temperature range 159-200oC. The ZnO films are polycrystalline,\ncrystallizing mainly at the (002) and (101) orientations of the hexagonal\nphase. The nanocomposite ZnO:Au and ZnO:Pd sensors have a lower detection limit\nand show a response enhancement factor between 2-7, compared with pure ZnO\nsensors. The ZnO:Pd sensor performs better than the ZnO:Au sensor. The ZnO:Pd\nsensor sensitivity increases with the amount of palladium on the surface, while\nit remains roughly unchanged with the ZnO thickness. The lowest acetone\nconcentration we detect is 26 ppm for the operating temperature of 200oC.\n", "  During summer, melt ponds have a significant influence on Arctic sea-ice\nalbedo. The melt pond fraction (MPF) also has the ability to forecast the\nArctic sea-ice in a certain period. It is important to retrieve accurate melt\npond fraction (MPF) from satellite data for Arctic research. This paper\nproposes a satellite MPF retrieval model based on the multi-layer neural\nnetwork, named MPF-NN. Our model uses multi-spectral satellite data as model\ninput and MPF information from multi-site and multi-period visible imagery as\nprior knowledge for modeling. It can effectively model melt ponds evolution of\ndifferent regions and periods over the Arctic. Evaluation results show that the\nMPF retrieved from MODIS data using the proposed model has an RMSE of 3.91% and\na correlation coefficient of 0.73. The seasonal distribution of MPF is also\nconsistent with previous results.\n", "  The newly detected TRAPPIST-1 system, with seven low-mass, roughly\nEarth-sized planets transiting a nearby ultra-cool dwarf, is one of the most\nimportant exoplanet discoveries to date. The short baseline of the available\ndiscovery observations, however, means that the planetary masses (obtained\nthrough measurement of transit timing variations of the planets of the system)\nare not yet well constrained. The masses reported in the discovery paper were\nderived using a combination of photometric timing measurements obtained from\nthe ground and from the Spitzer spacecraft, and have uncertainties ranging from\n30\\% to nearly 100\\%, with the mass of the outermost, $P=18.8\\,{\\rm d}$, planet\nh remaining unmeasured. Here, we present an analysis that supplements the\ntiming measurements of the discovery paper with 73.6 days of photometry\nobtained by the K2 Mission. Our analysis refines the orbital parameters for all\nof the planets in the system. We substantially improve the upper bounds on\neccentricity for inner six planets (finding $e<0.02$ for inner six known\nmembers of the system), and we derive masses of $0.79\\pm 0.27 \\,M_{\\oplus}$,\n$1.63\\pm 0.63\\,M_{\\oplus}$, $0.33\\pm 0.15\\,M_{\\oplus}$,\n$0.24^{+0.56}_{-0.24}\\,M_{\\oplus}$, $0.36\\pm 0.12\\,M_{\\oplus}$, $0.566\\pm\n0.038\\,M_{\\oplus}$, and $0.086\\pm 0.084\\,M_{\\oplus}$ for planets b, c, d, e, f,\ng, and h, respectively.\n", "  We employ quantum relative entropy to establish the relation between the\nmeasurement uncertainty and its disturbance on a state in the presence (and\nabsence) of quantum memory. For two incompatible observables, we present the\nmeasurement-disturbance relation and the disturbance trade-off relation. We\nfind that without quantum memory the disturbance induced by the measurement is\nnever less than the measurement uncertainty and with quantum memory they depend\non the conditional entropy of the measured state. We also generalize these\nrelations to the case with multiple measurements. These relations are\ndemonstrated by two examples.\n", "  The records statistics in stationary and non-stationary fractal time series\nis studied extensively. By calculating various concepts in record dynamics, we\nfind some interesting results. In stationary fractional Gaussian noises, we\nobserve a universal behavior for the whole range of Hurst exponents. However,\nfor non-stationary fractional Brownian motions the record dynamics is crucially\ndependent on the memory, which plays the role of a non-stationarity index,\nhere. Indeed, the deviation from the results of the stationary case increases\nby increasing the Hurst exponent in fractional Brownian motions. We demonstrate\nthat the memory governs the dynamics of the records as long as it causes\nnon-stationarity in fractal stochastic processes, otherwise, it has no impact\non the records statistics.\n", "  Reinforcement learning involves decision making in dynamic and uncertain\nenvironments, and constitutes one important element of artificial intelligence\n(AI). In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that the ultrafast chaotic\noscillatory dynamics of lasers efficiently solve the multi-armed bandit problem\n(MAB), which requires decision making concerning a class of difficult\ntrade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To solve the MAB, a\ncertain degree of randomness is required for exploration purposes. However,\npseudo-random numbers generated using conventional electronic circuitry\nencounter severe limitations in terms of their data rate and the quality of\nrandomness due to their algorithmic foundations. We generate laser chaos\nsignals using a semiconductor laser sampled at a maximum rate of 100 GSample/s,\nand combine it with a simple decision-making principle called tug-of-war with a\nvariable threshold, to ensure ultrafast, adaptive and accurate decision making\nat a maximum adaptation speed of 1 GHz. We found that decision-making\nperformance was maximized with an optimal sampling interval, and we highlight\nthe exact coincidence between the negative autocorrelation inherent in laser\nchaos and decision-making performance. This study paves the way for a new realm\nof ultrafast photonics in the age of AI, where the ultrahigh bandwidth of\nphotons can provide new value.\n", "  We present parallel version of Rosenbluth Self-Avoiding Walk generation\nmethod implemented on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) using CUDA libraries.\nThe method scales almost linearly with the number of CUDA cores and the method\nefficiency has only hardware limitations. The method is introduced in two\nrealizations: on a cubic lattice and in real space. We find a good agreement\nbetween serial and parallel implementations and consistent results between\nlattice and real space realizations of the method for linear chain statistics.\nThe developed GPU implementations of Rosenbluth algorithm can be used in Monte\nCarlo simulations and other computational methods that require large sampling\nof molecules conformations.\n", "  Plenoptic imaging is a promising optical modality that simultaneously\ncaptures the location and the propagation direction of light in order to enable\ntridimensional imaging in a single shot. We demonstrate that it is possible to\nimplement plenoptic imaging through second-order correlations of chaotic light,\nthus enabling to overcome the typical limitations of classical plenoptic\ndevices.\n", "  High-precision measurements of radial velocities of the M 67 cluster members\nare used to calculate the radial-velocity dispersions in the stellar groups\nfound earlier in the cluster's corona. The previously detected feature in one\nof the groups (Group 60) consisting of stars with almost identical space\nvelocities was confirmed. The possibility of more accurate future studies of\nthe parameters of star groups using the Gaia catalogues is discussed.\n", "  Imitation is widely observed in populations of decision-making agents. Using\nour recent convergence results for asynchronous imitation dynamics on networks,\nwe consider how such networks can be efficiently driven to a desired\nequilibrium state by offering payoff incentives for using a certain strategy,\neither uniformly or targeted to individuals. In particular, if for each\navailable strategy, agents playing that strategy receive maximum payoff when\ntheir neighbors play that same strategy, we show that providing incentives to\nagents in a network that is at equilibrium will result in convergence to a\nunique new equilibrium. For the case when a uniform incentive can be offered to\nall agents, this result allows the computation of the optimal incentive using a\nbinary search algorithm. When incentives can be targeted to individual agents,\nwe propose an algorithm to select which agents should be chosen based on\niteratively maximizing a ratio of the number of agents who adopt the desired\nstrategy to the payoff incentive required to get those agents to do so.\nSimulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm computes near-optimal\ntargeted payoff incentives for a range of networks and payoff distributions in\ncoordination games.\n", "  We describe an experiment, located in south-east Colorado, USA, that measured\naerosol optical depth profiles using two Lidar techniques. Two independent\ndetectors measured scattered light from a vertical UV laser beam. One detector,\nlocated at the laser site, measured light via the inelastic Raman\nbackscattering process. This is a common method used in atmospheric science for\nmeasuring aerosol optical depth profiles. The other detector, located\napproximately 40km distant, viewed the laser beam from the side. This detector\nfeatured a 3.5m2 mirror and measured elastically scattered light in a bistatic\nLidar configuration following the method used at the Pierre Auger cosmic ray\nobservatory. The goal of this experiment was to assess and improve methods to\nmeasure atmospheric clarity, specifically aerosol optical depth profiles, for\ncosmic ray UV fluorescence detectors that use the atmosphere as a giant\ncalorimeter. The experiment collected data from September 2010 to July 2011\nunder varying conditions of aerosol loading. We describe the instruments and\ntechniques and compare the aerosol optical depth profiles measured by the Raman\nand bistatic Lidar detectors.\n", "  It is shown that the fast scrambling of information in a black hole can be\nviewed as Brownian motion of information in a fluid with negative viscosity\n(and negative temperature). It is argued that a non-local character of the fast\nscrambling is only an illusion; the stretched horizon with negative viscosity\nis an amplifying medium that mimics non-locality and superluminal\ncommunication.\n", "  Here we report a method for visualization of volumetric structural\ninformation of live biological samples with no exogenous contrast agents. The\nprocess is made possible through a technique that involves generation,\nsynthesis and analysis of three-dimensional (3D) Fourier components of light\ndiffracted by the sample. This leads to the direct recovery of quantitative\ncellular morphology with no iterative procedures for reduced computational\ncomplexity. Combing with the fact that the technique is easily adaptive to any\nimaging platform and requires minimum sample preparation, our proposed method\nis particularly promising for observing fast, volumetric and dynamic events\npreviously only accessible through staining methods.\n", "  In this work we introduce Qumin, a novel quantum programming language with a\nfocus on providing an easy to use, minimalist, high-level, and easily\nextensible platform for quantum programming. Qumin's design concentrates on\nencompassing the various interactions between classical and quantum computation\nvia the use of two sublanguages: an untyped one that handles classical\npreparation and control, and one linearly typed that explicitly handles quantum\nroutines. This allows the classical part of the language to be freely used for\ngeneral programming while placing restrictions on the quantum part that enforce\nrules of quantum computing like the no-cloning of qubits.\n  We describe both the language's theoretical foundations in terms of lambda\ncalculi and linear type systems, and more practical matters such as\nimplementations of algorithms and useful programming tools like matrix and\noracle generators that streamline the interaction of the classical and quantum\nfragments of a program. Finally, we provide an experimental open-source\nimplementation of an interpreter, typechecker and related tools for the\nlanguage (which can be found in \\url{https://github.com/wintershammer/QImp}).\n", "  Typical front-ends of modern light-ion high-intensity accelerators typically\nconsist of an ion source, a Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT), a Radiofrequency\nQuadrupole (RFQ) and a Medium Energy Beam Transport (MEBT), which is followed\nby the main linac accelerating structures. Over the years, many LEBTs have been\ndesigned, constructed and operated very successfully. In this paper, we present\nthe guiding principles and compromises that lead to the design choices of the\nPXIE LEBT, including the rationale for a beam line that allows un-neutralized\ntransport over a significant portion of the LEBT whether the beam is pulsed or\nDC.\n", "  The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) will utilize a beamline located at\nFermilab to provide and aim a neutrino beam of sufficient intensity and\nappropriate energy range toward the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)\ndetectors, placed deep underground at the SURF Facility in Lead, South Dakota.\nThe primary proton beam (60-120 GeV) will be extracted from the MI-10 section\nof Fermilab's Main Injector. Neutrinos will be produced when the protons\ninteract with a solid target to produce mesons which will be subsequently\nfocused by magnetic horns into a 194m long decay pipe where they decay into\nmuons and neutrinos. The parameters of the facility were determined taking into\naccount the physics goals, spatial and radiological constraints, and the\nexperience gained by operating the NuMI facility at Fermilab. The Beamline\nfacility is designed for initial operation at a proton-beam power of 1.2 MW,\nwith the capability to support an upgrade to 2.4 MW. LBNF/DUNE obtained CD-1\napproval in November 2015. We discuss here the design status and the associated\nchallenges as well as the R&D and plans for improvements before baselining the\nfacility.\n", "  Recently, single crystalline carbon nitride 2D material with a C3N\nstoichiometry has been synthesized. In this investigation, we explored the\nmechanical response and thermal transport along pristine, free-standing and\nsingle-layer C3N. To this aim, we conducted extensive first-principles density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations as well as molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. DFT results reveal that C3N nanofilms can yield remarkably high\nelastic modulus of 341 GPa.nm and tensile strength of 35 GPa.nm, very close to\nthose of defect-free graphene. Classical MD simulations performed at a low\ntemperature, predict accurately the elastic modulus of 2D C3N with less than 3%\ndifference with the first-principles estimation. The deformation process of C3N\nnanosheets was studied both by the DFT and MD simulations. Ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations show that single-layer C3N can withstand high temperatures\nlike 4000 K. Notably, the phononic thermal conductivity of free-standing C3N\nwas predicted to be as high as 815 W/mK. Our atomistic modelling results reveal\nultra high stiffness and thermal conductivity of C3N nanomembranes and\ntherefore propose them as promising candidates for new application such as the\nthermal management in nanoelectronics or simultaneously reinforcing the thermal\nand mechanical properties of polymeric materials.\n", "  The widely held belief that BQP strictly contains BPP raises fundamental\nquestions: if we cannot efficiently compute predictions for the behavior of\nquantum systems, how can we test their behavior? In other words, is quantum\nmechanics falsifiable? In cryptographic settings, how can a customer of a\nfuture untrusted quantum computing company be convinced of the correctness of\nits quantum computations? To provide answers to these questions, we define\nQuantum Prover Interactive Proofs (QPIP). Whereas in standard interactive\nproofs the prover is computationally unbounded, here our prover is in BQP,\nrepresenting a quantum computer. The verifier models our current computational\ncapabilities: it is a BPP machine, with access to only a few qubits. Our main\ntheorem states, roughly: 'Any language in BQP has a QPIP, which also hides the\ncomputation from the prover'. We provide two proofs, one based on a quantum\nauthentication scheme (QAS) relying on random Clifford rotations and the other\nbased on a QAS which uses polynomial codes (BOCG+ 06), combined with secure\nmultiparty computation methods.\n  This is the journal version of work reported in 2008 (ABOE08) and presented\nin ICS 2010; here we have completed the details and made the proofs rigorous.\nSome of the proofs required major modifications and corrections. Notably, the\nclaim that the polynomial QPIP is fault tolerant was removed. Similar results\n(with different protocols) were reported independently around the same time of\nthe original version in BFK08. The initial independent works (ABOE08, BFK08)\nignited a long line of research of blind verifiable quantum computation, which\nwe survey here, along with connections to various cryptographic problems.\nImportantly, the problems of making the results fault tolerant as well as\nremoving the need for quantum communication altogether remain open.\n", "  This work discusses the numerical approximation of a nonlinear\nreaction-advection-diffusion equation, which is a dimensionless form of the\nWeertman equation. This equation models steadily-moving dislocations in\nmaterials science. It reduces to the celebrated Peierls-Nabarro equation when\nits advection term is set to zero. The approach rests on considering a\ntime-dependent formulation, which admits the equation under study as its\nlong-time limit. Introducing a Preconditioned Collocation Scheme based on\nFourier transforms, the iterative numerical method presented solves the\ntime-dependent problem, delivering at convergence the desired numerical\nsolution to the Weertman equation. Although it rests on an explicit\ntime-evolution scheme, the method allows for large time steps, and captures the\nsolution in a robust manner. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the\napproach for several types of nonlinearities.\n", "  In this paper, we study the spectrum of the one-dimensional vibrating free\nrod equation $u^{(4)}-\\tau u\"=\\mu u$ under tension $(\\tau>0)$ or compression\n$(\\tau<0)$. The eigenvalues $\\mu$ as functions of the tension/compression\nparameter $\\tau$ exhibit three distinct types of behavior. In particular,\neigenvalue branches in the lower half-plane exhibit a cascading pattern of\nbarely-avoided crossings.\n  We provide a complete description of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues by\nimplicitly parameterizing the eigenvalue curves. We also establish properties\nof the eigenvalue curves such as monotonicity, crossings, asymptotic growth,\ncascading and phantom spectral lines.\n", "  CW generation of anti-Stokes Raman laser on a number of blue-green argon-ion\nlines (4p-4s, 4p-3d) has been demonstrated with optical pumping from metastable\nlevels 3d'^2G, 3d^4F. It is found, that the population transfer rate is\nincreased by a factor of 3-5 (and hence, the output power of such Raman laser)\nowing to Coulomb diffusion in the velocity space. Measured are the excitation\nand relaxation rates for the metastable level. The Bennett hole on the\nmetastable level has been recorded using the probe field technique. It has been\nshown that the Coulomb diffusion changes shape of the contour to exponential\ncusp profile while its width becomes 100 times the Lorentzian one and reaches\nvalues close to the Doppler width. Such a giant broadening is also confirmed by\nthe shape of the absorption saturation curve.\n", "  Multiparametric quantum $gl(2)$ algebras are presented according to a\nclassification based on their corresponding Lie bialgebra structures. From\nthem, the non-relativistic limit leading to quantum harmonic oscillator\nalgebras is implemented in the form of generalized Lie bialgebra contractions.\n", "  An analytic solution for Bragg grating with linear chirp in the form of\nconfluent hypergeometric functions is analyzed in the asymptotic limit of long\ngrating. Simple formulas for reflection coefficient and group delay are\nderived. The simplification makes it possible to analyze irregularities of the\ncurves and suggest the ways of their suppression. It is shown that the increase\nin chirp at fixed other parameters decreases the oscillations in the group\ndelay, but gains the oscillations in the reflection spectrum. The conclusions\nare in agreement with numerical calculations.\n", "  A new numerical method is developed for solution of the Gel'fand - Levitan -\nMarchenko inverse scattering integral equations. The method is based on the\nfast inversion procedure of a Toeplitz Hermitian matrix and special bordering\ntechnique. The method is highly competitive with the known discrete layer\npeeling method in speed and exceeds it noticeably in accuracy at high\nreflectance.\n", "  The accuracy of calculation of spectral line shapes in one-dimensional\napproximation is studied analytically in several limiting cases for arbitrary\ncollision kernel and numerically in the rigid spheres model. It is shown that\nthe deviation of the line profile is maximal in the center of the line in case\nof large perturber mass and intermediate values of collision frequency. For\nmoderate masses of buffer molecules the error of one-dimensional approximation\nis found not to exceed 5%.\n", "  The metric structure of homogeneous spaces of rank-one and rank-two\nassociated to the real pseudo-orthogonal groups SO(p,q) and some of their\ncontractions (e.g., ISO(p,q), Newton-Hooke type groups...) is studied. All\nthese spaces are described from a unified setting following a Cayley-Klein\nscheme allowing to simultaneously study the main features of their Riemannian,\npesudoRiemannian and semiRiemannian metrics, as well as of their curvatures.\nSome of the rank-one spaces are naturally interpreted as spacetime models.\nLikewise, the same natural interpretation for rank-two spaces is as spaces of\nlines in rank-one spaces; through this relation these rank-two spaces give rise\nto homogeneous phase space models. The main features of the phase spaces for\nhomogeneous spacetimes are analysed.\n", "  We introduce three \"Cayley-Klein\" families of Lie algebras through\nrealizations in terms of either real, complex or quaternionic matrices. Each\nfamily includes simple as well as some limiting quasi-simple real Lie algebras.\nTheir relationships naturally lead to an infinite family of $3\\times 3$\nFreudenthal-like magic squares, which relate algebras in the three CK families.\nIn the lowest dimensional cases suitable extensions involving octonions are\npossible, and for $N=1, 2$, the \"classical\" $3\\times 3$ Freudenthal-like\nsquares admit a $4\\times 4$ extension, which gives the original Freudenthal\nsquare and the Sudbery square.\n", "  The profile of a Bennett hole induced by laser field in ionic distribution in\ncollisional plasma is calculated. Influence of Chandrasekhar's dependence of\ncoefficients of velocity space transport on the profile is included into the\ncalculation for the first time. It is found that the hole narrows down as the\nfield detuning frequency increases. Physical cause of the effect is the falling\ndependence of Coulomb collision frequency on the ionic velocity. Estimations\nshow that the effect is quite observable under conditions of high-current\ngas-discharge plasma.\n"]}
