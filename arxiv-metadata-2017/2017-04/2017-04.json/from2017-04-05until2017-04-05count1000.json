specifically\ndesigned to take advantage of the upgraded WSRT. The instrument is based on a\ncomputer cluster running the Linux operating system, with minimal custom\nhardware. A maximum of 160 MHz analogue bandwidth sampled as 8X20 MHz subbands\nwith 8-bit resolution can be recorded on disks attached to separate computer\nnodes. Processing of the data is done in the additional 32-nodes allowing near\nreal time coherent dedispersion for most pulsars observed at the WSRT. This has\ndoubled the bandwidth for pulsar observations in general, and has enabled the\nuse of coherent dedispersion over a bandwidth eight times larger than was\npreviously possible at the WSRT. PuMa II is one of the widest bandwidth\ncoherent dedispersion machines currently in use and has a maximum time\nresolution of 50ns. The system is now routinely used for high precision pulsar\ntiming studies, polarization studies, single pulse work and a variety of other\nobservational work.\n", "  We consider here the non-adiabatic energy transfer dynamics for a model\nbi-chromophore system consisting of a perylenediimide unit linked to a\nladder-type poly-(para-phenylene) oligomer. Starting from a semi-empirical\nparameterization of a model electron/phonon Hamiltonian, we compute the\ngolden-rule rate for energy transfer from the LPPP5 donor to the PDI acceptor.\nOur results indicate that the non-adiabatic transfer is promoted by the\nout-of-plane wagging modes of the C-H bonds even though theses modes give\nlittle or no contribution to the Franck Condon factors in this system. We also\npredict a kinetic isotope effect of $k^{(H)}/k^{(D)} = 1.7 - 2.5$ depending\nupon the temperature.\n", "  The decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) during the initial growth of\nsolid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) films at the solvent-graphitic anode\ninterface is critical to lithium ion battery operations. Ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations of explicit liquid EC/graphite interfaces are conducted to\nstudy these electrochemical reactions. We show that carbon edge terminations\nare crucial at this stage, and that achievable experimental conditions can lead\nto surprisingly fast EC breakdown mechanisms, yielding decomposition products\nseen in experiments but not previously predicted.\n", "  We present an improved method to compute the radiative momentum transfer in\nthe Pioneer 10 & 11 spacecraft that takes into account both diffusive and\nspecular reflection. The method allows for more reliable results regarding the\nthermal acceleration of the deep-space probes, confirming previous findings. A\nparametric analysis is performed in order to set an upper and lower-bound for\nthe thermal acceleration and its evolution with time.\n", "  A summary account of the conference \"Fusion11\", held in Saint Malo, France,\nMay 2-6, 2011.\n", "  Enhancement of nuclear pasta formation due to multi-nucleus simultaneous\ncollision is presented based on time-dependent density functional calculations\nwith periodic boundary condition. This calculation corresponds to the situation\nwith density lower than the known low-density existence limit of the nuclear\npasta phase. In order to evaluate the contribution from three-nucleus\nsimultaneous collisions inside the cosmic matter, the possibility of\nmulti-nucleus simultaneous collisions is examined by a systematic Monte-Carlo\ncalculation, and the mean free path of a nucleus is obtained. Consequently the\nlow-density existence limit of the nuclear pasta phase is formed to be lower\nthan believed up to now.\n", "  We develop a theory of collective phase description for globally coupled\nnoisy excitable elements exhibiting macroscopic oscillations. Collective phase\nequations describing macroscopic rhythms of the system are derived from\nLangevin-type equations of globally coupled active rotators via a nonlinear\nFokker-Planck equation. The theory is an extension of the conventional phase\nreduction method for ordinary limit cycles to limit-cycle solutions in\ninfinite-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the time-periodic solutions to\nnonlinear Fokker-Planck equations representing macroscopic rhythms. We\ndemonstrate that the type of the collective phase sensitivity function near the\nonset of collective oscillations crucially depends on the type of the\nbifurcation, namely, it is type-I for the saddle-node bifurcation and type-II\nfor the Hopf bifurcation.\n", "  Many imaging applications require increasingly bright illumination sources,\nmotivating the replacement of conventional thermal light sources with light\nemitting diodes (LEDs), superluminescent diodes (SLDs) and lasers. Despite\ntheir brightness, lasers and SLDs are poorly suited for full-field imaging\napplications because their high spatial coherence leads to coherent artifacts\nknown as speckle that corrupt image formation. We recently demonstrated that\nrandom lasers can be engineered to provide low spatial coherence. Here, we\nexploit the low spatial coherence of specifically-designed random lasers to\nperform speckle-free full-field imaging in the setting of significant optical\nscattering. We quantitatively demonstrate that images generated with random\nlaser illumination exhibit higher resolution than images generated with\nspatially coherent illumination. By providing intense laser illumination\nwithout the drawback of coherent artifacts, random lasers are well suited for a\nhost of full-field imaging applications from full-field microscopy to digital\nlight projector systems.\n", "  The kinetics and thermodynamics of structural transformations under pressure\ndepend strongly on particle size due to the influence of surface free energy.\nBy suitable design of surface structure, composition, and passivation it is\npossible, in principle, to prepare nanocrystals in structures inaccessible to\nbulk materials. However, few realizations of such extreme size-dependent\nbehavior exist. Here we show with molecular dynamics computer simulation that\nin a model of CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals the core high pressure structure\ncan be made metastable under ambient conditions by tuning the thickness of the\nshell. In nanocrystals with thick shells, we furthermore observe a wurtzite to\nNiAs transformation, which does not occur in the pure bulk materials. These\nphenomena are linked to a fundamental change in the atomistic transformation\nmechanism from heterogenous nucleation at the surface to homogenous nucleation\nin the crystal core. Our results suggest a new route towards expanding the\nrange of available nanoscale materials.\n", "  The phase diagram of water has been calculated for the TIP4PQ/2005 model, an\nempirical rigid non-polarisable model. The path integral Monte Carlo technique\nwas used, permitting the incorporation of nuclear quantum effects. The\ncoexistence lines were traced out using the Gibbs-Duhem integration method,\nonce having calculated the free energies of the liquid and solid phases in the\nquantum limit, which were obtained via thermodynamic integration from the\nclassical value by scaling the mass of the water molecule. The resulting phase\ndiagram is qualitatively correct, being displaced to lower temperatures by\n15-20K. It is found that the influence of nuclear quantum effects are\ncorrelated to the tetrahedral order parameter.\n", "  In this paper we present new empirical radio surface brightness-to-diameter\n({\\Sigma} - D) relations for supernova remnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy. We also\npresent new theoretical derivations of the {\\Sigma} - D relation based on\nequipartition or on constant ratio between cosmic rays and magnetic field\nenergy. A new calibration sample of 60 Galactic SNRs with independently\ndetermined distances is created. Instead of (standard) vertical regression,\nused in previous papers, different fitting procedures are applied to the\ncalibration sample in the log {\\Sigma} - log D plane. Non-standard regressions\nare used to satisfy the requirement that values of parameters obtained from the\nfitting of {\\Sigma} - D and D - {\\Sigma} relations should be invariant within\nestimated uncertainties. We impose symmetry between {\\Sigma} - D and D -\n{\\Sigma} due to the existence of large scatter in both D and {\\Sigma}. Using\nfour fitting methods which treat {\\Sigma} and D symmetrically, different\n{\\Sigma} - D slopes {\\beta} are obtained for the calibration sample. Monte\nCarlo simulations verify that the slopes of the empirical {\\Sigma} - D relation\nshould be determined by using orthogonal regression, because of its good\nperformance for data sets with severe scatter. The slope derived here ({\\beta}\n= 4.8) is significantly steeper than those derived in previous studies. This\nnew slope is closer to the updated theoretically predicted surface\nbrightness-diameter slope in the radio range for the Sedov phase. We also\nanalyze the empirical {\\Sigma} - D relations for SNRs in the dense environment\nof molecular clouds and for SNRs evolving in lower-density interstellar medium.\nApplying the new empirical relation to estimate distances of Galactic SNRs\nresults in a dramatically changed distance scale.\n", "  We use geometric algebra techniques to give a synthetic and computationally\nefficient approach to Fierz identities in arbitrary dimensions and signatures,\nthus generalizing previous work. Our approach leads to a formulation which\ndisplays the underlying real, complex or quaternionic structure in an explicit\nand conceptually clear manner and is amenable to implementation in various\nsymbolic computation systems. We illustrate our methods and results with a few\nexamples which display the basic features of the three classes of pin\nrepresentations governing the structure of such identities in various\ndimensions and signatures.\n", "  The development of high performance transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) is\ncritical to many technologies from transparent electronics to solar cells.\nWhile n-type TCOs are present in many devices, current p-type TCOs are not\nlargely commercialized as they exhibit much lower carrier mobilities, due to\nthe large hole effective masses of most oxides. Here, we conduct a\nhigh-throughput computational search on thousands of binary and ternary oxides\nand identify several highly promising compounds displaying exceptionally low\nhole effective masses (up to an order of magnitude lower than state of the art\np-type TCOs) as well as wide band gaps. In addition to the discovery of\nspecific compounds, the chemical rationalization of our findings opens new\ndirections, beyond current Cu-based chemistries, for the design and development\nof future p-type TCOs.\n", "  In this paper we lay down the foundations for a purely Newtonian theory of\ncosmology, valid at scales small compared with the Hubble radius, using only\nNewtonian point particles acted on by gravity and a possible cosmological term.\nWe describe the cosmological background which is given by an exact solution of\nthe equations of motion in which the particles expand homothetically with their\ncomoving positions constituting a central configuration. We point out, using\nprevious work, that an important class of central configurations are\nhomogeneous and isotropic, thus justifying the usual assumptions of elementary\ntreatments. The scale factor is shown to satisfy the standard Raychaudhuri and\nFriedmann equations without making any fluid dynamic or continuum\napproximations. Since we make no commitment as to the identity of the point\nparticles, our results are valid for cold dark matter, galaxies, or clusters of\ngalaxies. In future publications we plan to discuss perturbations of our\ncosmological background from the point particle viewpoint laid down in this\npaper and show consistency with much standard theory usually obtained by more\ncomplicated and conceptually less clear continuum methods. Apart from its\npotential use in large scale structure studies, we believe that out approach\nhas great pedagogic advantages over existing elementary treatments of the\nexpanding universe, since it requires no use of general relativity or continuum\nmechanics but concentrates on the basic physics: Newton's laws for\ngravitationally interacting particles.\n", "  In this article, we introduce a novel backward method to model stochastic\ngene expression and protein level dynamics. The protein amount is regarded as a\ndiffusion process and is described by a backward stochastic differential\nequation (BSDE). Unlike many other SDE techniques proposed in the literature,\nthe BSDE method is backward in time; that is, instead of initial conditions it\nrequires the specification of endpoint (\"final\") conditions, in addition to the\nmodel parametrization. To validate our approach we employ Gillespie's\nstochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) to generate (forward) benchmark data,\naccording to predefined gene network models. Numerical simulations show that\nthe BSDE method is able to correctly infer the protein level distributions that\npreceded a known final condition, obtained originally from the forward SSA.\nThis makes the BSDE method a powerful systems biology tool for time reversed\nsimulations, allowing, for example, the assessment of the biological conditions\n(e.g. protein concentrations) that preceded an experimentally measured event of\ninterest (e.g. mitosis, apoptosis, etc.).\n", "  We report on the observation of anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in\nvertical asymmetric nano-contacts (NCs) made through AlO$_x$ nano-oxide layer\n(NOL) formed by ion-assisted oxidation method in the film stack of\nCo/AlO$_x$-NOL/Pt. Analysis of NC formation was based on \\emph{in situ}\nconductive atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.\nDepending on the purity of NCs from Al contamination, we observed up to 29% AMR\nratio at room temperature.\n", "  Using Thomas-Fermi (TF) and Thomas-Fermi-Dirac (TFD) models, we have\ninvestigated the properties of electron gas inside two-dimensional (2D)\nWigner-Seitz (WS) cells in presence of a strong orthogonal quantizing magnetic\nfield. The electron-electron Coulomb exchange interaction in quasi-2D case is\nobtained. The exact form of exchange term in 2D is derived making the width of\nthe system tending to zero. Further, using the exchange term, the\nThomas-Fermi-Dirac equation in 2D is established. It has been observed that\nonly the ionized WS cell can have finite radius in the Thomas-Fermi model, even\nin presence of a strong quantizing magnetic field. On the other hand, in the\nThomas-Fermi-Dirac model a neutral WS cell can have finite radius.\n", "  We introduce a framework to intertwine dynamical processes of different\nnature, each with its own distinct network topology, using a multilayer network\napproach. As an example of collective phenomena emerging from the interactions\nof multiple dynamical processes, we study a model where neural dynamics and\nnutrient transport are bidirectionally coupled in such a way that the\nallocation of the transport process at one layer depends on the degree of\nsynchronization at the other layer, and vice versa. We show numerically, and we\nprove analytically, that the multilayer coupling induces a spontaneous\nexplosive synchronization and a heterogeneous distribution of allocations,\notherwise not present in the two systems considered separately. Our framework\ncan find application to other cases where two or more dynamical processes such\nas synchronization, opinion formation, information diffusion, or disease\nspreading, are interacting with each other.\n", "  Breast cancer has been reported to account for the maximum cases among all\nfemale cancers till date. In order to gain a deeper insight into the\ncomplexities of the disease, we analyze the breast cancer network and its\nnormal counterpart at the proteomic level. While the short range correlations\nin the eigenvalues exhibiting universality provide an evidence towards the\nimportance of random connections in the underlying networks, the long range\ncorrelations along with the localization properties reveal insightful\nstructural patterns involving functionally important proteins. The analysis\nprovides a benchmark for designing drugs which can target a subgraph instead of\nindividual proteins.\n", "  We conducted theoretical and numerical investigations of the optical\nrectification (OR) effect in metallic structures with periodic modulation. A\nnew formulation of the OR effect is presented, and the mechanism by which the\nOR effect is generated, which has been a controversial issue in previous\nstudies, is clarified. We reveal that the OR effect is strongly enhanced by a\ncombination of spatial variation of the metallic structure and local electric\nfield enhancement. Our theory was numerically evaluated and agreed fairly well\nwith experiment.\n", "  Are spinodal instabilities the leading mechanism in the fragmentation of a\nfermionic system? Numerous experimental indications suggest such a scenario and\nstimulated much effort in giving a suitable description, without being\nfinalised in a dedicated transport model.\n  On the one hand, the bulk character of spinodal behaviour requires an\naccurate treatment of the one-body dynamics, in presence of mechanical\ninstabilities. On the other hand, pure mean-field implementations do not apply\nto situations where instabilities, bifurcations and chaos are present. The\nevolution of instabilities should be treated in a large-amplitude framework\nrequiring fluctuations of Langevin type.\n  We present new stochastic approaches constructed by requiring a thorough\ndescription of the mean-field response in presence of instabilities. Their\nparticular relevance is an improved description of the spinodal fragmentation\nmechanism at the threshold, where the instability growth is frustrated by the\nmean-field resilience.\n", "  We intend to provide a consistent description of the even-even Hg isotopes,\n172-200Hg, using the interacting boson model including configuration mixing. We\npay special attention to the description of the shape of the nuclei and to its\nconnection with the shape coexistence phenomenon.\n", "  The pygmy-dipole resonances and photon strength functions in stable and\nunstable Ni and Sn isotopes are calculated within the microscopic\nself-consistent version of the extended theory of finite fermi systems which\nincludes the QRPA and phonon coupling effects and uses the known Skyrme forces\nSLy4. The pygmy dipole resonance in $^{72}Ni$ is predicted with the mean energy\nof 12.4 MeV and the energy-weighted sum rule exhausting 25.6\\% of the total\nstrength. The microscopically obtained photon E1 strength functions are used to\ncalculate nuclear reaction properties, i.e the radiative neutron capture cross\nsection, gamma-ray spectra, and average radiative widths. Our main conclusion\nis that in all these quantities it is necessary to take the phonon coupling\neffects into account.\n", "  This work presents an approach to nuclear spin-isospin response, which is\ncapable of describing the overall strength distribution up to high excitation\nenergies, including the fine structure of the low-lying strength, and resolving\nthe long-standing quenching problem. The model is a covariant realization of\nthe nuclear field theory and based on the self-consistent extensions of the\ncovariant energy density functional (CEDF) theory. Results of the recent\ncalculations for spin-isospin response of ordinary and exotic medium-mass\nnuclei are presented and discussed.\n", "  In order to produce intrinsic rotation, bulk plasmas must be collectively\naccelerated by the net force exerted on them, which results from both driving\nand damping forces. So, to study the possible mechanisms of intrinsic rotation\ngeneration, it is only needed to understand characteristics of driving and\ndamping terms because the toroidal driving and damping forces induce net\nacceleration which generates intrinsic rotation. Experiments were performed on\nEAST and J-TEXT for ohmic plasmas with net counter- and co-current toroidal\nacceleration generated by density ramping up and ramping down. Additionally on\nEAST, net co-current toroidal acceleration was also formed by LHCD or ICRF. For\nthe current experimental results, toroidal acceleration was between - 50 km/s^2\nin counter-current direction and 70 km/s^2 in co-current direction. According\nto toroidal momentum equation, toroidal electric field (E\\-(\\g(f))),\nelectron-ion toroidal friction, and toroidal viscous force etc. may play roles\nin the evolution of toroidal rotation. To evaluate contribution of each term,\nwe first analyze characteristics of E\\-(\\g(f)). E\\-(\\g(f)) is one of the\nco-current toroidal forces that acts on the plasma as a whole and persists for\nthe entire discharge period. It was shown to drive the co-current toroidal\nacceleration at a magnitude of 10^3 km/s^2, which was much larger than the\nexperimental toroidal acceleration observed on EAST and J-TEXT. So E\\-(\\g(f))\nis one of co-current forces producing cocurrent intrinsic toroidal acceleration\nand rotation. Meanwhile, it indicates that there must be a strong\ncounter-current toroidal acceleration resulting from counter-current toroidal\nforces. Electron-ion toroidal friction is one of the counter-current toroidal\nforces because global electrons move in the counter-current direction in order\nto produce a toroidal plasma current.\n", "  Elliptic flow signals the presence of multiple interactions between the\nconstituents of the created matter in heavy-ion collisions. This includes\npossible contributions from the different phases, including the hadronic phase.\nIn these proceedings I will first show that the energy dependence of elliptic\nflow, based on recent ALICE and STAR beam energy scan measurements, can largely\nbe understood in terms of a boosted thermal system. In addition, a detailed\ncomparison between the identified particle elliptic flow measured by the ALICE\ncollaboration and viscous hydrodynamical model calculations with and without a\nhadronic afterburner is performed to constrain the possible effects of\nindividual hadron-hadron re-interaction cross-sections.\n", "  In this article, we propose a mathematical model which explains the formation\nof strong bonds during the relaxation process of a soft solid on a hard\nsurface. As a result, the soft solid relaxes to a non zero residual stress\nlevel. The model assumes that formation of strong bonds occurs owing to\ntransition from weak to strong bonds at a critical time. Parametric studies are\ncarried out to understand the effect of different friction parameters related\nwith the model on the relaxation process. The relaxation model is, in turn,\nvalidated with experiments and corresponding numerical values are justified.\n", "  Transparent oxides are essential building blocks to many technologies,\nranging from components in transparent electronics, transparent conductors, to\nabsorbers and protection layers in photovoltaics and photoelectrochemical\ndevices. However, thus far, it has been difficult to develop p-type oxides with\nwide band gap and high hole mobility; current state-of-art transparent p-type\noxides have hole mobility in the range of < 10 cm$^2$/Vs, much lower than their\nn-type counterparts. Using high-throughput computational screening to guide the\ndiscovery of novel oxides with wide band gap and high hole mobility, we report\nthe computational identification and the experimental verification of a\nbismuth-based double-perovskite oxide that meets these requirements. Our\nidentified candidate, Ba$_2$BiTaO$_6$, has an optical band gap larger than 4 eV\nand a Hall hole mobility above 30 cm$^2$/Vs. We rationalize this finding with\nmolecular orbital intuitions; Bi$^{3+}$ with filled s-orbitals strongly overlap\nwith the oxygen p, increasing the extent of the metal-oxygen covalency and\neffectively reducing the valence effective mass, while Ta$^{5+}$ forms a\nconduction band with low electronegativity, leading to a high band gap beyond\nthe visible range. Our concerted theory-experiment effort points to the growing\nutility of a data-driven materials discovery and the combination of both\ninformatics and chemical intuitions as a way to discover future technological\nmaterials.\n", "  We discuss the behavior of dynamically-generated charmed baryonic resonances\nin matter within a unitarized coupled-channel model consistent with heavy-quark\nspin symmetry. We analyze the implications for the formation of $D$-meson bound\nstates in nuclei and the propagation of $D$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions from\nRHIC to FAIR energies.\n", "  Various explanations of the anomalous proton to pion ratio at the LHC are\ndiscussed. The special emphasis is set on the Cracow thermal model with single\nfreeze-out. This model allows to get a good agreement for both the mean hadron\nmultiplicities and the spectra. Moreover, the values of the fit parameters\nindicate the possibility of pion Bose condensation in the most central\ncollisions at the LHC. Therefore, a modification of the thermal framework is\nproposed that explicitly allows for the condensation in the ground state. The\ngeneralised model makes a link between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermal\nmodels. It also suggests that the pion condensation may be formed in the\ncentral collisions.\n", "  The use of large, X-ray selected galaxy cluster catalogues for cosmological\nanalyses requires a thorough understanding of the X-ray mass estimates. Weak\ngravitational lensing is an ideal method to shed light on such issues, due to\nits insensitivity to the cluster dynamical state. We perform a weak lensing\ncalibration of 166 galaxy clusters from the REFLEX and BCS cluster catalogue\nand compare our results to the X-ray masses based on scaled luminosities from\nthat catalogue. To interpret the weak lensing signal in terms of cluster\nmasses, we compare the lensing signal to simple theoretical Navarro-Frenk-White\nmodels and to simulated cluster lensing profiles, including complications such\nas cluster substructure, projected large-scale structure, and Eddington bias.\nWe find evidence of underestimation in the X-ray masses, as expected, with\n$\\langle M_{\\mathrm{X}}/M_{\\mathrm{WL}}\\rangle = 0.75 \\pm 0.07$ stat. $\\pm\n0.05$ sys. for our best-fit model. The biases in cosmological parameters in a\ntypical cluster abundance measurement that ignores this mass bias will\ntypically exceed the statistical errors.\n", "  The interpretation of quark ($q$)- antiquark ($\\bar q$) pairs production and\nthe sequential string breaking as tunneling through the event horizon of colour\nconfinement leads to a thermal hadronic spectrum with a universal Unruh\ntemperature, $T \\simeq 165$ Mev,related to the quark acceleration, $a$, by\n$T=a/2\\pi$. The resulting temperature depends on the quark mass and then on the\ncontent of the produced hadrons, causing a deviation from full equilibrium and\nhence a suppression of strange particle production in elementary collisions. In\nnucleus-nucleus collisions, where the quark density is much bigger, one has to\nintroduce an average temperature (acceleration) which dilutes the quark mass\neffect and the strangeness suppression almost disappears.\n", "  Spin-torque oscillators are strong candidates as nano-scale microwave\ngenerators and detectors. However, because of large amplitude-phase coupling\n(non-linearity), phase noise is enhanced over other linear auto-oscillators.\nOne way to reduce nonlinearity is to use ferromagnetic layers as a resonator\nand excite them at localized spots, making a resonator-excitor pair. We\ninvestigated the excitation of oscillations in dipole-coupled ferromagnetic\nlayers, driven by localized current at ferromagnetic nano-contacts.\nOscillations possessed properties of optical-mode spin-waves and at low field\n($\\approx$200 Oe) had high frequency (15 GHz), a moderate precession amplitude\n(2--3$^\\circ$), and a narrow spectral linewidth ($<$3 MHz) due to localized\nexcitation at nano-contacts. Micromagnetic simulation showed emission of\nresonator's characteristic optical-mode spin-waves from disturbances generated\nby domain-wall oscillations at nano-contacts.\n", "  There exist two formulations for quantum heat engine that models an energy\ntransfer between two microscopic systems. One is semi-classical scenario, and\nthe other is full quantum scenario. The former is formulated as a unitary\nevolution for the internal system, and is adopted by the community of\nstatistical mechanics. In the latter, the whole process is formulated as\nunitary, and is adopted by the community of quantum information. This paper\nproposes a model for quantum heat engine that transfers energy from a\ncollection of microscopic systems to a macroscopic system like a fuel cell. In\nsuch a situation, the amount of extracted work is visible for a human. For this\npurpose, we formulate quantum heat engine as the measurement process whose\nmeasurement outcome is the amount of extracted work. Under this model, we\nderive a suitable energy conservation law and propose a more concrete submodel.\nThen, we derive a novel trade-off relation between the measurability of the\namount of work extraction and the coherence of the internal system, which\nexamines the application of the semi-classical scenario to a heat engine\ntransferring an energy from a collection of microscopic systems to a\nmacroscopic system.\n", "  We present the results of detailed dielectric investigations of the\nrelaxation dynamics in DyMnO$_3$ multiferroic manganite. Strong low-frequency\nrelaxation process near the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is\nobserved. The high frequency mode is directly to the relaxational motion of\nmultiferroic domain walls. We provide an experimental evidence that this\nrelaxation mode corresponds to a chirality switching of the spin cycloid in\nDyMnO$_3$. We demonstrate that the relaxation dynamics in DyMnO$_3$ is typical\nfor an order-disorder phase transition and may be understood within a simple\nmodel with a double well potential. DyMnO$_3$ follows an order-disorder\ntransition scenario implicating that a short range cycloidal order of Mn-spins\nexists above $T_C$. These results suggest the interpretation of the\nparaelectric sinusoidal phase in manganites as a dynamical equilibrium of\nmagnetic cycloids with opposite chiralities.\n", "  In this communication, based on our paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4186, we\ndiscuss a way of enhancing Gauge/Gravity Duality and response of a dual\nstrongly coupled medium on placing the inhomogeneity on the gravity side.\n", "  In this paper we study the properties of cold bosons in a two-dimensional\noptical lattice system where Bose-condensation occurs at a momentum point k\nwith non-zero k-space Berry curvature. By combining results from both analytic\nand numerical approaches, we show that the boson system carries non-universal,\ntemperature dependent equilibrium angular momentum and edge current at low\ntemperatures.\n", "  The majority of quantum simulators treat simplified one-band strongly\ncorrelated models, whereas multiple bands are needed to describe materials with\nintermediate correlation. We investigate the sensitivity of multiband quantum\nsimulators to: (1) the form of optical lattices (2) the interactions between\nelectron analogues. Since the kinetic energy terms of electron analogues in a\nquantum simulator and electrons in a solid are identical, by examining both\nperiodic potential and interaction we explore the full problem of many-band\nquantum simulators within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Density\nfunctional calculations show that bandstructure is highly sensitive to the form\nof optical lattice, and it is necessary to go beyond sinusoidal potentials to\nensure that the bands closest to the Fermi surface are similar to those in real\nmaterials. Analysis of several electron analogue types finds that dressed\nRydberg atoms (DRAs) have promising interactions for multi band quantum\nsimulation. DRA properties can be chosen so that interaction matrices\napproximate those in real systems and decoherence effects are controlled,\nalbeit with parameters at the edge of currently available technology. We\nconclude that multiband quantum simulators implemented using the principles\nestablished here could provide insight into the complex processes in real\nmaterials.\n", "  It is shown that the correspondence principle and the holographic principle\nare incompatible in the background of an eternal Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter\ngeometry. The argument is based on the observation that algebraic structures of\nlocal quantum field and CFT operators are not equivalent. This implies, in\nparticular, the bulk CFT must be singular near the black-hole horizon. A CFT\nHilbert space representation is elaborated which may correspond to the AdS\nblack hole in the dual theory.\n", "  While dealing in [1] with the supersymmetry of a tridiagonal Hamiltonian H,\nwe have proved that its partner Hamiltonian H(+) also have a tridiagonal matrix\nrepresentation in the same basis and that the polynomials associated with the\neigenstates expansion of H(+) are precisely the kernel polynomials of those\nassociated with H. This formalism is here applied to the case of the Morse\noscillator which may have a finite discrete energy spectrum in addition to a\ncontinuous one. This completes the treatment of tridiagonal Hamiltonians with\npure continuous energy spectrum, a pure discrete one, or a spectrum of mixed\ndiscrete and continous parts.\n", "  First principle modeling of nitrogen- and boron-doped phosphorene\ndemonstrates the tendency toward formation of highly ordered structures.\nNitrogen doping leads to the formation of -N-P-P-P-N- lines. Further\ntransformation to -P-N-P-N- lines across the chains of phosphorene occurs with\nincreasing band gap and increasing nitrogen concentration, which coincides with\nthe decreasing chemical activity of N-doped phosphorene. In contrast to the\ncase of nitrogen, boron atoms prefer to form -B-B- pairs with the further\nformation of -P-P-B-B-P-P- patterns along the phosphorene chains. The low\nconcentration of boron dopants converts the phosphorene from a semiconductor\ninto a semimetal with the simultaneous enhancement of its chemical activity.\nCo-doping of phosphorene by both boron and nitrogen starts from the formation\nof -B-N- pairs, which provide flat bands and the further transformation of\nthese pairs to hexagonal BN lines and ribbons across the phosphorene chains.\n", "  We study the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a convex domain in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, with $n\\geq 2$. In particular, we generalize and improve upper\nbounds for the Riesz means of order $\\sigma\\geq 3/2$ established in an article\nby Geisinger, Laptev and Weidl. This is achieved by refining estimates for a\nnegative second term in the Berezin inequality. The obtained remainder term\nreflects the correct order of growth in the semi-classical limit and depends\nonly on the measure of the boundary of the domain. We emphasize that such an\nimprovement is for general $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ not possible and was\npreviously known to hold only for planar convex domains satisfying certain\ngeometric conditions.\n  As a corollary we obtain lower bounds for the individual eigenvalues\n$\\lambda_k$, which for a certain range of $k$ improves the Li--Yau inequality\nfor convex domains. However, for convex domains one can use different methods\nto obtain even stronger such lower bounds.\n", "  Over the past decades, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecules\nhave become a mainstream biophysics technique. As the length and time scales\namenable to the MD method increase, shortcomings of the empirical force\nfields---which have been developed and validated using relatively short\nsimulations of small molecules---become apparent. One common artifact is\naggregation of water-soluble biomolecules driven by artificially strong\ncharge--charge interactions. Here, we report a systematic refinement of\nLennard-Jones parameters (NBFIX) describing amine--carboxylate and\namine--phosphate interactions, which brings MD simulations of basic\npeptide-mediated nucleic acids assemblies and lipid bilayer membranes in better\nagreement with experiment. As our refinement neither affects the existing\nparameterization of bonded interaction nor does it alter the solvation free\nenergies, it improves realism of an MD simulation without introducing\nadditional artifacts.\n", "  It has recently been claimed that dark matter in form of quark nuggets cannot\naccount for more than 20% of the dark matter density. This claim is based on\nconstraints on the neutrino flux in 20-50 MeV range where the sensitivity of\nunderground neutrino detectors such as Super-Kamiokande have their highest\nsignal-to-noise ratio. We argue that this claim depends crucially on the\nassumption that the annihilation of visible baryons with an antiquark nugget\nwill generate a neutrino spectrum similar to the conventional baryon-antibaryon\nannihilation spectrum in vacuum. However, this assumption does not hold for the\nnuggets in a colour superconducting phase where the lightest pseudo Goldstone\nmesons (the pions and Kaons) have masses in the 20 MeV range, in contrast with\nconventional pion mass of roughly 140 MeV. Thus, the decay of these light\npseudo Goldstone bosons of the CS phase cannot produce highly energetic\nneutrinos in the 20-50 MeV energy range.\n", "  Although time-independent models provide very useful dynamical information\nwith a reduced computational burden, going beyond the quasi-static\napproximation provides enriched information when dealing with TeraHertz (THz)\nfrequencies. In this work, the THz noise of dual-gate graphene transistors with\nDC polarization is analyzed from a careful simulation of the time-dependent\nparticle and displacement currents. From such currents, the power spectral\ndensity (PSD) of the total current fluctuations are computed at the source,\ndrain and gate contacts. The role of the lateral dimensions of the transistors,\nthe Klein tunneling and the positive-negative energy injection on the PSD are\nanalyzed carefully. Through the comparison of the PSD with and without\nBand-to-Band tunneling and graphene injection, it is shown that the unavoidable\nKlein tunneling and positive-negative energy injection in graphene structures\nimply an increment of noise without similar increment on the current, degrading\nthe (either low or high frequency) signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, it is shown\nthat the shorter the vertical height (in comparison with the length of the\nactive region in the transport direction), the larger the maximum frequency of\nthe PSD. As a byproduct of this result, an alternative strategy (without length\nscaling) to optimize the intrinsic cut-off frequency of graphene transistors is\nenvisioned.\n", "  Minimally doubled fermion proposed by Creutz and Borici is a promising chiral\nfermion formulation on lattice. In this work, we present excited state mass\nspectroscopy for the meson bound states in Gross-Neveu model using\nBorici-Creutz fermion. We also evaluate the effective fermion mass as a\nfunction of coupling constant which shows a chiral phase transition at strong\ncoupling. The lowest lying meson in 2-dimensional QED is also obtained using\nBorici-Creutz fermion.\n", "  In the pursuit of ever increasing efficiency and growth, our economies have\nevolved to remarkable degrees of complexity, with nested production processes\nfeeding each other in order to create products of greater sophistication from\nless sophisticated ones, down to raw materials. The engine of such an expansion\nhave been competitive markets that, according to General Equilibrium Theory\n(GET), achieve efficient allocations under specific conditions. We study large\nrandom economies within the GET framework, as templates of complex economies,\nand we find that a non-trivial phase transition occurs: the economy freezes in\na state where all production processes collapse when either the number of\nprimary goods or the number of available technologies fall below a critical\nthreshold. As in other examples of phase transitions in large random systems,\nthis is an unintended consequence of the growth in complexity. Our findings\nsuggest that the Industrial Revolution can be regarded as a sharp transition\nbetween different phases, but also imply that well developed economies can\ncollapse if too many intermediate goods are introduced.\n", "  The effects of size, strain, and vacancies on thermal properties of armchair\nblack phosphorus nanotubes are investigated based on qualitative analysis from\nmolecular dynamics simulations. It is found that the thermal conductivity has a\nremarkable size effect because of the restricted paths for phonon transport,\nstrongly depending on the diameter and length of nanotube. Owing to the\nintensified low-frequency phonons, axial tensile strain can facilitate thermal\ntransport. On the contrary, compressive strain weakens thermal transport due to\nthe enhanced phonon scattering around the buckling of nanotube. In addition,\nthe thermal conductivity is dramatically reduced by single vacancies,\nespecially upon high defect concentrations.\n", "  Coherent Raman scattering spectroscopy is studied purposely, with the\nGaussian ultrashort pulses as a hands-on elucidatory extraction tool of the\nclean coherent Raman resonant spectra from the overall measured data\ncontaminated with the non-resonant four wave mixing background. The integral\nformulae for both the coherent anti-Stokes and Stokes Raman scattering are\ngiven in the semiclassical picture, and the closed-form solutions in terms of a\ncomplex error function are obtained. An analytic form of maximum enhancement of\npure coherent Raman spectra at threshold time delay depending on bandwidth of\nprobe pulse is also obtained. The observed experimental data for pyridine in\nliquid-phase are quantitatively elucidated and the inferred time-resolved\ncoherent Raman resonant results are reconstructed with a new insight.\n", "  In this contribution, typical friction driven structures are summarized and\npresented considering the mechanical structures and operation principles of\ndifferent types of piezoelectric motors. A two degree-of-freedom dynamic model\nwith one unilateral frictional contact is built for one of the friction driven\nstructures. Different contact regimes and the transitions between them are\nidentified and analyzed. Numerical simulations are conducted to find out\ndifferent operation modes of the system concerning the sequence of contact\nregimes in one steady state period. The influences of parameters on the\noperation modes and corresponding steady state characteristics are also\nexplored. Some advice are then given in terms of the design of friction driven\nstructures and piezoelectric motors.\n", "  We calculate the annihilation decay rates of the $^3D_2(2^{--})$ and\n$^3D_3(3^{--})$ charmonia and bottomonia by using the instantaneous\nBethe-Salpeter method. The wave functions of states with quantum numbers\n$J^{PC}=2^{--}$ and $3^{--}$ are constructed. By solving the corresponding\ninstantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equations, we obtain the mass spectra and wave\nfunctions of the quarkonia. The annihilation amplitude is written within\nMandelstam formalism and the relativistic corrections are taken into account\nproperly. This is important, especially for high excited states, since their\nrelativistic corrections are large. The results for the $3g$ channel are as\nfollows: $\\Gamma_{^3D_2(c\\bar c)\\rightarrow ggg} = 9.24$ keV,\n$\\Gamma_{^3D_3(c\\bar c)\\rightarrow ggg}=25.0$ keV, $\\Gamma_{^3D_2(b\\bar\nb)\\rightarrow ggg}= 1.87$ keV, and $\\Gamma_{^3D_3(b\\bar b)\\rightarrow ggg}=\n0.815$ keV.\n", "  We present a scheme to estimate Gaussian states of one-dimensional continuous\nvariable systems, based on weak (unsharp) quantum measurements. The estimation\nof a Gaussian state requires us to find position ($q$), momentum ($p$) and\ntheir second order moments. We measure $q$ weakly and follow it up with a\nprojective measurement of $p$ on half of the ensemble, and on the other half we\nmeasure $p$ weakly followed by a projective measurement of $q$. In each case we\nuse the state twice before discarding it. We compare our results with\nprojective measurements and demonstrate that under certain conditions such weak\nmeasurement-based estimation schemes, where recycling of the states is\npossible, can outperform projective measurement-based state estimation schemes.\n", "  A method for asteroid deflection that makes use of a spacecraft moving back\nand forth on a segment of an appropriate Keplerian orbit about the asteroid is\ndescribed and evaluated. It is shown that, on average, the spacecraft\ndescribing such a trajectory can exert a significantly larger force on the\nasteroid than e.g. a stationary gravity tractor, thereby reducing the time\nneeded to effect a desired velocity change for the asteroid. Furthermore, the\ncurrent method does not require canted thrusters on the spacecraft (unlike a\nstationary gravity tractor), markedly reducing the amount of fuel needed to\ncreate a given change in the asteroid velocity. In addition, the method allows\nfor the simultaneous use of several spacecraft, further strengthening the\noverall tugging effect on the asteroid, and distributing the thrust requirement\namong the spacecraft.\n", "  We consider some examples of superintegrable system which were recently\nisolated through a differential Galois group analysis. The identity of these\nsystems is clarified and the corresponding Poisson algebras derived.\n", "  The damage mechanism induced by laser pulse of different duration in\nborosilicate glass widely used for making confinement geometry targets which\nare important for laser driven shock multiplication and elongation of pressure\npulse, is studied. We measured the front and rear surface damage threshold of\nborosilicate glass and their dependency on laser parameters. In this paper, we\nalso study the thermal effects on the damage diameters, generated at the time\nof plasma formation. These induced damage width, geometries and microstructure\nchanges are measured and analyzed with optical microscope, scanning electron\nmicroscope and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that at low energies\nsymmetrical damages are found and these damage width increases nonlinearly with\nlaser intensity. The emitted optical spectrum during the process of breakdown\nis also investigated and is used for the characterization of emitted plasma\nsuch as plasma temperature and free electron density. Optical emission lines\nfrom Si I at 500 nm, Si II at 385nm and Si III at 455 nm are taken for the\ntemperature calculations.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of the scalar waves in the Witten space-time\ncalled \"bubble of nothing\" and in its remarkable sub-manifold, the Lorentzian\nHawking wormhole. Due to the global hyperbolicity, the global Cauchy problem is\nwell-posed in the functional framework associated with the energy. We perform a\ncomplete spectral analysis that allows to get an explicit form of the solutions\nin terms of special functions. If the effective mass is non zero, the profile\nof the waves is asymptotically almost periodic in time. In contrast, the\nmassless case is dispersive. We develop the scattering theory, classical as\nwell as quantum. The quantized scattering operator leaves invariant the Fock\nvacuum: there is no creation of particles. The resonances can be defined in the\nmassless case and they are purely imaginary.\n", "  Young and massive star clusters above a critical mass form thermally unstable\nclumps reducing locally the temperature and pressure of the hot 10$^{7}$~K\ncluster wind. The matter reinserted by stars, and mass loaded in interactions\nwith pristine gas and from evaporating circumstellar disks, accumulate on\nclumps that are ionized with photons produced by massive stars. We discuss if\nthey may become self-shielded when they reach the central part of the cluster,\nor even before it, during their free fall to the cluster center. Here we\nexplore the importance of heating efficiency of stellar winds.\n", "  Massive stars in young massive clusters insert tremendous amounts of mass and\nenergy into their surroundings in the form of stellar winds and supernova\nejecta. Mutual shock-shock collisions lead to formation of hot gas, filling the\nvolume of the cluster. The pressure of this gas then drives a powerful cluster\nwind. However, it has been shown that if the cluster is massive and dense\nenough, it can evolve in the so--called bimodal regime, in which the hot gas\ninside the cluster becomes thermally unstable and forms dense clumps which are\ntrapped inside the cluster by its gravity. We will review works on the bimodal\nregime and discuss the implications for the formation of subsequent stellar\ngenerations. The mass accumulates inside the cluster and as soon as a high\nenough column density is reached, the interior of the clumps becomes\nself-shielded against the ionising radiation of stars and the clumps collapse\nand form new stars. The second stellar generation will be enriched by products\nof stellar evolution from the first generation, and will be concentrated near\nthe cluster center.\n", "  Quark-hadron phase transition is simulated by an event generator that\nincorporates the dynamical properties of contraction due to QCD confinement\nforces and randomization due to the thermal behavior of a large quark system on\nthe edge of hadronization. Fluctuations of emitted pions in the $(\\eta,\\phi)$\nspace are analyzed using normalized factorial moments in a wide range of bin\nsizes. The scaling index $\\nu$ is found to be very close to the predicted value\nin the Ginzburg-Landau formalism. The erraticity indices $\\mu_q$ are determined\nin a number of ways that lead to the same consistent values. They are compared\nto the values from the Ising model, showing significant difference in a\ntransparent plot. Experimental determination of $\\nu$ and $\\mu_q$ at the LHC\nare now needed to check the reality of the theoretical study and to provide\nguidance for improving the model description of quark-hadron phase transition.\n", "  We generalise the hyper-Kahler/quaternionic Kahler (HK/QK) correspondence to\ninclude para-geometries, and present a new concise proof that the target\nmanifold of the HK/QK correspondence is quaternionic Kahler. As an application,\nwe construct one-parameter deformations of the temporal and Euclidean\nsupergravity c-map metrics and show that they are para-quaternionic Kahler.\n", "  We show that subsets of interacting oscillators may synchronize in different\nways within a single network. This diversity of synchronization patterns is\npromoted by increasing the heterogeneous distribution of coupling weights\nand/or asymmetries in small networks. We also analyze consistency, defined as\nthe persistence of coexistent synchronization patterns regardless of the\ninitial conditions. Our results show that complex weighted networks display\nricher consistency than regular networks, suggesting why certain functional\nnetwork topologies are often constructed when experimental data are analyzed.\n", "  Based on the Sturm-Liouville (SL) eigenvalue problem, we analytically study\nseveral properties of holographic $s$-wave superconductors with exponential\nnonlinear electrodynamics in the background of Schwarzschild anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) black holes. We assume the probe limit in which the scalar and gauge\nfields do not back react on the background metric. We show that for this\nsystem, one can still obtain an analytical relation between the critical\ntemperature and the charge density. Interestingly enough, we find that\nlogarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics decreases the critical temperature,\n$T_c$, of the holographic superconductors compared to the linear Maxwell field.\nThis implies that the nonlinear electrodynamics make the condensation harder.\nThe analytical results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with the\nexisting numerical results. We also compute the critical exponent near the\ncritical temperature and find out that it is still $1/2$ which seems to be an\nuniversal value in mean field theory.\n", "  We present a calculation of the leptonic decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\\pi$ in\n2+1 flavor QCD. Our data set includes five lattice spacings and pion masses\nreaching down below the physical one. Special emphasis is placed on a careful\nstudy of all systematic uncertainties, especially the continuum extrapolation.\nOur result is perfectly compatible with the first-row unitarity constraint of\nthe Standard Model.\n", "  We study the filtering of the perspective of a regular operator map of\nseveral variables through a completely positive linear map. By this method we\nare able to extend known operator inequalities of two variables to several\nvariables; with applications in the theory of operator means of several\nvariables. We also extend Lieb-Ruskai's convexity theorem from two to $ n+1 $\noperator variables.\n", "  We construct candidates for observables in wedge-shaped regions for a class\nof 1+1-dimensional integrable quantum field theories with bound states whose\nS-matrix is diagonal, by extending our previous methods for scalar S-matrices.\nExamples include the Z(N)-Ising models, the A_N-affine Toda field theories and\nsome S-matrices with CDD factors.\n  We show that these candidate operators which are associated with elementary\nparticles commute weakly on a dense domain. For the models with two species of\nparticles, we can take a larger domain of weak commutativity and give an\nargument for the Reeh-Schlieder property.\n", "  We show that integral representation of universal volume function of compact\nsimple Lie groups gives rise to six analytic functions on $CP^2$, which\ntransform as two triplets under group of permutations of Vogel's projective\nparameters. This substitutes expected invariance under permutations of\nuniversal parameters by more complicated covariance. We provide an analytical\ncontinuation of these functions and particularly calculate their change under\npermutations of parameters. This last relation is universal generalization, for\nan arbitrary simple Lie group and an arbitrary point in Vogel's plane, of the\nKinkelin's reflection relation on Barnes' $G(1+N)$ function. Kinkelin's\nrelation gives asymmetry of the $G(1+N)$ function (which is essentially the\nvolume function for $SU(N)$ groups) under $N\\leftrightarrow -N$ transformation\n(which is equivalent of the permutation of parameters, for $SU(N)$ groups), and\ncoincides with universal relation on permutations at the $SU(N)$ line on\nVogel's plane. These results are also applicable to universal partition\nfunction of Chern-Simons theory on three-dimensional sphere. This effect is\nanalogous to modular covariance, instead of invariance, of partition functions\nof appropriate gauge theories under modular transformation of couplings.\n", "  We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on a class of Lorentzian manifolds with\nCauchy surface of bounded geometry, which is shown to include examples such as\nexterior Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter and Kerr-Kruskal spacetimes. In this setup, we\ngive an approximate diagonalization and a microlocal decomposition of the\nCauchy evolution using a time-dependent version of the pseu-dodifferential\ncalculus on Riemannian manifolds of bounded geometry. We apply this result to\nconstruct all pure regular Hadamard states (and associated Feynman inverses),\nwhere regular refers to the state's two-point function having Cauchy data given\nby pseudodifferential operators. This allows us to conclude that there is a\none-parameter family of elliptic pseudodifferential operators that encodes both\nthe choice of (pure, regular) Hadamard state and the underlying spacetime\nmetric.\n", "  A cornerstone of the theory of phase transitions is the observation that\nmany-body systems exhibiting a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the\nthermodynamic limit generally show extensive fluctuations of an order parameter\nin large but finite systems. In this work, we introduce the dynamical analogue\nof such a theory. Specifically, we consider local dissipative dynamics\npreparing a steady-state of quantum spins on a lattice exhibiting a discrete or\ncontinuous symmetry but with extensive fluctuations in a local order parameter.\nWe show that for all such processes satisfying detailed balance, there exist\nmetastable symmetry-breaking states, i.e., states that become stationary in the\nthermodynamic limit and give a finite value to the order parameter. We give\nresults both for discrete and continuous symmetries and explicitly show how to\nconstruct the symmetry-breaking states. Our results show in a simple way that,\nin large systems, local dissipative dynamics satisfying detailed balance cannot\nuniquely and efficiently prepare states with extensive fluctuations with\nrespect to local operators. We discuss the implications of our results for\nquantum simulators and dissipative state preparation.\n", "  In the study the response time of ultrafast transistor and peak transient\ncurrent to prevent melt down of nano-chips, the first principles transient\ncurrent calculation plays an essential role in nanoelectronics. The first\nprinciples calculation of transient current through nano-devices for a period\nof time T is known to be extremely time consuming with the best scaling TN^3\nwhere N is the dimension of the device. In this work, we provide an order O(1)\nalgorithm that reduces the computational complexity to T^0 N^3 for large\nsystems. Benchmark calculation has been done on graphene nanoribbons with N =\n10^4 confirming the O(1) scaling. This breakthrough allows us to tackle many\nlarge scale transient problems including magnetic tunneling junctions and\nferroelectric tunneling junctions that cannot be touched before.\n", "  We present the theory for connecting quantum Markov components into a network\nwith quantum input processes in a Gaussian state (including thermal and\nsqueezed), not necessarily vacuum fields.One would expect on physical grounds\nthat the connection rules should be independent of the state of the input to\nthe network. To compute statistical properties, we use a version of Wicks'\nTheorem involving fictitious vacuum fields (Fock space based representation of\nthe fields) and while this aids computation, and gives a rigorous formulation,\nthe various representations need not be unitarily equivalent. In particular, a\nnaive application of the connection rules would lead to the wrong answer. We\nestablish the correct interconnection rules, and show that while the quantum\nstochastic differential equations of motion display explicitly the covariances\n(thermal and squeezing parameters) of the Gaussian input fields We introduce\nthe Wick-Stratonovich form which leads to a way of writing these equations that\ndoes not depend on these covariances and so corresponds to the universal\nequations written in terms of formal quantum input processes. We show that a\nwholly consistent theory of quantum open systems in series can be developed in\nthis way, and as required physically, is universal and in particular\nrepresentation-free.\n", "  It is demonstrated that targets with a broken rotational symmetry may\nfacilitate generation of a strong axial (poloidal) magnetic field. An intense\nlaser beam irradiating such a target creates intense electron currents carrying\nvorticity and producing strong spontaneous magnetic fields. Combined with a\nlaser electron acceleration, such targets may be used for generation and\nguiding of magnetized, collimated particle or plasma beams.\n", "  We propose the synthesis of frequency dispersion of layered structures based\non the design of multi-ordered optical filters using nanocircuit concepts.\nFollowing the well known insertion loss method commonly employed in the design\nof electronic and microwave filters, here we theoretically show how we can\ntailor optical dispersion as we carry out the design of several low-pass,\nhigh-pass, band-pass and band-stop filters of different order with a (maximally\nflat) Butterworth response. We numerically demonstrate that these filters can\nbe designed by combining metasurfaces made of one or two materials acting as\noptical lumped elements, and, hence, leading to simple, easy to apply, design\nrules. The theoretical results based on this circuital approach are validated\nwith full-wave numerical simulations. The results presented here can be\nextended to virtually any frequency dispersion synthesis, filter design\nprocedure and/or functionality, thus opening up exciting possibilities in the\ndesign of composite materials with on-demand dispersion and high-performance\nand compact optical filters using one or two materials.\n", "  In Advanced LIGO, detection and astrophysical source parameter estimation of\nthe binary black hole merger GW150914 requires a calibrated estimate of the\ngravitational-wave strain sensed by the detectors. Producing an estimate from\neach detector's differential arm length control loop readout signals requires\napplying time domain filters, which are designed from a frequency domain model\nof the detector's gravitational-wave response. The gravitational-wave response\nmodel is determined by the detector's opto-mechanical response and the\nproperties of its feedback control system. The measurements used to validate\nthe model and characterize its uncertainty are derived primarily from a\ndedicated photon radiation pressure actuator, with cross-checks provided by\noptical and radio frequency references. We describe how the gravitational-wave\nreadout signal is calibrated into equivalent gravitational-wave-induced strain\nand how the statistical uncertainties and systematic errors are assessed.\nDetector data collected over 38 calendar days, from September 12 to October 20,\n2015, contain the event GW150914 and approximately 16 of coincident data used\nto estimate the event false alarm probability. The calibration uncertainty is\nless than 10% in magnitude and 10 degrees in phase across the relevant\nfrequency band 20 Hz to 1 kHz.\n", "  We study spin wave excitations in a three-dimensional nanocomposite magnet of\nexchange coupled hard (SmCo$_5$) and soft (FeCo) phases. The dipolar\ninteraction splits the spin wave energies into the upper and lower branches of\nthe spin wave manifold. When the amount of the soft phase is increased the\nenergy of low-lying spin excitations is considerably softened due to two\nreasons: (i) the low- lying mode locked into the soft phase region with a spin\nwave gap at ${\\bf k}= 0$ which scales approximately proportional to the\nanisotropy constant of the soft phase and (ii) the internal dipolar field which\ncomes from magnetic charges forming at hard-soft boundaries with normals\nparallel to the magnetization displaces the spin wave manifold toward the lower\nenergies. With adding more soft phase the spin wave gap closes and the system\nmoves to another ground state characterized by the magnetization mismatch\nbetween spins of the hard and soft phases.\n", "  The so called $q$-triplets were conjectured in 2004 and then found in nature\nin 2005. A relevant further step was achieved in 2005 when the possibility was\nadvanced that they could reflect an entire infinite algebra based on\ncombinations of the self-dual relations $q \\to 2-q$ ({\\it additive duality})\nand $q \\to 1/q$ ({\\it multiplicative duality}). The entire algebra collapses\ninto the single fixed point $q=1$, corresponding to the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy\nand statistical mechanics. For $q \\ne 1$, an infinite set of indices $q$\nappears, corresponding in principle to an infinite number of physical\nproperties of a given complex system describable in terms of the so called\n$q$-statistics. The basic idea that is put forward is that, for a given\nuniversality class of systems, a small number (typically one or two) of\nindependent $q$ indices exist, the infinite others being obtained from these\nfew ones by simply using the relations of the algebra. The $q$-triplets appear\nto constitute a few central elements of the algebra. During the last decade, an\nimpressive amount of $q$-triplets have been exhibited in analytical,\ncomputational, experimental and observational results in natural, artificial\nand social systems. Some of them do satisfy the available algebra constructed\nsolely with the additive and multiplicative dualities, but some others seem to\nviolate it. In the present work we generalize those two dualities with the hope\nthat a wider set of systems can be handled within. The basis of the\ngeneralization is given by the {\\it selfdual} relation $q \\to q_a(q) \\equiv\n\\frac{(a+2) -aq}{a-(a-2)q} \\,\\, (a \\in {\\cal R})$. We verify that $q_a(1)=1$,\nand that $q_2(q)=2-q$ and $q_0(q)=1/q$. To physically motivate this\ngeneralization, we briefly review illustrative applications of $q$-statistics,\nin order to exhibit possible candidates where the present generalized algebras\ncould be useful.\n", "  We report the neutrino mass hierarchy (MH) sensitivity of medium baseline\nreactor neutrino experiments with multiple detectors. Sensitivity of\ndetermining the MH can be significantly improved by adding a near detector and\ncombining both the near and far detectors. The size of the sensitivity\nimprovement is related to accuracy of the individual mass-splitting\nmeasurements and requires strict control on the relative energy scale\nuncertainty of the near and far detectors. We study the impact of both baseline\nand target mass of the near detector on the combined sensitivity. A\nfigure-of-merit is defined to optimize the baseline and target mass of the near\ndetector and the optimal selections are $\\sim$13~km and $\\sim$4~kton\nrespectively for a far detector with the 20~kton target mass and 52.5~km\nbaseline. As typical examples of future medium baseline reactor neutrino\nexperiments, the optimal location and target mass of the near detector are\nselected for JUNO and RENO-50. Finally, we discuss distinct effects of the\nneutrino spectrum uncertainty for setups of a single detector and double\ndetectors, which indicate that the spectrum uncertainty can be well constrained\nin the presence of the near detector.\n", "  It is shown that the tridiagonalization of the hypergeometric operator $L$\nyields the generic Heun operator $M$. The algebra generated by the operators\n$L,M$ and $Z=[L,M]$ is quadratic and a one-parameter generalization of the\nRacah algebra. The new Racah-Heun orthogonal polynomials are introduced as\noverlap coefficients between the eigenfunctions of the operators $L$ and $M$.\nAn interpretation in terms of the Racah problem for $su(1,1)$ algebras and\nseparation of variables in a superintegrable system are discussed.\n", "  We consider Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators on $L^{2}({\\mathbb R}^{d})\\otimes\nL^{2}({\\mathbb R}^{\\ell})$ of the form $ H_{\\omega}~=~H_{\\perp}\\otimes\nI_{\\parallel} + I_{\\perp} \\otimes {H_\\parallel} + V_{\\omega}$, where\n$H_{\\perp}$ and $H_{\\parallel}$ are Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators on\n$L^{2}({\\mathbb R}^{d})$ and $L^{2}({\\mathbb R}^{\\ell})$ respectively, and $\nV_\\omega(x,y)$ : = $\\sum_{\\xi \\in {\\mathbb Z}^{d}} \\lambda_\\xi(\\omega) v(x -\n\\xi, y)$, $x \\in {\\mathbb R}^d$, $y \\in {\\mathbb R}^\\ell$, is a random 'surface\npotential'. We investigate the behavior of the integrated density of surface\nstates of $H_{\\omega}$ near the bottom of the spectrum and near internal band\nedges. The main result of the current paper is that, under suitable\nassumptions, the behavior of the integrated density of surface states of\n$H_{\\omega}$ can be read off from the integrated density of states of a reduced\nHamiltonian $H_{\\perp}+W_{\\omega}$ where $W_{\\omega}$ is a quantum mechanical\naverage of $V_{\\omega}$ with respect to $y \\in {\\mathbb R}^\\ell$. We are\nparticularly interested in cases when $H_{\\perp}$ is a magnetic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperator, but we also recover some of the results from [24] for non-magnetic\n$H_{\\perp}$.\n", "  We provide exact solutions of the Stokes equations for a squirming sphere\nclose to a no-slip surface, both planar and spherical, and for the interactions\nbetween two squirmers, in three dimensions. These allow the hydrodynamic\ninteractions of swimming microscopic organisms with confining boundaries, or\neach other, to be determined for arbitrary separation and, in particular, in\nthe close proximity regime where approximate methods based on point singularity\ndescriptions cease to be valid. We give a detailed description of the circular\nmotion of an arbitrary squirmer moving parallel to a no-slip spherical boundary\nor flat free surface at close separation, finding that the circling generically\nhas opposite sense at free surfaces and at solid boundaries. While the\nasymptotic interaction is symmetric under head-tail reversal of the swimmer, in\nthe near field microscopic structure can result in significant asymmetry. We\nalso find the translational velocity towards the surface for a simple model\nwith only the lowest two squirming modes. By comparing these to asymptotic\napproximations of the interaction we find that the transition from near- to\nfar-field behaviour occurs at a separation of about two swimmer diameters.\nThese solutions are for the rotational velocity about the wall normal, or\ncommon diameter of two spheres, and the translational speed along that same\ndirection, and are obtained using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes\nflows in conjunction with known solutions for the conjugate Stokes drag\nproblems, the derivations of which are demonstrated here for completeness. The\nanalogous motions in the perpendicular directions, i.e. parallel to the wall,\ncurrently cannot be calculated exactly since the relevant Stokes drag solutions\nneeded for the reciprocal theorem are not available.\n", "  We consider the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as an effective theory arising\nat the zero-dimensional boundary of a many-body localized, Fermionic symmetry\nprotected topological (SPT) phase in one spatial dimension. The Fermions at the\nboundary are always fully interacting. We find that the boundary is thermalized\nand investigate how its boundary anomaly, dictated by the bulk SPT order, is\nencoded in the quantum chaotic eigenspectrum of the SYK model. We show that\ndepending on the SPT symmetry class, the boundary many-body level statistics\ncycle in a systematic manner through those of the three different Wigner-Dyson\nrandom matrix ensembles with a periodicity in the topological index that\nmatches the interaction-reduced classification of the bulk SPT states. We\nconsider all three symmetry classes BDI, AIII, and CII, whose SPT phases are\nclassified in one spatial dimension by $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the absence of\ninteractions. For symmetry class BDI, we derive the eight-fold periodicity of\nthe Wigner-Dyson statistics by using Clifford algebras.\n", "  We discuss the mechanism of cluster formation in hierarchically collapsing\nmolecular clouds. Recent evidence, both observational and numerical, suggests\nthat molecular clouds (MCs) may be undergoing global, hierarchical\ngravitational collapse. The \"hierarchical\" regime consists of small-scale\ncollapses within larger-scale ones. The latter implies that the star formation\nrate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and occurs\nvia filamentary flows onto \"hubs\" of higher density, mass, and velocity\ndispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have\nstarted to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps\nembedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential\nwell of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early,\nsmall-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards\nthe larger potential trough, so that the filaments feed both gaseous and\nstellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal\nstructure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale\nones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits, explaining the observed\nstructural features of open clusters.\n", "  Veronese webs are closely related to bi-Hamiltonian systems, as was shown by\nGelfand and Zakharevich. Recently a correspondence between Veronese\nthree-dimensional webs and three-dimensional Einstein-Weyl structures of\nhyper-CR type was established. The latter were parametrized by Dunajski and\nKrynski via the solutions of the dispersionless Hirota equation. In this paper\nwe show relations of Veronese three-dimensional webs to several other\nintegrable equations, deform these equations preserving integrability via a\ndispersionless Lax pair and compute the corresponding contact symmetries,\nBacklund transformations and Einstein-Weyl structures. Realization of Veronese\nwebs through solutions of these deformed integrable PDE is based on a\ncorrespondence between partially integrable Nijenhuis operators to the operator\nfields with vanishing Nijenhuis tensor. This correspondence could be used to\nconstruct a link between bi-Hamiltonian finite-dimensional integrable systems\nand dispersionless integrable PDE related to the Veronese webs.\n", "  In June 2015 the Large Hadron Collider was able to produce collisions with an\nenergy of 13TeV, where collisions at these energy levels may allow for the\nformation of higher dimensional black holes. In order to detect these higher\ndimensional black holes we require an understanding of their emission spectra.\nOne way of determining this is by looking at the absorption probabilities\nassociated with the black hole. In this proceedings we will look at the\nabsorption probability for spin-3/2 particles near $N$-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black holes. We will show how the Unruh method is used to\ndetermine these probabilities for low energy particles. We then use the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation in order to determine these absorption\nprobabilities for the entire possible energy range.\n", "  We test in a simplified 5-dimensional model with SU(3) gauge symmetry, the\nevolution equations of the gauge couplings of a model containing bulk fields,\ngauge fields and one pair of fermions. In this model we assume that the fermion\ndoublet and two singlet fields are located at fixed points of the\nextra-dimension compactified on an $S^{1}/Z_{2}$ orbifold. The gauge coupling\nevolution is derived at one-loop in 5-dimensions, for the gauge group $G =\nSU(3)$, and used to test the impact on lower energy observables, in particular\nthe Weinberg angle. The gauge bosons and the Higgs field arise from the gauge\nbosons in 5 dimensions, as in a gauge-Higgs model. The model is used as a\ntesting ground as it is not a complete and realistic model for the electroweak\ninteractions.\n", "  Chromium(III) oxide is a classical collinear antiferromagnet with a linear\nmagnetoelectric effect. We are presenting the measurements of the\nmagnetoelectric susceptibility $\\alpha$ of a sputter-deposited 500-nm film and\na bulk single-crystal of Cr$_\\mathrm{2}$O$_\\mathrm{3}$. We investigated the\nmagnetic phase-transition and the critical exponent $\\beta$ of the sublattice\nmagnetization near N\\'eel temperature. For the films, an exponent of 0.49(1)\nwas found below 293 K, and changed to 1.06(4) near the N\\'eel temperature of\n298 K. For the single-crystal, the exponent was constant at 0.324(4). We\ninvestigated the reversal probability of antiferromagnetic domains during\nmagnetoelectric field cooling. For the sputtered films, reversal probability\nwas zero above 298 K and stabilized only below 293 K. We attribute this\nbehavior to formation of grains during film growth, which gives different\nintergrain and intragrain exchange-coupling energies. For the single-crystal,\nreversal probability was stabilized immediately at the N\\'eel temperature of\n307.6 K.\n", "  We study the special case of $n\\times n$ 1D Gaussian Hermitian random band\nmatrices, when the covariance of the elements is determined by\n$J=(-W^2\\triangle+1)^{-1}$. Assuming that the band width $W\\ll \\sqrt{n}$, we\nprove that the limit of the normalized second mixed moment of characteristic\npolynomials (as $W, n\\to \\infty$) is equal to one, and so it does not coincides\nwith those for GUE. This complements the previous result of T. Shcherbina and\nproves the expected crossover for 1D Hermitian random band matrices at $W\\sim\n\\sqrt{n}$ on the level of characteristic polynomials.\n", "  Thermodynamic metric usually works only for those black holes with more than\none conserved charge, therefore the Schwarzschild black hole was excluded. In\nthis letter, we compute and compare different versions of offshell\nthermodynamic metric for the Schwarzschild-like black hole by introducing a new\ndegree of freedom. This new degree of freedom could be the running Newton\nconstant, a cutoff scale for regular black hole, a noncommutative deformation,\nor the deformed parameter in the nonextensive Tsallis-Renyi entropy. The\nonshell metric of the deformed Schwarzschild solution would correspond to the\nsubmanifold by gauge fixing of this additional degree of freedom. In\nparticular, the thermal Ricci scalar for the Schwarzschild black hole, though\ndifferent for various deformation, could be obtained by switching off the\ndeformation.\n", "  The population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is composed by quiescent\nSMBHs, such as those seen in local galaxies including the Milky Way's, and\nactive ones, resulting in quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Outside our\nneighbourhood, all the information we have on SMBHs is derived from quasars and\nAGN, giving us a partial view. We study the evolution of the SMBH population,\ntotal and active, by the continuity equation, backwards in time from z=0 to\nz=4. Type-1 and type-2 AGN are differentiated in the model on the basis of the\nEddington ratio distribution, chosen on the basis of observational estimates.\nThe duty cycle is obtained by matching the luminosity function of quasars, and\nthe average radiative efficiency is the only free parameter in the model. For\nhigher radiative efficiencies (>~0.07) a large fraction of the SMBH population,\nmost of them quiescent, must already be in place by z=4. For lower radiative\nefficiencies (~0.05), the duty cycle increases with the redshift and the SMBH\npopulation evolves dramatically since z=4. The mass function of active SMBHs\ndoes not depend on the choice of the radiative efficiency or of the local SMBH\nmass function, but it is mainly determined by the quasar luminosity function,\nonce the Eddington ratio distribution is fixed. Only a direct measurement of\nthe total BHMF at redshifts z>~2 could break these degeneracies giving\nimportant constraints on the average radiative efficiency. Focusing on type-1\nAGN, for which observational estimates of the mass function and Eddington ratio\ndistribution exist at various redshift, models with lower radiative\nefficiencies reproduce better the high-mass end of the mass function at high-z,\nbut they tend to over-predict it at low-z, and vice-versa for models with\nhigher radiative efficiencies.\n", "  We analyze different families of discrete maps\\ in the N-qubit systems in the\ncontext of the permutation invariance. We prove that the tomographic condition\nimposed on the self-dual (Wigner) map is incompatible with the requirement of\nthe invariance under particle permutations, which makes it impossible to\nproject the Wootters-like Wigner function into the space of symmetric\nmeasurements. We also provide several \\textit{explicit} forms of the self-dual\nmappings: a) tomographic and b) permutation invariant \\ and analyze the\nsymmetric projection in the latter case.\n", "  The subject of matrix field theory involves matrix models, noncommutative\ngeometry, fuzzy physics and noncommutative field theory and their interplay. In\nthese lectures, a lot of emphasis is placed on the matrix formulation of\nnoncommutative and fuzzy spaces, and on the non-perturbative treatment of the\ncorresponding field theories. In particular, the phase structure of\nnoncommutative $\\phi^4$ theory is treated in great detail, and an introduction\nto noncommutative gauge theory is given.\n", "  After a quench in a quantum many-body system, expectation values tend to\nrelax towards long-time averages. However, in any finite-size system, temporal\nfluctuations remain. It is crucial to study the suppression of these\nfluctuations with system size. The particularly important case of\nnon-integrable models has been addressed so far only by numerics and\nconjectures based on analytical bounds. In this work, we are able to derive\nanalytical predictions for the temporal fluctuations in a non-integrable model\n(the transverse Ising chain with extra terms). Our results are based on\nidentifying a dynamical regime of 'many-particle dephasing', where\nquasiparticles do not yet relax but fluctuations are nonetheless suppressed\nexponentially by weak integrability breaking.\n", "  We model the superfluid flow of liquid helium over the rough surface of a\nwire (used to experimentally generate turbulence) profiled by atomic force\nmicroscopy. Numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal that\nthe sharpest features in the surface induce vortex nucleation both\nintrinsically (due to the raised local fluid velocity) and extrinsically\n(providing pinning sites to vortex lines aligned with the flow). Vortex\ninteractions and reconnections contribute to form a dense turbulent layer of\nvortices with a non-classical average velocity profile which continually sheds\nsmall vortex rings into the bulk. We characterise this layer for various\nimposed flows. As boundary layers conventionally arise from viscous forces,\nthis result opens up new insight into the nature of superflows.\n", "  In this study we consider an effective model by introducing two hypothetical\nreal scalars, $H$ and $\\chi$ - a dark matter candidate, where the masses of\nthese scalars are $2 m_h < m_H < 2 m_t$ and $m_\\chi \\approx m_h/2$ with $m_h$\nand $m_t$ being the Standard Model Higgs boson and top quark masses\nrespectively. A distortion in the transverse momentum distributions of $h$ in\nthe intermediate region of the spectrum through the processes $p p \\to H \\to\nh\\chi\\chi$ could be observed in this model. An additional scalar, $S$, has been\npostulated to explain large $H \\to h\\chi\\chi$ branching ratios, assuming $m_h\n\\lesssim m_S \\lesssim m_H-m_h$ and $m_S > 2 m_\\chi$. Furthermore, a scenario of\na two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is introduced and a detailed proposal at the\npresent energies of the Large Hadron Collider to study the extra CP-even ($h,\nH$), CP-odd ($A$) and charged ($H^\\pm$) scalars has been pursued. With possible\nphenomenological implications, all possible spectra and decay modes for these\nscalars are discussed. Based on the mass spectrum of $H, A$ and $H^\\pm$, the\nproduction of multi-leptons and $Z$+jets+missing-energy events are predicted. A\nspecific, Type-II 2HDM model is discussed in detail.\n", "  The discovery and subsequent study of optical counterparts to transient\nsources is crucial for their complete astrophysical understanding. Various\ngamma ray burst (GRB) detectors, and more notably the ground--based\ngravitational wave detectors, typically have large uncertainties in the sky\npositions of detected sources. Searching these large sky regions spanning\nhundreds of square degrees is a formidable challenge for most ground--based\noptical telescopes, which can usually image less than tens of square degrees of\nthe sky in a single night. We present algorithms for optimal scheduling of such\nfollow--up observations in order to maximize the probability of imaging the\noptical counterpart, based on the all--sky probability distribution of the\nsource position. We incorporate realistic observing constraints like the\ndiurnal cycle, telescope pointing limitations, available observing time, and\nthe rising/setting of the target at the observatory location. We use\nsimulations to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the default\ngreedy observing schedule used by many observatories. Our algorithms are\napplicable for follow--up of other transient sources with large positional\nuncertainties, like Fermi--detected GRBs, and can easily be adapted for\nscheduling radio or space--based X--ray followup.\n", "  High flux of hyperentangled photons entails collecting the two-photon\nemission over relatively wide extent in frequency and transverse space within\nwhich the photon pairs are simultaneously entangled in multiple degrees of\nfreedom. In this paper, we present a numerical approach to determining the\nspatial-spectral relative-phase and time-delay maps of hyperentangled photons\nall over the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) emission cone. We\nconsider the hyperentangled-photons produced by superimposing noncollinear SPDC\nemissions of two crossed and coherently-pumped nonlinear crystals. We adopt a\nvectorial representation for all parameters of concern. This enables us to\nstudy special settings such as the self-compensation via oblique pump\nincidence. While rigorous quantum treatment of SPDC emission requires Gaussian\nstate representation, in low-gain regime (like the case of the study), it is\nwell approximated to the first order to superposition of vacuum and two-photon\nstates. The relative phase and time-delay maps are then calculated between the\ntwo-photon wavepackets created along symmetrical locations of the crystals.\nAssuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations\nlike energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one\nof the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of\nlongitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon\nemission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the\nperfect phase-matching direction. While prior works often adopt first-order\napproximation, it is shown that the relative-phase map is a very well\napproximated to a quadratic function in the polar angle of the two-photon\nemission while negligibly varying with the azimuthal angle.\n", "  A study of elliptic flow of open charm mesons, $D^0$ and $D_S ^\\pm$ using\nquark coalescence as a mechanism of hadronization of heavy quarks implemented\nin conjunction with A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model has been presented. We\nhave studied the transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow parameter\nat mid-rapidity ($|y|$ $<$ 1.0) for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$\nGeV (RHIC) and Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV (LHC) for\ndifferent values of partonic interaction cross-section and QCD coupling\nconstant. We have compared our calculations with the experimentally measured\ndata at the LHC energy. We have also studied the effect of shear viscosity on\nelliptic flow of open charm mesons within the transport model approach. Our\nstudy indicates that the elliptic flow of open charmed mesons is more sensitive\nto viscous properties of QGP medium as compared to light charged hadrons.\n", "  The Raman spectrum of plutonium dioxide is studied both experimentally and\ntheoretically. Particular attention has been devoted to the identification of\nhigh-energy modes at $2120$ cm$^{-1}$ and $2625$ cm$^{-1}$, the attribution of\nwhich has so far been controversial. The temperature dependence of both modes\nsuggests an electronic origin. Crystal Field (CF) calculations reported in this\nwork shows that these two modes can be respectively assigned to the\n${\\Gamma}_{1}$ $\\rightarrow$ ${\\Gamma}_{5}$ and ${\\Gamma}_{1}$ $\\rightarrow $\n${\\Gamma}_{3}$ CF transitions within the $^{5}I_{4}$ manifold. These two modes,\ntogether with the only vibrational line foreseen by the group theory for the\nFm${-3}$m PuO$_{2}$ symmetry the T$_{2g}$ PuO stretching mode observed at $478$\ncm$^{-1}$ can thus be used as Raman fingerprint of fcc plutonium dioxide.\n", "  A classical identity due to Giambelli in representation theory states that\nthe character in any representation is expressed as a determinant whose\ncomponents are characters in the hook representation constructed from all the\ncombinations of the arm and leg lengths of the original representation.\nPreviously it was shown that the identity persists in taking, for each\ncharacter, the matrix integration in the super Chern-Simons matrix model in the\ngrand canonical ensemble. We prove here that this Giambelli compatibility still\nholds in the deformation of the fractional-brane background.\n", "  The demand for nonlinear effects within a silicon platform to support\nphotonic circuits requiring phase-only modulation, frequency doubling, and/or\ndifference frequency generation, is becoming increasingly clear. However, the\nsymmetry of the silicon crystal inhibits second order optical nonlinear\nsusceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$. Here, we show that the crystalline symmetry is\nbroken when a DC field is present, inducing a $\\chi^{(2)}$ in a silicon\nwaveguide that is proportional to the large $\\chi^{(3)}$ of silicon. First,\nMach-Zehnder interferometers using the DC Kerr effect optical phase shifters in\nsilicon ridge waveguides with p-i-n junctions are demonstrated with a\n$V_{\\pi}L$ of $2.4Vcm$ in telecom bands $({\\lambda}_{\\omega}=1.58{\\mu}m)$\nwithout requiring to dope the silicon core. Second, the pump and second\nharmonic modes in silicon ridge waveguides are quasi-phase matched when the\nmagnitude, spatial distribution of the DC field and $\\chi^{(2)}$ are controlled\nwith p-i-n junctions. Using these waveguides, second harmonic generation at\nmultiple pump wavelengths are observed with a maximum efficiency of\n$P_{2{\\omega}}/P_{\\omega}^2$=12%/W at ${\\lambda}_{\\omega}=2.29{\\mu}m$ in a 1mm\nlong waveguide. This corresponds to a field-induced $\\chi^{(2)}=41pm/V$,\ncomparable to non-centrosymmetric media (LiNbO3, GaAs, GaN). The field-induced\nnonlinear silicon photonics will lead to a new class of CMOS compatible\nintegrated devices spanning from near to mid infrared spectrum.\n", "  Interacting resonators can lead to strong non-linearities but the details can\nbe complicated to predict. In this work, we study the non-linearities\nintroduced by two nested microcavities that interact with nitrogen vacancy\ncenters in a diamond waveguide. Each cavity has differently designed resonance;\none in the green and one in the infrared. The magnetic-field dependence of the\nnitrogen vacancy center absorption rates on the green and the recently observed\ninfrared transitions allows us to propose a scalable on-chip magnetometer that\ncombines high magnetic-field sensitivity and micrometer spatial resolution. By\ninvestigating the system behaviors over several intrinsic and extrinsic\nparameters, we explain the main non-linearities induced by the NV centers and\nenhanced by the cavities. We finally show that the cavities can improve the\nmagnetic-field sensitivity by up to two orders of magnitudes.\n", "  NOON states play the important roles in quantum information processings and\nquantum metrology, but the fidelities of these states generated previously are\nlimited typically by the practically-unavoidable decoherence and operational\nimperfections. Here, we propose an efficient scheme to generate photonic NOON\nstates alternatively by rapid population passage technique via shortcut to\nadiabaticity (STA), rather than the usual Rabi oscillations. Since the\ndeterministic population passages based on the STAs are insensitive to details\nof the operations and can be implemented as fast as the Rabi oscillations, the\nfidelity of the generated NOON state could be satisfactorily high. The\nfeasibility of the proposal is demonstrated specifically with the experimental\ncircuit QED systems by rapidly driving two artifical qutrits.\n", "  We have measured weak antilocalization effects, universal conductance\nfluctuations, and Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the two-dimensional electron\ngas formed in InGaAs/AlInAs heterostructures. This system possesses strong\nspin-orbit coupling and a high Land\\'{e} factor. Phase-coherence lengths of\n2$-$4 $\\mu$m at 1.5$-$4.2 K are extracted from the magnetoconductance\nmeasurements. The analysis of the coherence-sensitive data reveals that the\ntemperature dependence of the decoherence rate complies with the dephasing\nmechanism originating from electron-electron interactions in all three\nexperiments. Distinct beating patterns superimposed on the Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations are observed over a wide range of magnetic fields, up to 0.7 Tesla\nat the relatively high temperature of 1.5 K. The possibility that these beats\nare due to the interplay between the Aharonov-Bohm phase and the Berry one,\ndifferent for electrons of opposite spins in the presence of strong spin-orbit\nand Zeeman interactions in ring geometries, is carefully investigated. It\nappears that our data are not explained by this mechanism; rather, a few\ngeometrically-different electronic paths within the ring's width can account\nfor the oscillations' modulations.\n", "  We make an attempt to identify regions in a Type II Two-Higgs Doublet Model,\nwhich correspond to a metastable electroweak vacuum with lifetime larger than\nthe age of the universe. We analyse scenarios which retain perturbative\nunitarity up to Grand unification and Planck scales. Each point in the\nparameter space is restricted using Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nas well as flavor and precision electroweak constraints. We find that\nsubstantial regions of the parameter space are thus identified as corresponding\nto metastability, which compliment the allowed regions for absolute stability,\nfor top quark mass at the high as well as low end of its currently allowed\nrange. Thus, a two-Higgs doublet scenario with the electroweak vacuum, either\nstable or metastable, can sail through all the way up to the Planck scale\nwithout facing any contradictions.\n", "  We present a new technique for transferring momentum and velocity between\nparticles and grid with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) calculations which we call\nAffine-Particle-In-Cell (APIC). APIC represents particle velocities as locally\naffine, rather than locally constant as in traditional PIC. We show that this\nrepresentation allows APIC to conserve linear and angular momentum across\ntransfers while also dramatically reducing numerical diffusion usually\nassociated with PIC. Notably, conservation is achieved with lumped mass, as\nopposed to the more commonly used Fluid Implicit Particle (FLIP) transfers\nwhich require a 'full' mass matrix for exact conservation. Furthermore, unlike\nFLIP, APIC retains a filtering property of the original PIC and thus does not\naccumulate velocity modes on particles as FLIP does. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that APIC does not experience velocity instabilities that are\ncharacteristic of FLIP in a number of Material Point Method (MPM)\nhyperelasticity calculations. Lastly, we demonstrate that when combined with\nthe midpoint rule for implicit update of grid momentum that linear and angular\nmomentum are exactly conserved.\n", "  We show that the spectral split of a neutrino ensemble which initially\nconsists of electron type neutrinos, is analogous to the BCS-BEC crossover\nalready observed in ultra cold atomic gas experiments. Such a neutrino ensemble\nmimics the deleptonization burst of a core collapse supernova. Although these\ntwo phenomena belong to very different domains of physics, the propagation of\nneutrinos from highly interacting inner regions of the supernova to the vacuum\nis reminiscent of the evolution of Cooper pairs between weak and strong\ninteraction regimes during the crossover. The Hamiltonians and the\ncorresponding many-body states undergo very similar transformations if one\nreplaces the pair quasispin of the latter with the neutrino isospin of the\nformer.\n", "  We present a pedagogical review of our current understanding of the\nultraviolet structure of N = (1,1) 6D supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and of N\n= 8 4D supergravity. These theories are not renormalizable, they involve power\nultraviolet divergences and, in all probability, an infinite set of\nhigher-dimensional counterterms that contribute to on-mass-shell scattering\namplitudes.\n  A specific feature of supersymmetric theories (especially, of extended\nsupersymmetric theories) is that these counterterms may not be invariant off\nshell under the full set of supersymmetry transformations. The\nlowest-dimensional nontrivial counterterm is supersymmetric on shell. Still\nhigher counterterms may lose even the on-shell invariance. On the other hand,\nthe full effective Lagrangian, generating the amplitudes and representing an\ninfinite sum of counterterms, still enjoys the complete symmetry of original\ntheory.\n  We also discuss simple supersymmetric quantum-mechanical models that exhibit\nthe same behaviour.\n", "  We perform a measurement of the mass--richness relation of the redMaPPer\ngalaxy cluster catalogue using weak lensing data from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. We have carefully characterized a broad range of systematic\nuncertainties, including shear calibration errors, photo-$z$ biases, dilution\nby member galaxies, source obscuration, magnification bias, incorrect\nassumptions about cluster mass profiles, cluster centering, halo triaxiality,\nand projection effects. We also compare measurements of the lensing signal from\ntwo independently-produced shear and photometric redshift catalogues to\ncharacterize systematic errors in the lensing signal itself. Using a sample of\n5,570 clusters from $0.1\\le z\\le 0.33$, the normalization of our power-law mass\nvs.\\ $\\lambda$ relation is $\\log_{10}[M_{200m}/h^{-1}\\ M_{\\odot}]$ = $14.344\n\\pm 0.021$ (statistical) $\\pm 0.023$ (systematic) at a richness $\\lambda=40$, a\n7 per cent calibration uncertainty, with a power-law index of\n$1.33^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ ($1\\sigma$). The detailed systematics characterization\nin this work renders it the definitive weak lensing mass calibration for SDSS\nredMaPPer clusters at this time.\n", "  The purpose of the present paper is to provide an overview of\nAsymptotic-Preserving methods for multiscale plasma simulations by addressing\nthree singular perturbation problems. First, the quasi-neutral limit of fluid\nand kinetic models is investigated in the framework of non magnetized as well\nas magnetized plasmas. Second, the drift limit for fluid descriptions of\nthermal plasmas under large magnetic fields is addressed. Finally efficient\nnumerical resolutions of anisotropic elliptic or diffusion equations arising in\nmagnetized plasma simulation are reviewed.\n", "  Various forms of spin and charge ordering have been identified in a wide\nrange of cuprate superconducting materials, but whether these behaviors are\nubiquitous phenomena is not established. In this work we focus on one of the\nsimplest compounds, HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ (Hg1201), a superconductor with\na high transition temperature, 97 K, having only a single layer and tetragonal\nstructure, in contrast to one of the most extensively studied materials,\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+y}$ (Y123). Using nuclear magnetic resonance we have\ndiscovered a coherent spatial modulation of both spin and charge that is\ntemperature and magnetic field independent, in competition with\nsuperconductivity similar to other cuprates. However, there is no evidence for\nthe magnetic field and temperature induced charge order observed in Y123.\nElectronic instabilities are a common feature of cuprates as in the present\nwork on Hg1201, but their manifestations are not universal.\n", "  In 1954, Dicke predicted that a system of quantum emitters confined to a\nsubwavelength volume would produce a superradiant burst. For such a burst to\noccur, the emitters must be in the special Dicke state with zero dipole moment.\nWe show that a superradiant burst may also arise for non-Dicke initial states\nwith nonzero dipole moment. Both for Dicke and non-Dicke initial states,\nsuperradiance arises due to a decrease in the dispersion of the quantum phase\nof the emitter state. For non-Dicke states, the quantum phase is related to the\nphase of long-period envelopes which modulate the oscillations of the dipole\nmoments. A decrease in dispersion of the quantum phase causes a decrease in the\ndispersion of envelope phases that results in constructive interference of the\nenvelopes and the superradiant burst.\n", "  The dynamics of a mobile quantum impurity in a degenerate Fermi system is a\nfundamental problem in many-body physics. The interest in this field has been\nrenewed due to recent ground-breaking experiments with ultra-cold Fermi gases.\nOptical creation of an exciton or a polariton in a two-dimensional electron\nsystem embedded in a microcavity constitutes a new frontier for this field due\nto an interplay between cavity-coupling favoring ultra-low mass polariton\nformation and exciton-electron interactions leading to polaron or trion\nformation. Here, we present cavity spectroscopy of gate-tunable monolayer\nMoSe$_2$ exhibiting strongly bound trion and polaron resonances, as well as\nnon-perturbative coupling to a single microcavity mode. As the electron density\nis increased, the oscillator strength determined from the polariton splitting\nis gradually transferred from the higher-energy repulsive-exciton-polaron\nresonance to the lower-energy attractive-polaron manifold. Simultaneous\nobservation of polariton formation in both attractive and repulsive branches\nindicate a new regime of polaron physics where the polariton impurity mass is\nmuch smaller than that of the electrons. Our findings shed new light on optical\nresponse of semiconductors in the presence of free carriers by identifying the\nFermi polaron nature of excitonic resonances and constitute a first step in\ninvestigation of a new class of degenerate Bose-Fermi mixtures.\n", "  We present a computational study of the magnetic anisotropy energy for a\ngiven concentration of the Mn ions in the GaAs host, in the framework of the\ndensity functional theory. We focus on the influence of a different kind of\nstrains on the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constants $K_1$ and $K_2$, which\nreflect the magnetic anisotropy energy out- and in- (001) plane, respectively.\nWe have shown that the general trends for the applied biaxial strain on\nanisotropy constants are consistent with the experimental data. We have\npredicted the critical strains, for which the magnetization vector changes its\ndirection. Our results have shown that it is not possible to modify\nconsiderably the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy constants, exposing (Ga,Mn)As to\nhydrostatic pressure of a magnitude reasonable from experimental point of view.\n", "  We study the Lagrangian dynamics of passive tracers in a simple model of a\ndriven two-dimensional vortex resembling real-world geophysical flow patterns.\nUsing a discrete approximation of the system's transfer operator, we construct\na directed network that characterizes the exchange of mass between distinct\nregions of the flow domain. By studying different measures characterizing flow\nnetwork connectivity at different time-scales, we are able to identify the\nlocation of dynamically invariant structures and regions of maximum dispersion.\nSpecifically, our approach allows to delimit co-existing flow regimes with\ndifferent dynamics. To validate our findings, we compare several network\ncharacteristics to the well-established finite-time Lyapunov exponents and\napply a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify network\nmeasures that are particularly useful for unveiling the skeleton of Lagrangian\nchaos.\n", "  Using simple kinematics, we propose a general theory of linear wave\ninteractions between the interfacial waves of a two dimensional (2D), inviscid,\nmulti-layered fluid system. The strength of our formalism is that one does not\nhave to specify the physics of the waves in advance. Wave interactions may lead\nto instabilities, which may or may not be of the familiar \"normal-mode\" type.\nContrary to intuition, the underlying dynamical system describing linear wave\ninteractions is found to be non-linear. Specifically, a saw-tooth jet profile\nwith three interfaces possessing kinematic and geometric symmetry is explored.\nFixed points of the system for different ranges of a Froude number like control\nparameter $\\gamma$ are derived, and their stability evaluated. Depending upon\nthe initial condition and $\\gamma$, the dynamical system may reveal transient\ngrowth, weakly positive Lyapunov exponents, as well as different non-linear\nphenomena such as formation of periodic and pseudo-periodic orbits. All these\noccur for those ranges of $\\gamma$ where normal-mode theory predicts neutral\nstability. Such rich non-linear phenomena is not observed in 2D dynamical\nsystem resulting from the $2$-wave problem, which only reveals stable and\nunstable nodes.\n", "  Phenomenological Lagrangians for physical systems with spontaneously broken\nsymmetries are reformulated in terms of gauge field theory. Description of the\nDirac $p$-branes in terms of the Yang-Mills-Cartan gauge multiplets interacting\nwith gravity, is proved to be equivalent to their description as a closed\ndynamical system with the symmetry $ISO(1,D-1)$ spontaneously broken to\n$ISO(1,p)\\times SO(D-p-1)$.\n", "  We establish through numerical simulation conditions for optimal undulatory\npropulsion for a single fish, and for a pair of hydrodynamically interacting\nfish, accounting for linear and angular recoil. We first employ systematic 2D\nsimulations to identify conditions for minimal propulsive power of a\nself-propelled fish, and continue with targeted 3D simulations for a danio-like\nfish. We find that the Strouhal number, phase angle between heave and pitch at\nthe trailing edge, and angle of attack are principal parameters. Angular recoil\nhas significant impact on efficiency, while optimized body bending requires\nmaximum bending amplitude upstream of the trailing edge. For 2D simulations,\nimposing a deformation based on measured displacement for carangiform swimming\nprovides efficiency of 40%, which increases for an optimized profile to 57%;\nfor a 3D fish, the corresponding increase is from 22% to 35%; all at Reynolds\nnumber 5000.\n  Next, we turn to 2D simulation of two hydrodynamically interacting fish. We\nfind that the upstream fish benefits energetically only for small distances. In\ncontrast, the downstream fish can benefit at any position that allows\ninteraction with the upstream wake, provided its body motion is timed\nappropriately with respect to the oncoming vortices. For an in-line\nconfiguration, one body length apart, the optimal efficiency of the downstream\nfish can increase to 66%; for an offset arrangement it can reach 81%. This\nproves that in groups of fish, energy savings can be achieved for downstream\nfish through interaction with oncoming vortices, even when the downstream fish\nlies directly inside the jet-like flow of an upstream fish.\n", "  Despite all fundamental objections against Newtonian concepts in cosmology,\nthe Friedmann equation derives from these in an astoundingly simple way through\napplication of the shell theorem and conservation of Newtonian energy in an\ninfinite universe. However, Friedmann universes in general posses a finite\ngravitational horizon, as a result of which the application of the shell\ntheorem fails and the Newtonian derivation collapses. We show that in the\npresence of a gravitational horizon the Friedmann equation can be derived from\na Machian definition of kinetic energy, without invoking the shell theorem.\nWhereas in the Newtonian case total energy translates to curvature energy\ndensity, in the Machian case total energy takes on different identities,\ndepending on the evolution of the horizon; we show that in the de Sitter\nuniverse Machian total energy density is constant, i.e. appears as cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  The study of networks plays a crucial role in investigating the structure,\ndynamics, and function of a wide variety of complex systems in myriad\ndisciplines. Despite the success of traditional network analysis, standard\nnetworks provide a limited representation of complex systems, which often\ninclude different types of relationships (i.e., \"multiplexity\") among their\nconstituent components and/or multiple interacting subsystems. Such structural\ncomplexity has a significant effect on both dynamics and function. Throwing\naway or aggregating available structural information can generate misleading\nresults and be a major obstacle towards attempts to understand complex systems.\n  The recent \"multilayer\" approach for modeling networked systems explicitly\nallows the incorporation of multiplexity and other features of realistic\nsystems. On one hand, it allows one to couple different structural\nrelationships by encoding them in a convenient mathematical object. On the\nother hand, it also allows one to couple different dynamical processes on top\nof such interconnected structures. The resulting framework plays a crucial role\nin helping achieve a thorough, accurate understanding of complex systems. The\nstudy of multilayer networks has also revealed new physical phenomena that\nremain hidden when using ordinary graphs, the traditional network\nrepresentation. Here we survey progress towards attaining a deeper\nunderstanding of spreading processes on multilayer networks, and we highlight\nsome of the physical phenomena related to spreading processes that emerge from\nmultilayer structure.\n", "  Under the principle that quantum mechanical observables are invariant under\nrelevant symmetry transformations, we explore how the usual, non-invariant\nquantities may capture measurement statistics. Using a relativisation mapping,\nviewed as the incorporation of a quantum reference frame, we show that the\nusual quantum description approximates the relative one precisely when the\nreference system admits an appropriate localisable quantity and a localised\nstate. From this follows a new perspective on the nature and reality of quantum\nsuperpositions and optical coherence.\n", "  We present a review of our recent study (A. Reshetnyak, IJMPA 29 (2014)\n1450128; P. Moshin, A. Reshetnyak, Nucl. Phys. B 888 (2014) 92; Phys. Lett B\n739 (2014) 110; IJMPA 29 (2014) 1450159; IJMPA 30 (2015) 1550021; IJMPA 31\n(2016) 1650111), in which the concept of finite field-dependent BRST and\nBRST-antiBRST transformations for gauge theories was introduced, and their\nproperties investigated. An algorithm of exact calculation for the Jacobian of\na respective change of variables in the path integral is presented.\nApplications to the Yang--Mills theory and Standard Model, in view of infra-red\n(Gribov) peculiarities, are discussed.\n", "  Spatial networks have recently attracted great interest in various fields of\nresearch. While the traditional network-theoretic viewpoint is commonly\nrestricted to their topological characteristics (often disregarding existing\nspatial constraints), this work takes a geometric perspective, which considers\nvertices and edges as objects in a metric space and quantifies the\ncorresponding spatial distribution and alignment. For this purpose, we\nintroduce the concept of edge anisotropy and define a class of measures\ncharacterizing the spatial directedness of connections. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that the local anisotropy of edges incident to a given vertex\nprovides useful information about the local geometry of geophysical flows based\non networks constructed from spatio-temporal data, which is complementary to\ntopological characteristics of the same flow networks. Taken both structural\nand geometric viewpoints together can thus assist the identification of\nunderlying flow structures from observations of scalar variables.\n", "  In this paper we study the weak decays of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon(1S)$. Using\nthe Bethe-Salpeter method, we calculate the hadronic transition amplitude and\ngive the form factors. We find that two new form factors $h_1$ and $h_2$, which\ndo not appear in existing literature, have contributions in $1^-\\to 1^-$\ndecays. They affect the branching ratios of semi-leptonic and non-leptonic\ndecays by the rate of $3\\%\\sim6\\%$ and $2\\%\\sim14\\%$, respectively, so their\ncontributions can not be ignored and should be considered. Our results show\nthat, for the semi-leptonic decay modes, the largest branching ratios are of\nthe order of $10^{-10}$ both for $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon(1S)$ decays, and the\nlargest branching ratios of non-leptonic decays are of the order of $10^{-9}$\nfor $J/\\psi$ and $10^{-10}$ for $\\Upsilon(1S)$.\n", "  The paper is devoted to operators given formally by the expression\n\\begin{equation*} -\\partial_x^2+\\big(\\alpha-\\frac14\\big)x^{-2}. \\end{equation*}\nThis expression is homogeneous of degree minus 2. However, when we try to\nrealize it as a self-adjoint operator for real $\\alpha$, or closed operator for\ncomplex $\\alpha$, we find that this homogeneity can be broken.\n  This leads to a definition of two holomorphic families of closed operators on\n$L^2({\\mathbb R}_+)$, which we denote $H_{m,\\kappa}$ and $H_0^\\nu$, with\n$m^2=\\alpha$, $-1<\\Re(m)<1$, and where $\\kappa,\\nu\\in{\\mathbb C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\}$\nspecify the boundary condition at $0$. We study these operators using their\nexplicit solvability in terms of Bessel-type functions and the Gamma function.\nIn particular, we show that their point spectrum has a curious shape: a string\nof eigenvalues on a piece of a spiral. Their continuous spectrum is always\n$[0,\\infty[$. Restricted to their continuous spectrum, we diagonalize these\noperators using a generalization of the Hankel transformation. We also study\ntheir scattering theory.\n  These operators are usually non-self-adjoint. Nevertheless, it is possible to\nuse concepts typical for the self-adjoint case to study them. Let us also\nstress that $-1<\\Re(m)<1$ is the maximal region of parameters for which the\noperators $H_{m,\\kappa}$ can be defined within the framework of the Hilbert\nspace $L^2({\\mathbb R}_+)$.\n", "  The $\\nu=\\frac{5}{2}$ fractional quantum Hall effect is of experimental and\ntheoretical interest due to the possible non-Abelian statistics of the\nexcitations in the electron liquid. A small voltage difference across a sample\napplied in experiments to probe the system is often ignored in theoretical\nstudies due to the Galilean invariance in the thermodynamic limit. No\nexperimental sample, however, is Galilean invariant. In this work, we explore\nthe effects of the probe electric fields in a disk geometry with finite\nthickness. We find that weak probe fields enhance the Moore-Read Pfaffian state\nbut sufficiently strong electric fields destroy the incompressible state. In a\ndisk geometry, the behavior of the system depends on the polarity of the\napplied radial field, which can potentially be observed in experiments using in\na Corbino disk configuration. Our simulation also shows that the application of\nsuch a field enhances the coherence length of quasiholes propagating through\nthe edge channels\n", "  We point out that recently published analyses of null and timelike infinity\nand long-range structures in electrodynamics to large extent rediscover results\npresent in literature. At the same time, some of the conclusions these recent\nworks put forward may prove controversial. In view of these facts we find it\ndesirable to revisit the analysis taken up more than two decades ago, starting\nfrom earlier works on null infinity by other authors.\n", "  We explore the discovery potential of Higgs pair production at a 100 TeV\ncollider via full leptonic mode. The same mode can be explored at the LHC when\nHiggs pair production is enhanced by new physics. We examine two types of fully\nleptonic final states and propose a partial reconstruction method. The\nreconstruction method can reconstruct some kinematic observables. It is found\nthat the $m_{T2}$ variable determined by this reconstruction method and the\nreconstructed visible Higgs mass are important and crucial to discriminate the\nsignal and background events. It is also noticed that a new variable, denoted\nas $\\Delta m$ which is defined as the mass difference of two possible\ncombinations, is very useful as a discriminant. We also investigate the\ninterplay between the direct measurements of $t\\bar{t} h$ couplings and other\nrelated couplings and trilinear Higgs coupling at hadron colliders and\nelectron-positron colliders.\n", "  We propose a scheme to measure the parity of two distant qubits, while\nensuring that losses on the quantum channel between them does not destroy\ncoherences within the parity subspaces. This capability enables deterministic\npreparation of highly entangled qubit states whose fidelity is not limited by\nthe transmission loss. The key observation is that for a probe electromagnetic\nfield in a particular quantum state, namely a superposition of two coherent\nstates of opposite phases, the transmission loss stochastically applies a\nnear-unitary back-action on the probe state. This leads to a parity measurement\nprotocol where the main effect of the transmission losses is a decrease in the\nmeasurement strength. By repeating the non-destructive (weak) parity\nmeasurement, one achieves a high-fidelity entanglement in spite of a\nsignificant transmission loss.\n", "  The scalability of quantum dot based non-classical light sources relies on\nthe control over their dissimilar emission energies. Electric fields offer a\npromising route to tune the quantum dot emission energy through the\nquantum-confined Stark effect. However, electric fields have been mostly used\nfor tuning the energy of single-photon emission from quantum dots, while\nelectrical control over the energy of entangled-photon emission, which is\ncrucial for building a solid-state quantum repeater using indistinguishable\nentangled photons, has not been realized yet. Here, we present a method to\nachieve electrical control over the energy of entangled-photon emission from\nquantum dots. The device consists of an electrically-tunable quantum diode\nintegrated onto a piezoactuator. We find that, through application of a\nvertical electric field, the critical uniaxial stress used to eliminate the\nfine-structure-splitting of quantum dots can be linearly tuned. This allows\nrealization of a triggered source of energy-tunable entangled-photon emission,\nan important step towards a solid-state quantum repeater application.\n", "  In this work, the use of the Boltzmann collision operator for dissipative\nquantum transport is analyzed. Its mathematical role on the description of the\ntime-evolution of the density matrix during a collision can be understood as\nprocesses of adding and subtracting states. We show that unphysical results can\nbe present in quantum simulations when the old states (that built the density\nmatrix associated to an open system before the collision) are different from\nthe additional states generated by the Boltzmann collision operator. As a\nconsequence of the Fermi Golden rule, the new generated sates are usually\neigenstates of the momentum or kinetic energy. Then, the different\ntime-evolutions of old and new states involved in a collision process can\noriginate negative values of the charge density, even longer after the\ncollision. This unphysical feature disappears when the Boltzmann collision\noperator generates states that were already present in the density matrix of\nthe quantum system before the collision. Following these ideas, in this paper,\nwe introduce an algorithm that models phonon-electron interactions through the\nBoltzmann collision operator without negative values of the charge density. The\nmodel only requires the exact knowledge, at all times, of the states that build\nthe density matrix of the open system.\n", "  We use ab intio density functional theory to investigate the adsorption\nproperties of acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin on a (10, 0) carbon nanotube\n(CNT) and a (8, 0) triazine-based graphitic carbon nitride nanotube (CNNT). It\nis found that an aspirin molecule binds stronger to the CNNT with its\nadsorption energy of 0.67 eV than to the CNT with 0.51 eV. The stronger\nadsorption energy on the CNNT is ascribed to the high reactivity of its N atoms\nwith high electron affinity. The CNNT exhibits local electric dipole moments,\nwhich cause strong charge redistribution in the aspirin molecule adsorbed on\nthe CNNT than on the CNT. We also explore the influence of an external electric\nfield on the adsorption properties of aspirin on these nanotubes by examining\nthe modifications in their electronic band structures, partial densities of\nstates, and charge distributions. It is found that an electric field applied\nalong a particular direction induces aspirin molecular states in the in-gap\nregion of the CNNT implying a potential application of aspirin detection.\n", "  Ammonia and its deuterated isotopologues probe physical conditions in dense\nmolecular cloud cores. With the aim of testing the current understanding of the\nspin-state chemistry of these molecules, we observed spectral lines of NH3,\nNH2D, NHD2, ND3, and N2D+ towards a dense, starless core in Ophiuchus with the\nAPEX, GBT, and IRAM 30-m telescopes. The observations were interpreted using a\ngas-grain chemistry model combined with radiative transfer calculations. The\nchemistry model distinguishes between the different nuclear spin states of\nlight hydrogen molecules, ammonia, and their deuterated forms. High deuterium\nfractionation ratios with NH2D/NH3=0.4, NHD2/NH2D=0.2, and ND3/NHD2=0.06 were\nfound in the core. The observed ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are close to\nthe corresponding nuclear spin statistical weights. The chemistry model can\napproximately reproduce the observed abundances, but predicts uniformly too low\northo/para-NH2D, and too large ortho/para-NHD2 ratios. The longevity of N2H+\nand NH3 in dense gas, which is prerequisite to their strong deuteration, can be\nattributed to the chemical inertia of N2 on grain surfaces. The discrepancies\nbetween the chemistry model and the observations are likely to be caused by the\nfact that the model assumes complete scrambling in principal gas-phase\ndeuteration reactions of ammonia, which means that all the nuclei are mixed in\nreactive collisions. If, instead, these reactions occur through proton\nhop/hydrogen abstraction processes, statistical spin ratios are to be expected.\nThe present results suggest that while the deuteration of ammonia changes with\nphysical conditions and time, the nuclear spin ratios of ammonia isotopologues\ndo not probe the evolutionary stage of a cloud.\n", "  We study current-driven skyrmion motion in uniaxial thin film\nantiferromagnets in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and\nin an external magnetic field. We phenomenologically include relaxation and\ncurrent-induced torques due to both spin-orbit coupling and spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetic textures in the equation for the N\\'eel vector of the\nantiferromagnet. Using the collective coordinate approach we apply the theory\nto a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic skyrmion and estimate the skyrmion\nvelocity under an applied DC electric current.\n", "  We improve the Lieb-Robinson bound for a wide class of quantum many-body\nsystems with long-range interactions decaying by power law. As an application,\nwe show that the group velocity of information propagation grows by power law\nin time for such systems, whereas systems with short-range interactions exhibit\na finite group velocity as shown by Lieb and Robinson.\n", "  We describe a project-based computational physics course developed using a\nbackwards course design approach. From an initial competency-based model of\nproblem solving in computational physics, we interviewed faculty who use these\ntools in their own research to determine indicators of expert practice. From\nthese, a rubric was formulated that enabled us to design a course intended to\nallow students to learn these skills. We also report an initial implementation\nof the course and, by having the interviewees regrade student work, show that\nstudents acquired many of the expert practices identified.\n", "  We give an alternative perturbative proof of the renormalizability of the\nsystem defined by the gradient flow and the fermion flow in vector-like gauge\ntheories.\n", "  We consider the spherical reduction of the rational Calogero model (of type\n$A_{n-1}$, without the center of mass) as a maximally superintegrable quantum\nsystem. It describes a particle on the $(n{-}2)$-sphere in a very special\npotential. A detailed analysis is provided of the simplest non-separable case,\n$n{=}4$, whose potential blows up at the edges of a spherical tetrahexahedron,\ntesselating the two-sphere into 24 identical right isosceles spherical\ntriangles in which the particle is trapped. We construct a complete set of\nindependent conserved charges and of Hamiltonian intertwiners and elucidate\ntheir algebra. The key structure is the ring of polynomials in Dunkl-deformed\nangular momenta, in particular the subspaces invariant and antiinvariant under\nall Weyl reflections, respectively.\n", "  The new results concerning neutron emission detection from a laboratory\nhigh-voltage discharge in the air are presented. Data were obtained with a\ncombination of plastic scintillation detectors and $^3$He filled counters of\nthermal neutrons. Strong dependence of the hard x-ray and neutron radiation\nappearance on the field strength near electrodes, which is determined by their\nform, was found. We have revealed a more sophisticated temporal structure of\nthe neutron bursts observed during of electric discharge. This may indicate\ndifferent mechanisms for generating penetrating radiation at the time formation\nand development of the atmospheric discharge.\n", "  We investigate first-order approximations to both i) Tsallis' entropy $S_q$\nand ii) the $S_q$-MaxEnt solution (called q-exponential functions $e_q$). It is\nshown that the functions arising from the procedure ii) are the MaxEnt\nsolutions to the entropy emerging from i). The present treatment is free of the\npoles that, for classic quadratic Hamiltonians, appear in Tsallis' approach, as\ndemonstrated in [Europhysics Letters {\\bf 104}, (2013), 60003]. Additionally,\nwe show that our treatment is compatible with extant date on the ozone layer.\n", "  Understanding the collective dynamics in a many-body system has been a\ncentral task in condensed matter physics. To achieve this task, we develop a\nHartree-Fock theory to study the collective oscillations of spinor Fermi\nsystem, motivated by recent experiment on spin-9/2 fermions. We observe an\noscillation period shoulder for small rotation angles. Different from previous\nstudies, where the shoulder is found connected to the resonance from periodic\nto running phase, here the system is always in a running phase in the two-body\nphase space. This shoulder survives even in the many-body oscillations, which\ncould be tested in the experiments. We also show how these collective\noscillations evolve from two- to many-body. Our theory provides an alternative\nway to understand the collective dynamics in large-spin Fermi systems.\n", "  Hybrid lead-halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of\nphotovoltaic materials. Recent reports suggest that the organic molecular\ncation is responsible for local polar fluctuations that inhibit carrier\nrecombination. We combine low frequency Raman scattering with first-principles\nmolecular dynamics (MD) to study the fundamental nature of these local polar\nfluctuations. Our observations of a strong central peak in both hybrid\n(CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$) and all-inorganic (CsPbBr$_3$) lead-halide perovskites\nshow that anharmonic, local polar fluctuations are intrinsic to the general\nlead-halide perovskite structure, and not unique to the dipolar organic cation.\nMD simulations show that head-to-head Cs motion coupled to Br face expansion,\non a few hundred femtosecond time scale, drives the local polar fluctuations in\nCsPbBr$_3$.\n", "  The $S$-expansion framework is analyzed in the context of a freedom in\nclosing the multiplication tables for the abelian semigroups. Including the\npossibility of the zero element in the resonant decomposition and associating\nthe Lorentz generator with the semigroup identity element leads to the wide\nclass of the expanded Lie algebras introducing interesting modifications to the\ngauge gravity theories. Among the results, we find all the Maxwell algebras of\ntype $\\mathfrak{B}_m$, $\\mathfrak{C}_m$, and recently introduced\n$\\mathfrak{D}_m$. The additional new examples complete resulting generalization\nof the bosonic enlargements to an arbitrary number of the Lorentz-like and\ntranslational-like generators. Some further prospects concerning enlarging the\nalgebras are discussed, along with providing all the necessary constituents for\nconstructing the gravity actions based on the obtained results.\n", "  We report the investigation of a collimated blue light generated in rubidium\nvapor due to the combined action of an ultrashort pulse train and a cw diode\nlaser. Each step of the two-photon transition 5S - 5P$_{3/2}$ - 5D is excited\nby one of the lasers, and the induced coherence between the 5S and 6P$_{3/2}$\nstates is responsible for generating the blue beam. Measurements of the\nexcitation spectrum reveal the frequency comb structure, indicating that each\nindividual mode is responsible for inducing a nonlinear process. The strong\nsignal dependency on the atomic density is characterized by a sharp growth and\nrapid saturation.\n", "  We formulate the full bosonic SL(5) exceptional field theory in a\ncoordinate-invariant manner. Thereby we interpret the 10-dimensional extended\nspace as a manifold with $\\mathrm{SL}(5)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$-structure. We show\nthat the algebra of generalised diffeomorphisms closes subject to a set of\nclosure constraints which are reminiscent of the quadratic and linear\nconstraints of maximal seven-dimensional gauged supergravities, as well as the\nsection condition. We construct an action for the full bosonic SL(5)\nexceptional field theory, even when the\n$\\mathrm{SL}(5)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$-structure is not locally flat.\n", "  To solve the fine-tuning problem in $\\mu$-Term Hybrid Inflation, we will\nrealize the supersymmetry scenario with the TeV-scale supersymmetric particles\nand intermediate-scale gravitino from anomaly mediation, which can be\nconsistent with the WMAP and Planck experiments. Moreover, we for the first\ntime propose the $\\mu$-term hybrid inflation in no-scale supergravity. With\nfour Scenarios for the $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$\nmodel, we show that the correct scalar spectral index $n_s$ can be obtained,\nwhile the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ is prediced to be tiny, about\n$10^{-10}-10^{-8}$. Also, the $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking\nscale is around $10^{14}$ GeV, and all the supersymmetric particles except\ngravitino are around TeV scale while gravitino mass is around $10^{9-10}$ GeV.\nConsidering the complete potential terms linear in $S$, we for the first time\nshow that the tadpole term, which is the key for such kind of inflationary\nmodels to be consistent with the observed scalar spectral index, vanishes after\ninflation. Thus, to obtain the $\\mu$ term, we need to generate the\nsupersymmetry breaking soft term $A^{S \\Phi \\Phi'}_{\\kappa} \\kappa S \\Phi\n\\Phi'$ due to $A^{S \\Phi \\Phi'}_{\\kappa}=0 $ in no-scale supergravity, where\n$\\Phi$ and $\\Phi'$ are vector-like Higgs fields at high energy. We show that\nthe proper $A^{S \\Phi \\Phi'}_{\\kappa} \\kappa S \\Phi \\Phi'$ term can be obtained\nin the M-theory inspired no-scale supergravity. We also point out that $A^{S\n\\Phi \\Phi'}_{\\kappa}$ around 700 GeV can be generated via the renormalization\ngroup equation running from string scale.\n", "  Many systems in nature, from ferromagnets to flocks of birds, exhibit\nordering phenomena on the large scale. In physical systems order is\nstatistically robust for large enough dimensions, with relative fluctuations\ndue to noise vanishing with system size. Several biological systems, however,\nare less stable than their physical analogues and spontaneously change their\nglobal state on relatively short timescales. In this paper we show that there\nare two crucial ingredients in these systems that enhance the effect of noise,\nleading to collective changes of state: the non-symmetric nature of\ninteractions between individuals, and the presence of local heterogeneities in\nthe topology of the network. The consequences of these features can be larger\nthe larger the system size leading to a localization of the fluctuation modes\nand a relaxation time that remains finite in the thermodynamic limit. The\nsystem keeps changing its global state in time, being constantly driven out of\nequilibrium by spontaneous fluctuations. Our results explain what is observed\nin several living and social systems and are consistent with recent\nexperimental data on bird flocks and other animal groups.\n", "  We present the Fortran95 program Recola for the perturbative computation of\nnext-to-leading-order transition amplitudes in the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. The code provides numerical results in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge. It\nuses the complex-mass scheme and allows for a consistent isolation of resonant\ncontributions. Dimensional regularization is employed for ultraviolet and\ninfrared singularities, with the alternative possibility of treating collinear\nand soft singularities in mass regularization. Recola supports various\nrenormalization schemes for the electromagnetic and a dynamical Nf-flavour\nscheme for the strong coupling constant. The calculation of\nnext-to-leading-order squared amplitudes, summed over spin and colour, is\nsupported as well as the computation of colour- and spin-correlated\nleading-order squared amplitudes needed in the dipole subtraction formalism.\n", "  A new physical hypothesis predicts that a weak coupling of the orbital and\nrotational motions of extended bodies may give rise to a modulation of\ncirculatory flows within their atmospheres. Driven cycles of intensification\nand relaxation of large-scale circulatory flows are predicted, with the phasing\nof these changes linked directly to the rate of change of the orbital angular\nmomentum with respect to inertial frames. We test the hypothesis that\nglobal-scale dust storms (GDS) on Mars may occur when periods of circulatory\nintensification (associated with positive and negative extrema of the waveform)\ncoincide with the southern summer dust storm season on Mars. The orbit-spin\ncoupling hypothesis additionally predicts that the intervening transitional\nperiods, which are characterized by the disappearance and subsequent sign\nchange of this waveform, may be unfavorable for the occurrence of GDS, when\nthey occur during the southern summer dust storm season. These hypotheses are\nconfirmed through comparisons between calculated dynamical time series of the\ntime rate of change of orbital angular momentum and historic observations. All\nof the nine known global-scale dust storms on Mars took place during Mars years\nwhen circulatory intensification during the dust storm season is predicted\nunder the orbit-spin coupling hypothesis. No historic global-scale dust storms\nwere recorded during transitional intervals. Orbit-spin coupling accelerations\nevidently contribute to the interannual variability of the Mars atmosphere.\n", "  In this paper we present a customized finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD)\nMaxwell solver for the particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm. The solver is\ncustomized to effectively eliminate the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI)\nwhich arises when a plasma (neutral or non-neutral) relativistically drifts on\na grid when using the PIC algorithm. We control the EM dispersion curve in the\ndirection of the plasma drift of a FDTD Maxwell solver by using a customized\nhigher order finite difference operator for the spatial derivative along the\ndirection of the drift ($\\hat 1$ direction). We show that this eliminates the\nmain NCI modes with moderate $\\vert k_1 \\vert$, while keeps additional main NCI\nmodes well outside the range of physical interest with higher $\\vert k_1\n\\vert$. These main NCI modes can be easily filtered out along with first\nspatial aliasing NCI modes which are also at the edge of the fundamental\nBrillouin zone. The customized solver has the possible advantage of improved\nparallel scalability because it can be easily partitioned along $\\hat 1$ which\ntypically has many more cells than other directions for the problems of\ninterest. We show that FFTs can be performed locally to current on each\npartition to filter out the main and first spatial aliasing NCI modes, and to\ncorrect the current so that it satisfies the continuity equation for the\ncustomized spatial derivative. This ensures that Gauss' Law is satisfied. We\npresent simulation examples of one relativistically drifting plasmas, of two\ncolliding relativistically drifting plasmas, and of nonlinear laser wakefield\nacceleration (LWFA) in a Lorentz boosted frame that show no evidence of the NCI\ncan be observed when using this customized Maxwell solver together with its NCI\nelimination scheme.\n", "  It is well-known that the appearance of almost-empty (shallow) conduction\nbands in solids strongly affects their superconducting properties. In a shallow\nband charge carriers are depleted and have nearly zero velocities so that the\ncrossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is approached. Based on a two-band prototype\nsystem with one shallow and one deep band, we demonstrate that the fundamental\nphase diagram of the superconducting magnetic response changes qualitatively as\ncompared to standard superconductors with only deep bands. The so-called\nintertype (IT) domain between superconductivity types I and II systematically\nexpands in the phase diagram when passing from the BCS to BEC side: its width\nis inversely proportional to the squared Cooper-pair radius that shrinks\nseveral orders of magnitude through the crossover. We also show that the\ncoupling to a stable condensate of the deep band makes the system rather robust\nagainst the otherwise strong superconducting fluctuations. Thus, the BCS-BEC\ncrossover induced by a shallow band pushes standard superconductivity types\nwide apart so that the IT domain tends to dominate the phase diagram and\ntherefore the magnetic properties of shallow-band superconductors.\n", "  This resource letter provides a guide to research-based assessment\ninstruments (RBAIs) of physics and astronomy content. These are standardized\nassessments that were rigorously developed and revised using student ideas and\ninterviews, expert input, and statistical analyses. RBAIs have had a major\nimpact on physics and astronomy education reform by providing a universal and\nconvincing measure of student understanding that instructors can use to assess\nand improve the effectiveness of their teaching. In this resource letter, we\npresent an overview of all content RBAIs in physics and astronomy by topic,\nresearch validation, instructional level, format, and themes, to help faculty\nfind the best assessment for their course.\n", "  Coding technology is used in several information processing tasks. In\nparticular, when noise during transmission disturbs communications, coding\ntechnology is employed to protect the information. However, there are two types\nof coding technology: coding in classical information theory and coding in\nquantum information theory. Although the physical media used to transmit\ninformation ultimately obey quantum mechanics, we need to choose the type of\ncoding depending on the kind of information device, classical or quantum, that\nis being used. In both branches of information theory, there are many elegant\ntheoretical results under the ideal assumption that an infinitely large system\nis available. In a realistic situation, we need to account for finite size\neffects. The present paper reviews finite size effects in classical and quantum\ninformation theory with respect to various topics, including applied aspects.\n", "  Along with weaving together observations, experiments, and theoretical\nconstructs into a coherent mesh of understanding of the world around us,\nphysics over its past five centuries has continuously refined the base concepts\non which the whole framework is built. In quantum physics, first in\nnon-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar\nconcepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from\nthe classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying\nphysics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or\nan event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical\nto it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of\nunderlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative\nexplanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and\nincorrect physics.\n  As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state,\nphysics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no\nmeaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of\nany specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible\npositions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the\ndistribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state. Physics\ndeals with the universal, not the individual.\n", "  In quantum theory we refer to the probability of finding a particle between\npositions $x$ and $x+dx$ at the instant $t$, although we have no capacity of\npredicting exactly when the detection occurs. In this work, first we present an\nextended non-relativistic quantum formalism where space and time play\nequivalent roles. It leads to the probability of finding a particle between $x$\nand $x+dx$ during [$t$,$t+dt$]. Then, we find a Schr\\\"odinger-like equation for\na \"mirror\" wave function $\\phi(t,x)$ associated with the probability of\nmeasuring the system between $t$ and $t+dt$, given that detection occurs at\n$x$. In this framework, it is shown that energy measurements of a stationary\nstate display a non-zero dispersion, and that energy-time uncertainty arises\nfrom first principles. We show that a central result on arrival time, obtained\nthrough approaches that resort to {\\it ad hoc} assumptions, is a natural,\nbuilt-in part of the formalism presented here.\n", "  Till now the nanoscale focussing and imaging in the sub-diffraction limit is\nachieved mainly with the help of plasmonic field enhancement assisted with\nnoble metal nanoparticles. Using far field imaging technique, we have recorded\npolarized spectroscopic photoluminescence (PL) imaging of a single AlGaN\nnanowire (NW) of diameter ~ 100 nm using confinement of polarized light. The\nnanowires on the substrate have a nematic ordering. It is found that the PL\nfrom a single NW is influenced by the proximity to other NWs with the PL\nintensity scaling as 1/(lxd), where l and d are the NW length and the\nseparation from the neighbouring NW, respectively. We show that this proximity\ninduced PL intensity enhancement can be understood, if we assume the existence\nof reasonably long lived photons in the intervening space between the NWs. A\nnonzero non-equilibrium population of such photons causes stimulated emission\nleading to the enhanced PL emission with the intensity scaling as 1/(lxd). The\neffect is analogous to the Purcell enhancement of polarized optical emissions\ninduced by confined photons in micro-cavities. The enhancement of PL emission\nfacilitated the far field spectroscopic imaging of a single semiconducting\nnanowire in the sub-diffraction regime.\n", "  Due to the emergence of new high resolution numerical weather prediction\n(NWP) models and the availability of new or more reliable remote sensing data,\nthe importance of efficient spatial verification techniques is growing. Wavelet\ntransforms offer an effective framework to decompose spatial data into separate\n(and possibly orthogonal) scales and directions. Most wavelet based spatial\nverification techniques have been developed or refined in the last decade and\nconcentrate on assessing forecast performance (i.e. forecast skill or forecast\nerror) on distinct physical scales. Particularly during the last five years, a\nsignificant growth in meteorological applications could be observed. However, a\ncomparison with other scientific fields such as feature detection, image\nfusion, texture analysis, or facial and biometric recognition, shows that there\nis still a considerable, currently unused potential to derive useful diagnostic\ninformation. In order to tab the full potential of wavelet analysis, we revise\nthe state-of-the art in one- and two-dimensional wavelet analysis and its\napplication with emphasis on spatial verification. We further use a technique\ndeveloped for texture analysis in the context of high-resolution quantitative\nprecipitation forecasts, which is able to assess structural characteristics of\nthe precipitation fields and allows efficient clustering of ensemble data.\n", "  After reviewing the hole argument and its relations with initial value\nproblem and general covariance, we shall discuss how much freedom one has to\ndefine the physical state of a system in a generally covariant (or gauge\ncovariant) field theory. We shall show that in gauge covariant theories (and\ngenerally covariant theories with a a compact space) one has no freedom and one\nis forced to declare as physically equivalent two configurations which differ\nby a gauge transformation (or by a global spacetime diffeomorphism), as it is\nusually prescribed. On the contrary, when space is not compact, the result\nproven for the compact case does not hold true and one may have different\noptions to define physically equivalent configurations, still preserving\ndeterminism.\n", "  The dynamics of any spherical cosmology with a scalar field (`scalaron')\ncoupling to gravity is described by the nonlinear second-order differential\nequations for two metric functions and the scalaron depending on the `time'\nparameter. The equations depend on the scalaron potential and on the arbitrary\ngauge function that describes time parameterizations. This dynamical system can\nbe integrated for flat, isotropic models with very special potentials. But,\nsomewhat unexpectedly, replacing the `time' variable by one of the metric\nfunctions allows us to completely integrate the general spherical theory in any\ngauge and with apparently arbitrary potentials. The main restrictions on the\npotential arise from positivity of the derived analytic expressions for the\nsolutions, which are essentially the squared canonical momenta. An interesting\nconsequence is emerging of classically forbidden regions for these analytic\nsolutions. It is also shown that in this rather general model the inflationary\nsolutions can be identified, explicitly derived, and compared to the standard\napproximate expressions. This approach can be applied to intrinsically\nanisotropic models with a massive vector field (`vecton') as well as to some\nnon-inflationary models.\n", "  Total absorption, defined as the net flux of energy out of a bounded region\naveraged over one cycle for time harmonic motion, must be non-negative when\nthere are no sources of energy within the region. This passivity condition\nplaces constraints on the non-dimensional absorption coefficients of\nlongitudinal and transverse waves, $\\gamma_L$ and $\\gamma_T$, in isotropic\nlinearly viscoelastic materials. Typically, $\\gamma_L, \\, \\gamma_T$ are small,\nin which case the constraints imply that coefficients of attenuation per unit\nlength, $\\alpha_L$, $\\alpha_T$, must satisfy the inequality\n${\\alpha_L}/{\\alpha_T} \\ge { 4c_{T}^3} / { 3c_{L}^3}$ where $c_L$, $c_T$ are\nthe wave speeds. This inequality, which as far as the author is aware, has not\nbeen presented before, provides a relative bound on wave speed in terms of\nattenuation, or {\\it vice versa}. It also serves as a check on the consistency\nof ultrasonic measurements from the literature, with most but not all of the\ndata considered passing the positive absorption test.\n", "  We derive a non-dimensional metric to quantify the expected Lagrangian\npersistence of objectively defined Eulerian vortices in two-dimensional\nunsteady flows. This persistence metric is the averaged deviation of the\nvorticity from its spatial mean over the Eulerian vortex, normalized by the\ninstantaneous material leakage from the Eulerian vortex. The metric offers a\nmodel-independent and frame-independent tool for uncovering the instantaneous\nEulerian signature of long-lived Lagrangian vortices. Using satellite-derived\nocean velocity data, we show that Lagrangian vortex-persistence predictions by\nour metric significantly outperform those inferred from other customary\nEulerian diagnostics, such as the potential vorticity gradient and the\nOkubo-Weiss criterion.\n", "  While any two-dimensional mixed state of polarization of light can be\nrepresented by a combination of a pure state and a fully random state, any\nMueller matrix can be represented by a convex combination of a pure component\nand three additional components whose randomness is scaled in a proper and\nobjective way. Such characteristic decomposition constitutes the appropriate\nframework for the characterization of the polarimetric randomness of the system\nrepresented by a given Mueller matrix, and provides criteria for the optimal\nfiltering of noise in experimental polarimetry.\n", "  Mountain-generated inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) affect the dynamics of both\nthe atmosphere and the ocean through the mean force they exert as they interact\nwith the flow. A key to this interaction is the presence of critical-level\nsingularities or, when planetary rotation is taken into account, inertial-level\nsingularities, where the Doppler-shifted wave frequency matches the local\nCoriolis frequency. We examine the role of the latter singularities by studying\nthe steady wavepacket generated by a multiscale mountain in a rotating linear\nshear flow at low Rossby number. Using a combination of WKB and saddle-point\napproximations, we provide an explicit description of the form of the\nwavepacket, of the mean forcing it induces, and of the mean-flow response.\n  We identify two distinguished regimes of wave propagation: Regime I applies\nfar enough from a dominant inertial level for the standard ray-tracing\napproximation to be valid; Regime II applies to a thin region where the\nwavepacket structure is controlled by the inertial-level singularities. The\nwave--mean-flow interaction is governed by the change in Eliassen--Palm (or\npseudomomentum) flux. This change is localised in a thin inertial layer where\nthe wavepacket takes a limiting form of that found in Regime II. We solve a\nquasi-geostrophic potential-vorticity equation forced by the divergence of the\nEliassen--Palm flux to compute the wave-induced mean flow. Our results,\nobtained in an inviscid limit, show that the wavepacket reaches a\nlarge-but-finite distance downstream of the mountain (specifically, a distance\nof order $k_*^{1/2} \\Delta^{3/2}$, where $k_*^{-1}$ and $\\Delta$ measure the\nwave and envelope scales of the mountain) and extends horizontally over a\nsimilar scale.\n", "  Nonlinear waves that collide with localized defects exhibit complex behavior.\nApart from reflection, transmission, and annihilation of an incident wave, a\nlocal inhomogeneity can activate internal modes of solitons, producing many\nimpressive phenomena. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional\nsine-Gordon model perturbed by a family of localized forces. We observed the\nformation of bubble-like and drop-like structures due to local internal shape\nmodes instabilities. We describe the formation of such structures on the basis\nof a one-dimensional theory of activation of internal modes of sG solitons. An\ninterpretation of the observed phenomena, in the context of phase transitions\ntheory, is given. Implications in Josephson junctions with a current dipole\ndevice are discussed.\n", "  In the design of a diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) consisting of\ncompact multi-bend achromats (MBAs), it is challenging to simultaneously\nachieve an ultralow emittance and a satisfactory nonlinear performance, due to\nextremely large nonlinearities and limited tuning ranges of the element\nparameters. Nevertheless, taking the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS) as an\nexample, we demonstrate that the potential of a DLSR design can be explored\nwith a successive and iterative implementation of the particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) and multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). It turns out\nthat with a hybrid MBA lattice, it is feasible for the HEPS to attain a natural\nemittance of about 50 pm.rad, and meanwhile, realize a sufficient ring\nacceptance for beam accumulation with an on-axis longitudinal injection scheme.\nParticularly, this study indicates that a rational combination of the PSO and\nMOGA is more effective than either of them alone in approaching the true global\noptima, for an explorative multi-objective problem with many optimizing\nvariables and local optima.\n", "  A variety of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (APbX3) consisting of mixed\ncenter cations [A = CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+, Cs+] with different PbX3- cages (X = I,\nBr, Cl) have been developed to realize high-efficiency solar cells.\nNevertheless, clear understanding for the effects of A and X on the optical\ntransition has been lacking. Here, we present universal rules that allow the\nunified interpretation of the optical absorption in various hybrid perovskites.\nIn particular, we find that the influence of the A-site cation on the light\nabsorption is rather significant and the absorption coefficient (alpha) reduces\nto half when CH3NH3+ is replaced with HC(NH2)2+ in the APbI3 system. Our\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce all of the fine\nabsorption features observed in HC(NH2)2PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, allowing the\nunique assignment of the interband transitions in the Brillouin zone. In\ncontrast to general understanding that the A-site cation involves weakly in the\noptical process, our theoretical calculations reveal that the center cation\nplays a critical role in the interband transition and the absorption strength\nin the visible region is modified by the strong A-X interaction. Furthermore,\nour systematic analyses show that the variation of the absorption spectrum with\nX can be described simply by the well-known sum rule. The universal rules\nestablished in this study explain the large reduction of alpha in HC(NH2)2PbI3\nand predict CsPbI3 as the highest alpha material.\n", "  Horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) are graphs constructed in correspondence\nwith number sequences that have been introduced and explored recently in the\ncontext of graph-theoretical time series analysis. In most of the cases simple\nmeasures based on the degree sequence (or functionals of these such as\nentropies over degree and joint degree distributions) appear to be highly\ninformative features for automatic classification and provide nontrivial\ninformation on the associated dynam- ical process, working even better than\nmore sophisticated topological metrics. It is thus an open question why these\nseemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that,\nunder suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix\nof an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such\nbijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the\ndegree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby\ngiving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the self-sustained, star-shaped oscillations of\nLeidenfrost drops. The drops levitate on a cushion of evaporated vapor over a\nheated, curved surface. We observe modes with $n = 2-13$ lobes around the drop\nperiphery. We find that the wavelength of the oscillations depends only on the\ncapillary length of the liquid, and is independent of the drop radius and\nsubstrate temperature. However, the number of observed modes depends\nsensitively on the liquid viscosity. The dominant frequency of pressure\nvariations in the vapor layer is approximately twice the drop oscillation\nfrequency, consistent with a parametric forcing mechanism. Our results show\nthat the star-shaped oscillations are driven by capillary waves of a\ncharacteristic wavelength beneath the drop, and that the waves are generated by\na large shear stress at the liquid-vapor interface.\n", "  The in-medium sum rules are employed to calculate the shifts in the mass and\nresidue as well as the scalar and vector self-energies of the heavy $\\Lambda_Q,\n\\Sigma_Q$ and $\\Xi_Q$ baryons, with Q being $b$ or $c$ quark. The maximum shift\nin mass due to nuclear matter belongs to the $\\Sigma_c$ baryon and it is found\nto be $\\Delta m_{\\Sigma_{c}}=-936 ~ MeV$. In the case of residue, it is\nobtained that the residue of $\\Sigma_b$ baryon is maximally affected by the\nnuclear medium with the shift $\\Delta \\lambda_{\\Sigma_b} = -0.014 ~ GeV^3 $.\nThe scalar and vector self-energies are found to be $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Lambda_b} =\n653 ~ MeV$, $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Sigma_b} = -614 ~ MeV $, $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Xi_b} = -17 ~\nMeV $, $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Lambda_c} = 272 ~ MeV $, $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Sigma_c} = -936 ~\nMeV $, $\\Sigma^{S}_{\\Xi_c} = -5 ~ MeV $ and $\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Lambda_b} = 436 \\pm\n148 ~ MeV $, $\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Sigma_b} = 382 \\pm 129 ~MeV $,\n$\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Xi_b} =15 \\pm 5 ~ MeV$, $\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Lambda_c} = 151 \\pm 45\n~ MeV $, $\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Sigma_c} = 486 \\pm 144 ~ MeV $ and\n$\\Sigma^{\\nu}_{\\Xi_c} = 1.391 \\pm 0.529 ~ MeV $.\n", "  Stabilizer states are extensively studied in quantum information theory for\ntheir structures based on the Pauli group. Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)\nstabilizer states are of particular importance in their application to\nfault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, how to fault-tolerantly\nprepare arbitrary CSS stabilizer states for general CSS stabilizer codes is\nstill unknown, and their preparation can be highly costly in computational\nresources. In this paper, we show how to prepare a large class of CSS\nstabilizer states useful for FTQC. We propose distillation protocols using\nsyndrome encoding by classical codes or quantum CSS codes. Along the same\nlines, we show that classical coding techniques can reduce the ancilla\nconsumption in Steane syndrome extraction by using additional transversal\ncontrolled-NOT gates and classical computing power. In the scenario of a fixed\nancilla consumption rate, we can increase the frequency of quantum error\ncorrection and effectively lower the error rate.\n", "  For finite-dimensional quantum systems, such as qubits, a well established\nstrategy to protect such systems from decoherence is dynamical decoupling.\nHowever many promising quantum devices, such as oscillators, are infinite\ndimensional, for which the question if dynamical decoupling could be applied\nremained open. Here we first show that not every infinite-dimensional system\ncan be protected from decoherence through dynamical decoupling. Then we develop\ndynamical decoupling for continuous variable systems which are described by\nquadratic Hamiltonians. We identify a condition and a set of operations that\nallow us to map a set of interacting harmonic oscillators onto a set of\nnon-interacting oscillators rotating with an averaged frequency, a procedure we\ncall homogenization. Furthermore we show that every quadratic\nsystem-environment interaction can be suppressed with two simple operations\nacting only on the system. Using a random dynamical decoupling or\nhomogenization scheme, we develop bounds that characterize how fast we have to\nwork in order to achieve the desired uncoupled dynamics. This allows us to\nidentify how well homogenization can be achieved and decoherence can be\nsuppressed in continuous variable systems.\n", "  Chalcopyrite semiconductors are of considerable interest for application as\nabsorber layers in thin-film photovoltaic cells. When growing films of these\ncompounds, however, they are often found to contain CuAu- like domains, a\nmetastable phase of chalcopyrite. It has been reported that for CuInS2, the\npresence of the CuAu-like phase improves the short circuit current of the\nchalcopyrite-based photovoltaic cell. We investigate the thermodynamic\nstability of both phases for a selected list of I-III-VI2 materials using a\nfirst-principles density functional theory approach. For the CuIn-VI2\ncompounds, the difference in formation energy between the chalcopyrite and\nCuAu-like phase is found to be close to 2 meV/atom, indicating a high\nlikelihood of the presence of CuAu-like domains. Next, we calculate the\nSpectroscopic Limited Maximum Efficiency (SLME) of the CuAu- like phase and\ncompare the results with those of the corresponding chalcopyrite phase. We\nidentify several candidates with a high efficiency, such as CuAu-like CuInS2,\nfor which we obtain an SLME of 29% at a thickness of 500 nm. We observe that\nthe SLME can have values above the Shockley-Queisser (SQ) limit, and show that\nthis can occur because the SQ limit assumes the absorptivity to be a step\nfunction, thus overestimating the radiative recombination in the detailed\nbalance approach. This means that it is possible to find higher theoretical\nefficiencies within this framework simply by calculating the J-V characteristic\nwith an absorption spectrum. Finally, we expand our SLME analysis to indirect\nband gap absorbers by studying silicon, and find that the SLME quickly\noverestimates the reverse saturation current of indirect band gap materials,\ndrastically lowering their calculated efficiency.\n", "  We consider a model based on $A_4$ symmetry to explain the phenomenon of\nneutrino mixing. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of $A_4$ symmetry leads to a\nco-bimaximal mixing matrix at leading order. We consider the effect of higher\norder corrections in neutrino sector and find that the mixing angles thus\nobtained, come well within the $3\\sigma$ ranges of their experimental values.\nWe study the implications of this formalism on the other phenomenological\nobservables, such as CP violating phase, Jarlskog invariant and the effective\nMajorana mass $|M_{ee}|$. We also obtain the branching ratio of the lepton\nflavour violating decay $\\mu\\rightarrow e \\gamma$ in the context of this model\nand find that it can be less than its present experimental upper bound.\n", "  Using frequency-chirped radiation pressure slowing, we precisely control the\nvelocity of a pulsed CaF molecular beam down to a few m/s, compressing its\nvelocity spread by a factor of 10 while retaining high intensity: at a velocity\nof 15~m/s the flux, measured 1.3~m from the source, is 7$\\times$10$^{5}$\nmolecules per cm$^{2}$ per shot in a single rovibrational state. The beam is\nsuitable for loading a magneto-optical trap or, when combined with transverse\nlaser cooling, improving the precision of spectroscopic measurements that test\nfundamental physics. We compare the frequency-chirped slowing method with the\nmore commonly used frequency-broadened slowing method.\n", "  The quantization of energy levels in very nanoparticles suppresses\ndissipative processes that convert grain rotational kinetic energy into heat.\nFor grains small enough to have GHz rotation rates, the suppression of\ndissipation can be extreme. As a result, alignment of such grains is\nsuppressed. This applies both to alignment of the grain body with its angular\nmomentum J, and to alignment of J with the local magnetic field B_0. If the\nanomalous microwave emission is rotational emission from spinning grains, it\nwill be negligibly polarized at GHz frequencies, with P < 10^{-6} at\nfrequencies above 10 GHz.\n", "  We introduce a new family of symmetric multivariate polynomials, whose\ncoefficients are meromorphic functions of two parameters $(q,t)$ and polynomial\nin a further two parameters $(u,v)$. We evaluate these polynomials explicitly\nas a matrix product. At $u=v=0$ they reduce to Macdonald polynomials, while at\n$q=0$, $u=v=s$ they recover a family of inhomogeneous symmetric functions\noriginally introduced by Borodin.\n", "  We introduce a practical dielectric metasurface design for microwave\nfrequencies. The metasurface is made of an array of dielectric resonators held\ntogether by dielectric connections thus avoiding the need of a mechanical\nsupport in the form of a dielectric slab and the spurious multiple reflections\nthat such a slab would generate. The proposed design can be used either for\nbroadband metasurface applications or monochromatic wave transformations. The\ncapabilities of the concept to manipulate the transmission phase and amplitude\nof the metasurface are supported by numerical and experimental results.\nFinally, a half-wave plate and a quarter-wave plate have been realized with the\nproposed concept.\n", "  We analyze the Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) Higgs decay h -> tau mu in three\nsupersymmetric models: Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),\nSupersymmetric Seesaw Model (SSM), and Supersymmetric B-L model with Inverse\nSeesaw (BLSSM-IS). We show that in generic MSSM, with non-universal slepton\nmasses and/or trilinear couplings, it is not possible to enhance BR(h -> tau\nmu) without violating the experimental bound on the BR(tau -> mu gamma). In\nSSM, where flavor mixing is radiatively generated, the LFV process mu -> e\ngamma strictly constrains the parameter space and the maximum value of BR(h ->\ntau mu) is of order 10^-10, which is extremely smaller than the recent results\nreported by the CMS and ATLAS experiments. In BLSSM-IS, with universal soft\nSUSY breaking terms at the grand unified scale, we emphasize that the measured\nvalues of BR(h -> tau mu) can be accommodated in a wide region of parameter\nspace without violating LFV constraints. Thus, confirming the LFV Higgs decay\nresults will be a clear signal of BLSSM-IS type of models. Finally, the signal\nof h -> tau mu in the BLSSM-IS at the LHC, which has a tiny background, is\nanalyzed.\n", "  We revisit the equilibrium one-dimensional $\\phi^4$ model from the dynamical\nsystems point of view. We find an infinite number of periodic orbits which are\ncomputationally stable. At the same time some of the orbits are found to\nexhibit positive Lyapunov exponents! The periodic orbits confine every particle\nin a periodic chain to trace out either the same or a mirror-image trajectory\nin its two-dimensional phase space. These \"computationally stable\" sets of\npairs of single-particle orbits are either symmetric or antisymmetric to the\nvery last computational bit. In such a periodic chain the odd-numbered and\neven-numbered particles' coordinates and momenta are either identical or differ\nonly in sign. \"Positive Lyapunov exponents\" can and do result if an\ninfinitesimal perturbation breaking a perfect two-dimensional antisymmetry is\nintroduced so that the motion expands into a four-dimensional phase space. In\nthat extended space a positive exponent results.\n  We formulate a standard initial condition for the investigation of the\nmicrocanonical chaotic number dependence of the model. We speculate on the\nuniqueness of the model's chaotic sea and on the connection of such collections\nof deterministic and time-reversible states to the Second Law of\nThermodynamics.\n", "  Resonant production of color octet electron, e_{8}, at the FCC based ep\ncolliders has been analyzed. It is shown that e-FCC will cover much a wider\nregion of e_{8} masses compared to the LHC. Moreover, with highest electron\nbeam energy, e_{8} search potential of the e-FCC exceeds that of FCC pp\ncollider. If e_{8} is discovered earlier by the FCC pp collider, e-FCC will\ngive opportunity to handle very important additional information. For example,\ncompositeness scale can be probed up to hundreds TeV region.\n", "  A two-dimensional topological insulator may arise in a centrosymmetric\ncommensurate N\\'{e}el antiferromagnet (AF), where staggered magnetization\nbreaks both the elementary translation and time reversal, but retains their\nproduct as a symmetry. Fang et al.[Phys. Rev. B 88, 085406 (2013)] proposed an\nexpression for a $Z_2$ topological invariant to characterize such systems.\nHere, we show that this expression does not allow to detect all the existing\nphases if a certain lattice symmetry is lacking. We implement numerical\ntechniques to diagnose topological phases of a toy Hamiltonian, and verify our\nresults by computing the Chern numbers of degenerate bands, and also by\nexplicitly constructing the edge states, thus illustrating the efficiency of\nthe method.\n", "  Null results from dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments and the 125\nGeV Higgs both pose serious challenges to minimal supersymmetry. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple extension of the MSSM that economically solves both\nproblems: a \"dark sector\" consisting of a singlet and a pair of $SU(2)$\ndoublets. Loops of the dark sector fields help lift the Higgs mass to 125 GeV\nconsistent with naturalness, while the lightest fermion in the dark sector can\nbe viable thermal relic DM, provided that it is mostly singlet. The DM relic\nabundance is controlled by s-wave annihilation to tops and Higgsinos, leading\nto a tight relation between the relic abundance and the spin-dependent direct\ndetection cross section. As a result, the model will be fully probed by the\nnext generation of direct detection experiments. Finally we discuss the\ndiscovery potential at LHC Run II.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like topological excitations recently\ndiscovered in chiral magnets. Their small size, topological protection and the\nease with which they can be manipulated by electric currents generated much\ninterest in using skyrmions for information storage and processing. Recently,\nit was suggested that skyrmions with additional degrees of freedom can exist in\nmagnetically frustrated materials. Here, we show that dynamics of skyrmions and\nantiskyrmions in nanostripes of frustrated magnets is strongly affected by\ncomplex spin states formed at the stripe edges. These states create multiple\nedge channels which guide the skyrmion motion. Non-trivial topology of edge\nstates gives rise to complex current-induced dynamics, such as emission of\nskyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs. The edge state topology can be controlled with an\nelectric current through the exchange of skyrmions and antiskyrmions between\nthe edges of a magnetic nanostructure. These results can lead to conceptually\nnew electronic devices.\n", "  A theoretical foundation is developed for active seismic reconstruction of\nfractures endowed with spatially-varying interfacial condition\n(e.g.~partially-closed fractures, hydraulic fractures). The proposed indicator\nfunctional carries a superior localization property with no significant\nsensitivity to the fracture's contact condition, measurement errors, and\nillumination frequency. This is accomplished through the paradigm of the\n$F_\\sharp$-factorization technique and the recently developed Generalized\nLinear Sampling Method (GLSM) applied to elastodynamics. The direct scattering\nproblem is formulated in the frequency domain where the fracture surface is\nilluminated by a set of incident plane waves, while monitoring the induced\nscattered field in the form of (elastic) far-field patterns. The analysis of\nthe well-posedness of the forward problem leads to an admissibility condition\non the fracture's (linearized) contact parameters. This in turn contributes\ntoward establishing the applicability of the $F_\\sharp$-factorization method,\nand consequently aids the formulation of a convex GLSM cost functional whose\nminimizer can be computed without iterations. Such minimizer is then used to\nconstruct a robust fracture indicator function, whose performance is\nillustrated through a set of numerical experiments. For completeness, the\nresults of the GLSM reconstruction are compared to those obtained by the\nclassical linear sampling method (LSM).\n", "  We consider non-linear wave type solutions with mass scale parameter and\nvahished canonical spin density operator in a pure SU(2) quantum chtomodynamics\n(QCD). A new stationary solution which can be treated as a system of static\nWu-Yang monopole dressed in off-diagonal gluon field is proposed. A remarkable\nfeature of such a solution is that it possesses a finite energy density\neverywhere. All considered non-linear wave type solutions have common features:\npresence of a mass scale parameter, non-vanishing projection of the color\nmagnetic field along the propagation direction and zero spin density. The last\nproperty requires revision of the gauge invariant definition of the spin\ndensity operator which supposed to be massless vector field in the classical\ntheory. We construct a gauge invariant definition of the classical gluon spin\ndensity which is unique and Lorentz frame independent.\n", "  A similarity transformation for the mean velocity profiles is obtained in\nsink flow turbulent boundary layers (TBL), including effects of blowing and\nsuction. It is based on symmetry analysis which transforms the governing\npartial differential equations (for mean mass and momentum) into an ordinary\ndifferential equation and yields a new result including an exact, linear\nrelation between the mean normal ($V$) and streamwise ($U$) velocities. A\ncharacteristic length is further introduced which, under a first order\nexpansion in wall blowing/suction velocity, leads to the similarity\ntransformation for $U$. This transformation is shown to be a group invariant\nunder a generalized symmetry analysis and maps different $U$ profiles under\ndifferent blowing/suction conditions into a (universal) profile under no\nblowing/suction. Its inverse transformation enables predictions of all mean\nquantities in the mean mass and momentum equations - $U$, $V$ and the Reynolds\nshear stress - in good agreement with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data.\n", "  Recently, new observables in LHC inclusive events with three tagged jets were\nproposed. Here, we extend that proposal to events with four tagged jets. The\nevents are characterised by one jet in the forward direction, one in the\nbackward direction with a large rapidity distance $Y$ from the first one and\ntwo more jets tagged in more central regions of the detector. In our setup,\nnon-tagged associated mini-jet multiplicity is present and needs to be\naccounted for by the inclusion of BFKL gluon Green functions. The projection of\nthe cross section on azimuthal-angle components opens up the opportunity for\ndefining new ratios of correlation functions of the azimuthal angle differences\namong the tagged jets that can be used as probes of the BFKL dynamics.\n", "  Exploring inelastic and reactive collisions on the quantum level is a main\ngoal of the developing field of ultracold chemistry. We present first\nexperimental studies of inelastic collisions of metastable ultracold triplet\nmolecules in the vibrational ground state. The measurements are performed with\nnonpolar $\\textrm{Rb}_2$ dimers which are prepared in precisely-defined quantum\nstates and trapped in an array of quasi-1D potential tubes. In particular, we\ninvestigate collisions of molecules in the absolute lowest triplet energy level\nwhere any inelastic process requires a change of the electronic state.\nNevertheless, we find similar decay rates as for collisions between\nrotationally or vibrationally excited triplet molecules and they are close to\nthe rates for universal reactions. As anticipated theoretically, the measured\ndecay rate constants vary considerably when confinement and collision energy\nare changed. This might be exploited to control the collisional properties of\nmolecules.\n", "  It is well-known that conformal embeddings can be used to construct\nnon-diagonal modular invariants for affine lie algebras. This idea can be\nextended to construct infinite series of non-diagonal modular invariants for\ncoset CFTs. In this paper, we systematically approach the problem of\nidentifying higher-spin bulk duals for these kind of non-diagonal invariants.\nIn particular, for a special value of the 't Hooft coupling, there exist a\nclass of partition functions that have enhanced supersymmetry, which should be\nreflected in a bulk dual. As a illustration of this, we show that a partition\nfunction of a orthogonal group coset CFT has a $\\mathcal N=1$ supersymmetric\nhigher-spin bulk dual, in the 't Hooft limit. We also propose that two of the\nseries of CFT partition functions, obtained from conformal embeddings, are\nequal, generalising the well-known dual interpretation of the 3-state Potts\nmodel as a $\\frac{SU(2)_3 \\otimes SU(2)_1}{SU(2)_4}$ and also as a\n$\\frac{SU(3)_1 \\otimes SU(3)_1}{SU(3)_2}$ coset model.\n", "  We present a mixer-duplexer-antenna leaky-wave system based on periodic\nspace-time modulation. This system operates as a full transceiver, where the\nupconversion and downconversion mixing operations are accomplished via\nspace-time transitions, the duplexing operation is induced by the nonreciprocal\nnature of the structure, and the radiation operation is provided by the\nleaky-wave nature of the wave. A rigorous electromagnetic solution is derived\nfor the dispersion relation and field distributions. The system is implemented\nin the form of a spatio-temporally modulated microstrip leaky-wave structure\nincorporating an array of sub-wavelengthly spaced varactors modulated by a\nharmonic wave. In addition to the overall mixer-duplexer-antenna operation,\nfrequency beam scanning at fixed input frequency is demonstrated as one of the\ninteresting features of the system. A prototype is realized and demonstrated by\nfull-wave and experimental results.\n", "  In the study of non-equilibrium polariton condensates it is usually assumed\nthat the dispersion relation of polaritons is parabolic in nature. We show that\nconsidering the true non-parabolic kinetic energy of polaritons leads to\nsignificant changes in the behaviour of the condensate due to the curvature of\nthe dispersion relation and the possibility of transfer of energy to high\nwavenumber components in the condensate spatial profile. We present explicit\nsolutions for plane waves and linear excitations, and identify the differences\nin the theoretical predictions between the parabolic and non-parabolic\nmean-field models, showing the possibility of symmetry breaking in the latter.\nWe then consider the evolution of wavepackets and show that self-localisation\neffects may be observed due to the curvature of the dispersion relation.\nFinally, we revisit the dynamics of dark soliton trains and show that\nadditional localized density excitations may emerge in the dynamics due to the\nexcitation of high frequency components, mimicking the appearance of\nnear-bright solitary waves over short timescales.\n", "  Some of the most exotic material properties derive from electronic states\nwith short correlation length (~10-500 {\\AA}), suggesting that the local\nstructural symmetry may play a relevant role in their behavior. Here we discuss\nthe combined use of polarized x-ray absorption fine structure and x-ray\ndiffraction at high pressure as a powerful method to tune and probe structural\nand electronic orders at multiple length scales. Besides addressing some of the\ntechnical challenges associated with such experiments, we illustrate this\napproach with results obtained in the cuprate La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_4$,\nin which the response of electronic order to pressure can only be understood by\nprobing the structure at the relevant length scales.\n", "  We construct correlators in the $W_4$ Toda 2d conformal field theory for a\nparticular class of representations and demonstrate a relation to a $W_2$\n(Virasoro) theory with different central charge. The relevance of the classical\nlimits of the constructed 3-point functions and braiding matrices to problems\nin 4d conformal theories is discussed.\n", "  The problem of time in quantum mechanics concerns the fact that in the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation time is a parameter, not an operator. Pauli's objection\nto a time-energy uncertainty relation analogue to the position-momentum one,\nconjectured by Heisenberg early on, seemed to exclude the existence of such an\noperator. However Dirac's formulation of electron's relativistic quantum\nmechanics (RQM) does allow the introduction of a dynamical time operator that\nis self-adjoint. Consequently, it can be considered as the generator of a\nunitary transformation of the system,as well as an additional system observable\nsubject to uncertainty. In the present paper these aspects are examined within\nthe standard framework of RQM.\n", "  CaFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a $S={5\\over 2}$ anisotropic antiferromagnet based upon\nzig-zag chains having two competing magnetic structures, denoted as the A\n($\\uparrow \\uparrow \\downarrow \\downarrow$) and B ($\\uparrow \\downarrow\n\\uparrow \\downarrow$) phases, which differ by the $c$-axis stacking of\nferromagnetic stripes. We apply neutron scattering to demonstrate that the\ncompeting A and B phase order parameters results in magnetic antiphase\nboundaries along $c$ which freeze on the timescale of $\\sim$ 1 ns at the onset\nof magnetic order at 200 K. Using high resolution neutron spectroscopy, we find\nquantized spin wave levels and measure 9 such excitations localized in regions\n$\\sim$ 1-2 $c$-axis lattice constants in size. We discuss these in the context\nof solitary magnons predicted to exist in anisotropic systems. The magnetic\nanisotropy affords both competing A+B orders as well as localization of spin\nexcitations in a classical magnet.\n", "  The evolution of material points interacting via gravitational force in 3D\nspace was investigated. At initial moment points with masses of 2.48 Sun masses\nare randomly distributed inside a cube with an edge of 5 light-years. The\nmodeling was conducted at different initial distributions of velocities and\ndifferent ratios between potential and kinetic energy of the points. As a\nresult of modeling the time dependence of velocity distribution function of\npoints was obtained. Dependence of particles fraction which had evaporated from\ninitial cluster on time for different initial conditions is obtained. In\nparticular, it was obtained that the fraction of evaporated particles varies\nbetween 0,45 and 0,63. Mutual diffusion of two classes of particles at\ndifferent initial conditions in the case when at initial moment of time both\nclasses of particles occupy equal parts of cube was investigated. The maximum\nLyapunov exponent of the system with different initial conditions was\ncalculated. The obtained value weakly depends on the ratio between initial\nkinetic and potential energies and amounts approximately 10^-5. Corresponding\ntime of the particle trajectories divergence turned out to be 40-50 thousand\nyears.\n", "  We study the nuclear medium effects in Drell-Yan process using quark parton\ndistribution functions calculated in a microscopic nuclear model which takes\ninto account the effects of Fermi motion, nuclear binding and nucleon\ncorrelations through a relativistic nucleon spectral function. The\ncontributions of $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ mesons as well as shadowing effects are also\nincluded.\n  The beam energy loss is calculated using a phenomenological approach. The\npresent theoretical results are compared with the experimental results of E772\nand E886 experiments. These results are applicable to the forthcoming\nexperimental analysis of E906 Sea Quest experiment at Fermi Lab.\n", "  We address the validity of the formalism and results presented in [ S. Das,\nPhys. Rev. {\\bf D89} 084068 (2014)] with regard to quantum Raychaudhuri\nequation. The author obtained the so called quantum Raychaudhuri equation by\nreplacing classical geodesics with quantal trajectories arising from Bhommian\nmechanics. The resulting modified equation was used to draw some conclusions\nabout the inevitability of focussing and the formation of conjugate points and\ntherefore singularity. We show that the whole procedure is full of problematic\npoints, on both physical relevancy and mathematical correctness. In particular,\nwe illustrate the problems associated with the technical derivation of the so\ncalled quantum Raychaudhuri equation, as well as its invalid physical\nimplications.\n", "  A novel class of boundary conditions is introduced as a generalization of the\npreviously defined class of soft-and-hard/DB (SHDB) boundary conditions. It is\nshown that the conditions for the generalized soft-and-hard/DB (GSHDB) boundary\narise most naturally in a simple and straightforward manner by applying\nfour-dimensional differential-form and dyadic formalism. At a given boundary\nsurface, the GSHDB conditions are governed by two one-forms. In terms of\nGibbsian 3D vector and dyadic algebra the GSHDB conditions are defined in terms\nof two vectors tangential to the boundary surface and two scalars. Considering\nplane-wave reflection from the GSHDB boundary, for two eigenpolarizations, the\nGSHDB boundary can be replaced by the PEC or PMC boundary. Special attention is\npaid to the problem of plane waves matched to the GSHDB boundary, defined by a\n2D dispersion equation for the wave vector, making the reflection dyadic\nindeterminate. Examples of dispersion curves for various chosen parameters of\nthe GSHDB boundary are given. Conditions for a possible medium whose interface\nacts as a GSHDB boundary are discussed.\n", "  We study the hydrodynamics of a gas of noninteracting Weyl fermions coupled\nto the electromagnetic field in $(2N + 1) + 1$ spacetime dimensions using the\nchiral kinetic theory, which encodes the gauge anomaly in the Chern character\nof the nonabelian Berry connection over the Fermi surface. We derive the\nanomalous contributions to the relativistic hydrodynamic currents in\nequilibrium and at a finite temperature, which agree with and provides an\napproach complementary to the results derived previously using thermodynamic\nconstraints.\n", "  We investigate the ground state properties of anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose\ngases in one dimensional harmonic potential from the weak repulsion regime to\nthe strong repulsion regime. By diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the Hilbert\nspace composed of the lowest eigenstates of single particle and spin\ncomponents, the ground state wavefunction and therefore the density\ndistributions, magnetization distribution, one body density matrix, and\nmomentum distribution for each components are obtained. It is shown that the\nspinor Bose gases of different magnetization exhibit the same total density\nprofiles in the full interaction regime, which evolve from the single peak\nstructure embodying the properties of Bose gases to the fermionized shell\nstructure of spin-polarized fermions. But each components display different\ndensity profiles, and magnetic domains emerge in the strong interaction limit\nfor $M=0.25$. In the strong interaction limit, one body density matrix and the\nmomentum distributions exhibit the same behaviours as those of spin-polarized\nfermions. The fermionization of momentum distribution takes place, in contrast\nto the $\\delta$-function-like distribution of single component Bose gases in\nthe full interaction region.\n", "  By investigating the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills matrix model coupled to fundamental\nfermions in the adiabatic limit, we demonstrate quantum critical behaviour at\nspecial corners of the gauge field configuration space. The quantum scalar\npotential for the gauge field induced by the fermions diverges at the corners,\nand is intimately related to points of enhanced degeneracy of the fermionic\nHamiltonian. This in turn leads to superselection sectors in the Hilbert space\nof the gauge field, the ground states in different sectors being orthogonal to\neach other. As a consequence of our analysis, we show that 2-color QCD coupled\nto two Weyl fermions has three quantum phases. When coupled to a massless Dirac\nfermion, the number of quantum phases is four. One of these phases is the\ncolor-spin locked phase.\n", "  We report ferrielectricity in a single-phase crystal, TSCC -- tris-sarcosine\ncalcium chloride [(CH3NHCH2COOH)3CaCl2]. Ferrielectricity is well known in\nsmectic liquid crystals but almost unknown in true crystalline solids. Pulvari\nreported it in 1960 in mixtures of ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, but\nonly at high fields. TSCC exhibits a second-order displacive phase transition\nnear Tc = 130 K that can be lowered to a Quantum Critical Point at zero Kelvin\nvia Br- or I-substitution, and phases predicted to be antiferroelectric at high\npressure and low temperatures. Unusually, the size of the primitive unit cell\ndoes not increase. We measure hysteresis loops and polarization below T = 64 K\nand clear Raman evidence for this transition, as well of another transition\nnear 47-50 K. X-ray and neutron studies below Tc = 130K show there is an\nantiferroelectric displacement out of plane of two sarcosine groups; but these\nare antiparallel displacements are of different magnitude, leading to a bias\nvoltage that grows with decreasing T. A monoclinic subgroup C2 may be possible\nat the lowest temperatures (T<64K or T<48K), but no direct evidence exists for\na crystal class lower than orthorhombic.\n", "  In the electronic measurement of the Boltzmann constant based on Johnson\nnoise thermometry, the ratio of the power spectral densities of thermal noise\nacross a resistor at the triple point of water, and pseudo-random noise\nsynthetically generated by a quantum-accurate voltage-noise source is constant\nto within 1 part in a billion for frequencies up to 1 GHz. Given this ratio,\nand the values of other known or measured parameters, one can determine the\nBoltzmann constant. Due, in part, to mismatch between transmission lines, the\nexperimental ratio spectrum varies with frequency. We model this spectrum as an\neven polynomial function of frequency where the constant term in the polynomial\ndetermines the Boltzmann constant. When determining this constant (offset) from\nexperimental data, the assumed complexity of the ratio spectrum model and the\nmaximum frequency analyzed (fitting bandwidth) dramatically affects results. We\nselect the complexity of the model by cross-validation. For each of many\nfitting bandwidths, we determine the component of uncertainty of the offset\nterm that accounts for random and systematic effects associated with imperfect\nknowledge of model complexity. We select the fitting bandwidth that minimizes\nthis uncertainty. In the most recent measurement of the Boltzmann constant,\nresults were determined, in part, by application of an earlier version of the\nmethod described here. Here, we extend the earlier analysis by considering a\nbroader range of fitting bandwidths and quantify an additional component of\nuncertainty that accounts for imperfect performance of our fitting bandwidth\nselection method. For idealized simulated data our method correctly selects the\ntrue complexity of the ratio spectrum model for all cases considered. A new\nanalysis of data from the recent experiment yields evidence for a temporal\ntrend in the offset parameters.\n", "  Inspired by practical importance of social networks, economic networks,\nbiological networks and so on, studies on large and complex networks have\nattracted a surge of attentions in the recent years. Link prediction is a\nfundamental issue to understand the mechanisms by which new links are added to\nthe networks. We introduce the method of robust principal component analysis\n(robust PCA) into link prediction, and estimate the missing entries of the\nadjacency matrix. On one hand, our algorithm is based on the sparsity and low\nrank property of the matrix, on the other hand, it also performs very well when\nthe network is dense. This is because a relatively dense real network is also\nsparse in comparison to the complete graph. According to extensive experiments\non real networks from disparate fields, when the target network is connected\nand sufficiently dense, whatever it is weighted or unweighted, our method is\ndemonstrated to be very effective and with prediction accuracy being\nconsiderably improved comparing with many state-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "  We study the behaviour of one-dimensional strongly dissipative systems\nsubject to a quasi-periodic force. In particular we are interested in the\nexistence of response solutions, that is quasi-periodic solutions having the\nsame frequency vector as the forcing term. Earlier results available in the\nliterature show that, when the dissipation is large enough and a suitable\nfunction involving the forcing has a simple zero, response solutions can be\nproved to exist and to be attractive provided some Diophantine condition is\nassumed on the frequency vector. In this paper we show that the results extend\nto the case of arbitrary frequency vectors.\n", "  Nonequilibrium processes occurring in functional materials can significantly\nimpact device efficiencies and are often difficult to characterize due to the\nbroad range of length and time scales involved. In particular, mixed halide\nhybrid perovskites are promising for optoelectronics, yet the halides\nreversibly phase separate when photo-excited, significantly altering device\nperformance. By combining nanoscale imaging and multiscale modeling, we\nelucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, demonstrating that local\nstrain induced by photo-generated polarons promotes halide phase separation and\nleads to nucleation of light-stabilized iodide-rich clusters. This effect\nrelies on the unique electromechanical properties of hybrid materials,\ncharacteristic of neither their organic nor inorganic constituents alone.\nExploiting photo-induced phase separation and other nonequilibrium phenomena in\nhybrid materials, generally, could enable new opportunities for expanding the\nfunctional applications in sensing, photoswitching, optical memory, and energy\nstorage.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to investigate the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio for a\nsample of AGB stars, containing M-, S- and C-type stars. These ratios are\nevaluated in relation to fundamental stellar evolution parameters: the stellar\ninitial mass and pulsation period. Circumstellar $^{13}$C$^{16}$O,\n$^{12}$C$^{17}$O and $^{12}$C$^{18}$O line observations were obtained for a\nsample of nine stars with various single-dish long-wavelength facilities. Line\nintensity ratios are shown to relate directly to the surface $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O\nabundance ratio. Stellar evolution models predict the $^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio\nto be a sensitive function of initial mass and to remain constant throughout\nthe entire TP-AGB phase for stars initially less massive than 5\\,$M_{\\odot}$.\nThis makes the measured ratio a probe of the initial stellar mass. Observed\n$^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratios are found to be well in the range predicted by stellar\nevolution models that do not consider convective overshooting. From this,\naccurate initial mass estimates are calculated for seven sources. For the\nremaining two sources two mass solutions result, though with a larger\nprobability that the low-mass solution is the correct one. Finally, hints at a\npossible separation between M/S- and C-type stars when comparing the\n$^{17}$O/$^{18}$O ratio to the stellar pulsation period are presented.\n", "  Inspired by the recent measurements of the $\\eta_c$ meson production at LHC,\nwe investigate the relativistic correction effect for the fragmentation\nfunction of the gluon into $\\eta_c$, which constitutes the crucial\nnonperturbative elements to understand $\\eta_c$ production at high $p_T$.\nEmploying three distinct methods, we calculate the leading relativistic\ncorrection to the $g\\to\\eta_c$ fragmentation function in the NRQCD\nfactorization framework, as well as verify the existing NLO result for the\n$c\\to \\eta_c$ fragmentation function. We also study the evolution behavior of\nthese fragmentation functions with the aid of DGLAP equation.\n", "  In this letter we present an analytic method for calculating the transition\nprobability between two random Gaussian matrices with given eigenvalue spectra\nin the context of Dyson Brownian motion. We show that in the Coulomb gas\nlanguage, in large $N$ limit, memory of the initial state is preserved in the\nform of a universal linear potential acting on the eigenvalues. We compute the\nlikelihood of any given transition as a function of time, showing that as\nmemory of the initial state is lost, transition probabilities converge to those\nof the static ensemble.\n", "  We give a short compendium of the main ongoing detectors and concepts capable\nof performing accurate sub-100 ps timing at high particle fluxes and on large\nareas, through technologies based on gaseous media. We briefly discuss the\nstate-of-the-art, technological limitations and prospects, and a new bizarre\nidea.\n", "  Different versions of the notion of a state have been formulated for various\nso-called quantum structures. In this paper, we investigate the interplay among\nstates on synaptic algebras and on its sub-structures. A synaptic algebra is a\ngeneralization of the partially ordered Jordan algebra of all bounded\nself-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. The paper culminates with a\ncharacterization of extremal states on a commutative generalized Hermitian\nalgebra, a special kind of synaptic algebra.\n", "  Quantum mechanics postulates random outcomes. However, a model making the\nsame output predictions but in a deterministic manner would be, in principle,\nexperimentally indistinguishable from quantum theory. In this work we consider\nsuch models in the context of non-locality on a device independent scenario.\nThat is, we study pairs of non-local boxes that produce their outputs\ndeterministically. It is known that, for these boxes to be non-local, at least\none of the boxes' output has to depend on the other party's input via some kind\nof hidden signaling. We prove that, if the deterministic mechanism is also\nalgorithmic, there is a protocol which, with the sole knowledge of any upper\nbound on the time complexity of such algorithm, extracts that hidden signaling\nand uses it for the communication of information.\n", "  Soft X-rays (90-173 eV) from the 3rd generation Canadian Light Source have\nbeen used in conjunction with a multi coincidence time and position sensitive\ndetection apparatus to observe the dissociative ionization of OCS. By varying\nthe X-ray energy we can compare dynamics from direct and Auger ionization\nprocesses, and access ionization channels which result in two or three body\nbreakup, from 2+ to 4+ ionization states. We make several new observations for\nthe 3+ state such as kinetic energy release limited by photon energy, and using\nDalitz plots we can see evidence of timescale effects between the direct and\nAuger ionization process for the first time. Finally, using Dalitz plots for\nOCS$^{4+}$ we observe for the first time that breakup involving an O$^{2+}$ ion\ncan only proceed from out of equilibrium nuclear arrangement for S(2p) Auger\nionization.\n", "  A model linking the molecular-scale dynamics of fluids confined to nano-pores\nto nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rates is proposed. The model is\nfit to experimental NMR dispersions for water and oil in an oil shale assuming\nthat each fluid is characterised by three time constants and L\\'{e}vy\nstatistics. Results yield meaningful and consistent intra-pore dynamical time\nconstants, insight into diffusion mechanisms and pore morphology. The model is\napplicable to a wide range of porous systems and advances NMR dispersion as a\npowerful tool for measuring nano-porous fluid properties.\n", "  In this paper we develop perturbation theory on the reduced space of a\nprincipal $G-$bundle. This theory uses a multiscale method and is related to\nvibrodynamics. For a fast oscillating motion with the symmetry Lie group $G$,\nwe prove that the averaged equation (i.e. the equation describing the slow\nmotion) is the Euler equation on the dual of a certain central extension of the\ncorresponding Lie algebra $\\mathfrak g$. As an application of this theory we\nstudy the Craik--Leibovich (CL) equation in hydrodynamics. We show that CL\nequation can be regarded as the Euler equation on the dual of an appropriate\ncentral extension of the Lie algebra of divergence-free vector fields. From\nthis geometric point of view, one can give a generalization of CL equation on\nany Riemannian manifold with boundary. For accuracy of the averaged equation,\nwe prove that the difference between the solution of the averaged equation and\nthe solution of the perturbed equation remains small (of order $\\epsilon$) over\na very long time interval (of order $1/{\\epsilon^2}$). Combining the geometric\nstructure of the generalized CL equation and the averaging theorem, we present\na large class of adiabatic invariants for the perturbation model of the\nLangmuir circulation in the ocean.\n", "  With the help of the Berry curvature and the first Chern number\n$($$\\textit{C}_1$$)$, we both analytically and numerically investigate and thus\nsimulate artificial magnetic monopoles formed in parameter space of the\nHamiltonian of a driven superconducting qubit. The topological structure of a\nspin-1/2 system $($qubit$)$ can be captured by the distribution of Berry\ncurvature, which describes the geometry of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.\nDegeneracy points in parameter space act as sources $($$\\textit{C}_1$ = $1$$)$\nor sinks $($$\\textit{C}_1$ = $-1$$)$ of the magnetic field. We note that the\nstrength of the magnetic field $($described by Berry curvature$)$ has an\napparent impact on the quantum states during the process of topological\ntransition. It exhibits an unusual property that the transition of the quantum\nstates is asymmetric when the degenerate point passes from outside to inside\nand again outside the manifold spanned by system parameters. Our results also\npave the way to explore intriguing properties of magnetic monopoles in other\nspin-1/2 systems.\n", "  Recent experiments (G. Ariel, et al., Nature Comm. 6, 8396 (2015)) revealed\nan intriguing behavior of swarming bacteria: they fundamentally change their\ncollective motion from simple diffusion into a superdiffusive L\\'{e}vy walk\ndynamics. We introduce a nonlinear non-Markovian persistent random walk model\nthat explains the emergence of superdiffusive L\\'{e}vy walks. We show that the\nalignment interaction between individuals can lead to the superdiffusive growth\nof the mean squared displacement and the power law distribution of run length\nwith infinite variance. The main result is that the superdiffusive behavior\nemerges as a nonlinear collective phenomenon, rather than due to the standard\nassumption of the power law distribution of run distances from the inception.\nAt the same time, we find that the repulsion/collision effects lead to the\ndensity dependent exponential tempering of power law distributions. This\nqualitatively explains experimentally observed transition from superdiffusion\nto the diffusion of mussels as their density increases (M. de Jager et al.,\nProc. R. Soc. B 281, 20132605 (2014)).\n", "  In this paper, we study some aspects of energy loss in non-relativistic\ntheories from holography. We analyze the energy lost by a rotating heavy point\nparticle along a circle of radius $l$ with angular velocity $\\omega$ in\ntheories with general dynamical exponent $z$ and hyperscaling violation\nexponent $\\theta$. It is shown that this problem provides a novel perspective\non the energy loss in such theories. A general computation at zero and finite\ntemperature is done and it is shown that how the total energy loss rate depends\nnon-trivially on two characteristic exponents $(z,\\theta)$. We find that at\nzero temperature there is a special radius $l_c$ where the energy loss is\nindependent of different values of $(\\theta,z)$. Also at zero temperature,\nthere is a crossover between a regime in which the energy loss is dominated by\nthe linear drag force and by the radiation because of the acceleration of the\nrotating particle. We find that the energy loss of the particle decreases by\nincreasing $\\theta$ and $z$. We note that, unlike in the zero temperature,\nthere is no special radius $l_c$ at finite temperature case.\n", "  We study suspensions of oblate rigid particles in a viscous fluid for\ndifferent values of the particle volume fractions. Direct numerical simulations\nhave been performed using a direct-forcing immersed boundary method to account\nfor the dispersed phase, combined with a soft-sphere collision model and\nlubrication corrections for short-range particle-particle and particle-wall\ninteractions. With respect to the single phase flow, we show that in flows\nladen with oblate spheroids the drag is reduced and the turbulent fluctuations\nattenuated. In particular, the turbulence activity decreases to lower values\nthan those obtained by only accounting for the effective suspension viscosity.\nTo explain the observed drag reduction we consider the particle dynamics and\nthe interactions of the particles with the turbulent velocity field and show\nthat the particle wall layer, previously observed and found to be responsible\nfor the increased dissipation in suspensions of spheres, disappears in the case\nof oblate particles. These rotate significantly slower than spheres near the\nwall and tend to stay with their major axes parallel to the wall, which leads\nto a decrease of the Reynolds stresses and turbulence production and so to the\noverall drag reduction.\n", "  We propose a concept of chiral photonic limiters utilising topologically\nprotected localised midgap defect states in a photonic waveguide. The chiral\nsymmetry alleviates the effects of structural imperfections and guaranties a\nhigh level of resonant transmission for low intensity radiation. At high\nintensity, the light-induced absorption can suppress the localised modes, along\nwith the resonant transmission. In this case the entire photonic structure\nbecomes highly reflective within a broad frequency range, thus increasing\ndramatically the damage threshold of the limiter. Here we demonstrate\nexperimentally the principle of operation of such photonic structures using a\nwaveguide consisting of coupled dielectric microwave resonators.\n", "  Superconducting iron chalcogenide FeSe has the simplest crystal structure\namong all the Fe-based superconductors. Unlike other iron pnictides, FeSe\nexhibits no long range magnetic order accompanying the\ntetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural distortion, which raises the fundamental\nquestion about the role of magnetism and its associated spin fluctuations in\nmediating both nematicity and superconductivity. The extreme sensitivity of\nFeSe to external pressure suggests that chemical pressure, induced by\nsubstitution of Se by the smaller ion S, could also a be good tuning parameter\nto further study the coupling between superconductivity and nematicity and to\nobtain information on both the Fermi-surface changes and the symmetry of the\nsuperconducting state. Here we study the thermodynamic properties of\nFe(Se$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$) for 3 compositions, $x=0$, 0.08 and 0.15, using\nheat-capacity and thermal-expansion measurements. With increasing S content we\nobserve a significant reduction of the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition\ntemperature T$_{s}$. However, this suppression of T$_{s}$ is counterintuitively\naccompanied by an enhancement of the orthorhombic distortion $\\delta$ below\nT$_c$, which clearly indicates that superconductivity favors the nematic state.\nIn parallel, the superconducting transition temperature T$_{c}$ is sizeably\nenhanced, whereas the increase of the Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma_{n}$ is\nquite moderate. In the T$\\to$ 0 limit, an unusually large residual density of\nstates is found for $x>0$ indicative of significant substitution-induced\ndisorder. We discuss these observations in the context of $s+d$\nsuperconducting-state symmetry.\n", "  We manipulate correlations between Rydberg excitations in cold atom samples\nusing a rotary-echo technique. The correlations are due to interactions between\nthe Rydberg atoms. In the rotary-echo excitation sequence, the phase of the\nexcitation pulse is flipped at a selected time during the pulse. We measure the\nresultant change in the spatial pair correlation function of the excitations\nvia direct position-sensitive atom imaging. For zero detuning of the lasers\nfrom the interaction-free Rydberg-excitation resonance, the pair-correlation\nvalue at the most likely nearest-neighbor Rydberg-atom distance is\nsubstantially enhanced when the phase is flipped at the middle of the\nexcitation pulse. In this case, the rotary echo eliminates most uncorrelated\n(un-paired) atoms, leaving an abundance of correlated atom pairs at the end of\nthe sequence. In off-resonant cases, a complementary behavior is observed. We\nfurther characterize the effect of the rotary-echo excitation sequence on the\nexcitation-number statistics of the atom sample.\n", "  If one modifies the Dirac equation in momentum space to\n$[\\gamma^{\\mu}p_{\\mu}-m-\\Delta m(\\theta(p_{0})-\\theta(-p_{0}))\n\\theta(p_{\\mu}^{2})]\\psi(p)=0$, the symmetry of positive and negative energy\neigenvalues is lifted by $m\\pm \\Delta m$ for a small $\\Delta m$. The mass\ndegeneracy of the particle and antiparticle is thus lifted in a Lorentz\ninvariant manner since the combinations $\\theta(\\pm p_{0})\\theta(p_{\\mu}^{2})$\nwith step functions are manifestly Lorentz invariant. We explain an explicit\nconstruction of this CPT breaking term in coordinate space, which is Lorentz\ninvariant but non-local at a distance scale of the Planck length. The\napplication of this Lorentz invariant CPT breaking mechanism to the possible\nmass splitting of the neutrino and antineutrino in the Standard Model is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  We propose and implement a simple and compact quantum random number\ngeneration (QRNG) scheme based on the quantum phase fluctuations of a DFB\nlaser. The distribution probability of the experimentally measured data fits\nwell with the simulation result, got from the theoretical model we established.\nMin-entropy estimation and Toeplitz-hashing randomness extractor are used to\nobtain the final random bit. The proposed approach has advantages not only in\nsimple structure but also in high random bit generation rate. As a result, 502\nGbits/s random bits generation speed can be obtained, which is much higher than\nprevious similar schemes. This approach offers a possibility to promote the\npractical application of QRNG.\n", "  We generalize a recent method for computing optimal 2D convection cooling\nflows in a horizontal layer to a wide range of geometries, including those\nrelevant for technological applications. We write the problem in a conformal\npair of coordinates which are the pure conduction temperature and its harmonic\nconjugate. We find optimal flows for cooling a cylinder in an annular domain, a\nhot plate embedded in a cold surface, and a channel with hot interior and cold\nexterior. With a constraint of fixed kinetic energy, the optimal flows are all\nessentially the same in the conformal coordinates. In the physical coordinates,\nthey consist of vortices ranging in size from the length of the hot surface to\na small cutoff length at the interface of the hot and cold surfaces. With the\nconstraint of fixed enstrophy (or fixed rate of viscous dissipation), a\ngeometry-dependent metric factor appears in the equations. The conformal\ncoordinates are useful here because they map the problems to a rectangular\ndomain, facilitating numerical solutions. With a small enstrophy budget, the\noptimal flows are dominated by vortices which have the same size as the flow\ndomain.\n", "  The linear stability threshold of the Rayleigh-Benard configuration is\nanalyzed with compressible effects taken into account. It is assumed that the\nfluid obeys a Newtonian rheology and Fourier's law of thermal transport with\nconstant, uniform (dynamic) viscosity and thermal conductivity in a uniform\ngravity field. Top and bottom boundaries are maintained at different constant\ntemperatures and we consider here boundary conditions of zero tangential stress\nand impermeable walls. Under these conditions, and with the Boussinesq\napproximation, Rayleigh (1916) first obtained analytically the critical value\n27pi^4/4 for a dimensionless parameter, now known as the Rayleigh number, at\nthe onset of convection. This manuscript describes the changes of the critical\nRayleigh number due to the compressibility of the fluid, measured by the\ndimensionless dissipation parameter D and due to a finite temperature\ndifference between the hot and cold boundaries, measured by a dimensionless\ntemperature gradient a. Different equations of state are examined: ideal gas\nequation, Murnaghan's model and a generic equation of state, which can\nrepresent any possible equation of state. We also consider two variations of\nthis stability analysis. In a so-called quasi-Boussinesq model, we consider\nthat density perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In a\nso-called quasi-anelastic liquid approximation, we consider that entropy\nperturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In addition to the\nnumerical Chebyshev-based stability analysis, an analytical approximation is\nobtained when temperature fluctuations are written as a combination of only two\nmodes. This analytical expression allows us to show that the superadiabatic\ncritical Rayleigh number quadratic departure in a and D from 27pi^4/4 involves\nthe expansion of density up to the degree three in terms of pressure and\ntemperature.\n", "  We compute in this short note the OPE coefficient of two 20' operators and\nthe Konishi. We use the OPE decomposition of a four point function of four 20'\noperators and the method of asymptotic expansions to compute the integrals at\nthe order that it is needed.\n", "  In this paper, we derive the large deviations principle for the Potts model\non the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ as $n$ increases to infinity. Next,\nfor the Potts model on $K_{n,n}$, we provide an extension of the method of\naggregate path coupling that was originally developed in Kovchegov et al 2011\nfor the mean-field Blume-Capel model and in Kovchegov and Otto 2015 for a\ngeneral mean-field setting that included the Generalized Curie-Weiss-Potts\nmodel analyzed in Cuff et al 2012. We use the aggregate path coupling method to\nidentify and prove the interface value $\\beta_s$ separating the rapid and slow\nmixing regimes for the Glauber dynamics of the Potts model on $K_{n,n}$.\n", "  Using the analytical expressions for the genuine eigenfunctions\n$\\varphi_{\\mu\\nu}(z)$ and eigenvalues $E_{\\mu,\\nu}$, of open, bounded and\nquasi-bounded finite periodic systems, we derive the eigenfunctions\nspace-inversion symmetry relations. The superlattice eigenfunctions symmetries,\nclosely related with the symmetries and zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials of\nthe second kind $U_n$, are fully written in terms of the number of unit cells\n$n$, the subband index $\\mu$ and the intra-subband index $\\nu$.\n", "  Witten's twistor string theory has led to new representations of S-matrix in\nmassless QFT as a single object, including Cachazo-He-Yuan formulas in general\nand connected formulas in four dimensions. As a first step towards more\nrealistic processes of the standard model, we extend the construction to QCD\ntree amplitudes with massless quarks and those with a Higgs boson. For both\ncases, we find connected formulas in four dimensions for all multiplicities\nwhich are very similar to the one for Yang-Mills amplitudes. The formula for\nquark-gluon color-ordered amplitudes differs from the pure-gluon case only by a\nJacobian factor that depends on flavors and orderings of the quarks. In the\nformula for Higgs plus multi-parton amplitudes, the massive Higgs boson is\neffectively described by two additional massless legs which do not appear in\nthe Parke-Taylor factor. The latter also represents the first\ntwistor-string/connected formula for form factors.\n", "  A principle of an acoustic Eaton Lens array and its application as a\nremovable tsunami wall is proposed theoretically. The lenses are made of\nexpandable rubber pillars or balloons and create a stop-band by the rotating\nthe incoming tsunami wave and reduce the pressure by canceling each other. The\ndiameter of each lens is larger than the wavelength of the tsunami near the\ncoast, that is, order of a kilometer. The impedance matching on the border of\nthe lenses results in little reflection. Before a tsunami, the balloons are\nburied underground in shallow water near the coast in folded or rounded form.\nUpon sounding of the tsunami alarm, water and air are pumped into the pillars,\nwhich expand and erect the wall above the sea level within a few hours. After\nthe tsunami, the water and air are released from the pillars, which are then\nburied underground for reuse. Electricity is used to power the entire process.\nA numerical simulation with a linear tsunami model was carried out.\n", "  We show that Weyl points with topological charges 1 and 2 can be found in\nvery simple chiral woodpile photonic crystals, which can be fabricated using\ncurrent techniques down to the nano-scale. The sign of the topological charges\ncan be tuned by changing the material parameters of the crystal, keeping the\nstructure and the symmetry unchanged. The underlying physics can be understood\nusing a tight binding model, which shows that the sign of the charge depends on\nthe hopping range. Gapless surface states and their back-scattering immune\nproperties are also demonstrated in these systems.\n", "  Bare reverse biased silicon photodiodes were exposed to 3eV He+, Ne+, Ar+,\nN2+, N+ and H2O+ ions. In all cases an increase of the reverse current through\nthe diode was observed. This effect and its dependence on the ionization energy\nof the incident ions and on other factors are qualitatively explained in the\nframework of Auger-type surface neutralization theory. Amplification of the\nion-induced charge was observed with an avalanche photodiode under high applied\nbias. The observed effect can be considered as ion-induced internal potential\nelectron emission into the conduction band of silicon. To the best of our\nknowledge, no experimental evidence of such effect was previously reported.\nPossible applications are discussed.\n", "  We present a hydrodynamic theory to describe shear flows in developing\nepithelial tissues. We introduce hydrodynamic fields corresponding to state\nproperties of constituent cells as well as a contribution to overall tissue\nshear flow due to rearrangements in cell network topology. We then construct a\ngeneric linear constitutive equation for the shear rate due to topological\nrearrangements and we investigate a novel rheological behaviour resulting from\nmemory effects in the tissue. We identify two distinct active cellular\nprocesses: generation of active stress in the tissue, and actively driven\ntopological rearrangements. We find that these two active processes can produce\ndistinct cellular and tissue shape changes, depending on boundary conditions\napplied on the tissue. Our findings have consequences for the understanding of\ntissue morphogenesis during development.\n", "  The effective interaction between two planar walls immersed in a fluid is\ninvestigated by use of Density Functional Theory in the super-critical region\nof the phase diagram. A hard core Yukawa model of fluid is studied with special\nattention to the critical region. To achieve this goal a new formulation of the\nWeighted Density Approximation coupled with the Hierarchical Reference Theory,\nable to deal with critical long wavelength fluctuations, is put forward and\ncompared with other approaches. The effective interaction between the walls is\nseen to change character on lowering the temperature: The strong oscillations\ninduced by layering of the molecules, typical of the depletion mechanism in\nhard core systems, are gradually smoothed and, close to the critical point, a\nlong range attractive tail emerges leading to a scaling form which agrees with\nthe expectations based on the critical Casimir effect. Strong corrections to\nscaling are seen to affect the results up to very small reduced temperatures.\nBy use of Derjaguin approximation, this investigation has natural implications\nfor the aggregation of colloidal particles in critical solvents.\n", "  Gauged $U(1)_{L_\\mu - L_\\tau}$ model has been advocated for a long time in\nlight of muon $g-2$ anomaly, which is a more than $3\\sigma$ discrepancy between\nthe experimental measurement and the standard model prediction. We augment this\nmodel with three right-handed neutrinos $(N_e, N_\\mu, N_\\tau)$ and a\nvector-like singlet fermion $(\\chi)$ to explain simultaneously the non-zero\nneutrino mass and dark matter content of the Universe, while satisfying\nanomalous muon $g-2$ constraints. It is shown that in a large parameter space\nof this model we can explain positron excess, observed at PAMELA, Fermi-LAT and\nAMS-02, through dark matter annihilation, while satisfying the relic density\nand direct detection constraints.\n", "  Using a nonlinear sound wave equation for a bubbly liquid in conjunction with\nan equation for bubble pulsation, we predict and experimentally demonstrate the\nappearance of a gap in the frequency spectrum of a sound wave propagating in a\ncavitation cloud comprising bubbles. For bubbles with an ambient radius of 100\n{\\mu}m, the calculations revealed that this gap corresponds to the phenomenon\nof sound wave localization. For bubbles with an ambient radius of 120 {\\mu}m,\nthis spectral gap relates to a forbidden band of the sound wave. In the\nexperiment, we observed the predicted gap in the frequency spectrum in soda\nwater; however, in tap water, no spectral gap was present because the bubbles\nwere much smaller than 100 {\\mu}m.\n", "  We employ a collective vibration coupled-channel model to describe the\nnucleon-16O cluster systems, obtaining low-excitation spectra for 17O and 17F.\nBound and resonance states of the compound systems have been deduced, showing\ngood agreement with experimental spectra. Low energy scattering cross sections\nof neutrons and protons from 16O also have been calculated and the results\ncompare well with available experimental data.\n", "  FOXTAIL is a new hybrid magnetohydrodynamic-kinetic code used to describe\ninteractions between energetic particles and Alfv\\'en eigenmodes in tokamaks\nwith realistic geometries. The code simulates the nonlinear dynamics of the\namplitudes of individual eigenmodes and of a set of discrete markers in\nfive-dimensional phase space representing the energetic particle distribution.\nAction-angle coordinates of the equilibrium system are used for efficient\ntracing of energetic particles, and the particle acceleration by the wave\nfields of the eigenmodes is Fourier decomposed in the same angles. The\neigenmodes are described using temporally constant eigenfunctions with dynamic\ncomplex amplitudes. Possible applications of the code are presented, e.g.,\nmaking a quantitative validity evaluation of the one-dimensional bump-on-tail\napproximation of the system. Expected effects of the fulfillment of the\nChirikov criterion in two-mode scenarios have also been verified.\n", "  Generalized theory of the normal properties of the metal in the case of the\nelectron-phonon (EP) systems with not constant density of electronic states is\nused to examine the normal state of the SH3 and SH2 phase of the hydrogen\nsulfide at different pressures. The frequency dependence of the real and\nimaginary part of the self-energy part (SP) of the electron Green's function,\nthe real and imaginary part of the complex renormalization of the electron\nmass, the real and imaginary part of the complex renormalization of the\nchemical potential, as well as the renormalized with the strong electron-phonon\ninteraction the electron density of states are calculated. The calculations are\nperformed for the stable orthorhombic IM-3M hydrogen sulfide SH3 structure at\nthree pressures P = 170 GPa, P = 180 GPa, P = 225 GPa and SH2 structure with\nthe symmetry I4/MMM (D4H-17) for the three values of pressure P = 150 GPa , P =\n180 GPa, P = 225 GPa at the temperature of T = 200K. Key words: hydrogen\nsulfide, electron-phonon system, the pressure, the electronic properties.\n", "  Although the roll/streak structure is ubiquitous in pre-transitional\nwall-bounded shear flow, this structure is linearly stable if the idealization\nof laminar flow is made. Lacking an instability, the large transient growth of\nthe roll/streak structure has been invoked to explain its appearance as\nresulting from chance occurrence in the free-stream turbulence (FST) of\nperturbations configured to optimally excite it. However, there is an\nalternative interpretation which is that FST interacts with the roll/streak\nstructure to destabilize it. Statistical state dynamics (SSD) provides analysis\nmethods for studying instabilities of this type which arise from interaction\nbetween the coherent and incoherent components of turbulence. Stochastic\nstructural stability theory (S3T), which implements SSD in the form of a\nclosure at second order, is used to analyze the SSD modes arising from\ninteraction between the coherent streamwise invariant component and the\nincoherent FST component of turbulence. The least stable S3T mode is\ndestabilized at a critical value of a parameter controlling FST intensity and a\nfinite amplitude roll/streak structure arises from this instability through a\nbifurcation in this parameter. Although this bifurcation has analytical\nexpression only in SSD, it is closely reflected in both the dynamically similar\nquasi-linear system, referred to as the restricted non-linear (RNL) system, and\nin DNS. S3T also predicts a second bifurcation at a higher value of the\nturbulent excitation parameter. This second bifurcation is shown to lead to\ntransition to turbulence. Bifurcation from a finite amplitude roll/streak\nequilibrium provides a direct route to the turbulent state through the S3T\nroll/streak instability.\n", "  We modify the first laws of thermodynamics of a Reissner-Nordstrom anti-de\nSitter black hole and a pure de Sitter space-time by the surface tensions. The\ncorresponding Smarr relations are obeyed. The cosmological constants are first\ntreated as fixed constants, and then as variables associated to the pressures.\nFor the black hole, the law is written as $\\delta E = T \\delta S - \\sigma\\delta\nA$ when the cosmological constant is fixed, where $E$ is the Misner-Sharp mass\nand $\\sigma$ is the surface tension. Adopting the varied constant, we modify\nthe law as $\\delta E_0 = T \\delta S - \\sigma_{eff}\\delta A +V\\delta P$, where\n$E_0=M-\\frac{Q^2}{2r_+}$ is the enthalpy. The thermodynamical properties are\ninvestigated. For the de Sitter space-time, the expressions of the modified\nlaws are different from these of the black hole. The differential way to derive\nthe law is discussed.\n", "  Scintillation properties of the new Tl2LaCl5: xCe3+ where x = 0, 0.5, 1 and\n10 mole % (TLC: Ce3+) single crystals are presented. Two zones vertical\nBridgman technique is used for the growth of this scintillation material. High\nZ-number (79) of this material offer excellent detection efficiency for X- and\n{\\gamma}-rays. Grown samples are characterized under X- and {\\gamma}-rays\nexcitation in order to find the emission wavelength, energy resolution, light\nyield, and decay time. Emission spectra exhibit Ce3+ emission bands between 350\n- 550 nm and peaking at 389 nm. The obtained energy resolution and light yield\nincreases with high Ce-concentration. Energy resolution and light yield of\n10%Ce-doped sample are found to be 6.9% (FWHM) and 51,000+-5000 ph/MeV,\nrespectively at room temperature. For the grown samples, two exponential decay\ntime constants are found. The measured decay time constants showed variation in\ntheir values with respect to Ce-concentrations in the host crystal. Fast decay\ntime constant of 31 ns with 87% light emission is found for 10%Ce sample.\nScintillation results suggested that TLC will be one of the promising next\ngeneration scintillator for the medical imaging techniques such as Positron\nEmission Tomography (PET).\n", "  Tunneling amplitude through magnetic breakdown (MB) gap is considered for two\nbands Fermi surfaces illustrated in many organic metals. In particular, the\nS-matrix associated to the wave-function transmission through the MB gap for\nthe relevant class of differential equations is the main object allowing the\ndetermination of tunneling probabilities and phases. The calculated\ntransmission coefficients include a field-dependent Onsager phase. As a result,\nquantum oscillations are not periodic in 1/B for finite magnetic breakdown gap.\nExact and approximate methods are proposed for computing ratio amplitudes of\nthe wave-function in interacting two-band models.\n", "  We analyzed the noncommutativity effects on the Fisher information (F_(r,p))\nand Shannon entropies (S_(r,p)) of a harmonic oscillator immersed in a\ntime-varying electric field in two and three dimensions. We find the exact\nsolutions of the respective time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation and use them\nto calculate the Fisher information and the Shannon entropy for the simplest\ncase corresponding the lowest-lying state of each system. While there is no\nproblem in defining the Shannon entropy for noncommutating spaces, the\ndefinition of the Fisher information had to be modified to satisfy the\nCramer-Rao inequalities. We observe for both systems, how the Fisher\ninformation and Shannon entropy in position and momentum change due to the\nnoncommutativity of the space. We verified that the Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski\n(BBM) entropic uncertainty relation still holds in the systems considered.\n", "  We construct a scheme for self-replicating square clusters of particles in\ntwo spatial dimensions, and validate it with computer simulations in a\nfinite-temperature heat bath. We find that the self-replication reactions\npropagate through the bath in the form of Fisher waves. Our model reflects\nexisting colloidal systems, but is simple enough to allow simulation of many\ngenerations and thereby the first study of evolutionary dynamics in an\nartificial system. By introducing spatially localized mutations in the\nreplication rules, we show that the mutated cluster population can survive and\nspread with the expanding front in circular sectors of the colony.\n", "  We use both continuum and lattice models to study the energy-momentum\ndispersion and the dynamics of a wave packet for an electron moving in graphene\nin the presence of spin-orbit couplings and either a single potential barrier\nor a periodic array of potential barriers. Both Kane-Mele and Rashba spin-orbit\ncouplings are considered. A number of special things occur when the Kane-Mele\nand Rashba couplings are equal in magnitude. In the absence of a potential, the\ndispersion then consists of both massless Dirac and massive Dirac states. A\nperiodic potential is known to generate additional Dirac points; we show that\nspin-orbit couplings generally open gaps at all those points, but if the two\nspin-orbit couplings are equal, some of the Dirac points remain gapless. We\nshow that the massless and massive states respond differently to a potential\nbarrier; the massless states transmit perfectly through the barrier at normal\nincidence while the massive states reflect from it. In the presence of a single\npotential barrier, we show that there are states localized along the barrier.\nFinally, we study the time evolution of a wave packet in the presence of a\nperiodic potential. We discover special points in momentum space where there is\nalmost no spreading of a wave packet; there are six such points in graphene\nwhen the spin-orbit couplings are absent.\n", "  We explore connections between two common methods for quantifying the\nuncertainty in parton distribution functions (PDFs), based on the Hessian error\nmatrix and Monte-Carlo sampling. CT14 parton distributions in the Hessian\nrepresentation are converted into Monte-Carlo replicas by a numerical method\nthat reproduces important properties of CT14 Hessian PDFs: the asymmetry of\nCT14 uncertainties and positivity of individual parton distributions. The\nensembles of CT14 Monte-Carlo replicas constructed this way at NNLO and NLO are\nsuitable for various collider applications, such as cross section reweighting.\nMaster formulas for computation of asymmetric standard deviations in the\nMonte-Carlo representation are derived. A correction is proposed to address a\nbias in asymmetric uncertainties introduced by the Taylor series approximation.\nA numerical program is made available for conversion of Hessian PDFs into\nMonte-Carlo replicas according to normal, log-normal, and Watt-Thorne sampling\nprocedures.\n", "  We report the detection of morphology dependent stellar age in massive\nquenched galaxies (QGs) at z~1.2. The sense of the dependence is that compact\nQGs are 0.5-2 Gyr older than normal-sized ones. The evidence comes from three\ndifferent age indicators, Dn4000, Hdelta and fits to spectral synthesis models,\napplied to their stacked optical spectra. All age indicators consistently show\nthat the stellar populations of compact QGs are older than their normally-sized\ncounterparts. We detect weak [OII] emission in a fraction of QGs, and the\nstrength of the line, when present, is similar between the two samples;\nhowever, compact galaxies exhibit significantly lower frequency of [OII]\nemission than normal ones. A fraction of both samples are individually detected\nin 7 Ms Chandra X-ray images (luminosities$\\sim10^{40}$-$10^{41}$ erg/sec). 7\nMs stacks of non-detected galaxies show similarly low luminosities in the soft\nband only, consistent with a hot gas origin for the X-ray emission. While both\n[OII] emitters and non-emitters are also X-ray sources among normal galaxies,\nno compact galaxy with [OII] emission is an X-ray source, arguing against an\nAGN powering the line in compact galaxies. We interpret the [OII] properties as\nfurther evidence that compact galaxies are older and further along into the\nprocess of quenching star-formation and suppressing gas accretion. Finally, we\nargue that the older age of compact QGs is evidence of progenitor bias: compact\nQGs simply reflect the smaller sizes of galaxies at their earlier quenching\nepoch, with stellar density most likely having nothing directly to do with\ncessation of star-formation.\n", "  We focus on the massive gauge theory formulation of axion monodromy\ninflation. We argue that a gauge symmetry hidden in these models is the key\nprotection mechanism from dangerous corrections from both field theory and\ngravitational dynamics. The effective theory of large field inflation is a dual\nto a massive U(1) 4-form gauge theory, which is similar to a massive gauge\ntheory description of superconductivity. The gauge theory explicitly realizes\nthe old Julia-Toulouse proposal for a low energy description of a gauge theory\nin a defect condensate. While we work mostly with the example of quadratic\naxion potential induced by flux monodromy, we discuss how other types of\npotentials can arise from inclusion of gauge invariant corrections to the\ntheory.\n", "  Manipulate and control of spin wave and spin flip are crucial for future\ndevelopments of magnonic and spintronic devices. We present that the spin wave\nin hexagonal LuMnO3 single crystal can be selectively excited with laser\npolarization perpendicular to the c-axis of hexagonal LuMnO3 and photon energy\n~ 1.8 eV. The selective excitation of spin wave also suggests that the spin\nflip can be selectively controlled in hexagonal manganites. In addition, the\nphysical origin of spin wave correlated with spin flip in hexagonal manganites\nis discussed.\n", "  The Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation is studied assuming a directed network\nof coupled oscillators. The asymmetry makes the spectrum of the Laplacian\noperator complex, and it is ultimately responsible for the onset of a\ngeneralized class of topological instability, reminiscent of the Benjamin-Feir\ntype. The analysis is initially carried out for a specific class of networks,\ncharacterized by a circulant adjacency matrix. This allows us to delineate\nanalytically the domain in the parameter space for which the generalized\ninstability occurs. We then move forward to considering the family of non\nlinear oscillators coupled via a generic direct, though balanced, graph. The\ncharacteristics of the emerging patterns are discussed within a self-consistent\ntheoretical framework.\n", "  The first observation of the decay $\\eta_{c}(2S) \\to p \\bar p$ is reported\nusing proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n$3.0\\rm \\, fb^{-1}$ recorded by the LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies\nof 7 and 8 TeV. The $\\eta_{c}(2S)$ resonance is produced in the decay $B^{+}\n\\to [c\\bar c] K^{+}$. The product of branching fractions normalised to that for\nthe $J/\\psi$ intermediate state, ${\\cal R}_{\\eta_{c}(2S)}$, is measured to be\n\\begin{align*} {\\cal R}_{\\eta_{c}(2S)}\\equiv\\frac{{\\mathcal B}(B^{+} \\to\n\\eta_{c}(2S) K^{+}) \\times {\\mathcal B}(\\eta_{c}(2S) \\to p \\bar p)}{{\\mathcal\nB}(B^{+} \\to J/\\psi K^{+}) \\times {\\mathcal B}(J/\\psi\\to p \\bar p)} =~& (1.58\n\\pm 0.33 \\pm 0.09)\\times 10^{-2}, \\end{align*} where the first uncertainty is\nstatistical and the second systematic. No signals for the decays $B^{+} \\to\nX(3872) (\\to p \\bar p) K^{+}$ and $B^{+} \\to \\psi(3770) (\\to p \\bar p) K^{+}$\nare seen, and the 95\\% confidence level upper limits on their relative\nbranching ratios are % found to be ${\\cal R}_{X(3872)}<0.25\\times10^{-2}$ and\n${\\cal R}_{\\psi(3770))}<0.10$. In addition, the mass differences between the\n$\\eta_{c}(1S)$ and the $J/\\psi$ states, between the $\\eta_{c}(2S)$ and the\n$\\psi(2S)$ states, and the natural width of the $\\eta_{c}(1S)$ are measured as\n\\begin{align*} M_{J/\\psi} - M_{\\eta_{c}(1S)} =~& 110.2 \\pm 0.5 \\pm 0.9 \\rm \\,\nMeV, M_{\\psi(2S)} -M_{\\eta_{c}(2S)} =~ & 52.5 \\pm 1.7 \\pm 0.6 \\rm \\, MeV,\n\\Gamma_{\\eta_{c}(1S)} =~& 34.0 \\pm 1.9 \\pm 1.3 \\rm \\, MeV. \\end{align*}\n", "  Currently, radiobiology experiments using heavy ions at GANIL(Grand\nAccelerateur National d Ions Lourds) are conducted under the supervision of the\nCIMAP (Center for research on Ions, MAterials and Photonics). In this context,\na new beam monitoring equipment named DOSION has been developed. It allows to\nperform measurements of accurate fluence and dose maps in near real time for\neach biological sample irradiated. In this paper, we present the detection\nsystem, its design, performances, calibration protocol and measurements\nperformed during radiobiology experiments. This setup is currently available\nfor any radiobiology experiments if one wishes to correlate one s own sample\nanalysis to state of the art dosimetric references.\n", "  We present a generic system of three harmonic modes coupled parametrically\nwith a time-varying coupling modulated by a combination of two pump harmonics,\nand show how this system provides the minimal platform to realize nonreciprocal\ncouplings that can lead to gainless photon circulation, and phase-preserving or\nphase-sensitive directional amplification. Explicit frequency-dependent\ncalculations within this minimal paradigm highlight the separation of\namplification and directionality bandwidths, universal in such schemes. We also\nstudy the influence of counter-rotating interactions that can adversely affect\ndirectionality and associated bandwidth; we find that these effects can be\nmitigated by suitably designing the properties of the auxiliary mode that plays\nthe role of an engineered reservoir to the amplification mode space.\n", "  Due to the oscillatory singular stress field around a crack tip, interface\nfracture has some peculiar features. This paper is focused on two of them. One\ncan be reflected by a proposed paradox that geometrically similar structures\nwith interface cracks under similar loadings may have different failure\nbehaviors. The other one is that the existing fracture parameters of the\noscillatory singular stress field, such as a complex stress intensity factor,\nexhibit some non-objectivity because their phase angle depend on an arbitrarily\nchosen length. Two objective and independent fracture parameters are proposed\nwhich can fully characterize the stress field near the crack tip. One parameter\nrepresents the stress intensity with classical unit of stress intensity\nfactors. It is interesting to find that the loading mode can be characterized\nby a length as the other parameter, which can properly reflect the phase of the\nstress oscillation with respect to the distance to the crack tip. This is quite\ndifferent from other crack tip fields in which the loading mode is usually\nexpressed by a phase angle. The corresponding failure criterion for interface\ncracks does not include any arbitrarily chosen quantity, and therefore is\nconvenient for comparing and accumulating experimental results, even existing\nones.\n", "  We present theoretical predictions for the production of top-quark pairs with\nup to three jets at the next-to leading order in perturbative QCD. The relevant\ncalculations are performed with Sherpa and OpenLoops. To address the issue of\nscale choices and related uncertainties in the presence of multiple scales, we\ncompare results obtained with the standard scale HT/2 at fixed order and the\nMINLO procedure. Analyzing various cross sections and distributions for\ntt+0,1,2,3 jets at the 13 TeV LHC we find a remarkable overall agreement\nbetween fixed-order and MINLO results. The differences are typically below the\nrespective factor-two scale variations, suggesting that for all considered jet\nmultiplicities, missing higher-order effects should not exceed the ten percent\nlevel.\n", "  In this proceedings contribution we summarize and discuss results of Refs.\n\\cite{Grumiller:2013swa, Grumiller:2015vaa} in the light of recent developments\nin $\\textrm{AdS}_2$ holography \\cite{Maldacena:2016upp, Jensen:2016pah,\nEngelsoy:2016xyb}.\n", "  SmB6 is a strongly correlated mixed-valence Kondo insulator with a newly\ndiscovered surface state, proposed to be of non-trivial topological origin.\nHowever, the surface state dominates electrical conduction only below T* ~ 4 K\nlimiting its scientific investigation and device application. Here, we report\nthe enhancement of T * in SmB6 under the application of tensile strain. With\n0.7% tensile strain we report surface dominated conduction at up to a\ntemperature of 240 K, persisting even after the strain has been removed. This\ncan be explained in the framework of strain-tuned temporal and spatial\nfluctuations of f-electron configurations, which might be generally applied to\nother mixed-valence materials. We note that this amount of strain can be indued\nin epitaxial SmB6 films via substrate in potential device applications.\n", "  Optical fields with orbital angular momentum (OAM) interact with medium have\nmany remarkable properties with its unique azimuthal phase, showing many\npotential applications in high capacity information processing, high precision\nmeasurement etc. The dephasing mechanics of optical fields with OAM in an\ninterface between light and matter plays a vital role in many areas of physics.\nIn this work, we study the transverse azimuthal dephasing of OAM spin wave in a\nhot atomic gas via OAM storage. The transverse azimuthal phase difference\nbetween the control and probe beams is mapped onto the spin wave, which\nessentially results in dephasing of atomic spin wave. The dephasing of OAM spin\nwave can be controlled by the parameters of OAM topological charge and beam\nwaist. Our results are helpful for studying OAM light interaction with matter,\nmaybe hold a promise in OAM-based quantum information processing.\n", "  Bacterial migration through confined spaces is critical for several phenomena\nlike: biofilm formation, bacterial transport in soils, and bacterial therapy\nagainst cancer . In the present work, \\textit{E. coli} (strain K12-MG1655 WT)\nmotility was characterized by recording and analyzing individual bacterium\ntrajectories in a simulated quasi-2-dimensional porous medium. The porous\nmedium was simulated by enclosing, between slide and cover slip, a\nbacterial-culture sample mixed with uniform 2.98 $\\mu m$ spherical latex\nparticles. The porosity of the medium was controlled by changing the latex\nparticle concentration. By statistically analyzing trajectory parameters like:\ninstantaneous velocity and turn angle, as well as mean squared displacement, we\nwere able to quantify the effects that different latex particle concentrations\nhave upon bacterial motility. To better understand our results, bacterial\ntrajectories were simulated by means of a phenomenological random-walk model\n(developed ad hoc), and the simulated results were compared with the\nexperimental ones.\n", "  The quasi-one-dimensional rhombic array of the waveguides is considered. In\nthe nonlinear case the system of equations describing coupled waves in the\nwaveguides has the solutions that represent the superposition of the flat band\nmodes. The property of stability of these solutions is considered. It was found\nthat the flat band solution is unstable until the power threshold be attained.\n", "  A compact, remote controlled, cost efficient diagnostic station has been\ndeveloped to measure the charge, the profile and the emittance for low energy\nproton beams. It has been installed and tested in the proton beam line of the\nProject Prometheus at SANAEM of the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.\n", "  We report for the first time the intrinsically three-dimensional (3D)\ngeometry of the magnetic reconnection process induced by ballooning instability\nin a generalized Harris sheet. The spatial distribution and structure of the\nquasi-separatrix layers, as well as their temporal emergence and evolution,\nindicate that the associated magnetic reconnection can only occur in a 3D\ngeometry, which is irreducible to that of any two-dimensional reconnection\nprocess. Such a finding provides a new perspective to the long-standing\ncontroversy over the substorm onset problem, and elucidates the combined roles\nof reconnection and ballooning instabilities. It also connects to the universal\npresence of 3D reconnection processes previously discovered in various natural\nand laboratory plasmas.\n", "  In this paper we characterize the scaling of energy spectra, and the\ninterscale transfer of energy and enstrophy, for strongly, moderately and\nweakly stably stratified two-dimensional (2D) turbulence under large-scale\nrandom forcing. In the strongly stratified case, a large-scale vertically\nsheared horizontal flow (VSHF) co-exists with small scale turbulence. The VSHF\nconsists of internal gravity waves and the turbulent flow has a kinetic energy\n(KE) spectrum that follows an approximate $k^{-3}$ scaling with zero KE flux\nand a robust positive enstrophy flux. The spectrum of the turbulent potential\nenergy (PE) also approximately follows a $k^{-3}$ power-law and its flux is\ndirected to small scales. For moderate stratification, there is no VSHF and the\nKE of the turbulent flow exhibits Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling that transitions\nfrom a shallow $k^{-11/5}$ form at large scales, to a steeper approximate\n$k^{-3}$ scaling at small scales. The entire range of scales shows a strong\nforward enstrophy flux, and interestingly, large (small) scales show an inverse\n(forward) KE flux. The PE flux in this regime is directed to small scales, and\nthe PE spectrum is characterized by an approximate $k^{-1.64}$ scaling.\nFinally, for weak stratification, KE is transferred upscale and its spectrum\nclosely follows a $k^{-2.5}$ scaling, while PE exhibits a forward transfer and\nits spectrum shows an approximate $k^{-1.6}$ power-law. For all stratification\nstrengths, the total energy always flows from large to small scales and almost\nall the spectral indices are well explained by accounting for the scale\ndependent nature of the corresponding flux.\n", "  Due to it's simplicity the diffuse mismatch model (DMM) remains a popular\ndescription of phonon transmission across solid-solid boundaries. However, it\nremains unclear in which situations the DMM should be expected to be a valid\nmodel of the underlying physics. Here, its validity is investigated\nmode-by-mode using a 3-dimensional extension of the frequency domain, perfectly\nmatched layer (FD-PML) method, to study the interface between face-centered\ncubic solids with interdiffused atoms. While submonolayer levels of\ninterdiffusion are found to increase the number of available modes for\ntransmission, consistent qualitatively with the DMM, we do not find\nquantitative or qualitative convergence toward the DMM at higher levels of\ninterdiffusion. In particular, contrary to the fundamental assumption of the\nDMM, modes are not found to lose memory of their initial polarization and\nwavevector. The transmission coefficients of randomly interdiffused and\nsmoothly-graded interfaces are also compared. While smoothly graded interfaces\nshow strong anti-reflection properties, selection rules still prohibit\ntransmission of many modes, whereas interdiffused interfaces are not subject to\nsuch rules and achieve similar thermal interface conductance by transmitting\nwith lower probability but using a wider range of modes.\n", "  The in-out formalism is a systematic and powerful method for finding the\neffective actions in an electromagnetic field and a curved spacetime provided\nthat the field equation has explicitly known solutions. The effective action\nbecomes complex when pairs of charged particles are produced due to an electric\nfield and curved spacetime. This may lead to a conjecture of one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the vacuum polarization (real part) and the vacuum\npersistence (imaginary part). We illustrate the one-loop effective action in a\nconstant electric field in a Minkowski spacetime and in a uniform electric\nfield in a two-dimensional (anti-) de sitter space.\n", "  The features of vacuum particle creation in an external classical field are\nstudied for simplest external field models in $3 + 1$ dimensional QED. The\ninvestigation is based on a kinetic equation that is a nonperturbative\nconsequence of the fundamental equations of motion of QED. The observed\nfeatures of the evolution of the system apply on the qualitative level also for\nsystems of other nature and therefore are rather general. Examples from\ncosmology and condensed matter physics illustrate this statement. The common\nbasis for the description of these systems are kinetic equations for vacuum\nparticle creation belonging to the class of integro-differential equations of\nnon-Markovian type with fastly oscillating kernel. This allows to characterize\nprocesses of this type as belonging to the class of field induced phase\ntransitions.\n", "  A formalism is presented for treating strongly-correlated graphene quantum\nHall states in terms of an SO(8) fermion dynamical symmetry that includes\npairing as well as particle--hole generators. The graphene SO(8) algebra is\nisomorphic to an SO(8) algebra that has found broad application in nuclear\nphysics, albeit with physically very different generators, and exhibits a\nstrong formal similarity to SU(4) symmetries that have been proposed to\ndescribe high-temperature superconductors. The well-known SU(4) symmetry of\nquantum Hall ferromagnetism for single-layer graphene is recovered as one\nsubgroup of SO(8), but the dynamical symmetry structure associated with the\nfull set of SO(8) subgroup chains extends quantum Hall ferromagnetism and\nallows analytical many-body solutions for a rich set of collective states\nexhibiting spontaneously-broken symmetry that may be important for the\nlow-energy physics of graphene in strong magnetic fields. The SO(8) symmetry\npermits a natural definition of generalized coherent states that correspond to\nsymmetry-constrained Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov solutions, or equivalently a\nmicroscopically-derived Ginzburg--Landau formalism, exhibiting the interplay\nbetween competing spontaneously broken symmetries in determining the ground\nstate.\n", "  We propose a scheme to simulate lattice spin models based on strong and\nlong-range interacting Rydberg atoms stored in a large-spacing array of\nmagnetic microtraps. Each spin is encoded in a collective spin state involving\na single $nP$ Rydberg atom excited from an ensemble of ground-state alkali\natoms prepared via Rydberg blockade. After the excitation laser is switched off\nthe Rydberg spin states on neighbouring lattice sites interact via general\nisotropic or anisotropic spin-spin interactions. To read out the collective\nspin states we propose a single Rydberg atom triggered avalanche scheme in\nwhich the presence of a single Rydberg atom conditionally transfers a large\nnumber of ground-state atoms in the trap to an untrapped state which can be\nreadily detected by site-resolved absorption imaging. Such a quantum simulator\nshould allow the study of quantum spin systems in almost arbitrary\ntwo-dimensional configurations. This paves the way towards engineering exotic\nspin models, such as spin models based on triangular-symmetry lattices which\ncan give rise to frustrated-spin magnetism.\n", "  We discuss the notion of symmetries in non-local field theories characterized\nby integro-differential equations of motion, from a geometric perspective. We\nthen focus on Group Field Theory (GFT) models of quantum gravity and provide a\ngeneral analysis of their continuous point symmetry transformations, including\nthe generalized conservation laws following from them.\n", "  Calibration of the polarization basis between the transmitter and receiver is\nan important task in quantum key distribution (QKD). An effective\npolarization-basis tracking scheme will decrease the quantum bit error rate\n(QBER) and improve the efficiency of a polarization encoding QKD system. In\nthis paper, we proposed a polarization-basis tracking scheme using only\nunveiled sifted key bits while performing error correction by legitimate users,\nrather than introducing additional reference light or interrupting the\ntransmission of quantum signals. A polarization-encoding fiber BB84 QKD\nprototype was developed to examine the validity of this scheme. An average QBER\nof 2.32% and a standard derivation of 0.87% have been obtained during 24 hours\nof continuous operation.\n", "  Secure communication protocols are becoming increasingly important, e.g. for\ninternet-based communication. Quantum key distribution allows two parties,\ncommonly called Alice and Bob, to generate a secret sequence of 0s and 1s\ncalled a key that is only known to themselves. Classically, Alice and Bob could\nnever be certain that their communication was not compromised by a malicious\neavesdropper. Quantum mechanics however makes secure communication possible.\nThe fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that taking a measurement\nperturbs the system (unless the measurement is compatible with the quantum\nstate) also applies to an eavesdropper. Using appropriate protocols to create\nthe key, Alice and Bob can detect the presence of an eavesdropper by errors in\ntheir measurements. As part of the QuVis Quantum Mechanics Visualization\nProject, we have developed a suite of four interactive simulations that\ndemonstrate the basic principles of three different quantum key distribution\nprotocols. The simulations use either polarized photons or spin 1/2 particles\nas physical realizations. The simulations and accompanying activities are\nfreely available for use online or download, and run on a wide range of devices\nincluding tablets and PCs. Evaluation with students over three years was used\nto refine the simulations and activities. Preliminary studies show that the\nrefined simulations and activities help students learn the basic principles of\nQKD at both the introductory and advanced undergraduate levels.\n", "  Shell models of turbulence have a finite-time blowup in the inviscid limit,\ni.e., the enstrophy diverges while the single-shell velocities stay finite. The\nsignature of this blowup is represented by self-similar instantonic structures\ntraveling coherently through the inertial range. These solutions might\ninfluence the energy transfer and the anomalous scaling properties empirically\nobserved for the forced and viscous models. In this paper we present a study of\nthe instantonic solutions for a set of four shell models of turbulence based on\nthe exact decomposition of the Navier-Stokes equations in helical eigenstates.\nWe find that depending on the helical structure of each model, instantons are\nchaotic or regular. Some instantonic solutions tend to recover mirror symmetry\nfor scales small enough. Models that have anomalous scaling develop regular non\nchaotic instantons. Conversely, models that have non anomalous scaling in the\nstationary regime are those that have chaotic instantons. The direction of the\nenergy carried by each single instanton tends to coincide with the direction of\nthe energy cascade in the stationary regime. Finally, we find that whenever the\nsmall-scale stationary statistics is intermittent, the instanton is less steep\nthan the dimensional Kolmogorov scaling, independently of whether or not it is\nchaotic. Our findings further support the idea that instantons might be crucial\nto describe some aspects of the multi-scale anomalous statistics of shell\nmodels.\n", "  Quantum digital signature (QDS) is an approach to guarantee the\nnonrepudiation, unforgeability and transferability of a signature with the\ninformation-theoretical security. All previous experimental realizations of QDS\nrelied on an unrealistic assumption of secure channels and the longest distance\nis only several kilometers. Here, we have experimentally demonstrated a\nrecently proposed QDS protocol without any secure channel. Exploiting the decoy\nstate modulation, we have successfully signed one bit message through up to 102\nkm optical fiber. Furthermore, we continuously run the system to sign the\nlonger message \"USTC\" with 32 bit at the distance of 51 km. Our results pave\nthe way towards the practical application of QDS.\n", "  The momentum UV cutoff in Quantum Field Theory is usually treated as an\nauxiliary device allowing to obtain finite amplitudes satisfying all physical\nrequirements. It is even absent (not explicit) in the most popular approach -\nthe dimensional regularization. We point out that the momentum cutoff treated\nas a bona fide physical scale, presumably equal or related to the Planck scale,\nwould lead to unacceptable predictions. One of the dangers is a non-zero mass\nof the photon. In the naive approach, even with the cutoff equal to the Planck\nscale, this mass would grossly exceed the existing experimental bounds. We\npresent the actual calculation using a concrete realization of the physical\ncutoff and speculate about the way to restore gauge symmetry order by order in\nthe inverse powers of the cutoff scale.\n", "  Weyl semimetal (WSM) is an exotic topological state in condensed matter\nphysics. In this paper, based on a two-band cubic lattice model, we studied\nWSMs with a pair of tunable Weyl nodes. It is pointed out that there exist\nthree types of WSMs with different tilt strengths: type-I WSM, type-II WSM and\ntype-1.5 WSM. In particular, type-1.5 WSM has one type-I node and one type-II\nnode. We studied chiral modes, surface Fermi arcs and quantum anomalous Hall\neffect in different types of WSMs. In addition, we give an experimental setup\nto realize the different types of WSMs based on timely technique.\n", "  The Lee-Yang theory of adsorbing self-avoiding walks is presented. It is\nshown that Lee-Yang zeros of the generating function of this model\nasymptotically accumulate uniformly on a circle in the complex plane, and that\nFisher zeros of the partition function distribute in the complex plane such\nthat a positive fraction are located in annular regions centered at the origin.\nThese results are examined in a numerical study of adsorbing self-avoiding\nwalks in the square and cubic lattices. The numerical data are consistent with\nthe rigorous results; for example, Lee-Yang zeros are found to accumulate on a\ncircle in the complex plane and a positive fraction of partition function zeros\nappear to accumulate on a critical circle. The radial and angular distribution\nof partition function zeros are also examined and it is found to be consistent\nwith the rigorous results on the Fisher zeros of interacting lattice clusters.\n", "  The broadening of lines by Stark effect is widely used for inferring electron\ndensity and temperature in plasmas. Stark-effect calculations often rely on\natomic data (transition rates, energy levels,...) not always exhaustive and/or\nvalid only for isolated atoms. In this work, we first present a recent\ndevelopment in the detailed opacity code SCO-RCG for K-shell spectroscopy. The\napproach is adapted from the work of Gilles and Peyrusse. Neglecting\nnon-diagonal terms in dipolar and collision operators, the line profile is\nexpressed as a sum of Voigt functions associated to the Stark components. The\nformalism relies on the use of parabolic coordinates and the relativistic\nfine-structure of Lyman lines is included by diagonalizing the hamiltonian\nmatrix associated to quantum states having the same principal quantum number n.\nThe SCO-RCG code enables one to investigate plasma environment effects, the\nimpact of the microfield distribution, the decoupling between electron and ion\ntemperatures and the role of satellite lines (such as Li-like 1s nl n'l' - 1s2\nnl, Be-like, etc.). Atomic-structure calculations have reached levels of\naccuracy which require evaluation of Breit interaction and many-electron\nquantum electro-dynamics (QED) contributions. Although much work was done for\nQED effects (self-energy and vacuum polarization) in hydrogenic atoms, the case\nof an arbitrary number of electrons is more complicated. Since exact analytic\nsolutions do not exist, a number of heuristic methods have been used to\napproximate the screening of additional \\'electrons in the self-energy part. We\ncompare different ways of including such effects in atomic-structure codes\n(Slater-Condon, Multi-Configuration Dirac-Fock, etc.).\n", "  Photon blockade is a dynamical quantum-nonlinear effect that occurs in driven\nsystems with an anharmonic excitation ladder. For a single atom strongly\ncoupled to an optical cavity, we show that driving the atom gives a decisively\nlarger optical nonlinearity than driving the cavity. This enhances\nsingle-photon blockade and allows for the implementation of two-photon blockade\nwhere the absorption of two photons suppresses the absorption of further\nphotons. As a signature, we report on three-photon antibunching with\nsimultaneous two-photon bunching observed in the light emitted from the cavity.\nOur experiment constitutes a significant step towards multi-photon\nquantum-nonlinear optics.\n", "  We investigate predictions on the triple Higgs boson couplings with radiative\ncorrections in the model with an additional real singlet scalar field. In this\nmodel, the second physical scalar state ($H$) appears in addition to the Higgs\nboson ($h$) with the mass 125 GeV. The $hhh$ vertex is calculated at the\none-loop level, and its possible deviation from the predictions in the standard\nmodel is evaluated under various theoretical constraints. The decay rate of $H\n\\to hh$ is also computed at the one-loop level. We also take into account the\nbound from the precise measurement of the $W$ boson mass, which gives the upper\nlimit on the mixing angle $\\alpha$ between two physical Higgs bosons for a\ngiven value of the mass of $H$ ($m_H^{}$). We find that the deviation in the\n$hhh$ coupling from the prediction in the standard model can maximally be about\n250\\%, 150\\% and 75\\% for $m_H^{}=300$, 500 and 1000 GeV, respectively, under\nthe requirement that the cutoff scale of the model is higher than 3 TeV. We\nalso discuss deviations from the standard model prediction in double Higgs\nboson production from the gluon fusion at the LHC using the one-loop corrected\nHiggs boson vertices.\n", "  Analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) datasets typically requires\nsome filtering of the raw time-ordered data. Filtering is frequently used to\nminimize the impact of low frequency noise, atmospheric contributions and/or\nscan synchronous signals on the resulting maps. In this work we explicitly\nconstruct a general filtering operator, which can unambiguously remove any set\nof unwanted modes in the data, and then amend the map-making procedure in order\nto incorporate and correct for it. We show that such an approach is\nmathematically equivalent to the solution of a problem in which the sky signal\nand unwanted modes are estimated simultaneously and the latter are marginalized\nover. We investigate the conditions under which this amended map-making\nprocedure can render an unbiased estimate of the sky signal in realistic\ncircumstances. We then study the effects of time-domain filtering on the noise\ncorrelation structure in the map domain, as well as impact it may have on the\nperformance of the popular pseudo-spectrum estimators. We conclude that\nalthough maps produced by the proposed estimators arguably provide the most\nfaithful representation of the sky possible given the data, they may not\nstraightforwardly lead to the best constraints on the power spectra of the\nunderlying sky signal and special care may need to be taken to ensure this is\nthe case. By contrast, simplified map-makers which do not explicitly correct\nfor time-domain filtering, but leave it to subsequent steps in the data\nanalysis, may perform equally well and be easier and faster to implement. We\nfocus on polarization-sensitive measurements targeting the B-mode component of\nthe CMB signal and apply the proposed methods to realistic simulations based on\ncharacteristics of an actual CMB polarization experiment, POLARBEAR.\n", "  We discuss the modulational instability (MI) of plane waves in nonlocal Kerr\nmedia with the sine-oscillation response function, which can model the nematic\nliquid crystal with negative dielectric anisotropy. The results in the\nframework of the nonlocal nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation show that the MI\nin this system has two extraordinary properties. First, MI exists in both cases\nof negative Kerr coefficient $(n_{2}<0)$ and positive Kerr coefficient\n$(n_{2}>0)$. Second, the maximum gain of MI is not affected by the intensity of\nthe plane wave, and the wave number %spatial frequency of the maximum gain\ndepends on the oscillation period of the response function. We also explore,\nfor the first time to the best of our knowledge, the physical mechanism of MI\nin the framework of the four-wave mixing (FWM). %FWM interaction. By\nintroducing a phase mismatch term $\\triangle k$ and a (nonlinear) growth factor\n$\\gamma$ (both of them have clear physical meanings), we find that the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the MI appearance is that the phase\nmismatching during the FWM process should be small enough such that $|\\triangle\nk|<2|\\gamma|$. Basing on the discover, we present a new scenario to uniformly\nand consistently explain why the MI can happen for the focusing local Kerr\nmedia and cannot for the defocusing local Kerr media, as well as the MI\nphenomena in the nonlocal cases.\n", "  We experimentally investigate dissipation in mechanical resonators made of a\ndisordered superconducting thin film of Molybdenum-Rhenium(MoRe) alloy. By\nelectrostatically driving the drum with a resonant AC voltage, we detect its\nmotion using a superconducting microwave cavity. From the temperature\ndependence of mechanical resonance frequencies and quality factors, we find\nevidence for non-resonant, mechanically active two-level systems (TLSs)\nlimiting its quality factor at low temperature. In addition, we observe a\nstrong suppression of mechanical dissipation at large mechanical driving\namplitudes, suggesting an unconventional saturation of the non-resonant TLSs.\nThese new observations shed light on the mechanism of mechanical damping in\nsuperconducting drums and routes towards understanding dissipation in such\nmechanical systems.\n", "  We characterize the separability of three qubit GHZ diagonal states in terms\nof entries. This enables us to check separability of GHZ diagonal states\nwithout decomposition into the sum of pure product states. In the course of\ndiscussion, we show that the necessary criterion of G\\\"uhne for (full)\nseparability of three qubit GHZ diagonal states is sufficient with a simpler\nformula. The main tool is to use entanglement witnesses which are tri-partite\nChoi matrices of positive bi-linear maps.\n", "  Ultra-relativistic Heavy-Ion Collision (HIC) generates very strong initial\nmagnetic field ($\\vec B$) inducing a vorticity in the reaction plane. The high\n$\\vec{B}$ influences the evolution dynamics that is opposed by the large\nFaraday current due to electric field generated by the time varying $\\vec{B}$.\nWe show that the resultant effects entail a significantly large directed flow\n($v_1$) of charm quarks (CQs) compared to light quarks due to a combination of\nseveral favorable conditions for CQs, mainly: (i) unlike light quarks formation\ntime scale of CQs, $\\tau_f \\simeq \\, 0.1 \\rm fm/c$ is comparable to the time\nscale when $\\vec B$ attains its maximum value and (ii) the kinetic relaxation\ntime of CQs is similar to the QGP lifetime, this helps the CQ to retain the\ninitial kick picked up from the electromagnetic field in the transverse\ndirection. The effect is also odd under charge exchange allowing to distinguish\nit from the vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum\nconservation; conjointly thanks to its mass, $M_c >>\\Lambda_{QCD}$, there\nshould be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics. Hence CQs provide very\ncrucial and independent information on the strength of the magnetic field\nproduced in HIC.\n", "  The dissipation mechanism by which the magnetic field reconnects in the\npresence of an external (guide) magnetic field in the direction of the main\ncurrent is not well understood. In thin electron current sheets (ECS)\n(thickness ~ an electron inertial length) formed in collisionless magnetic\nreconnection, electron shear flow instabilities (ESFI) are potential candidates\nfor providing an anomalous dissipation mechanism which can break the frozen-in\ncondition of the magnetic field affecting the structure and rate of\nreconnection. We investigate the evolution of ESFI in guide field magnetic\nreconnection. The properties of the resulting plasma turbulence and their\ndependence on the strength of the guide field are studied. Utilizing 3-D\nelectron-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of ECS we show that, unlike the case\nof ECS self-consistently embedded in anti-parallel magnetic fields, the\nevolution of thin ECS in the presence of a guide field (equal to the asymptotic\nvalue of the reconnecting magnetic field or larger) is dominated by high wave\nnumber non-tearing mode instabilities. The latter cause the development of,\nfirst, a wavy structure of the ECS. The turbulence, developed later, consists\nof current filaments and electron flow vortices. As a result of the nonlinear\nevolution of the instability, the ECS broadens simultaneously with its\nflattening in the central region mimicking a viscous-like turbulent\ndissipation. Later, the flattened ECS bifurcates. During the time of the\nbifurcation, the rate of the change of the mean electron flow velocity is\nproportional to the magnitude of the flow velocity, suggesting a resistive-like\ndissipation. The turbulence energy cascades to shorter wavelengths\npreferentially in the direction perpendicular to the guide magnetic field. The\ndegree of anisotropy of the turbulence was found to increase with the\nincreasing strength of the guide field.\n", "  The fate of small particles in turbulent flows depends strongly on the\nsurrounding fluid's velocity gradient properties such as rotation and\nstrain-rates. For non-inertial (fluid) particles, the Restricted Euler model\nprovides a simple, low-dimensional dynamical system representation of\nLagrangian evolution of velocity gradients in fluid turbulence, at least for\nshort times. Here we derive a new restricted Euler dynamical system for the\nvelocity gradient evolution of inertial particles such as solid particles in a\ngas or droplets and bubbles in turbulent liquid flows. The model is derived in\nthe limit of small (sub Kolmogorov scale) particles and low Stokes number. The\nsystem exhibits interesting fixed points, stability and invariant properties.\nComparisons with data from Direct Numerical Simulations show that the model\npredicts realistic trends such as the tendency of increased straining over\nrotation along heavy particle trajectories and, for light particles such as\nbubbles, the tendency of reduced self-stretching of strain-rate.\n", "  We re-analyze the nonlocal gravity model of Deser and Woodard which was\nproposed to account for the current phase of cosmic acceleration. We show that\nthe growth of perturbations predicted by this nonlocal gravity model when its\nbackground evolution is fixed by some particular non-$\\Lambda$CDM models can be\nsubstantially lower than when its background is fixed by $\\Lambda$CDM. This can\nbe seen when we consider the background expansion by a dark energy model with a\nslightly less negative equation of state with respect to cosmological constant.\nOur results hints towards a fact that the choice of the background expansion\ncan play a crucial role how this nonlocal gravity model can fit the growth\nhistory data. While the growth data might show better consistency to GR models\n(among the background models we studied so far), it seems the nonlocal gravity\nmodel studied in this work is able to show comparable consistency to the growth\ndata as well. Showing this consistency can be considered as a significant\nresult since this model can stand as a distinguishable alternative to the\nstandard model of cosmology.\n", "  We use the DBI action from string theory and holography to study the\nmagneto-resistance at quantum criticality with hyperscaling violation. We find\nand analyze a rich class of scaling behaviors for the magneto-resistance. A\nspecial case describes the scaling results found in pnictides by Hayers et al.\nin~\\cite{analytis}.\n", "  We report on the existence of a new type of cosmic string solutions in the\nWitten model with U(1)xU(1) symmetry. These solutions are superconducting with\nradially excited condensates that exist for both gauge and ungauged currents.\nOur results suggest that these new configurations can be macroscopically\nstable, but microscopically unstable to radial perturbations. Nevertheless,\nthey might have important consequences for the network evolution and particle\nemission. We discuss these effects and their possible signatures. We also\ncomment on analogies with non-relativistic condensed matter systems where these\nsolutions may be observable.\n", "  We consider the Standard Model extended by a heavy scalar singlet in\ndifferent regions of parameter space and construct the appropriate low-energy\neffective field theories up to first nontrivial order. This top-down exercise\nin effective field theory is meant primarily to illustrate with a simple\nexample the systematics of the linear and nonlinear electroweak effective\nLagrangians and to clarify the relation between them. We discuss power-counting\naspects and the transition between both effective theories on the basis of the\nmodel, confirming in all cases the rules and procedures derived in previous\nworks from a bottom-up approach.\n", "  We explore the ability of current and future dark matter and collider\nexperiments in probing anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\\mu$,\nwithin the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We find that the\nlatest PandaX-II/LUX-2016 data gives a strong constraint on parameter space\nthat accommodates the $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ within $2\\sigma$ range, which will be\nfurther excluded by the upcoming XENON-1T (2017) experiment. We also find that\na 100 TeV $pp$ collider can cover most of our surviving samples that satisfy DM\nrelic density within $3\\sigma$ range through $Z$ or $h$ resonant effect by\nsearching for trilepton events from $\\tilde{\\chi}^0_2\\tilde{\\chi}^+_1$\nassociated production. While the samples that are beyond future sensitivity of\ntrilepton search at a 100 TeV $pp$ collider and the DM direct detections are\neither higgsino/wino-like LSPs or bino-like LSPs co-annihilating with sleptons.\nSuch compressed regions may be covered by the monojet(-like) searches at a 100\nTeV $pp$ collider.\n", "  We present our investigations on the superconducting properties of monolayers\nof FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ grown on the 3D topological insulator\nBi$_{2}$Se$_{1.2}$Te$_{1.8}$ using low temperature scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS). While the morphology and the overall transition temperature\nresemble those of similarly doped bulk crystals, the spatially resolved\nspectroscopic data at 1.1K shows a much larger spatial inhomogeneity in the\nsuperconducting energy gaps. Despite the gap inhomogeneity all the spectra can\nbe fitted with a two-fold anisotropic s-wave gap function. The two-fold nature\nof the gap symmetry is evident from the Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference\n(QPI) pattern which shows distinct C$_{2}$ symmetric scattering intensities. We\nargue that the gap inhomogeneity emerges as a result of intrinsic disorder in\nour system similar to disordered conventional superconductors. Even though most\nof our findings clearly differ from the current understanding of the\ncorresponding bulk system, it provides an ideal platform to study\nunconventional superconductivity in Fe chalcogenides thinned down to a single\nlayer and in close proximity to a topological insulator.\n", "  We present pressure profiles of galaxy clusters determined from high\nresolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect observations of fourteen clusters,\nwhich span the redshift range $ 0.25 < z < 0.89$. The procedure simultaneously\nfits spherical cluster models to MUSTANG and Bolocam data. In this analysis, we\nadopt the generalized NFW parameterization of pressure profiles to produce our\nmodels. Our constraints on ensemble-average pressure profile parameters, in\nthis study $\\gamma$, $C_{500}$, and $P_0$, are consistent with those in\nprevious studies, but for individual clusters we find discrepancies with the\nX-ray derived pressure profiles from the ACCEPT2 database. We investigate\npotential sources of these discrepancies, especially cluster geometry, electron\ntemperature of the intracluster medium, and substructure. We find that the\nensemble mean profile for all clusters in our sample is described by the\nparameters: $[\\gamma,C_{500},P_0] = [0.3_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 1.3_{-0.1}^{+0.1},\n8.6_{-2.4}^{+2.4}]$, for cool core clusters: $[\\gamma,C_{500},P_0] =\n[0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 0.9_{-0.1}^{+0.1}, 3.6_{-1.5}^{+1.5}]$, and for disturbed\nclusters: $[\\gamma,C_{500},P_0] = [0.0_{-0.0}^{+0.1},\n1.5_{-0.2}^{+0.1},13.8_{-1.6}^{+1.6}]$. Four of the fourteen clusters have\nclear substructure in our SZ observations, while an additional two clusters\nexhibit potential substructure.\n", "  When a three-dimensional electron gas is subjected to a very strong magnetic\nfield, it can reach a quasi-one-dimensional state in which all electrons occupy\nthe lowest Landau level. This state is referred to as the extreme quantum limit\n(EQL) and has been studied in the physics of pulsars and bulk semiconductors.\nHere we present a theory of the EQL phase in electron accumulation layers\ncreated by an external electric field $E$ at the surface of a semiconductor\nwith a large Bohr radius such as InSb, PbTe, SrTiO$_3$ (STO), and particularly\nin the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) heterostructure. The phase diagram of the\nelectron gas in the plane of the magnetic field strength and the electron\nsurface concentration is found for different orientations of the magnetic\nfield. We find that in addition to the quasi-classical metallic phase (M),\nthere is a metallic EQL phase, as well as an insulating Wigner crystal state\n(WC). Within the EQL phase, the Thomas-Fermi approximation is used to find the\nelectron density and the electrostatic potential profiles of the accumulation\nlayer. Additionally, the quantum capacitance for each phase is calculated as a\ntool for experimental study of these phase diagrams.\n", "  Comparative studies of capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges in\nhelium and argon at pressures between 10 and 80 Pa are presented applying two\ndifferent fluid modelling approaches as well as two independently developed\nparticle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) codes. The focus is on the\nanalysis of the range of applicability of a recently proposed fluid model\nincluding an improved drift-diffusion approximation for the electron component\nas well as its comparison with fluid modelling results using the classical\ndrift-diffusion approximation and benchmark results obtained by PIC/MCC\nsimulations. Main features of this time- and space-dependent fluid model are\ngiven. It is found that the novel approach shows generally quite good agreement\nwith the macroscopic properties derived by the kinetic simulations and is\nlargely able to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the discharge\nbehaviour even at conditions when the classical fluid modelling approach fails.\nFurthermore, the excellent agreement between the two PIC/MCC simulation codes\nusing the velocity Verlet method for the integration of the equations of motion\nverifies their accuracy and applicability.\n", "  An inverse cascade - energy transfer to progressively larger scales - is a\nsalient feature of two-dimensional turbulence. If the cascade reaches the\nsystem scale, it creates a coherent flow expected to have the largest available\nscale and conform with the symmetries of the domain. In a doubly periodic\nrectangle, the mean flow with zero total momentum was therefore believed to be\nunidirectional, with two jets along the short side; while for an aspect ratio\nclose to unity, a vortex dipole was expected. Using direct numerical\nsimulations, we show that in fact neither the box symmetry is respected nor the\nlargest scale is realized: the flow is never purely unidirectional since the\ninverse cascade produces coherent vortices, whose number and relative motion\nare determined by the aspect ratio. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is\nclosely related to the hierarchy of averaging times. Long-time averaging\nrestores translational invariance due to vortex wandering along one direction,\nand gives jets whose profile, however, can be deduced neither from the\nlargest-available-scale argument, nor from the often employed maximum-entropy\nprinciple or quasi-linear approximation.\n", "  We report the discovery of KELT-12b, a highly inflated Jupiter-mass planet\ntransiting a mildly evolved host star. We identified the initial transit signal\nin the KELT-North survey data and established the planetary nature of the\ncompanion through precise follow-up photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy,\nprecise radial velocity measurements, and high-resolution adaptive optics\nimaging. Our preferred best-fit model indicates that the $V = 10.64$ host, TYC\n2619-1057-1, has $T_{\\rm eff} = 6278 \\pm 51$ K, $\\log{g_\\star} =\n3.89^{+0.054}_{-0.051}$, and [Fe/H] = $0.19^{+0.083}_{-0.085}$, with an\ninferred mass $M_{\\star} = 1.59^{+0.071}_{-0.091} M_\\odot$ and radius $R_\\star\n= 2.37 \\pm 0.18 R_\\odot$. The planetary companion has $M_{\\rm P} = 0.95 \\pm\n0.14 M_{\\rm J}$, $R_{\\rm P} = 1.79^{+0.18}_{-0.17} R_{\\rm J}$, $\\log{g_{\\rm P}}\n= 2.87^{+0.097}_{-0.098}$, and density $\\rho_{\\rm P} = 0.21^{+0.075}_{-0.054}$\ng cm$^{-3}$, making it one of the most inflated giant planets known. The time\nof inferior conjunction in ${\\rm BJD_{TDB}}$ is $2457088.692055 \\pm 0.0009$ and\nthe period is $P = 5.0316144 \\pm 0.0000306$ days. Despite the relatively large\nseparation of $\\sim0.07$ AU implied by its $\\sim 5.03$-day orbital period,\nKELT-12b receives significant flux of $2.93^{+0.33}_{-0.30} \\times 10^9$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ from its host. We compare the radii and insolations of\ntransiting gas-giant planets around hot ($T_{\\rm eff} \\geq 6250$ K) and cool\nstars, noting that the observed paucity of known transiting giants around hot\nstars with low insolation is likely due to selection effects. We underscore the\nsignificance of long-term ground-based monitoring of hot stars and space-based\ntargeting of hot stars with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to\nsearch for inflated giants in longer-period orbits.\n", "  By using the boundary derivative expansion formalism of fluid/gravity\ncorrespondence, we study the chiral vortical effect from the compactified\nD4-branes with smeared D0-brane charge. This background corresponds to a\nstrongly coupled, nonconformal relativistic fluid with a conserved vector\ncurrent. The presence of the chiral vortical effect is induced by the addition\nof a Chern-Simons term in the bulk action. Except that the non-dissipative\nanomalous viscous coefficient and the sound speed rely only on the chemical\npotential, most of the other thermal and hydrodynamical quantities of the first\norder depend both on the temperature and the chemical potential. According to\nour result, the way that the chiral vortical effect coefficient depends on the\nchemical potential seems irrelevant with whether the relativistic fluid is\nconformal or not. Stability analysis shows that this anomalous relativistic\nfluid is stable and the doping of the smeared D0-brane charge will slow down\nthe sound speed.\n", "  Using combined asteroseismic and spectroscopic observations of 418 red-giant\nstars close to the Galactic disc plane (6 kpc $<R_{\\rm Gal}\\lesssim13$ kpc,\n$|Z_{\\rm Gal}|<0.3$ kpc), we measure the age dependence of the radial\nmetallicity distribution in the Milky Way's thin disc over cosmic time. The\nslope of the radial iron gradient of the young red-giant population\n($-0.058\\pm0.008$ [stat.] $\\pm0.003$ [syst.] dex/kpc) is consistent with recent\nCepheid measurements. For stellar populations with ages of $1-4$ Gyr the\ngradient is slightly steeper, at a value of $-0.066\\pm0.007\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc,\nand then flattens again to reach a value of $\\sim-0.03$ dex/kpc for stars with\nages between 6 and 10 Gyr. Our results are in good agreement with a\nstate-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the evolution of the\nabundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely explained by a non-varying\nnegative metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium, together with stellar\nradial heating and migration. We also offer an explanation for why\nintermediate-age open clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood can be more\nmetal-rich, and why their radial metallicity gradient seems to be much steeper\nthan that of the youngest clusters. Already within 2 Gyr, radial mixing can\nbring metal-rich clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to\nGalactocentric radii of 5 to 8 kpc. We suggest that these outward-migrating\nclusters may be less prone to tidal disruption and therefore steepen the local\nintermediate-age cluster metallicity gradient. Our scenario also explains why\nthe strong steepening of the local iron gradient with age is not seen in field\nstars. In the near future, asteroseismic data from the K2 mission will allow\nfor improved statistics and a better coverage of the inner-disc regions,\nthereby providing tighter constraints on the evolution of the central parts of\nthe Milky Way.\n", "  We investigate spin correlations in the dipolar Heisenberg antiferromagnet\nGd2Sn2O7 using polarised neutron-scattering measurements in the correlated\nparamagnetic regime. Using Monte Carlo methods, we show that our data are\nsensitive to weak further-neighbour exchange interactions of magnitude ~0.5% of\nthe nearest-neighbour interaction, and are compatible with either\nantiferromagnetic next-nearest neighbour interactions, or ferromagnetic\nthird-neighbour interactions that connect spins across hexagonal loops.\nCalculations of the magnetic scattering intensity reveal rods of diffuse\nscattering along [111] reciprocal-space directions, which we explain in terms\nof strong antiferromagnetic correlations parallel to the set of <110>\ndirections that connect a given spin with its nearest neighbours. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the spin correlations in Gd2Sn2O7 are highly anisotropic, and\ncorrelations parallel to third-neighbour separations are particularly sensitive\nto critical fluctuations associated with incipient long-range order.\n", "  Many basis sets for electronic structure calculations evolve with varying\nexternal parameters, such as moving atoms in dynamic simulations, giving rise\nto extra derivative terms in the dynamical equations. Here we revisit these\nderivatives in the context of differential geometry, thereby obtaining a more\ntransparent formalisation, and a geometrical perspective for better\nunderstanding the resulting equations. The effect of the evolution of the basis\nset within the spanned Hilbert space separates explicitly from the effect of\nthe turning of the space itself when moving in parameter space, as the tangent\nspace turns when moving in a curved space. New insights are obtained using\nfamiliar concepts in that context such as the Riemann curvature. The\ndifferential geometry is not strictly that for curved spaces as in general\nrelativity, a more adequate mathematical framework being provided by fibre\nbundles. The language used here, however, will be restricted to tensors and\nbasic quantum mechanics. The local gauge implied by a smoothly varying basis\nset readily connects with Berry's formalism for geometric phases. Generalised\nexpressions for the Berry connection and curvature are obtained for a\nparameter-dependent occupied Hilbert space spanned by non-orthogonal Wannier\nfunctions. The formalism is applicable to basis sets made of atomic-like\norbitals and also more adaptative moving basis functions (such as in methods\nusing Wannier functions as intermediate or support bases), but should also\napply to other situations in which non-orthogonal functions or related\nprojectors should arise. The formalism is applied to the time-dependent quantum\nevolution of electrons for moving atoms. The geometric insights provided here\nallow us to propose new finite-differences time integrators, and also better\nunderstand those already proposed.\n", "  We present a 3D finite element solver for the nonlinear Poisson-Nernst-Planck\n(PNP) equations for electrodiffusion, coupled to the Stokes system of fluid\ndynamics. The model serves as a building block for the simulation of\nmacromolecule dynamics inside nanopore sensors.\n  We add to existing numerical approaches by deploying goal-oriented adaptive\nmesh refinement. To reduce the computation overhead of mesh adaptivity, our\nerror estimator uses the much cheaper Poisson-Boltzmann equation as a\nsimplified model, which is justified on heuristic grounds but shown to work\nwell in practice. To address the nonlinearity in the full PNP-Stokes system,\nthree different linearization schemes are proposed and investigated, with two\nsegregated iterative approaches both outperforming a naive application of\nNewton's method. Numerical experiments are reported on a real-world nanopore\nsensor geometry.\n  We also investigate two different models for the interaction of target\nmolecules with the nanopore sensor through the PNP-Stokes equations. In one\nmodel, the molecule is of finite size and is explicitly built into the\ngeometry; while in the other, the molecule is located at a single point and\nonly modeled implicitly -- after solution of the system -- which is\ncomputationally favorable. We compare the resulting force profiles of the\nelectric and velocity fields acting on the molecule, and conclude that the\npoint-size model fails to capture important physical effects such as the\ndependence of charge selectivity of the sensor on the molecule radius.\n", "  We analytically investigate backreaction by a quantum scalar field on two\nrotating Ba\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) geometries: that of a black hole\nand that of a naked singularity. In the former case, we explore the quantum\neffects on various regions of relevance for a rotating black hole space-time.\nWe find that the quantum effects lead to a growth of both the event horizon and\nthe radius of the ergosphere, and to a reduction of the angular velocity,\ncompared to the unperturbed values. Furthermore, they give rise to the\nformation of a curvature singularity at the Cauchy horizon and show no evidence\nof the appearance of a superradiant instability. In the case of a naked\nsingularity, we find that quantum effects lead to the formation of a horizon\nthat shields it, thus supporting evidence for the r\\^ole of quantum mechanics\nas a cosmic censor in nature.\n", "  We estimate strong coupling constant between the negative parity nucleons\nwith $\\pi$ meson within the light cone QCD sum rules. A method for eliminating\nthe unwanted contributions coming from the nucleon--nucleon and\nnucleon--negative parity nucleon transition is presented. It is observed that\nthe value strong coupling constant of the negative parity nucleon $N^\\ast\nN^\\ast \\pi$ transition is considerably different from the one predicted by the\n3--point QCD sum rules, but is quite close to the coupling constant of the\npositive parity $N N \\pi$ transition.\n", "  Hybridization between Ce $f$ and conduction $d$ states has been speculatively\nknown to be one of the mechanisms responsible for magnetic instability of the\nferromagnetic ground state of CeFe$_2$. Substituting Fe by small amounts of\ncertain elements stabilizes it to an antiferromagnetic state below the Curie\ntemperature via a first-order second phase transition. In the present work, we\nseek any direct relation between the $f-d$ hybridization and the second\ntransition by measuring primarily dc magnetization and Ce M$_{4,5}$ edge x-ray\nabsorption spectra of Ce(Fe$_{1-x}$M$_x$)$_2$ pseudobinaries, with M = Cr, Ag\nand Au. X-ray diffraction and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements are\nalso performed essentially to monitor the quality of the samples. Whereas Cr\nimpurity is found to cause the second transition, Ag and Au apparently do not\ninduce any. In the former, the Curie and second transition temperatures vary\nsystematically, but differently, with $x$. Our results imply that there is a\ndefinite proportionality between the $x$ dependences of the second transition\ntemperature and the $f-d$ hybridization strength estimated qualitatively from\nthe absorption spectra.\n", "  We study the Casimir interaction energy due to the vacuum fluctuations of the\nElectromagnetic (EM) field in the presence of two mirrors, described by\n$2+1$-dimensional, generally nonlocal actions, which may contain both\nparity-conserving and parity-breaking terms. We compare the results with the\nones corresponding to Chern-Simons boundary conditions, and evaluate the\ninteraction energy for several particular situations.\n", "  We present the detailed study of the digital readout of Topmetal-II- CMOS\npixel direct charge sensor. Topmetal-II- is an integrated sensor with an array\nof 72X72 pixels each capable of directly collecting external charge through\nexposed metal electrodes in the topmost metal layer. In addition to the\ntime-shared multiplexing readout of the analog output from Charge Sensitive\nAmplifiers in each pixel, hits are also generated through comparators with\nindividually DAC settable thresholds in each pixel. The hits are read out via a\ncolumn-based priority logic structure, retaining both hit location and time\ninformation. The in-array column-based priority logic is fully combinational\nhence there is no clock distributed in the pixel array. Sequential logic and\nclock are placed on the peripheral of the array. We studied the detailed\nworking behavior and performance of this readout, and demonstrated its\npotential in imaging applications.\n", "  This paper presents a study on the physical limitations for radio frequency\nabsorption in gold nanoparticle suspensions. A canonical spherical geometry is\nconsidered consisting of a spherical suspension of colloidal gold nanoparticles\ncharacterized as an arbitrary passive dielectric material which is immersed in\nan arbitrary lossy medium. A relative heating coefficient and a corresponding\noptimal near field excitation are defined taking the skin effect of the\nsurrounding medium into account. For small particle suspensions the optimal\nexcitation is an electric dipole field for which explicit asymptotic\nexpressions are readily obtained. It is then proven that the optimal\npermittivity function yielding a maximal absorption inside the spherical\nsuspension is a conjugate match with respect to the surrounding lossy material.\nFor a surrounding medium consisting of a weak electrolyte solution the optimal\nconjugate match can then readily be realized at a single frequency, e.g., by\ntuning the parameters of a Drude model corresponding to the electrophoretic\nparticle acceleration mechanism. As such, the conjugate match can also be\nregarded to yield an optimal plasmonic resonance. Finally, a convex\noptimization approach is used to investigate the realizability of a passive\nmaterial to approximate the desired conjugate match over a finite bandwidth.\nThe relation of the proposed approach to general Mie theory as well as to the\napproximation of metamaterials are discussed. Numerical examples are included\nto illustrate the ultimate potential of heating in a realistic scenario in the\nmicrowave regime.\n", "  To reduce the x-ray dose in computerized tomography (CT), many constrained\noptimization approaches have been proposed aiming at minimizing a regularizing\nfunction that measures lack of consistency with some prior knowledge about the\nobject that is being imaged, subject to a (predetermined) level of consistency\nwith the detected attenuation of x-rays. Proponents of the shearlet transform\nin the regularizing function claim that the reconstructions so obtained are\nbetter than those produced using TV for texture preservation (but may be worse\nfor noise reduction). In this paper we report results related to this claim. In\nour reported experiments using simulated CT data collection of the head,\nreconstructions whose shearlet transform has a small $\\ell_1$-norm are not more\nefficacious than reconstructions that have a small TV value. Our experiments\nfor making such comparisons use the recently-developed superiorization\nmethodology for both regularizing functions. Superiorization is an automated\nprocedure for turning an iterative algorithm for producing images that satisfy\na primary criterion (such as consistency with the observed measurements) into\nits superiorized version that will produce results that, according to the\nprimary criterion are as good as those produced by the original algorithm, but\nin addition are superior to them according to a secondary (regularizing)\ncriterion. The method presented for superiorization involving the $\\ell_1$-norm\nof the shearlet transform is novel and is quite general: It can be used for any\nregularizing function that is defined as the $\\ell_1$-norm of a transform\nspecified by the application of a matrix. Because in the previous literature\nthe split Bregman algorithm is used for similar purposes, a section is included\ncomparing the results of the superiorization algorithm with the split Bregman\nalgorithm.\n", "  The influence of the finite width of $\\rho$ meson on the pion momentum\ndistribution is studied quantitatively in the framework of the S-matrix\napproach combined with a blast-wave model to describe particle emissions from\nan expanding fireball. We find that the proper treatment of resonances which\naccounts for their production dynamics encoded in data for partial wave\nscattering amplitudes can substantially modify spectra of daughter particles\noriginating in their two body decays. In particular, it results in an\nenhancement of the low-$p_T$ pions from the decays of $\\rho$ mesons which\nimproves the quantitative description of the pion spectra in heavy ion\ncollisions obtained by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC energy.\n", "  Microscopic imaging of local magnetic fields provides a window into the\norganizing principles of complex and technologically relevant condensed matter\nmaterials. However, a wide variety of intriguing strongly correlated and\ntopologically nontrivial materials exhibit poorly understood phenomena outside\nthe detection capability of state-of-the-art high-sensitivity, high-resolution\nscanning probe magnetometers. We introduce a quantum-noise-limited scanning\nprobe magnetometer that can operate from room to cryogenic temperatures with\nunprecedented DC-field sensitivity and micron-scale resolution. The Scanning\nQuantum Cryogenic Atom Microscope (SQCRAMscope) employs a magnetically\nlevitated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), thereby providing immunity to\nconductive and blackbody radiative heating. It has a field sensitivity of 1.4\nnT per resolution-limited point ($\\sim$2 $\\mu$m), or 6 nT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$\nper point at its duty cycle. Compared to point-by-point sensors, the long\nlength of the BEC provides a naturally parallel measurement, allowing one to\nmeasure nearly one-hundred points with an effective field sensitivity of 600\npT$/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for each point during the same time as a point-by-point\nscanner would measure these points sequentially. Moreover, it has a noise floor\nof 300 pT and provides nearly two orders of magnitude improvement in magnetic\nflux sensitivity (down to $10^{-6}$ $\\Phi_0/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$) over previous\natomic probe magnetometers capable of scanning near samples. These capabilities\nare, for the first time, carefully benchmarked by imaging magnetic fields\narising from microfabricated wire patterns, in a system where samples may be\nscanned, cryogenically cooled, and easily exchanged. The SQCRAMscope will\nprovide charge transport images at temperatures from room to 4 K in\nunconventional superconductors and topologically nontrivial materials.\n", "  We investigate the energy dependence and the internal-state dependence of the\ncharge-exchange collision cross sections in a mixture of $^6$Li atoms and\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions in the collision energy range from 0.2 mK to 1 K.\nDeliberately excited ion micromotion is used to control the collision energy of\natoms and ions. The energy dependence of the charge-exchange collision cross\nsection obeys the Langevin model in the temperature range of the current\nexperiment, and the measured magnitude of the cross section is correlated to\nthe internal state of the $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. Revealing the relationship\nbetween the charge-exchange collision cross sections and the interaction\npotentials is an important step toward the realization of the full quantum\ncontrol of the chemical reactions at an ultralow temperature regime.\n", "  We study the interaction of intense ultrashort laser pulses with cryogenic He\njets using 2d/3v relativistic Particle-in-Cell simulations (XOOPIC). Of\nparticular interest are laser intensities $(10^{15}-10^{20})$ W/cm$^2$, pulse\nlengths $\\le 100$ fs, and the frequency regime $\\sim 800$ nm for which the jets\nare initially transparent and subsequently not homogeneously ionized. Pulses\n$\\ge 10^{16}$ W/cm$^2$ are found to drive ionization along the jet and outside\nthe laser spot, the ionization-front propagates along the jet at a fraction of\nthe speed of light. Within the ionized region, there is a highly transient\nfield, which may be interpreted as two-surface wave decay and as a result of\nthe charge-neutralizing disturbance at the jet-vacuum interface. The ionized\nregion has solid-like densities and temperatures of few to hundreds of eV,\ni.e., warm and hot dense matter regimes. Such extreme conditions are relevant\nfor high-energy densities as found, e.g., in shock-wave experiments and\ninertial confinement fusion studies. The temporal evolution of the ionization\nis studied considering theoretically a pump-probe x-ray Thomson scattering\n(XRTS) scheme. We observe plasmon and non-collective modes that are generated\nin the jet, and their amplitude is proportional to the ionized volume. Our\ntheoretical findings could be tested at free-electron laser facilities such as\nFLASH and the European XFEL (Hamburg) and the LCLS (Stanford).\n", "  By taking advantage of the trace approximation, one can gain an enormous\ncomputational advantage when solving for the global turbulent transport of\nimpurities. In particular, this makes feasible the study of non-Maxwellian\ntransport coupled in radius and energy, allowing collisions and transport to be\naccounted for on similar time scales, as occurs for fast ions. In this work, we\nstudy the fully-nonlinear ITG-driven trace turbulent transport of locally\nheated and injected fast ions. Previous results indicated the existence of\nMeV-range minorities heated by cyclotron resonance, and an associated density\npinch effect. Here, we build upon this result using the t3core code to solve\nfor the distribution of these minorities, consistently including the effects of\ncollisions, gyrokinetic turbulence, and heating. Using the same tool to study\nthe transport of injected fast ions, we contrast the qualitative features of\ntheir transport with that of the heated minorities. Our results indicate that\nheated minorities are more strongly affected by microturbulence than injected\nfast ions. The physical interpretation of this difference provides a possible\nexplanation for the observed synergy when NBI heating is combined with ICRH.\nFurthermore, we move beyond the trace approximation to develop a model which\nallows one to easily account for the reduction of anomalous transport due to\nthe presence of fast ions in electrostatic turbulence.\n", "  Spatial adiabatic passage represents a new way to design integrated photonic\ndevices. In conventional adiabatic passage designs require smoothly varying\nwaveguide separations. Here we show modelling of adiabatic passage devices\nwhere the waveguide separation is varied digitally. Despite digitisation, our\ndesigns show robustness against variations in the input wavelength and\nrefractive index contrast of the waveguides relative to the cladding. This\napproach to spatial adiabatic passage opens new design strategies and hence the\npotential for new photonics devices.\n", "  In recent years, several experiments using magnetic spectrometers provided\nhigh precision results in the field of Hypernuclear Physics. In particular, the\naccurate determination of the Lambda-binding energy, B(Lambda), contributed to\nstimulate considerably the discussion about the Charge Symmetry Breaking effect\nin Lambda-hypernuclei isomultiplets. We have reorganized the results from the\nFINUDA experiment and we have obtained a series of B(Lambda) values for\nLambda-hypernuclei with A <= 16 by taking into account data only from magnetic\nspectrometers implementing an absolute calibration of the energy scale (FINUDA\nat DAFNE and electroproduction experiments at JLab and at MaMi). We have then\ncritically revisited the results obtained at KEK by the SKS Collaboration in\norder to make possible a direct comparison between data from experiments with\nand without such an absolute energy scale. A synopsis of recent spectrometric\nmeasurements of B(Lambda) is presented, including also emulsion experiment\nresults. Several interesting conclusions are drawn, among which the equality\nwithin the errors of B(Lambda) for the A = 7, 12, 16 isomultiplets, based only\non recent spectrometric data. This observation is in nice agreement with a\nrecent theoretical prediction. Ideas for possible new measurements which should\nimprove the present experimental knowledge are finally put forward.\n", "  Detonation propagation in the limit of highly spatially discretized energy\nsources is investigated. The model of this problem begins with a medium\nconsisting of a calorically perfect gas with a prescribed energy release per\nunit mass. The energy release is collected into sheet-like sources that are now\nembedded in an inert gas that fills the spaces between them. The release of\nenergy in the first sheet results in a planar blast wave that propagates to the\nnext source, which is triggered after a prescribed delay, generating a new\nblast, and so forth. The resulting wave dynamics as the front passes through\nhundreds of such sources is computationally simulated by numerically solving\nthe governing one-dimensional Euler equations in the lab-fixed reference frame.\nThe average wave speed for each simulation is measured once the wave\npropagation has reached a quasi-periodic solution. Velocities in excess of the\nCJ speed are found as the sources are made increasingly discrete, with the\ndeviation above CJ being as great as $15\\%$. The total energy release, delay\ntime, and whether the sources remain lab-fixed or are convected with the flow\ndo not have a significant influence on the deviation of the average wave speed\naway from CJ. Such continuous waves can also be shown to have a time-averaged\nstructure consistent with the classical ZND structure of a detonation. In the\nlimit of highly discrete sources, temporal averaging of the wave structure\nshows that the effective sonic surface does not correspond to an equilibrium\nstate. The average state of the flow leaving the wave in this case does\neventually reach the equilibrium Hugoniot, but only after the effective sonic\nsurface has been crossed. Thus, the super-CJ waves observed in the limit of\nhighly discretized sources can be understood as weak detonations due to the\nnon-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface.\n", "  The recently observed two high-spin rotational bands in the proton emitter\n$^{113}$Cs are investigated using the cranked shell model with pairing\ncorrelations treated by a particle-number conserving method, in which the Pauli\nblocking effects are taken into account exactly. By using the configuration\nassignments of band 1 ($\\pi 3/2^+[422], \\alpha = -1/2$) and band 2 ($\\pi\n1/2^+[420], \\alpha = 1/2$), the experimental moments of inertia and\nquasiparticle alignments can be well reproduced by the present calculations,\nwhich in turn strongly support these configuration assignments. Furthermore, by\nanalyzing the occupation probability $n_\\mu$ of each cranked Nilsson level near\nthe Fermi surface and the contribution of each orbital to the angular momentum\nalignments, the backbending mechanism of these two bands is also investigated.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu and CP$^{N-1}$ models in\nthe canonical formalism with fixed $U(1)$ charge. For large-$N$ this is closely\nrelated to coupling the models to abelian Chern-Simons in a monopole\nbackground. We show that the presence of the imaginary chemical potential for\nthe $U(1)$ charge makes the phase structure of the models remarkably similar.\nWe calculate their respective large-$N$ free energy densities and show that\nthey are mapped into each other in a precise way. Intriguingly, the free energy\nmap involves the Bloch-Wigner function and its generalizations introduced by\nZagier. We expect that our results are connected to the recently discussed $3d$\nbosonization.\n", "  In the present paper, quantum speed limit (QSL) time of a bipartite V-type\nthree-level atomic system under the effect of two-qutrit entanglement is\ninvestigated. Each party interacts with own independent reservoir. By\nconsidering two local unitarily equivalent Wener states and the Horodecki PPT\nstate, as initial states, the QSL time is evaluated for each of them in the\nrespective entangled regions. It is counterintu-itively observe that the effect\nof entanglement on the QSL time driven from each of the initial Werner states\nare completely different when the degree of non-Markovianity is considerable.\nIn addition, it is interesting that the effect of entanglement of the\nnon-equivalent Horodecki state on the calculated QSL time displays an\nintermediate behavior relative to the cases obtained for the Werner states.\n", "  We report the multi-scale modeling and design of a gate-defined\nsingle-electron transistor in a MoS$_{2}$ bilayer. By combining\ndensity-functional theory and finite-element analysis, we design a surface gate\nstructure to electrostatically define and tune a quantum dot and its associated\ntunnel barriers in the MoS$_{2}$ bilayer. Our approach suggests new pathways\nfor the creation of novel quantum electronic devices in two-dimensional\nmaterials.\n", "  Information geometrical structure $(g^{(D_\\alpha)},\n\\nabla^{(D_\\alpha)},\\nabla^{(D_\\alpha)*})$ induced from the sandwiched R\\'enyi\n$\\alpha$-divergence $D_\\alpha(\\rho\\|\\sigma):=\\frac{1}{\\alpha\n(\\alpha-1)}\\log\\,{\\rm Tr}\n\\left(\\sigma^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{2\\alpha}}\\rho\\,\\sigma^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{2\\alpha}}\\right)^{\\alpha}$\non a finite quantum state space $\\mathcal{S}$ is studied. It is shown that the\nRiemannian metric $g^{(D_\\alpha)}$ is monotone if and only if\n$\\alpha\\in(-\\infty, -1]\\cup [\\frac{1}{2},\\infty)$, and that the quantum\nstatistical manifold $({\\mathcal{S}}, g^{(D_\\alpha)},\n\\nabla^{(D_\\alpha)},\\nabla^{(D_\\alpha)*})$ is dually flat if and only if\n$\\alpha=1$.\n", "  Low-cost coin vibrational motors, used in haptic feedback, exhibit rotational\ninternal motion inside a rigid case. Because the motor case motion exhibits\nrotational symmetry, when placed into a fluid such as glycerin, the motor does\nnot swim even though its vibrations induce steady streaming in the fluid.\nHowever, a piece of rubber foam stuck to the curved case and giving the motor\nneutral buoyancy also breaks the rotational symmetry allowing it to swim. We\nmeasured a 1 cm diameter coin vibrational motor swimming in glycerin at a speed\nof a body length in 3 seconds or at 3 mm/s. The swim speed puts the vibrational\nmotor in a low Reynolds number regime similar to bacterial motility, but\nbecause of the vibration it is not analogous to biological organisms. Rather\nthe swimming vibrational motor may inspire small inexpensive robotic swimmers\nthat are robust as they contain no external moving parts. A time dependent\nStokes equation planar sheet model suggests that the swim speed depends on a\nsteady streaming velocity $V_{stream} \\sim Re_s^{1/2} U_0$ where $U_0$ is the\nvelocity of surface vibrations, and streaming Reynolds number $Re_s =\nU_0^2/(\\omega \\nu)$ for angular vibrational frequency $\\omega$ and fluid\nkinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n", "  In this comment, we agree with the formulas derived in Refs. [1,2] but show\nthat the results are not due to \"interference between spatially separated\nstates of the center of mass of a mesoscopic harmonic oscillator\".\n", "  In the case of underground experiments for neutrino physics or rare event\nsearches, the background caused by cosmic muons contributes significantly and\ntherefore must be identified and rejected. We proposed and optimized a new\ndetector using liquid scintillator with wavelenghth-shifting fibers which can\nbe employed as a veto detector for cosmic muons background rejection. From the\nprototype study, it has been found that the detector has good performances and\nis capable of discriminating between muons induced signals and environmental\nradiation background. Its muons detection efficiency is greater than 98$\\%$,\nand on average, 58 photo-electrons (p.e.) are collected when a muon passes\nthrough the detector. To optimize the design and enhance the collection of\nlight, the reflectivity of the coating materials has been studied in detail. A\nMonte Carlo simulation of the detector has been developed and compared to the\nperformed measurements showing a good agreement between data and simulation\nresults.\n", "  The $\\mu\\nu$SSM solves the $\\mu$ problem of supersymmetric models and\nreproduces neutrino data, simply using couplings with right-handed neutrinos\n$\\nu$'s. Given that these couplings break explicitly $R$ parity, the gravitino\nis a natural candidate for decaying dark matter in the $\\mu \\nu$SSM. In this\nwork we carry out a complete analysis of the detection of $\\mu \\nu$SSM\ngravitino dark matter through $\\gamma$-ray observations. In addition to the\ntwo-body decay producing a sharp line, we include in the analysis the\nthree-body decays producing a smooth spectral signature. We perform first a\ndeep exploration of the low-energy parameter space of the $\\mu \\nu$SSM taking\ninto account that neutrino data must be reproduced. Then, we compare the\n$\\gamma$-ray fluxes predicted by the model with Fermi-LAT observations. In\nparticular, with the 95$\\%$ CL upper limits on the total diffuse extragalactic\n$\\gamma$-ray background using 50 months of data, together with the upper limits\non line emission from an updated analysis using 69.9 months of data. For\nstandard values of bino and wino masses, gravitinos with masses larger than\nabout 4 GeV, or lifetimes smaller than $10^{28}$ s, produce too large fluxes\nand are excluded as dark matter candidates. However, when limiting scenarios\nwith large and close values of the gaugino masses are considered, the\nconstraints turn out to be less stringent, excluding masses larger than 17 GeV\nand lifetimes smaller than $4\\times 10^{25}$ s.\n", "  Electric weak links, the term used for those parts of an electrical circuit\nthat provide most of the resistance against the flow of an electrical current,\nare important elements of many nanodevices. Quantum dots, nanowires and\nnano-constrictions that bridge two bulk conductors (or superconductors) are\nexamples of such weak links. Here we consider nanostructures where the\nelectronic spin-orbit interaction is strong in the weak link but is unimportant\nin the bulk conductors, and explore theoretically the role of the spin-orbit\nactive weak link (which we call a \"Rashba spin splitter\") as a source of new\nspin-based functionality in both normal and superconducting devices. Some\nrecently predicted phenomena, including mechanically-controlled spin- and\ncharge currents as well as the effect of spin polarization of superconducting\nCooper pairs, are reviewed.\n", "  As of 2023, the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array will go\nonline in Australia. It will constitute the largest and most powerful\nlow-frequency radio-astronomical observatory to date, and will facilitate a\nrich science programme in astronomy and astrophysics. With modest engineering\nchanges, it will also be able to measure cosmic rays via the radio emission\nfrom extensive air showers. The extreme antenna density and the homogeneous\ncoverage provided by more than 60,000 antennas within an area of one km$^2$\nwill push radio detection of cosmic rays in the energy range around 10$^{17}$\neV to ultimate precision, with superior capabilities in the reconstruction of\narrival direction, energy, and an expected depth-of-shower-maximum resolution\nof 6~g/cm${^2}$.\n", "  The geometry and intrinsic ellipticity distribution of ultra diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs) is determined from the line-of-sight distribution of axial ratios q of a\nlarge sample of UDGs, detected by Koda et al. (2015) in the Coma cluster. With\nhigh significance the data rules out an oblate, disk-like geometry,\ncharacterised by major axi a=b>c. The data is however in good agreement with\nprolate shapes, corresponding to a=b<c. This indicates that UDGs are not\nthickened, rotating, axisymmetric disks, puffed up by violent processes.\nInstead they are anisotropic elongated cigar- or bar-like structures, similar\nto the prolate dwarf spheroidal galaxy population of the Local Group. The\nintrinsic distribution of axial ratios of the Coma UDGs is flat in the range of\n0.4 <= a/c <= 0.9 which will provide important constraints for theoretical\nmodels of their origin. Formation scenarios that could explain the extended\nprolate nature of UDGs are discussed.\n", "  Theoretically, rotation-induced chemical mixing in massive stars has far\nreaching evolutionary consequences, affecting the sequence of morphological\nphases, lifetimes, nucleosynthesis, and supernova characteristics. Using a\nsample of 72 presumably single O-type giants to supergiants observed in the\ncontext of the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we aim to investigate\nrotational mixing in evolved core-hydrogen burning stars initially more massive\nthan $15\\,M_\\odot$ by analysing their surface nitrogen abundances. Using\nstellar and wind properties derived in a previous VFTS study, we constrained\nthe nitrogen abundance by fitting the equivalent widths of relatively strong\nlines that are sensitive to changes in the abundance of this element. Given the\nquality of the data, we constrained the nitrogen abundance in 38 cases; for 34\nstars only upper limits could be derived, which includes almost all stars\nrotating at $v_\\mathrm{e}\\sin i >200\\,\\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. We analysed the\nnitrogen abundance as a function of projected rotation rate $v_\\mathrm{e}\\sin\ni$ and confronted it with predictions of rotational mixing. The upper limits on\nthe nitrogen abundance of the rapidly rotating stars are not in apparent\nviolation with theoretical expectations. However, we found a group of\nN-enhanced slowly-spinning stars that is not in accordance with predictions of\nrotational mixing in single stars. Among O-type stars with (rotation-corrected)\ngravities less than $\\log\\,g_c = 3.75$ this group constitutes 30$-$40 percent\nof the population. We found a correlation between nitrogen and helium abundance\nwhich is consistent with expectations, suggesting that, whatever the mechanism\nthat brings N to the surface, it displays CNO-processed material.\n", "  Marginal stability arguments are used to describe the rotation-number\ndependence of torque in Taylor-Couette (TC) flow for radius ratios $\\eta \\geq\n0.9$ and shear Reynolds number $Re_S=2\\times 10^4$. With an approximate\nrepresentation of the mean profile by piecewise linear functions, characterized\nby the boundary-layer thicknesses at the inner and outer cylinder and the\nangular momentum in the center, profiles and torques are extracted from the\nrequirement that the boundary layers represent marginally stable TC subsystems\nand that the torque at the inner and outer cylinder coincide. This model then\nexplains the broad shoulder in the torque as a function of rotation number near\n$R_\\Omega\\approx 0.2$. For rotation numbers $R_\\Omega < 0.07$ the TC stability\nconditions predict boundary layers in which shear Reynolds numbers are very\nlarge. Assuming that the TC instability is bypassed by some shear instability,\na second maximum in torque appears, in very good agreement with numerical\nsimulations. The results show that, despite the shortcomings of marginal\nstability theory in other cases, it can explain quantitatively the\nnon-monotonic torque variation with rotation number for both the broad maximum\nas well as the narrow maximum.\n", "  Depending on deformed canonical anti-commutation relations, massless neutrino\noscillation based on Lorentz invariance violation in non-commutative field\ntheory is discussed. It is found that the previous studies about massless\nneutrino oscillation within deformed canonical anti-commutation relations\nshould satisfy the condition of new Moyal product and new non standard\ncommutation relations. Furthermore, comparing the Lorentz Invariant Violation\nparameters $\\mathit{A}$ in the previous studies with new Moyal product and new\nnon standard commutation relations, we find that the orders of magnitude of\nnon-commutative parameters (Lorentz invariant Violation parameters\n$\\mathit{A}$) is not self-consistent. This inconsistency means that the\nprevious studies of Lorentz invariance violation in non-commutative field\ntheory may not naturally explain massless neutrino oscillation. In other words,\nit should be impossible to explain neutrino oscillation by Lorentz invariance\nviolation in non-commutative field theory. This conclusion is supported by the\nlatest atmospheric neutrinos experimental results from the Super-Kamiokande\nCollaboration, which show that no evidence of Lorentz invariance violation on\natmospheric neutrinos was observed.\n", "  Nonleptonic weak decays of Xi_c into pi^+ and a meson (M)-baryon (B) final\nstate, MB, are analyzed from the viewpoint of probing S=-2 baryon resonances,\ni.e. Xi(1620) and Xi(1690), of which spin-parity and other properties are not\nwell known. We argue that the weak decay of Xi_c is dominated by a single\nquark-line diagram, preferred by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa coefficient,\ncolor recombination factor, the diquark correlation, and the kinematical\ncondition. The decay process has an advantage of being free from meson\nresonances in the pi^+M invariant mass distribution. The invariant mass\ndistribution of the meson-baryon final state is calculated with three different\nchiral unitary approaches, assuming that the Xi(1620) and Xi(1690) resonances\nhave J^P=1/2^-. It is found that a clear peak for the Xi(1690) is seen in the\npiXi and KbarLambda spectra. We also suggest that the ratios of the piXi,\nKbarLambda and KbarSigma final states are useful to distinguish whether the\npeak is originated from the Xi(1690) resonance or it is a KbarSigma threshold\neffect.\n", "  The adiabatic limit of a recently proposed dynamical extension of Taylor\nrelaxation, \\emph{multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics} (MRxMHD) is\nsummarized, with special attention to the appropriate definition of relative\nmagnetic helicity. The formalism is illustrated using a simple two-region,\nsheared-magnetic-field model similar to the Hahm--Kulsrud--Taylor (HKT)\nrippled-boundary slab model. In MRxMHD a linear Grad--Shafranov equation\napplies, even at finite ripple amplitude. The adiabatic switching on of\nboundary ripple excites a shielding current sheet opposing reconnection at a\nresonant surface. The perturbed magnetic field as a function of ripple\namplitude is calculated by invoking conservation of magnetic helicity in the\ntwo regions separated by the current sheet. At low ripple amplitude \"half\nislands\" appear on each side of the current sheet, locking the rotational\ntransform at the resonant value. Beyond a critical amplitude these islands\ndisappear and the rotational transform develops a discontinuity across the\ncurrent sheet.\n", "  Simulated annealing (SA) is applied for three-dimensional (3D) equilibrium\ncalculation of ideal, low-beta reduced MHD in cylindrical geometry. The SA is\nbased on the theory of Hamiltonian mechanics. The dynamical equation of the\noriginal system, low-beta reduced MHD in this study, is modified so that the\nenergy changes monotonically while preserving the Casimir invariants in the\nartificial dynamics. An equilibrium of the system is given by an extremum of\nthe energy, therefore SA can be used as a method for calculating ideal MHD\nequilibrium. Previous studies demonstrated that the SA succeeds to lead to\nvarious MHD equilibria in two dimensional rectangular domain. In this paper,\nthe theory is applied to 3D equilibrium of ideal, low-beta reduced MHD. An\nexample of equilibrium with magnetic islands, obtained as a lower energy state,\nis shown. Several versions of the artificial dynamics are developed that can\neffect smoothing.\n", "  We study the SL(2,C) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients appearing in the lorentzian\nEPRL spin foam amplitudes for loop quantum gravity. We show how the amplitudes\ndecompose into SU(2) nj-symbols at the vertices and integrals over boosts at\nthe edges. The integrals define edge amplitudes that can be evaluated\nanalytically using and adapting results in the literature, leading to a pure\nstate sum model formulation. This procedure introduces virtual representations\nwhich, in a manner reminiscent to virtual momenta in Feynman amplitudes, are\noff-shell of the simplicity constraints present in the theory, but with the\nintegrands that peak at the on-shell values. We point out some properties of\nthe edge amplitudes which are helpful for numerical and analytical evaluations\nof spin foam amplitudes, and suggest among other things a simpler model useful\nfor calculations of certain lowest order amplitudes. As an application, we\nestimate the large spin scaling behaviour of the simpler model, on a closed\nfoam with all 4-valent edges and Euler characteristic X, to be N^(X - 5E +\nV/2). The paper contains a review and an extension of results on SL(2,C)\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients among unitary representations of the principal\nseries that can be useful beyond their application to quantum gravity\nconsidered here.\n", "  The generation of temporal cavity solitons in microresonators results in\nlow-noise optical frequency combs which are critical for applications in\nspectroscopy, astronomy, navigation or telecommunications. Breather solitons\nalso form an important part of many different classes of nonlinear wave systems\nwith a localized temporal structure that exhibits oscillatory behavior. To\ndate, the dynamics of breather solitons in microresonators remains largely\nunexplored, and its experimental characterization is challenging. Here, we\ndemonstrate the excitation of breather solitons in two different microresonator\nplatforms based on silicon nitride and on silicon. We investigate the\ndependence of the breathing frequency on pump detuning and observe the\ntransition from period-1 to period-2 oscillation in good agreement with the\nnumerical simulations. Our study presents experimental confirmation of the\nstability diagram of dissipative cavity solitons predicted by the\nLugiato-Lefever equation and is importance to understanding the fundamental\ndynamical properties of solitons within the larger context of nonlinear\nscience.\n", "  The collapse scenario of a scalar field along with a perfect fluid\ndistribution is investigated for a conformally flat spacetime. The theorem for\nthe integrability of an anharmonic oscillator has been utilized. For a pure\npower law potential of the form ${\\phi}^{n+1}$, it is found that a central\nsingularity is formed which is covered by an apparent horizon for $n>0$ and\n$n<-3$. Some numerical results have also been presented for a combination of\ntwo different powers of $\\phi$ in the potential.\n", "  We show that Wigner semi-circle law holds for Hermitian matrices with\ndependent entries, provided the deviation of the cumulants from the normalised\nGaussian case obeys a simple power law bound in the size of the matrix. To\nestablish this result, we use replicas interpreted as a zero-dimensional\nquantum field theoretical model whose effective potential obey a\nrenormalisation group equation.\n", "  We implement faster-than-adiabatic two-qubit phase gates using smooth\nstate-dependent forces. The forces are designed to leave no final motional\nexcitation, independently of the initial motional state in the harmonic,\nsmall-oscillations limit. They are simple, explicit functions of time and the\ndesired logical phase of the gate, and are based on quadratic invariants of\nmotion and Lewis-Riesenfeld phases of the normal modes.\n", "  We implement a robust, globally convergent root search method for\ntranscendental equations guaranteed to locate all complex roots within a\nspecified search domain, based on Cauchy's residue theorem. Although several\nimplementations of the argument principle already exist, ours has several\nadvantages: it allows singularities within the search domain and branch points\nare not fatal to the method. Furthermore, our implementation is simple and is\nwritten in MATLAB, fulfilling the need for an easily integrated implementation\nwhich can be readily modified to accommodate the many variations of the\nargument principle method, each of which is suited to a different application.\nWe apply the method to the step index fiber dispersion relation, which has\nbecome topical due to the recent proliferation of high index contrast fibers.\nWe also find modes with permittivity as the eigenvalue, catering to recent\nnumerical methods that expand the radiation of sources by eigenmodes.\n", "  Allostery plays a fundament role in most biological processes. However,\nlittle theory is available to describe it outside of two-state models. Here we\nuse a statistical mechanical approach to show that the allosteric coupling\nbetween two collective variables is not a single number, but instead a\ntwo-dimensional thermodynamic coupling function that is directly related to the\nmutual information from information theory and the copula density function from\nprobability theory. On this basis, we demonstrate how to quantify the\ncontribution of specific energy terms to this thermodynamic coupling function,\nenabling a decomposition that reveals the mechanism of allostery. We illustrate\nthe thermodynamic coupling function and its use by showing how allosteric\ncoupling in the alanine dipeptide molecule contributes to the overall shape of\nthe {\\Phi}/{\\Psi} free energy surface, and by identifying the interactions that\nare necessary for this coupling.\n", "  We consider the estimation of noise parameters in a quantum channel, assuming\nthe most general strategy allowed by quantum mechanics. This is based on the\nexploitation of unlimited entanglement and arbitrary quantum operations, so\nthat the channel inputs may be interactively updated. In this general scenario\nwe draw a novel connection between quantum metrology and teleportation. In\nfact, for any teleportation-covariant channel (e.g., Pauli, erasure, or\nGaussian channel), we find that adaptive noise estimation cannot beat the\nstandard quantum limit, with the quantum Fisher information being determined by\nthe channel's Choi matrix. As an example, we establish the ultimate precision\nfor estimating excess noise in a thermal-loss channel which is crucial for\nquantum cryptography. Because our general methodology applies to any functional\nwhich is monotonic under trace-preserving maps, it can be applied to simplify\nother adaptive protocols, including those for quantum channel discrimination.\nSetting the ultimate limits for noise estimation and discrimination paves the\nway for exploring the boundaries of quantum sensing, imaging and tomography.\n", "  The quantum mechanical propagator of a massive particle in a linear\ngravitational potential derived already in 1927 by Earle H. Kennard\n\\cite{Kennard,Kennard2} contains a phase that scales with the third power of\nthe time $T$ during which the particle experiences the corresponding force.\nSince in conventional atom interferometers the internal atomic states are all\nexposed to the same acceleration $a$, this $T^3$-phase cancels out and the\ninterferometer phase scales as $T^2$. In contrast, by applying an external\nmagnetic field we prepare two different accelerations $a_1$ and $a_2$ for two\ninternal states of the atom, which translate themselves into two different\ncubic phases and the resulting interferometer phase scales as $T^3$. We present\nthe theoretical background for, and summarize our progress towards\nexperimentally realizing such a novel atom interferometer.\n", "  A study of \"high temperature\" entangled states in a system of two\nparametrically coupled quantum oscillators placed into independent thermal\nbaths is performed taking into account partially coherent parametric pump.\nProcesses in an open system are considered based on the Heisenberg-Langevin\nformalism. We obtain a closed system of equations for the averaged quadratic\ncorrelation functions in quantum stochastic problem as a result of Markov\nprocesses approximation. On the basis of numerical calculations the dynamics of\nthe logarithmic negativity, which is the measure of entanglement in the system,\nis investigated. It is shown that the partial coherence of the parametric pump\nmakes the lifetime of the entangled states finite. The threshold\ncharacteristics of the formation and existence of these states are specified.\n", "  The predator/prey (capture) problem is a prototype of many network-related\napplications. We study the capture process on complex networks by considering\nmultiple predators from multiple sources. In our model, some lions start from\nmultiple sources simultaneously to capture the lamb by biased random walks,\nwhich are controlled with a free parameter $\\alpha$. We derive the distribution\nof the lamb's lifetime and the expected lifetime $\\left\\langle T\\right\\rangle\n$. Through simulation, we find that the expected lifetime drops substantially\nwith the increasing number of lions. We also study how the underlying\ntopological structure affects the capture process, and obtain that locating on\nsmall-degree nodes is better than large-degree nodes to prolong the lifetime of\nthe lamb. Moreover, dense or homogeneous network structures are against the\nsurvival of the lamb.\n", "  This paper presents a novel method for quantifying axonal density and\ndiameter using simple multiple gradient echo (MGE) MRI\n", "  We study the universality of the three-body parameters for systems relevant\nfor ultracold quantum gases with positive $s$-wave two-body scattering lengths.\nOur results account for finite-range effects and their universality is tested\nby changing the number of deeply bound diatomic states supported by our\ninteraction model. We find that the physics controlling the values of the\nthree-body parameters associated with the ground and excited Efimov states is\nconstrained by a variational principle and can be strongly affected by $d$-wave\ninteractions that prevent both trimer states from merging into the atom-dimer\ncontinuum. Our results enable comparisons to current experimental data and they\nsuggest tests of universality for atomic systems with{positive scattering\nlengths.\n", "  We introduce a model which may generate particle number asymmetry in an\nexpanding Universe. The model includes CP violating and particle number\nviolating interactions. The model consists of a real scalar field and a complex\nscalar field. Starting with an initial condition specified by a density matrix,\nwe show how the asymmetry is created through the interaction and how it evolves\nat later time. We compute the asymmetry using non-equilibrium quantum field\ntheory and as a first test of the model, we study how the asymmetry evolves in\nthe flat limit.\n", "  We apply the worldline formalism to scalar quantum electrodynamics (QED) to\nfind a Bern-Kosower type master formula for generalized Compton scattering,\non-shell and off-shell. Moreover, we use it to study the non-perturbative gauge\nparameter dependence of amplitudes in scalar QED and, as our main result, find\na simple non-perturbative transformation rule under changes of this parameter\nin x-space in terms of conformal cross ratios. This generalizes the well-known\nLandau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation (LKFT). We also exemplify how the\nLKFT works in perturbation theory.\n", "  We consider the adiabatic limit of Hadamard states for free quantum\nKlein-Gordon fields, when the background metric and the field mass are slowly\nvaried from their initial to final values. If the Klein-Gordon field stays\nmassive, we prove that the adiabatic limit of the initial vacuum state is the\n(final) vacuum state, by extending to the symplectic framework the adiabatic\ntheorem of Avron-Seiler-Yaffe. In cases when only the field mass is varied,\nusing a abstract version of the mode decomposition method we can also consider\nthe case when the initial or final mass vanishes, and the initial state is\neither a thermal state or a more general Hadamard state.\n", "  With the newest version of our Monte Carlo code for ultra-high-energy cosmic\nray (UHECR) propagation, CRPropa 3, the flux of neutrinos and photons due to\ninteractions of UHECRs with extragalactic background light can be predicted.\nTogether with the recently updated data for the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray\nbackground (IGRB) by Fermi LAT, it is now possible to severely constrain UHECR\nsource models. The evolution of the UHECR sources especially plays an important\nrole in the determination of the expected secondary photon spectrum. Pure\nproton UHECR models are already strongly constrained, primarily by the highest\nenergy bins of Fermi LAT's IGRB, as long as their number density is not\nstrongly peaked at recent times.\n", "  The infinite families of Peregrine, Akhmediev and Kuznetsov-Ma breather\nsolutions of the focusing Nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation are obtained\nvia a matrix version of the Darboux transformation, with a spectral matrix of\nthe form of a Jordan block. The structure of these solutions is essentially\ndetermined by the corresponding solution of the Lyapunov equation. In\nparticular, regularity follows from properties of the Lyapunov equation.\n", "  It is shown that electromagnetic potentials convey physical information\nbeyond that supplied by electric and magnetic fields alone, and are thus more\nfundamental. Observable physical properties can impose conditions on the\nselection of electromagnetic gauge (i.e. sets of potentials) that are explicit\nand restrictive. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. The\nimplication that the choice of gauge carries physical information is confirmed\nby exhibiting a set of potentials that describes fields correctly, but that\nviolates physical constraints. The basic conclusions are that physical\nrequirements place limits on acceptable gauges; and that potentials are more\nfundamental than fields in both classical and quantum physics, representing a\nmajor generalization of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect. These important\nproperties are obscured if the dipole approximation is employed. The properties\ndemonstrated here relate directly to conditions that exist in strong-field\nlaser applications.\n", "  Integrated optical power splitter is one of the fundamental building blocks\nin photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Conventional multimode interferometer\nbased power splitter is widely used as it has reasonable footprint and is easy\nto fabricate. However, it is challenging to realize arbitrary split ratio\nespecially for multi-outputs. In this work, an ultra-compact power splitter\nwith a QR code-like nanostructure is designed by a nonlinear fast search method\n(FSM). The highly functional structure is composed of a number of freely\ndesigned square pixels with the size of 120nm x 120nm which could be either\ndielectric or air. The lightwaves are scattered by a number of etched squares\nwith optimized locations and the scattered waves superimpose at the outputs\nwith the desired power ratio. We demonstrate 1x2 splitters with 1:1, 1:2, 1:3\nsplit ratios and a 1x3 splitter with the ratio of 1:2:1. The footprint for all\nthe devices is only 3.6umx3.6 um. Well-controlled split ratios are measured for\nall the cases. The measured transmission efficiencies of all the splitters are\nclose to 80% over 30 nm wavelength range.\n", "  We present a set of 87 RAVE stars with detected solar like oscillations,\nobserved during Campaign 1 of the K2 mission (RAVE K2-C1 sample). This dataset\nprovides a useful benchmark for testing the gravities provided in RAVE Data\nRelease 4 (DR4), and is key for the calibration of the RAVE Data Release 5\n(DR5). In the present work, we use two different pipelines, GAUFRE (Valentini\net al. 2013) and Sp_Ace (Boeche & Grebel 2016), to determine atmospheric\nparameters and abundances by fixing log(g) to the seismic one. Our strategy\nensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more\naccurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained\nhere with and without the use of seismic log(g) information has shown that an\nunderestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated\n(overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by ~0.25 dex\nwhen the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison\nbetween the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the\nRAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log(g) of RAVE giants in the\ncolour interval 0.50<(J - Ks)<0.85. Finally, we show a comparison of the\ndistances, temperatures, extinctions (and ages) derived here for our RAVE K2-C1\nsample with those derived in RAVE DR4 and DR5.DR5 performs better than DR4\nthanks to the seismic calibration, although discrepancies can still be\nimportant for objects for which the difference between DR4/DR5 and seismic\ngravities differ by more than ~0.5 dex. The method illustrated in this work\nwill be used for analysing RAVE targets present in the other K2 campaigns, in\nthe framework of Galactic Archaeology investigations.\n", "  It is shown that the excellent scaling of the elliptic flow found for all\ncentralities, species and energies from RHIC to the LHC for $p_{T}$ less than\nthe saturation momentum is a consequence of the energy lost by a parton\ninteracting with the color field produced in a nucleus-nucleus collision. In\nparticular, the deduced shape of the scaling curve describes correctly all the\ndata. We discuss the possible extensions to higher $p_{T}$, proton-nucleus and\nproton-proton collisions as well as higher harmonics.\n", "  We consider diffusion caused by a combined influence of the electric current\nand the Hall effect, and argue that such diffusion can form inhomogeneities of\nthe chemical composition in plasma. The considered mechanism can be responsible\nfor a formation of element spots in laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. This\ncurrent-driven diffusion can be accompanied by propagation of a particular type\nwaves in which the impurity number density oscillate alone. These compositional\nwaves exist if the magnetic pressure in plasma is much greater than the gas\npressure,\n", "  Compositional convection is thought to be an important energy source for\nmagnetic field generation within planetary interiors. The Prandtl number, $Pr$,\ncharacterizing compositional convection is significantly larger than unity,\nsuggesting that the inertial force may not be important on the small scales of\nconvection as long as the buoyancy force is not too strong. We develop\nasymptotic dynamo models for the case of small Rossby number and large Prandtl\nnumber in which inertia is absent on the convective scale. The relevant\ndiffusivity parameter for this limit is the compositional Roberts number, $q =\nD/\\eta$, which is the ratio of compositional and magnetic diffusivities. Dynamo\nmodels are developed for both order one $q$ and the more geophysically relevant\nlow $q$ limit. For both cases the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy\ndensities, $M$, is asymptotically large and reflects the fact that Alfv\\'en\nwaves have been filtered from the dynamics. Along with previous investigations\nof asymptotic dynamo models for $Pr=O(1)$, our results show that the ratio $M$\nis not a useful indicator of dominant force balances in the momentum equation\nsince many different asymptotic limits of $M$ can be obtained without changing\nthe leading order geostrophic balance. Furthermore, the present models show\nthat inertia is not a requirement for driving low $q$, large-scale dynamos.\n", "  The determination of exoplanet properties and occurrence rates using Kepler\ndata critically depends on our knowledge of the fundamental properties (such as\ntemperature, radius and mass) of the observed stars. We present revised stellar\nproperties for 197,096 Kepler targets observed between Quarters 1-17 (Q1-17),\nwhich were used for the final transiting planet search run by the Kepler\nMission (Data Release 25, DR25). Similar to the Q1--16 catalog by Huber et al.\nthe classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters\non a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted\nmethodology and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities or\nmetallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties the new catalog\nalso includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for\neach stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are ~27% in radius,\n~17% in mass, and ~51% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous\ncatalogs due to the larger number of improved logg constraints and the\ninclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions.\nOn average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved\nsolar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5% in the number of subgiants. We\ndiscuss the overall changes of radii and masses of Kepler targets as a function\nof spectral type, with particular focus on exoplanet host stars.\n", "  Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) is a framework for modeling the\ninfrared structure of theories whose long distance behavior is dominated by\nsoft and collinear divergences. This paper demonstrates that SCET can be made\ncompatible with supersymmetry (SUSY). Explicitly, the effective Lagrangian for\n$\\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills is constructed and shown to be a complete\ndescription for the infrared of this model. For contrast, we also construct the\neffective Lagrangian for chiral SUSY theories with Yukawa couplings,\nspecifically the single flavor Wess-Zumino model. Only a subset of the infrared\ndivergences are reproduced by the Lagrangian -- to account for the complete low\nenergy description requires the inclusion of local operators. SCET is\nformulated by expanding fields along a light-like direction and then\nsubsequently integrating out degrees-of-freedom that are away from the\nlight-cone. Defining the theory with respect to a specific frame obfuscates\nLorentz invariance -- given that SUSY is a space-time symmetry, this presents a\npossible obstruction. The cleanest language with which to expose the congruence\nbetween SUSY and SCET requires exploring two novel formalisms: collinear\nfermions as two-component Weyl spinors, and SCET in light-cone gauge. By\nexpressing SUSY Yang-Mills in \"collinear superspace\", a slice of superspace\nderived by integrating out half the fermionic coordinates, the light-cone gauge\nSUSY SCET theory can be written in terms of superfields. As a byproduct,\nbootstrapping up to the full theory yields the first algorithmic approach for\ndetermining the SUSY Yang-Mills on-shell superspace action. This work paves the\nway toward discovering the effective theory for the collinear limit of\n$\\mathcal{N} = 4$ SUSY Yang-Mills.\n", "  The classical equations of motion for an axion with potential\n$V(\\phi)=m_a^2f_a^2 [1-\\cos (\\phi/f_a)]$ possess quasi-stable, localized,\noscillating solutions, which we refer to as \"axion stars\". We study, for the\nfirst time, collapse of axion stars numerically using the full non-linear\nEinstein equations of general relativity and the full non-perturbative cosine\npotential. We map regions on an \"axion star stability diagram\", parameterized\nby the initial ADM mass, $M_{\\rm ADM}$, and axion decay constant, $f_a$. We\nidentify three regions of the parameter space: i) long-lived oscillating axion\nstar solutions, with a base frequency, $m_a$, modulated by self-interactions,\nii) collapse to a BH and iii) complete dispersal due to gravitational cooling\nand interactions. We locate the boundaries of these three regions and an\napproximate \"triple point\" $(M_{\\rm TP},f_{\\rm TP})\\sim (2.4 M_{pl}^2/m_a,0.3\nM_{pl})$. For $f_a$ below the triple point BH formation proceeds during winding\n(in the complex $U(1)$ picture) of the axion field near the dispersal phase.\nThis could prevent astrophysical BH formation from axion stars with $f_a\\ll\nM_{pl}$. For larger $f_a\\gtrsim f_{\\rm TP}$, BH formation occurs through the\nstable branch and we estimate the mass ratio of the BH to the stable state at\nthe phase boundary to be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ within numerical uncertainty. We\ndiscuss the observational relevance of our findings for axion stars as BH\nseeds, which are supermassive in the case of ultralight axions. For the QCD\naxion, the typical BH mass formed from axion star collapse is $M_{\\rm BH}\\sim\n3.4 (f_a/0.6 M_{pl})^{1.2} M_\\odot$.\n", "  Future multi-functional hybrid devices might combine switchable molecules and\n2D material-based devices. Spin-crossover compounds are of particular interest\nin this context since they exhibit bistability and memory effects at room\ntemperature while responding to numerous external stimuli. Atomically-thin 2D\nmaterials such as graphene attract a lot of attention for their fascinating\nelectrical, optical, and mechanical properties, but also for their reliability\nfor room-temperature operations. Here, we demonstrate that thermally-induced\nspin-state switching of spin-crossover nanoparticle thin films can be monitored\nthrough the electrical transport properties of graphene lying underneath the\nfilms. Model calculations indicate that the charge carrier scattering mechanism\nin graphene is sensitive to the spin-state dependence of the relative\ndielectric constants of the spin-crossover nanoparticles. This graphene sensor\napproach can be applied to a wide class of (molecular) systems with tunable\nelectronic polarizabilities.\n", "  Exchange-correlation hole is a central concept in density functional theory.\nIt not only provides justification for an exchange-correlation energy\nfunctional, but also serves as a local ingredient in nonlocal range-separation\ndensity functional. However, due to the nonlocal nature, modelig the\nconventional exact exchange hole presents a great challenge to density\nfunctional theory. In this work, we propose a semilocal exchange hole\nunderlying the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) meta-GGA functional. The\npresent model is distinct from previous models at small separation between an\nelectron and the hole around the electron. It is also different in the way it\ninterpolates between the rapidly varying iso-orbital density and the slowly\nvarying density, which is determined by the wave vector analysis based on the\nexactly solvable infinite barrier model for jellium surface. Our numerical\ntests show that the exchange hole generated from this model mimics the\nconventional exact exchange hole quite well for atoms. Finally, as a simple\napplication, we apply the hole model to construct a TPSS-based range-separation\nfunctional. Our tests show that this TPSS-based range-separation functional can\nsubstantially improve TPSS band gaps and barrier heights, without losing much\naccuracy of molecular atomization energies.\n", "  We consider a universe with a bulk viscous cosmic fluid, in a flat\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. We derive the conditions for the\nexistence of inflation, and those which at the same time prevent the occurrence\nof self-reproduction. Our theoretical model gives results which are in perfect\nagreement with the most recent data from the PLANCK surveyor.\n", "  The time evolution governed by the Boltzmann kinetic equation is compatible\nwith mechanics and thermodynamics. The former compatibility is mathematically\nexpressed in the Hamiltonian and Godunov structures, the latter in the\nstructure of gradient dynamics guaranteeing the growth of entropy and\nconsequently the approach to equilibrium. We carry all three structures to the\nGrad reformulation of the Boltzmann equation (to the Grad hierarchy). First, we\nrecognize the structures in the infinite Grad hierarchy and then in several\nexamples of finite hierarchies representing extended hydrodynamic equations. In\nthe context of Grad's hierarchies we also investigate relations between\nHamiltonian and Godunov structures.\n", "  SF$_{6}$ is an inert and electronegative gas that has a long history of use\nin high voltage insulation and numerous other industrial applications. Although\nSF$_{6}$ is used as a trace component to introduce stability in tracking\nchambers, its highly electronegative properties have limited its use in\ntracking detectors. In this work we present a series of measurements with\nSF$_{6}$ as the primary gas in a low pressure Time Projection Chamber (TPC),\nwith a thick GEM used as the avalanche and readout device. The first results of\nan $^{55}$Fe energy spectrum in SF$_{6}$ are presented. Measurements of the\nmobility and longitudinal diffusion confirm the negative ion drift of SF$_{6}$.\nHowever, the observed waveforms have a peculiar but interesting structure that\nindicates multiple drift species and a dependence on the reduced field ($E/p$),\nas well as on the level of water vapor contamination. The discovery of a\ndistinct secondary peak in the waveform, together with its identification and\nuse for fiducializing events in the TPC, are also presented. Our measurements\ndemonstrate that SF$_{6}$ is an ideal gas for directional dark matter\ndetection. In particular, the high fluorine content is desirable for\nspin-dependent sensitivity, negative ion drift ensures low diffusion over large\ndrift distances, and the multiple species of charge carriers allow for full\ndetector fiducialization.\n", "  We investigate the recent star formation history (SFH) in the inner region of\n57 nearly face-on spiral galaxies selected from the Calar Alto Legacy Integral\nField Area (CALIFA) survey. For each galaxy we use the integral field\nspectroscopy from CALIFA to obtain two-dimensional maps and radial profiles of\nthree parameters that are sensitive indicators of the recent SFH: the 4000\\AA\\\nbreak (D$_n$(4000)), and the equivalent width of H$\\delta$ absorption\n(EW(H$\\delta_A$)) and H$\\alpha$ emission (EW(H$\\alpha$)). We have also\nperformed photometric decomposition of bulge/bar/disk components based on SDSS\noptical image. We identify a class of 17 \"turnover\" galaxies whose central\nregion present significant drop in D$_n$(4000), and most of them\ncorrespondingly show a central upturn in EW(H$\\delta_A$) and EW(H$\\alpha$).\nThis indicates that the central region of the turnover galaxies has experienced\nstar formation in the past 1-2 Gyr, which makes the bulge younger and more\nstar-forming than surrounding regions. We find almost all (15/17) the turnover\ngalaxies are barred, while only half of the barred galaxies in our sample\n(15/32) are classified as a turnover galaxy. This finding provides strong\nevidence in support of the theoretical expectation that the bar may drive gas\nfrom the disc inward to trigger star formation in galaxy center, an important\nchannel for the growth/rejuvenation of pseudobulges in disc galaxies.\n", "  A measurement of the double-differential inclusive jet cross section as a\nfunction of the jet transverse momentum pT and the absolute jet rapidity abs(y)\nis presented. Data from LHC proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns, have been\ncollected with the CMS detector. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT\nclustering algorithm with a size parameter of 0.7 in a phase space region\ncovering jet pT from 74 GeV up to 2.5 TeV and jet absolute rapidity up to\nabs(y) = 3.0. The low-pT jet range between 21 and 74 GeV is also studied up to\nabs(y) = 4.7, using a dedicated data sample corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 5.6 inverse picobarns. The measured jet cross section is\ncorrected for detector effects and compared with the predictions from\nperturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) using various sets of parton\ndistribution functions (PDF). Cross section ratios to the corresponding\nmeasurements performed at 2.76 and 7 TeV are presented. From the measured\ndouble-differential jet cross section, the value of the strong coupling\nconstant evaluated at the Z mass is alpha[S(M[Z]) = 0.1164 +0.0060 -0.0043,\nwhere the errors include the PDF, scale, nonperturbative effects and\nexperimental uncertainties, using the CT10 NLO PDFs. Improved constraints on\nPDFs based on the inclusive jet cross section measurement are presented.\n", "  Solid state electronics relies on the intentional introduction of impurity\natoms or dopants into a semiconductor crystal and/or the formation of junctions\nbetween different materials (heterojunctions) to create rectifiers, potential\nbarriers, and conducting pathways. With these building blocks, switching and\namplification of electrical currents and voltages is achieved. As\nminiaturization continues to ultra-scaled transistors with critical dimensions\non the order of ten atomic lengths, the concept of doping to form rectifying\njunctions fails and heterojunction formation becomes extremely difficult. Here\nit is shown there is no need to introduce dopant atoms nor is the formation of\na heterojunction required to achieve the fundamental electronic function of\ncurrent rectification. Ideal diode behavior or rectification is achieved for\nthe first time solely by manipulation of quantum confinement in approximately 2\nnanometer thick films consisting of a single atomic element, the semimetal\nbismuth. Crucially for nanoelectronics, this new quantum approach enables room\ntemperature operation.\n", "  We study the dynamics of two two-level atoms embedded near to the interface\nof paired meta-material slabs, one of negative permeability and the other of\nnegative permittivity. The interface behaves as a plasmonic waveguide composed\nof surface-plasmon polariton modes. It is found that significantly different\ndynamics occur for the resonant and an off-resonant couplings of the plasma\nfield to the atoms. In the case of the resonant coupling, the plasma field does\nnot appear as a dissipative reservoir to the atoms. We adopt the image method\nand show that the dynamics of the two atoms are completely equivalent to those\nof a four-atom system. Moreover, two threshold coupling strengths exist, one\ncorresponding to the strength of coupling of the plasma field to the symmetric\nand the other the antisymmetric mode of the two-atom system. The thresholds\ndistinguish between the non-Markovian (memory preserving) and Markovian\n(memoryless) regimes of the evolutions that different time scales of the\nevolution of the memory effects and entanglement can be observed. The Markovian\nregime is characterized by exponentially decaying whereas the non-Markovian\nregime by sinusoidally oscillating contributions to the evolution of the\nprobability amplitudes. The solutions predict a large and long living\nentanglement mediated by the plasma field in both Markovian and non-Markovian\nregimes of the evolution. We also show that a simultaneous Markovian and\nnon-Markovian regime of the evolution may occur in which the memory effects\nexist over a finite evolution time. In the case of an off-resonant coupling of\nthe atoms to the plasma field, the atoms interact with each other by exchanging\nvirtual photons which results in the dynamics corresponding to those of two\natoms coupled to a common reservoir. In addition, the entanglement is\nsignificantly enhanced under the off-resonant coupling.\n", "  The biological function of protein assemblies was conventionally equated with\na unique three-dimensional protein structure and protein-specific interactions.\nHowever, in the past 20 years it was found that some assemblies contain long\nflexible regions that adopt multiple structural conformations. These include\nneurofilament (NF) proteins that constitute the stress-responsive supportive\nnetwork of neurons. Herein, we show that NF networks macroscopic properties are\ntuned by enzymatic regulation of the charge found on the flexible protein\nregions. The results reveal an enzymatic (phosphorylation) regulation of\nmacroscopic properties such as orientation, stress-response and expansion in\nflexible protein assemblies. Together with a model explaining the attractive\nelectrostatic interactions induced by enzymatically added charges, we\ndemonstrate that phosphorylation-regulation is far richer and versatile than\npreviously considered.\n", "  Spectropolarimetric observations from Sunrise II/IMaX obtained in June 2013\nare used for a statistical analysis to determine the physical properties of\nmoving magnetic features (MMFs) observed near a pore. MMFs of the same and\nopposite polarity with respect to the pore are found to stream from its border\nat an average speed of 1.3 km s$^{-1}$ and 1.2 km s$^{-1}$ respectively, with\nmainly same-polarity MMFs found further away from the pore. MMFs of both\npolarities are found to harbor rather weak, inclined magnetic fields.\nOpposite-polarity MMFs are blue-shifted, while same-polarity MMFs do not show\nany preference for up- or downflows. Most of the MMFs are found to be of\nsub-arcsecond size and carry a mean flux of $\\sim$ 1.2$\\times 10^{17}$ Mx.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg inequality holds for any macrorealistic system that is being\nmeasured noninvasively. A violation of the inequality can signal that a system\ndoes not conform to our primal intuition about the physical world.\nAlternatively, a violation can simply indicate that \"clumsy\" experimental\ntechnique led to invasive measurements. Here, we consider a recent Leggett-Garg\ntest designed to try to rule out the mundane second possibility. We tailor this\nLeggett-Garg test to the IBM 5Q Quantum Experience system and find compelling\nevidence that qubit $Q_2$ of the system cannot be described by noninvasive\nmacrorealism.\n", "  We study the power corrections to Transverse Momentum Distributions (TMDs) by\nanalyzing renormalon divergences of the perturbative series. The renomalon\ndivergences arise independently in two constituents of TMDs: the rapidity\nevolution kernel and the small-b matching coefficient. The renormalon\ncontributions have a non-trivial dependence on the Bjorken variable and the\ntransverse distance. We discuss the consistency requirements for power\ncorrections for TMDs and suggest inputs for the TMD phenomenology in accordance\nwith this study. Both unpolarized quark TMD parton distribution function and\nfragmentation function are considered.\n", "  In this paper we describe how the readout planes for the MicroBooNE Time\nProjection Chamber were constructed, assembled and installed. We present the\nindividual wire preparation using semi-automatic winding machines and the\nassembly of wire carrier boards. The details of the wire installation on the\ndetector frame and the tensioning of the wires are given. A strict quality\nassurance plan ensured the integrity of the readout planes. The different tests\nperformed at all stages of construction and installation provided crucial\ninformation to achieve the successful realisation of the MicroBooNE wire\nplanes.\n", "  We report on the first ESR study of atomic hydrogen and tritium stabilized in\na solid T$_{2}$ and T$_{2}$:H$_{2}$ matrices down to 70$\\,$mK. The\nconcentrations of T atoms in pure T$_{2}$ approached $2\\times10^{20}$cm$^{-3}$\nand record-high concentrations of H atoms $\\sim1\\times10^{20}$cm$^{-3}$ were\nreached in T$_{2}$:H$_{2}$ solid mixtures where a fraction of T atoms became\nconverted into H due to the isotopic exchange reaction T+H$_2\\rightarrow$TH+H.\nThe maximum concentrations of unpaired T and H atoms was limited by their\nrecombination which becomes enforced by efficient atomic diffusion due to a\npresence of a large number of vacancies and phonons generated in the matrices\nby $\\beta$-particles. Recombination also appeared in an explosive manner both\nbeing stimulated and spontaneously in thick films where sample cooling was\ninsufficient. We suggest that the main mechanism for H and T migration is\nphysical diffusion related to tunneling or hopping to vacant sites in contrast\nto isotopic chemical reactions which govern diffusion of H and D atoms created\nin H$_{2}$ and D$_{2}$ matrices by other methods.\n", "  Landau system in noncommutative space has been considered. To take into\naccount the issue of gauge invariance in noncommutative space, we incorporate\nthe Seiberg-Witten map in our analysis. Generalised Bopp-shift transformation\nis then used to map the noncommutative system to its commutative equivalent\nsystem. In particular we have computed the partition function of the system and\nfrom this we obtained the susceptibility of the Landau system and found that\nthe result gets modified by the spatial noncommutative parameter $\\theta$. We\nalso investigate the de Hass--van Alphen effect in noncommutative space and\nobserve that the oscillation of the magnetization and the susceptibility gets\nnoncommutative corrections. Interestingly, the susceptibility in the\nnoncommutative scenario is non-zero in the range of the magnetic field greater\nthan the threshold value which is in contrast to its commutative counterpart.\nThe results obtained are valid upto all orders in the noncommutative parameter\n$\\theta$.\n", "  The low flux of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at the highest\nenergies provides a challenge to answer the long standing question about their\norigin and nature. A significant increase in the number of detected UHECR is\nexpected to be achieved by employing Earth's moon as detector, and search for\nshort radio pulses that are emitted when a particle interacts in the lunar\nrock. Observation of these short pulses with current and future radio\ntelescopes also allows to search for the even lower fluxes of neutrinos with\nenergies above $10^{22}$ eV, that are predicted in certain\nGrand-Unifying-Theories (GUTs), and e.g. models for super-heavy dark matter\n(SHDM). In this contribution we present the initial design for such a search\nwith the LOFAR radio telescope.\n", "  Channel flow of an incompressible fluid at Reynolds numbers above 2400\npossesses a number of different spatially localized solutions that approach\nlaminar flow far upstream and downstream. We use one such relative\ntime-periodic solution, which corresponds to a spatially localized version of a\nTollmien-Schlichting wave, to illustrate how the upstream and downstream\nasymptotics can be computed analytically. In particular, we show that for these\nspanwise uniform states the asymptotics predict the exponential localization\nthat has been observed for numerically computed solutions of several canonical\nshear flows but never properly understood theoretically.\n", "  We consider various models realizing baryogenesis during the electroweak\nphase transition (EWBG). Our focus is their possible detection in future\ncollider experiments and possible observation of gravitational waves emitted\nduring the phase transition. We also discuss the possibility of a non-standard\ncosmological history which can facilitate EWBG. We show how acceptable\nparameter space can be extended due to such a modification and conclude that\nnext generation precision experiments such as the ILC will be able to confirm\nor falsify many models realizing EWBG. We also show that, in general, collider\nsearches are a more powerful probe than gravitational wave searches. However,\nobservation of a deviation from the SM without any hints of gravitational waves\ncan point to models with modified cosmological history that generically enable\nEWBG with weaker phase transition and thus, smaller GW signals.\n", "  The ARIANNA experiment is currently taking data in its pilot-phase on the\nRoss ice-shelf. Fully autonomous stations measure radio signals in the\nfrequency range from 100 MHz to 1 GHz. The seven station HRA was completed in\nDecember 2014, and augmented by two special purpose stations with unique\nconfigurations. In its full extent ARIANNA is targeted at detecting\ninteractions of cosmogenic neutrinos (> 1016eV) in the ice-shelf.\nDownward-pointing antennas installed at the surface will record the radio\nemission created by neutrino-induced showers in the ice and exploit the fact\nthat the ice- water surface acts as a mirror for radio emission. ARIANNA\nstations are independent, low-powered, easy to install and equipped with\nreal-time communication via satellite modems. We report on the current status\nof the HRA, as well as air shower detections that have been made over the past\nyear. Furthermore, we will discuss the search for neutrino emission, future\nplans and the energy-dependent sensitivity of the experiment.\n", "  We theoretically and numerically investigate spin waves that occur in systems\nof classical magnetic dipoles that are arranged at the vertices of a regular\npolygon and interact solely via their magnetic fields. There are certain\nlimiting cases that can be analyzed in detail. One case is that of spin waves\nas infinitesimal excitations from the system's ground state, where the\ndispersion relation can be determined analytically. The frequencies of these\ninfinitesimal spin waves are compared with the peaks of the Fourier transform\nof the thermal expectation value of the autocorrelation function calculated by\nMonte Carlo simulations. In the special case of vanishing wave number an exact\nsolution of the equations of motion is possible describing synchronized\noscillations with finite amplitudes. Finally, the limiting case of a dipole\nchain with $N\\longrightarrow \\infty$ is investigated and completely solved.\n", "  Conformal symmetry relates the metric on $AdS_2 \\times S^{1}$ to that of\n$S^3$. This implies that under a suitable choice of boundary conditions for\nfields on $AdS_2$ the partition function of conformal field theories on these\nspaces must agree which makes $AdS_2 \\times S^{1}$ a good testing ground to\nstudy localization on non-compact spaces. We study supersymmetry on\n$AdS_2\\times S^1$ and determine the localizing Lagrangian for ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetric Chern-Simons theory on $AdS_2\\times S^1$. We evaluate the\npartition function of ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory on $AdS_2\n\\times S^1$ using localization, where the radius of $S^1$ is $q$ times that of\n$AdS_2$. With boundary conditions on $AdS_2\\times S^1$ which ensure that all\nthe physical fields are normalizable and lie in the space of square integrable\nwave functions in $AdS_2$, the result for the partition function precisely\nagrees with that of the theory on the $q$-fold covering of $S^3$.\n", "  It has previously been found that a magnetic impurity in a conventional\n$s$-wave superconductor can give rise to a local $\\pi$-phase shift of the\nsuperconducting order parameter. By studying a finite wire of ferromagnetic\nimpurities, we are able to trace the origin of the $\\pi$-phase shift to a\nresonance condition for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes quasiparticle states. When\nnon-resonating states localized at the impurity sites are pulled into the\ncondensate for increasing magnetic strength, the superconducting order\nparameter is reduced in discrete steps, eventually resulting in a $\\pi$-phase\nshift. We also show that for a finite spin-orbit coupling, the $\\pi$-phase\nshift is preserved and occurs in a large portion of the topologically\nnon-trivial phase.\n", "  Phonon-assisted electronic tunnelings through a vibrating quantum dot\nembedded between normal and superconducting leads are studied in the Kondo\nregime. In such a hybrid device, with the bias applied to the normal lead, we\nfind a series of Kondo sidebands separated by half a phonon energy in the\ndifferential conductance, which are distinct from the phonon-assisted sidebands\npreviously observed in the conventional Andreev tunnelings and in systems with\nonly normal leads. These Kondo sidebands originate from the Kondo-Andreev\ncooperative cotunneling mediated by phonons, which exhibit a novel Kondo\ntransport behavior due to the interplay of the Kondo effect, the Andreev\ntunnelings, and the mechanical vibrations. Our result could be observed in a\nrecent experiment setup [J. Gramich \\emph{et al.}, PRL \\textbf{115}, 216801\n(2015)], provided that their carbon nanotube device reaches the Kondo regime at\nlow temperatures.\n", "  Incompressible 3D Euler equations develop high vorticity in very thin\npancake-like regions from generic large-scale initial conditions. In this work\nwe propose an exact solution of the Euler equations for the asymptotic pancake\nevolution. This solution combines a shear flow aligned with an asymmetric\nstraining flow, and is characterized by a single asymmetry parameter and an\narbitrary transversal vorticity profile. The analysis is based on detailed\ncomparison with numerical simulations performed using a pseudo-spectral method\nin anisotropic grids of up to 972 x 2048 x 4096.\n", "  We study supersymmetric gauge theories with an R-symmetry, defined on\nnon-compact, hyperbolic, Riemannian three-manifolds, focusing on the case of a\nsupersymmetry-preserving quotient of Euclidean AdS$_3$. We compute the exact\npartition function in these theories, using the method of localization, thus\nreducing the problem to the computation of one-loop determinants around a\nsupersymmetric locus. We evaluate the one-loop determinants employing three\ndifferent techniques: an index theorem, the method of pairing of eigenvalues,\nand the heat kernel method. Along the way, we discuss aspects of supersymmetry\nin manifolds with a conformal boundary, including supersymmetric actions and\nboundary conditions.\n", "  We demonstrate condensation of microcavity polaritons with a very sharp\nthreshold occuring at two orders of magnitude lower pump intensity than\nprevious demonstrations of condensation. The long cavity-lifetime and trapping\nand pumping geometries are crucial to the realization of this low threshold.\nPolariton condensation, or \"polariton lasing\" has long been proposed as a\npromising source of coherent light at lower threshold than traditional lasing,\nand these results suggest methods to bring this threshold even lower.\n", "  We develop an efficient quantum implementation of an important signal\nprocessing algorithm for line spectral estimation: the matrix pencil method,\nwhich determines the frequencies and damping factors of signals consisting of\nfinite sums of exponentially damped sinusoids. Our algorithm provides a quantum\nspeedup in a natural regime where the sampling rate is much higher than the\nnumber of sinusoid components. Along the way, we develop techniques that are\nexpected to be useful for other quantum algorithms as well - consecutive phase\nestimations to efficiently make products of asymmetric low rank matrices\nclassically accessible and an alternative method to efficiently exponentiate\nnon-Hermitian matrices. Our algorithm features an efficient quantum-classical\ndivision of labor: The time-critical steps are implemented in quantum\nsuperposition, while an interjacent step, requiring only exponentially few\nparameters, can operate classically. We show that frequencies and damping\nfactors can be obtained in time logarithmic in the number of sampling points,\nexponentially faster than known classical algorithms.\n", "  In this manuscript we review the possibility of inducing large coherence in a\nmacroscopic dense target by using adiabatic techniques. For this purpose we\ninvestigate the degradation of the laser pulse through propagation, which was\nalso related to the size of the prepared medium. Our results show that,\nalthough adiabatic techniques offer the best alternative in terms of stability\nagainst experimental parameters, for very dense media it is necessary to\nengineer laser-matter interaction in order to minimize laser field degradation.\nThis work has been triggered by the proposal of a new technique, namely\nRadiative Emission of Neutrino Pairs (RENP), capable of investigating neutrino\nphysics through quantum optics concepts which require the preparation of a\nmacrocoherent state.\n", "  It is well known that the rate of cosmic ray muons depends on the atmospheric\ntemperature, and that for events with a single muon the peak of the rate is in\nsummer, in underground laboratories in the northern hemisphere. In 2015 the\nMINOS experiment, in USA, found that, for small distances between the\nmultiple-muons, the rate of multiple-muons peaks in the winter and that the\namplitude of the modulation is smaller than in the case of a single muon. I\nhave done a re-analysis of data of the past MACRO experiment. The result is\nthat under Gran Sasso the rate of multiple-muons at small distances peaks in\nthe summer. This difference with MINOS could be explained by differences in the\natmospheric temperature due to latitude. This results could be of interest for\ndark matter experiments looking to dark matter seasonal modulation due to the\nEarth's motion.\n", "  We investigate the efficiency of gelation and network formation in telechelic\nstar polymer melt, where the tips of polymer arms are dipoles while rest of the\nmonomers are uncharged. Our work is motivated by the experimental observations\n[A.Kulkarni et.al, Macromolecules, {\\bf 48}, 6580 (2015)], in which rheological\nstudies of telechelic star polymers of poly-(L-actide), a bio-degradable\npolymer, showed a drastic increase in elastic properties (up to $2000$ times)\ncompared to corresponding star polymers without the telechelic arm ends. In\ncontrast to previous studies, we avoid using effective attractive Lennard Jones\npotentials or dipolar potentials to model telechelic interactions. Instead we\nuse explicit Coulomb positive and negative charges at the tip of polymer-arms\nof our bead-spring model of star polymers. By our simulations we show that the\ndipoles at the tip of star arms aggregate together to form clusters of dipoles.\nEach cluster has contribution from several stars, and in turn each star\ncontributes to several clusters. Thus the entire polymer melt forms a connected\nnetwork. Network forming tendencies decrease with decrease of the value of the\neffective charge constituting the dipole: this can be experimentally realized\nby choosing a different ionomer for the star tip. We systematically varied the\nvalue of dipole charges, the fraction of star-arms with dipoles at the tip and\nthe length of the arms. The choice of explicit charges in our calculations\nenables us to make better quantitative predictions about the onset of gelation,\nmoreover we get qualitatively distinct results about structural organization of\ndipoles within a dipole-cluster.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in many areas of\nphysics, ranging from cosmology and particle physics to condensed matter. A\nprime example is the breaking of spatial translation symmetry, which underlies\nthe formation of crystals and the phase transition from liquid to solid.\nAnalogous to crystals in space, the breaking of translation symmetry in time\nand the emergence of a \"time crystal\" was recently proposed, but later shown to\nbe forbidden in thermal equilibrium. However, non-equilibrium Floquet systems\nsubject to a periodic drive can exhibit persistent time-correlations at an\nemergent sub-harmonic frequency. This new phase of matter has been dubbed a\n\"discrete time crystal\" (DTC). Here, we present the first experimental\nobservation of a discrete time crystal, in an interacting spin chain of trapped\natomic ions. We apply a periodic Hamiltonian to the system under many-body\nlocalization (MBL) conditions, and observe a sub-harmonic temporal response\nthat is robust to external perturbations. Such a time crystal opens the door\nfor studying systems with long-range spatial-temporal correlations and novel\nphases of matter that emerge under intrinsically non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  We explore the construction of supersymmetric solutions of theories of\nN=2,d=4 supergravity with a SU(2) gauging and SU(2) Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. In\nthese theories an SU(2) isometry subgroup of the Special Kahler manifold is\ngauged together with a SU(2) R-symmetry subgroup. We construct several\nsolutions of the CP3 quadratic model directly in four dimensions and of the\nST[2,6] model by dimensional reduction of the solutions found by Cariglia and\nMac Conamhna in N=(1,0),d=6 supergravity with the same kind of gauging. In the\nCP3 model, we construct an AdS2xS2 solution which is only 1/8 BPS and an RxH3\nsolution that also preserves 1 of the 8 possible supersymmetries. We show how\nto use dimensional reduction as in the ungauged case to obtain RnxSm and also\nAdSnxSm-type solutions (with different radii) in - and 4 dimensions from the\n6-dimensional AdS3xS3 solution.\n", "  This short note presents works done in collaboration with S. Pakuliak (JINR,\nDubna) and N. Slavnov (Steklov Math. Inst., Moscow). It is a summary of the\narticles arXiv:1412.6037, arXiv:1501.07566, arXiv:1502.01966 and\narXiv:1503.00546. Here are mentioned only references used for our calculations.\nA detailed list of references can be found in our articles mentionned here.\n", "  We propose a new experiment to measure the running of the fine-structure\nconstant in the space-like region by scattering high-energy muons on atomic\nelectrons of a low-Z target through the process $\\mu e \\to \\mu e$. The\ndifferential cross section of this process, measured as a function of the\nsquared momentum transfer $t=q^2<0$, provides direct sensitivity to the\nleading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomaly $a^{\\rm{HLO}}_{\\mu}$.\nBy using a muon beam of 150 GeV, with an average rate of $\\sim1.3\\times 10^7$\nmuon/s, currently available at the CERN North Area, a statistical uncertainty\nof $\\sim 0.3\\%$ can be achieved on $a^{\\rm{HLO}}_{\\mu}$ after two years of data\ntaking. This direct measurement of $a^{\\rm{HLO}}_{\\mu}$ will provide an\nindependent determination, competitive with the time-like dispersive approach,\nand consolidate the theoretical prediction for the muon $g$-2 in the Standard\nModel. It will allow therefore a firmer interpretation of the measurements of\nthe future muon $g$-2 experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC.\n", "  We present results on the clustering properties of galaxies as a function of\nboth stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) using data from the\nPRIMUS and DEEP2 galaxy redshift surveys spanning 0.2 < z < 1.2. We use\nspectroscopic redshifts of over 100,000 galaxies covering an area of 7.2 deg^2\nover five separate fields on the sky, from which we calculate cosmic variance\nerrors. We find that the galaxy clustering amplitude is as strong of a function\nof sSFR as of stellar mass, and that at a given sSFR, it does not significantly\ndepend on stellar mass within the range probed here. We further find that\nwithin the star-forming population and at a given stellar mass, galaxies above\nthe main sequence of star formation with higher sSFR are less clustered than\ngalaxies below the main sequence with lower sSFR. We also find that within the\nquiescent population, galaxies with higher sSFR are less clustered than\ngalaxies with lower sSFR, at a given stellar mass. We show that the galaxy\nclustering amplitude smoothly increases with both increasing stellar mass and\ndecreasing sSFR, implying that galaxies likely evolve across the main sequence,\nnot only along it, before galaxies eventually become quiescent. These results\nimply that the stellar mass to halo mass relation, which connects galaxies to\ndark matter halos, likely depends on sSFR.\n", "  There is an increasing interest in nonlinear supersymmetries in cosmological\nmodel building. Independently, elegant expressions for the all-tree amplitudes\nin models with nonlinear symmetries, like D3 brane\nDirac-Born-Infeld-Volkov-Akulov theory, were recently discovered. Using the\ngeneralized background field method we show how, in general, nonlinear\nsymmetries of the action, bosonic and fermionic, constrain amplitudes beyond\nsoft limits. The same identities control, for example, bosonic E_{7(7)} scalar\nsector symmetries as well as the fermionic goldstino symmetries.\n  We present a universal derivation of the vanishing amplitudes in the single\n(bosonic or fermionic) soft limit. We explain why, universally, the double-soft\nlimit probes the coset space algebra. We also provide identities describing the\nmultiple-soft limit. We discuss loop corrections to N\\geq 5 supergravity, to\nthe D3 brane, and the UV completion of constrained multiplets in string theory.\n", "  We apply the background field technique, recently developed for a general\nclass of nonlinear symmetries, at tree level, to the Volkov-Akulov theory with\nspontaneously broken N=1 supersymmetry. We find that the background field\nexpansion in terms of the free fields to the lowest order reproduces the\nnonlinear supersymmetry transformation rules. The double soft limit of the\nbackground field is, in agreement with the new general identities, defined by\nthe algebra of the nonlinear symmetries.\n", "  The self-referenced spectral interferometry (SRSI) technique, which is\nusually used for microjoule-level femtosecond pulses characterization, is\nimproved to characterize weak femtosecond pulses with nanojoule based on the\ntransient-grating effect. Both femtosecond pulses from an amplifier with 3 nJ\nper pulse at 1 kHz repetition rates and femtosecond pulses from an oscillator\nwith less than 0.5 nJ per pulse at 84 MHz repetition rates are successfully\ncharacterized. Furthermore, through a special design, the optical setup of the\ndevice is even smaller than a palm which will makes it simple and convenient\nduring the application. These improvements extend the application of SRSI\ntechnique to the characterization of femtosecond pulses in a broad range. Not\nonly pulses from an amplifier but also pulses from an oscillator or weak pulses\nused in ultrafast spectroscopy can be monitored with this SRSI method right\nnow.\n", "  We investigate the influence of slab thickness on the electronic structure of\nthe Si(100)-p(2x2) surface in density functional theory (DFT) calculations,\nconsidering both density of states and band structure. Our calculations, with\nslab thicknesses of up to 78 atomic layers, reveal that the slab thickness\nprofoundly affects the surface band structure, particularly the dangling bond\nstates of the silicon dimers near the Fermi level. We find that, to precisely\nreproduce the surface bands, the slab thickness needs to be large enough to\ncompletely converge the bulk bands in the slab. In case of the Si(100) surface,\nthe dispersion features of the surface bands, such as the band shape and width,\nconverge when the slab thickness is larger than 30 layers. Complete convergence\nof both the surface and bulk bands in the slab is only achieved when the slab\nthickness is greater than 60 layers.\n", "  I report on recent results obtained within the Hamiltonian approach to QCD in\nCoulomb gauge. By relating the Gribov confinement scenario to the center vortex\npicture of confinement it is shown that the Coulomb string tension is tied to\nthe spatial string tension. For the quark sector a vacuum wave functional is\nused which results in variational equations which are free of ultraviolet\ndivergences. The variational approach is extended to finite temperatures by\ncompactifying a spatial dimension. For the chiral and deconfinement phase\ntransition pseudo-critical temperatures of 170 MeV and 198 MeV, respectively,\nare obtained.\n", "  We address the question of how to represent an interacting action for the\ntower of conformal higher spin fields in a form covariant with respect to a\nbackground metric. We use a background metric to define a star product which\nplays a central role in the definition of the corresponding gauge\ntransformations. By an analogy with the kinetic term in the 4-derivative Weyl\ngravity action expanded near an on-shell background one expects that the\nkinetic term in such an action should be gauge-invariant in a Bach-flat metric.\nWe demonstrate this fact to first order in expansion in powers of the curvature\nof the background metric. This generalizes the result of arXiv:1404.7452 for\nspin 3 case to all conformal higher spins. We also comment on a possibility of\nextending this claim to terms quadratic in the curvature and discuss the\nappearance of background-dependent mixing terms in the quadratic part of the\nconformal higher spin action.\n", "  We present a description of cosmic neutrinos as a dispersive fluid. In this\napproach, the neutrino phase space is reduced to density and velocity fields\nalongside a scale-dependent sound speed. This sound speed depends on redshift,\nthe initial neutrino phase space density and the cold dark matter gravitational\npotential. The latter is a new coupling between neutrinos and large scale\nstructure not described by previous fluid approaches. We compute the sound\nspeed in linear theory and find that it asymptotes to constants at small and\nlarge scales regardless of the gravitational potential. By comparing with\nneutrino N-body simulations, we measure the small scale sound speed and find it\nto be lower than linear theory predictions. This allows for an explanation of\nthe discrepency between N-body and linear response predictions for the neutrino\npower spectrum: neutrinos are still driven predominantly by the cold dark\nmatter, but the sound speed on small scales is not stable to perturbations and\ndecreases. Finally, we present a calibrated model for the neutrino power\nspectrum that requires no additional integrations outside of standard Boltzmann\ncodes.\n", "  The topology of a single-particle band structure plays a fundamental role in\nunderstanding a multitude of physical phenomena. Motivated by the connection\nbetween quantum walks and such topological band structures, we demonstrate that\na simple time-dependent, Bloch-oscillating quantum walk enables the direct\nmeasurement of topological invariants. We consider two classes of\none-dimensional quantum walks and connect the global phase imprinted on the\nwalker with its refocusing behavior. By disentangling the dynamical and\ngeometric contributions to this phase we describe a general strategy to measure\nthe topological invariant in these quantum walks. As an example, we propose an\nexperimental protocol in a circuit QED architecture where a superconducting\ntransmon qubit plays the role of the coin, while the quantum walk takes place\nin the phase space of a cavity.\n", "  A procedure is presented to map from the spatial correlation parameters of a\nturbulent density field (the radial and binormal correlation lengths and\nwavenumbers, and the fluctuation amplitude) to correlation parameters that\nwould be measured by a Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic. The inverse\nmapping is also derived, which results in resolution criteria for recovering\ncorrect correlation parameters, depending on the spatial response of the\ninstrument quantified in terms of Point-Spread Functions (PSFs). Thus, a\nprocedure is presented that allows for a systematic comparison between\ntheoretical predictions and experimental observations. This procedure is\nillustrated using the MAST BES system and the validity of the underlying\nassumptions is tested on fluctuating density fields generated by direct\nnumerical simulations using the gyrokinetic code GS2. The measurement of the\ncorrelation time, by means of the cross-correlation time-delay (CCTD) method,\nis also investigated and is shown to be sensitive to the fluctuating radial\ncomponent of velocity, as well as to small variations in the spatial properties\nof the PSFs.\n", "  We provide the first example of a communication model and a distributed task,\nfor which there exists a realistic quantum protocol which is asymptotically\nmore efficient than any classical protocol, both in the communication and the\ninformation resources. For this, we extend a recently proposed coherent state\nmapping for quantum communication protocols, introduce the notion of\nmultiplexed coherent state fingerprints and show how to use them to design an\nefficient quantum protocol for estimating the Euclidean distance of two real\nvectors within a constant factor.\n", "  Recent experiments on lead (\\textrm{$Pb_{82}^{208}$}) nuclei have observed\nthe celebrated phenomenon of neutron skin-thickness of low energy nuclear\nphysics. The skin-thickness provides a measure of extension of spatial\ndistribution of neutrons inside the atomic nucleus than protons. We have\nstudied the effect of neutron skin-thickness on inclusive prompt photon\nproduction in Pb~+~Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider energies. We have\ncalculated the \\textquoteleft central-to-peripheral ratio\\textquoteright\n($R_\\textrm{cp}$) of prompt photon production with and without accounting for\nneutron skin effect. The neutron skin causes a characteristic enhancement in\nthe ratio, in particular at forward rapidity, which is distinguishable in our\ncalculation. However a very precise direct photon measurement up to large\ntransverse momenta would be necessary to constrain the feature in experiment.\n", "  Recently interesting observations on electron vortex beams, which have\nangular momentum about the center of the vortex beams, have been made. We have\nshown that the basic features of the electron vortex beams in a uniform\nmagnetic field are understandable by using the classical motions of electrons.\nWe have constructed a classical vortex-like motion by the collective motion of\nindividual electrons in their cyclotron motions with a constant canonical\nangular momentum in the symmetric gauge, which models electron vortex beams, in\na uniform magnetic field. With this model the various properties of circulating\ncurrents and the relation between energy and kinetic angular momentum in the\nelectron vortex beams are well explained. We have also shown that the mismatch\nbetween the centers of the electron vortex beam and the classical cyclotron\norbits naturally induces the parallel axis theorem and also the time-varying\nkinetic angular momentum of the electron vortex beam for certain distributions\nof classical electrons.\n", "  We address the question as to whether data for J/\\psi mesons produced\nexclusively in the forward direction at the LHC can be used in global parton\nanalyses (based on collinear factorization) to pin down the low x gluon PDF. We\nshow that it may be possible to overcome the problems that (i) the process is\ndescribed by a skewed or Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD), (ii) it is very\nsensitive to the choice of factorization scale and (iii) there is bad LO,\nNLO,... perturbative stability to the predictions. However, we start by briefly\nexplaining how the alternative k_T factorization approach has been used to\ndescribe the process.\n", "  Alvarez-type cavities are commonly used to reliably accelerate high quality\nhadron beams. Optimization of their longitudinal field homogeneity is usually\naccomplished by post-couplers, i.e. additional rods being integrated into the\ncavity. This paper instead proposes to use the stems that keep the drift tubes\nfor that purpose. As their individual azimuthal orientations do not change the\ncavity's undisturbed operational mode, they comprise a set of free parameters\nthat can be used to modify higher mode field patterns. The latter have\nsignificant impact on the robustness of the operational mode w.r.t. eventual\nperturbations. Several optimized stem configurations are presented and\nbenchmarked against each other. The path to obtain these configurations is\npaved analytically and worked out in detail through simulations. It is shown\nthat the method provides for flat field distributions and very low field tilt\nsensitivities without insertion of post-couplers.\n", "  Hydrostatic pressure applied using diamond anvil cells (DAC) has been widely\nexplored to modulate physical properties of materials by tuning their lattice\ndegree of freedom. Independently, electrical field is able to tune the\nelectronic degree of freedom of functional materials via, for example, the\nfield-effect transistor (FET) configuration. Combining these two orthogonal\napproaches would allow discovery of new physical properties and phases going\nbeyond the known phase space. Such experiments are, however, technically\nchallenging and have not been demonstrated. Herein, we report a feasible\nstrategy to prepare and measure FETs in a DAC by lithographically patterning\nthe nanodevices onto the diamond culet. Multiple-terminal FETs were fabricated\nin the DAC using few-layer MoS2 and BN as the channel semiconductor and\ndielectric layer, respectively. It is found that the mobility, conductance,\ncarrier concentration, and contact conductance of MoS2 can all be significantly\nenhanced with pressure. We expect that the approach could enable unprecedented\nways to explore new phases and properties of materials under coupled\nmechano-electrostatic modulation.\n", "  We have calculated the zero-temperature binding energy of a single impurity\natom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate of ultracold atoms that are trapped\nin an axially symmetric harmonic potential, where the impurity interacts with\nbosonic atoms in the condensate via a low-energy s-wave scattering. In this\ncase, bosons are excited around the impurity to form a quasiparticle, namely, a\nBEC polaron. We have developed a variational method, {\\it a la} Lee-Low-Pines\n(LLP) theory for electron-phonon systems, for description of the polaron with a\nconserved angular momentum around the symmetric axis. It is found in numerical\nresults that the binding energy between the impurity and the excited bosons\nbreak the degeneracy with respect to the total angular momentum of the polaron.\nThe angular momentum is partially shared by the excited bosons, which is due to\na mechanism similar to the drag effect on the polaron momentum by a phonon\ncloud in the LLP theory.\n", "  Density functional calculations are performed to study the magnetic order of\nthe severely distorted square planar cupric oxide (CuO) and local spin disorder\nin it in the presence of the transition metal impurities M (= Cr, Mn, Fe, Co\nand Ni). The distortion in the crystal structure, arisen to reduce the band\nenergy by minimizing the covalent interaction, creates two crisscrossing zigzag\nspin-1/2 chains. From the spin dimer analysis we find that while the spin chain\nalong [10$\\bar 1$] has strong Heisenberg type antiferromagnetic coupling (J ~\n127 meV), along [101] it exhibits weak, but robust, ferromagnetic coupling (J ~\n9 meV) mediated by reminiscent p-d covalent interactions. The impurity effect\non the magnetic ordering is independent of M and purely orbital driven. If the\ngiven spin-state of M is such that the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is spin-polarized,\nthen the original long-range ordering is maintained. However, if d$_{x^2-y^2}$\norbital is unoccupied, the absence of corresponding covalent interaction breaks\nthe weak ferromagnetic coupling and a spin-flip takes place at the impurity\nsite leading to breakdown of the long range magnetic ordering.\n", "  We construct the adiabatic regularization method for a $U(1)$ gauge field in\na conformally flat spacetime by quantizing in the canonical formalism the gauge\nfixed $U(1)$ theory with mass terms for the gauge fields and the ghost fields.\nWe show that the adiabatic expansion for the mode functions and the adiabatic\nvacuum can be defined in a similar way using WKB-type solutions as the scalar\nfields. As an application of the adiabatic method, we compute the trace of the\nenergy momentum tensor and reproduces the known result for the conformal\nanomaly obtained by the other regularization methods. The availability of the\nadiabatic expansion scheme for gauge field allows one to study the\nrenormalization of the de-Sitter space maximal superconformal Yang-Mills theory\nusing the adiabatic regularization method.\n", "  The recent measurement of the differential $ \\gamma+c $-jet cross section,\nperformed at the Tevatron collider in Run II by the D0 collaboration, is\nstudied in a next-to-leading order (NLO) global QCD analysis to assess its\nimpact on the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs). We show that these\ndata lead to a significant change on the gluon and charm quark distributions.\nWe demonstrate also that there is an inconsistency between the new high\nprecision HERA I+II combined data and Tevatron measurement. Moreover, in this\nstudy we investigate the impact of older EMC measurements of charm structure\nfunction $F_{c}^{2}$ on the PDFs and compare the results with those gaining\nfrom the analysis of Tevatron data. We show that both of them have a same\nimpact on PDFs, and thus can be recognized as same evidences for inefficiency\nof perturbative QCD in dealing with the charm production in some kinematic\nregions.\n", "  The large-scale features of the global ocean circulation and the sensitivity\nof these features with respect to forcing changes are critically dependent upon\nthe influence of the mesoscale eddy field. One such feature, observed in\nnumerical simulations whereby the mesoscale eddy field is at least partially\nresolved, is the phenomenon of eddy saturation, where the time-mean circumpolar\ntransport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current displays relative insensitivity\nto wind forcing changes. Coarse-resolution models employing the\nGent--McWilliams parameterisation with a constant Gent--McWilliams coefficient\nseem unable to reproduce this phenomenon. In this article, an idealised model\nfor a wind-forced, zonally symmetric flow in a channel is used to investigate\nthe sensitivity of the circumpolar transport to changes in wind forcing under\ndifferent eddy closures. It is shown that, when coupled to a simple\nparameterised eddy energy budget, the Gent--McWilliams coefficient of the form\ndescribed in Marshall et al. (2012) [A framework for parameterizing eddy\npotential vorticity fluxes, J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 42, 539--557], which\nincludes a linear eddy energy dependence, produces eddy saturation as an\nemergent property.\n", "  We show that gauge coupling unification is realized with a greater accuracy\nin the presence of a massless hidden photon which has a large kinetic mixing\nwith hypercharge. We solve the renormalization group equations at two-loop\nlevel and find that the GUT unification scale is around $10^{16.5}$ GeV which\nsufficiently suppresses the proton decay rate, and that the unification is\nessentially determined by the kinetic mixing only, and it is rather insensitive\nto the hidden gauge coupling or the presence of vector-like matter fields\ncharged under U(1)$_H$ and/or SU(5). Matter fields charged under the unbroken\nhidden U(1)$_H$ are stable and they contribute to dark matter. Interestingly,\nthey become minicharged dark matter which carries a small but non-zero electric\ncharge, if the hidden gauge coupling is tiny. The minicharged dark matter is a\nnatural outcome of the gauge coupling unification with a hidden photon.\n", "  Totally symmetric continuous spin field propagating in (A)dS is studied.\nLagrangian gauge invariant formulation for such field is developed. Lagrangian\nof continuous spin field is constructed in terms of double traceless tensor\nfields, while gauge transformations are constructed in terms of traceless gauge\ntransformation parameters. de Donder like gauge condition that leads to simple\ngauge fixed Lagrangian is found. Gauge-fixed Lagrangian invariant under global\nBRST transformations is presented. The BRST Lagrangian is used for computation\nof a partition function. It is demonstrated that the partition function of the\ncontinuous spin field is equal to one. Various decoupling limits of the\ncontinuous spin field are also studied.\n", "  Localized bulk excitations in AdS/CFT are produced by operators which modify\nthe pattern of entanglement in the boundary state. We show that simple\nmodels--consisting of entanglement swapping operators acting on a qubit system\nor a free field theory--capture qualitative features of gravitational\nbackreaction and reproduce predictions of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. These\nentanglement swapping operators naturally admit multiple representations\nassociated with different degrees of freedom, thereby reproducing the code\nsubspace structure emphasized by Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow. We also show that\nthe boundary Reeh-Schlieder theorem implies that equivalence of certain\noperators on a code subspace necessarily breaks down when non-perturbative\neffects are taken into account (as is expected based on bulk arguments).\n", "  The higher-order gas-kinetic scheme for solving the Navier-Stokes equations\nhas been studied in recent years. In addition to the use of higher-order\nreconstruction techniques, many terms are used in the Taylor expansion of the\ngas distribution functions. Therefore, a large number of coefficients need to\nbe determined in the calculation of the time evolution of the gas distribution\nfunction at cell interfaces. As a consequence, the higher-order flux function\ntakes much more computational time than that of a second-order gas-kinetic\nscheme. This paper aims to simplify the evolution model by two steps. Firstly,\nthe coefficients related to the higher-order spatial and temporal derivatives\nof a distribution function are redefined to reduce the computational cost.\nSecondly, based on the physical analysis, some terms can be removed without\nloss of accuracy. Through the simplifications, the computational efficiency of\nthe higher-order scheme is increased significantly. In addition, a\nself-adaptive numerical viscosity is designed to minimize the necessary\nnumerical dissipation. Several numerical examples are tested to demonstrate the\naccuracy and robustness of the current scheme.\n", "  The analog of two seminal quantum optics experiments are considered in a\ncondensed matter setting with single electron sources injecting electronic wave\npackets on edge states coupled through a quantum point contact. When only one\nelectron is injected, the measurement of noise correlations at the output of\nthe quantum point contact corresponds to the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss setup.\nWhen two electrons are injected on opposite edges, the equivalent of the\nHong-Ou-Mandel collision is achieved, exhibiting a dip as in the coincidence\nmeasurements of quantum optics. The Landauer-Buttiker scattering theory is used\nto first review these phenomena in the integer quantum Hall effect, next, to\nfocus on two more exotic systems: edge states of two dimensional topological\ninsulators, where new physics emerges from time reversal symmetry and three\nelectron collisions can be achieved; and edges states of a hybrid\nHall/superconducting device, which allow to perform electron quantum optics\nexperiments with Bogoliubov quasiparticles.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the algebraic geometric nature of a solution of\nthe Yang-Baxter equation based on the quantum deformation of the centrally\nextended $sl(2|2)$ superalgebra proposed by Beisert and Koroteev \\cite{BEKO}.\nWe derive an alternative representation for the $\\mathrm{R}$-matrix in which\nthe matrix elements are given in terms of rational functions depending on\nweights sited on a degree six surface. For generic gauge the weights geometry\nare governed by a genus one ruled surface while for a symmetric gauge choice\nthe weights lie instead on a genus five curve. We have written down the\npolynomial identities satisfied by the $\\mathrm{R}$-matrix entries needed to\nuncover the corresponding geometric properties. For arbitrary gauge the\n$\\mathrm{R}$-matrix geometry is argued to be birational to the direct product\n$\\mathbb{CP}^1 \\times \\mathbb{CP}^1 \\times \\mathrm{A}$ where $\\mathrm{A}$ is an\nAbelian surface. For the symmetric gauge we present evidences that the\ngeometric content is that of a surface of general type lying on the so-called\nSeveri line with irregularity two and geometric genus nine. We discuss\npotential geometric degenerations when the two free couplings are restricted to\ncertain one-dimensional subspaces.\n", "  We present a robust sideband laser locking technique that is ideally suited\nfor applications requiring low probe power and heterodyne readout. By feeding\nback to a high-bandwidth voltage controlled oscillator, we lock a first-order\nphase-modulation sideband to a table-top high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity,\nachieving a feedback bandwidth of 3.5 MHz with a single integrator, limited\nfundamentally by the signal delay. The directly measured transfer function of\nthe closed feedback loop agrees with a model assuming ideal system components,\nand from this we suggest a modified design that should realistically achieve a\nbandwidth exceeding 6 MHz with a near-causally limited feedback gain of\n$4\\times 10^7$ at 1 kHz. The off-resonance optical carrier is used for\nalignment-free heterodyne readout, alleviating the need for a second laser or\nadditional optical modulators.\n", "  In this paper a detailed Hamiltonian analysis of three-dimensional gravity\nwithout dynamics proposed by V. Hussain is performed. We report the complete\nstructure of the constraints and the Dirac brackets are explicitly computed. In\naddition, the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic approach is developed; we report the\ncomplete set of Faddeev-Jackiw constraints and the generalized brackets, then\nwe show that the Dirac and the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets coincide to\neach other. Finally, the similarities and advantages between Faddeev-Jackiw and\nDirac's formalism are briefly discussed.\n", "  We study anomalous transport phenomena induced by phase-space Berry\ncurvature. For that purpose we construct a kinetic theory in $2d$ phase space\nwhen all abelian Berry curvatures are nonzero. We derive anomalous currents by\ncalculating the complete form of the Poisson brackets of phase space\ncoordinates. Then we construct the low-energy effective theory to reproduce the\nanomalous currents obtained from the kinetic theory. Such an effective theory\nis given by the Chern-Simons theory in $1+2d$ dimensions. Some implications of\nthe Chern-Simons theory are also discussed.\n", "  In the new precision era for cosmic ray astrophysics, theoretical predictions\ncannot content themselves with average trends, but need to correctly take into\naccount intrinsic uncertainties. The space-time discreteness of the cosmic ray\nsources, together with a substantial ignorance of their precise epochs and\nlocations (with the possible exception of the most recent and close ones) play\nan important role in this sense. We elaborate a statistical theory to deal with\nthis problem, relating the composite probability P({\\Psi}) to obtain a flux\n{\\Psi} at the Earth and the single-source probability p({\\psi}) to contribute\nwith a flux {\\psi}. The main difficulty arises from the fact that p({\\psi}) is\na fat tail distribution, characterized by power-law or broken power-law\nbehavior up to very large fluxes for which central limit theorem does not hold,\nand leading to well-known stable laws as opposed Gaussian. We find that\nrelatively simple recipes provide a satisfactory description of the probability\nP({\\Psi}). We also find that a naive Gaussian fit to simulation results would\nunderestimate the probability of very large fluxes, that is, several times\nabove the average, while overestimating the probability of relatively milder\nexcursions. At large energies, large flux fluctuations are prevented by causal\nconsiderations, while at low energies a partial knowledge on the recent and\nnearby population of sources plays an important role. A few proposal have been\ndiscussed in the literature to account for spectral breaks recently reported in\ncosmic ray data in terms of local contributions. We apply our newly developed\ntheory to assess their probabilities, finding that they are relatively small.\n", "  The recent developments of electron quantum optics in quantum Hall edge\nchannels have given us new ways to probe the behavior of electrons in quantum\nconductors. It has brought new quantities called electronic coherences under\nthe spotlight. In this paper, we explore the relations between electron quantum\noptics and signal processing through a global review of the various methods for\naccessing single- and two-electron coherences in electron quantum optics. We\ninterpret electron quantum optics interference experiments as analog signal\nprocessing converting quantum signals into experimentally observable quantities\nsuch as current averages and correlations.\n  This point of view also gives us a procedure to obtain quantum information\nquantities from electron quantum optics coherences. We illustrate these ideas\nby discussing two mode entanglement in electron quantum optics. We also sketch\nhow signal processing ideas may open new perspectives for representing\nelectronic coherences in quantum conductors and understand the properties of\nthe underlying many-body electronic state.\n", "  Producing a usable semiconducting form of graphene has plagued the\ndevelopment of graphene electronics for nearly two decades. Now that new\npreparation methods have become available, graphene's intrinsic properties can\nbe measured and the search for semiconducting graphene has begun to produce\nresults. This is the case of the first graphene \"buffer\" layer grown on\nSiC(0001) presented in this work. We show, contrary to assumptions of the last\nforty years, that the buffer graphene layer is not commensurate with SiC. The\nnew modulated structure we've found resolves a long standing contradiction\nwhere ab initio calculations expect a metallic buffer, while experimentally it\nis found to be a semiconductor. Model calculations using the new incommensurate\nstructure show that the semiconducting $\\pi$-band character of the buffer comes\nfrom partially hybridized graphene incommensurate boundaries surrounding\nunperturbed graphene islands.\n", "  The available data on the $D\\overline{D}$ and inclusive hadronic cross\nsections in the $\\psi(3770)$ region from the BaBar, Belle, BES-II, CLEO and\nKEDR experiments have been analyzed assuming that systematic uncertainties on\ncross sections measured by different detectors are not correlated. Four\ntheoretical models predicting the $\\psi(3770)$ line shape were considered for\nthe $D\\overline{D}$ channel. All of them gave satisfactory description of the\ndata. The combined analysis of the $D\\overline{D}$ and inclusive hadronic\nchannel was performed using the model based on the vector dominance approach\nand accounting for the contribution of the $\\psi(2S)$ tail to the\n$D\\overline{D}$ cross section. The following values of the mass, total width,\nelectron width and decay probability to the non-$D\\overline{D}$ states were\nobtained: $M=3779.8 \\pm 0.6 ~\\text{MeV}, \\Gamma=25.8 \\pm 1.3 ~\\text{MeV} ,\n\\Gamma_{ee}=196 \\pm 18 ~\\text{eV}, \\mathcal{B}_{nD\\overline{D}}=0.164 \\pm\n0.049$, where the errors quoted include both statistical and dominant\nsystematic uncertainties.\n", "  From the study of long-range-interacting systems to the simulation of gauge\nfields, open-shell Lanthanide atoms with their large magnetic moment and narrow\noptical transitions open novel directions in the field of ultracold quantum\ngases. As for other atomic species, the magneto-optical trap (MOT) is the\nworking horse of experiments but its operation is challenging, due to the large\nelectronic spin of the atoms. Here we present an experimental study of\nnarrow-line Dysprosium MOTs. We show that the combination of radiation pressure\nand gravitational forces leads to a spontaneous polarization of the electronic\nspin. The spin composition is measured using a Stern-Gerlach separation of spin\nlevels, revealing that the gas becomes almost fully spin-polarized for large\nlaser frequency detunings. In this regime, we reach the optimal operation of\nthe MOT, with samples of typically $3\\times 10^8$ atoms at a temperature of\n15\\,$\\mu$K. The spin polarization reduces the complexity of the radiative\ncooling description, which allows for a simple model accounting for our\nmeasurements. We also measure the rate of density-dependent atom losses,\nfinding good agreement with a model based on light-induced Van der Waals\nforces. A minimal two-body loss rate $\\beta\\sim 2\\times10^{-11}\\,$cm$^{3}$/s is\nreached in the spin-polarized regime. Our results constitute a benchmark for\nthe experimental study of ultracold gases of magnetic Lanthanide atoms.\n", "  A method is proposed for finding the wave field components which are weakly\nsensitive to the sound speed perturbation in the ocean acoustic waveguides.\nSuch a component is formed by a narrow beam of rays whose spread in vertical\ndirection, up to the observation range, remains less than the vertical scale of\nperturbation. These rays pass through practically the same inhomogeneities and\ntherefore their phases acquire close increments. If the ray amplitudes vary\ninsignificantly, then (i) the stable component of the monochromatic field in\nthe perturbed and unperturbed waveguide differ by only a constant phase factor,\nand (ii) in the case of transient wave field the perturbation causes only an\nadditional time delay of the stable component as a whole. It is shown how the\nstable components can be selected from the total wave field using the field\nexpansions in coherent states or in normal modes. The existence of stable\ncomponents is demonstrated by numerical simulation of sound field in a deep\nwater waveguide. It turns out, that even though the assumptions (i) and (ii)\nare not met exactly, the stable components in the perturbed and unperturbed\nwaveguide are quite close.\n", "  We have obtained the perturbative expressions up to sixth order for the\nenergy of the bound state in a one dimensional, arbitrarily weak, short range\nfinite well, applying a method originally developed by Gat and Rosenstein Ref.\n[3]. The expressions up to fifth order reproduce the results already known in\nthe literature, while the sixth order had not been calculated before. As an\nillustration of our formulas we have applied them to two exactly solvable\nproblems and to a nontrivial problem.\n", "  A compact and robust laser system, based on a frequency-doubled telecom\nlaser, providing all the lasers needed for a rubidium cold atom interferometer\nusing optical lattices is presented. Thanks to an optical switch at 1.5 \\mu m\nand a dual-wavelength second harmonic generation system, only one laser\namplifier is needed for all the laser system. Our system delivers at 780 nm a\npower of 900 mW with a detuning of 110 GHz for the optical lattice and a power\nof 650 mW with an adjustable detuning between 0 and -1 GHz for the laser\ncooling, the detection and the Raman transitions.\n", "  We study a sample of six X-ray selected broad absorption line (BAL)\nquasi-stellar objects (QSOs) from the XMM-Newton Wide Angle Survey. All six\nobjects are classified as BALQSOs using the classic balnicity index, and\ntogether they form the largest sample of X-ray selected BALQSOs. We find\nevidence for absorption in the X-ray spectra of all six objects. An ionized\nabsorption model applied to an X-ray spectral shape that would be typical for\nnon-BAL QSOs (a power law with energy index alpha=0.98) provides acceptable\nfits to the X-ray spectra of all six objects. The optical to X-ray spectral\nindices, alpha_OX, of the X-ray selected BALQSOs, have a mean value of 1.69 +-\n0.05, which is similar to that found for X-ray selected and optically selected\nnon-BAL QSOs of similar ultraviolet luminosity. In contrast, optically-selected\nBALQSOs typically have much larger alpha_OX and so are characterised as being\nX-ray weak. The results imply that X-ray selection yields intrinsically X-ray\nbright BALQSOs, but their X-ray spectra are absorbed by a similar degree to\nthat seen in optically-selected BALQSO samples; X-ray absorption appears to be\nubiquitous in BALQSOs, but X-ray weakness is not. We argue that BALQSOs sit at\none end of a spectrum of X-ray absorption properties in QSOs related to the\ndegree of ultraviolet absorption in C IV 1550.\n", "  Motivated by the non-negligible dynamical backcoupling of the electroweak\ninteractions with the strong interaction during neutron star mergers, we study\nthe effects of the explicit breaking of C, P and flavor symmetry on the strong\nsector. The quark propagator is the simplest object which encodes the\nconsequences of these breakings. To asses the impact, we study the influence of\nespecially parity violation on the propagator for various masses. For this\npurpose the functional methods in form of Dyson-Schwinger-Equations are\nemployed. We find that explicit isospin breaking leads to a qualitative change\nof behavior even for a slight explicit breaking, which is in contrast to the\nexpectations from perturbation theory. Our results thus suggest that\nnon-perturbative backcoupling effects could be larger than expected.\n", "  We report on a template-stripping method for the direct surface patterning of\ncolloidal quantum-dot thin films to produce highly luminescent structures with\nfeature sizes less than 100 nm. Through the careful design of high quality\nbulls-eye gratings we can produce strong directional beaming (10{\\deg}\ndivergence) with up to six-fold out-coupling enhancement of spontaneous\nemission in the surface-normal direction. A transition to narrow single-mode\nlasing is observed in these same structures at thresholds as low as 120\n{\\mu}J/cm2. Furthermore, making use of the size-tunable character of colloidal\nquantum dots, we demonstrate spectrally selective out-coupling of light from\nmixed quantum-dot films. Our results provide a straightforward route towards\nsignificantly improved optical properties of colloidal quantum-dot assemblies.\n", "  In order to overcome the challenge of obtaining high modulation depth due to\nweak graphene-light interaction, a graphene-on-silicon nitride (SiNx) microring\nresonator based on graphene's gate-tunable optical conductivity is proposed and\nstudied. Geometrical parameters of graphene-on-SiNx waveguide are\nsystematically analyzed and optimized, yielding a loss tunability of 0.04\ndB/{\\mu}m and an effective index variation of 0.0022. We explicitly study the\ninteraction between graphene and a 40-{\\mu}m-radius microring resonator, where\nelectro-absorptive and electro-refractive modulation are both taken into\naccount. By choosing appropriate graphene coverage and coupling coefficient, a\nhigh modulation depth of over 40 dB with large fabrication tolerance is\nobtained.\n", "  Nanophotonic interfaces between single emitters and light promise to enable\nnew quantum optical technologies. Here, we use a combination of finite element\nsimulations and analytic quantum theory to investigate the interaction of\nvarious quantum emitters with slot-waveguide rings. We predict that for rings\nwith radii as small as 1.44 $\\mu$m (Q = 27,900), near-unity emitter-waveguide\ncoupling efficiencies and emission enhancements on the order of 1300 can be\nachieved. By tuning the ring geometry or introducing losses, we show that\nrealistic emitter-ring systems can be made to be either weakly or strongly\ncoupled, so that we can observe Rabi oscillations in the decay dynamics even\nfor micron-sized rings. Moreover, we demonstrate that slot waveguide rings can\nbe used to directionally couple emission, again with near-unity efficiency. Our\nresults pave the way for integrated solid-state quantum circuits involving\nvarious emitters.\n", "  We review various theoretical approaches for the equation of state (EoS) of\ndense matter, relevant for the description of core-collapse supernovae, compact\nstars and compact star mergers. The emphasis is put on models that are\napplicable to all of these scenarios. Such EoS models have to cover large\nranges in baryon number density, temperature and isospin asymmetry. The\ncharacteristics of matter change dramatically within these ranges, from a\nmixture of nucleons, nuclei, and electrons to uniform, strongly interacting\nmatter containing nucleons, and possibly other particles such as hyperons or\nquarks. As the development of an EoS requires joint efforts from many\ndirections we consider different theoretical approaches and discuss relevant\nexperimental and observational constraints which provide insights for future\nresearch. Finally, results from applications of the discussed EoS models are\nsummarized.\n", "  Recently, noncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd has attracted considerable\nresearch interest due to the possibility of hosting topological\nsuperconductivity. Here we report a systematic high-resolution angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study of the normal\nstate electronic and spin properties of BiPd. Our experimental results show the\npresence of a surface state at higher-binding energy with the location of Dirac\npoint at around 700 meV below the Fermi level. The detailed photon energy,\ntemperature-dependent and spin-resolved ARPES measurements complemented by our\nfirst principles calculations demonstrate the existence of the spin polarized\nsurface states at high-binding energy. The absence of such spin-polarized\nsurface states near the Fermi level negates the possibility of a topological\nsuperconducting behavior on the surface. Our direct experimental observation of\nspin-polarized surface states in BiPd provides critical information that will\nguide the future search for topological superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric\nmaterials.\n", "  In June 2013, the two scientific instruments onboard the second Sunrise\nmission witnessed, in detail, a small-scale magnetic flux emergence event as\npart of the birth of an active region. The Imaging Magnetograph Experiment\n(IMaX) recorded two small (~5 arcsec) emerging flux patches in the polarized\nfiltergrams of a photospheric Fe I spectral line. Meanwhile, the Sunrise Filter\nImager (SuFI) captured the highly dynamic chromospheric response to the\nmagnetic fields pushing their way through the lower solar atmosphere. The\nserendipitous capture of this event offers a closer look at the inner workings\nof active region emergence sites. In particular, it reveals in meticulous\ndetail how the rising magnetic fields interact with the granulation as they\npush through the Sun's surface, dragging photospheric plasma in their upward\ntravel. The plasma that is burdening the rising field slides along the field\nlines, creating fast downflowing channels at the footpoints. The weight of this\nmaterial anchors this field to the surface at semi-regular spatial intervals,\nshaping it in an undulatory fashion. Finally, magnetic reconnection enables the\nfield to release itself from its photospheric anchors, allowing it to continue\nits voyage up to higher layers. This process releases energy that lights up the\narch-filament systems and heats the surrounding chromosphere.\n", "  We present the complete derivation of the nuclear axial charge and current\noperators as well as the pseudoscalar operators to fourth order in the chiral\nexpansion relative to the dominant one-body contribution using the method of\nunitary transformation. We demonstrate that the unitary ambiguity in the\nresulting operators can be eliminated by the requirement of renormalizability\nand by matching of the pion-pole contributions to the nuclear forces. We give\nexpressions for the renormalized single-, two- and three-nucleon contributions\nto the charge and current operators and pseudoscalar operators including the\nrelevant relativistic corrections. We also verify explicitly the validity of\nthe continuity equation.\n", "  Dynamical mean field theory is used to study the quantum critical point (QCP)\nin the doped Hubbard model on a square lattice. The QCP is characterized by a\nuniversal scaling form of the self energy and a spin density wave instability\nat an incommensurate wave vector. The scaling form unifies the low energy kink\nand the high energy waterfall feature in the spectral function, while the spin\ndynamics includes both the critical incommensurate and high energy\nantiferromagnetic paramagnons. We use the frequency dependent four-point\ncorrelation function of spin operators to calculate the momentum dependent\ncorrection to the electron self energy. Our results reveal a substantial\ndifference with the calculations based on the Spin-Fermion model which\nindicates that the frequency dependence of the the quasiparitcle-paramagnon\nvertices is an important factor.\n", "  While thermal anisotropicity is a desirable materials property for many\napplications, including transverse thermoelectrics and thermal management in\nelectronic devices, it remains elusive in practical natural compounds. In this\nwork, we show how nanoporous materials with anisotropic pore lattices can be\nused as a platform for inducing strong heat transport directionality in\nisotropic materials. Using density functional theory and the phonon Boltzmann\ntransport equation, we calculate the phonon-size effects and thermal\nconductivity of nanoporous silicon with different anisotropicpore lattices. Our\ncalculations predict a strong directionality in the thermal conductivity,\ndictated by the difference in the pore-pore distances along the two Cartesian\naxes. As the space between pores along the direction of the applied temperature\ngradient represents the phonon bottleneck, an anisotropic pores lattice\ndistortion induces directionality in heat transport. Using Fourier's law, we\nalso compute diffusive heat transport for the same geometries obtaining\nsignificantly smaller anisotropicity, revealing the crucial role of phonon-size\neffects in tuning thermal transport directionality. Besides enhancing our\nunderstanding of nanoscale heat transport, our results demonstrate the promise\nof nanoporous materials for modulating anisotropy in thermal conductivity.\n", "  The importance of spatial non-locality in the description of negative\nrefraction in electromagnetic materials has been put forward recently. We\ndevelop a theory of negative refraction in homogeneous and isotropic media,\nbased on first principles, and that includes non-locality in its full\ngenerality. The theory shows that both dissipation and spatial non-locality are\nnecessary conditions for the existence of negative refraction. It also provides\na sufficient condition in materials with weak spatial non-locality. These\nfundamental results should have broad implications in the theoretical and\npractical analyses of negative refraction of electromagnetic and other kinds of\nwaves.\n", "  When particles settle through a stable temperature or salinity gradient they\ncan drive an instability known as sedimentary fingering convection. This\nphenomenon is thought to occur beneath sediment-rich river plumes in lakes and\noceans, in the context of marine snow where decaying organic materials serve as\nthe suspended particles, or in the atmosphere in the presence of aerosols or\nvolcanic ash. Laboratory experiments of Houk and Green (1973) and Green (1987)\nhave shown sedimentary fingering convection to be similar to the more commonly\nknown thermohaline fingering convection in many ways. Here, we study the\nphenomenon using 3D direct numerical simulations. We find evidence for layer\nformation in sedimentary fingering convection in regions of parameter space\nwhere it does not occur for non-sedimentary systems. This is due to two\ncomplementary effects. Sedimentation affects the turbulent fluxes and broadens\nthe region of parameter space unstable to the $\\gamma$-instability (Radko 2003)\nto include systems at larger density ratios. It also gives rise to a new\nlayering instability that exists in $\\gamma-$stable regimes. The former is\nlikely quite ubiquitous in geophysical systems for sufficiently large settling\nvelocities, while the latter probably grows too slowly to be relevant, at least\nin the context of sediments in water.\n", "  We construct the Supersymmetric Effective Field Theory of Inflation, that is\nthe most general theory of inflationary fluctuations when time-translations and\nsupersymmetry are spontaneously broken. The non-linear realization of these\ninvariances allows us to define a complete SUGRA multiplet containing the\ngraviton, the gravitino, the Goldstone of time translations and the Goldstino,\nwith no auxiliary fields. Going to a unitary gauge where only the graviton and\nthe gravitino are present, we write the most general Lagrangian built out of\nthe fluctuations of these fields, invariant under time-dependent spatial\ndiffeomorphisms, but softly-breaking time diffeomorphisms and gauged SUSY. With\na suitable St\\\"uckelberg transformation, we introduce the Goldstone boson of\ntime translation and the Goldstino of SUSY. No additional dynamical light field\nis needed. In the high energy limit, larger than the inflationary Hubble scale\nfor the Goldstino, these fields decouple from the graviton and the gravitino,\ngreatly simplifying the analysis in this regime. We study the phenomenology of\nthis Lagrangian. The Goldstino can have a non-relativistic dispersion relation.\nGravitino and Goldstino affect the primordial curvature perturbations at loop\nlevel. The UV modes running in the loops generate three-point functions which\nare degenerate with the ones coming from operators already present in the\nabsence of supersymmetry. Their size is potentially as large as corresponding\nto $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm equil.,\\,orthog.}\\sim 1$ or, for particular operators, even\n$\\gg 1$. The non-degenerate contribution from modes of order $H$ is estimated\nto be very small.\n", "  The ability to efficiently and accurately calculate equilibrium time\ncorrelation functions of many-body condensed phase quantum systems is one of\nthe outstanding problems in theoretical chemistry. The Nakajima-Zwanzig-Mori\nformalism coupled to the self-consistent solution of the memory kernel has\nrecently proven to be highly successful for the computation of nonequilibrium\ndynamical averages. Here, we extend this formalism to treat symmetrized\nequilibrium time correlation functions for the spin-boson model. Following the\nfirst paper in this series [A. Montoya-Castillo and D. R. Reichman, J. Chem.\nPhys. $\\bf{144}$, 184104 (2016)], we use a Dyson-type expansion of the\nprojected propagator to obtain a self-consistent solution for the memory kernel\nthat requires only the calculation of normally evolved auxiliary kernels. We\nemploy the approximate mean-field Ehrenfest method to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this approach. Via comparison with numerically exact results for\nthe correlation function $\\mathcal{C}_{zz}(t) = \\mathrm{Re}\\langle\n\\sigma_z(0)\\sigma_z(t)\\rangle$, we show that the current scheme affords\nremarkable boosts accuracy and efficiency over bare Ehrenfest dynamics. We\nfurther explore the sensitivity of the resulting dynamics to the type of kernel\nclosures and the accuracy of the initial canonical density operator.\n", "  We show that the curvature of nanomagnets can be used to induce chiral\ntextures in the magnetization field. Among the phenomena related to the\ninterplay between geometry and magnetic behavior at nanomagnets, an effective\ncurvature-induced chiral interaction has been recently predicted. In this work,\nit is shown that a magnetization configuration consisting of two structures\nwith opposite winding numbers (vortex and antivortex) appear as remanent states\nin hollow toroidal nanomagnets. It is shown that these topological\nconfigurations are a result of a chiral interaction induced by curvature. In\nthis way, the obtained results present a new form to produce stable vortices\nand antivortices by using nanomagnets with variable curvature.\n", "  The Heavy Photon Search experiment (HPS) is searching for a new gauge boson,\nthe so-called \"heavy photon.\" Through its kinetic mixing with the Standard\nModel photon, this particle could decay into an electron-positron pair. It\nwould then be detectable as a narrow peak in the invariant mass spectrum of\nsuch pairs, or, depending on its lifetime, by a decay downstream of the\nproduction target. The HPS experiment is installed in Hall-B of Jefferson Lab.\nThis article presents the design and performance of one of the two detectors of\nthe experiment, the electromagnetic calorimeter, during the runs performed in\n2015-2016. The calorimeter's main purpose is to provide a fast trigger and\nreduce the copious background from electromagnetic processes through matching\nwith a tracking detector. The detector is a homogeneous calorimeter, made of\n442 lead-tungstate (PbWO4) scintillating crystals, each read out by an\navalanche photodiode coupled to a custom trans-impedance amplifier.\n", "  Single electron sources enable electron quantum optics experiments where\nsingle electrons emitted in a ballistic electronic interferometer plays the\nrole of a single photons emitted in an optical medium in Quantum Optics. A\nqualitative step has been made with the recent generation of single charge\nlevitons obtained by applying Lorentzian voltage pulse on the contact of the\nquantum conductor. Simple to realize and operate, the source emits electrons in\nthe form of striking minimal excitation states called levitons. We review the\nstriking properties of levitons and their possible applications in quantum\nphysics to electron interferometry and entanglement. W Schematic generation of\ntime resolved single charges called levitons using Lorentzian voltage pulses\napplied on a contact. A Quantum Point Contact is used to partition the levitons\nfor further analysis. Injecting levitons on opposite contacts with a delay\n$\\\\tau$ enables to probe electronic like Hong Ou Mandel correlations. Copyright\nline will be provided by the publisher 1 Single electron sources In this\nintroduction, we will distinguish single charge sources from coherent single\nelectrons sources. The former have been developed for quantum metrology where\nthe goal is to transfer an integer charge at high frequency f through a\nconductor with good accuracy to realize a quantized current source whose\ncurrent I = ef shows metrological accuracy. The latter, the coherent single\nelectrons source, aims at emitting (injecting) a single electron whose\nwave-function is well defined and controlled to realize further single electron\ncoherent manipulation via quantum gates. The gates are provided by electronic\nbeam-splitters made with Quantum Point Contacts or provided by electronic\nMach-Zehnder and Fabry-Prot interferometers. Here it is important that the\ninjected single electron is the only excitation created in the conductor. The\nfrequency f of injection is not chosen to have a large current, as current\naccuracy is not the goal, but only to get sufficient statistics on the electron\ntransfer events to extract physical information. 1.1 single charge sources for\ncurrent standards The first manipulation of single charges trace back to the\nearly 90's where physicists took advantage of charge quan-tization of a\nsubmicronic metallic island nearly isolated from leads by tunnel barriers. The\nfinite energy E C = e 2 /2C to charge the small capacitor C with a single\ncharge being larger than temperature (typically one kelvin for\n", "  We briefly discuss some of the developments since the publication of the\nMMHT14 parton distributions. In particular we explore the impact of recent LHC\ndata for $W^\\pm,Z$ and $t\\bar{t}$ production, and perform a preliminary new\nanalysis including these data. In this re-fit (which we tentatively call\n`MMHT16') there are few changes of significance in the central values of the\nPDFs, but some data reduce the uncertainties, mainly in the strange and valence\nquark distributions. We find that an extended $\\bar{d}-\\bar{u}$ parametrization\nonly leads to minor changes, with the difference going to zero as $x \\to 0$. We\ncomment on the determination of the photon PDF.\n", "  We address the effect of nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions on the\ntopological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, with\nalternating hopping amplitudes t1 and t2. Both numerically and analytically, we\nshow that the presence of interactions induces phase transitions between\ntopologically different regimes. In the particular case of one-hole excitations\nin a half-filled SSH chain, the V=t2 vs. t1=t2 phase diagram has topological\nphases at diagonal regions of the phase plane. The interaction acts in this\ncase as a passivation potential. For general filling of the SSH chain,\ndifferent eigensubspaces of the SSH Hamiltonian may be classified as\ntopologically trivial and non-trivial. The two-hole case is studied in detail\nin the large interaction limit, and we show that a mapping can be constructed\nof the two-hole SSH eigensubspaces into one-particle states of a\nnon-interacting one-dimensional (1D) tight-binding model, with interfaces\nbetween regions with different hopping constants and local potentials. The\npresence of topological edge states in the equivalent chain can be readily\nidentifed, as well as their correspondence to the original two-hole states.\nFurthermore, we found that the presence of the NN interaction generates a state\nwhere two holes occupy two consecutive edge states. Such many-body states\nshould also occur for arbitrary filling leading to the possibility of a\nmacroscopic hole gathering at the surface (at consecutive edge states).\n", "  Frustrated quantum magnetism has moved to the forefront of physics research,\nposing fundamental questions concerning quantum disordered states,\nentanglement, topology and the nature of the quantum wavefunction. The defining\nproblem in the field is one of the simplest, the ground state of the\nnearest-neighbour $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome\nlattice, but has defied all theoretical and numerical methods employed to date.\nWe apply the formalism of tensor-network states (TNS), specifically the method\nof projected entangled simplex states (PESS), whose combination of a correct\naccounting for multipartite entanglement and infinite system size provides\nqualitatively new insight. By studying the ground-state energy, the staggered\nmagnetization we find at all finite tensor bond dimensions and the effects of a\nsecond-neighbour coupling, we demonstrate that the ground state is a gapless\nspin liquid. We discuss the comparison with other numerical studies and the\nphysical interpretation of the gapless ground state.\n", "  We present our approach for sharing photons and assessing resultant\nfour-photon visibility between two distant parties using concatenated\nentanglement swapping. In addition we determine the corresponding key\ngeneration rate and the quantum bit-error rate. Our model is based on practical\nlimitations of resources, including multipair parametric down-conversion\nsources, inefficient detectors with dark counts and lossy channels. Through\nthis approach, we have found that a trade-off is needed between experimental\nrun-time, pair-production rate and detector efficiency. Concatenated\nentanglement swapping enables huge distances for quantum key-distribution but\nat the expense of low key generation rate.\n", "  A general criterion is proposed and found to successfully predict the\nemergence of chirping oscillations of unstable Alfv\\'enic eigenmodes in tokamak\nplasma experiments. The model includes realistic eigenfunction structure,\ndetailed phase-space dependences of the instability drive, stochastic\nscattering and the Coulomb drag. The stochastic scattering combines the effects\nof collisional pitch angle scattering and micro-turbulence spatial diffusion.\nThe latter mechanism is essential to accurately identify the transition between\nthe fixed-frequency mode behavior and rapid chirping in tokamaks and to resolve\nthe disparity with respect to chirping observation in spherical and\nconventional tokamaks.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a task that we call symmetrization, in which a state\nof a quantum system, associated with a symmetry group, is transformed by a\nrandom unitary operation to a symmetric state. Each element of the unitary\nensemble is required to be symmetry preserving, in the sense that it keeps the\nset of symmetric states invariant. We consider an asymptotic limit of\ninfinitely many copies and vanishingly small error, and analyze the\nsymmetrizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required\nfor symmetrization. We prove that the symmetrizing cost of an arbitrary quantum\nstate is equal to the relative entropy of frameness, thereby providing it with\na direct operational meaning.\n", "  We propose a novel type of optomechanical coupling which enables a tripartite\ninteraction between a quantum emitter, an optical mode and a macroscopic\nmechanical oscillator. The interaction uses a mechanism we term mode field\ncoupling: mechanical displacement modifies the spatial distribution of the\noptical mode field, which in turn modulates the atom-photon coupling rate. In\nproperly designed multimode optomechanical systems, we can achieve situations\nin which mode field coupling is the only possible interaction pathway for the\nsystem. This enables, for example, swapping of a single excitation between\nemitter and phonon, creation of nonclassical states of motion and mechanical\nground-state cooling in the bad-cavity regime. Importantly, the emitter-phonon\ncoupling rate can be enhanced through an optical drive field, allowing active\ncontrol of strong atom-phonon coupling for realistic experimental parameters.\n", "  Perovskite solar cells (PSC) are shown to behave as coupled ionic-electronic\nconductors with strong evidence that the ionic environment moderates both the\nrate of electron-hole recombination and the band offsets in planar PSC.\nNumerous models have been presented to explain the behavior of perovskite solar\ncells, but to date no single model has emerged that can explain both the\nfrequency and time dependent response of the devices. Here we present a\nstraightforward coupled ionic-electronic model that can be used to explain the\nlarge amplitude transient behavior and the impedance response of PSC.\n", "  Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT), a candidate theory of nonperturbative\nquantum gravity in 4D, turns out to have a rich phase structure. We investigate\nthe recently discovered bifurcation phase $C_b$ and relate some of its\ncharacteristics to the presence of singular vertices of very high order. The\ntransition lines separating this phase from the \"time-collapsed\" $B$-phase and\nthe de Sitter phase $C_{dS}$ are of great interest when searching for physical\nscaling limits. The work presented here sheds light on the mechanisms behind\nthese transitions. First, we study how the $B$-$C_b$ transition signal depends\non the volume-fixing implemented in the simulations, and find results\ncompatible with the previously determined second-order character of the\ntransition. The transition persists in a transfer matrix formulation, where the\nsystem's time extension is taken to be minimal. Second, we relate the new\n$C_b$-$C_{dS}$ transition to the appearance of singular vertices, which leads\nto a direct physical interpretation in terms of a breaking of the homogeneity\nand isotropy observed in the de Sitter phase when crossing from $C_{dS}$ to the\nbifurcation phase $C_b$.\n", "  Growing the supermassive black holes (~10^9 Msun) that power the detected\nluminous, highest redshift quasars (z > 6) from light seeds - the remnants of\nthe first stars - within ~ 1 Gyr of the Big Bang poses a timing challenge for\ngrowth models. The formation of massive black hole seeds via direct collapse\nwith initial masses ~ 10^4 - 10^5 Msun alleviates this problem. Physical\nconditions required to form these massive direct collapse black hole (DCBH)\nseeds are available in the early universe. These viable DCBH formation sites,\nsatellite halos of star-forming galaxies, merge and acquire a stellar\ncomponent. These produce a new, transient class of objects at high redshift,\nObese Black hole Galaxies (OBGs), where the luminosity produced by accretion\nonto the black hole outshines the stellar component. Therefore, the OBG stage\noffers a unique way to discriminate between light and massive initial seeds. We\npredict the multi-wavelength energy output of OBGs and growing Pop III remnants\nat a fiducial redshift (z = 9), exploring both standard and slim disk accretion\nonto the growing central black hole for high and low metallicities of the\nassociated stellar population. With our computed templates, we derive the\nselection criteria for OBGs, that comprise a pre-selection that eliminates blue\nsources; followed by color-color cuts ([F_{070W} - F_{220W}] > 0; -0.3 <\n[F_{200W} - F_{444W}] < 0.3) and when available, a high ratio of X-ray flux to\nrest-frame optical flux (F_X/F_{444W} >> 1) (Abridged).\n", "  We explore parabolic pre-shaping as a means of generating and amplifying\nultrashort pulses. We develop a theoretical framework for modeling the\ntechnique and use its conclusions to design a femtosecond fiber amplifier.\nStarting from 9 ps pulses, we obtain 4.3 $\\mu$J, nearly transform-limited\npulses 275 fs in duration, simultaneously achieving over 40 dB gain and 33-fold\ncompression. Finally, we show that this amplification scheme is limited by\nRaman scattering, and outline a method by which the pulse duration and energy\nmay be further improved and tailored for a given application.\n", "  Applications of variational methods are typically restricted to conservative\nsystems. Some extensions to dissipative systems have been reported too but\nrequire ad hoc techniques such as the artificial doubling of the dynamical\nvariables. Here, a different approach is proposed. We show that, for a broad\nclass of dissipative systems of practical interest, variational principles can\nbe formulated using constant Lagrange multipliers and Lagrangians nonlocal in\ntime, which allow treating reversible and irreversible dynamics on the same\nfooting. A general variational theory of linear dispersion is formulated as an\nexample. In particular, we present a variational formulation for linear\ngeometrical optics in a general dissipative medium, which is allowed to be\nnonstationary, inhomogeneous, nonisotropic, and exhibit both temporal and\nspatial dispersion simultaneously.\n", "  A perturbative method called beatification is presented for a class of\ntwo-dimensional fluid and plasma theories. The Hamiltonian systems considered,\nnamely the Euler, Vlasov-Poisson, Hasegawa-Mima, and modified Hasegawa-Mima\nequations, are naturally described in terms of noncanonical variables. The\nbeatification procedure amounts to finding the correct transformation that\nremoves the explicit variable dependence from a noncanonical Poisson bracket\nand replaces it with a fixed dependence on a chosen state in phase space. As\nsuch, beatification is a major step toward casting the Hamiltonian system in\nits canonical form, thus enabling or facilitating the use of analytical and\nnumerical techniques that require or favor a representation in terms of\ncanonical, or beatified, Hamiltonian variables.\n", "  We report on a new design of terahertz quantum cascade laser based on a\nsingle, potential-inserted quantum well active region. The quantum well\nproperties are engineered through single monolayer InAs inserts. The modeling\nis based on atomistic, spds* tight-binding calculations, and performances are\ncompared to that of the classical three-well design. We obtain a 100% increase\nof the oscillator strength per unit length, while maintaining a high, nearly\ntemperature-independent contrast between phonon-induced relaxation times of the\nupper and lower lasing states. The improved performances are expected to allow\nTHz lasing at room temperature.\n", "  We study chaotic motion of classical closed strings in the five-dimensional\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) soliton spacetime. We first revisit classical chaos using\na cohomogeneity-1 string ansatz. We then consider turbulent behaviors of the\nclassical strings when the spatial dependence of the string world-sheet is\nincluded. Sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems suggests that\nthe string under chaos tends to stretch in the AdS soliton spacetime in a\nLyapunov timescale. In this process, the orbital angular momentum transfers to\ninternal spin due to the turbulence on the string. It follows that the string\nstays around the tip of the AdS soliton with a jumbled profile. We evaluate the\nspectra of conserved quantities and discuss their universal power-law scalings\nin the turbulent behaviors.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze a chain-linked triple-cavity photonic molecule\n(TCPM) with controllable coupling strengths between the cavities on their\nspectral properties and field (energy) distributions by solving eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix based on coupled mode theory. Phase\ntransition is extended from double-cavity photonic molecules (DCPMs) to TCPMs,\nand evolutions of the supermode frequencies and linewidths are analyzed, which\nhave synchronous relations with the degree of coherence between adjacent\noptical microcavities and energy distributions in the three cavities,\nrespectively. We develop a superposition picture for the three supermodes of\nthe TCPM, as interferences between supermodes of sub-DCPMs. In particular, we\ndemonstrate the abnormal properties of the central supermode in TCPMs, such as\ndark state in middle cavity and phase shift when energy flowing between side\ncavities, which are promising in information processing and remote control of\nenergy. General properties of TCPMs are summarized and limitation on linewidths\nare given. Finally, we make an interesting analog to intracavity\nelectromagnetically induced transparency in multi-level atomic systems using\nthe flexible TCPM platform under appropriate conditions.\n", "  We derive the expressions of photon energy and particle currents inside an\nopen nanosystem interacting with light using non-equilibrium Green's functions.\nThe model allows different temperatures for the electron reservoirs, which\nbasically defines a photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid. Thanks to these\nexpressions, we formulate the steady-state entropy production rate to assess\nthe efficiency of reversible photovoltaic-thermoelectric nanodevices. Next,\nquantum dot based nanojunctions are closely examined. We show that entropy\nproduction is always positive when one considers spontaneous emission of\nphotons with a specific energy, while in general the emission spectrum is\nbroadened, notably for strong coupling to reservoirs. In this latter case, when\nthe emission is integrated over all the energies of the spectrum, we find that\nentropy production can reach negative values. This result provides matter to\nquestion the second law of thermodynamics for interacting nanosystems beyond\nthe assumption of weak coupling.\n", "  We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for large $N$ conformal field\ntheories to have a universal free energy and an extended range of validity of\nthe higher-dimensional Cardy formula. These constraints are much tighter than\nin two dimensions and must be satisfied by any conformal field theory dual to\nEinstein gravity. We construct and analyze symmetric product orbifold theories\non $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and show that they only realize the necessary phase structure\nand extended range of validity if the seed theory is assumed to have a\nuniversal vacuum energy.\n", "  Tungsten is an important metal in nuclear fusion reactors. It will be used in\nthe divertor component of ITER (Latin for 'the way'). The Tungsten Project aims\nto calculate partial and total DR rate coefficients for the isonuclear sequence\nof Tungsten. The calculated data will be made available as and when they are\nproduced via the open access database OPEN- ADAS in the standard adf09 and\nadf48 file formats. We present our progress thus far, detailing calculational\nmethods, and showing comparisons with other available data. We conclude with\nplans for the future.\n", "  Multiple elliptic polylogarithms can be written as (multiple) integrals of\nproducts of basic hypergeometric functions. The latter are computable, to\narbitrary precision, using a q-difference equation and q-contiguous relations.\n", "  I briefly review the numerical evidence, some old and some quite recent, in\nfavor of the center vortex theory of confinement.\n", "  Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with\nsite-directed spin-labeling is a very powerful tool for elucidating the\nstructure and organization of biomolecules. Gd$^{3+}$ complexes have recently\nemerged as a new class of spin labels for distance determination by pulsed EPR\nspectroscopy at Q- and W-band. We present CW EPR measurements at 240 GHz (8.6\nTesla) on a series of Gd-rulers of the type Gd-PyMTA---spacer---Gd-PyMTA, with\nGd-Gd distances ranging from 1.2 nm to 4.3 nm. CW EPR measurements of these\nGd-rulers show that significant dipolar broadening of the central\n$|-1/2\\rangle\\rightarrow|1/2\\rangle$ transition occurs at 30 K for Gd-Gd\ndistances up to $\\sim$ 3.4 nm with Gd-PyMTA as the spin label. This represents\na significant extension for distances accessible by CW EPR, as nitroxide-based\nspin labels at X-band frequencies can typically only access distances up to\n$\\sim$ 2 nm. We show that this broadening persists at biologically relevant\ntemperatures above 200 K, and that this method is further extendable up to room\ntemperature by immobilizing the sample in glassy trehalose. We show that the\npeak-to-peak broadening of the central transition follows the expected $~1/r^3$\ndependence for the electron-electron dipolar interaction, from cryogenic\ntemperatures up to room temperature. A simple procedure for simulating the\ndependence of the lineshape on interspin distance is presented, in which the\nbroadening of the central transition is modeled as an $S=1/2$ spin whose CW EPR\nlineshape is broadened through electron-electron dipolar interactions with a\nneighboring $S=7/2$ spin.\n", "  Large area epitaxy of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials with high\nmaterial quality is a crucial step in realizing novel device applications based\non 2D materials. In this work, we report high-quality, crystalline, large-area\ngallium selenide (GaSe) films grown on bulk substrates such as c-plane sapphire\nand gallium nitride (GaN) using a valved cracker source for Se. (002)-oriented\nGaSe with random in-plane orientation of domains was grown on sapphire and GaN\nsubstrates at a substrate temperature of 350-450 C with complete surface\ncoverage and smooth surface morphology. Higher growth temperature (575 C)\nresulted in the formation of single-crystalline {\\epsilon}-GaSe triangular\ndomains with six-fold symmetry confirmed by in-situ reflection high electron\nenergy diffraction (RHEED) and off-axis x-ray diffraction (XRD). A two-step\ngrowth method involving high temperature nucleation of single crystalline\ndomains and low temperature growth to enhance coalescence was adopted to obtain\ncontinuous (002)-oriented GaSe with an epitaxial relationship with the\nsubstrate. While six-fold symmetry was maintained in the two step growth,\n{\\beta}-GaSe phase was observed in addition to the dominant {\\epsilon}-GaSe in\ncross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy images. This work\ndemonstrates the potential of growing high quality 2D-layered materials using\nmolecular beam epitaxy and can be extended to the growth of other transition\nmetal chalcogenides.\n", "  Many studies of quantum-size heat engines assume that the dynamics of an\ninternal system is unitary and that the extracted work is equal to the energy\nloss of the internal system. Both assumptions, however, should be under\nscrutiny. In the present paper, we analyze quantum-scale heat engines,\nemploying the measurement-based formulation of the work extraction recently\nintroduced by Hayashi and Tajima~[arXiv:1504.06150]. We first demonstrate the\ninappropriateness of the unitary time evolution of the internal system (namely\nthe first assumption above) using a simple two-level system; we show that the\nvariance of the energy transferred to an external system diverges when the\ndynamics of the internal system is approximated to a unitary time evolution. We\nsecond derive the quantum Jarzynski equality based on the formulation of\nHayashi and Tajima as a relation for the work measured by an external\nmacroscopic apparatus. The right-hand side of the equality reduces to unity for\n\"natural\" cyclic processes, but fluctuates wildly for non-cyclic ones,\nexceeding unity often. This fluctuation should be detectable in experiments and\nprovide evidence for the present formulation.\n", "  It is proposed to identify a strong electric field - created during\nrelativistic collisions of asymmetric nuclei - via the observation of\npseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of hadrons with the same\nmass but opposite charge. The results of detailed calculations within the\nParton-Hadron String Dynamics (PHSD) approach for the charge-dependent directed\nflow $v_1$ are presented for semi-central Cu+Au collision at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV incorporating the inverse Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal\n(iLPM) effect, which accounts for a delay in the electromagnetic interaction\nwith the charged degree of freedom. Including the iLPM effect we achieve a\nreasonable agreement of the PHSD results for the charge splitting in $v_1(p_T)$\nin line with the recent measurements of the STAR Collaboration for Cu+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV while an instant appearance and coupling\nof electric charges at the hard collision vertex overestimates the splitting by\nabout a factor of 10. We predict that the iLPM effect should practically\ndisappear at energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx$9 GeV, which should lead to a\nsignificantly larger charge splitting of $v_1$ at the future FAIR/NICA\nfacilities.\n", "  Dyson--Schwinger equations are an established, powerful non-perturbative tool\nfor QCD. In the Hamiltonian formulation of a quantum field theory they can be\nused to perform variational calculations with non-Gaussian wave functionals. By\nmeans of the DSEs the various $n$-point functions, needed in expectation values\nof observables like the Hamilton operator, can be thus expressed in terms of\nthe variational kernels of our trial ansatz. Equations of motion for these\nvariational kernels are derived by minimizing the energy density and solved\nnumerically.\n", "  It is generally expected that heavy fields are present during inflation,\nwhich can leave their imprint in late-time cosmological observables. The main\nsignature of these fields is a small amount of distinctly shaped\nnon-Gaussianity, which if detected, would provide a wealth of information about\nthe particle spectrum of the inflationary Universe. Here we investigate to what\nextent these signatures can be detected or constrained using futuristic 21-cm\nsurveys. We construct model-independent templates that extract the\nsqueezed-limit behavior of the bispectrum, and examine their overlap with\nstandard inflationary shapes and secondary non-Gaussianities. We then use these\ntemplates to forecast detection thresholds for different masses and couplings\nusing a 3D reconstruction of modes during the dark ages ($z\\sim 30-100$). We\nconsider interactions of several broad classes of models and quantify their\ndetectability as a function of the baseline of a dark ages interferometer. Our\nanalysis shows that there exists the tantalizing possibility of discovering new\nparticles with different masses and interactions with future 21-cm surveys.\n", "  The fractal nature of graphs has traditionally been investigated by using the\nnodes of networks as the basic units. Here, instead, we propose to concentrate\non the graph edges, and introduce a practical and computationally not demanding\nmethod for revealing changes in the fractal behavior of networks, and\nparticularly for allowing distinction between mono-fractal, quasi mono-fractal,\nand multi-fractal structures. We show that degree homogeneity plays a crucial\nrole in determining the fractal nature of the underlying network, and report on\nsix different protein-protein interaction networks along with their\ncorresponding random networks. Our analysis allows to identify varying levels\nof complexity in the species.\n", "  Using numerical and perturbative methods, we construct the first examples of\nblack hole solutions in Einsteinian cubic gravity and study their\nthermodynamics. Focusing first on four dimensional solutions, we show that\nthese black holes have a novel equation of state in which the pressure is a\nquadratic function of the temperature. Despite this, they undergo a first order\nphase transition with associated van der Waals behaviour. We then construct\nperturbative solutions for general $D \\ge 5$ and study the properties of these\nsolutions for $D=5$ and $D=6$ in particular. We note that for $D >4$ the\nsolutions are described by two independent metric functions. We find novel\nexamples of super-entropic behaviour over a large portion of the parameter\nspace. We analyse the specific heat, determining that the black holes are\nthermodynamically stable over large regions of parameter space.\n", "  In order to facilitate IR absorption measurements of mass-selected ions\nisolated in cryogenic matrices, we have upgraded an ion beam deposition\napparatus encompassing a Bruker IFS66v/S FTIR spectrometer. A synthetic diamond\nbeam splitter without compensator plate and UHV diamond viewports were\ninstalled. We have also modified the IR detector chamber to allow measurements\nwith 5 different detectors. As a result we can now obtain FT absorption spectra\nfrom 12000 cm$^{-1}$ to 15 cm$^{-1}$ with the same sample held under ultrahigh\nvacuum conditions, simply by switching between appropriate IR detectors. We\ndemonstrate performance of the upgraded FTIR spectrometer by presenting\nmeasurements of matrix isolated fullerene ions and an adhesive tape.\n", "  The so far only known charmed non-strange scalar meson is dubbed as\n$D_0^*(2400)$ in the Review of Particle Physics. We show, within the framework\nof unitarized chiral perturbation theory, that there are in fact two $(I=1/2,\nJ^P=0^+)$ poles in the region of the $D_0^*(2400)$ in the coupled-channel\n$D\\pi$, $D\\eta$ and $D_s\\bar K$ scattering amplitudes. With all the parameters\npreviously fixed, we predict the energy levels for the coupled-channel system\nin a finite volume, and find that they agree remarkably well with recent\nlattice QCD calculations. This successful description of the lattice data is\nregarded as a strong evidence for the two-pole structure of the $D_0^*(2400)$.\nWith the physical quark masses, the poles are located at\n$\\left(2105^{+6}_{-8}-i\\,102^{+10}_{-12}\\right)$~MeV and\n$\\left(2451^{+36}_{-26}-i\\,134^{+7}_{-8}\\right)$~MeV, with the largest\ncouplings to the $D\\pi$ and $D_s\\bar K$ channels, respectively. Since the\nhigher pole is close to the $D_s\\bar K$ threshold, we expect it to show up as a\nthreshold enhancement in the $D_s\\bar K$ invariant mass distribution. This\ncould be checked by high-statistic data in future experiments. We also show\nthat the lower pole belongs to the same SU(3) multiplet as the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$\nstate. Predictions for partners in the bottom sector are also given.\n", "  The two binary black-hole (BBH) coalescences detected by LIGO, GW150914 and\nGW151226, were relatively nearby sources, with a redshift of ~0.1. As the\nsensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Virgo increases in the next few years, they\nwill eventually detect stellar-mass BBHs up to redshifts of ~1. However, these\nare still relatively small distances compared with the size of the Universe, or\nwith those encountered in most areas of astrophysics. In order to study BBH\nduring the epoch of reionization, or black holes born from population III\nstars, more sensitive instruments are needed. Third-generation\ngravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic\nExplorer are already in an advanced R&D stage. These detectors will be roughly\na factor of 10 more sensitive in strain than the current generation, and be\nable to detect BBH mergers beyond a redshift of 20. In this paper we quantify\nthe precision with which these new facilities will be able to estimate the\nparameters of stellar-mass, heavy, and intermediate-mass BBH as a function of\ntheir redshifts and the number of detectors. We show that having only two\ndetectors would result in relatively poor estimates of black hole intrinsic\nmasses; a situation improved with three or four instruments. Larger\nimprovements are visible for the sky localization, although it is not yet clear\nwhether BBHs are luminous in the electromagnetic or neutrino band. The\nmeasurement of the spin parameters, on the other hand, do not improve\nsignificantly as more detectors are added to the network since redshift\ninformation are not required to measure spin.\n", "  DC current induced magnetization reversal and magnetization oscillation was\nobserved in 500 nm large size Co90Fe10/Cu/Ni80Fe20 pillars. A perpendicular\nexternal field enhanced the coercive field separation between the reference\nlayer (Co90Fe10) and free layer (Ni80Fe20) in the pseudo spin valve, allowing a\nlarge window of external magnetic field for exploring the free-layer reversal.\nThe magnetization precession was manifested in terms of the multiple peaks on\nthe differential resistance curves. Depending on the bias current and applied\nfield, the regions of magnetic switching and magnetization precession on a\ndynamical stability diagram has been discussed in details. Micromagnetic\nsimulations are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results and\nprovide insight for synchronization of inhomogenieties in large sized device.\nThe ability to manipulate spin-dynamics on large size devices could prove\nuseful for increasing the output power of the spin-transfer nano-oscillators\n(STNOs).\n", "  We assemble charged colloidal spheres at deliberately chosen locations on a\ncharged unstructured glass substrate utilizing ion exchange based\nelectro-osmotic micro-pumps. Using microscopy, a simple scaling theory and\nBrownian Dynamics simulations, we systematically explore the control parameters\nof crystal assembly and the mechanisms through which they depend on the\nexperimental boundary conditions. We demonstrate that crystal quality depends\ncrucially on the assembly distance of the colloids. This is understood as\nresulting from the competition between inward transport by the electro-osmotic\npump flow and the electro-phoretic outward motion of the colloids. Optimized\nconditions include substrates of low and colloids of large electro-kinetic\nmobility. Then a sorting of colloids by size is observed in binary mixtures\nwith larger particles assembling closer to the ion exchanger beads. Moreover,\nmono-sized colloids form defect free single domain crystals which grow outside\na colloid-free void with facetted inner crystal boundaries centred on the ion\nexchange particle. This works remarkably well, even with irregularly formed ion\nexchange resin splinters.\n", "  Using the generalized symmetry method, we carry out, up to autonomous point\ntransformations, the classification of integrable equations of a subclass of\nthe autonomous five-point differential-difference equations. This subclass\nincludes such well-known examples as the Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky and the\ndiscrete Sawada-Kotera equations. The resulting list contains 17 equations some\nof which seem to be new. We have found non-point transformations relating most\nof the resulting equations among themselves and their generalized symmetries.\n", "  While phase transitions between magnetic analogs of three states of matter\n--- a long-range ordered state, paramagnet, and spin liquid --- have been\nextensively studied, the possibility of \"liquid-liquid\" transitions, namely,\nbetween different spin liquids, remains elusive. By introducing the additional\nIsing coupling into the honeycomb Kitaev model with bond asymmetry, we discover\nthat the Kitaev spin liquid turns into a spin-nematic quantum paramagnet before\na magnetic order is established by the Ising coupling. The quantum phase\ntransition between the two liquid states accompanies a topological change\ndriven by fractionalized excitations, the $Z_2$ gauge fluxes, and is of first\norder. At finite temperatures, this yields a persisting first-order transition\nline that terminates at a critical point located deep inside the regime where\nquantum spins are fractionalized. It is suggested that similar transitions may\noccur in other perturbed Kitaev magnets with bond asymmetry.\n", "  Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) has been investigated in Pt/NiO/YIG\nstructures in a wide range of temperature and NiO thickness. The SMR shows a\nnegative sign below a temperature which increases with the NiO thickness. This\nis contrary to a conventional SMR theory picture applied to Pt/YIG bilayer\nwhich always predicts a positive SMR. The negative SMR is found to persist even\nwhen NiO blocks the spin transmission between Pt and YIG, indicating it is\ngoverned by the spin current response of NiO layer. We explain the negative SMR\nby the NiO 'spin-flop' coupled with YIG, which can be overridden at higher\ntemperatures by positive SMR contribution from YIG. This highlights the role of\nmagnetic structure in antiferromagnets for transport of pure spin current in\nmultilayers.\n", "  As a clear signature of modern urban design concepts, urban street networks\nin dense populated zones are evolving nowadays towards grid-like layouts with\nrectangular shapes, and most studies on traffic flow assume street networks as\nsquare lattices. However, ideas from forgotten design schools bring unexplored\nalternatives that might improve traffic flow in many circumstances. Inspired on\nan old and almost in oblivion urban plan, we report the behavior of the\nBiham-Middleton-Levine model (BML) \\-- a paradigm for studying phase\ntransitions of traffic flow \\-- on a hypothetical city with a perfect honeycomb\nstreet network. In contrast with the original BML model on a square lattice,\nthe same model on a honeycomb does not show any anisotropy or intermediate\nstates, but a single continuous phase transition between free and totally\ncongested flow, a transition that can be completely characterized by the tools\nof classical percolation. Although the transition occurs at a lower density\nthan for the conventional BML, simple modifications, like randomly stopping the\ncars with a very small probability or increasing the traffic light periods,\ndrives the model to perform better on honeycomb lattices. As traffic lights and\ndisordered perturbations are inherent to real traffic, these results question\nthe actual role of the square grid-like designs and suggests the honeycombs as\nan interesting alternative for urban planning in real cities.\n", "  The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light has recently attracted a growing\ninterest as a new degree of freedom in order to increase the information\ncapacity of today optical networks both for free-space and optical fiber\ntransmission. Here we present our work of design, fabrication and optical\ncharacterization of diffractive optical elements for compact OAM-mode division\ndemultiplexing based on optical transformations. Samples have been fabricated\nwith 3D high-resolution electron beam lithography on polymethylmethacrylate\n(PMMA) resist layer spun over a glass substrate. Their high compactness and\nefficiency make these optical devices promising for integration into\nnext-generation platforms for OAM-modes processing in telecom applications.\n", "  These are excerpts from the closing talk at the \"XIIth Conference on Quark\nConfinement and the Hadron Spectrum\", which took place last Summer in\nThessaloniki --an excellent place to enjoy an interest in archeology. A more\ncomplete personal view of the early days of QCD and the rest of the Standard\nModel is given in [1]. Here I discuss a few of the points which --to my\njudgement-- illustrate well the QCD evolution (in time), both from a scientific\nand a sociological point of view.\n", "  We study the relation between mesogranular flows, convectively driven sinks\nand magnetic fields using high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric data\nacquired with the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment on board Sunrise. We obtain\nthe horizontal velocity flow fields of two quiet-Sun regions (31.2 $\\times$\n31.2 Mm$^{2}$) via local correlation tracking. Mesogranular lanes and the\ncentral position of sinks are identified using Lagrange tracers. We find\n$6.7\\times10^{-2}$ sinks per Mm$^{2}$ in the two observed regions. The sinks\nare located at the mesogranular vertices and turn out to be associated with (1)\nhorizontal velocity flows converging to a central point and (2) long-lived\ndowndrafts. The spatial distribution of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun is\nalso examined. The strongest magnetic fields are preferentially located at\nsinks. We find that 40 \\% of the pixels with longitudinal component of the\nmagnetic field stronger than 500 G are located in the close neighborhood of\nsinks. In contrast, the small-scale magnetic loops detected by Mart\\'{i}nez\nGonz\\'{a}lez et al. in the same two observed areas do not show any preferential\ndistribution at mesogranular scales. The study of individual examples reveals\nthat sinks can play an important role in the evolution of quiet-Sun magnetic\nfeatures.\n", "  Proposed dark matter detectors with eV-scale sensitivities will detect a\nlarge background of atomic (nuclear) recoils from coherent photon scattering.\nThis background climbs steeply below $\\sim10$~eVnr, far exceeding the declining\nrate of low-energy Compton recoils. The upcoming generation of dark matter\ndetectors will not be limited by this background, but further development of\neV-scale and sub-eV detectors will require the use of low-$Z$ target materials,\nsuch as helium, to avoid a large rate of coherent photon scattering, or highly\nefficient methods to reject photons when they scatter.\n", "  We classify the rare events of structured, memoryful stochastic processes and\nuse this to analyze sequential and parallel generators for these events. Given\na stochastic process, we introduce a method to construct a new process whose\ntypical realizations are a given process' rare events. This leads to an\nexpression for the minimum memory required to generate rare events. We then\nshow that the recently discovered classical-quantum ambiguity of simplicity\nalso occurs when comparing the structure of process fluctuations.\n", "  The relative importance of the contributions of droplet excitations and\ndomain walls on the ordering of short-range Edwards-Anderson spin glasses in\nthree and four dimensions is studied. We compare the overlap distributions of\nperiodic and free boundary conditions using population annealing Monte Carlo.\nFor system sizes up to about 1000 spins, spin glasses show non-trivial spin\noverlap distributions. Periodic boundary conditions can trap diffusive domain\nwalls which can contribute to small spin overlaps, and the other contribution\nis the existence of low-energy droplet excitations within the system. We use\nfree boundary conditions to minimize domain-wall effects, and show that\nlow-energy droplet excitations are the major contribution to small overlaps in\nnumerical simulations. Free boundary conditions has stronger finite-size\neffects, and is likely to have the same thermodynamic limit with periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  In this work, we present electronic and magnetic properties of CaMnO3 (CMO)\nas obtained from ab initio calculations. We identify the preferable magnetic\norder by means of density functional theory plus Hubbard U calculations and\nextract the effective exchange parameters (Jij's) using the magnetic force\ntheorem. We find that the effects of geometrical relaxation at the surface as\nwell as the change of crystal field are very strong and are able to influence\nthe lower energy magnetic configuration. In particular, our analysis reveals\nthat the exchange interaction between the Mn atoms belonging to the surface and\nthe subsurface layers is very sensitive to the structural changes. An earlier\nstudy [A. Filippetti and W.E. Pickett, Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 4184 (1999)]\nsuggested that this coupling is ferromagnetic and gives rise to the spin flip\nprocess on the surface of CMO. In our work we confirm their finding for an\nunrelaxed geometry, but once the structural relaxations are taken into account,\nthis exchange coupling changes its sign. Thus, we suggest that the surface of\nCMO should have the same G-type antiferromagnetic order as in the bulk.\nFinally, we show that the suggested SF can be induced in the system by\nintroducing an excess of electrons.\n", "  A new muon beamline, muon science innovative channel (MuSIC), was set up at\nthe Research Centre for Nuclear Physics (RCNP), Osaka University, in Osaka,\nJapan, using the 392 MeV proton beam impinging on a target. The production of\nan intense muon beam relies on the efficient capture of pions, which\nsubsequently decay to muons, using a novel superconducting solenoid magnet\nsystem. After the pion-capture solenoid the first $36^\\circ$ of the curved muon\ntransport line was commissioned and the muon flux was measured. In order to\ndetect muons, a target of either copper or magnesium was placed to stop muons\nat the end of the muon beamline. Two stations of plastic scintillators located\nupstream and downstream from the muon target were used to reconstruct the decay\nspectrum of muons. In a complementary method to detect negatively-charged\nmuons, the X-ray spectrum yielded by muonic atoms in the target were measured\nin a germanium detector. Measurements, at a proton beam current of 6 pA,\nyielded $(10.4 \\pm 2.7) \\times 10^5$ muons per Watt of proton beam power\n($\\mu^+$ and $\\mu^-$), far in excess of other facilities. At full beam power\n(400 W), this implies a rate of muons of $(4.2 \\pm 1.1) \\times 10^8$ muons\ns$^{-1}$, amongst the highest in the world. The number of $\\mu^-$ measured was\nabout a factor of 10 lower, again by far the most efficient muon beam produced.\nThe set up is a prototype for future experiments requiring a high-intensity\nmuon beam, such as a muon collider or neutrino factory, or the search for rare\nmuon decays which would be a signature for phenomena beyond the Standard Model\nof particle physics. Such a muon beam can also be used in other branches of\nphysics, nuclear and condensed matter, as well as other areas of scientific\nresearch.\n", "  We point out that the transition probabilities used in a recent perturbative\ncalculation of pair creation in an external magnetic field in the expanding de\nSitter space with the $in$ and $out$ fermion states defined by the Bunch-Davies\nmodes [C. Crucean et al., Phys. Rev. D 73 044019 (20016)] are gauge dependent\nquantities. We examine the gauge variations of these amplitudes assuming a\ndecoupling of the interaction at infinite times, which allows to conclude that\nthe source of the problem lies in the nonoscillatory behavior of the fermion\ncurrent in the infinite future.\n", "  Understanding quantum dynamics away from equilibrium is an outstanding\nchallenge in the modern physical sciences. It is well known that\nout-of-equilibrium systems can display a rich array of phenomena, ranging from\nself-organized synchronization to dynamical phase transitions. More recently,\nadvances in the controlled manipulation of isolated many-body systems have\nenabled detailed studies of non-equilibrium phases in strongly interacting\nquantum matter. As a particularly striking example, the interplay of periodic\ndriving, disorder, and strong interactions has recently been predicted to\nresult in exotic \"time-crystalline\" phases, which spontaneously break the\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Here, we report the\nexperimental observation of such discrete time-crystalline order in a driven,\ndisordered ensemble of $\\sim 10^6$ dipolar spin impurities in diamond at\nroom-temperature. We observe long-lived temporal correlations at integer\nmultiples of the fundamental driving period, experimentally identify the phase\nboundary and find that the temporal order is protected by strong interactions;\nthis order is remarkably stable against perturbations, even in the presence of\nslow thermalization. Our work opens the door to exploring dynamical phases of\nmatter and controlling interacting, disordered many-body systems.\n", "  We present a framework where dark matter interacts with the Standard Model\nthrough a light, spin-0 mediator that couples chirally to pairs of\ndifferent-flavor leptons. This flavor violating final state weakens bounds on\nnew physics coupled to leptons from terrestrial experiments and cosmic-ray\nmeasurements. As an example, we apply this framework to construct a model for\nthe Fermi-LAT excess of GeV $\\gamma$-rays from the galactic center. We comment\non the viability of this portal for self-interacting dark matter explanations\nof small scale structure anomalies and embeddings in flavor models. Models of\nthis type are shown to be compatible with the muon anomalous magnetic moment\nanomaly. We review current experimental constraints and identify possible\nfuture theoretical and experimental directions.\n", "  Dissipative Kerr solitons are self-sustaining optical wavepackets in\nresonators. They use the Kerr nonlinearity to both compensate dispersion and to\noffset optical loss. Besides providing insights into nonlinear resonator\nphysics, they can be applied in frequency metrology, precision clocks, and\nspectroscopy. Like other optical solitons, the dissipative Kerr soliton can\nradiate power in the form of a dispersive wave through a process that is the\noptical analogue of Cherenkov radiation. Dispersive waves typically consist of\nan ensemble of optical modes. A limiting case is demonstrated in which the\ndispersive wave is concentrated into a single cavity mode. In this limit, its\ninteraction with the soliton is shown to induce bistable behavior in the\nspectral and temporal properties of the soliton. Also, an operating point of\nenhanced repetition-rate stability is predicted and observed. The single-mode\ndispersive wave can therefore provide quiet states of soliton comb operation\nuseful in many applications.\n", "  Glass transition temperatures (Tg) and liquid fragilities are measured along\na line of constant Ge content in the system Ge-As-Te, and contrasted with the\nlack of glass-forming ability in the twin system Ge-Sb-Te at the same Ge\ncontent. The one composition established as free of crystal contamination in\nthe latter system shows a behavior opposite to that of more covalent system.\nComparison of Tg vs bond density in the three systems Ge-As-chalcogen differing\nin chalcogen i.e. S, Se, or Te, shows that as the chalcogen becomes more\nmetallic, i.e. in the order S<Se<Te the bond density effect on Tg becomes\nsystematically weaker, with a crossover at <r> = 2.3. When the more metallic Sb\nreplaces As at <r> greater than 2.3, incipient metallicity rather than\ndirectional bond covalency apparently gains control of the physics. This leads\nus to an examination of the electronic conductivity and, then,\nsemiconductor-to-metal (SC-M) transitions, with their associated thermodynamic\nmanifestations, in relevant liquid alloys. The thermodynamic components, as\nseen previously, control liquid fragility and cause fragile-to-strong\ntransitions during cooling. We tentatively conclude that liquid state behavior\nin phase change materials (PCMs) is controlled by liquid-liquid (SC-M)\ntransitions that have become submerged below the liquidus surface. In the case\nof the Ge-Te binary, a crude extrapolation to GeTe stoichiometry indicates that\nthe SC-M transition lies about 20% below the melting point, suggesting a\nparallel with the intensely researched \"hidden liquid-liquid (LL) transition\",\nin supercooled water. In the water case, superfast crystallization initiates in\nthe high fragility domain some 4% above the TLL which is located at ~15% below\nthe (ambient pressure) melting point.\n", "  Transfer entropy has been used to quantify the directed flow of information\nbetween source and target variables in many complex systems. While transfer\nentropy was originally formulated in discrete time, in this paper we provide a\nframework for considering transfer entropy in continuous time systems, based on\nRadon-Nikodym derivatives between measures of complete path realizations. To\ndescribe the information dynamics of individual path realizations, we introduce\nthe pathwise transfer entropy, the expectation of which is the transfer entropy\naccumulated over a finite time interval. We demonstrate that this formalism\npermits an instantaneous transfer entropy rate. These properties are analogous\nto the behavior of physical quantities defined along paths such as work and\nheat. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer entropy\nfor pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the specific case\nof point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model neural spike\ntrains). Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model examples to\nexhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely, that the information\nflow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at\nspikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying contribution\n(relating to waiting times between target spikes). Numerical schemes based on\nour formalism promise significant benefits over existing strategies based on\ndiscrete time formalisms.\n", "  In noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs), the inversion symmetry (IS) is\nmost commonly broken by an antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (SOC) removing the\nspin degeneracy and splitting the Fermi surface (FS) into two branches. A two\ncomponent condensate is then produced with a doublet pair potential mixing an\neven singlet and an odd triplet. When the triplet and the singlet strengths are\ncomparable, the pair potential can have rich nodes. The angular line nodes\n(ALNs) are associated with strong anisotropy and they are widely studied in the\nliterature. When the anisotropy is not strong, they can be replaced by other\ntypes of nodes in closed or open forms affecting the low temperature\nproperties.\n  Here, we focus on the weakly anisotropic case and the line nodes in the\nsuperconducting plane which become circular in the limit of full isotropy. We\nstudy the topology of these radial line nodes (RLNs) and show that it is\ncharacterized by the $Z_2$ classification similar to the Quantum-Spin-Hall\nInsulators. From the thermodynamical perspective, the RLNs cause, even in the\ntopological phases, an exponentially suppressed low temperature behaviour which\ncan be mistaken by nodeless s-wave pairing, thus, providing an explanation to a\nnumber of recent experiments with contraversial pairing symmetries. In the rare\ncase when the RLN is on the Fermi surface, the exponential suppression is\nreplaced by a linear temperature dependence. The RLNs are difficult to detect,\nand for this reason, they may have escaped experimental attention. We\ndemonstrate that Andreev conductance measurements with clean interfaces can\nefficiently probe the weakly anisotropic samples where the RLNs are expected to\nbe found.\n", "  The Anode Hydrogen Release (AHR) mechanism at interfaces is responsible for\nthe generation of defects, that traps charge carriers and can induce dielectric\nbreakdown in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors. The AHR has\nbeen extensively studied at Si/SiO$_2$ interfaces but its characteristics at\nmetal-silica interfaces remain unclear. In this study, we performed Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) calculations to study the hydrogen release mechanism at\nthe typical Al/SiO$_2$ metal-oxide interface. We found that interstitial\nhydrogen atoms can break interfacial Al-Si bonds, passivating a Si $sp^3$\norbital. Interstitial hydrogen atoms can also break interfacial Al-O bonds, or\nbe adsorbed at the interface on aluminum, forming stable Al-H-Al bridges. We\nshowed that hydrogenated O-H, Si-H and Al-H bonds at the Al/SiO$_2$ interfaces\nare polarized. The resulting bond dipole weakens the O-H and Si-H bonds, but\nstrengthens the Al-H bond under the application of a positive bias at the metal\ngate. Our calculations indicate that Al-H bonds and O-H bonds are more\nimportant than Si-H bonds for the hydrogen release process.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the structural and magnetic properties of\ntwo branches of the rare earth Tripod Kagome Lattice (TKL) family\nA$_{2}$RE$_{3}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$ (A = Mg, Zn; RE = Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er,\nYb; here, we use abbreviation \\textit{A-RE}, as in \\textit{MgPr} for\nMg$_{2}$Pr$_{3}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$), which complements our previously reported\nwork on \\textit{MgDy}, \\textit{MgGd}, and \\textit{MgEr} \\cite{TKL}. The present\nsusceptibility ($\\chi_{dc}$, $\\chi_{ac}$) and specific heat measurements reveal\nvarious magnetic ground states, including the non-magnetic singlet state for\n\\textit{MgPr}, \\textit{ZnPr}; long range orderings (LROs) for \\textit{MgGd},\n\\textit{ZnGd}, \\textit{MgNd}, \\textit{ZnNd}, and \\textit{MgYb}; a long range\nmagnetic charge ordered state for \\textit{MgDy}, \\textit{ZnDy}, and potentially\nfor \\textit{MgHo}; possible spin glass states for \\textit{ZnEr}, \\textit{ZnHo};\nthe absence of spin ordering down to 80 mK for \\textit{MgEr}, \\textit{MgTb},\n\\textit{ZnTb}, and \\textit{ZnYb} compounds. The ground states observed here\nbear both similarities as well as striking differences from the states found in\nthe parent pyrochlore systems. In particular, while the TKLs display a greater\ntendency towards LRO, the lack of LRO in \\textit{MgHo}, \\textit{MgTb} and\n\\textit{ZnTb} can be viewed from the standpoint of a balance among spin-spin\ninteractions, anisotropies and non-Kramers nature of single ion state. While\nsubstituting Zn for Mg changes the chemical pressure, and subtly modifies the\ninteraction energies for compounds with larger RE ions, this substitution\nintroduces structural disorder and modifies the ground states for compounds\nwith smaller RE ions (Ho, Er, Yb).\n", "  The standard procedure for computing scalar multi-loop Feynman integrals\nconsists in reducing them to a basis of so-called master integrals, derive\ndifferential equations in the external invariants satisfied by the latter and,\nfinally, try to solve them as a Laurent series in $\\epsilon = (4-d)/2$, where\n$d$ are the space-time dimensions. The differential equations are, in general,\ncoupled and can be solved using Euler's variation of constants, provided that a\nset of homogeneous solutions is known. Given an arbitrary differential equation\nof order higher than one, there exist no general method for finding its\nhomogeneous solutions. In this paper we show that the maximal cut of the\nintegrals under consideration provides one set of homogeneous solutions,\nsimplifying substantially the solution of the differential equations.\n", "  Being interested in how a strongly coupled system approaches asymptotic\nfreedom, we re-examine existing precision lattice QCD results for thermodynamic\nproperties of the gluon plasma in a large temperature range. We discuss and\nthoroughly test the applicability of perturbative results, on which grounds we\nthen infer that the pressure and other bulk properties approach the free limit\nsomewhat slower than previously thought. We also revise the value of the first\nnon-perturbative coefficient in the weak-coupling expansion.\n", "  Interaction of a binary supermassive black hole with stars in a galactic\nnucleus can result in changes to all the elements of the binary's orbit,\nincluding the angles that define its orientation. If the nucleus is rotating,\nthe orientation changes can be large, causing large changes in the binary's\norbital eccentricity as well. We present a general treatment of this problem\nbased on the Fokker-Planck equation for f, defined as the probability\ndistribution for the binary's orbital elements. First- and second-order\ndiffusion coefficients are derived for the orbital elements of the binary using\nnumerical scattering experiments, and analytic approximations are presented for\nsome of these coefficients. Solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation are then\nderived under various assumptions about the initial rotational state of the\nnucleus and the binary hardening rate. We find that the evolution of the\norbital elements can become qualitatively different when we introduce nuclear\nrotation: 1) the orientation of the binary's orbit evolves toward alignment\nwith the plane of rotation of the nucleus; 2) binary orbital eccentricity\ndecreases for aligned binaries and increases for counter-aligned ones. We find\nthat the diffusive (random-walk) component of a binary's evolution is small in\nnuclei with non-negligible rotation, and we derive the time-evolution equations\nfor the semimajor axis, eccentricity and inclination in that approximation. The\naforementioned effects could influence gravitational wave production as well as\nthe relative orientation of host galaxies and radio jets.\n", "  We consider the critical behaviour of the continuous-time weakly\nself-avoiding walk with contact self-attraction on $\\mathbb{Z}^4$, for\nsufficiently small attraction. We prove that the susceptibility and correlation\nlength of order $p$ (for any $p>0$) have logarithmic corrections to mean field\nscaling, and that the critical two-point function is asymptotic to a multiple\nof $|x|^{-2}$. This shows that small contact self-attraction results in the\nsame critical behaviour as no contact self-attraction; a collapse transition is\npredicted for larger self-attraction. The proof uses a supersymmetric\nrepresentation of the two-point function, and is based on a rigorous\nrenormalisation group method that has been used to prove the same results for\nthe weakly self-avoiding walk, without self-attraction.\n", "  Spin-wave propagation in an assembly of microfabricated 20 nm thick, 2.5\n{\\mu}m wide Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) waveguides is studied using propagating\nspin-wave spectroscopy (PSWS) and phase resolved micro-focused Brillouin Light\nScattering ({\\mu}-BLS) spectroscopy. We show that spin-wave propagation in 50\nparallel waveguides is robust against microfabrication induced imperfections.\nSpin-wave propagation parameters are studied in a wide range of excitation\nfrequencies for the Damon-Eshbach (DE) configuration. As expected from its low\ndamping, YIG allows the propagation of spin waves over long distances (the\nattenuation lengths is 25 {\\mu}m at \\mu$_{0}$H = 45 mT). Direct mapping of spin\nwaves by {\\mu}-BLS allows us to reconstruct the spin-wave dispersion relation\nand to confirm the multi-mode propagation in the waveguides, glimpsed by\npropagating spin-wave spectroscopy.\n", "  As is well known, the ground-state symmetry group of the water dimer switches\nfrom its equilibrium $C_{s}$-character to $C_{2h}$-character as the distance\nbetween the two oxygen atoms of the dimer decreases below $R_{\\rm O-O}\\sim 2.5$\n\\AA{}. For a range of $R_{\\rm O-O}$ between 1 and 5 \\AA{}, and for both\nsymmetries, we apply Partition Density Functional Theory (PDFT) to find the\nunique monomer densities that sum to the correct dimer densities while\nminimizing the sum of the monomer energies. We calculate the work involved in\ndeforming the isolated monomer densities and find that it is slightly larger\nfor the $C_s$ geometry for all $R_{\\rm O-O}$. We discuss how the PDFT densities\nand the corresponding partition potentials support the orbital-interaction\npicture of hydrogen-bond formation.\n", "  In 2013 the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Francois Englert and Peter\nHiggs for their work in 1964 along with the late Robert Brout on the mass\ngeneration mechanism (the Higgs mechanism) in local gauge theories. This\nmechanism requires the existence of a massive scalar particle, the Higgs boson,\nand in 2012 the Higgs boson was finally discovered at the Large Hadron Collider\nafter being sought for almost half a century. In this article we review the\nwork that led to the discovery of the Higgs boson and discuss its implications.\nWe approach the topic from the perspective of a dynamically generated Higgs\nboson that is a fermion-antifermion bound state rather than an elementary field\nthat appears in an input Lagrangian. In particular, we emphasize the connection\nwith the Barden-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. We identify the\ndouble-well Higgs potential not as a fundamental potential but as a mean-field\neffective Lagrangian with a dynamical Higgs boson being generated through a\nresidual interaction that accompanies the mean-field Lagrangian. We discuss\nwhat we believe to be the key challenge raised by the discovery of the Higgs\nboson, namely determining whether it is elementary or composite, and through\nstudy of a conformal invariant field theory model as realized with critical\nscaling and anomalous dimensions, suggest that the width of the Higgs boson\nmight serve as a suitable diagnostic for discriminating between an elementary\nHiggs boson and a composite one. We show that the contribution to the\ncosmological constant due to a composite Higgs boson is more tractable and\nunder control than the contribution due to an elementary Higgs boson, and is\npotentially completely under control if there is an underlying conformal\nsymmetry not just in a critical scaling matter sector, but equally in the\ngravity sector to which the matter sector couples.\n", "  Based on the cross correlation analysis of the Kikuchi diffraction patterns\nhigh-resolution EBSD is a well established method to determine the internal\nstress in deformed crystalline materials. In many cases, however, the stress\nvalues obtained at the different scanning points have a large (in the order of\nGPa) scatter. As it was first demonstrated by Wilkinson and co-workers this is\ndue to the long tail of the probability distribution of the internal stress\n($P(\\sigma)$) generated by the dislocations present in the system. According to\nthe theoretical investigations of Groma and co-workers the tail of $P(\\sigma)$\nis inverse cubic with prefactor proportional to the total dislocation density\n$<\\rho>$. In this paper we present a direct comparison of the X-ray line\nbroadening and $P(\\sigma)$ obtained by EBSD on deformed Cu single crystals. It\nis shown that $<\\rho>$ can be determined from $P(\\sigma)$. This opens new\nperspectives for the application of EBSD in determining mesoscale parameters in\na heterogeneous sample.\n", "  The relative energies of the low-pressure rutile, anatase, and brookite\npolymorphs and the high-pressure columbite polymorph of TiO$_2$ have been\ncalculated as a function of temperature using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo\n(DMC) method and density functional theory (DFT). The vibrational energies are\nfound to be important on the scale of interest and significant quartic\nanharmonicity is found in the rutile phase. Static-lattice DFT calculations\npredict that anatase is lower in energy than rutile, in disagreement with\nexperiment. The accurate description of electronic correlations afforded by DMC\ncalculations and the inclusion of anharmonic vibrational effects contribute to\nstabilizing rutile with respect to anatase. Our calculations predict a phase\ntransition from anatase to rutile TiO$_2$ at $630 \\pm 210$ K.\n", "  We study the scalar products between Bethe states in the XXZ spin chain with\nanisotropy $|\\Delta|>1$ in the semi-classical limit where the length of the\nspin chain and the number of magnons tend to infinity with their ratio kept\nfinite and fixed. Our method is a natural yet non-trivial generalization of\nsimilar methods developed for the XXX spin chain. The final result can be\nwritten in a compact form as a contour integral in terms of Faddeev's quantum\ndilogarithm function, which in the isotropic limit reduces to the classical\ndilogarithm function.\n", "  A novel prediction is derived by the Two-State-Vector-Formalism (TSVF) for a\nparticle superposed over three boxes. Under appropriate pre- and\npostselections, and with tunneling enabled between two of the boxes, it is\npossible to derive not only one, but three predictions for three different\ntimes within the intermediate interval. These predictions are moreover\ncontradictory. The particle (when looked for using a projective measurement)\nseems to disappear from the first box where it would have been previously found\nwith certainty, appearing instead within the third box, to which no tunneling\nis possible, and later re-appearing within the second. It turns out that local\nmeasurement (i.e. opening one of the boxes) fails to indicate the particle's\npresence, but subtler measurements performed on the two boxes together reveal\nthe particle's nonlocal modular momentum spatially separated from its mass.\nAnother advance of this setting is that, unlike other predictions of the TSVF\nthat rely on weak and/or counterfactual measurements, the present one uses\nactual projective measurements. This outcome is then corroborated by adding\nweak measurements and the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results strengthen the\nrecently suggested time-symmetric Heisenberg ontology based on nonlocal\ndeterministic operators. They can be also tested using the newly developed\nquantum router.\n", "  Landau levels and shallow donor states in multiple GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells\n(MQWs) are investigated by means of the cyclotron resonance at mega-gauss\nmagnetic fields. Measurements of magneto-optical transitions were performed in\npulsed fields up to 140 T and temperatures from 6 to 300 K. The $14\\times14$\n\\textbf{P}$\\cdot$\\textbf{p} band model for GaAs is used to interpret\nfree-electron transitions in a magnetic field. Temperature behavior of the\nobserved resonant structure indicates, in addition to the free-electron Landau\nstates, contributions of magneto-donor states in the GaAs wells and possibly in\nthe AlGaAs barriers. The magneto-donor energies are calculated using a\nvariational procedure suitable for high magnetic fields and accounting for\nconduction band nonparabolicity in GaAs. It is shown that the above states,\nincluding their spin splitting, allow one to interpret the observed\nmagneto-optical transitions in MQWs in the middle infrared region. Our\nexperimental and theoretical results at very high magnetic fields are\nconsistent with the picture used previously for GaAs/AlGaAs MQWs at lower\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  We study the zero textures of the Yukawa matrices in the minimal extended\ntype-I seesaw (MES) model which can give rise to $\\sim$ eV scale sterile\nneutrinos. In this model, three right handed neutrinos and one extra singlet\n$S$ are added to generate a light sterile neutrino. The light neutrino mass\nmatrix for the active neutrinos, $ m_{\\nu}$, depends on the Dirac neutrino mass\nmatrix ($ M_{D} $), Majorana neutrino mass matrix ($ M_{R} $) and the mass\nmatrix ($ M_{S} $) coupling the right handed neutrinos and the singlet. The\nmodel predicts one of the light neutrino masses to vanish. We systematically\ninvestigate the zero textures in $ M_{D} $ and observe that maximum five zeros\nin $ M_{D} $ can lead to viable zero textures in $ m_{\\nu} $. For this study we\nconsider four different forms for $ M_R $ (one diagonal and three off diagonal)\nand two different forms of $(M_{S})$ containing one zero. Remarkably we obtain\nonly two allowed forms of $ m_{\\nu} $ ($m_{e\\tau} = 0 $ and $m_{\\tau\\tau}=0$)\nhaving inverted hierarchical mass spectrum. We re-analyze the phenomenological\nimplications of these two allowed textures of $m_\\nu$ in the light of recent\nneutrino oscillation data. In the context of the MES model, we also express the\nlow energy mass matrix, the mass of the sterile neutrino and the active-sterile\nmixing in terms of the parameters of the allowed Yukawa matrices. The MES model\nleads to some extra correlations which disallow some of the Yukawa textures\nobtained earlier, even though they give allowed one-zero forms of $m_\\nu$. We\nshow that the allowed textures in our study can be realized in a simple way in\na model based on MES mechanism with a discrete Abelian flavor symmetry group\n$Z_8 \\times Z_2$.\n", "  The effects of oxygen flow speed and pressure on the iron and mild steel\ncombustion are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The studied\nspecimens are vertical cylindrical rods subjected to an axial oxygen flow and\nignited at the upper end by laser irradiation. Three main stages of the\ncombustion process have been identified experimentally: (1) Induction period,\nduring which the rod is heated until an intensive metal oxidation begins at its\nupper end; (2) Static combustion, during which a laminar liquid \"cap\" slowly\ngrows on the upper rod end; and, after the liquid cap detachment from the\nsample, (3) Dynamic combustion, which is characterized by a rapid metal\nconsumption and turbulent liquid motions. An analytical description of these\nstages is given. In particular, a model of the dynamic combustion is\nconstructed based on the turbulent oxygen transport through the liquid\nmetal-oxide flow. This model yields a simple expression for the fraction of\nmetal burned in the process, and allows one to calculate the normal propagation\nspeed of the solid metal--liquid interface as a function of the oxygen flow\nspeed and pressure. A comparison of the theory with the experimental results is\nmade.\n", "  p-3H and n-3He scattering in the energy range above the n-3He but below the\nd-d thresholds is studied by solving the 4-nucleon problem with a realistic\nnucleon-nucleon interaction. Three different methods -- Alt, Grassberger and\nSandhas, Hyperspherical Harmonics, and Faddeev-Yakubovsky -- have been employed\nand their results for both elastic and charge-exchange processes are compared.\nWe observe a good agreement between the three different methods, thus the\nobtained results may serve as a benchmark. A comparison with the available\nexperimental data is also reported and discussed.\n", "  Recently, a homogeneous ansatz has been used to study cold dense nuclear\nmatter in the Sakai-Sugimoto model of holographic QCD. To justify this\nhomogeneous approximation we here investigate a homogeneous ansatz within a\nlow-dimensional toy version of Sakai-Sugimoto to study finite baryon density\nconfigurations and compare it to full numerical solutions. We find the ansatz\ncorresponds to enforcing a dyon salt arrangement in which the soliton solutions\nare split into half-soliton layers. Within this ansatz we find analogues of the\nproposed baryonic popcorn transitions, in which solutions split into multiple\nlayers in the holographic direction. The homogeneous results are found to\nqualitatively match the full numerical solutions, lending confidence to the\nhomogeneous approximations of the full Sakai-Sugimoto model. In addition, we\nfind exact compact solutions in the high density, flat space limit which\ndemonstrate the existence of further popcorn transitions to three layers and\nbeyond.\n", "  We investigate the equilibrium properties of a single area-minimising bubble\ntrapped between two narrowly-separated parallel curved plates. We begin with\nthe simple case of a a bubble trapped between concentric spherical plates. We\ndevelop a model that shows that the surface tension energy of the bubble is\nlower when confined between spherical plates as compared to a bubble trapped\nbetween flat plates. We confirm our findings by comparing against Surface\nEvolver simulations. Next, we derive a simple model for a bubble between\narbitrarily curved parallel plates. The energy is found to be higher when the\nlocal Gaussian curvature of the plates is negative and lower when the curvature\nis positive. To check the validity of the the model we consider a bubble\ntrapped between concentric tori. In the toroidal case we find that the\nsensitivity of the bubble's energy to the local curvature acts as a geometric\npotential capable of driving bubbles from regions with negative to positive\ncurvature.\n", "  In a recent article [R. R. Alfano and D. A. Nolan, Opt. Commun. 361 (2016)\n25] the group velocity reduction below the speed of light in the case of\ncertain Bessel beam pulses has been considered and an idea of its application\nfor a natural optical buffer presented. However, the authors treat the problem\nas if only one type of Bessel pulse existed, no matter how it is generated. The\ndeficiencies of the article stem from not being familiar with an extensive\nliterature on Bessel pulses, in particular, with a couple of papers published\nmuch earlier in the J. Opt. Soc. Am. A, which have studied exactly the same\nproblem more thoroughly.\n", "  Integration with conventional electronics offers a straightforward and\neconomical approach to upgrading existing superconducting technologies, such as\nscaling up superconducting detectors into large arrays and combining single\nflux quantum (SFQ) digital circuits with semiconductor logic and memories.\nHowever, direct output signals from superconducting devices (e.g., Josephson\njunctions) are usually not compatible with the input requirements of\nconventional devices (e.g., transistors). Here, we demonstrate the use of a\nsingle three-terminal superconducting-nanowire device, called the nanocryotron\n(nTron), as a digital comparator to combine SFQ circuits with mature\nsemiconductor circuits such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)\ncircuits. Since SFQ circuits can digitize output signals from general\nsuperconducting devices and CMOS circuits can interface existing\nCMOS-compatible electronics, our results demonstrate the feasibility of a\ngeneral architecture that uses an nTron as an interface to realize a\nsuper-hybrid system consisting of superconducting detectors, superconducting\nquantum electronics, CMOS logic and memories, and other conventional\nelectronics.\n", "  We extend the relativistic mean-field models with hadron masses and\nmeson-baryon coupling constants dependent on the scalar $\\sigma$ field, studied\npreviously to incorporate $\\Delta(1232)$ baryons. Available empirical\ninformation is analyzed to put constraints on the couplings of $\\Delta$s with\nmeson fields. Conditions for the appearance of $\\Delta$s are studied. We\ndemonstrate that with inclusion of the $\\Delta$s our equations of state\ncontinue to fulfill majority of known empirical constraints including the\npressure-density constraint from heavy-ion collisions, the constraint on the\nmaximum mass of the neutron stars, the direct Urca and the gravitational-baryon\nmass ratio constraints.\n", "  The angular dependence of the cumulative particles production off nuclei near\nthe kinematical boundary for multistep process is defined by characteristic\npolynomials in angular variables $J_N^2(z_N^\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the\npolar angle defining the momentum of the final (cumulative) particle,\n$z_N^\\theta = cos (\\theta/N)$, the integer $N$ being the multiplicity of the\nprocess (the number of interactions). Physical argumentation, exploring the\nsmall phase space method, leads to the appearance of equations for these\npolynomials $J_N^2[cos(\\pi/N)]=0$. The recurrent relations between polynomials\nwith different $N$ are obtained, and their connection with known in mathematics\nChebyshev polynomials of 2-d kind is established. As a result of this equality,\ndifferential cross section of the cumulative particle production has\ncharacteristic behaviour $d\\sigma \\sim 1/ \\sqrt {\\pi - \\theta}$ at $\\theta \\sim\n\\pi$ (the backward focusing effect). Such behaviour takes place for any\nmultiplicity of the interaction, beginning with $n=3$, elastic or inelastic\n(with resonances excitations in intermediate states), and can be called the\nnuclear glory phenomenon, or 'Buddha's light' of cumulative particles.\n", "  We attain the previously unaccessed full superconducting dome in a pristine\nhigh temperature cuprate superconductor by applying pressures up to 280 kbar to\nsamples of near stoichiometric YBa2Cu3O7. The obtained superconducting phase\nboundary as a function of hole doping closely follows the superconducting dome\nin La2-xSrxCuO4. Measurements are now enabled to trace the evolution of various\nentangled phases and the Fermi surface from the underdoped to overdoped regime\nin a single high purity cuprate superconducting family of materials.\n", "  Decoupling of total electronic and nuclear spin moments of Cs atoms in\nexternal magnetic field for the case of atomic $D_1$ line, leading to onset of\nthe hyperfine Paschen-Back regime has been studied theoretically and\nexperimentally. Selective reflection of laser radiation from an interface of\ndielectric window and atomic vapor confined in a nanocell with 300 nm gap\nthickness was implemented for the experimental studies. The real time\nderivative of selective reflection signal with a frequency position coinciding\nwith atomic transitions was used in measurements, providing $\\sim$ 40 MHz\nspectral resolution and linearity of signal response in respect to transition\nprobability. Behavior of 28 individual Zeeman transitions in a wide range of\nlongitudinal magnetic field (0 - 6 kG) has been tracked under excitation of Cs\nvapor by a low-intensity $\\sigma^+$- polarized cw laser radiation. For $B\\ge\n6~$kG, only 8 transitions with nearly equal probabilities and the same\nfrequency slope remained in the spectrum, which is a manifestation of the\nhyperfine Paschen-Back regime. The obtained experimental results are consistent\nwith numerical modeling. Due to small divergence of selective reflection\nsignal, as well as sub-wavelength thickness and sub-Doppler spectral linewidth\ninherent to nanocell, the employed technique can be used for distant remote\nsensing of magnetic field with high spatial and $B$-field resolution.\n", "  This paper contains a rigorous mathematical example of direct derivation of\nthe system of Euler hydrodynamic equations from Hamiltonian equations for N\npoint particle system as N tends to infinity. Direct means that the following\nstandard tools are not used in the proof: stochastic dynamics, thermodynamics,\nBoltzmann kinetic equations, correlation functions approach by N. N.\nBogolyubov.\n", "  This review describes the development of the physics of hadronic cross\nsections up to recent LHC results and cosmic ray experiments. We present here a\ncomprehensive review - written with a historical perspective - about total\ncross-sections from medium to the highest energies explored experimentally and\nstudied through a variety of methods and theoretical models for over sixty\nyears. We begin by recalling the analytic properties of the elastic amplitude\nand the theorems about the asymptotic behavior of the total cross-section. A\ndiscussion of how proton-proton cross-sections are extracted from cosmic rays\nat higher than accelerator energies and help the study of these asymptotic\nlimits, is presented. This is followed by a description of the advent of\nparticle colliders, through which high energies and unmatched experimental\nprecisions have been attained. Thus the measured hadronic elastic and total\ncross-sections have become crucial instruments to probe the so called soft part\nof QCD physics, where quarks and gluons are confined, and have led to test and\nrefine Regge behavior and a number of diffractive models. As the c.m. energy\nincreases, the total cross-section also probes the transition into hard\nscattering describable with perturbative QCD, the so-called mini-jet region.\nFurther tests are provided by cross-section measurements of gamma p, gamma*p\nand gamma* gamma* for models based on vector meson dominance, scaling limits of\nvirtual photons at high Q^2 and the BFKL formalism. Models interpolating from\nvirtual to real photons are also tested.\n", "  We present an effective method for simulating wall-bounded multiphase flows\nconsisting of $N$ ($N\\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids with\ndifferent densities, viscosities and pairwise surface tensions. The N-phase\nphysical formulation is based on a modified thermodynamically consistent phase\nfield model that is more general than in a previous work, and it is developed\nby considering the reduction consistency if some of the fluid components were\nabsent from the system. We propose an N-phase contact-angle boundary condition\nthat is reduction consistent between $N$ phases and $M$ phases ($2\\leqslant\nM\\leqslant N-1$). We also present a numerical algorithm for solving the N-phase\ngoverning equations together with the contact-angle boundary conditions\ndeveloped herein. Extensive numerical experiments are presented for several\nflow problems involving multiple fluid components and solid-wall boundaries to\ninvestigate the wettability effects with multiple types of contact angles. In\nparticular, we compare simulation results with the de Gennes theory for the\ncontact-angle effects on the liquid drop spreading on wall surfaces, and\ndemonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results.\n", "  We consider the relative entropy between vacuum states of two different\ntheories: a conformal field theory (CFT), and the CFT perturbed by a relevant\noperator. By restricting both states to the null Cauchy surface in the causal\ndomain of a sphere, we make the relative entropy equal to the difference of\nentanglement entropies. As a result, this difference has the positivity and\nmonotonicity properties of relative entropy. From this it follows a simple\nalternative proof of the c-theorem in d=2 space-time dimensions and, for d>2,\nthe proof that the coefficient of the area term in the entanglement entropy\ndecreases along the renormalization group (RG) flow between fixed points. We\ncomment on the regimes of convergence of relative entropy, depending on the\nspace-time dimensions and the conformal dimension $\\Delta$ of the perturbation\nthat triggers the RG flow.\n", "  Novel photonic structures such as multi-core fibers and graphene based arrays\npresent unique opportunities to manipulate and control the propagation of\nlight. Here we discuss nonlinear dynamics for structures with a few (2 to 6)\nelements for which linear and nonlinear properties can be tuned. Specifically\nwe show how nonlinearity, coupling, and parity-time PT symmetric gain/loss\nrelate to existence, stability and in general, dynamical properties of\nnonlinear optical modes. The main emphasis of our presentation will be on\nsystems with few degrees of freedom, most notably couplers, trimers and\ngeneralizations thereof to systems with 6 nodes.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of photon echo exhibited by exciton-plasmon\nsystems under strong coupling conditions. Using a self-consistent model based\non coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations we investigate femtosecond time dynamics of\nensembles of interacting molecules optically coupled to surface plasmon\nsupporting materials. It is shown that observed photon echoes under two pulse\npump-probe sequence are highly dependent on various material parameters such as\nmolecular concentration and periodicity. Simulations of photon echoes in\nexciton-plasmon materials reveal a unique signature of the strong\nexciton-plasmon coupling, namely a double-peak structure in spectra of recorded\necho signals. This phenomenon is shown to be related to hybrid states (upper\nand lower polaritons) in exciton-plasmon systems under strong coupling\nconditions. It is also demonstrated that the double-peak echo is highly\nsensitive to mild deviations of the coupling from resonant conditions making it\na great tool for ultrafast probes.\n", "  Peripheral collisions of heavy ions can give rise to extremely intense\nmagnetic fields. It has been suggested that these fields might invalidate the\nholographic description of the corresponding quark-gluon plasmas, assuming that\nthese can be modelled by strongly coupled field theories. In the case of the\nplasmas produced in collisions at the RHIC facility (including in the beam\nenergy scans), it is known how to deal with this problem: one has to take into\naccount the large angular momenta generated in these plasmas, and the effects\nof the baryonic chemical potential. But this does not work for the plasmas\nproduced in peripheral collisions at the LHC. However, these results neglect\nsome (less significant) aspects of bulk physics; could it be that the problem\nis resolved by taking into account these lower-order effects? Here we use a\nbulk dilatonic field (fully compatible with boundary data, as well as with the\nasymptotically AdS character of the bulk geometry) as a model of these effects,\nand show that this is unlikely to be the solution. Thus, the existence of a\nconsistent holographic description of the most extreme LHC plasmas remains open\nto question.\n", "  The magnetostatic energy is calculated for a magnetic vortex in a noncircular\nelliptical nanodisk. It is well-known that the energy of a vortex in the\ncircular disk is minimized though an ansatz that eliminates the magnetostatic\ncharge at the disk edge. Beginning with this ansatz for the circular disk, a\nconformal mapping of a circle interior onto the interior of an ellipse results\nin the magnetization of the elliptical disk. This magnetization in the interior\nof an ellipse also has no magnetostatic charge at the disk edge also minimizing\nthe magnetostatic energy. As expected the energy has a quadratic dependence on\nthe displacement of the vortex core from the ellipse center, but reflecting the\nlower symmetry of the ellipse. Through numerical integration of the\nmagnetostatic integral a general expression for the energy is obtained for\nellipticity values from 1.0 to about 0.3. Finally a general expression for the\ngyrotropic frequency as described by the Thiele equation is obtained.\n", "  Recent results from the LHC's first run have revealed intriguing departures\nfrom lepton flavour universality in the semi-leptonic decays of $B$-mesons. We\ndiscuss the complementary role that rare kaon decays can provide in testing new\nphysics explanations of these flavour anomalies. In the framework of minimal\nflavour violation, we relate the chiral low-energy constants involved in\n$K\\to\\pi\\ell\\ell'$ and $K\\to\\ell\\ell'$ ($\\ell = \\mu \\mbox{ or } e$) with the\nnew physics Wilson coefficients of the $b\\to s$ effective Hamiltonian. We\ncomment on the determination of these low-energy constants at NA62 and future\nkaon experiments, as well as the required improvements in sensitivity necessary\nto test the $B$-physics anomalies in the kaon sector.\n", "  Light cone perturbation theory has become an essential tool to calculate\ncross sections for various small-$x$ dilute-dense processes such as deep\ninelastic scattering and forward proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions.\nHere we set out to do one loop calculations in an explicit helicity basis in\nthe four dimensional helicity scheme. As a first process we calculate light\ncone wave function for one gluon emission to one-loop order in Hamiltonian\nperturbation theory on the light front. We regulate ultraviolet divergences\nwith transverse dimensional regularization and soft divergences with using a\ncut-off on longitudinal momentum. We show that when all the renormalization\nconstants are combined, the ultraviolet divergences can be absorbed into the\nstandard QCD running coupling constant, and give an explicit expression for the\nremaining finite part.\n", "  The parameters of the nuclear energy density have to be adjusted to\nexperimental data. As a result they carry certain uncertainty which then\npropagates to calculated values of observables. In the present work we quantify\nthe statistical uncertainties of binding energies, proton quadrupole moments,\nand proton matter radius for three UNEDF Skyrme energy density functionals by\ntaking advantage of the knowledge of the model parameter uncertainties. We find\nthat the uncertainty of UNEDF models increases rapidly when going towards\nproton or neutron rich nuclei. We also investigate the impact of each model\nparameter on the total error budget.\n", "  We present a multiscale approach for identifying features in ocean beds by\nsolving inverse problems in high frequency seafloor acoustics. The setting is\nbased on Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR) imaging used in scientific,\ncommercial, and military applications. The forward model incorporates\nmultiscale simulations, by coupling Helmholtz equations and geometrical optics\nfor a wide range of spatial scales in the seafloor geometry. This allows for\ndetailed recovery of seafloor parameters including material type. Simulated\nbackscattered data is generated using numerical microlocal analysis techniques.\nIn order to lower the computational cost of the large-scale simulations in the\ninversion process, we take advantage of a pre-computed library of\nrepresentative acoustic responses from various seafloor parameterizations.\n", "  We present slow-light photonic crystal waveguide designs that provide a\n$\\times$8.6 improvement of the local density of optical states at a fully\nchiral point over previous designs.\n", "  We show the realization of axion electrodynamics within the Dual Chiral\nDensity Wave phase of dense quark matter in the presence of a magnetic field.\nThe system exhibits an anomalous dissipantionless Hall current perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field and an anomalous electric charge density. Connection to\ntopological insulators and 3D optical lattices, as well as possible\nimplications for heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars are outlined.\n", "  The orthorhombically distorted perovskite NaMnF$_{3}$ has been predicted to\nbecome ferroelectric if an $a=c$ distortion of the bulk $Pnma$ structure is\nimposed. In order to test this prediction, NaMnF$_{3}$ thin films were grown on\nSrTiO$_{3}$ (001) single crystal substrates via molecular beam epitaxy. The\nbest films were smooth and single phase with four different twin domains.\nIn-plane magnetization measurements revealed the presence of antiferromagnetic\nordering with weak ferromagnetism below the N\\'eel temperature $T_N=66$ K. For\nthe dielectric studies, NaMnF$_{3}$ films were grown on a 30 nm SrRuO$_{3}$\n(001) layer used as a bottom electrode grown via pulsed laser deposition. The\ncomplex permittivity as a function of frequency indicated a strong Debye-like\nrelaxation contribution characterized by a distribution of relaxation times. A\npower-law divergence of the characteristic relaxation time revealed an\norder-disorder phase transition at 8 K. The slow relaxation dynamics indicated\nthe formation of super-dipoles (superparaelectric moments) that extend over\nseveral unit cells, similar to polar nanoregions of relaxor ferroelectrics.\n", "  Drive particle beams in linear or weakly nonlinear regimes of the plasma\nwakefield accelerator quickly reach a radial equilibrium with the wakefield,\nwhich is described in detail for the first time. The equilibrium beam state and\nself-consistent wakefields are obtained by combining analytical relationships,\nnumerical integration, and first-principle simulations. In the equilibrium\nstate, the beam density is strongly peaked near the axis, the beam radius is\nconstant along the beam, and longitudinal variation of the focusing strength is\nbalanced by varying beam emittance. The transverse momentum distribution of\nbeam particles depends on the observation radius and is neither separable, nor\nGaussian.\n", "  We demonstrate how a large spin system ($S=7/2$) with the ground and the\nfirst excited state separated by a seven photon transition exhibit non\nequilibrium thermodynamic properties and how the population distribution may be\nmanipulated using coupling between energy levels. The first method involves\nnon-adiabatic passage through an avoided level crossing controlled with an\nexternal DC magnetic field and the resulting Landau Zener transition. The\nsecond method is based on external cavity pumping to a higher energy state\nhybridised with another state that is two single photon transitions away from\nthe ground state. The results are confirmed experimentally with Gd$^{3+}$\nimpurity ion ensemble in a YVO$_{4}$ crystal cooled to 20 mK, which also acts\nas a microwave photonic whispering gallery mode resonator. Extremely long life\ntimes are observed due to large number of photons required for the transition\nbetween the ground and the first excited states.\n", "  We discuss the validity of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM EFT)\nas the low-energy effective theory for the two-Higgs-doublet Model (2HDM).\nUsing the up-to-date Higgs signal strength measurements at the LHC, one can\nobtain a likelihood function for the Wilson coefficients of dimension-6\noperators in the EFT Lagrangian. Given the matching between the 2HDM and the\nEFT, the constraints on the Wilson coefficients can be translated into\nconstraints on the parameters of the 2HDM Lagrangian. We discuss under which\nconditions such a procedure correctly reproduces the true limits on the 2HDM.\nFinally, we employ the SM EFT to identify the pattern of the Higgs boson\ncouplings that are needed to improve the fit to the current Higgs data. To this\nend, one needs, simultaneously, to increase the top Yukawa coupling, decrease\nthe bottom Yukawa coupling, and induce a new contact interaction of the Higgs\nboson with gluons. We comment on how these modifications can be realized in the\n2HDM extended by new colored particles.\n", "  The era of gravitational-wave astronomy has started with the discovery of the\nbinary black hole coalescences (BBH) GW150914 and GW151226 by the LIGO\ninstruments. These systems allowed for the first direct measurement of masses\nand spins of black holes. The component masses in each of the systems have been\nestimated with uncertainties of over 10\\%, with only weak constraints on the\nspin magnitude and orientation. In this paper we show how these uncertainties\nwill be typical for this type of source when using advanced detectors. Focusing\nin particular on heavy BBH of masses similar to GW150914, we find that typical\nuncertainties in the estimation of the source-frame component masses will be\naround 40\\%. We also find that for most events the magnitude of the component\nspins will be estimated poorly: for only 10\\% of the systems the uncertainties\nin the spin magnitude of the primary (secondary) BH will be below 0.7 (0.8).\nConversely, the effective spin along the angular momentum can be estimated more\nprecisely than either spins, with uncertainties below 0.16 for 10\\% of the\nsystems. We also quantify how often large or negligible primary spins can be\nexcluded, and how often the sign of the effective spin can be measured. We show\nhow the angle between the spin and the orbital angular momentum can only seldom\nbe measured with uncertainties below 60$^\\circ$. We then investigate how the\nmeasurement of spin parameters depends on the inclination angle and the total\nmass of the source. We find that when precession is present, uncertainties are\nsmaller for systems observed close to edge-on. Contrarily to what happens for\nlow-mass, inspiral dominated, sources, for heavy BBH we find that large spins\naligned with the orbital angular momentum can be measured with small\nuncertainty. We also show how spin uncertainties increase with the total mass.\nFinally...\n", "  If an excess potentially heralding new physics is noticed in collider data,\nit would be useful to be able to compare the data with entire classes of models\nat once. This talk discusses a method that applies when the new physics\ncorresponds to the production and decay of a single, relatively narrow,\ns-channel resonance. A simplifed model of the resonance allows us to convert an\nestimated signal cross section into model-independent bounds on the product of\nthe branching ratios corresponding to production and decay. This quickly\nreveals whether a given class of models could possibly produce a signal of the\nobserved size. We will describe how to apply our analysis framework to cases of\ncurrent experimental interest, including resonances decaying to dibosons,\ndiphotons, dileptons, or dijets.\n", "  Dispersive waves in two-dimensional blocky materials with periodic\nmicrostructure made up of equal rigid units having polygonal centro-symmetric\nshape with mass and gyroscopic inertia, connected each other through\nhomogeneous linear interfaces, have been analysed. The acoustic behavior of the\nresulting discrete Lagrangian model has been obtained through a Floquet-Bloch\napproach. From the resulting eigenproblem derived by the Euler-Lagrange\nequations for harmonic wave propagation, two acoustic branches and an optical\nbranch are obtained in the frequency spectrum. A micropolar continuum model to\napproximate the Lagrangian model has been derived based on a second-order\nTaylor expansion of the generalized macro-displacement field. The constitutive\nequations of the equivalent micropolar continuum have been obtained, with the\npeculiarity that the positive definiteness of the second-order symmetric tensor\nassociated to the curvature vector is not guaranteed and depends both on the\nratio between the local tangent and normal stiffness and on the block shape.\nThe same results has been obtained through an extended Hamiltonian derivation\nof the equations of motion for the equivalent continuum that is related to the\nHill-Mandel macro homogeneity condition. Moreover, it is shown that the\nhermitian matrix governing the eigenproblem of harmonic wave propagation in the\nmicropolar model is exact up to the second order in the norm of the wave vector\nwith respect to the same matrix from the discrete model. To appreciate the\nacoustic behavior of some relevant blocky materials and to understand the\nreliability and the validity limits of the micropolar continuum model, some\nblocky patterns have been analysed: rhombic and hexagonal assemblages and\nrunning bond masonry.\n", "  Based on the color-dipole picture, we present a successful parameter-free\nprediction for the recent high-energy $J/\\psi$ photoproduction data from the\nLarge Hadron Collider. The experimental data provide empirical evidence for the\ntransition from color transparency to saturation.\n", "  Molecular systems can exhibit a complex, chemically tailorable inner\nstructure which allows for targeting of specific mechanical, electronic and\noptical properties. At the single-molecule level, two major complementary ways\nto explore these properties are molecular quantum-dot structures and scanning\nprobes. This article outlines comprehensive principles of electron-transport\nspectroscopy relevant to both these approaches and presents a new,\nhigh-resolution experiment on a high-spin single-molecule junction exemplifying\nthese principles. Such spectroscopy plays a key role in further advancing our\nunderstanding of molecular and atomic systems, in particular the relaxation of\ntheir spin. In this joint experimental and theoretical analysis, particular\nfocus is put on the crossover between resonant regime [single-electron\ntunneling (SET)] and the off-resonant regime [inelastic electron (co)tunneling\n(IETS)]. We show that the interplay of these two processes leads to unexpected\nmirages of resonances not captured by either of the two pictures alone.\nAlthough this turns out to be important in a large fraction of the possible\nregimes of level positions and bias voltages, it has been given little\nattention in molecular transport studies. Combined with nonequilibrium IETS --\nfour-electron pump-probe excitations -- these mirages provide crucial\ninformation on the relaxation of spin excitations. Our encompassing physical\npicture is supported by a master-equation approach that goes beyond weak\ncoupling. The present work encourages the development of a broader connection\nbetween the fields of molecular quantum-dot and scanning probe spectroscopy.\n", "  We study the parametric interaction between a single Nitrogen-Vacancy\nelectronic spin and a diamond mechanical resonator in which the spin is\nembedded. Coupling between spin and oscillator is achieved by crystal strain,\nwhich is generated upon actuation of the oscillator and which parametrically\nmodulates the spins' energy splitting. Under coherent microwave driving of the\nspin, this parametric drive leads to a locking of the spin Rabi frequency to\nthe oscillator mode in the megahertz range. Both the Rabi oscillation decay\ntime and the inhomogeneous spin dephasing time increase by two orders of\nmagnitude under this spin-locking condition. We present routes to prolong the\ndephasing times even further, potentially to the relaxation time limit. The\nremarkable coherence protection that our hybrid spin-oscillator system offers\nis reminiscent of recently proposed concatenated continuous dynamical\ndecoupling schemes and results from our robust, drift-free strain-coupling\nmechanism and the narrow linewidth of the high-quality diamond mechanical\noscillator employed. Our findings suggest feasible applications in quantum\ninformation processing and sensing.\n", "  We report the coupling of an external $\\gamma\\gamma$ or $t\\bar t$ state to a\nstrongly interacting EWSBS satisfying unitarity. We exploit perturbation theory\nfor those coupling of the external state, whereas the EWSBS is taken as\nstrongly interacting. We use a modified version of the IAM unitarization\nprocedure to model such a strongly interacting regime. The matrix elements\n$V_LV_L\\to V_LV_L$, $V_LV_L\\leftrightarrow hh$, $hh\\to hh$,\n$V_LV_L\\leftrightarrow\\{\\gamma\\gamma,t\\bar t\\}$, and\n$hh\\leftrightarrow\\{\\gamma\\gamma,t\\bar t\\}$ are all computed to NLO in\nperturbation theory with the Nonlinear Effective Field Theory of the EWSBS,\nwithin the Equivalence Theorem. This allows us to describe resonances of the\nelectroweak sector that may be found at the LHC and their effect on other\nchannels such as $\\gamma\\gamma$ or $t\\bar t$ where they may be discovered.\n", "  Stimulated Brillouin scattering was recently observed in nanoscale silicon\nwaveguides. Surprisingly, thermally-driven photon-phonon conversion in these\nstructures had not yet been reported. Here, we inject an optical probe in a\nsuspended silicon waveguide and measure its phase fluctuations at the output.\nWe observe mechanical resonances around 8 GHz with a scattering efficiency of\n$10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}^{-1}$ and a signal-to-noise ratio of 2. The observations\nare in agreement with a theory of noise in these waveguides as well as with\nstimulated measurements. Our scheme may simplify measurements of mechanical\nsignatures in nanoscale waveguides and is a step towards a better grasp of\nthermal noise in these new continuum optomechanical systems.\n", "  A selection of unfolding methods commonly used in High Energy Physics is\ncompared. The methods discussed here are: bin-by-bin correction factors, matrix\ninversion, template fit, Tikhonov regularisation and two examples of iterative\nmethods. Two procedures to choose the strength of the regularisation are\ntested, namely the L-curve scan and a scan of global correlation coefficients.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the unfolding methods and choices of the\nregularisation strength are discussed using a toy example.\n", "  We show that in the scenario where dark matter (DM) particles annihilate\nthrough light mediators, the energy spectra of the final state cosmic-ray\nparticles depend strongly on the mediator mass. For final state antiprotons, a\nspectrum with relatively narrow peak occurs when the mediator mass is\ncomparable to the $\\pbar p$ production threshold. Of interest, the latest\nAMS-02 data on the $\\pbar/p$ flux ratio hint at a bump-like excess over the\nexpected background in the energy range $\\sim100-450$ GeV. We show that such a\nlight mediator scenario is favoured by the latest AMS-02 data over the\nscenarios of DM direct annihilation into the standard model particles and that\nof antiprotons produced from inside supernova remnants (SNRs), and is\nconsistent with the upper limits derived from the Fermi-LAT data on the gamma\nrays towards the dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The $\\pbar/p$ flux ratio with\nenergy above 450 GeV is predicted to fall with energy quickly, which can be\neasily distinguished from the other two scenarios as they predict the ratio to\nbe flattening or rising up to multi-TeV region.\n", "  In this work we analyse positive- and negative-parity channels for the\nnucleon (spin $1/2$ octet), $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega$ baryons (spin $3/2$ decuplet)\nusing lattice QCD. In Nature, at zero temperature, chiral symmetry is\nspontaneously broken, causing positive- and negative-parity ground states to\nhave different masses. However, chiral symmetry is expected to be restored (for\nmassless quarks) around the crossover temperature, implying that the two\nopposite parity channels should become degenerate. Here we study what happens\nin a temperature range which includes both the hadronic and the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP) phase. By analysing the correlation and spectral functions via\nexponential fits and the Maximum Entropy Method respectively, we have found\nparity doubling for the nucleon and $\\Delta$ baryon channels in the QGP phase.\nFor the $\\Omega$ baryon we see a clear signal of parity doubling at the\ncrossover temperature, which is however not complete, due to the nonzero\nstrange quark mass. Moreover, in-medium effects in the hadronic phase are\nevident for all three baryons, in particular for the negative-parity ground\nstates. This might have implications for the hadron resonance gas model. In\nthis work we used the FASTSUM anisotropic $N_f = 2 + 1$ ensembles.\n", "  We demonstrate that with two small modifications, the popular dielectric\ncontinuum model is capable of predicting, with high accuracy, ion solvation\nthermodynamics in numerous polar solvents, and ion solvation free energies in\nwater--co-solvent mixtures. The first modification involves perturbing the\nmacroscopic dielectric-flux interface condition at the solute--solvent\ninterface with a nonlinear function of the local electric field, giving what we\nhave called a solvation-layer interface condition (SLIC). The second\nmodification is a simple treatment of the microscopic interface potential\n(static potential). We show that the resulting model exhibits high accuracy\nwithout the need for fitting solute atom radii in a state-dependent fashion.\nCompared to experimental results in nine water--co-solvent mixtures, SLIC\npredicts transfer free energies to within 2.5 kJ/mol. The co-solvents include\nboth protic and aprotic species, as well as biologically relevant denaturants\nsuch as urea and dimethylformamide. Furthermore, our results indicate that the\ninterface potential is essential to reproduce entropies and heat capacities.\nThe present work, together with previous studies of SLIC illustrating its\naccuracy for biomolecules in water, indicates it as a promising dielectric\ncontinuum model for accurate predictions of molecular solvation in a wide range\nof conditions.\n", "  We have designed, built, and characterized a high-resolution objective lens\nthat is compatible with an ultra-high vacuum environment. The lens system\nexploits the principle of the Weierstrass-sphere solid immersion lens to reach\na numerical aperture (NA) of 0.92. Tailored to the requirements of optical\nlattice experiments, the objective lens features a relatively long working\ndistance of 150 micrometers. Our two-lens design is remarkably insensitive to\nmechanical tolerances in spite of the large NA. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthe application of a tapered optical fiber tip, as used in scanning near-field\noptical microscopy, to measure the point spread function of a high NA optical\nsystem. From the point spread function, we infer the wavefront aberration for\nthe entire field of view of about 75 micrometers. Pushing the NA of an optical\nsystem to its ultimate limit enables novel applications in quantum technologies\nsuch as quantum control of atoms in optical microtraps with an unprecedented\nspatial resolution and photon collection efficiency.\n", "  We investigate the possible existence of spin polarization and color\nsuperconductivity in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a tensor-type\ninteraction at finite density and temperature. The thermodynamic potential is\ncalculated by the functional integral method. Numerical results indicate that\nat low temperature and quark chemical potential the chiral condensed phase\nexists, and at intermediate chemical potential the color superconducting phase\nappears. In addition, depending on the magnitude of the tensor coupling, at\nlarge chemical potential and low temperature, a color superconducting phase and\na spin polarized phase may coexist while at intermediate temperatures only the\nspin polarized phase occurs.\n", "  New measurements from ATLAS at the LHC are presented on the total cross\nsection at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV from elastic scattering using the ALFA sub-detector\nand on the inelastic cross section at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the MBTS\nsub-detector.\n", "  Quantum annealing is guaranteed to find the ground state of optimization\nproblems in the adiabatic limit. Recent work [Phys. Rev. X 6, 031010 (2016)]\nhas found that for some barrier tunneling problems, quantum annealing can be\nrun much faster than is adiabatically required. Specifically, an $n$-qubit\noptimization problem was presented for which a non-adiabatic, or diabatic,\nannealing algorithm requires only constant runtime, while an adiabatic\nannealing algorithm requires a runtime polynomial in $n$.\n  Here we show that this non-adiabatic speed-up is a direct result of a\nspecific symmetry in the studied problems. In the more general case, no such\nnon-adiabatic speed-up occurs. We furthermore show why the special case\nachieves this speed-up compared to the general case. We conclude with the\nobservation that the adiabatic annealing algorithm has a necessary and\nsufficient runtime that is quadratically better than the standard quantum\nadiabatic condition suggests.\n", "  Predictive power in theoretical nuclear physics has been a major concern in\nthe study of nuclear structure and reactions. The Effective Field Theory (EFT)\nbased on chiral expansions provides a model independent hierarchy for many body\nforces at long distances but their predictive power may be undermined by the\nregularization scheme de- pendence induced by the counterterms and encoding the\nshort distances dynamics which seem to dominate the uncertainties. We analyze\nseveral examples including zero energy NN scattering or perturbative\ncounterterm-free peripheral scattering where one would ex- pect these methods\nto work best and unveil relevant systematic discrepancies when a fair\ncomparison to the Granada-2013 NN-database and partial wave analysis is\nundertaken.\n", "  Warm dense matter is one of the most active frontiers in plasma physics due\nto its relevance for dense astrophysical objects as well as for novel\nlaboratory experiments in which matter is being strongly compressed e.g. by\nhigh-power lasers. Its description is theoretically very challenging as it\ncontains correlated quantum electrons at finite temperature---a system that\ncannot be accurately modeled by standard analytical or ground state approaches.\nRecently several breakthroughs have been achieved in the field of fermionic\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations. First, it was shown that exact simulations of\na finite model system ($30 \\dots 100$ electrons) is possible that avoid any\nsimplifying approximations such as fixed nodes [Schoof {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 115}, 130402 (2015)]. Second, a novel way to accurately extrapolate\nthese results to the thermodynamic limit was reported by Dornheim {\\em et al.}\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 117}, 156403 (2016)]. As a result, now thermodynamic\nresults for the warm dense electron gas are available that have an\nunprecedented accuracy on the order of $0.1\\%$. Here we present an overview on\nthese results and discuss limitations and future directions.\n", "  Ordered assemblies of magnetic atoms on the surface of conventional\nsuperconductors can be used to engineer topological superconducting phases and\nrealize Majorana fermion quasiparticles (MQPs) in a condensed matter setting.\nRecent experiments have shown that chains of Fe atoms on Pb generically have\nthe required electronic characteristics to form a 1D topological superconductor\nand have revealed spatially resolved signatures of localized MQPs at the ends\nof such chains. Here we report higher resolution measurements of the same\natomic chain system performed using a dilution refrigerator scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM). With significantly better energy resolution than previous\nstudies, we show that the zero bias peak (ZBP) in Fe chains has no detectable\nsplitting from hybridization with other states. The measurements also reveal\nthat the ZBP exhibits a distinctive 'double eye' spatial pattern on nanometer\nlength scales. Theoretically we show that this is a general consequence of STM\nmeasurements of MQPs with substantial spectral weight in the superconducting\nsubstrate, a conclusion further supported by measurements of Pb overlayers\ndeposited on top of the Fe chains. Finally, we report experiments performed\nwith superconducting tips in search of the particle-hole symmetric MQP\nsignature expected in such measurements.\n", "  The E36 experiment recently conducted at J-PARC by the TREK Collaboration\nwill provide a precise mesurement of the decay ratio $ R_K = \\Gamma(K^+\n\\rightarrow e^+\\nu_e) / \\Gamma(K^+ \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}) $ with the aim\nof testing lepton universality, a basic assumption of the Standard Model (SM).\nThe SM prediction for the decay ratio $R_K$ is highly precise ($\\delta R_K /\nR_K = 4 \\times 10^{-4}$) and any observed deviation from this prediction would\nclearly indicate the existence of new physics. The E36 experimental apparatus,\ndesigned to offer small systematic errors, was installed at the J-PARC K1.1BR\nkaon beam line in the fall of 2014, fully commissioned in the spring of 2015,\nand the production data were collected in the fall of 2015. A scintillating\nfiber target was used to stop a beam of $1.2 \\times 10^6 K^+$ per spill. The\n$K^+$ decay products were then momentum analyzed by a 12-sector superconducting\ntoroidal spectrometer and charged particles were tracked with high precision by\nMulti-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) combined with a photon calorimeter with\na large solid angle ($75\\%$ of $4\\pi$) and 3 different particle identification\nsystems. Details of the E36 experimental apparatus, as well as the status of\nthe data analysis will be presented.\n", "  Knowledge of the equation of state of the baryon matter plays a decisive role\nin the description of neutron stars. With an increase of the baryon density the\nfilling of Fermi seas of hyperons and $\\Delta$ isobars becomes possible. Their\ninclusion into standard relativistic mean-field models results in a strong\nsoftening of the equation of state and a lowering of the maximum neutron star\nmass below the measured values. We extend a relativistic mean-field model with\nscaled hadron masses and coupling constants developed in our previous works and\ntake into account now not only hyperons but also the $\\Delta$ isobars. We\nanalyze available empirical information to put constraints on coupling\nconstants of $\\Delta$s to mesonic mean fields. We show that the resulting\nequation of state satisfies majority of presently known experimental\nconstraints.\n", "  In Poincar\\'e-covariant continuum treatments of the three valence-quark\nbound-state problem, the force behind dynamical chiral symmetry breaking also\ngenerates nonpointlike, interacting diquark correlations in the nucleon and its\nresonances. We detail the impact of these correlations on the nucleon's elastic\nand nucleon-to-Roper transition electromagnetic form factors, providing\nflavour-separation versions that can be tested at modern facilities.\n", "  We show that effective field theory techniques can be applied in the high\ntemperature $T$ regime of plasmas to improve the accuracy of the physics of the\nhard scales (or scales of order $T$), and as a by-product, also that of the\nsoft scales (or scales of order $gT$). At leading order in the coupling\nconstant the hard scales of the plasma can be viewed as on-shell classical\nparticles. Based on this observation, and without any reference to the state of\nthe system, we derive an effective field theory describing the quantum\nfluctuations around an on-shell fermion with energy $p$, described as a set of\nhigh dimension operators over the on-shell energy $p$. When applied to systems\nclose to thermal equilibrium, where for most on-shell particles $p \\sim T$, we\nshow that the on-shell effective field theory (OSEFT) properly describes the\nHTL photon polarization tensor of QED, and its 1/T corrections. For the soft\nscales the first non-vanishing power correction turns out to be a perturbative\ncorrection to the HTL result.\n", "  A collisionless kinetic plasma model may often be cast as an\ninfinite-dimensional noncanonical Hamiltonian system. I show that, when this is\nthe case, the model can be discretized in space and particles while preserving\nits Hamiltonian structure, thereby producing a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian\nsystem that approximates the original kinetic model. I apply the general theory\nto two example systems: the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system with spin, and a\ngyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell system.\n", "  The versatile Arbitrary-DERivative (ADER) scheme is cast in a multilevel\nframework (ML-ADER) for fast solution of system of linear hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equations. The solution is cycled through spatial operators of\nvarying accuracy while retaining highest-order accuracy by the use of a forcing\nfunction. Accuracy analysis of the multilevel framework including in the\nML-ADER form is carried out in time-domain as well as frequency-domain. Results\nare obtained for benchmark problems in computational aeroacoustics at a much\nreduced computational cost.\n", "  The adiabatic quantum computation is a universal and robust method of quantum\ncomputing. In this architecture, the problem can be solved by adiabatically\nevolving the quantum processor from the ground state of a simple initial\nHamiltonian to that of a final one, which encodes the solution of the problem.\nBy far, there is no experimental realization of adiabatic quantum computation\non a single solid spin system under ambient conditions, which has been proved\nto be a compatible candidate for scalable quantum computation. In this letter,\nwe report on the first experimental realization of an adiabatic quantum\nalgorithm on a single solid spin system under ambient conditions. All elements\nof adiabatic quantum computation, including initial state preparation,\nadiabatic evolution, and final state readout, are realized experimentally. As\nan example, we factored 35 into its prime factors 5 and 7 on our adiabatic\nquantum processor.\n", "  Many new states in the charmonium mass region were recently discovered by\nBaBar, Belle, CLEO-c, CDF, D0, BESIII, LHCb and CMS Collaborations. We use the\nQCD Sum Rule approach to study the possible structure of some of these states.\n", "  We show that amplitude chimeras in ring networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators\nwith symmetry-breaking nonlocal coupling represent saddle-states in the\nunderlying phase space of the network. Chimera states are composed of\ncoexisting spatial domains of coherent and of incoherent oscillations. We\ncalculate the Floquet exponents and the corresponding eigenvectors in\ndependence upon the coupling strength and range, and discuss the implications\nfor the phase space structure. The existence of at least one positive real part\nof the Floquet exponents indicates an unstable manifold in phase space, which\nexplains the nature of these states as long-living transients. Additionally, we\nfind a Stuart-Landau network of minimum size $N=12$ exhibiting amplitude\nchimeras\n", "  We consider a model of an electron in a crystal moving under the influence of\nan external electric field: Schr\\\"{o}dinger's equation with a potential which\nis the sum of a periodic function and a general smooth function. We identify\ntwo dimensionless parameters: (re-scaled) Planck's constant and the ratio of\nthe lattice spacing to the scale of variation of the external potential. We\nconsider the special case where both parameters are equal and denote this\nparameter $\\epsilon$. In the limit $\\epsilon \\downarrow 0$, we prove the\nexistence of solutions known as semiclassical wavepackets which are asymptotic\nup to `Ehrenfest time' $t \\sim \\ln 1/\\epsilon$. To leading order, the center of\nmass and average quasi-momentum of these solutions evolve along trajectories\ngenerated by the classical Hamiltonian given by the sum of the Bloch band\nenergy and the external potential. We then derive all corrections to the\nevolution of these observables proportional to $\\epsilon$. The corrections\ndepend on the gauge-invariant Berry curvature of the Bloch band, and a coupling\nto the evolution of the wave-packet envelope which satisfies Schr\\\"{o}dinger's\nequation with a time-dependent harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. This infinite\ndimensional coupled `particle-field' system may be derived from an `extended'\n$\\epsilon$-dependent Hamiltonian. It is known that such coupling of observables\n(discrete particle-like degrees of freedom) to the wave-envelope (continuum\nfield-like degrees of freedom) can have a significant impact on the overall\ndynamics.\n", "  Quantum channels can describe all transformations allowed by quantum\nmechanics. We provide an explicit universal protocol to construct all possible\nquantum channels, using a single qubit ancilla with quantum non-demolition\nreadout and adaptive control. Our construction is efficient in both physical\nresources and circuit depth, and can be demonstrated using superconducting\ncircuits and various other physical platforms. There are many applications of\nquantum channel construction, including system stabilization and quantum error\ncorrection, Markovian and exotic channel simulation, implementation of\ngeneralized quantum measurements and more general quantum instruments.\nEfficient construction of arbitrary quantum channels opens up exciting new\npossibilities for quantum control, quantum sensing and information processing\ntasks.\n", "  Epitaxial Fe/magnesium gallium spinel oxide (MgGa2O4)/Fe(001) magnetic tunnel\njunctions (MTJs) were fabricated by magnetron sputtering. Tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) ratio up to 121% at room temperature (196% at 4 K) was\nobserved, suggesting a TMR enhancement by the coherent tunneling effect in the\nMgGa2O4 barrier. The MgGa2O4 layer had a spinel structure and it showed good\nlattice matching with the Fe layers owing to slight tetragonal lattice\ndistortion of MgGa2O4. Barrier thickness dependence of the tunneling resistance\nand current-voltage characteristics revealed that the barrier height of the\nMgGa2O4 barrier is much lower than that in an MgAl2O4 barrier. This study\ndemonstrates the potential of Ga-based spinel oxides for MTJ barriers having a\nlarge TMR ratio at a low resistance area product.\n", "  The two point gluon and ghost correlation functions and the three gluon\nvertex are investigated, in the Landau gauge, using lattice simulations. For\nthe two point functions, we discuss the approach to the continuum limit looking\nat the dependence on the lattice spacing and volume. The analytical structure\nof the propagators is also investigated by computing the corresponding spectral\nfunctions using an implementation of the Tikhonov regularisation to solve the\nintegral equation. For the three point function we report results when the\nmomentum of one of the gluon lines is set to zero and discuss its implications.\n", "  Double Field Theory (DFT) is a low-energy effective theory of a manifestly\n$O(D,D)$ invariant formulation of the closed string theory when toroidally\ncompactified dimensions are present. The theory is based on a doubled spacetime\nstructure and, in order to preserve the gauge symmetry provided by the\ninvariance under generalized diffeomorphisms, a constraint has to be imposed on\nfields and gauge parameters. In this paper, we propose a DFT-inspired\nSupergravity by using a suitable {\\em star product} that implements such\nconstraint and the corresponding algebraic structure is explored. We get a\nconsistent DFT in which also an orthogonality condition of momenta is necessary\nfor having a closed gauge algebra. In constructing this theory, we start from\nthe simplest case of doubling one spatial dimension where the action is\nuniquely determined, without ambiguities, by the gauge symmetry. Then, the\nextension to the generic $O(D, D)$ case is presented. The result is consistent\nwith the closed string field theory.\n", "  Searching for the ideal glass transition, we exploit the ability of glassy\npolymer films to explore low energy states in remarkably short time scales. We\nuse 30 nm thick polystyrene (PS) films, which in the supercooled state\nbasically display the bulk polymer equilibrium thermodynamics and dynamics. We\nshow that in the glassy state, this system exhibits two mechanisms of\nequilibrium recovery. The faster one, active well below the kinetic glass\ntransition temperature ($T_g$), allows massive enthalpy recovery. This implies\nthat the 'fictive' temperature ($T_f$) reaches values as low as the predicted\nKauzmann temperature ($T_K$) for PS. Once the thermodynamic state corresponding\nto $T_f = T_K$ is reached, no further decrease of enthalpy is observed. This is\ninterpreted as a signature of the ideal glass transition.\n", "  We introduce a new approach for the correlation energy of one- and two-valley\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems. Our approach is based on a random\nphase approximation at high densities and a classical approach at low\ndensities, with interpolation between the two limits. This approach gives\nexcellent agreement with available Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We\nemploy the two-valley 2DEG model to describe the electron correlations in\nmonolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The zero-temperature\ntransition from a Fermi liquid to a quantum Wigner crystal phase in monolayer\nTMDs is obtained using density-functional theory within the local-density\napproximation. Consistent with QMC, we find that electrons crystallize at\n$r_s=30.5$ in one-valley 2DEG. For two-valleys, we predict Wigner\ncrystallization at $r_s= 29.5$, indicating that valley degeneracy has little\neffect on the critical $r_s$, in contrast to an earlier claim.\n", "  An important background in detectors using liquid xenon for rare event\nsearches arises from the decays of radon and its daughters. We report for the\nfirst time a reduction of $^{222}$Rn in the gas phase above a liquid xenon\nreservoir. We show a reduction factor of $\\gtrsim 4$ for the $^{222}$Rn\nconcentration in boil-off xenon gas compared to the radon enriched liquid\nphase. A semiconductor-based $\\alpha$-detector and miniaturized proportional\ncounters are used to detect the radon. As the radon depletion in the boil-off\ngas is understood as a single-stage distillation process, this result\nestablishes the suitability of cryogenic distillation to separate radon from\nxenon down to the $10^{-15}\\,$mol/mol level.\n", "  We study the decomposition of the Coulomb integrals of periodic systems into\na tensor contraction of six matrices of which only two are distinct. We find\nthat the Coulomb integrals can be well approximated in this form already with\nsmall matrices compared to the number of real space grid points. The cost of\ncomputing the matrices scales as O(N^4) using a regularized form of the\nalternating least squares algorithm. The studied factorization of the Coulomb\nintegrals can be exploited to reduce the scaling of the computational cost of\nexpensive tensor contractions appearing in the amplitude equations of coupled\ncluster methods with respect to system size. We apply the developed\nmethodologies to calculate the adsorption energy of a single water molecule on\na hexagonal boron nitride monolayer in a plane wave basis set and periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  We propose a variant of the $D4$-$D8$ construction to describe the low energy\neffective theory of heavy-light mesons, interacting with the lowest lying\npseudoscalar and vector mesons. The heavy degrees of freedom are identified\nwith the $D8_L$-$D8_H$ string low energy modes, and are approximated near the\nworld volume of $N_f-1$ light $D8_L$ branes, by fundamental vector field valued\nin $U(N_f-1)$. The effective action follows from the reduction of the bulk\nD-brane Born-Infeld (DBI) and Chern-Simons (CS) actions, and is shown to\nexhibit both chiral and heavy-quark symmetry. The action interpolates\ncontinuously between the $U(N_f)$ case with massless mesons, and the $U(N_f-1)$\ncase with heavy-light mesons. The heavy-light meson radial spectrum is\nRegge-like. The one-pion and two-pion couplings to the heavy-light multiplets\nare evaluated. The partial widths for the charged decays $G\\rightarrow H+\\pi$\nare shown to be comparable to the recently reported full widths for both the\ncharm and bottom mesons.\n", "  Fundamental aspects of nonperturbative QCD dynamics which are not obvious\nfrom its classical Lagrangian, such as the emergence of a mass scale and\nconfinement, the existence of a zero mass bound state, the appearance of\nuniversal Regge trajectories and the breaking of chiral symmetry are\nincorporated from the onset in an effective theory based on superconformal\nquantum mechanics and its embedding in a higher dimensional gravitational\ntheory. In addition, superconformal quantum mechanics gives remarkable\nconnections between the light meson and nucleon spectra. This new approach to\nhadron physics is also suitable to describe nonperturbative QCD observables\nbased on structure functions, such as GPDs, which are not amenable to a\nfirst-principle computation. The formalism is also successful in the\ndescription of form factors, the nonperturbative behavior of the strong\ncoupling and diffractive processes. We also discuss in this article how the\nframework can be extended rather successfully to the heavy-light hadron sector.\n", "  Chimera states are complex spatio-temporal patterns that consist of\ncoexisting domains of coherent and incoherent dynamics. We study chimera states\nin a network of non-locally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. We investigate\nthe impact of initial conditions in combination with non-local coupling. Based\non an analytical argument, we show how the coupling phase and the coupling\nstrength are linked to the occurrence of chimera states, flipped profiles of\nthe mean phase velocity, and the transition from a phase- to an\namplitude-mediated chimera state.\n", "  Motivated by new technologies for designing and tailoring metamaterials, we\nseek properties for certain classes of nonlinear optical materials that allow\nroom for a reversibly controlled opacity-to-transparency phase transition\nthrough the application of external electromagnetic fields. We examine some\nmathematically simple models for the dielectric parameters of the medium and\ncompute the relevant geometric quantities that describe the speed and\npolarization of light rays.\n", "  The finding of Gravitational Waves by the aLIGO scientific and VIRGO\ncollaborations opens opportunities to better test and understand strong\ninteractions, both nuclear-hadronic and gravitational. Assuming General\nRelativity holds, one can constrain hadron physics at a neutron star. But\nprecise knowledge of the Equation of State and transport properties in hadron\nmatter can also be used to constrain the theory of gravity itself.\n  I review a couple of these opportunities in the context of modified f(R)\ngravity, the maximum mass of neutron stars, and progress in the Equation of\nState of neutron matter from the chiral effective field theory of QCD.\n", "  The definition of the intrinsic cut-off frequency ($f_T$) based on the\ncurrent gain equals to one (0 dB) is critically analyzed. A condition for the\nvalidity of the quasi-static estimation of $f_T$ is established in terms of the\ntemporal variations of the electric charge and electric flux on the drain,\nsource and gate terminals. Due to the displacement current, an electron\ntraversing the channel length generates a current pulse of finite temporal\nwidth. For electron devices where the intrinsic delay time of the current after\na transient perturbation is comparable to such width, the displacement currents\ncannot be neglected and the quasi-static approximation becomes inaccurate. We\nprovide numerical results for some ballistic transistors where the estimation\nof $f_T$ under the quasi-static approximation can be one order of magnitude\nlarger than predictions obtained from a time-dependent numerical simulations of\nthe intrinsic delay time (including particle and displacement currents). In\nother ballistic transistors, we show that the gate current phasor can be\nsmaller than the drain one at all frequencies, giving no finite value for\n$f_T$.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is a process that changes magnetic field topology in\nhighly conducting fluids. Within the standard Sweet-Parker model, this process\nwould be too slow to explain observations (e.g. solar flares). In reality, the\nprocess must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions\nof fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines\nand magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence, the reconnection is\nindependent of microscopic plasma properties, and may be much faster than\npreviously thought, as proposed in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) and tested in\nKowal et al. (2009, 2012). However, the considered turbulence in the\nLazarian-Vishniac model was imposed externally. In this work we consider\nreconnection-driven magnetized turbulence in realistic three-dimensional\ngeometry initiated by stochastic noise. We demonstrate through numerical\nsimulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate\nturbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the\nstatistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and\nanisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces\nKolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model.\nAnisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of\nreconnection outflows. Once the broad turbulent region is formed, the typical\nanisotropy scaling $l_\\parallel \\propto l_\\perp^{2/3}$ is formed, especially\nfor high resolution models, were the broader range of scales is available. The\ndecay of reconnection outflows to turbulent-like fluctuations, characterized by\ndifferent anisotropy scalings, strongly depends on $\\beta$ plasma. Moreover,\nthe estimated reconnection rates are weakly dependent on the resolution,\nsuggesting that no external processes are required to make reconnection fast.\n", "  We extract an effective Polyakov line action from an underlying SU(3) lattice\ngauge theory with dynamical fermions via the relative weights method. The\ncenter-symmetry breaking terms in the effective theory are fit to a form\nsuggested by effective action of heavy-dense quarks, and the effective action\nis solved at finite chemical potential by a mean field approach. We show\nresults for a small sample of lattice couplings, lattice actions, and lattice\nextensions in the time direction. We find in some instances that the long-range\ncouplings in the effective action are very important to the phase structure,\nand that these couplings are responsible for long-lived metastable states in\nthe effective theory. Only one of these states corresponds to the underlying\nlattice gauge theory.\n", "  Quark confinement is proposed to be a dual Meissner effect of nonAbelian\nkind. Important hints come from physics of strongly-coupled\ninfrared-fixed-point theories in N=2 supersymmetric QCD, which turn into\nconfining vacua under a small relevant perturbation. The quest for the\nsemiclassical origin of the nonAbelian monopoles, ubiquitous as the infrared\ndegrees of freedom in supersymmetric gauge theories, motivates us to study the\nquantum dynamics of 2D CP(N-1)model defined on a finite-width worldstrip, with\nvarious boundary conditions. The model is found to possess a unique phase\n(\"confinement phase\"), independent of the length of the string, showing the\nquantum persistence of the nonAbelian monopole.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation in 1+1 dimension with\nscalar-scalar self-interaction in the presence of external forces as well as\ndamping of the form $\\gamma^0 f(x,t) - i \\mu \\gamma^0 \\Psi$, where both $f,\n\\{f_j = r_i e^{i K_j x} \\}$ and $\\Psi$ are two-component spinors. We develop an\napproximate variational approach using collective coordinates (CC) for studying\nthe time dependent response of the solitary waves to these external forces. In\nour previous paper we assumed $K_j=K, ~ j=1,2$ which allowed a transformation\nto a simplifying coordinate system, and we also assumed the \"small\" component\nof the external force was zero. Here we include the effects of the small\ncomponent and also the case $K_1 \\neq K_2$ which dramatically modifies the\nbehavior of the solitary wave in the presence of these external forces.\n", "  We investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of a ring cavity filled with a\nnon-instantaneous Kerr medium and driven by a coherent injected beam. We show\nthe existence of a stable mixed-mode solution that can be either extended or\nlocalized in space. The mixed-mode solutions are obtained in a regime where\nTuring instability (often called modulational instability) interacts with\nself-pulsing phenomenon (Andronov-Hopf bifurcation). We numerically describe\nthe transition from stationary inhomogeneous solutions to a branch of\nmixed-mode solutions. We characterize this transition by constructing the\nbifurcation diagram associated with these solutions. Finally, we show stable\nlocalized mixed-mode solutions, which consist of time-periodic oscillations\nthat are localized in space.\n", "  The compensation of vertical drifts in toroidal magnetic fields through a\nwave-driven poloidal rotation is compared to compensation through the wave\ndriven toroidal current generation to support the classical magnetic rotational\ntransform. The advantages and drawbacks associated with the sustainment of a\nradial electric field are compared with those associated with the sustainment\nof a poloidal magnetic field both in terms of energy content and power\ndissipation. The energy content of a radial electric field is found to be\nsmaller than the energy content of a poloidal magnetic field for a similar set\nof orbits. The wave driven radial electric field generation efficiency is\nsimilarly shown, at least in the limit of large aspect ratio, to be larger than\nthe efficiency of wave-driven toroidal current generation.\n", "  Holographic theories with a local gravitational dual have a number of\nstriking features. Here I argue that many of these features are controlled by\nthe Eguchi-Kawai mechanism, which is proposed to be a hallmark of such\nholographic theories. Higher-spin holographic duality is presented as a failure\nof the Eguchi-Kawai mechanism, and its restoration illustrates the deformation\nof higher-spin theory into a proper string theory with a local gravitational\nlimit. AdS/CFT is used to provide a calculable extension of the Eguchi-Kawai\nmechanism to field theories on curved manifolds and thereby introduce\n\"topological volume independence.\" Finally, I discuss implications for a\ngeneral understanding of the extensivity of the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald\nentropy.\n", "  We present the current status of $\\varepsilon_K$ evaluated directly from the\nstandard model using lattice QCD inputs. The lattice QCD inputs include\n$\\hat{B}_K$, $\\xi_0$, $\\xi_2$, $|V_{us}|$, $m_c(m_c)$, and $|V_{cb}|$.\nRecently, FLAG has updated $\\hat{B}_K$, exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ has been updated\nwith new lattice data in the $\\bar{B}\\to D\\ell\\bar{\\nu}$ decay mode, and\nRBC-UKQCD has updated $\\xi_0$ and $\\xi_2$. We find that the standard model\nevaluation of $\\varepsilon_K$ with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ (lattice QCD inputs) is\n$3.2\\sigma$ lower than the experimental value, while that with inclusive\n$|V_{cb}|$ (heavy quark expansion) shows no tension.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenon of (inverse) magnetic catalysis for both the\ndeconfinement and chiral transition. We discriminate between the hard and soft\nwall model, which we suitably generalize to include a magnetic field. Our\nfindings show a critical deconfinement temperature going down, in contrast with\nthe chiral restoration temperature growing with increasing magnetic field. This\nis at odds with contemporary lattice data, so the quest for a holographic QCD\nmodel capable of capturing inverse magnetic catalysis in the chiral sector\nremains open.\n", "  We analyse the tension between the (indirect) measurements of the total cross\nsection, and show the impact of various assumptions on the extraction of the\nparameters from the elastic scattering amplitude, with a special attention to\nthe total cross section. In particular, the determination of the phase of the\nelastic scattering amplitude will play an important role, and we shall study it\nvia dispersion relations. We shall also examine the origin of the dependence on\nmomentum transfer of the slopes of the different parts of the scattering\namplitude in different models. We shall also give the results of another\nsimilar analysis based on a Regge-trajectory approach for the hadron scattering\namplitude.\n", "  We discuss charmed mesons in the covariant\nDyson-Schwinger-Bethe-Salpeter-equation approach. In particular we computed\nmasses, leptonic decay constants, and an orbital-angular-momentum decomposition\nfor a basic set of states. We also report an efficient way to treat the two\ncoupled quark propagator dressing functions via a single function.\n", "  Motivated by the striking modifications of jets observed both at RHIC and the\nLHC, significant progress towards the understanding of jet dynamics within QGP\nhas occurred over the last few years. In this talk, I review the recent\ntheoretical developments in the study of medium-induced jet evolution and\nenergy loss within a perturbative framework. The main mechanisms of energy loss\nand broadening will be firstly addressed with focus on leading particle\ncalculations beyond the eikonal approximation. Then, I will provide an overview\nof the modifications of the interference pattern between the different parton\nemitters that build up the parton shower when propagating through an extended\ncoloured medium. I will show that the interplay between color\ncoherence/decoherence that arises from such effects is the main mechanism for\nthe modification of the jet core angular structure. Finally, I discuss the\npossibility of a probabilistic picture of the parton shower evolution in the\nlimit of a very dense or infinite medium.\n", "  Recently, the GWU lattice group has evaluated high-precision phase-shift data\nfor $\\pi\\pi$ scattering in the $I = 1$, $J = 1$ channel. Unitary Chiral\nPerturbation Theory describes these data well around the resonance region and\nfor different pion masses. Moreover, it allows to extrapolate to the physical\npoint and estimate the effect of the missing $K\\bar{K}$ channel in the\ntwo-flavor lattice calculation. The absence of the strange quark in the lattice\ndata leads to a lower $\\rho$ mass, and the analysis with U$\\chi$PT shows that\nthe $K \\bar{K}$ channel indeed pushes the $\\pi\\pi$-scattering phase shift\nupward, having a surprisingly large effect on the $\\rho$-mass. The inelasticity\nis shown to be compatible with the experimental data. The analysis is then\nextended to all available two-flavor lattice simulations and similar mass\nshifts are observed. Chiral extrapolations of $N_f = 2 + 1$ lattice simulations\nfor the $\\rho(770)$ are also reported.\n", "  In this proceedings contribution, we discuss recent developments in the\nperturbative determination of the Equation of State of dense quark matter,\nrelevant for the microscopic description of neutron star cores. First, we\nintroduce the current state of the art in the problem, both at zero and small\ntemperatures, and then present results from two recent perturbative studies\nthat pave the way towards extending the EoS to higher orders in perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  Simplified dark matter models have been recently advocated as a powerful tool\nto exploit the complementarity between dark matter direct detection, indirect\ndetection and LHC experimental probes. Focusing on pseudoscalar mediators\nbetween the dark and visible sectors, we show that the simplified dark matter\nmodel phenomenology departs significantly from that of consistent\n${SU(2)_{\\mathrm{L}} \\times U(1)_{\\mathrm{Y}}}$ gauge invariant completions. We\ndiscuss the key physics simplified models fail to capture, and its impact on\nLHC searches. Notably, we show that resonant mono-Z searches provide\ncompetitive sensitivities to standard mono-jet analyses at $13$ TeV LHC.\n", "  We report on a recent QCD based research on hybrid mesons containing $c\\bar\nc$ or $b\\bar b$ quarks. We present results for the spectrum, the decay widths\nto heavy quarkonium, and the role of mixing with the latter. We point out that\nmixing with heavy quarkonium provides a potentially large source of spin\nsymmetry breaking. We identify candidates to hybrid mesons among the so called\nXYZ states in the charmonium and bottomonium spectrum.\n", "  We theoretically examine the effect of external optical injection on the\nspatio-temporal dynamics of class-B broad-area lasers. We demonstrate that\noptical injection can efficiently stabilize the intrinsic transverse\ninstabilities in such lasers associated with both the boundaries of the pumping\narea and with the bulk nonlinearities of the active medium. Stabilizing action\nof optical injection is shown to be closely related to the suppression of\ninherent relaxation oscillations behavior.\n", "  A study of the inclusive production of a pair of hadrons (a \"dihadron\"\nsystem), having high transverse momenta and separated by a large interval of\nrapidity, is presented. This process has much in common with the widely\ndiscussed Mueller--Navelet jet production and can be also used to access the\nBFKL dynamics at proton colliders. Large contributions enhanced by logarithms\nof energy can be resummed in perturbation theory within the BFKL formalism in\nthe next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The experimental study of dihadron\nproduction would provide with an additional clear channel to test the BFKL\ndynamics. The first theoretical predictions for cross sections and azimuthal\nangle correlations of the two hadrons produced with LHC kinematics are\npresented.\n", "  A study of differential cross sections for the production of three and four\njets in multi-Regge kinematics is presented. The main focus lies on the\nazimuthal angle dependences in events with two forward/backward jets are tagged\nin the final state. Furthermore, the tagging of one or two extra jets in more\ncentral regions of the detector with a relative separation in rapidity from\neach other is requested. It is found that the dependence of the cross sections\non the transverse momenta and the rapidities of the central jet(s) can offer\nnew means of studying the onset of BFKL dynamics.\n", "  Solutions for the three-gluon and quark-gluon vertices from Dyson-Schwinger\nequations and the three-particle irreducible formalism are discussed. Dynamical\nquarks (``unquenching'') change the three-gluon vertex via the quark-triangle\ndiagrams which themselves include fully dressed quark-gluon vertex functions.\nOn the other hand, the quark-swordfish diagram is, at least with the model used\nfor the two-quark-two-gluon vertex employed here, of minor importance. For the\nleading tensor structure of the three-gluon vertex the \"unquenching\" effect can\nbe summarized for the nonperturbative part as a shift of the related dressing\nfunction towards the infrared.\n", "  The thermal-photon emission from strongly coupled gauge theories at finite\ntemperature is calculated by using holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano\nlimit (V-QCD). These emission rates are then embedded in hydrodynamic\nsimulations combined with prompt photons from hard scattering and the thermal\nphotons from hadron gas to analyze the spectra and anisotropic flow of direct\nphotons at RHIC and LHC. The results from different sources responsible for the\nthermal photons in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) including the weakly coupled\nQGP (wQGP) from perturbative calculations, strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}$=4\nsuper Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma (as a benchmark for reference), and Gubser's\nphenomenological model mimicking the strongly coupled QGP (sQGP) are then\ncompared. It is found that the direct-photon spectra are enhanced in the\nstrongly coupled scenario compared with the ones in the wQGP, especially at\nintermediate and high momenta, which improve the agreements with data.\nMoreover, by using IP-glassma initial states, both the elliptic flow and\ntriangular flow of direct photons are amplified at high momenta ($p_T$>2.5 GeV)\nfor V-QCD, while they are suppressed at low momenta compared to wQGP. The\ndistinct results in holography stem from the blue-shift of emission rates in\nstrong coupling. In addition, the spectra and flow in small collision systems\nwere evaluated for future comparisons. It is found that thermal photons from\nthe deconfined phase are substantial to reconcile the spectra and flow at high\nmomenta.\n", "  The electrical conductivity of metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) quickly\nsaturates with respect to bias voltage due to scattering from a large\npopulation of optical phonons. Decay of these dominant scatterers in pristine\nCNTs is too slow to offset an increased generation rate at high voltage bias.\nWe demonstrate from first principles that encapsulation of 1D atomic chains\nwithin a single-walled CNT can enhance decay of \"hot\" phonons by providing\nadditional channels for thermalisation. Pacification of the phonon population\ngrowth reduces electrical resistivity of metallic CNTs by 51% for an example\nsystem with encapsulated beryllium.\n", "  We construct 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories on an infinite family of 4D toric\nmanifolds with the topology of connected sums of $S^2 \\times S^2$. These\ntheories are constructed through the dimensional reduction along a non-trivial\n$U(1)$-fiber of 5D theories on toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. We discuss the\nconditions under which such reductions can be carried out and give a partial\nclassification result of the resulting 4D manifolds. We calculate the partition\nfunctions of these 4D theories and they involve both instanton and\nanti-instanton contributions, thus generalizing Pestun's famous result on\n$S^4$.\n", "  We model a set of point-to-point transports on a network as a system of\npolydisperse interacting self-avoiding walks (SAWs) over a finite square\nlattice. The ends of each SAW may be located both at random, uniformly\ndistributed, positions or with one end fixed at a lattice corner. The total\nenergy of the system is computed as the sum over all SAWs, which may represent\neither the time needed to complete the transport over the network, or the\nresources needed to build the networking infrastructure. We focus especially on\nthe second aspect by assigning a concave cost function to each site to\nencourage path overlap. A Simulated Annealing optimization, based on a modified\nBFACF Montecarlo algorithm developed for polymers, is used to probe the complex\nconformational substates structure. We characterize the average cost gains (and\npath-length variation) for increasing polymer density with respect to a\nDijkstra routing and find a non-monotonic behavior as previously found in\nrandom networks. We observe the expected phase transition when switching from a\nconvex to a concave cost function (e.g., $x^\\gamma$, where $x$ represents the\nnode overlap) and the emergence of ergodicity breaking, finally we show that\nthe space of ground states for $\\gamma<1$ is compatible with an ultrametric\nstructure as seen in many complex systems such as some spin glasses.\n", "  We probe a slice of the massive winding sector of bosonic string theory from\ntoroidal compactifications of Double Field Theory (DFT). This string subsector\ncorresponds to states containing one left and one right moving oscillators. We\nperform a generalized Kaluza Klein compactification of DFT on generic\n$2n$-dimensional toroidal constant backgrounds and show that, up to third order\nin fluctuations, the theory coincides with the corresponding effective theory\nof the bosonic string compactified on $n$-dimensional toroidal constant\nbackgrounds, obtained from three-point amplitudes. The comparison between both\ntheories is facilitated by noticing that generalized diffeomorphisms in DFT\nallow to fix generalized harmonic gauge conditions that help in identifying the\nphysical degrees of freedom. These conditions manifest as conformal anomaly\ncancellation requirements on the string theory side. The explicit expression\nfor the gauge invariant effective action containing the physical massless\nsector (gravity+antisymmetric+gauge+ scalar fields) coupled to towers of\ngeneralized Kaluza Klein massive states (corresponding to compact momentum and\nwinding modes) is found. The action acquires a very compact form when written\nin terms of fields carrying $O(n,n)$ indices, and is explicitly T-duality\ninvariant. The global algebra associated to the generalized Kaluza Klein\ncompactification is discussed.\n", "  A droplet that impacts onto a solid substrate deforms in a complex dynamics.\nTo extract the principal mechanisms that dominate this dynamics we deploy\nnumerical simulations based on the phase field method. Direct comparison with\nexperiments suggests that a dissipation local to the contact line limits the\ndroplet spreading dynamics and its scaled maximum spreading radius\n$\\beta_\\mathrm{max}$. By assuming linear response through a drag force at the\ncontact line, our simulations rationalize experimental observations for droplet\nimpact on both smooth and rough substrates, measured through a single contact\nline friction parameter $\\mu_f$. Moreover, our analysis shows that at low and\nintermediate impact speeds dissipation at the contact line limits the dynamics\nand we describe $\\beta_\\mathrm{max}$ by the scaling law $\\beta_\\mathrm{max}\n\\sim (Re \\mu_\\mathrm{l}/\\mu_f)^{1/2}$ that is a function of the droplet\nviscosity ($\\mu_\\mathrm{l}$) and its Reynolds number ($Re$).\n", "  We review a testable dark matter (DM) model outside of the standard WIMP\nparadigm. The model is unique in a sense that the observed ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm\ndark} \\simeq \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ for visible and dark matter densities finds\nits natural explanation as a result of their common QCD origin when both types\nof matter (DM and visible) are formed during the QCD transition and both are\nproportional to single dimensional parameter of the system, $\\Lambda_{\\rm\nQCD}$. We argue that the charge separation effect also inevitably occurs during\nthe same QCD transition in the presence of the $\\cal{CP}$ odd axion field\n$a(x)$. It leads to preferential formation of one species of nuggets on the\nscales of the visible Universe where the axion field $a(x)$ is coherent. A\nnatural outcome of this preferential evolution is that only one type of the\nvisible baryons (not anti- baryons) remain in the system after the nuggets\ncomplete their formation. Unlike conventional WIMP dark matter candidates, the\nnuggets and anti-nuggets are strongly interacting but macroscopically large\nobjects. The rare events of annihilation of the anti-nuggets with visible\nmatter lead to a number of observable effects. We argue that the relative\nintensities for a number of measured excesses of emission from the centre of\ngalaxy (covering more than 11 orders of magnitude) are determined by standard\nand well established physics. At the same time the absolute intensity of\nemission is determined by a single new fundamental parameter of the theory, the\naxion mass, $10^{-6} {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m_a \\lesssim 10^{-3}{\\rm eV}$. Finally,\nwe comment on implications of these studies for the axion search experiments,\nincluding microwave cavity and the Orpheus experiments.\n", "  At very high densities, as for example in the core of a neutron star, matter\nmay appear in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, which is a superfluid. This\nphase features topologically stable vortex solutions, which arise in a spinning\nsuperfluid as localized configurations carrying quanta of angular momentum.\nDespite the topological stability of these vortices they are not the lowest\nenergy state of the system at neutron star densities and decay into triplets of\nsemi-superfluid fluxtubes. In these proceedings we report on the progress of\nour numerical study in the Ginzburg-Landau approach, where we investigate\nlattices of semi-superfluid fluxtubes. The fluxtubes are obtained through\ncontrolled decay of global vortex configurations in the presence of a gauge\nfield. Understanding the dynamics of semi-superfluid string configurations is\nimportant in the context of angular momentum transfer from a quark matter core\nof a neutron star beyond the core boundary, since not vortex-, but fluxtube\npinning seems to be the relevant mechanism in this scenario.\n", "  We present a new method of Stokes inversion of spectropolarimetric data and\nevaluate it by taking the example of a SUNRISE/IMaX observation. An archive of\nsynthetic Stokes profiles is obtained by the spectral synthesis of\nstate-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations and a realistic\ndegradation to the level of the observed data. The definition of a merit\nfunction allows the archive to be searched for the synthetic Stokes profiles\nthat match the observed profiles best. In contrast to traditional Stokes\ninversion codes, which solve the Unno-Rachkovsky equations for the polarized\nradiative transfer numerically and fit the Stokes profiles iteratively, the new\ntechnique provides the full set of atmospheric parameters. This gives us the\nability to start an MHD simulation that takes the inversion result as initial\ncondition. After a relaxation process of half an hour solar time we obtain\nphysically consistent MHD data sets with a target similar to the observation.\nThe new MHD simulation is used to repeat the method in a second iteration,\nwhich further improves the match between observation and simulation, resulting\nin a factor of 2.2 lower mean $\\chi^2$ value. One advantage of the new\ntechnique is that it provides the physical parameters on a geometrical height\nscale. It constitutes a first step towards inversions giving results consistent\nwith the MHD equations.\n", "  Top squark (stop) can be produced via QCD interaction but also the\nelectroweak interaction at the LHC. In this paper, we investigate the\nobservability of the associated production of stop and chargino, $pp \\to\n\\tilde{t}_1\\tilde{\\chi}^-_1$, in compressed electroweakino scenario at the 14\nTeV LHC. Due to the small mass-splitting between the lightest neutralino\n($\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1$) and chargino ($\\tilde{\\chi}^-_1$), such a single stop\nproduction can give a mono-top signature through the stop decay $\\tilde{t}_1\n\\to t \\tilde{\\chi}^0_1$. Focusing on the leptonic mono-top channel, we propose\na lab-frame observable $\\cos\\theta_{b\\ell}$ to reduce the SM backgrounds in\nvirtue of a boosted top quark from the stop decay. We find that the single stop\nproduction can be probed at $2\\sigma$ level at the HL-LHC for\n$m_{\\tilde{t}_1}<760$ GeV and $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1}<150$ GeV.\n", "  In this paper we solve exactly the problem of the spectrum and Feynman\npropagator of a charged particle submitted to both an anharmonic oscillator in\nthe plane and a constant and homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary strength\naligned with the perpendicular direction to the plane. As we shall see in the\nbeginning of the letter the Hamiltonian, being a quadratic form, is easily\ndiagonalizable and the Classical Action can be used to construct the exact\nFeynman Propagator using the Stationary Phase Approximation. The result is\nuseful for the treatment of quasi two dimensional samples in the field of\nmagnetic effects in nano-structures and quantum optics. The presented solution,\nafter minor extensions, can also be used for motion in three dimensions, and in\nfact it has been used for years in such cases. Also it can be used as a good\nexercise of a Feynman Path Integral that can be calculated easily with just the\nhelp of the Classical Action.\n", "  In order to carry out research in the field of possible existence of a\nsterile neutrino the laboratory based on SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia)\nwas created to search for oscillations of reactor antineutrino. The prototype\nof a multi-section neutrino detector with liquid scintillator volume of 350 l\nwas installed in the middle of 2015. It is a moveable inside the passive\nshielding detector, which can be set at distance range from 6 to 11 meters from\nthe reactor core. Measurements of antineutrino flux at such short distances\nfrom the reactor core are carried out with moveable detector for the first\ntime. The measurements with full-scale detector with liquid scintillator volume\nof 3 m^3 (5x10 sections) was started only in June, 2016. The today available\ndata is presented in the article.\n", "  The investigation of 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials is a vibrant, fast\nmoving and still growing interdisciplinary area of research. 2D vdW materials\nare truly 2D crystals with strong covalent in-plane bonds and weak van der\nWaals interaction between the layers with a variety of different electronic,\noptical and mechanical properties. A very prominent class of 2D materials are\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and amongst them particularly the\nsemiconducting subclass. Their properties include bandgaps in the near-infrared\nto the visible range, decent charge carrier mobility together with high\n(photo-)catalytic and mechanical stability and exotic many body phenomena.\nThese characteristics make the materials highly attractive for both fundamental\nresearch as well as innovative device applications. Furthermore, the materials\nexhibit a strong light matter interaction providing a high sun light absorbance\nof up to 15% in the monolayer limit, strong scattering cross section in Raman\nexperiments and access to excitonic phenomena in vdW heterostructures. This\nreview focuses on the light matter interaction in MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2\nthat is dictated by the materials complex dielectric functions and on the\nmultiplicity of studying the first order phonon modes by Raman spectroscopy to\ngain access to several material properties such as doping, strain, defects and\ntemperature. 2D materials provide an interesting platform to stack them into\nvdW heterostructures without the limitation of lattice mismatch resulting in\nnovel devices for application but also to study exotic many body interaction\nphenomena such as interlayer excitons. Future perspectives of semiconducting\nTMDs and their heterostructures for applications in optoelectronic devices will\nbe examined and routes to study emergent fundamental problems and many-body\nquantum phenomena under excitations with photons will be discussed.\n", "  When constructing a Wilson chain to represent a quantum impurity model, the\neffects of truncated bath modes are neglected. We show that their influence can\nbe kept track of systematically by constructing an \"open Wilson chain\" in which\neach site is coupled to a separate effective bath of its own. As a first\napplication, we use the method to cure the so-called mass-flow problem that can\narise when using standard Wilson chains to treat impurity models with\nasymmetric bath spectral functions at finite temperature. We demonstrate this\nfor the strongly sub-Ohmic spin-boson model at quantum criticality where we\ndirectly observe the flow towards a Gaussian critical fixed point.\n", "  The numerical solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation is a well\nestablished method to simulate the dynamics, including the self-interaction\nwith its own wake field, of an electron bunch in a storage ring. In this paper\nwe present Inovesa, a modularly extensible program that uses OpenCL to\nmassively parallelize the computation. It allows a standard desktop PC to work\nwith appropriate accuracy and yield reliable results within minutes. We provide\nnumerical stability-studies over a wide parameter range and compare our\nnumerical findings to known results. Simulation results for the case of\ncoherent synchrotron radiation will be compared to measurements that probe the\neffects of the micro-bunching instability occurring in the short bunch\noperation at ANKA. It will be shown that the impedance model based on the\nshielding effect of two parallel plates can not only describe the instability\nthreshold, but also the presence of multiple regimes that show differences in\nthe emission of coherent synchrotron radiation.\n", "  We discuss nuclear matter and the transition to quark matter in the\ndecompactified limit of the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Nuclear matter is included\nthrough instantons on the flavor branes of the model. Our approximation is\nbased on the flat-space solution, but we allow for a dynamical instanton width\nand deformation and compute the energetically preferred number of instanton\nlayers in the bulk as a function of the baryon chemical potential. We determine\nthe regions in parameter space where the binding energy of nuclear matter is\nlike in QCD, and compute the phase diagram in the plane of temperature and\nchemical potential.\n", "  We address the question of the stability of the (fractional) quantum Hall\neffect (QHE) in presence of pseudomagnetic disorder generated by mechanical\ndeformations of a graphene sheet. Neglecting the potential disorder and taking\ninto account only strain-induced random pseudomagnetic fields, it is possible\nto write down a Laughlin-like trial ground-state wave function explicitly.\nExploiting the Laughlin plasma analogy, we demonstrate that in the case of\nfluctuating pseudomagnetic fluxes of relatively small amplitude both the\ninteger and fractional quantum Hall effects are always stable upon the\ndeformations. By contrast, in the case of bubble-induced pseudomagnetic fields\nin graphene on a substrate (a small number of large fluxes) the disorder can be\nstrong enough to cause a glass transition in the corresponding classical\nCoulomb plasma, resulting in the destruction of fractional quantum Hall regime\nand in a quantum phase transition to a non-ergodic state of the lowest Landau\nlevel.\n", "  We consider quantum scattering of particles in media exhibiting strong\ndispersion degeneracy. In particular, we study flat-banded lattices and\nlinearly dispersed energy bands. The former constitute a prime example of\nsingle-particle frustration while the latter show degeneracy at the few- and\nmany-particle level. We investigate both impurity and two-body scattering and\nshow that, quite generally, scattering does not occur, which we relate to the\nfact that transition matrices vanish on the energy shell. We prove that\nscattering is instead replaced by projections onto band-projected eigenstates\nof the interaction potential. We then use the general results to obtain\nlocalised flat band states that are eigenstates of impurity potentials with\nvanishing eigenvalues in one-dimensional flat bands and study the particular\ncase of a sawtooth lattice. We also uncover the relation between certain\nsolutions of one-dimensional systems that have been categorised as \"strange\",\nand the scattering states in linearly dispersed continuum systems.\n", "  Context. Radio-loud AGNs with powerful relativistic jets are thought to be\nassociated with rapidly spinning black holes (BHs). BH spin-up may result from\na number of processes, including accretion of matter onto the BH itself, and\ncatastrophic events such as BH-BH mergers. Aims. We study the intriguing\nproperties of the powerful (L_bol ~ 10^47 erg s^-1) radio-loud quasar 3C 186.\nThis object shows peculiar features both in the images and in the spectra.\nMethods. We utilize near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to study the\nproperties of the host galaxy, and HST UV and Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical\nspectra to study the kinematics of the source. Chandra X-ray data are also used\nto better constrain the physical interpretation. Results. HST imaging shows\nthat the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 +- 0.1 arcsec (i.e. ~11 kpc) with\nrespect to the center of the host galaxy. Spectroscopic data show that the\nbroad emission lines are offset by -2140 +-390 km/s with respect to the narrow\nlines. Velocity shifts are often seen in QSO spectra, in particular in\nhigh-ionization broad emission lines. The host galaxy of the quasar displays a\ndistorted morphology with possible tidal features that are typical of the late\nstages of a galaxy merger. Conclusions. A number of scenarios can be envisaged\nto account for the observed features. While the presence of a peculiar outflow\ncannot be completely ruled out, all of the observed features are consistent\nwith those expected if the QSO is associated with a gravitational wave (GW)\nrecoiling BH. Future detailed studies of this object will allow us to confirm\nthis type of scenario and will enable a better understanding of both the\nphysics of BH-BH mergers and the phenomena associated with the emission of GW\nfrom astrophysical sources.\n", "  We apply a mixing framework to the light meson systems and examine tetraquark\npossibility in the scalar channel. In the diquark-antidiquark model, a scalar\ndiquark is a compact object when its color and flavor structures are in\n($\\bar{\\bm{3}}_c$, $\\bar{\\bm{3}}_f$). Assuming that all the quarks are in an\n$S$-wave, the spin-0 tetraquark formed out of this scalar diquark has only one\nspin configuration, $|J,J_{12},J_{34}\\rangle=|000\\rangle$, where $J$ is the\nspin of the tetraquark, $J_{12}$ the diquark spin, $J_{34}$ the antidiquark\nspin. In this construction of the scalar tetraquark, we notice that another\ncompact diquark with spin-1 in ($\\bm{6}_c$, $\\bar{\\bm{3}}_f$) can be used\nalthough it is less compact than the scalar diquark. The spin-0 tetraquark\nconstructed from this vector diquark leads to the spin configuration\n$|J,J_{12},J_{34}\\rangle=|011\\rangle$. The two configurations, $|000\\rangle$\nand $|011\\rangle$, are found to mix strongly through the color-spin\ninteraction. The physical states can be identified with certain mixtures of the\ntwo configurations which diagonalize the hyperfine masses of the color-spin\ninteraction. Matching these states to two scalar resonances $a_0(980),\na_0(1450)$ or to $K^*_0(800), K^*_0(1430)$ depending on the isospin channel, we\nfind that their mass splittings are qualitatively consistent with the hyperfine\nmass splittings which can support their tetraquark structure. To test our\nmixing scheme further, we also construct the tetraquarks for $J=1,J=2$ with the\nspin configurations, $|111\\rangle$ and $|211\\rangle$, and discuss possible\ncandidates in the physical spectrum.\n", "  We present several studies of convolutional neural networks applied to data\ncoming from the MicroBooNE detector, a liquid argon time projection chamber\n(LArTPC). The algorithms studied include the classification of single particle\nimages, the localization of single particle and neutrino interactions in an\nimage, and the detection of a simulated neutrino event overlaid with cosmic ray\nbackgrounds taken from real detector data. These studies demonstrate the\npotential of convolutional neural networks for particle identification or event\ndetection on simulated neutrino interactions. We also address technical issues\nthat arise when applying this technique to data from a large LArTPC at or near\nground level.\n", "  We study the low-temperature charge transfer reaction between a neutral atom\nand an ion under the influence of near-resonant laser light. By setting up a\nmulti-channel model with field-dressed states we demonstrate that the reaction\nrate coefficient can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude with laser\nintensities of $10^6$ W/cm$^2$ or larger. In addition, depending on laser\nfrequency one can induce a significant enhancement or suppression of the\ncharge-exchange rate coefficient. For our intensities multi-photon processes\nare not important.\n", "  We discuss diphoton semi(exclusive) production in ultraperipheral $PbPb$\ncollisions at energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 5.5 TeV (LHC). The nuclear\ncalculations are based on equivalent photon approximation in the impact\nparameter space. The cross sections for elementary $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including three different mechanisms: box\ndiagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops, a VDM-Regge contribution with\nvirtual intermediate hadronic excitations of the photons and the two-gluon\nexchange contribution (formally three-loops). We got relatively high cross\nsections in $PbPb$ collisions. This opens a possibility to study the $\\gamma\n\\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ (quasi)elastic scattering at the LHC. We find that\nthe cross section for elastic $\\gamma\\gamma$ scattering could be measured in\nthe lead-lead collisions for the diphoton invariant mass up to\n$W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx 15-20$ GeV. We identify region(s) of phase space\nwhere the two-gluon exchange contribution becomes important ingredient compared\nto box and nonperturbative VDM-Regge mechanisms. We discuss also first results\nconcerning production of two $e^+ e^-$ pairs in UPCs of heavy ions. We\nconsidered only double scattering mechanism.\n", "  Even after decades of research the problem of first passage time statistics\nfor quantum dynamics remains a challenging topic of fundamental and practical\nimportance. Using a projective measurement approach, with a sampling time\n$\\tau$, we obtain the statistics of first detection events for quantum dynamics\non a lattice, with the detector located at the origin. A quantum renewal\nequation for a first detection wave function, in terms of which the first\ndetection probability can be calculated, is derived. This formula gives the\nrelation between first detection statistics and the solution of the\ncorresponding Schr\\\"odinger equation in the absence of measurement. We\ndemonstrate our results with tight binding quantum walk models. We examine a\nclosed system, i.e. a ring, and reveal the intricate influence of the sampling\ntime $\\tau$ on the statistics of detection, discussing the quantum Zeno effect,\nhalf dark states, revivals and optimal detection. The initial condition\nmodifies the statistics of a quantum walk on a finite ring in surprising ways.\nIn some cases the average detection time is independent of the sampling time\nwhile in others the average exhibits multiple divergences as the sampling time\nis modified. For an unbounded one dimensional quantum walk the probability of\nfirst detection decays like $(\\mbox{time})^{(-3)}$ with superimposed\noscillations, with exceptional behavior when the sampling period $\\tau$ times\nthe tunnelling rate $\\gamma$ is a multiple of $\\pi/2$. The amplitude of the\npower law decay is suppressed as $\\tau\\to 0$ due to the Zeno effect. Our work\npresented here, is an extended version of Friedman et al. arXiv:1603.02046\n[cond-mat.stat-mech], and it predicts rich physical behaviors compared with\nclassical Brownian motion, for which the first passage probability density\ndecays monotonically like $(\\mbox{time})^{-3/2}$, as elucidated by\nSchr\\\"odinger in $1915$.\n", "  \\noindent We revisit the \\textit{minimal seesaw model}, i.e., the type-I\nseesaw mechanism involving only two right-handed neutrinos. % This model\nrepresents an important minimal benchmark scenario for future experimental\nupdates on neutrino oscillations. % It features four real parameters that\ncannot be fixed by the current data: two $CP$-violating phases, $\\delta$ and\n$\\sigma$, as well as one complex parameter, $z$, that is experimentally\ninaccessible at low energies. % The parameter $z$ controls the structure of the\nneutrino Yukawa matrix at high energies, which is why it may be regarded as a\nlabel or index for all UV completions of the minimal seesaw model. % The fact\nthat $z$ encompasses only two real degrees of freedom allows us to\nsystematically scan the minimal seesaw model over all of its possible UV\ncompletions. % In doing so, we address the following question: Suppose $\\delta$\nand $\\sigma$ should be measured at particular values in the future---to what\nextent is one then still able to realize approximate textures in the neutrino\nYukawa matrix? % Our analysis, thus, generalizes previous studies of the\nminimal seesaw model based on the assumption of exact texture zeros. % In\nparticular, our study allows us to assess the theoretical uncertainty inherent\nto the common texture ansatz. % One of our main results is that a normal\nlight-neutrino mass hierarchy is, in fact, still consistent with a two-zero\nYukawa texture, provided that the two texture zeros receive corrections at the\nlevel of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\textrm{10}\\,\\%\\right)$. % While our numerical\nresults pertain to the minimal seesaw model only, our general procedure appears\nto be applicable to other neutrino mass models as well.\n", "  A new projection type imaging system is presented. The system can directly\nimage the field emission site distribution on a cathode surface by making use\nof anode screens in the standard parallel plate configuration. The lateral\nspatial resolution of the imager is between 1 and 10 {\\mu}m. The imaging\nsensitivity to the field emission current can be better than the current\nsensitivity of a typical electrometer, i.e. less than 1 nA.\n", "  A number of studies have considered how the rate of magnetic reconnection\nscales in large and weakly collisional systems by the modelling of long\nreconnecting current sheets. However, this set-up neglects both the formation\nof the current sheet and the coupling between the diffusion region and a larger\nsystem that supplies the magnetic flux. Recent studies of magnetic island\nmerging, which naturally include these features, have found that ion kinetic\nphysics is crucial to describe the reconnection rate and global evolution of\nsuch systems. In this paper, the effect of a guide field on reconnection during\nisland merging is considered. In contrast to the earlier current sheet studies,\nwe identify a limited range of guide fields for which the reconnection rate,\noutflow velocity, and pile-up magnetic field increase in magnitude as the guide\nfield increases. The Hall-MHD fluid model is found to reproduce kinetic\nreconnection rates only for a sufficiently strong guide field, for which ion\ninertia breaks the frozen-in condition and the outflow becomes Alfvenic in the\nkinetic system. The merging of large islands occurs on a longer timescale in\nthe zero guide field limit, which may in part be due to a mirror-like\ninstability that occurs upstream of the reconnection region.\n", "  The H-dibaryon (uuddss) is studied in holographic QCD for the first time. In\nholographic QCD, four-dimensional QCD, i.e., SU($N_c$) gauge theory with chiral\nquarks, can be formulated with $S^1$-compactified D4/D8/$\\overline{\\rm\nD8}$-brane system. In holographic QCD with large $N_c$, all the baryons appear\nas topological chiral solitons of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and (axial) vector\nmesons, and the H-dibaryon can be described as an SO(3)-type topological\nsoliton with $B=2$. We derive the low-energy effective theory to describe the\nH-dibaryon in holographic QCD. The H-dibaryon mass is found to be twice of the\n$B=1$ hedgehog-baryon mass, $M_{\\rm H} \\simeq 2.00 M_{B=1}^{\\rm HH}$, and is\nestimated about 1.7GeV, which is smaller than mass of two nucleons\n(flavor-octet baryons), in the chiral limit.\n", "  The QCD phase diagram at finite temperature and density has attracted\nconsiderable interest over many decades now, not least because of its relevance\nfor a better understanding of heavy-ion collision experiments. Models provide\nsome insight into the QCD phase structure but usually rely on various\nparameters. Based on renormalization group arguments, we discuss how the\nparameters of QCD low-energy models can be determined from the fundamental\ntheory of the strong interaction. We particularly focus on a determination of\nthe temperature dependence of these parameters in this work and comment on the\neffect of a finite quark chemical potential. We present first results and argue\nthat our findings can be used to improve the predictive power of future model\ncalculations.\n", "  Complex network approaches have been successfully applied for studying\ntransport processes in complex systems ranging from road, railway or airline\ninfrastructure over industrial manufacturing to fluid dynamics. Here, we\nutilize a generic framework for describing the dynamics of geophysical flows\nsuch as ocean currents or atmospheric wind fields in terms of Lagrangian flow\nnetworks. In this approach, information on the passive advection of particles\nis transformed into a Markov chain based on transition probabilities of\nparticles between the volume elements of a given partition of space for a fixed\ntime step. We employ perturbation-theoretic methods to investigate the effects\nof modifications of transport processes in the underlying flow for three\ndifferent problem classes: efficient absorption (corresponding to particle\ntrapping or leaking), constant input of particles (with additional source terms\nmodeling, e.g., localized contamination), and shifts of the steady state under\nprobability mass conservation (as arising if the background flow is perturbed\nitself). Our results demonstrate that in all three cases, changes to the steady\nstate solution can be analytically expressed in terms of the eigensystem of the\nunperturbed flow and the perturbation itself. These results are potentially\nrelevant for developing more efficient strategies for coping with\ncontaminations of fluid or gaseous media such as ocean and atmosphere by oil\nspills, radioactive substances, non-reactive chemicals or volcanic aerosols.\n", "  The conventional neutrino transport theory for core-collapse supernovae\nmisses one key property of neutrinos: the left-handedness. The chirality of\nneutrinos modifies the hydrodynamic behavior at the macroscopic scale and leads\nto topological transport phenomena. We argue that such transport phenomena\nshould play important roles in the evolution of core-collapse supernovae, and,\nin particular, lead to a tendency toward the inverse energy cascade from small\nto larger scales, which may be relevant to the origin of the supernova\nexplosion.\n", "  We present main elements of the construction of unintegrated double parton\ndistribution functions which depend on transverse momenta of partons. We follow\nthe method proposed by Kimber, Martin and Ryskin for a construction of\nunintegrated single parton distributions from the standard parton distribution\nfunctions.\n", "  Results for three-point functions of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory at\nnon-vanishing temperature are presented and compared to lattice results. It is\nfound that the three-gluon vertex is enhanced for temperatures below the phase\ntransition. At very low momenta it becomes negative for all temperatures.\nFurthermore, truncation effects in functional equations are discussed at the\nexample of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory for which a self-contained\nsolution is presented.\n", "  A hardening of the proton and helium fluxes is observed above a few hundreds\nof GeV/nuc. The distribution of local sources of primary cosmic rays has been\nsuggested as a potential solution to this puzzling behavior. Some authors even\nclaim that a single source is responsible for the observed anomalies. But how\nprobable these explanations are? To answer that question, our current\ndescription of cosmic ray Galactic propagation needs to be replaced by the\nMyriad model. In the former approach, sources of protons and helium nuclei are\ntreated as a jelly continuously spread over space and time. A more accurate\ndescription is provided by the Myriad model where sources are considered as\npoint-like events. This leads to a probabilistic derivation of the fluxes of\nprimary species, and opens the possibility that larger-than-average values may\nbe observed at the Earth. For a long time though, a major obstacle has been the\ninfinite variance associated to the probability distribution function which the\nfluxes follow. Several suggestions have been made to cure this problem but none\nis entirely satisfactory. We go a step further here and solve the infinite\nvariance problem of the Myriad model by making use of the generalized central\nlimit theorem. We find that primary fluxes are distributed according to a\nstable law with heavy tail, well-known to financial analysts. The probability\nthat the proton and helium anomalies are sourced by local SNR can then be\ncalculated. The p-values associated to the CREAM measurements turn out to be\nsmall, unless somewhat unrealistic propagation parameters are assumed.\n", "  We investigate whether NLO BFKL evolution is capable to describe the energy\ndependence of the exclusive photo-production cross-section of vector mesons\n$J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ on protons. Our description is based on available NLO\nBFKL fits of the proton impact factor in inclusive DIS, which allow us to\nconstruct the necessary scattering amplitude at zero momentum transfer $t=0$.\nAssuming an exponential drop-off with $t$, this result allows us to calculate\nthe exclusive photoproduction cross-section. Comparing our results with both\nHERA data (measured by H1 and ZEUS collaborations in $ep$ collision) and LHC\ndata (measured by ALICE, CMS and LHCb collaborations in ultra-peripheral $pp$\nand $pPb$ collision) we find that our framework provides a very good\ndescription of the energy dependence of the $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$\nphotoproduction cross-section, providing therefore further evidence for BFKL\nevolution at the LHC. The available fits of the proton impact factor require on\nthe other hand an adjustment in the overall normalization.\n", "  We present a three-dimensional model, based on cohesive spherical particles,\nof rain-induced landslides. The rainwater infiltration into the soil follow the\neither the fractional or the fractal diffusion equations. We solve analytically\nthe fractal diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) with particular\nboundary conditions to simulate a rainfall event. Then, for the PDE, we\ndeveloped a numerical integration scheme that we integrate with MD (Molecular\nDynamics) algorithm for the triggering and propagation of the simulated\nlandslide. Therefore we test the numerical integration scheme of fractal\ndiffusion equation with the analytical solution. We adopt the fractal diffusion\nequation in term of gravimetric water content that we use as input of\ntriggering scheme based on Mohr-Coulomb limit-equilibrium criterion, adapted to\nparticle level. Moreover, taking into account an interacting force\nLennard-Jones inspired, we use a standard MD algorithm to update particle\npositions and velocities. Then we present results for homogeneous and\nheterogeneous systems (i.e. composed by particles with same or different radius\nrespectively). Interestingly, in the heterogeneous case, we observe segregation\neffects due to the different volume of the particles. Finally we show the\nparameter sensibility analysis both for triggering and propagation phase. Our\nsimulations confirm the results of our previous two-dimensional model and\ntherefore the feasible applicability to real cases.\n", "  The operation of organic optoelectronic devices relies notably on the bulk\nproperties of compound molecular species, but even more so on the influence of\ninterfaces thereof. The identification and characterization of elemental\nprocesses in these critical sections of a device thereby requires well-defined\ninterfaces with low defect density. In this context titanyl phthalocyanine\n(TiOPc) arises as an excellent candidate that reveals the formation of a stable\nbilayer structure with a characteristic \"up-down\" molecular arrangement that\noptimizes the dipole-dipole interaction within the bilayer. In our experimental\nstudy, long-range ordered TiOPc bilayers have been grown on Ag(111) surfaces\nand analyzed using infrared absorption spectroscopy and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy. By monitoring the prominent Ti=O stretching mode in IRAS and\nidentifying local configurations in STM, a microscopic model for the growth of\nTiOPc bilayers on Ag(111) is suggested. We demonstrate that defect structures\nwithin these bilayers lead to characteristic vibrational signatures which react\nsensitively to the local environment of the molecules. Thermal desorption\nspectroscopy reveals a high thermal stability of the TiOPc bilayer up to 500 K,\nwhich is attributed to hydrogen bonds between oxygen of the titanyl unit and\nthe hydrogen rim of phthalocyanines in the second layer, in addition to\ncontributions arising from the oppositely oriented axial dipole moments and the\nubiquitous van der Waals interactions.\n", "  In this short presentation I emphasize the increased importance of kaon\nflavour physics in the search for new physics (NP) that we should witness in\nthe rest of this decade and in the next decade. The main actors will be the\nbranching ratios for the rare decays $K^+\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and\n$K_{L}\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$, to be measured by NA62 and KOTO, and their\ncorrelations with the ratio $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ on which recently\nprogress by lattice QCD and large $N$ dual QCD approach has been made implying\na new flavour anomaly. Further correlations of $K^+\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$,\n$K_{L}\\rightarrow\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ with\n$\\varepsilon_K$, $\\Delta M_K$, $K_L\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$\nwill help us to identify indirectly possible NP at short distance scales. This\ntalk summarizes the present highlights of this fascinating field including some\nresults from concrete NP scenarios.\n", "  We study the dependence of the chiral condensate on external magnetic field\nin the context of holographic QCD at large number of flavors. We consider a\nholographic QCD model where the flavor degrees of freedom fully backreact on\nthe color dynamics. Perturbative QCD calculations have shown that $B$ acts\nconstructively on the chiral condensate, a phenomenon called \"magnetic\ncatalysis\". In contrast, recent lattice calculations show that, depending on\nthe number of flavors and temperature, the magnetic field may also act\ndestructively, which is called \"inverse magnetic catalysis\". Here we show that\nthe holographic theory is capable of both behaviors depending on the choice of\nparameters. For reasonable choice of the potentials entering the model we find\nqualitative agreement with the lattice expectations. Our results provide\ninsight for the physical reasons behind the inverse magnetic catalysis. In\nparticular, we argue that the backreaction of the flavors to the background\ngeometry decatalyzes the condensate.\n", "  A many-body Wannier-Stark system coupled to an effective reservoir is studied\nwithin a non-Hermitian approach in the presence of a periodic driving. We show\nhow the interplay of dissipation and driving dynamically induces a subspace of\nstates which are very robust against dissipation. We numerically probe the\nstructure of these asymptotic states and their robustness to imperfections in\nthe initial-state preparation and to the size of the system. Moreover, the\nasymptotic states are found to be strongly entangled making them interesting\nfor further applications.\n", "  An approximate rotational symmetry of a heavy-light meson is viewed from a\nstring picture. Using a simple string configuration, we derive a formula,\n$(M-m_c)^2=\\pi\\sigma L$, whose coefficient of the r.h.s. is just 1/2 of that of\na light meson with two light quarks. A numerical plot is obtained for $D$\nmesons of experimental data as well as several theoretical models, which shows\ngood agreement with this formula.\n", "  We have developed a code that semi-analytically calculates the radio\nfootprint (intensity and polarization) of an extensive air shower subject to\natmospheric electric fields. This can be used to reconstruct the height\ndependence of atmospheric electric field from the measured radio footprint. The\nvarious parameterizations of the spatial extent of the induced currents are\nbased on the results of Monte-Carlo shower simulations. The calculated radio\nfootprints agree well with microscopic CoREAS simulations.\n", "  We report here on recent progress in the determination of S-wave and P-wave\nheavy-quarkonium states at finite temperature. Our results are based on the\ncombination of effective field theories with numerical lattice QCD simulations.\nThese non-perturbative tools allow us to compute the heavy-quarkonium in-medium\nspectral functions, from which we in turn determine the melting temperatures of\nindividual states and estimate phenomenologically relevant observables, such as\nthe $\\psi^\\prime$ to J/$\\psi$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an essential nanoinstrument technique for\nseveral applications such as cell biology and nanoelectronics metrology and\ninspection. The need for statistically significant sample sizes means that data\ncollection can be an extremely lengthy process in AFM. The use of a single AFM\ninstrument is known for its very low speed and not being suitable for scanning\nlarge areas, resulting in very-low-throughput measurement. We address this\nchallenge by parallelizing AFM instruments. The parallelization is achieved by\nminiaturizing the AFM instrument and operating many of them simultaneously.\nThis nanoinstrument has the advantages that each miniaturized AFM can be\noperated independently and that the advances in the field of AFM, both in terms\nof speed and imaging modalities, can be implemented more easily. Moreover, a\nparallel AFM instrument also allows one to measure several physical parameters\nsimultaneously; while one instrument measures nano-scale topography, another\ninstrument can measure mechanical, electrical or thermal properties, making it\na Lab-on-an-Instrument. In this paper, a proof of principle (PoP) of such a\nparallel AFM instrument has been demonstrated by analyzing the topography of\nlarge samples such as semiconductor wafers. This nanoinstrument provides new\nresearch opportunities in the nanometrology of wafers and nanolithography masks\nby enabling real die-to-die and wafer-level measurements and in cell biology by\nmeasuring the nano-scale properties of a large number of cells.\n", "  We analyse the aging dynamics of the H\\'ebraud-Lequeux model, a\nself-consistent stochastic model for the evolution of local stress in an\namorphous material. We show that the model exhibits initial-condition dependent\nfreezing: the stress diffusion constant decays with time as $D\\sim 1/t^2$\nduring aging so that the cumulative amount of memory that can be erased, which\nis given by the time integral of $D(t)$, is finite. Accordingly the shear\nstress relaxation function, which we determine in the long-time regime, only\ndecays to a plateau and becomes progressively elastic as the system ages. The\nfrequency-dependent shear modulus exhibits a corresponding overall decay of the\ndissipative part with system age, while the characteristic relaxation times\nscale linearly with age as expected.\n", "  We study the dynamics and topology of an emerging magnetic flux concentration\nusing high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric data acquired with the\nImaging Magnetograph eXperiment on board the Sunrise balloon-borne solar\nobservatory. We obtain the full vector magnetic field and the line-of-sight\n(LOS) velocity through inversions of the Fe I line at 525.02 nm with the SPINOR\ncode. The derived vector magnetic field is used to trace magnetic field lines.\nTwo magnetic flux concentrations with different polarity and LOS velocities are\nfound to be connected by a group of arch-shaped magnetic field lines. The\npositive polarity footpoint is weaker (1100 G) and displays an upflow, while\nthe negative polarity footpoint is stronger (2200 G) and shows a downflow. This\nconfiguration is naturally interpreted as a siphon flow along an arched\nmagnetic flux tube.\n", "  Extracting automatically the complex set of features composing real\nhigh-dimensional data is crucial for achieving high performance in\nmachine--learning tasks. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are empirically\nknown to be efficient for this purpose, and to be able to generate distributed\nand graded representations of the data. We characterize the structural\nconditions (sparsity of the weights, low effective temperature, nonlinearities\nin the activation functions of hidden units, and adaptation of fields\nmaintaining the activity in the visible layer) allowing RBM to operate in such\na compositional phase. Evidence is provided by the replica analysis of an\nadequate statistical ensemble of random RBMs and by RBM trained on the\nhandwritten digits dataset MNIST.\n", "  The quantum statistical parton distributions approach proposed more than one\ndecade ago is revisited by considering a larger set of recent and accurate Deep\nInelastic Scattering experimental results. It enables us to improve the\ndescription of the data by means of a new determination of the parton\ndistributions. This global next-to-leading order QCD analysis leads to a good\ndescription of several structure functions, involving unpolarized parton\ndistributions and helicity distributions, in a broad range of $x$ and $Q^2$ and\nin terms of a rather small number of free parameters. There are several\nchallenging issues, in particular the behavior of $\\bar d(x) / \\bar u(x)$ at\nlarge $x$, a possible large positive gluon helicity distribution, etc.. The\npredictions of this theoretical approach will be tested for single-jet\nproduction and charge asymmetry in $W^{\\pm}$ production in $\\bar p p$ and $p p$\ncollisions up to LHC energies, using recent data and also for forthcoming\nexperimental results.\n", "  A novel room-temperature ion source for the production of atomic ions in\nelectron beam within wide ranges of electron energy and current density is\ndeveloped. The device can operate both as conventional Electron Beam Ion\nSource/Trap (EBIS/T) and novel Main Magnetic Focus Ion Source. The ion source\nis suitable for generation of the low-, medium- and high-density microplasma in\nsteady state, which can be employed for investigation of a wide range of\nphysical problems in ordinary university laboratory, in particular, for\nmicroplasma simulations relevant to astrophysics and ITER reactor. For the\nelectron beam characterized by the incident energy $E_e = 10$ keV, the current\ndensity $j_e \\sim 20$ kA/cm$^2$ and the number density $n_e \\sim 2 \\times\n10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ were achieved experimentally. For $E_e \\sim 60$ keV, the\nvalue of electron number density $n_e \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ is feasible. The\nefficiency of the novel ion source for laboratory astrophysics significantly\nexceeds that of other existing warm and superconducting EBITs. A problem of the\nK-shell electron ionization of heavy and superheavy elements is also discussed.\n", "  Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids, Miras, and RR Lyrae stars, are important\ndistance indicators and calibrators of the \"cosmic distance ladder\", and yet\ntheir period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations are still constrained using\nsimple statistical methods that cannot take full advantage of available data.\nTo enable optimal usage of data provided by the Gaia mission, we present a\nprobabilistic approach that simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ\nrelations and uncertainties in Gaia parallax measurements. We demonstrate this\napproach by constraining PLZ relations of type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars in\nnear-infrared W1 and W2 bands, using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)\nparallax measurements for a sample of $\\approx100$ type $ab$ RR Lyrae stars\nlocated within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are consistent with\nprevious studies, and in combination with other data, deliver distances precise\nto 6% (once various sources of uncertainty are taken into account). To a\nprecision of 0.05 mas ($1\\sigma$), we do not find a statistically significant\noffset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant RR Lyrae stars (median\nparallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4 kpc). With only minor modifications,\nour probabilistic approach can be used to constrain PLZ relations of other\npulsating stars, and we intend to apply it to Cepheid and Mira stars in the\nnear future.\n", "  Short range particle repulsion is rather important property of the hadronic\nand nuclear matter equations of state. We present a novel equation of state\nwhich is based on the virial expansion for the multicomponent mixtures with\nhard-core repulsion. In addition to the hard-core repulsion taken into account\nby the proper volumes of particles, this equation of state explicitly contains\nthe surface tension which is induced by another part of the hard-core repulsion\nbetween particles. At high densities the induced surface tension vanishes and\nthe excluded volume treatment of hard-core repulsion is switched to its proper\nvolume treatment. Possible applications of this equation of state to a\ndescription of hadronic multiplicities measured in A+A collisions, to an\ninvestigation of the nuclear matter phase diagram properties and to the neutron\nstar interior modeling are discussed.\n", "  Subdiffusion with reaction $A+B\\rightarrow B$ is considered in a system which\nconsists of two homogeneous media joined together; the $A$ particles are mobile\nwhereas $B$ are static. Subdiffusion and reaction parameters, which are assumed\nto be independent of time and space variable, can be different in both media.\nParticles $A$ move freely across the border between the media. In each part of\nthe system the process is described by the subdiffusion--reaction equations\nwith fractional time derivative. By means of the method presented in this paper\nwe derive both the fundamental solutions (the Green's functions) $P(x,t)$ to\nthe subdiffusion--reaction equations and the boundary conditions at the border\nbetween the media. One of the conditions demands the continuity of a flux and\nthe other one contains the Riemann--Liouville fractional time derivatives\n$\\partial^{\\alpha_1}P(0^+,t)/\\partial\nt^{\\alpha_1}=(D_1/D_2)\\partial^{\\alpha_2}P(0^-,t)/\\partial t^{\\alpha_2}$, where\nthe subdiffusion parameters $\\alpha_1$, $D_1$ and $\\alpha_2$, $D_2$ are defined\nin the regions $x<0$ and $x>0$, respectively.\n", "  Recently, quadrupole helix chirality and its domain structure was observed in\nresonant x-ray diffraction experiments on DyFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ using circularly\npolarized x rays [T. Usui et al., Nature Materials 13, 611 (2014)]. We show\nthat this effect can be explained quantitatively by calculating the quadrupole\nmoments of the Dy$^{3+}$ ions induced by the low-symmetry ($C_2$) crystal-field\n(CF) component. In this work, the CF parameters for the Dy$^{3+}$ ions in the\n$P3_121$ ($P3_221$) phase of DyFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ are obtained from CF\ncalculations based on the analysis of high-resolution temperature-dependent\noptical spectroscopy data. We also consider the helix chirality of the\nsingle-site magnetic susceptibility tensors of the Dy$^{3+}$ ions in the\nparamagnetic $P3_121$ ($P3_221$) phase and suggest a neutron diffraction\nexperiment to reveal it.\n", "  Combining theory with experiments, we study the phase stability, elastic\nproperties, electronic structure and hardness of layered ternary borides\nAlCr2B2, AlMn2B2, AlFe2B2, AlCo2B2, and AlNi2B2. We find that the first three\nborides of this series are stable phases, while AlCo2B2 and AlNi2B2 are\nmetastable. We show that the elasticity increases in the boride series, and\npredict that AlCr2B2, AlMn2B2, and AlFe2B2 are more brittle, while AlCo2B2 and\nAlNi2B2 are more ductile. We propose that the elasticity of AlFe2B2 can be\nimproved by alloying it with cobalt or nickel, or a combination of them. We\npresent evidence that these ternary borides represent nanolaminated systems.\nBased on SEM measurements, we demonstrate that they exhibit the delamination\nphenomena, which leads to a reduced hardness compared to transition metal mono-\nand diborides. We discuss the background of delamination by analyzing chemical\nbonding and theoretical work of separation in these borides.\n", "  In the quest for an effective field theory which could help to understand\nsome non perturbative feature of the QCD in the Regge limit, we consider a\nReggeon Field Theory (RFT) for both Pomeron and Odderon interactions and\nperform an analysys of the critical theory using functional renormalization\ngroup techniques, unveiling a novel symmetry structure.\n", "  We derive asymptotic freedom and the $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills $\\beta$-function\nusing the renormalization group procedure for effective particles. In this\nprocedure, the concept of effective particles of size $s$ is introduced.\nEffective particles in the Fock space build eigenstates of the effective\nHamiltonian $H_s$, which is a matrix written in a basis that depend on the\nscale (or size) parameter $s$. The effective Hamiltonians $H_s$ and the\n(regularized) canonical Hamiltonian $H_{0}$ are related by a similarity\ntransformation. We calculate the effective Hamiltonian by solving its\nrenormalization-group equation perturbatively up to third order and calculate\nthe running coupling from the three-gluon-vertex function in the effective\nHamiltonian operator.\n", "  In biological membranes, alpha-tocopherols ({\\alpha}-toc; vitamin E) protect\npolyunsaturated lipids from free radicals. Although the interactions of\n{\\alpha}-toc with non-oxidized lipid bilayers have been studied, their on\noxidized bilayers remain unknown. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations of oxidized lipid bilayers were performed with varying\nconcentrations of {\\alpha}-toc. Bilayers with\n1-palmitoyl-2-lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC) lipids and its\naldehyde derivatives at 1:1 ratio were studied. Our simulations show that\noxidized lipids self-assemble into aggregates with a water pore rapidly\ndeveloping across the lipid bilayer. The free energy of transporting an\n{\\alpha}-toc molecule in a lipid bilayer suggests that {\\alpha}-tocs can\npassively adsorb into the bilayer. When {\\alpha}-toc molecules were present at\nlow concentrations in bilayers containing oxidized lipids, the formation of\nwater pores was slowed down. At high {\\alpha}-toc concentra-tions, no pores\nwere observed. Based on the simulations, we propose that the mechanism of how\n{\\alpha}-toc inhibits pore formation in bilayers with oxidized lipids is the\nfollow-ing: {\\alpha}-tocs trap the polar groups of the oxidized lipids at the\nmembrane-water interface resulting in a decreased probability for the oxidized\nlipids to reach contact with the two leaflets and initiate pore formation. This\ndemon-strates that {\\alpha}-toc molecules not only protect the bilayer from\noxidation but also help to stabilize the bilayer after lipid peroxidation\noccurs. These results will help in de-signing more efficient molecules to\nprotect membranes from oxidative stress.\n", "  V-QCD is a class of effective holographic models for QCD which fully includes\nthe backreaction of quarks to gluon dynamics. The physics of the theta-angle\nand the axial anomaly can be consistently included in these models. We analyze\ntheir phase diagrams over ranges of values of the quark mass, N_f/N_c, and\ntheta, computing observables such as the topological susceptibility and the\nmeson masses. At small quark mass, where effective chiral Lagrangians are\nreliable, they agree with the predictions of V-QCD.\n", "  We present a new method to compute higher-order corrections to physical\ncross-sections, at Next-to-Leading Order and beyond. This method, based on the\nLoop Tree Duality, leads to locally integrable expressions in four dimensions.\nBy introducing a physically motivated momentum mapping between the momenta\ninvolved in the real and the virtual contributions, infrared singularities\nnaturally cancel at integrand level, without the need to introduce subtraction\ncounter-terms. Ultraviolet singularities are dealt with by using dual\nrepresentations of suitable counter-terms, with some subtleties regarding the\nself-energy contributions. As an example, we apply this method to compute the\n$1\\to2$ decay rate in the context of a scalar toy model with massive particles.\n", "  The classical thermostatics of equilibrium processes is shown to possess a\nquantum-mechanical dual theory with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of\nquantum states. Specifically, the kernel of a certain Hamiltonian operator\nbecomes the Hilbert space of quasistatic quantum mechanics. The relation of\nthermostatics to topological field theory is also discussed in the context of\nthe emergent approach to quantum theory, where the concept of entropy plays a\nkey role.\n", "  Leading neutron production on protons is known to be subject to strong\nabsorptive corrections, which have been under debate for a long time. On\nnuclear targets these corrections are significantly enhanced and push the\npartial cross sections of neutron production to the very periphery of the\nnucleus. As a result, the A-dependences of inclusive and diffractive neutron\nproduction turn out to be similar. The mechanism of \\pi-a_1 interference, which\nsuccessfully explained the observed single-spin asymmetry of neutrons in\npolarized pp interactions, is extended here to polarized pA collisions.\nCorrected for nuclear effects it explains well the magnitude and sign of the\nasymmetry A_N observed in inelastic events, resulting in a violent break up of\nthe nucleus. However the excessive magnitude of A_N observed in the diffractive\nsample, remains a challenge.\n", "  We discuss recent advances on QCD chiral symmetry restoration at finite\ntemperature, within the theoretical framework of Effective Theories. $U(3)$\nWard Identities are derived between pseudoscalar susceptibilities and quark\ncondensates, allowing to explain the behaviour of lattice meson screening\nmasses. Unitarized interactions and the generated $f_0(500)$ thermal state are\nshowed to play an essential role in the description of the transition through\nthe scalar susceptibility\n", "  Carrier and spin recombination are investigated in p-type GaAs of acceptor\nconcentration NA = 1.5 x 10^(17) cm^(-3) using time-resolved photoluminescence\nspectroscopy at 15 K. At low pho- tocarrier concentration, acceptors are mostly\nneutral and photoelectrons can either recombine with holes bound to acceptors\n(e-A0 line) or form excitons which are mostly trapped on neutral acceptors\nforming the (A0X) complex. It is found that the spin lifetime is shorter for\nelectrons that recombine through the e-A0 transition due to spin relaxation\ngenerated by the exchange scattering of free electrons with either trapped or\nfree holes, whereas spin flip processes are less likely to occur once the\nelectron forms with a free hole an exciton bound to a neutral acceptor. An\nincrease of exci- tation power induces a cross-over to a regime where the\nbimolecular band-to-band (b-b) emission becomes more favorable due to screening\nof the electron-hole Coulomb interaction and ionization of excitonic complexes\nand free excitons. Then, the formation of excitons is no longer possible, the\ncarrier recombination lifetime increases and the spin lifetime is found to\ndecrease dramatically with concentration due to fast spin relaxation with free\nphotoholes. In this high density regime, both the electrons that recombine\nthrough the e-A0 transition and through the b-b transition have the same spin\nrelaxation time.\n", "  The CMS-TOTEM Precision Proton Spectrometer (CT-PPS) is an approved project\nto add tracking and timing information at approximately $\\pm$210~m from the\ninteraction point around the CMS detector. It is designed to operate at high\nluminosity with up to 50 interactions per 25~ns bunch crossing to perform\nmeasurements of e.g. the quartic gauge couplings and search for rare exclusive\nprocesses. During 2016, CT-PPS took data in normal high-luminosity\nproton-proton LHC collisions. In the coming years, high radiation doses and\nlarge multiple-vertex interactions will represent difficult challenges that\nresemble those of the high-luminosity LHC program. A coordinated effort of\ndetector upgrades with the goal of reaching the physics goals while mitigating\nthe degradation effects is under way. Upgrades to the tracking and timing\ndetectors are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate multi-soft behaviors of tree amplitudes in\nnonlinear sigma model (NLSM). The leading behaviors of amplitudes with odd\nnumber of all-adjacent soft pions are zero. We further propose and prove that\nleading soft factors of amplitudes with even number all-adjacent soft pions can\nbe expressed in terms of products of the leading order Berends-Giele\nsub-currents in Cayley parametrization. Each sub-current in the expression\ncontains at most one hard pion. Discussions are generalized to amplitudes\ncontaining arbitrary number of nonadjacent soft blocks: The leading behaviors\nof amplitudes where at least one soft block has odd number of adjacent soft\npions are zero; The leading soft factors for amplitudes where all soft blocks\ncontaining even number of soft pions are given by products of soft factors for\nthese blocks.\n", "  Photoelectron emission microscopy PEEM is a powerful tool to\nspectroscopically image dynamic surface processes at the nanoscale but is\ntraditionally limited to ultra high or moderate vacuum conditions. Here, we\ndevelop a novel grapheme capped multichannel array sample platform that extends\nthe capabilities of photoelectron spectromicroscopy to routine liquid and\natmospheric pressure studies with standard PEEM setups. Using this platform, we\nshow that graphene has only a minor influence on the electronic structure of\nwater in the first few layers and thus will allow for the examination of\nminimally perturbed aqueous phase interfacial dynamics. Analogous to microarray\nscreening technology in biomedical research, our platform is highly suitable\nfor applications in tandem with large-scale data mining, pattern recognition,\nand combinatorial methods for spectro temporal and spatiotemporal analyses at\nsolid liquid interfaces. Using Bayesian linear unmixing algorithm, we were able\nto discriminate between different X-ray induced water radiolysis scenarios and\nobserve a metastable wetting intermediate water layer during the late stages of\nbubble formationformation\n", "  A full understanding of the spacetime evolution of the QCD matter created in\na heavy ion collision requires understanding the properties of the initial\nstages. In the weak coupling picture these are dominated by classical gluon\nfields, whose properties can also be studied via the scattering of dilute\nprobes off a high energy hadron or nucleus. A particular challenge is\nunderstanding small systems, where LHC data is also showing signs of collective\nbehavior. We discuss some recent results of on the initial matter production\nand thermalization in heavy ion collisions, in particular in the gluon\nsaturation framework.\n", "  E+A galaxies are post-starburst systems that are identified from their\noptical spectra. These galaxies contain a substantial young A-type stellar\ncomponent, but have only little ongoing star formation (SF). HI 21-cm line\nemission is found in approximately half of the nearby E+A galaxies, indicating\nthat they contain a reservoir of gas that could fuel active SF. Here, we study\ntwo HI-rich galaxies, which show a typical E+A spectrum at the centre and SF at\nlarger radii. We present new high spatial resolution radio interferometric\nobservations of the HI 21-cm emission line using the VLA and of the CO(1-0)\nemission line using ALMA. We combine these data sets to predict the SFR and\nshow that it does not correlate well with the SFR derived from H alpha on\nsub-kpc scales. We apply a recently developed statistical model for the small\nscale behaviour of the SF relation to predict and interpret the observed\nscatter. We find smoothly distributed, regularly rotating HI gas. The CO(1-0)\nemission line is not detected for both galaxies. The derived upper limit on the\nCO mass implies a molecular gas depletion time shorter than 20 Myr. However,\ndue to the low metallicity, the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is highly uncertain.\nIn the relations between the H alpha-based SFR and the HI mass, we observe a\nsubstantial scatter we demonstrate results from small-number statistics of\nindependent star-forming regions on sub-kpc scales. This finding adds to the\nexisting literature reporting a scale dependence of the molecular SF relation,\nshowing that the atomic and molecular phases are both susceptible to the\nevolutionary 'cycling' of individual regions. This suggests that the atomic gas\nreservoirs host substantial substructure, which should be observable with\nfuture high-resolution observations. (abridged)\n", "  The Dotsenko-Fateev integral is an analytic function of one complex variable\nexpressing the amplitude in the 4-point correlator of the 2D conformal field\ntheory. Dotsenko-Fateev found ODE of third order with Fuchsian singularities\nsatisfied by their integral. In the present paper, this work is extended to\ngeneralized Dotsenko-Fateev integrals, in particular those associated to\narbitrary multipoint correlators, and Pfaff systems of PDE of Fuchsian type are\nconstructed for them. The ubiquity of the Fuchsian systems is in that they\npermit to obtain local expansions of solutions in the neighborhoods of\nsingularities of the system.\n", "  We study lattice QCD with $N_f=2$ Wilson fermions at nonzero imaginary\nchemical potential and nonzero temperature. We relate the Roberge - Weiss phase\ntransition to the properties of dyons which are constituents of the KvBLL\ncalorons. We present numerical evidence that the characteristic features of the\nspectral gap of the overlap Dirac operator as function of an angle modifying\nthe boundary condition are determined by the $Z_3$ sector of the respective\nimaginary chemical potential. We then demonstrate that dyon excitations in\nthermal configurations could be responsible (in line with perturbative\nexcitations) for these phenomena.\n", "  Adiabatic invariants are introduced and shown to provide an approximate\nsecond integral of motion for the non-integrable Dicke model, in the energy\nregion where the system exhibits a regular dynamics. This low-energy region is\nalways present and has been described both in a semiclassical and a full\nquantum analysis. Its Peres lattices exhibit that many observables vary\nsmoothly with energy, along lines which beg for a formal description. It is\nshown how the adiabatic invariants provide a rationale to their presence in\nmany cases. They are built employing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, valid\nwhen a fast system is coupled to a much slower one. As the Dicke model has a\none bosonic and one fermionic degree of freedom, two versions of the\napproximation are used, depending on which one is the faster. In both cases a\nnoticeably accord with exact numerical results is obtained. The employment of\nthe adiabatic invariants provides a simple and clear theoretical framework to\nstudy the physical phenomenology associated to this energy regime, far beyond\nthe energies where the quadratic approximation can be employed.\n", "  R-modes of neutron stars could be a source of gravitational waves for ground\nbased detectors. If the precise frequency $\\sigma$ is known, guided\ngravitational wave searches with enhanced detectability are possible. Because\nof its physical importance many authors have calculated the r-mode frequency.\nFor the dominant mode, the associated gravitational wave frequency is 4/3 times\nthe angular velocity of the star $\\Omega$, subject to various corrections of\nwhich relativistic and rotational corrections are the most important. This has\nled several authors to investigate the dependence of the r-mode frequency on\nfactors such as the relativistic compactness parameter ($M/R$) and the angular\nvelocity of stars with different equations of state. The results found so far,\nhowever, are almost independent of the equation of state. Here we investigate\nthe effect of rapid rotation and differential rotation on $\\sigma$. We evolve\nthe perturbation equations using the Cowling approximation by applying finite\ndifferencing methods to compute the r-mode frequency for a series of rotating\nneutron stars with polytropic equations of state. We find that rotational\neffects in the r-mode frequency can be larger than relativistic effects for\nrapidly spinning stars with low compactness, reducing the observed frequency.\nDifferential rotation also acts to decrease $\\sigma$, but its effect inscreases\nwith the compactness. The results presented here are relevant to the design of\ngravitational wave and electromagnetic r-mode searches.\n", "  A kinematically complete measurement of the four-body breakup reaction\nd+2H-->2ps+2ns --> p +p +n +n has been performed at 15 MeV deuteron beam of the\nSINP MSU. The two protons and neutron were detected at angles close to those of\nemission of 2ps and 2ns systems. The energy of singlet dineutron state was\ndetermined by comparing experimental TOF spectrum of breakup neutrons with\nsimulated spectra depending on this energy. A low value Enn = 0.076 +/- 0.006\nkeV obtained by fitting procedure apparently indicates an effective enhancement\nof nn-interaction in the intermediate state of studied reaction.\n", "  Measuring the rate at which the long-lived, neutral kaon decays into a\nneutral pion, neutrino, and anti-neutrino allows physicists an opportunity to\ntest precise predictions made by the Standard Model. Differences between\ntheoretical predictions and experimental measurements may point to new physics.\nNot only does the Standard Model predict a very low probability at\napproximately 3 $K_L \\to \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ decays in 100 billion $K_L$\ndecays, but many of the common decays leave false signals in the detector that\nlook the same as the true signal. Charged decays have been studied to determine\nthe required detection efficiency necessary to eliminate them. The conclusion\nof these studies is that a reduction by a factor of $1/(3\\times10^9)$ will be\nrequired to achieve the 10:1 signal to charged background ratio necessary for\nthe experiment.\n", "  We propose and study the photoproduction of a $\\gamma\\,\\rho$ pair with a\nlarge invariant mass and a small transverse momentum of the final nucleon, as a\nway to access generalized parton distributions. In the kinematics of JLab\n12-GeV, we demonstrate the feasibility of this measurement.\n", "  Relying on the shockwave approach, we present the main steps of the\ncomputation of the impact factor for the exclusive diffractive photo- or\nelectro- production of a forward dijet with NLO accuracy. We provide details of\nthe cancellation mechanisms for all the divergences which appear in the\nintermediate results.\n", "  The holographic Weyl semimetal is a model of a strongly coupled topological\nsemi-metal. A topological quantum phase transition separates a topological\nphase with non-vanishing anomalous Hall conductivity from a trivial state. We\ninvestigate how this phase transition depends on the parameters of the scalar\npotential (mass and quartic self coupling) finding that the quantum phase\ntransition persists for a large region in parameter space. We then compute the\naxial Hall conductivity. The algebraic structure of the axial anomaly predicts\nit to be 1/3 of the electric Hall conductivity. We find that this holds once a\nnon-trivial renormalization effect on the external axial gauge fields is taken\ninto account. Finally we show that the phase transition also occurs in a\ntop-down model based on a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity.\n", "  The consequences of discrete particle noise for a system possessing a\npossibly unstable collective mode are discussed. It is argued that a\nzonostrophic instability (of homogeneous turbulence to the formation of zonal\nflows) occurs just below the threshold for linear instability. The scenario\nprovides a new interpretation of the random forcing that is ubiquitously\ninvoked in stochastic models such as the second-order cumulant expansion (CE2)\nor stochastic structural instability theory (SSST); neither intrinsic\nturbulence nor coupling to extrinsic turbulence is required. A representative\ncalculation of the zonostrophic neutral curve is made for a simple two-field\nmodel of toroidal ion-temperature-gradient-driven modes. To the extent that the\ndamping of zonal flows is controlled by the ion--ion collision rate, the point\nof zonostrophic instability is independent of that rate.\n", "  For data sets populated by a very well modeled process and by another process\nof unknown probability density function (PDF), a desired feature when\nmanipulating the fraction of the unknown process (either for enhancing it or\nsuppressing it) consists in avoiding to modify the kinematic distributions of\nthe well modeled one. A bootstrap technique is used to identify sub-samples\nrich in the well modeled process, and classify each event according to the\nfrequency of it being part of such sub-samples. Comparisons with general MVA\nalgorithms will be shown, as well as a study of the asymptotic properties of\nthe method, making use of a public domain data set that models a typical search\nfor new physics as performed at hadronic colliders such as the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC).\n", "  The quantity $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ measures direct CP violation in Kaon\ndecays. Recent SM predictions show a $2.9\\sigma$ tension with data, with the\ntheoretical uncertainty dominating. As rapid progress on the lattice is\nbringing nonperturbative long-distance effects under control, a more precise\nknowledge of short-distance contributions is needed. We describe the first NNLO\nresults for $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ and discuss future prospects, as well as\nissues of scheme dependence and the separation of perturbative and\nnonperturbative effects. Finally we also comment on the solution of the\nrenormalisation-group evolution in one of the talks at this conference and\npresent the correct solution.\n", "  Using the recent first lattice results of the RBC-UKQCD collaboration for $K\n\\to \\pi\\pi$ decays, we perform a phenomenological analysis of\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ and find a discrepancy between SM prediction\nand experiments by $\\sim 3\\,\\sigma$. We discuss an explanation by new physics.\nThe well-understood value of $\\epsilon_K$, which quantifies indirect $CP$\nviolation, however, typically prevents large new physics contributions to\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$. In this talk, we show a solution of the\n$\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}/\\epsilon_K$ discrepancy in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model with squark masses above 3 TeV without fine-tuning of $CP$\nphases. In this solution, the Trojan penguin diagram gives large\nisospin-breaking contributions which enhance $\\epsilon_K^{\\prime}$, while the\ncontribution to $\\epsilon_K$ is suppressed thanks to the Majorana nature of\ngluinos.\n", "  At finite baryon density lattice QCD first-principle calculations can not be\nperformed due to the sign problem. In order to circumvent this problem, we use\nthe canonical approach, which provides reliable analytical continuation from\nthe imaginary chemical potential region to the real chemical potential region.\nWe briefly present the canonical partition function method, describe our\nformulation, and show the results, obtained for two temperatures: $T/T_c =\n0.93$ and $T/T_c = 0.99$ in lattice QCD with two flavors of improved Wilson\nfermions.\n", "  The quasi-coherent effects in two-dimensional incompressible turbulence are\nanalyzed starting from the test particle trajectories. They can acquire\ncoherent aspects when the stochastic potential has slow time variation and the\nmotion is not strongly perturbed. The trajectories are, in these conditions,\nrandom sequences of large jumps and trapping or eddying events. Trapping\ndetermines quasi-coherent trajectory structures, which have a micro-confinement\neffect that is reflected in the transport coefficients. They determine\nnon-Gaussian statistics and flows associated to an average velocity. Trajectory\nstructures also influence the test modes on turbulent plasmas. Nonlinear\ndamping and generation of zonal flow modes is found in drift turbulence in\nuniform magnetic field. The coupling of test particle and test mode studies\npermitted to evaluate the self-consistent evolution of the drift turbulence in\nan iterated approach. The results show an important nonlinear effect of ion\ndiffusion, which can prevent the transition to the nonlinear regime at small\ndrive of the instability. At larger drive, quasi-coherent trajectory structures\nappear and they have complex effects on turbulence.\n", "  The two-dimensional ideal fluid and the plasma confined by a strong magnetic\nfield exhibit an intrinsic tendency to organization due to the inverse spectral\ncascade. In the asymptotic states reached at relaxation the turbulence has\nvanished and there are only coherent vortical structures. We are interested in\nthe regime that precedes these ordered flow patterns, in which there still is\nturbulence and imperfect but robust structures have emerged. To develop an\nanalytical description we propose to start from the stationary coherent states\nand (in the direction opposite to relaxation) explore the space of\nconfigurations before the extremum of the functional that defines the\nstructures has been reached. We find necessary to assemble different but\nrelated models: point-like vortices, its field theoretical formulation as\ninteracting matter and gauge fields, chiral model and surfaces with constant\nmean curvature. These models are connected by the similar ability to describe\nrandomly interacting coherent structures. They derive exactly the same equation\nfor the asymptotic state (sinh-Poisson equation, confirmed by numerical\ncalculation of fluid flows). The chiral model, to which one can arrive from\nself-duality equation of the field theoretical model for fluid and from\nconstant mean curvature surface equations, appears to be the suitable\nanalytical framework. Its solutions, the unitons, aquire dynamics when the\nsystem is not at the extremum of the action. In the present work we provide\narguments that the underlying common nature of these models can be used to\ndevelop an approach to fluid and plasma states of turbulence interacting with\nstructures.\n", "  We present novel method for the organisation of events. The method is based\non comparing event-by-event histograms of a chosen quantity Q that is measured\nfor each particle in every event. The events are organised in such a way that\nthose with similar shape of the Q-histograms end-up placed close to each other.\nWe apply the method on histograms of azimuthal angle of the produced hadrons in\nultrarelativsitic nuclear collisions. By selecting events with similar\nazimuthal shape of their hadron distribution one chooses events which are\nlikely that they underwent similar evolution from the initial state to the\nfreeze-out. Such events can more easily be compared to theoretical simulations\nwhere all conditions can be controlled. We illustrate the method on data\nsimulated by the AMPT model.\n", "  Minijets and jets are produced in large numbers in nuclear collisions at TeV\nenergies, so that there are many of them in a single fireball. They deposit\nnon-negligible amount of momentum and energy into the hydrodynamically\nexpanding bulk and cause anisotropies of the expansion. Moreover, due to their\nmultiple production in a single event the resulting anisotropies are correlated\nwith the collision geometry and thus contribute positively also to\nevent-averaged anisotropies in non-central collisions. Using simulations with\nthree-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic model we demonstrate the importance of\nthis effect. It must be taken into account if conclusions about the properties\nof the hot matter are to be drawn.\n", "  We predict the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios in the hydrogen-helium envelope\nand atmospheres of a sample of nearly 50 relatively cool ($T_{\\mathrm eq}<$\n1000 K) transiting gas giant planets. The method involves planetary envelope\nmetallicity estimates that use the structure models of Thorngren et al. (2016)\nand the disk and planetary accretion model of \\\"Oberg et al. (2011). We find\nthat nearly all of these planets are strongly metal-enriched which, coupled\nwith the fact that solid material is the main deliverer of metals in the\nprotoplanetary disk, implies that the substellar C/O ratios of their accreted\nsolid material dominate compared to the enhanced C/O ratio of their accreted\ngaseous component. We predict that these planets will have atmospheres that are\ntypically reduced in their C/O compared to parent star values independent of\nthe assessed formation locations, with C/O $<1$ a nearly universal outcome\nwithin the framework of the model. We expect water vapor absorption features to\nbe ubiquitous in the atmospheres of these planets, and by extension, other gas\ngiants.\n", "  Nematic elastomers are rubbery solids which have liquid crystals incorporated\ninto their polymer chains. These materials display many unusual mechanical\nproperties, one such being the ability to form fine-scale microstructure. In\nthis work, we explore the response of taut and appreciably stressed sheets made\nof nematic elastomer. Such sheets feature two potential instabilities -- the\nformation of fine-scale material microstructure and the formation of fine-scale\nwrinkles. We develop a theoretical framework to study these sheets that\naccounts for both instabilities, and we implement this framework numerically.\nSpecifically, we show that these instabilities occur for distinct mesoscale\nstretches, and observe that microstructure is finer than wrinkles for\nphysically relevant parameters. Therefore, we relax (i.e., implicitly but\nrigorously account for) the microstructure while we regularize (i.e., compute\nthe details explicitly) the wrinkles. Using both analytical and numerical\nstudies, we show that nematic elastomer sheets can suppress wrinkling by\nmodifying the expected state of stress through the formation of microstructure.\n", "  This paper describes continuously phase-modulated standing surface acoustic\nwaves (CPM-SSAW) and its application for particle separation in multiple\npressure nodes. A linear change of phase in CPM-SSAW applies a force to\nparticles whose magnitude depends on their size and contrast factors. During\ncontinuous phase modulation, we demonstrate that particles with the target\ndimension are translated in the direction of moving pressure nodes, whereas\nsmaller particles show oscillatory movements. The rate of phase modulation is\noptimized for separation of target particles from the relationship between mean\nparticle velocity and period of oscillation. The developed technique is applied\nto separate particles of the target dimension from the particle mixture.\nFurthermore, we also demonstrate human keratinocyte cells can be separated in\nthe cell and bead mixture. The separation technique is incorporated with a\nmicrofluidic channel spanning multiple pressure nodes, which is advantageous\nover separation in a single pressure node in terms of high throughput.\n", "  We report thickness-tuned electrical transport and Hall resistivity in highly\nanisotropic three-dimensional Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 nanosheets. We find that\nwhen the thickness of the nanosheet is blow about 40 nm, the system takes a\nclear transition from topological semimetal with two bands carriers to a single\nband with conventional hole carriers. The resistivity peak temperature T*\ndecreases systematically with decreasing thickness down to about 40 nm, then\nshifts up with the further decrease of the thickness. Analysis of the data\nbelow 40 nm indicates that the hole carriers completely dominate the transport\nin the entire temperature range, regardless of the temperature being below or\nabove T*. By further tracking the carrier density, we find that the Fermi level\nshifts consecutively downward from conduction band to the valence band as\ndecreasing the thickness. Our experiments unambiguously reveal a highly\nthickness-tuned transition of band topology in ZrTe5 nanosheets.\n", "  We analytically study the relation between quark confinement and spontaneous\nchiral-symmetry breaking in QCD. In terms of the Dirac eigenmodes, we derive\nsome formulae for the Polyakov loop, its fluctuations, and the string tension\nfrom the Wilson loop. We also investigate the Polyakov loop in terms of the\neigenmodes of the Wilson, the clover and the domain wall fermion kernels,\nrespectively. For the confinement quantities, the low-lying Dirac/fermion\neigenmodes are found to give negligible contribution, while they are essential\nfor chiral symmetry breaking. These relations indicate no direct one-to-one\ncorrespondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD, which\nseems to be natural because confinement is realized independently of the quark\nmass.\n", "  We present a new model, MULTI-VP, that computes the three-dimensional\nstructure of the solar wind which includes the chromosphere, the transition\nregion, and the corona and low heliosphere. MULTI-VP calculates a large\nensemble of wind profiles flowing along open magnetic field-lines which sample\nthe whole three-dimensional atmosphere or, alternatively, on a given region of\ninterest. The radial domain starts from the photosphere and extends, typically,\nto about 30 $R_{sun}$ . The elementary uni-dimensional wind solutions are based\non a mature numerical scheme which was adapted in order to accept any flux-tube\ngeometry. We discuss here the first results obtained with this model. We use\nPotential Field Source-Surface (PFSS) extrapolations of magnetograms from the\nWilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) to determine the structure of the background\nmagnetic field. Our results support the hypothesis that the geometry of the\nmagnetic flux-tubes in the lower corona controls the distribution of slow and\nfast wind flows. The inverse correlation between density and speed faraway from\nthe Sun is a global effect resulting from small readjustments of the flux-tube\ncross-sections in the high corona (necessary to achieve global pressure balance\nand a uniform open flux distribution). In comparison to current global MHD\nmodels, MULTI-VP performs much faster and does not suffer from spurious\ncross-field diffusion effects. We show that MULTI-VP has the capability to\npredict correctly the dynamical and thermal properties of the background solar\nwind (wind speed, density, temperature, magnetic field amplitude and other\nderived quantities) and to approach real-time operation requirements.\n", "  The low-lying spectra of $^{24,25,26}{\\rm Ne}$ and the structure of the pygmy\ndipole resonance (PDR) in $^{26}{\\rm Ne}$ have been theoretically studied by\nthe antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) and its extended version called\nshifted-basis AMD. The calculated energy and strength of the PDR reasonably\nagree with the observation, and the analysis of the wave function shows that\nthe PDR is dominated by neutron excitation coupled to the quadrupole excited\ncore nucleus $^{25}{\\rm Ne}$, which explains the observed unexpected decay of\nPDR to the excited states of $^{25}{\\rm Ne}$. The large isoscalar component of\nPDR is also shown and the enhancement of the core excitation in neutron-rich Ne\nisotopes is conjectured.\n", "  Mechanical resonators based on low-dimensional materials provide a unique\nplatform for exploring a broad range of physical phenomena. The mechanical\nvibrational states are indeed extremely sensitive to charges, spins, photons,\nand adsorbed masses. However, the roadblock is often the readout of the\nresonator, since the detection of the vibrational states becomes increasingly\ndifficult for smaller resonators. Here, we report an unprecedentedly sensitive\nmethod to detect nanotube resonators with effective masses in the 10^-20 kg\nrange. We use the beam of an electron microscope to resolve the mechanical\nfluctuations of a nanotube in real-time for the first time. We obtain full\naccess to the thermally-driven Brownian motion of the resonator, both in space\nand time domains. Our results establish the viability of carbon nanotube\nresonator technology at room temperature and pave the way towards the\nobservation of novel thermodynamics regimes and quantum effects in\nnano-mechanics.\n", "  We report on the diversity in quasar spectra from the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey. After filtering the spectra to mitigate selection effects\nand Malmquist bias associated with a nearly flux-limited sample, we create high\nsignal-to-noise ratio composite spectra from 58,656 quasars (2.1 \\le z \\le\n3.5), binned by luminosity, spectral index, and redshift. With these composite\nspectra, we confirm the traditional Baldwin effect (BE, i.e., the\nanticorrelation of C IV equivalent width (EW) and luminosity) that follows the\nrelation W_\\lambda \\propto L^{\\beta_w} with slope \\beta_w = -0.35 \\pm 0.004,\n-0.35 \\pm 0.005, and -0.41 \\pm 0.005 for z = 2.25, 2.46, and 2.84,\nrespectively. In addition to the redshift evolution in the slope of the BE, we\nfind redshift evolution in average quasar spectral features at fixed\nluminosity. The spectroscopic signature of the redshift evolution is correlated\nat 98% with the signature of varying luminosity, indicating that they arise\nfrom the same physical mechanism. At a fixed luminosity, the average C IV FWHM\ndecreases with increasing redshift and is anti-correlated with C IV EW. The\nspectroscopic signature associated with C IV FWHM suggests that the trends in\nluminosity and redshift are likely caused by a superposition of effects that\nare related to black hole mass and Eddington ratio. The redshift evolution is\nthe consequence of a changing balance between these two quantities as quasars\nevolve toward a population with lower typical accretion rates at a given black\nhole mass.\n", "  We give a brief representation of the theoretical results from the color\ndipole picture, covering the total photoabsorption cross section, high-energy\n$J/\\psi$ photoproduction with respect to recent experimental data from the LHCb\nCollaboration at CERN, and ultra-high energy neutrino scattering, relevant for\nthe ICE-CUBE experiment.\n", "  The simple concept of a SIC poses a very deep problem in algebraic number\ntheory, as soon as the dimension of Hilbert space exceeds three. A detailed\ndescription of the simplest possible example is given.\n", "  We consider a model where the electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by\nstrong dynamics, resulting in an electroweak doublet scalar condensate, and\ntransmitted to the standard model matter fields via another electroweak doublet\nscalar. At low energies the effective theory therefore shares features with a\ntype-I two Higgs doublet model. However, important differences arise due to the\nrich composite spectrum expected to contain new vector resonances accessible at\nthe LHC. We carry out a systematic analysis of the vector resonance signals at\nLHC and find that the model remains viable, but will be tightly constrained by\ndirect searches as the projected integrated luminosity, around 200 fb$^{-1}$,\nof the current run becomes available.\n", "  The Tunka Radio Extension (Tunka-Rex) is a radio detector at the TAIGA\nfacility located in Siberia nearby the southern tip of Lake Baikal. Tunka-Rex\nmeasures air-showers induced by high-energy cosmic rays, in particular, the\nlateral distribution of the radio pulses. The depth of the air-shower maximum,\nwhich statistically depends on the mass of the primary particle, is determined\nfrom the slope of the lateral distribution function (LDF). Using a\nmodel-independent approach, we have studied possible features of the\none-dimensional slope method and tried to find improvements for the\nreconstruction of primary mass. To study the systematic uncertainties given by\ndifferent primary particles, we have performed simulations using the CONEX and\nCoREAS software packages of the recently released CORSIKA v7.5 including the\nmodern high-energy hadronic models QGSJet-II.04 and EPOS-LHC. The simulations\nhave shown that the largest systematic uncertainty in the energy deposit is due\nto the unknown primary particle. Finally, we studied the relation between the\npolarization and the asymmetry of the LDF.\n", "  Although the seesaw mechanism is a natural explanation for the small neutrino\nmasses, there are cases when the Majorana mass terms for the right-handed\nneutrinos are not allowed due to symmetry. In that case, if neutrino-specific\nHiggs doublet is introduced, neutrinos become Dirac particles and their small\nmasses can be explained by its small VEV. We show that the same symmetry, which\nwe assume a global $U(1)_X$, can also be used to explain the stability of dark\nmatter. In our model, a new singlet scalar breaks the global symmetry\nspontaneously down to a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The dark matter particle,\nlightest $Z_2$-odd fermion, is stabilized. We discuss the phenomenology of dark\nmatter: relic density, direct detection, and indirect detection. We find that\nthe relic density can be explained by a novel Goldstone boson channel or by\nresonance channel. In the most region of parameter space considered, the direct\ndetections is suppressed well below the current experimental bound. Our model\ncan be further tested in indirect detection experiments such as FermiLAT gamma\nray searches or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.\n", "  A geometrical correction to the E x B drift causes an outward flux of\ncocurrent momentum whenever electrostatic potential energy is transferred to\nion parallel flows. The robust symmetry breaking follows from the free energy\nflow in phase space and does not depend on any assumed linear eigenmode\nstructure, acting both for axisymmetric fluctuations (such as geodesic acoustic\nmodes) as well as more general nonaxisymmetric fluctuations. The resulting\nrotation peaking is countercurrent and scales as electron temperature over\nplasma current. This peaking mechanism can only act when fluctuations are\nlow-frequency enough to excite ion parallel flows, which may explain some\nrecent experimental observations related to rotation reversals.\n", "  The modeling of complex reaction-diffusion processes in, for instance,\ncellular biochemical networks or self-assembling soft matter can be\ntremendously sped up by employing a multiscale algorithm which combines the\nmesoscopic Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD) method with explicit\nstochastic Brownian, Langevin, or deterministic Molecular Dynamics to treat\nreactants at the microscopic scale [A. Vijaykumar, P.G. Bolhuis and P.R. ten\nWolde, J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 43}, 21: 214102 (2015)]. Here we extend this\nmultiscale BD-GFRD approach to include the orientational dynamics that is\ncrucial to describe the anisotropic interactions often prevalent in\nbiomolecular systems. We illustrate the novel algorithm using a simple patchy\nparticle model. After validation of the algorithm we discuss its performance.\nThe rotational BD-GFRD multiscale method will open up the possibility for large\nscale simulations of e.g. protein signalling networks.\n", "  In a recent article by P. Hockett \\textit{et al.}, time delays arising in the\ncontext of molecular single-photon ionization are investigated from a\ntheoretical point of view. We argue that one of the central equations derived\nin the paper is incorrect and present a reformulation that is consistent with\nthe established treatment of angle-dependent scattering delays.\n", "  We perform a large suite of $N=4$ numerical scattering experiments between\ntwo identical binaries consisting of identical point particles in a\n(continuous) background potential. For investigative purposes, albeit without\nloss of generality, we assume that the potential corresponds to a uniform\n(natal or star-forming) gas medium. We explore a range of constant gas\ndensities, from $n=10~ {\\rm cm}^{-3}$ to $10^{5}~ {\\rm cm}^{-3}$. These\ndensities are relevant for various astrophysical environments, including\nmolecular clouds (i.e., star-forming regions) and denser, fragmented cores\nwithin these clouds. Our primary goal is to characterize the effects of the\nbackground potential on the subsequent stellar dynamics. We consider the\noutcome probabilities as well as the properties of any binaries formed during\nthe binary-binary encounters, such as the distributions of binary binding\nenergies and eccentricities. We also present the final velocity distributions\nof the ejected single stars. The background potential has two important effects\non the stellar dynamics: 1) The potential acts to reset the zero-point of the\ntotal system energy, which in turn affects the types and properties of the\nproducts of the encounter; 2) For higher $n$ and weakly bound systems (i.e.,\nlarge semimajor axes), the stellar dynamics are significantly affected when\nstars become trapped in the potential, oscillating around the system centre of\nmass (CM). This, in turn, increases the number of scattering events between\nstars (single, binary or triple) near the CM and makes it harder for single\nstars to escape to infinity. This ultimately leads to the preferential\nionization of triples and wide binaries and the survival of compact binaries,\nwith the single stars escaping at very high ejection velocities.\n", "  In this article the phenomenon of degravitation of the cosmological constant\nis studied in the framework of bigravity. It is demonstrated that despite a\nsizable value of the cosmological constant its gravitational effect can be only\nmild. The bigravity framework is chosen for this demonstration as it leads to a\nconsistent, ghost-free theory of massive gravity. We show that degravitation\ntakes place in the limit where the physical graviton is dominantly a gauge\ninvariant metric combination. We present and discuss several phenomenological\nconsequences expected in this regime.\n", "  In this paper, we review the recent developments in the field of\nbuoyancy-driven turbulence. Scaling and numerical arguments show that the\nstably-stratified turbulence with moderate stratification has kinetic energy\nspectrum $E_u(k) \\sim k^{-11/5}$ and the kinetic energy flux $\\Pi_u(k) \\sim\nk^{-4/5}$, which is called Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling. The energy flux for the\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection (RBC) however is approximately constant in the\ninertial range that results in Kolmorogorv's spectrum ($E_u(k) \\sim k^{-5/3}$)\nfor the kinetic energy. The phenomenology of RBC should apply to other flows\nwhere the buoyancy feeds the kinetic energy, e.g. bubbly turbulence and\nfully-developed Rayleigh Taylor instability. This paper also covers several\nmodels that predict the Reynolds and Nusselt numbers of RBC. Recent works show\nthat the viscous dissipation rate of RBC scales as $\\sim \\mathrm{Ra}^{1.3}$,\nwhere $\\mathrm{Ra}$ is the Rayleigh number.\n", "  By means of free fermionic techniques combined with multiple precision\narithmetic we study the time evolution of the average magnetization,\n$\\overline{m}(t)$, of the random transverse-field Ising chain after global\nquenches. We observe different relaxation behaviors for quenches starting from\ndifferent initial states to the critical point. Starting from a fully ordered\ninitial state, the relaxation is logarithmically slow described by\n$\\overline{m}(t) \\sim \\ln^a t$, and in a finite sample of length $L$ the\naverage magnetization saturates at a size-dependent plateau $\\overline{m}_p(L)\n\\sim L^{-b}$; here the two exponents satisfy the relation $b/a=\\psi=1/2$.\nStarting from a fully disordered initial state, the magnetization stays at zero\nfor a period of time until $t=t_d$ with $\\ln t_d \\sim L^{\\psi}$ and then starts\nto increase until it saturates to an asymptotic value $\\overline{m}_p(L) \\sim\nL^{-b'}$, with $b'\\approx 1.5$. For both quenching protocols, finite-size\nscaling is satisfied in terms of the scaled variable $\\ln t/L^{\\psi}$.\nFurthermore, the distribution of long-time limiting values of the magnetization\nshows that the typical and the average values scale differently and the average\nis governed by rare events. The non-equilibrium dynamical behavior of the\nmagnetization is explained through semi-classical theory.\n", "  Interactions between whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and small nanoparticles\nare commonly modelled by treating the particle as a point dipole scatterer.\nThis approach is assumed to be accurate as long as the nanoparticle radius,\n$a$, is small compared to the WGM wavelength $\\lambda$. In this article,\nhowever, we show that the large field gradients associated with the evanescent\ndecay of a WGM causes the dipole theory to significantly underestimate the\ninteraction strength, and hence induced WGM resonance shift, even for particles\nas small as $a\\sim \\lambda/10$. To mitigate this issue we employ a renormalized\nBorn approximation to more accurately determine nanoparticle induced resonance\nshifts and hence enable improved particle sizing. The domain of validity of\nthis approximation is investigated and supporting experimental results are\npresented.\n", "  It is well known that many biochemical processes in the cell such as gene\nregulation, growth signals and activation of ion channels, rely on mechanical\nstimuli. However, the mechanism by which mechanical signals propagate through\ncells is not as well understood. In this review we focus on stress propagation\nin a minimal model for cell elasticity, actomyosin networks, which are\ncomprised of a sub-family of cytoskeleton proteins. After giving an overview of\nth actomyosin network components, structure and evolution we review stress\npropagation in these materials as measured through the correlated motion of\ntracer beads. We also discuss the possibility to extract structural features of\nthese networks from the same experiments. We show that stress transmission\nthrough these networks has two pathways, a quickly dissipative one through the\nbulk, and a long ranged weakly dissipative one through the pre-stressed actin\nnetwork.\n", "  We present a model to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of guided modes\nin semiconductor nanowires based on a coupled mode formalism. Light-matter\ninteraction is modelled based on semiconductor Bloch equations, including\nmany-particle effects in the screened Hartree-Fock approximation. Appropriate\nboundary conditions are used to incorporate reflections at waveguide endfacets,\nthus allowing for the simulation of nanowire lasing. We compute the emission\ncharacteristics and temporal dynamics of CdS and ZnO nanowire lasers and\ncompare our results both to Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations and to\nexperimental data. Finally, we explore the dependence of the lasing emission on\nthe nanowire cavity and on the materials relaxation time.\n", "  Tricritical Casimir forces in $^3\\text{He}$ -$^4\\text{He}$ wetting films are\nstudied, within mean field theory, in therms of a suitable lattice gas model\nfor binary liquid mixtures with short--ranged surface fields. The proposed\nmodel takes into account the continuous rotational symmetry O(2) of the\nsuperfluid degrees of freedom associated with $^4\\text{He}$ and it allows,\ninter alia, for the occurrence of a vapor phase. As a result, the model\nfacilitates the formation of wetting films, which provides a strengthened\ntheoretical framework to describe available experimental data for tricritical\nCasimir forces acting in $^3\\text{He}$ -$^4\\text{He}$ wetting films.\n", "  Using an offline cross-correlation technique, we have analyzed the noise\nbehavior of a new type of optical frequency comb (OFC), which is carrier\nenvelope offset (CEO) free by configuration, due to difference frequency\ngeneration. In order to evaluate the instrument's ultimate noise floor, the\nphase and amplitude noise of a stabilized OFC are measured simultaneously using\ntwo analog-to-digital converters. Carrier recovery and phase detection are done\nby post-processing, eliminating the need for external phase-locked loops and\ncomplex calibration techniques. In order to adapt the measurement noise floor\nand the number of averages used in cross correlation, an adaptive frequency\nresolution for noise measurement is applied. Phase noise results are in\nexcellent agreement with measurements of the fluctuations of the repetition\nfrequency of the OFC obtained from optical signal.\n", "  Modern facilities are poised to tackle fundamental questions within the\nStandard Model, aiming to reveal the nature of confinement, its relationship to\ndynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) - the origin of visible mass - and\nthe connection between these two, key emergent phenomena. There is strong\nevidence to suggest that they are intimately connected with the appearance of\nmomentum-dependent masses for gluons and quarks in QCD, which are large in the\ninfrared: $m_g \\sim 500\\,$MeV and $M_q\\sim 350\\,$MeV. DCSB, expressed in the\ndynamical generation of a dressed-quark mass, has an enormous variety of\nverifiable consequences, including an enigmatic result that the properties of\nthe (almost) massless pion are the cleanest expression of the mechanism which\nis responsible for almost all the visible mass in the Universe. This\ncontribution explains that these emergent phenomena are expressed with\nparticular force in the partonic structure of hadrons, e.g. in valence-quark\nparton distribution amplitudes and functions, and, consequently, in numerous\nhadronic observables, so that we are now in a position to exhibit the\nconsequences of confinement and DCSB in a wide range of hadron observables,\nopening the way to empirical verification of their expression in the Standard\nModel.\n", "  Off-shell $(4,q)$ supermultiplets in 2-dimensions are constructed for\n$q=1,2,4$. These are used to construct sigma models whose target spaces are\nhyperk\\\"ahler with torsion. The off-shell supersymmetry implies the three\ncomplex structures are simultaneously integrable and allows us to construct\nactions using extended superspace and projective superspace, giving an explicit\nconstruction of the target space geometries.\n", "  Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is an advanced\nmanufacturing technique that allows the fabrication of arbitrary macroscopic\nand microscopic objects. All 3D printing systems require large optical elements\nor nozzles in proximity to the built structure. This prevents their use in\napplications in which there is no direct access to the area where the objects\nhave to be printed. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional microfabrication\nbased on two-photon polymerization (TPP) with sub diffraction-limited\nresolution through an ultra-thin, 50 mm long printing nozzle of 560 micrometers\nin diameter. Using wavefront shaping, femtosecond infrared pulses are focused\nand scanned through a multimode optical fiber (MMF) inside a photoresist that\npolymerizes via two-photon absorption. We show the construction of arbitrary 3D\nstructures of 500 nm resolution on the other side of the fiber. To our\nknowledge, this is the first demonstration of microfabrication through a\nmultimode optical fiber. Our work represents a new area which we refer to as\nendofabrication.\n", "  Bell's theorem shows a profound contradiction between local realism and\nquantum mechanics on the level of statistical predictions. It does not involve\ndirectly Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. The paradox of\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) disproves directly the concept of EPR\nelements of reality, based on the EPR correlations, in an all-versus-nothing\nway. A three-qubit experimental demonstration of the GHZ paradox was achieved\nnearly twenty years ago, and followed by demonstrations for more qubits. Still,\nthe GHZ contradictions underlying the tests can be reduced to three-qubit one.\nWe show an irreducible four-qubit GHZ paradox, and report its experimental\ndemonstration. The reducibility loophole is closed. The bound of a\nthree-setting per party Bell-GHZ inequality is violated by $7\\sigma$. The\nfidelity of the GHZ state was around $81\\%$, and an entanglement witness\nreveals a violation of the separability threshold by $19\\sigma$.\n", "  Black phosphorene is not stable at ambient conditions, so atomic defects and\noxidation effects are unavoidable in black phosphorus samples in the\nexperiment. The effects of these defects on the performance of the black\nphosphorus nanoresonators are still unclear. Here, we perform classical\nmolecular dynamics to investigate the effects of the vacancy and oxidation on\nsingle-layer black phosphorus nanoresonators at different temperatures. We find\nthat the vacancy causes strong reduction in the quality factor of the\nnanoresonators, while the oxidation has weaker effect on the nanoresonators.\nMore specifically, a 2% concentration of randomly distributed single vacancies\nis able to reduce the quality factor by about 80% and 40% at 4.2K and 50K,\nrespectively. We also find that the quality factor of the nanoresonator is not\nsensitive to the distribution pattern of the vacancy defects.\n", "  Long-range correlations between particles separated by a pseudorapidity gap\nare a powerful tool to explore the initial stages and evolution of the medium\ncreated in hadron-hadron collisions. An overview of the long-range correlations\nmeasured by the ALICE detector in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb will be presented. This\nincludes analyses of forward-backward, two- and multi-particle correlations\nwith the use of the central barrel and forward detectors.\n", "  Spectra of $q \\bar q$ mesons are investigated in the framework of the\nHamiltonian obtained from the relativistic path integral in external\nhomogeneous magnetic field. The spectra of all 12 spin-isospin s-wave states\ngenerated by $\\pi$- and $\\rho$-mesons with different spin projections, are\nstudied analytically as functions of the field strength. Three types of\nbehavior with characteristic splittings are found. The results are in agreement\nwith recent lattice calculations.\n", "  Losses should be accounted for in a complete description of quantum imaging\nsystems, and yet they are often treated as undesirable and largely neglected.\nIn conventional quantum imaging, images are built up by coincidence detection\nof spatially entangled photon pairs (biphotons) transmitted through an object.\nHowever, as real objects are non-unitary (absorptive), part of the transmitted\nstate contains only a single photon, which is overlooked in traditional\ncoincidence measurements. The single photon part has a drastically different\nspatial distribution than the two-photon part. It contains information both\nabout the object, and, remarkably, the spatial entanglement properties of the\nincident biphotons. We image the one- and two-photon parts of the transmitted\nstate using an electron multiplying CCD array both as a traditional camera and\nas a massively parallel coincidence counting apparatus, and demonstrate\nagreement with theoretical predictions. This work may prove useful for photon\nnumber imaging and lead to techniques for entanglement characterization that do\nnot require coincidence measurements.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance of a clean\nstrongly interacting quantum wire in the presence of a helical nuclear spin\norder. The nuclear spin helix opens a temperature-dependent partial gap in the\nelectron spectrum. Using a bosonization framework we describe the gapped\nelectron modes by sine-Gordon-like kinks. We predict an internal resistivity\ncaused by an Ohmic-like friction these kinks experience via interacting with\ngapless excitations. As a result, the conductance rises from $G=e^2/h$ at\ntemperatures below the critical temperature when nuclear spins are fully\npolarized to $G=2e^2/h$ at higher temperatures when the order is destroyed,\nfeaturing a relatively wide plateau in the intermediate regime. The theoretical\nresults are compared with the experimental data for GaAs quantum wires obtained\nrecently by Scheller et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 066801 (2014)].\n", "  We describe an application of the Monte Carlo method to the Janus deformation\nof the black brane background. We present numerical results for three and five\ndimensional black Janus geometries with planar and spherical interfaces. In\nparticular, we argue that the 5D geometry with a spherical interface has an\napplication in understanding the finite temperature bag-like QCD model via the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. The accuracy and convergence of the algorithm are\nevaluated with respect to the grid spacing. The systematic errors of the method\nare determined using an exact solution of 3D black Janus. This numerical\napproach for solving linear problems is unaffected initial guess of a trial\nsolution and can handle an arbitrary geometry under various boundary conditions\nin the presence of source fields.\n", "  A solid state spin is an attractive system with which to realize an\nultra-sensitive magnetic field sensor. A spin superposition state will acquire\na phase induced by the target field, and we can estimate the field strength\nfrom this phase. Recent studies have aimed at improving sensitivity through the\nuse of quantum error correction (QEC) to detect and correct any bit-flip errors\nthat may occur during the sensing period. Here, we investigate the performance\nof a two-qubit sensor employing QEC and under the effect of energy relaxation.\nSurprisingly, we find that the standard QEC technique to detect and recover\nfrom an error does not improve the sensitivity compared with the single-qubit\nsensors. This is a consequence of the fact that the energy relaxation induces\nboth a phase-flip and a bit-flip noise where the former noise cannot be\ndistinguished from the relative phase induced from the target fields. However,\nwe have found that we can improve the sensitivity if we adopt postselection to\ndiscard the state when error is detected. Even when quantum error detection is\nmoderately noisy, and allowing for the cost of the postselection technique, we\nfind that this two-qubit system shows an advantage in sensing over a single\nqubit in the same conditions.\n", "  We study the effect of quantum corrections on heterotic compactifications on\nelliptic fibrations away from the stable degeneration limit, elaborating on a\nrecent observation by Malmendier and Morrison. We show that already for the\nsimplest non-trivial elliptic fibration the effect is quite dramatic: the $I_1$\ndegeneration with trivial gauge background dynamically splits into two T-fects\nwith monodromy around each T-fect being (conjugate to) T-duality along one of\nthe legs of the $T^2$. This implies that almost every elliptic heterotic\ncompactification becomes a non-geometric T-fold away from the stable\ndegeneration limit. We also point out a subtlety due to this non-geometric\nsplitting at finite fiber size. It arises when determining, via\nheterotic/F-theory duality, the SCFTs associated to a small number of pointlike\ninstantons probing heterotic ADE singularities. Along the way we resolve\nvarious puzzles in the literature.\n", "  Accepting that there is a mass gap above the electroweak scale, the\nElectroweak Effective Theory (EWET) is an appropriate tool to describe this\nsituation. Since the EWET couplings contain information on the unknown\nhigh-energy dynamics, we consider a generic strongly-coupled scenario of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, where the known particle fields are coupled to\nheavier states. Then, and by integrating out these heavy fields, we study the\ntracks of the lightest resonances into the couplings. The determination of the\nlow-energy couplings (LECs) in terms of resonance parameters can be made more\nprecise by considering a proper short-distance behaviour on the Lagrangian with\nheavy states, since the number of resonance couplings is then reduced. Notice\nthat we adopt a generic non-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking with a singlet Higgs.\n", "  We briefly review recent results which we have obtained in the study of\nJ/psi+Z production at the LHC. Considering our NLO computation in the Colour\nEvaporation Model (CEM) as an upper theory limit for the\nsingle-parton-scattering contributions, we claim that the existing data set\nfrom ATLAS points at a dominant double-parton-scattering contribution with an\neffective cross section smaller than that for jet-related observables. As a\nside product of our analysis, we have computed, for the first time, the\none-loop QCD corrections to the J/psi P_T-differential cross section in the\nCEM.\n", "  In the present work, we explore soliton and rogue-like wave solutions in the\ntransmission line analogue of a nonlinear left-handed metamaterial. The\nnonlinearity is expressed through a voltagedependent and symmetric capacitance\nmotivated by the recently developed ferroelectric barium strontium titanate\n(BST) thin film capacitor designs. We develop both the corresponding nonlinear\ndynamical lattice, as well as its reduction via a multiple scales expansion to\na nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) model for the envelope of a given carrier wave.\nThe reduced model can feature either a focusing or a defocusing nonlinearity\ndepending on the frequency (wavenumber) of the carrier. We then consider the\nrobustness of different types of solitary waves of the reduced model within the\noriginal nonlinear left-handed medium. We find that both bright and dark\nsolitons persist in a suitable parametric regime, where the reduction to the\nNLS is valid. Additionally, for suitable initial conditions, we observe a rogue\nwave type of behavior, that differs significantly from the classic Peregrine\nrogue wave evolution, including most notably the breakup of a single\nPeregrine-like pattern into solutions with multiple wave peaks. Finally, we\ntouch upon the behavior of generalized members of the family of the Peregrine\nsolitons, namely Akhmediev breathers and Kuznetsov-Ma solitons, and explore how\nthese evolve in the left-handed transmission line.\n", "  We present a novel illumination control technique for optical diffraction\ntomography (ODT). Various spatial frequencies of beam illumination were\ncontrolled by displaying time-averaged sinusoidal patterns using a digital\nmicromirror device (DMD). Compared to the previous method using binary Lee\nholograms, the present method eliminates unwanted diffracted beams which may\ndeteriorate the image quality of the ODT. We demonstrated the capability of the\npresent method by reconstructing three-dimensional refractive index (RI)\ndistributions of various samples, with high RI sensitivity (\\sigma_\\Delta n =\n3.15 +/- 10-4), and reconstructing 3-D RI tomograms of biological samples,\nwhich provided quantitative biochemical and morphological information about the\nsamples.\n", "  Up-to-date information wirelessly communicated among vehicles can be used to\nselect the optimal route between a given origin and destination. To elucidate\nhow to make use of such information, simulations are performed for autonomous\nvehicles traveling on a square lattice of roads. All the possible routes\nbetween the origin and the destination (without backtracking) are of the same\nlength. Congestion is the only determinant of delay. At each intersection,\nright-of-way is given to the closest vehicle. There are no traffic lights. Trip\ntimes of a subject vehicle are recorded for various initial conditions using\ndifferent routing algorithms. Surprisingly, the simplest algorithm, which is\nbased on the total number of vehicles on a route, is as good as one based on\ncomputing travel times from the average velocity of vehicles on each road\nsegment.\n", "  An essential task of groups is to provide efficient solutions for the complex\nproblems they face. Indeed, considerable efforts have been devoted to the\nquestion of collective decision-making related to problems involving a single\ndominant feature. Here we introduce a quantitative formalism for finding the\noptimal distribution of the group members' competences in the more typical case\nwhen the underlying problem is complex, i.e., multidimensional. Thus, we\nconsider teams that are aiming at obtaining the best possible answer to a\nproblem having a number of independent sub-problems. Our approach is based on a\ngeneric scheme for the process of evaluating the proposed solutions (i.e.,\nnegotiation). We demonstrate that the best performing groups have at least one\nspecialist for each sub-problem -- but a far less intuitive result is that\nfinding the optimal solution by the interacting group members requires that the\nspecialists also have some insight into the sub-problems beyond their unique\nfield(s). We present empirical results obtained by using a large-scale database\nof citations being in good agreement with the above theory. The framework we\nhave developed can easily be adapted to a variety of realistic situations since\ntaking into account the weights of the sub-problems, the opinions or the\nrelations of the group is straightforward. Consequently, our method can be used\nin several contexts, especially when the optimal composition of a group of\ndecision-makers is designed.\n", "  We show that it is possible to design an invisible wavelength-sized\nmetal-dielectric metamaterial object without evoking cloaking. Our approach is\nan extension of the neutral inclusion concept by Zhou and Hu [Phys.Rev.E 74,\n026607 (2006)] to Mie scatterers. We demonstrate that an increase of metal\nfraction in the metamaterial leads to a transition from dielectric-like to\nmetal-like scattering, which proceeds through invisibility or optical\nneutrality of the scatterer. Formally this is due to cancellation of multiple\nscattering orders, similarly to plasmonic cloaking introduced by Alu and\nEngheta [Phys.Rev.E 72, 016623 (2005)], but without introduction of the\nseparation of the scatterer into cloak and hidden regions.\n", "  We construct infinite-dimensional families of non-singular static space\ntimes, solutions of the vacuum Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative\ncosmological constant. The families include an infinite-dimensional family of\nsolutions with the usual AdS conformal structure at conformal infinity.\n", "  We have performed interface-resolved direct numerical simulations of forced\nhomogeneous-isotropic turbulence in a dilute suspension of spherical particles\nin the Reynolds number range Re-lambda=115-140. The solid-fluid density ratio\nwas set to 1.5, gravity was set to zero, and two particle diameters were\ninvestigated corresponding to approximately 5 and 11 Kolmogorov lengths. Note\nthat these particle sizes are clearly outside the range of validity of the\npoint-particle approximation, as has been shown by Homann & Bec (2010). At the\npresent parameter points the global effect of the particles upon the fluid flow\nis weak. We observe that the dispersed phase exhibits clustering with moderate\nintensity. The tendency to cluster, which was quantified in terms of the\nstandard deviation of Voronoi cell volumes, decreases with the particle\ndiameter. We have analyzed the relation between particle locations and the\nlocation of intense vortical flow structures. The results do not reveal any\nsignificant statistical correlation. Contrarily, we have detected a small but\nstatistically significant preferential location of particles with respect to\nthe `sticky points' proposed by Goto & Vassilicos (2008), i.e. points where the\nfluid acceleration field is acting such as to increase the local particle\nconcentration in one-way coupled point-particle models under Stokes drag. The\npresently found statistical correlation between the `sticky points' and the\nparticle locations further increases when focusing on regions with high local\nconcentration. Our results suggest that small finite-size particles can be\nbrought together along the expansive directions of the fluid acceleration\nfield, as previously observed only for the simplest model for sub-Kolmogorov\nparticles. We further discuss the effect of density ratio and collective\nparticle motion upon the basic Eulerian and Lagrangian statistics.\n", "  We use seeing-free high spatial resolution Ca II H data obtained by the\nSUNRISE observatory to determine properties of slender fibrils in the lower\nsolar chromosphere. In this work we use intensity images taken with the SUFI\ninstrument in the Ca II H line during the second scientific flight of the\nSUNRISE observatory to identify and track elongated bright structures. After\nthe identification, we analyze theses structures in order to extract their\nmorphological properties. We identify 598 slender Ca II H fibrils (SCFs) with\nan average width of around 180 km, a length between 500 km and 4000 km, an\naverage lifetime of ~400 s, and an average curvature of 0.002 arcsec^-1. The\nmaximum lifetime of the SCFs within our time series of 57 minutes is ~2000 s.\nWe discuss similarities and differences of the SCFs with other small-scale,\nchromospheric structures such as spicules of type I and II, or Ca II K fibrils.\n", "  The use of the Moon as a detector volume for ultra-high-energy neutrinos and\ncosmic rays, by searching for the Askaryan radio pulse produced when they\ninteract in the lunar regolith, has been attempted by a range of projects over\nthe past two decades. In this contribution, I discuss some of the technical\nconsiderations relevant to these experiments, and their consequent sensitivity\nto ultra-high-energy particles. I also discuss some possible future\nexperiments, and highlight their potential.\n", "  We describe a phase transition that gives rise to structurally non-trivial\nstates in a two-dimensional ordered network of particles connected by harmonic\nbonds. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the network supports, apart from the\nhomogeneous phase, a number of heterogeneous \"pleated\" phases, which can be\nstabilised by an external field. This field is conjugate to a global collective\nvariable quantifying \"non-affineness\", i.e.~the deviation of local particle\ndisplacements from local affine deformation. In the pleated phase, stress is\nlocalised in ordered rows of pleats and eliminated from the rest of the\nlattice. The {\\em kinetics} of the phase transition is unobservably slow in\nmolecular dynamics simulation near coexistence, due to very large free energy\nbarriers. When the external field is increased further to lower these barriers,\nthe network exhibits rich dynamic behaviour: it transforms into a {\\em\nmetastable} phase with the stress now localised in a {\\em disordered}\narrangement of pleats. The pattern of pleats shows ageing dynamics and slow\nrelaxation to equilibrium. Our predictions may be checked by experiments on\ntethered colloidal solids in dynamic laser traps.\n", "  Free electron beams that carry high values of orbital angular momentum (OAM)\npossess large magnetic moments along the propagation direction. This makes them\nan ideal probe for measuring the electronic and magnetic properties of\nmaterials, and for fundamental experiments in magnetism. However, their\ngeneration requires the use of complex diffractive elements, which usually take\nthe form of nano-fabricated holograms. Here, we show how the limitations of\nfocused ion beam milling in the fabrication of such holograms can be overcome\nby using electron beam lithography. We demonstrate experimentally the\nrealization of an electron vortex beam with the largest OAM value that has yet\nbeen reported (L = 1000h\\bar), paving the way for even more demanding\ndemonstrations and applications of electron beam shaping.\n", "  QCD-like theories provide testing grounds for truncations of functional\nequations at non-zero density, since comparisons with lattice results are\npossible due to the absence of the sign problem. As a first step towards such a\ncomparison, we determine for QCD and $G_2$ QCD the chiral and\nconfinement/deconfinement transitions from the quark propagator Dyson-Schwinger\nequation at zero chemical potential by calculating the chiral and dual chiral\ncondensates, respectively.\n", "  Wave transport and scattering in open systems can be profoundly affected by\nnon- Hermitian dynamics. In this work we consider wave scattering in a\none-dimensional tight-binding lattice with a low-frequency\nharmonically-vibrating complex site potential. Floquet scattering is shown to\nbe suppressed in a range of the spectral lattice band, which is limited by a\nsingularity in the spectral transmission/reflection amplitudes for inelastic\nscattering channels. Invisibility over the entire spectral band is found when\nthe singularity is pushed at the edge of the Brillouin zone, which requires a\nmodulation frequency larger than the width of the tight-binding lattice band.\nRemarkably, invisibility is found to persist for multiple oscillating lattice\nimpurities.\n", "  We discuss the possible existence of absolutely stable strange quark matter\nwithin three different types of chiral models. We will show that confinement\nplays a crucial role in determining the conditions for the Bodmer-Witten\nhypothesis to hold true. We discuss also which are the phenomenological\nsignatures, related to measurements of masses and radii of compact stars, which\nwould prove the existence of strange quark stars.\n", "  Measurements of the power spectrum from large-scale structure surveys have to\ndate assumed an equal-time approximation, where the full cross-correlation\npower spectrum of the matter density field evaluated at different times (or\ndistances) has been approximated either by the power spectrum at a fixed time,\nor in an improved fashion, by a geometric mean $P(k; r_1, r_2)=[P(k; r_1) P(k;\nr_2)]^{1/2}$. In this paper we investigate the expected impact of the geometric\nmean ansatz, and present an application in assessing the impact on weak\ngravitational lensing cosmological parameter inference, using a perturbative\nunequal-time correlator. As one might expect, we find that the impact of this\nassumption is greatest at large separations in redshift $\\Delta z > 0.3$ where\nthe change in the amplitude of the matter power spectrum can be as much as $10$\npercent for $k > 5h$Mpc$^{-1}$. However, of more concern is that the\ncorrections for small separations, where the clustering is not close to zero,\nmay not be negligibly small. In particular, we find that for a Euclid- or\nLSST-like weak lensing experiment the assumption of equal-time correlators may\nresult in biased predictions of the cosmic shear power spectrum, and that the\nimpact is strongly dependent on the amplitude of the intrinsic alignment\nsignal. To compute unequal-time correlations to sufficient accuracy will\nrequire advances in either perturbation theory to high $k$-modes, or extensive\nuse of simulations.\n", "  We compute the generation of vorticity from velocity dispersion in the dark\nmatter fluid. For dark matter at zero temperature Helmholtz's theorem dictates\nthat no vorticity is generated and we therefore allow the dark matter fluid to\nhave a non-vanishing velocity dispersion. This implies a modification to the\nusual hydrodynamical system (continuity and Euler equations): we have to\nconsider the Boltzmann hierarchy up to the second moment. This means that the\nEuler equation is modified with a source term that describes the effect of\nnon-zero velocity dispersion. We write an equation for the Eulerian vorticity\nin Lagrangian coordinates and show that it has a growing mode already at second\norder in perturbation theory. We compute the power spectrum of the vorticity\nand the rotational velocity at second order in perturbation theory.\n", "  Bjorken scaling violation in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS)\nis related to the rise of hadronic cross sections by using the additive quark\nmodel. Of special interest is the connection between saturation in the low-$x$\nbehavior of the DIS structure functions (SF) and possible slow-down of the $pp$\ncross section rise due to saturation effects. We also identify saturation\neffects in the DIS SF with phase transition that can be described by the Van\nder Waals equation of state.\n", "  We measure the transport properties of two-dimensional ultracold Fermi gases\nduring transverse demagnetization in a magnetic field gradient. Using a\nphase-coherent spin-echo sequence, we are able to distinguish bare spin\ndiffusion from the Leggett-Rice effect, in which demagnetization is slowed by\nthe precession of spin current around the local magnetization. When the\ntwo-dimensional scattering length is tuned to be comparable to the inverse\nFermi wave vector $k_F^{-1}$, we find that the bare transverse spin diffusivity\nreaches a minimum of $1.7(6)\\hbar/m$, where $m$ is the bare particle mass. The\nrate of demagnetization is also reflected in the growth rate of the s-wave\ncontact, observed using time-resolved spectroscopy. At unitarity, the contact\nrises to $0.28(3) k_F^2$ per particle, measuring the breaking of scaling\nsymmetry. Our observations support the conjecture that in systems with strong\nscattering, the local relaxation rate is bounded from above by $k_B T/\\hbar$.\n", "  We describe a Fourier transform spectroscopy technique for directly measuring\nband structures, and apply it to a spin-1 spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. In our technique, we suddenly change the Hamiltonian of the system\nby adding a spin-orbit coupling interaction and measure populations in\ndifferent spin states during the subsequent unitary evolution. We then\nreconstruct the spin and momentum resolved spectrum from the peak frequencies\nof the Fourier transformed populations. In addition, by periodically modulating\nthe Hamiltonian, we tune the spin-orbit coupling strength and use our\nspectroscopy technique to probe the resulting dispersion relation. The\nfrequency resolution of our method is limited only by the coherent evolution\ntimescale of the Hamiltonian and can otherwise be applied to any system, for\nexample, to measure the band structure of atoms in optical lattice potentials.\n", "  We study rare radiative leptonic decays $B_{(s)}\\to e^+e^-\\gamma$ and\n$B_{(s)}\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma$ within relativistic quark model. In addition to\nprevious analysis we give the estimations of the branching ratios for four\nvalues of the minimal photon energy, which correspond to photon selection\ncriteria of the Belle and LHCb detectors. We find out that the branching ratios\nonly slightly change. The highest values corresponding to $E^\\gamma_{min}=80\n\\textrm{MeV}$ are ${\\cal B}(\\bar B^0_s\\to e^+e^-\\gamma)=18.5\\times10^{-9}$ and\n${\\cal B}(B^0_s\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma)=11.9\\times10^{-9}$. We present the\ndistribution of the forward-backward asymmetry.\n", "  We propose gravitational microlensing as a way of testing the emergent\ngravity theory recently proposed by Eric Verlinde~\\cite{Verlinde:2016toy}. We\nconsider two limiting cases: the dark mass of maximally anisotropic pressures\n(Case I) and of isotropic pressures (Case II). Our analysis of perihelion\nadvancement of a planet shows that only Case I yields a viable theory. In this\ncase the metric outside a star of mass $M_*$ can be modeled by that of a\npoint-like global monopole whose mass is $M_*$ and a deficit angle $\\Delta =\n\\sqrt{(2GH_0M_*)/(3c^3)}$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble rate and $G$ the Newton\nconstant. This deficit angle can be used to test the theory since light\nexhibits additional bending around stars given by, $\\alpha_D\\approx\n-\\pi\\Delta/2$. This angle is independent on the distance from the star and it\naffects equally light and massive particles. The effect is too small to be\nmeasurable today, but should be within reach of the next generation of high\nresolution telescopes. Finally we note that the advancement of periastron of a\nplanet orbiting around a star or black hole, which equals $\\pi\\Delta$ per\nperiod, can be also used to test the theory.\n", "  The neutron spin is a critical degree of freedom for many precision\nmeasurements using low-energy neutrons. Fundamental symmetries and interactions\ncan be studied using polarized neutrons. Parity-violation (PV) in the hadronic\nweak interaction and the search for exotic forces that depend on the relative\nspin and velocity, are two questions of fundamental physics that can be studied\nvia the neutron spin rotations that arise from the interaction of polarized\ncold neutrons and unpolarized matter. The Neutron Spin Rotation (NSR)\ncollaboration developed a neutron polarimeter, capable of determining neutron\nspin rotations of the order of $10^{-7}$ rad per meter of traversed material.\nThis paper describes two key components of the NSR apparatus, responsible for\nthe transport and manipulation of the spin of the neutrons before and after the\ntarget region, which is surrounded by magnetic shielding and where residual\nmagnetic fields need to be below 100 \\textmu G. These magnetic field devices,\ncalled input and output coils, provide the magnetic field for adiabatic\ntransport of the neutron spin in the regions outside the magnetic shielding\nwhile producing a sharp nonadiabatic transition of the neutron spin when\nentering/exiting the low-magnetic-field region. In addition, the coils are self\ncontained, forcing the return magnetic flux into a compact region of space to\nminimize fringe fields outside. The design of the input and output coil is\nbased on the magnetic scalar potential method.\n", "  The planet-forming region of protoplanetary disks is cold, dense, and\ntherefore weakly ionized. For this reason, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence\nis thought to be mostly absent, and another mechanism has to be found to\nexplain gas accretion. It has been proposed that magnetized winds, launched\nfrom the ionized disk surface, could drive accretion in the presence of a\nlarge-scale magnetic field. The efficiency and the impact of these surface\nwinds on the disk structure is still highly uncertain. We present the first\nglobal simulations of a weakly ionized disk that exhibits large-scale\nmagnetized winds. We also study the impact of self-organization, which was\npreviously demonstrated only in non-stratified models. We perform numerical\nsimulations of stratified disks with the PLUTO code. We compute the ionization\nfraction dynamically, and account for all three non-ideal MHD effects: ohmic\nand ambipolar diffusions, and the Hall drift. Simplified heating and cooling\ndue to non-thermal radiation is also taken into account in the disk atmosphere.\nWe find that disks can be accreting or not, depending on the configuration of\nthe large-scale magnetic field. Magnetothermal winds, driven both by magnetic\nacceleration and heating of the atmosphere, are obtained in the accreting case.\nIn some cases, these winds are asymmetric, ejecting predominantly on one side\nof the disk. The wind mass loss rate depends primarily on the average ratio of\nmagnetic to thermal pressure in the disk midplane. The non-accreting case is\ncharacterized by a meridional circulation, with accretion layers at the disk\nsurface and decretion in the midplane. Finally, we observe self-organization,\nresulting in axisymmetric rings of density and associated pressure \"bumps\". The\nunderlying mechanism and its impact on observable structures are discussed.\n", "  TaTe2 is a quasi-2D charge density wave (CDW) compound with distorted-1T type\nstructure exhibiting double-zigzag chains. Here we report the Fermi surface\ntopology of low temperature phase of TaTe2 (LT-TaTe2) by anisotropic\nmagneto-transport and magnetic measurements on high-quality single crystals. An\nanomalous large linear magnetoresistance up to 140% at 3 K in 9 T was observed,\nsuggesting the existence of a small Fermi pocket in Dirac cone state in quantum\ntransport models. Meanwhile, strong magnetic anisotropy was observed for B\n(001) and B//(001). Angle-dependent magnetoresistance and de Hass-van Alphen\noscillations suggest the anisotropy of the normal Fermi surface and the small\nFermi pocket in Dirac cone state.\n", "  A new combinatorial vector space measurement model is introduced for soft QCD\ndiffraction. The model independent mathematical construction resolves\nexperimental complications; the theoretical framework of the approach includes\nthe Good-Walker view of diffraction, Regge phenomenology together with AGK\ncutting rules and random fluctuations.\n", "  We study particle production at the end of inflation in kinetically driven\nG-inflation model and show that, in spite of the fact that there are no\ninflaton oscillations and hence no parametric resonance instabilities, the\nproduction of matter particles due to a coupling to the evolving inflaton field\ncan be more efficient than pure gravitational Parker particle production.\n", "  Self-assembly and dynamical properties of Janus nanoparticles have been\nstudied by molecular dynamic simulations. The nanoparticles are modeled as\ndimers and they are confined between two flat parallel plates to simulate a\nthin film. One monomer from the dumbbells interacts by a standard Lennard Jones\npotential and the other by a two-length scales shoulder potential, typically\nused for anomalous fluids. Here, we study the effects of remove the Brownian\neffects, typical from colloidal systems immersed in aqueous solution, and\nconsider a molecular system, without the drag force and the random collisions\nfrom the Brownian motion. Self-assembly and diffusion anomaly are preserved in\nrelation to the Brownian system. Additionally, a superdiffusive regime\nassociated to a collective reorientation in a highly structured phase is\nobserved. Diffusion anomaly and anomalous diffusion are explained in the two\nlength scale framework.\n", "  The light yield and the time resolution of different types of 3 m long\nscintillating bars instrumented with wavelength shifting fibres and read out by\ndifferent models of silicon photomultipliers have been measured at a test beam\nat the T9 area at the CERN Proton Synchrotron. The results obtained with\ndifferent configurations are presented. A time resolution better than 800 ps,\nconstant along the bar length within 20%, and a light yield of ~ 140 (70)\nphotoelectrons are obtained for bars 3 m long, 4.5 (5) cm wide and 2 (0.7) cm\nthick. These results nicely match the requirements for the Muon Detector of the\nSHiP experiment.\n", "  Negative searches for permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) heavily\nconstrain models of baryogenesis utilising various higher dimensional charge\nand parity violating (CPV) operators. Using effective field theory, we create a\nmodel independent connection between these EDM constraints and the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe (BAU) produced during a strongly first order\nelectroweak phase transition. The thermal aspects of the high scale physics\ndriving the phase transition are paramaterised by the usual kink solution for\nthe bubble wall profile. We find that operators involving derivatives of the\nHiggs field yield CPV contributions to the BAU containing derivatives of the\nHiggs vev, while non-derivative operators lack such contributions.\nConsequently, derivative operators cannot be eliminated in terms of\nnon-derivative operators (via the equations of motion) if one is agnostic to\nthe new physics that leads to the phase transition. Thus, we re-classify the\nindependent dimension six operators, restricting ourselves to third generation\nquarks, gauge bosons and the Higgs. Finally, we calculate the BAU (as a\nfunction of the bubble wall width and the cutoff) for a derivative and a\nnon-derivative operator, and relate it to the EDM constraints.\n", "  We consider a model of weakly interacting, close-packed, dimers on the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice. In a previous paper, we computed both the\nmultipoint dimer correlations, which display non-trivial critical exponents,\ncontinuously varying with the interaction strength; and the height\nfluctuations, which, after proper coarse graining and rescaling, converge to\nthe massless Gaussian field with a suitable interaction-dependent pre-factor\n(`amplitude'). In this paper, we prove the identity between the critical\nexponent of the two-point dimer correlation and the amplitude of this massless\nGaussian field. This identity is the restatement, in the context of interacting\ndimers, of one of the Haldane universality relations, part of his Luttinger\nliquid conjecture, originally formulated in the context of one-dimensional\ninteracting Fermi systems. Its validity is a strong confirmation of the\neffective massless Gaussian field description of the interacting dimer model,\nwhich was guessed on the basis of formal bosonization arguments. We also\nconjecture that a certain discrete curve defined at the lattice level via the\nTemperley bijection converges in the scaling limit to an SLE$_\\kappa$ process,\nwith $\\kappa$ depending non-trivially on the interaction and related in a\nsimple way to the amplitude of the limiting Gaussian field.\n", "  While the statistical and resilience properties of the Internet are no more\nchanging significantly across time, the Darknet, a network devoted to keep\nanonymous its traffic, still experiences rapid changes to improve the security\nof its users. Here, we study the structure of the Darknet and we find that its\ntopology is rather peculiar, being characterized by non-homogenous distribution\nof connections -- typical of scale-free networks --, very short path lengths\nand high clustering -- typical of small-world networks -- and lack of a core of\nhighly connected nodes.\n  We propose a model to reproduce such features, demonstrating that the\nmechanisms used to improve cyber-security are responsible for the observed\ntopology. Unexpectedly, we reveal that its peculiar structure makes the Darknet\nmuch more resilient than the Internet -- used as a benchmark for comparison at\na descriptive level -- to random failures, targeted attacks and cascade\nfailures, as a result of adaptive changes in response to the attempts of\ndismantling the network across time.\n", "  In this article, we present a one-field monolithic fictitious domain (FD)\nmethod for simulation of general fluid-structure interactions (FSI). One-field\nmeans only one velocity field is solved in the whole domain, based upon the use\nof an appropriate L2 projection. Monolithic means the fluid and solid equations\nare solved synchronously (rather than sequentially). We argue that the proposed\nmethod has the same generality and robustness as FD methods with distributed\nLagrange multiplier (DLM) but is significantly more computationally efficient\n(because of one-field) whilst being very straightforward to implement. The\nmethod is described in detail, followed by the presentation of multiple\ncomputational examples in order to validate it across a wide range of fluid and\nsolid parameters and interactions.\n", "  We report correlation measurements on two $^9$Be$^+$ ions that violate a\nchained Bell inequality obeyed by any local-realistic theory. The correlations\ncan be modeled as derived from a mixture of a local-realistic probabilistic\ndistribution and a distribution that violates the inequality. A statistical\nframework is formulated to quantify the local-realistic fraction allowable in\nthe observed distribution without the fair-sampling or\nindependent-and-identical-distributions assumptions. We exclude models of our\nexperiment whose local-realistic fraction is above 0.327 at the 95 \\%\nconfidence level. This bound is significantly lower than 0.586, the minimum\nfraction derived from a perfect Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality\nexperiment. Furthermore, our data provides a device-independent certification\nof the deterministically created Bell states.\n", "  We identify a new contribution to the chiral magnetic conductivity at finite\nfrequencies -- the magnetization current. This allows to quantitatively\nreproduce the known field-theoretic time-dependent (AC) chiral magnetic\nresponse in terms of kinetic theory. We evaluate the corresponding AC chiral\nmagnetic conductivity in two flavor QCD plasma at weak coupling. The\nmagnetization current results from the spin response of chiral quasiparticles\nto magnetic field, and is thus proportional to the quasiparticle's $g$-factor.\nIn condensed matter systems, where the chiral quasi-particles are emergent and\nthe $g$-factor can significantly differ from 2, this opens the possibility to\ntune the AC chiral magnetic response.\n", "  We calculate the multipoint Green functions in 1+1 dimensional integrable\nquantum field theories. We use the crossing formula for general models and\ncalculate the 3 and 4 point functions taking in to account only the lower\nnontrivial intermediate states contributions. Then we apply the general results\nto the examples of the scaling $Z_{2}$ Ising model, sinh-Gordon model and\n$Z_{3}$ scaling Ising model. We demonstrate this calculations explicitly. The\nresults can be applied to physical phenomena as for example to the Raman\nscattering.\n", "  The Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) coupling $\\alpha_s$ is a central parameter\nin the Standard Model of particle physics. However, it depends on theoretical\nconventions related to renormalisation and hence is not an observable quantity.\nIn order to capture this dependence in a transparent way, a novel definition of\nthe QCD coupling, denoted by $\\hat a$, is introduced, whose running is\nexplicitly renormalisation scheme invariant. The remaining renormalisation\nscheme dependence is related to transformations of the QCD scale $\\Lambda$, and\ncan be parametrised by a single parameter $C$. Hence, we call $\\hat a$ the\n$C$-scheme coupling. The dependence on $C$ can be exploited to study and\nimprove perturbative predictions of physical observables. This is demonstrated\nfor the QCD Adler function and hadronic decays of the $\\tau$ lepton.\n", "  Recommender systems play an essential role in the modern business world. They\nrecommend favorable items like books, movies, and search queries to users based\non their past preferences. Applying similar ideas and techniques to Monte Carlo\nsimulations of physical systems boosts their efficiency without sacrificing\naccuracy. Exploiting the quantum to classical mapping inherent in the\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods, we construct a classical molecular\ngas model to reproduce the quantum distributions. We then utilize powerful\nmolecular simulation techniques to propose efficient quantum Monte Carlo\nupdates. The recommender engine approach provides a general way to speed up the\nquantum impurity solvers.\n", "  The arrival directions of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are highly isotropic.\nThis is expected from the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in our Galactic\nenvironment that repeatedly scatter charged CRs during propagation. However,\nvarious CR observatories have identified weak anisotropies of various angular\nsizes and with relative intensities of up to a level of 1 part in 1,000.\nWhereas large-scale anisotropies are generally predicted by standard diffusion\nmodels, the appearance of small-scale anisotropies down to an angular size of\n10 degrees is surprising. In this review, we summarise the current experimental\nsituation for both the large-scale and small-scale anisotropies. We address\nsome of the issues in comparing different experimental results and remaining\nquestions in interpreting the observed large-scale anisotropies. We then review\nthe standard diffusive picture and its difficulty in producing the small-scale\nanisotropies. Having set the stage, we review the various ideas and models put\nforward for explaining the small-scale anisotropies.\n", "  In this letter, we describe a very general procedure to obtain a causal fit\nof the permittivity of materials from experimental data with very few\nparameters. Unlike other closed forms proposed in the literature, the\nparticularity of this approach lies in its independence towards the material or\nfrequency range at stake. Many illustrative numerical examples are given and\nthe accuracy of the fitting is compared to other expressions in the literature.\n", "  We investigate a new class of scalar multi-galileon models, which is not\nincluded in the commonly admitted general formulation of generalized\nmulti-galileons. The Lagrangians of this class of models, some of them having\nalready been introduced in previous works, are specific to multi-galileon\ntheories, and vanish in the single galileon case. We examine them in details,\ndiscussing in particular some hidden symmetry properties which can be made\nexplicit by adding total derivatives to these Lagrangians. These properties\nallow us to describe the possible dynamics for these new Lagrangians in the\ncase of multi-galileons in the fundamental representation of a SO(N) and SU(N)\nglobal symmetry group, as well as in the adjoint representation of a SU(N)\nglobal symmetry group. We perform in parallel an exhaustive examination of some\nof these models, finding a complete agreement with the dynamics obtained using\nthe symmetry properties. Finally, we conclude by discussing what could be the\nmost general multi-galileon theory, as well as the link between scalar and\nvector multi-galileon models.\n", "  Precision tests of QCD perturbation theory are not readily available from\nexperimental data. The main reasons are systematic uncertainties due to the\nconfinement of quarks and gluons, as well as kinematical constraints which\nlimit the accessible energy scales. We here show how continuum extrapolated\nlattice data may overcome such problems and provide excellent probes of\nrenormalized perturbation theory. This work corresponds to an essential step in\nthe ALPHA collaboration's project to determine the $\\Lambda$-parameter in\n3-flavour QCD. I explain the basic techniques used in the high energy regime,\nnamely the use of mass-independent renormalization schemes for the QCD coupling\nconstant in a finite Euclidean space time volume. When combined with finite\nsize techniques this allows one to iteratively step up the energy scale by\nfactors of 2, thereby quickly covering two orders of magnitude in scale. We may\nthen compare perturbation theory (with $\\beta$-functions available up to 3-loop\norder) to our non-perturbative data for a 1-parameter family of running\ncouplings. We conclude that a target precision of 3 percent for the\n$\\Lambda$-parameter requires non-perturbative data up to scales where\n$\\alpha_s\\approx 0.1$, whereas the apparent precision obtained from applying\nperturbation theory around $\\alpha_s \\approx 0.2$ can be misleading. This\nshould be taken as a general warning to practitioners of QCD perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  The starspots on the surface of many chromospherically active binary stars\nconcentrate on long--lived active longitudes separated by 180 degrees. The\nactivity shifts between these two longitudes, the \"flip-flop\" events, have been\nobserved in single stars like FK Comae and binary stars like $\\sigma$\nGeminorum. Recently, interferometry has revealed that ellipticity may at least\npartly explain the \"flip-flop\" events in $\\sigma$ Geminorum. This idea was\nsupported by the double peaked shape of the long--term mean light curve of this\nstar. Here, we show that the long--term mean light curves of fourteen\nchromospherically active binaries follow a general model which explains the\nconnection betweenm orbital motion, starspot distribution changes, ellipticity\nand \\flip ~events. Surface differential rotation is probably weak in these\nstars, because the interference of two constant period waves may explain the\nobserved light curve changes. These two constant periods are the active\nlongitude period $(P_{\\mathrm{act}})$ and the orbital period\n$(P_{\\mathrm{orb}})$. We also show how to apply the same model to single stars,\nwhere only the value of $P_{\\mathrm{act}}$ is known. Finally, we present a\ntentative interference hypothesis about the origin of magnetic fields in all\nspectral types of stars.\n", "  The interaction of ultrashort, high intensity laser pulses with thin foil\ntargets leads to ion acceleration on the target rear surface. To make this ion\nsource useful for applications, it is important to optimize the transfer of\nenergy from the laser into the accelerated ions. One of the most promising ways\nto achieve this consists in engineering the target front by introducing\nperiodic nanostructures.\n  In this paper, the effect of these structures on ion acceleration is studied\nanalytically and with multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We\nassessed the role of the structure shape, size, and the angle of laser\nincidence for obtaining the efficient energy transfer. Local control of\nelectron trajectories is exploited to maximise the energy delivered into the\ntarget. Based on our numerical simulations, we propose a precise range of\nparameters for fabrication of nanostructured targets, which can increase the\nenergy of the accelerated ions without requiring a higher laser intensity.\n", "  In this issue we demonstrate the very inspiring role of the continuous-time\nrandom walk (CTRW) formalism and its numerous modifications thanks to their\nflexibility and various applications as well its promising perspectives in\ndifferent fields of knowledge. A short review of significant achievements and\npossibilities is given, however, still far from completeness.\n", "  The magnetostatic mode (MSM) spectrum of a 300$\\mu$m diameter single\ncrystalline sphere of yttrium iron garnet is investigated using broadband\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The individual MSMs are identified via their\ncharacteristic dispersion relations and the corresponding mode number tuples\n$(nmr)$ are assigned. Taking FMR data over a broad frequency and magnetic field\nrange allows to analyze both the Gilbert damping parameter~$\\alpha$ and the\ninhomogeneous line broadening contribution to the total linewidth of the MSMs\nseparately. The linewidth analysis shows that all MSMs share the same Gilbert\ndamping parameter $\\alpha=2.7(5) \\times 10^{-5}$ irrespective of their mode\nindex. In contrast, the inhomogeneous line broadening shows a pronounced mode\ndependence. This observation is modeled in terms of two-magnon scattering\nprocesses of the MSMs into the spin-wave manifold, mediated by surface and\nvolume defects.\n", "  We present a review of the different aspects associated with the interaction\nof successive CMEs in the corona and inner heliosphere, focusing on the\ninitiation of series of CMEs, their interaction in the heliosphere, the\nparticle acceleration associated with successive CMEs, and the effect of\ncompound events on Earth's magnetosphere. The two main mechanisms resulting in\nthe eruption of series of CMEs are sympathetic eruptions and homologous\neruptions. The interaction of successive CMEs has been observed remotely in\ncoronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and inferred from in situ measurements.\nIt is associated with magnetic reconnection, momentum exchange, the propagation\nof a fast magnetosonic shock through a magnetic ejecta and changes in CME\nexpansion. The presence of a CME a few hours before a fast eruption is\nconnected with higher fluxes of SEPs, while CME-CME interaction occurring in\nthe corona is often associated with unusual radio bursts. Higher suprathermal\npopulation, enhanced turbulence and wave activity, stronger shocks, and\nshock-shock or shock-CME interaction have been proposed as physical mechanisms\nto explain these SEP events. When measured in situ, CME-CME interaction may be\nassociated with relatively well organized multiple-magnetic cloud events,\ninstances of shocks propagating through a previous magnetic ejecta or more\ncomplex ejecta. The compression of a CME by another and the propagation of a\nshock inside a magnetic ejecta can lead to extreme values of the southward\nmagnetic field, sometimes associated with large values of the dynamic pressure.\nThis can result in intense geomagnetic storms, but also trigger substorms and\nlarge earthward motions of the magnetopause, potentially associated with\nchanges in the outer radiation belts. Future measurements by Solar Probe+ and\nSolar Orbiter may shed light on the evolution of CMEs as they interact.\n", "  We study the prethermal dynamics of an interacting quantum field theory with\na N-component order parameter and $O(N)$ symmetry, suddenly quenched in the\nvicinity of a dynamical critical point. Depending on the initial conditions,\nthe evolution of the order parameter, and of the response and correlation\nfunctions, can exhibit a temporal crossover between universal dynamical scaling\nregimes governed, respectively, by a quantum and a classical prethermal fixed\npoint, as well as a crossover from a Gaussian to a non-Gaussian prethermal\ndynamical scaling. Together with a recent experiment, this suggests that\nquenches may be used in order to explore the rich variety of dynamical critical\npoints occurring in the non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum many-body system.\nWe illustrate this fact by using a combination of renormalization group\ntechniques and a non-perturbative large-$N$ limit.\n", "  After a successful core-collapse supernova, a neutrino-driven wind develops\nwhere it is possible to synthesize lighter heavy elements ($30<Z<45$). In the\nearly galaxy, the origin of these elements is associated to the r-process and\nto an additional process. Here we assume the additional process corresponds to\nthe weak r-process or alpha-process taking place in neutrino-driven winds.\nBased on a trajectory obtained from hydrodynamical simulations we study the\nastrophysics and nuclear physics uncertainties with our main focus on the\n$(\\alpha,n)$ reactions. These are critical to redistribute the matter and allow\nto further move it from light to heavy elements after nuclear statistical\nequilibrium freezes out. In this first sensitivity study, we vary all\n$(\\alpha,n)$ reactions by given constant factors which are justified based on\nthe uncertainties of the statistical model and its nuclear physics input,\nmainly alpha optical potentials under the conditions found in the wind. Our\nresults show that $(\\alpha,n)$ reactions are indeed very important to predict\nabundances. Therefore, further studies will follow to identify individual\ncritical reactions. Since the nucleosynthesis path is close to stability, these\nreactions can be measured in the near future. This will uniquely allow to\nreduce the nuclear physics uncertainties and thus to use observations to\nconstrain and understand the astrophysical conditions in the wind.\n", "  Spatial division multiplexing utilizes the directionality of lights\npropagating k-vector to separate it into distinct spatial directions. Here we\nshow that the anisotropy of orthogonal spatial Solitons propagating in a single\nGraphene monolayer results in phase-based multiplexing. We use the self-\nconfinement properties of spatial Solitons to increase the usable density of\nstates (DOS) of this switching-system. Furthermore, we show that crossing two\northogonal Solitons exhibit a low (0.035 dB) mutual disturbance from another\nenabling independent k-vector switching. The efficient utilization of the DOS\nand multiplexing in real-space enables data processing parallelism with\napplications in optical networking and computing.\n", "  The Formation of metastable molecules (Feshbach resonances) at the collision\nof two atoms and subsequent stimulated transition to a lower unbound electronic\nmolecular state, with emission of a photon of the laser radiation has been\ninvestigated. This can develop, in particular, for $Rb_2$ molecules due to\nresonance scattering of two $Rb$ atoms. The considered process is a basis for\nthe creation of excimer lasers. Expressions for the cross sections of elastic\nand inelastic resonance scattering and the intensity of the stimulated emission\nof the photons have been obtained.\n", "  Towards the end of LHC Run1, gas leaks were observed in some parts of the\nTransition Radiation Tracker (TRT) of ATLAS. Due to these leaks, primary Xenon\nbased gas mixture was replaced with Argon based mixture in various parts.\nTest-beam studies with a dedicated Transition Radiation Detector (TRD)\nprototype were carried out in 2015 in order to understand transition radiation\nperformance with mixtures based on Argon and Krypton. We present and discuss\nthe results of these test-beam studies with different active gas compositions.\n", "  Amorphous solids are ubiquitous among natural and man-made materials. Often\nused as structural materials for their attractive mechanical properties, their\nutility depends critically on their response to applied stresses. Processes\nunderlying such mechanical response, and in particular the yielding behaviour\nof amorphous solids, are not satisfactorily understood. Although studied\nextensively[1-14], observed yielding behaviour can be gradual and depend\nsignificantly on conditions of study, making it difficult to convincingly\nvalidate existing theoretical descriptions of a sharp yielding transition[4, 6,\n8, 13, 15]. Here, we employ oscillatory deformation as a reliable probe of the\nyielding transition. Through extensive computer simulations for a wide range of\nsystem sizes, we demonstrate that cyclically deformed model glasses exhibit a\nsharply defined yielding transition with characteristics that are independent\nof preparation history. In contrast to prevailing expectations[4, 8, 12], the\nstatistics of avalanches reveals no signature of the impending transition, but\nexhibit dramatic, qualitative, changes in character across the transition.\n", "  An approach to QCD vacuum as a medium describable in terms of statistical\nensemble of almost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual gluon fields\nis reviewed. These fields play the role of the confining medium for color\ncharged fields as well as underline the mechanism of realization of chiral\n$SU_{\\mathrm L}(N_f)\\times SU_{\\mathrm R}(N_f)$ and $U_{\\mathrm A}(1)$\nsymmetries. Hadronization formalism based on this ensemble leads to manifestly\ndefined quantum effective meson action. Strong, electromagnetic and weak\ninteractions of mesons are represented in the action in terms of nonlocal\n$n$-point interaction vertices given by the quark-gluon loops averaged over the\nbackground ensemble. Systematic results for the mass spectrum and decay\nconstants of radially excited light, heavy-light mesons and heavy quarkonia are\npresented. Relationship of this approach to the results of functional\nrenormalization group and Dyson-Schwinger equations, and the picture of\nharmonic confinement is briefly outlined.\n", "  Electrical currents at the surface or edge of a topological insulator are\nintrinsically spin-polarized. We show that such surface/edge currents can be\nused to switch the orientation of a molecular magnet weakly coupled to the\nsurface or edge of a topological insulator. For the edge of a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator as well as for the surface of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator the application of a well-chosen surface/edge current can\nlead to a complete polarization of the molecule if the molecule's magnetic\nanisotropy axis is appropriately aligned with the current direction. For a\ngeneric orientation of the molecule a nonzero but incomplete polarization is\nobtained. We calculate the probability distribution of the magnetic states and\nthe switching rates as a function of the applied current.\n", "  We present a re-calibration of the $M_{BH}-\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation, based on\na sample of 16 reverberation-mapped galaxies with newly determined bulge\nstellar velocity dispersions ($\\sigma_{\\star}$) from integral-field\nspectroscopy (IFS), and a sample of 32 quiescent galaxies with publicly\navailable IFS. For both samples, $\\sigma_{\\star}$ is determined via two\ndifferent methods that are popular in the literature, and we provide fits for\neach sample based on both sets of $\\sigma_{\\star}$. We find the fit to the AGN\nsample is shallower than the fit to the quiescent galaxy sample, and that the\nslopes for each sample are in agreement with previous investigations. However,\nthe intercepts to the quiescent galaxy relations are notably higher than those\nfound in previous studies, due to the systematically lower $\\sigma_{\\star}$\nmeasurements that we obtain from IFS. We find that this may be driven, in part,\nby poorly constrained measurements of bulge effective radius ($r_{e}$) for the\nquiescent galaxy sample, which may bias the $\\sigma_{\\star}$ measurements low.\nWe use these quiescent galaxy parameterizations, as well as one from the\nliterature, to recalculate the virial scaling factor $f$. We assess the\npotential biases in each measurement, and suggest $f=4.82\\pm1.67$ as the best\ncurrently available estimate. However, we caution that the details of how\n$\\sigma_{\\star}$ is measured can significantly affect $f$, and there is still\nmuch room for improvement.\n", "  Operating conditions and challenging demands of present and future\naccelerator experiments result in new requirements on detector systems. There\nare many ongoing activities aimed to develop new technologies and to improve\nthe properties of detectors based on existing technologies. Our work is\ndedicated to development of Transition Radiation Detectors (TRD) suitable for\ndifferent applications. In this paper results obtained in beam tests at SPS\naccelerator at CERN with the TRD prototype based on straw technology are\npresented. TRD performance was studied as a function of thickness of the\ntransition radiation radiator and working gas mixture pressure.\n", "  We investigate the spin-orbit coupling effect in a two-dimensional Wigner\ncrystal. We show that sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling and an\nappropriate sign of g-factor could transform the Wigner crystal to a\ntopological phonon system. We demonstrate the existence of chiral phonon edge\nmodes in finite size samples, as well as the robustness of the modes in the\ntopological phase. We explore the possibility of realizing the topological\nphonon system in two-dimensional Wigner crystals confined in semiconductor\nquantum wells/heterostructure. We find that the spin-orbit coupling is too weak\nfor driving a topological phase transition in these systems. We argue that one\nmay look for the topological phonon system in correlated Wigner crystals with\nemergent effective spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Silicon carbide is a promising platform for single photon sources, quantum\nbits (qubits) and nanoscale sensors based on individual color centers. Towards\nthis goal, we develop a scalable array of nanopillars incorporating single\nsilicon vacancy centers in 4H-SiC, readily available for efficient interfacing\nwith free-space objective and lensed-fibers. A commercially obtained substrate\nis irradiated with 2 MeV electron beams to create vacancies. Subsequent\nlithographic process forms 800 nm tall nanopillars with 400-1,400 nm diameters.\nWe obtain high collection efficiency, up to 22 kcounts/s optical saturation\nrates from a single silicon vacancy center, while preserving the single photon\nemission and the optically induced electron-spin polarization properties. Our\nstudy demonstrates silicon carbide as a readily available platform for scalable\nquantum photonics architecture relying on single photon sources and qubits.\n", "  We discuss the leading-logarithmic power corrections in the $N$-jettiness\nsubtraction scheme for higher-order perturbative QCD calculations. We compute\nthe next-to-leading order power corrections for an arbitrary $N$-jet process,\nand we explicitly calculate the power correction through\nnext-to-next-to-leading order for color-singlet production for both $q\\bar{q}$\nand $gg$ initiated processes. Our results are compact and simple to implement\nnumerically. Including the leading power correction in the $N$-jettiness\nsubtraction scheme substantially improves its numerical efficiency. We discuss\nwhat features of our techniques extend to processes containing final-state\njets.\n", "  The nn final state interaction has been investigated in\nd+2H->(pp)S+(nn)S->p+p+n+n reaction going through a formation and breakup of\nsinglet diproton and dineutron in the intermediate state. In the kinematically\ncomplete experiment performed at Ed =15 MeV two proton and neutron were\ndetected at angles close to those of emission of (pp)S and (nn)S systems.\nSimulation of the reaction showed that the shape of neutron energy (timing)\nspectrum depends on epsnn - the energy of virtual 1S0 state of nn-system. The\nmost likely value epsnn = 0.076 +/- 0.006 MeV was obtained by fitting procedure\nusing the experimental data and simulations. This low value of epsnn evidently\nindicates on effective enhancement of nn-interaction in the intermediate state\nof studied reaction\n", "  In preparation for the upcoming all-sky data releases of the Gaia mission we\ncompiled a catalogue of known hot subdwarf stars and candidates drawn from the\nliterature and yet unpublished databases. The catalogue contains 5613 unique\nsources and provides multi-band photometry from the ultraviolet to the far\ninfrared, ground based proper motions, classifications based on spectroscopy\nand colours, published atmospheric parameters, radial velocities and light\ncurve variability information. Using several different techniques we removed\noutliers and misclassified objects. By matching this catalogue with astrometric\nand photometric data from the Gaia mission, we will develop selection criteria\nto construct a homogeneous, magnitude-limited all-sky catalogue of hot subdwarf\nstars based on Gaia data.\n", "  We numerically examine clogging transitions for bidisperse disks flowing\nthrough a two dimensional periodic obstacle array. We show that clogging is a\nprobabilistic event that occurs through a transition from a homogeneous flowing\nstate to a heterogeneous or phase separated jammed state where the disks form\ndense connected clusters. The probability for clogging to occur during a fixed\ntime increases with increasing particle packing and obstacle number. For\ndriving at different angles with respect to the symmetry direction of the\nobstacle array, we show that certain directions have a higher clogging\nsusceptibility. It is also possible to have a size-specific clogging transition\nin which one disk size becomes completely immobile while the other disk size\ncontinues to flow.\n", "  Experiments and atomic-scale simulations suggest that the transmission of\nplasticity carriers in deforming amorphous-crystalline nanolaminates is\nmediated by the biphase interface between the amorphous and crystalline layers.\nIn this paper, we present a micromechanics model for these biphase\nnanolaminates that describes defect interactions through the\namorphous-crystalline interface (ACI). The model is based on an\neffective-temperature framework to achieve a unified description of the slow,\nconfigurational atomic rearrangements in both phases when driven out of\nequilibrium. We show how the second law of thermodynamics constrains the\ndensity of defects and the rate of configurational rearrangements, and apply\nthis framework to dislocations in crystalline solids and shear transformation\nzones (STZs) in amorphous materials. The effective-temperature formulation\nenables us to interpret the observed movement of dislocations to the ACI and\nthe production of STZs at the interface as a \"diffusion\" of configurational\ndisorder across the material. We demonstrate favorable agreement with\nexperimental findings reported in (Kim et al., Adv. Funct. Mater., 2011), and\ndemonstrate how the ACI acts as a sink of dislocations and a source of STZs.\n", "  The properties of matter at finite baryon densities play an important role\nfor the astrophysics of compact stars as well as for heavy ion collisions or\nthe description of nuclear matter. Because of the sign problem of the quark\ndeterminant, lattice QCD cannot be simulated by standard Monte Carlo at finite\nbaryon densities. I review alternative attempts to treat dense QCD with an\neffective lattice theory derived by analytic strong coupling and hopping\nexpansions, which close to the continuum is valid for heavy quarks only, but\nshows all qualitative features of nuclear physics emerging from QCD. In\nparticular, the nuclear liquid gas transition and an equation of state for\nbaryons can be calculated directly from QCD. A second effective theory based on\nstrong coupling methods permits studies of the phase diagram in the chiral\nlimit on coarse lattices.\n", "  Thermoresponsive polymer architectures have become integral building blocks\nof 'smart' functional materials in modern applications. For a large range of\ndevelopments, e.g., for drug delivery or nanocatalytic carrier systems, the\nselective adsorption and partitioning of molecules (ligands or reactants)\ninside the polymeric matrix are key processes that have to be controlled and\ntuned for the desired material function. In order to gain insights into the\nnanoscale structure and binding details in such systems, we here employ\nmolecular dynamics simulations of the popular poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)\n(PNIPAM) polymer in explicit water in the presence of various representative\nsolute types with focus on aromatic model reactants. We model a PNIPAM polymer\nchain and explore the influence of its elongation, stereochemistry, and\ntemperature on the solute binding affinities. While we find that the excess\nadsorption generally raises with the size of the solute, the temperature-\ndependent affinity to the chains is highly solute specific and has a\nconsiderable dependence on the polymer elongation (i.e., polymer swelling\nstate). We elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the selective binding in\ndetail and eventually present how the results can be extrapolated to\nmacroscopic partitioning of the solutes in swollen polymer architectures, such\nas hydrogels.\n", "  There is a discrepancy between light-front and equal-time values for the\ncritical coupling of two-dimensional $\\phi^4$ theory. A proposed resolution is\nto take into account the difference between mass renormalizations in the two\nquantizations. This distinction was first discussed by M. Burkardt. It prevents\ndirect comparison of bare parameters; however, a method proposed here allows\ncalculation of the difference and thereby resolves the discrepancy. We also\nconsider the consequences of allowing a sector-dependent constituent mass.\n", "  We start from the observation that, in the confining phase of QCD, the\ninstantaneous color-Coulomb potential in Coulomb gauge is confining. This\nsuggests that, in the confining phase, the dynamics, as expressed in the set of\nSchwinger-Dyson equations, may be dominated by the purely instantaneous terms.\nWe develop a calculational scheme that expresses the instantaneous dynamics in\nthe local formulation of QCD that includes a cut-off at the Gribov horizon.\n", "  In this paper, we have presented the density functional theory (DFT) based\ncalculations performed within the first-principles pseudopotential method to\ninvestigate the physical properties of the newly discovered superconductor\nLaRu2As2 for the first time. The optimized structural parameters are in good\nagreement with the experimental results. The calculated independent elastic\nconstants ensure mechanical stability of the compound. The calculated Cauchy\npressure, Pugh's ratio as well as Poisson's ratio indicate that LaRu2As2 should\nbehave as a ductile material. Due to low Debye temperature, LaRu2As2 may be\nused as a thermal barrier coating (TBC) material. The new compound should\nexhibit metallic nature as its valence bands overlap considerably with the\nconduction bands. LaRu2As2 is expected to be a soft material and easily\nmachineable because of its low hardness value of 6.8 Gpa. The multi-band nature\nis observed in calculated Fermi surface. A highly anisotropic combination of\nionic, covalent, and metallic interactions is expected in accordance with\ncharge density calculations.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the set theoretical proof of Wigner for\nBell type inequalities with the following result. Wigner introduced a crucial\nassumption that is not related to Einstein's local realism, but instead,\nwithout justification, to the existence of certain joint probability measures\nfor possible and actual measurement outcomes of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nexperiments. His conclusions about Einstein's local realism are, therefore, not\napplicable to EPR experiments and the contradiction of the experimental\noutcomes to Wigner's results has no bearing on the validity of Einstein's local\nrealism.\n", "  We report investigation on quantum discord in classical second-order\ninterference. In particular, we theoretically show that a bipartite state with\nD = 0.311 of discord can be generated via classical second-order interference.\nWe also experimentally verify the theory by obtaining D = 0.197 +- 0.060 of\nnon-zero discord state. Together with the fact that non-classicalities\noriginated from physical constraints and information theoretic perspectives are\nnot equivalent, this result provides an insight to understand the nature of\nquantum discord.\n", "  Coupled oscillator networks show a complex interrelations between topological\ncharacteristics of the network and the nonlinear stability of single nodes with\nrespect to large but realistic perturbations. We extend previous results on\nthese relations by incorporating sampling-based measures of the transient\nbehaviour of the system, its survivability, as well as its asymptotic\nbehaviour, its basin stability. By combining basin stability and survivability\nwe uncover novel, previously unknown asymptotic states with solitary,\ndesynchronized oscillators which are rotating with a frequency different from\ntheir natural one. They occur almost exclusively after perturbations at nodes\nwith specific topological properties.\n  More generally we confirm and significantly refine the results on the\ndistinguished role tree-shaped appendices play for nonlinear stability. We find\na topological classification scheme for nodes located in such appendices, that\nexactly separates them according to their stability properties, thus\nestablishing a strong link between topology and dynamics. Hence, the results\ncan be used for the identification of vulnerable nodes in power grids or other\ncoupled oscillator networks. From this classification we can derive general\ndesign principles for resilient power grids. We find that striving for\nhomogeneous network topologies facilitates a better performance in terms of\nnonlinear dynamical network stability. While the employed second-order\nKuramoto-like model is parametrized to be representative for power grids, we\nexpect these insights to transfer to other critical infrastructure systems or\ncomplex network dynamics appearing in various other fields.\n", "  We construct quasi-local conserved currents in the six-vertex model with\nanisotropy parameter $\\eta$ by making use of the quantum-group approach of\nBernard and Felder. From these currents, we construct parafermionic operators\nwith spin $1+i\\eta/\\pi$ that obey a discrete-integral condition around lattice\nplaquettes embedded into the complex plane. These operators are identified with\nprimary fields in a $c=1$ compactified free Boson conformal field theory. We\nthen consider a vertex-face correspondence that takes the six-vertex model to a\ntrigonometric SOS model, and construct SOS operators that are the image of the\nsix-vertex currents under this correspondence. We define corresponding SOS\nparafermionic operators with spins $s=1$ and $s=1+2i\\eta/\\pi$ that obey\ndiscrete integral conditions around SOS plaquettes embedded into the complex\nplane. We consider in detail the cyclic-SOS case corresponding to the choice\n$\\eta=i\\pi (p-p')/p$, with $p'<p$ coprime. We identify our SOS parafermionic\noperators in terms of the screening operators and primary fields of the\nassociated $c=1-6(p-p')^2/pp'$ conformal field theory.\n", "  The nature of very low luminosity objects with the internal luminosity L_obj\n<= 0.1 Lsun is investigated by means of numerical modeling coupling the core\ncollapse simulations with the stellar evolution calculations. The gravitational\ncollapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Msun is\ninvestigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and\nterminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass\nhad been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk\nformation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,\nwhile the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a\nstellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets\nthe floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold\naccretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are\nrelatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded\nphase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Msun. (abridged).\n", "  It is usually believed that the observation of the neutrino-antineutrino\n(${\\nu}$-$\\bar{\\nu}$) oscillations is almost impossible since the oscillation\nprobabilities are expected to be greatly suppressed by the square of tiny ratio\nof neutrino masses to energies. Such an argument is applicable to most models\nfor neutrino mass generation based on the Weinberg operator, including the\nseesaw models. However, in the present paper, we shall give a counterexample to\nthis argument, and show that large $\\nu$-$\\bar{\\nu}$ oscillation probabilities\ncan be obtained in a class of models in which both neutrino masses and\nneutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decays are induced by the\nhigh-dimensional lepton number violating operator ${\\cal O}_7 = \\bar{u}_R l^c_R\n\\bar{L}_L H^*d_R + {\\rm H.c.}$ with $u$ and $d$ representing the first two\ngenerations of quarks. In particular, we find that the predicted\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay rates have already placed interesting constraints on the\n$\\nu_e \\leftrightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_e$ oscillation. Moreover, we provide an\nUV-complete model to realize this scenario, in which a dark matter candidate\nnaturally appears due to the new $U(1)_d$ symmetry.\n", "  The Hubble diagram is one of the cornerstones of observational cosmology. It\nis usually analysed assuming that, on average, the underlying relation between\nmagnitude and redshift matches the prediction of a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker model. However, the inhomogeneity of the\nUniverse generically biases these observables, mainly due to peculiar\nvelocities and gravitational lensing, in a way that depends on the notion of\naverage used in theoretical calculations. In this article, we carefully derive\nthe notion of average which corresponds to the observation of the Hubble\ndiagram. We then calculate its bias at second-order in cosmological\nperturbations, and estimate the consequences on the inference of cosmological\nparameters, for various current and future surveys. We find that this bias\ndeeply affects direct estimations of the evolution of the dark-energy equation\nof state. However, errors in the standard inference of cosmological parameters\nremain smaller than observational uncertainties, even though they reach percent\nlevel on some parameters; they reduce to sub-percent level if an optimal\ndistance indicator is used.\n", "  We study the lateral Casimir force experienced by a particle that rotates\nnear a planar surface. The origin of this force lies in the symmetry breaking\ninduced by the particle rotation in the vacuum and thermal fluctuations of its\ndipole moment, and, therefore, in contrast to lateral Casimir forces previously\ndescribed in the literature for corrugated surfaces, it exists despite the\ntranslational invariance of the planar surface. Working within the framework of\nfluctuational electrodynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the lateral\nforce and analyze its dependence on the geometrical and material properties of\nthe system. In particular, we show that the direction of the force can be\ncontrolled by adjusting the particle-surface distance, which may be exploited\nas a new mechanism to manipulate nanoscale objects.\n", "  Short period, high field undulators are used to produce hard X-rays on\nsynchrotron radiation based storage ring facilities of intermediate energy and\nenable short wavelength Free Electron Laser. Cryogenic permanent magnet\nundulators take benefit from improved magnetic properties of RE2Fe14B (Rare\nEarth based magnets) at low temperatures for achieving short period, high\nmagnetic field and high coercivity. Using Pr2Fe14B instead of Nd2Fe14B, which\nis generally employed for undulators, avoids the limitation caused by the Spin\nReorientation Transition phenomenon, and simplifies the cooling system by\nallowing the working temperature of the undulator to be directly at the liquid\nnitrogen one (77 K). We describe here the development of a full scale (2 m), 18\nmm period Pr2Fe14B cryogenic permanent magnet undulator (U18). The design,\nconstruction and optimization, as well as magnetic measurements and shimming at\nlow temperature are presented. The commissioning and operation of the undulator\nwith the electron beam and spectrum measurement using the Nanoscopmium beamline\nat SOLEIL are also reported.\n", "  Flavour physics is currently well described by the Standard Model except for\nsome measurements which could be signalling new physics. We briefly summarize\nthe status of tensions in rare exclusive semi-leptonic $B$ decays and in\n$R_{K/D^{(\\ast)}}$ ratios. We also address the issue of the long standing\ntension in the $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ exclusive/inclusive determinations.\n", "  We consider the role of the charm mass in PDF fits, and in particular the\nreliability of recent determinations of the MSbar running mass from fits to\ninclusive charm production data. We explain how the use of the pole mass, with\na charm PDF determined empirically, can reduce PDF uncertainties from charm\nmass effects, and thereby lead to more reliable predictions for hard processes\nat the LHC.\n", "  $N$-subjettiness ratios are in wide use for tagging heavy boosted objects, in\nparticular the ratio of 2-subjettiness to 1-subjettiness for tagging boosted\nelectroweak bosons. In this article we introduce a new, \\emph{dichroic} ratio,\nwhich uses different regions of a jet to determine the two subjettiness\nmeasures, emphasising the hard substructure for the 1-subjettiness and the full\ncolour radiation pattern for the 2-subjettiness. Relative to existing\n$N$-subjettiness ratios, the dichroic extension, combined with SoftDrop\n(pre-)grooming, makes it possible to increase the ultimate signal significance\nby about $25\\%$ (for $2\\,\\text{TeV}$ jets), or to reduce non-perturbative\neffects by a factor of $2{-}3$ at $50\\%$ signal efficiency while maintaining\ncomparable background rejection. We motivate the dichroic approach through the\nstudy of Lund diagrams, supplemented with resummed analytical calculations.\n", "  We demonstrated sub-wavelength (~111 nm diameter) single nanowire (NW)\ncontinuous wave (CW) lasers on silicon photonic crystal in the telecom-band\nwith direct modulation at 10 Gb/s by optical pumping at cryogenic temperatures.\nTo estimate the small signal response and pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS)\nmodulation of our CW lasers, we employed a new signal detection technique that\nemploys a superconducting single photon detector and a time-correlated single\nphoton counting module. The results showed that our NW laser was unambiguously\nmodulated at above 10 Gb/s and an open eye pattern was obtained. This is the\nfirst demonstration of a telecom-band CW NW laser with high-speed PRBS\nmodulation.\n", "  We propose a holographic image restoration method using an autoencoder, which\nis an artificial neural network. Because holographic reconstructed images are\noften contaminated by direct light, conjugate light, and speckle noise, the\ndiscrimination of reconstructed images may be difficult. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the restoration of reconstructed images from holograms that record\npage data in holographic memory and QR codes by using the proposed method.\n", "  Closed string theory exhibits an O(D,D) duality symmetry on tori, which in\ndouble field theory is manifest before compactification. I prove that to first\norder in $\\alpha'$ there is no manifestly background independent and duality\ninvariant formulation of bosonic string theory in terms of metric, b-field and\ndilaton. To this end I use O(D,D) invariant second order perturbation theory\naround flat space to show that the unique background independent candidate\nexpression for the gauge algebra at order $\\alpha'$ is inconsistent with the\nJacobi identity. A background independent formulation exists instead for frame\nvariables subject to $\\alpha'$-deformed frame transformations (generalized\nGreen-Schwarz transformations). Potential applications for curved backgrounds,\nas in cosmology, are discussed.\n", "  The accurate characterization of electrical double layer properties of\nnanoparticles is of fundamental importance for optimizing their physicochemical\nproperties for specific biotechnological and biomedical applications. In this\narticle, we use classical solvation density functional theory and a surface\ncomplexation model to investigate the effects of pH and nanoparticle size on\nthe structural and electrostatic properties of an electrolyte solution\nsurrounding a spherical silica oxide nanoparticle. The formulation has been\nparticularly useful for identifying dominant interactions governing the ionic\ndriving force under a variety of pH levels and nanoparticle sizes. As a result\nof the energetic interplay displayed between electrostatic potential, ion-ion\ncorrelation and particle crowding effects on the nanoparticle surface\ntitration, rich, non-trivial ion density profiles and mean electrostatic\npotential behavior have been found.\n", "  In classical general relativity described by Einstein-Hilbert gravity, black\nholes behave as thermodynamic objects. In particular, the laws of black hole\nmechanics can be interpreted as laws of thermodynamics. The first law of black\nhole mechanics extends to higher derivative theories via the Noether charge\nconstruction of Wald. One also expects the statement of the second law, which\nin Einstein-Hilbert theory owes to Hawking's area theorem, to extend to higher\nderivative theories. To argue for this however one needs a notion of entropy\nfor dynamical black holes, which the Noether charge construction does not\nprovide. We propose such an entropy function for the family of Lovelock\ntheories, treating the higher derivative terms as perturbations to the\nEinstein-Hilbert theory. Working around a dynamical black hole solution, and\nmaking no assumptions about the amplitude of departure from equilibrium, we\nconstruct a candidate entropy functional valid to all orders in the low energy\neffective field theory. This entropy functional satisfies a second law, modulo\na certain subtle boundary term, which deserves further investigation in\nnon-spherically symmetric situations.\n", "  Photogenerated excitonic ensembles confined in coupled GaAs quantum wells are\nprobed by a complementary approach of emission spectroscopy and resonant\ninelastic light scattering. Lateral electrostatic trap geometries are used to\ncreate dense systems of spatially indirect excitons and excess holes with\nsimilar densities in the order of 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. Inelastic light\nscattering spectra reveal a very sharp low-lying collective mode that is\nidentified at an energy of 0.44 meV and a FWHM of only ~50 $\\mu$eV. This mode\nis interpreted as a plasmon excitation of the excess hole system coupled to the\nphotogenerated indirect excitons. The emission energy of the indirect excitons\nshifts under the application of a perpendicular applied electric field with the\nquantum-confined Stark effect unperturbed from the presence of free charge\ncarriers. Our results illustrate the potential of studying low-lying collective\nexcitations in photogenerated exciton systems to explore the many-body phase\ndiagram, related phase transitions, and interaction physics.\n", "  We propose a new model-independent measurement strategy for the propagation\nspeed of gravitational waves (GWs) based on strongly lensed GWs and their\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts. This can be done in two ways: by comparing\narrival times of GWs and their EM counterparts and by comparing the time delays\nbetween images seen in GWs and their EM counterparts. The lensed GW-EM event is\nperhaps the best way to identify an EM counterpart. Conceptually, this method\ndoes not rely on any specific theory of massive gravitons or modified gravity.\nIts differential setting (i.e., measuring the difference between time delays in\nGW and EM domains) makes it robust against lens modeling details (photons and\nGWs travel in the same lensing potential) and against internal time delays\nbetween GW and EM emission acts. It requires, however, that the theory of\ngravity is metric and predicts gravitational lensing similar to general\nrelativity. We expect that such a test will become possible in the era of\nthird-generation gravitational-wave detectors, when about 10 lensed GW events\nwould be observed each year. The power of this method is mainly limited by the\ntiming accuracy of the EM counterpart, which for kilonovae is around $10^4$\ns.Thisuncertaintycanbesuppressedbya factor of $\\sim 10^{10}$, if strongly\nlensed transients of much shorter duration associated with the GW event can be\nidentified. Candidates for such short transients include short gamma-ray burst\nand fast radio bursts.\n", "  We present a model for quasi-phase matching (QPM) in high-order harmonic\ngeneration (HHG). Using a one-dimensional description, we analyze the\ntime-dependent, ultrafast wave-vector balance to calculate the on-axis harmonic\noutput versus time, from which we obtain the output pulse energy. Considering,\nas an example, periodically patterned argon gas, as may be provided with a grid\nin a cluster jet, we calculate the harmonic output during different time\nintervals within the drive laser pulse duration. We find that identifying a\nsuitable single spatial period is not straightforward due to the complex and\nultrafast plasma dynamics that underlies HHG at increased intensities. The\nmaximum on-axis harmonic pulse energy is obtained when choosing the QPM period\nto phase match HHG at the leading edge of the drive laser pulse.\n", "  We study inelastic two-body relaxation in a spin-polarized ultracold Fermi\ngas in the presence of a p-wave Feshbach resonance. It is shown that in reduced\ndimensionalities, especially in the quasi-one-dimensional case, the enhancement\nof the inelastic rate constant on approach to the resonance is strongly\nsuppressed compared to three dimensions. This may open promising paths for\nobtaining novel many-body states.\n", "  In the present work we study the consequences of considering an inflationary\nuniverse model in which the Hubble rate has a quasi-exponential dependence in\nthe inflaton field, given by $H(\\phi)=H_{inf}\\exp\n\\left[\\frac{\\frac{\\phi}{m_p}}{p\\left(1+\\frac{\\phi}{m_p}\\right)}\\right]$. We\nanalyze the inflation dynamics under the Hamilton-Jacobi approach, which allows\nus to consider $H(\\phi)$, rather than $V(\\phi)$, as the fundamental quantity to\nbe specified. By comparing the theoretical predictions of the model together\nwith the allowed contour plots in the $n_s-r$ plane and the amplitude of\nprimordial scalar perturbations from the latest Planck data, the parameters\ncharactering this model are constrained. The model predicts values for the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and for the running of the scalar spectral index\n$dn_s/ d\\ln k$ consistent with the current bounds imposed by Planck, and we\nconclude that the model is viable.\n", "  We investigate the potential to probe new neutrino physics with future\nexperiments measuring coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering. Experiments with\nhigh statistics should become feasible soon and allow to constrain parameters\nwith unprecedented precision. Using a benchmark setup for a future experiment\nprobing reactor neutrinos, we study the sensitivity on neutrino non-standard\ninteractions and new exotic neutral currents (scalar, tensor, etc). Compared to\nFermi interaction, percent and permille level strengths of the new interactions\ncan be probed, superseding for some observables the limits from future neutrino\noscillation experiments by up to two orders of magnitude.\n", "  We compute from chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions the energy per\nparticle of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter at third-order in\nperturbation theory including self-consistent second-order single-particle\nenergies. Particular attention is paid to the third-order particle-hole\nring-diagram, which is often neglected in microscopic calculations of the\nequation of state. We provide semi-analytic expressions for the direct terms\nfrom central and tensor model-type interactions that are useful as theoretical\nbenchmarks. We investigate uncertainties arising from the order-by-order\nconvergence in both many-body perturbation theory and the chiral expansion.\nIncluding also variations in the resolution scale at which nuclear forces are\nresolved, we provide new error bands on the equation of state, the\nisospin-asymmetry energy, and its slope parameter. We find in particular that\nthe inclusion of third-order diagrams reduces the theoretical uncertainty at\nlow densities, while in general the largest error arises from omitted\nhigher-order terms in the chiral expansion of the nuclear forces.\n", "  We present precise measurements of the assembly bias of dark matter halos,\ni.e. the dependence of halo bias on other properties than the mass, using\ncurved \"separate universe\" N-body simulations which effectively incorporate an\ninfinite-wavelength matter overdensity into the background density. This method\nmeasures the LIMD (local-in-matter-density) bias parameters $b_n$ in the\nlarge-scale limit. We focus on the dependence of the first two Eulerian biases\n$b^E_1$ and $b^E_2$ on four halo properties: the concentration, spin, mass\naccretion rate, and ellipticity. We quantitatively compare our results with\nprevious works in which assembly bias was measured on fairly small scales.\nDespite this difference, our findings are in good agreement with previous\nresults. We also look at the joint dependence of bias on two halo properties in\naddition to the mass. Finally, using the excursion set peaks model, we attempt\nto shed new insights on how assembly bias arises in this analytical model.\n", "  Peculiar properties of the BFKL approach in the next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic approximation (NNLLA) are discussed. In this approximation the\nscheme of derivation of the BFKL equation must be changed because of violation\nof the simple factorized form of amplitudes with multi-Reggeon exchanges and\nnecessity to take into account imaginary parts of amplitudes in the unitarity\nrelations.\n", "  An iterative scheme can be used to find a steady-state solution to the\nBoltzmann equation, however, it is very slow to converge in the near-continuum\nflow regime. In this paper, a synthetic iterative scheme is developed to speed\nup the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation. The velocity distribution\nfunction is first solved by the conventional iterative scheme, then it is\ncorrected such that the macroscopic flow velocity is governed by a diffusion\nequation which is asymptotic-preserving in the Navier-Stokes limit. The\nefficiency of the new scheme is verified by calculating the eigenvalue of the\niteration, as well as solving for Poiseuille and thermal transpiration flows.\nThe synthetic iterative scheme is significantly faster than the conventional\niterative scheme in both the transition and the near-continuum flow regimes.\nMoreover, due to the asymptotic-preserving properties, the SIS needs less\nspatial resolution in the near-continuum flow regimes, which makes it even\nfaster than the conventional iterative scheme. Using this synthetic iterative\nscheme, and the fast spectral approximation of the linearized Boltzmann\ncollision operator, Poiseuille and thermal transpiration flows between two\nparallel plates, through channels of circular/rectangular cross sections, and\nvarious porous media are calculated over the whole range of gas rarefaction.\nFinally, the flow of a Ne-Ar gas mixture is solved based on the linearized\nBoltzmann equation with the Lennard-Jones potential for the first time, and the\ndifference between these results and those using hard-sphere intermolecular\npotential is discussed.\n", "  We study a random matrix model for QCD at finite density via complex Langevin\ndynamics. This model has a phase transition to a phase with nonzero baryon\ndensity. We study the convergence of the algorithm as a function of the quark\nmass and the chemical potential and focus on two main observables: the baryon\ndensity and the chiral condensate. For simulations close to the chiral limit,\nthe algorithm has wrong convergence properties when the quark mass is in the\nspectral domain of the Dirac operator. A possible solution of this problem is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We briefly discuss the current status of lattice QCD simulations and review\nselective results on nucleon observables focusing on recent developments in the\nlattice QCD evaluation of the nucleon form factors and radii, parton\ndistribution functions and their moments, and the neutron electric dipole\nmoment. Nucleon charges and moments of parton distribution functions are\npresented using simulations generated at physical values of the quark masses,\nwhile exploratory studies are performed for the parton distribution functions\nand the neutron electric dipole moment at heavier than physical value of the\npion mass.\n", "  The electronic structure of the cleaved perovskite (CH3NH3PbBr3) single\ncrystal was studied in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy\n(IPES). Highly reproducible dispersive features of the valence bands were\nobserved with nice symmetry about the Brillouin zone center and boundaries. The\nlargest dispersion width was found to be ~0.73 eV and ~0.98 eV along the\n{\\Gamma}X and {\\Gamma}M directions, respectively. The effective mass of the\nholes was estimated to be ~0.59 m0. The quality of the surface was verified by\natomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The\nelemental composition was investigated by high resolution x-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS). The experimental electronic structure shows a good\nagreement with the theoretical calculation.\n", "  We present a new model for soft interactions in the event-generator Herwig.\nThe model consists of two components. One to model diffractive final states on\nthe basis of the cluster hadronization model and a second component that\naddresses soft multiple interactions as multiple particle production in multi-\nperipheral kinematics. We present much improved results for minimum-bias\nmeasurements at various LHC energies.\n", "  We demonstrate an online (in-situ) sensor for continuous detection of oil\ncontamination in compressed air systems complying with the ISO-8573 standard.\nThe sensor is based on the photo-acoustic (PA) effect. The online and real-time\nPA sensor system has the potential to benefit a wide range of users that\nrequire high purity compressed air. Among these are hospitals, pharmaceutical\nindustries, electronics manufacturers, and clean room facilities. The sensor\nwas tested for sensitivity, repeatability, robustness to molecular\ncross-interference, and stability of calibration. Explicit measurements of\nhexane (C${_6}$H$_{14}$) and decane (C${_{10}}$H$_{22}$) vapors via excitation\nof molecular C-H vibrations at approx. 2950 cm$^{-1}$ (3.38 $\\mu$m) were\nconducted with a custom made interband cascade laser (ICL). For the decane\nmeasurements a (1 $\\sigma$) standard deviation (STD) of 0.3 ppb was\ndemonstrated, which corresponds to a normalized noise equivalent absorption\n(NNEA) coefficient for the prototype PA sensor of 2.8$\\times 10^{-9}$ W\ncm$^{-1}$ Hz$^{1/2}$.\n", "  We present a new scenario for generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe\nthat is induced by a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson. The shift symmetry naturally\ncontrols the operators in the theory, while allowing the NG boson to couple to\nthe spacetime geometry as well as to the baryons. The cosmological background\nthus sources a coherent motion of the NG boson, which leads to baryogenesis.\nGood candidates of the baryon-generating NG boson are the QCD axion and\naxion-like fields. In these cases the axion induces baryogenesis in the early\nuniverse, and can also serve as dark matter in the late universe.\n", "  A new approach, combining the Ibragimov method and the one by Anco and\nBluman, with the aim of algorithmically computing local conservation laws of\npartial differential equations, is discussed. Some examples of the application\nof the procedure are given. The method, of course, is able to recover all the\nconservation laws found by using the direct method; at the same time we can\ncharacterize which symmetry, if any, is responsible for the existence of a\ngiven conservation law. Some new local conservation laws for the Short Pulse\nequation and for the Fornberg Whitham equation are also determined.\n", "  The four-loop determination of the strong coupling from fully inclusive\nobservables is reviewed. Special attention is given to the low-energy\nmeasurement extracted from the hadronic $\\tau$ decay width. A recent exhaustive\nanalysis of the ALEPH data, exploring several complementary methodologies with\nvery different sensitivities to inverse power corrections and duality\nviolations, confirms the strong suppression of non-perturbative contributions\nto $R_\\tau$. It gives the value $\\alpha_s(m_\\tau^2)= 0.328 \\pm 0.013$, which\nimplies $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)= 0.1197 \\pm 0.0015$. The excellent agreement with the\ndirect measurement at the $Z$ peak, $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)= 0.1196 \\pm 0.0030$,\nprovides a beautiful test of asymptotic freedom. Together with the most recent\nlattice average from FLAG and the NNLO determinations from $e^+e^-$, PDFs and\ncollider data quoted by the PDG, these two inclusive determinations imply a\nworld average value $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)= 0.1180 \\pm 0.0010$.\n", "  We construct a new class of integrable $\\sigma$-models based on current\nalgebra theories for a general semisimple group $G$ by utilizing a left-right\nasymmetric gauging. Their action can be thought of as the all-loop effective\naction of two independent WZW models for $G$ both at level $k$, perturbed by\ncurrent bilinears mixing the different WZW models. A non-perturbative symmetry\nin the couplings parametric space is revealed. We perform the Hamiltonian\nanalysis of the action and demonstrate integrability in several cases. We\nextend our construction to deformations of $G/H$ CFTs and show integrability\nwhen $G/H$ is a symmetric space. Our method resembles that used for\nconstructing the $\\lambda$-deformed integrable $\\sigma$-models, but the results\nare distinct and novel.\n", "  Dyonic gaugings of four-dimensional supergravity typically exhibit a richer\nvacuum structure compared to their purely electric counterparts, but their\nhigher-dimensional origin often remains more mysterious. We consider a class of\ndyonic gaugings with gauge groups of the type (SO(p,q)xSO(p',q'))$\\ltimes N$\nwith $N$ nilpotent. Using generalized Scherk-Schwarz reductions of exceptional\nfield theory, we show how these four-dimensional gaugings may be consistently\nembedded in Type II supergravity upon compactification around products of\nspheres and hyperboloids. As an application, we give the explicit uplift of the\nN=4 AdS$_4$ vacuum of the theory with gauge group (SO(6)xSO(1,1))$\\ltimes\nT^{12}$ into a supersymmetric AdS$_4$x$M_5$x$S^1$ S-fold solution of IIB\nsupergravity. The internal space $M_5$ is a squashed $S^5$ preserving an SO(4)$\n\\subset $ SO(6) subset of its isometries.\n", "  The class of topological semimetals comprises a large pool of compounds.\nTogether they provide a wide platform to realize exotic quasiparticles for\nexample Dirac, nodal line Dirac and Weyl fermions. In this letter, we report\nthe Berry phase, Fermi surface topology and anisotropic magnetoresistance of\nHfSiS which has recently been predicted to be a nodal line semimetal. This\ncompound contains large carrier density, higher than most of the known\nsemimetals. Massive amplitudes of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations up to 20 K in 7 T assist us in witnessing nontrivial pi-Berry\nphase which is a consequence of topological Dirac-type dispersion of bands\noriginating from the hybridization of px + py and dx2-y2 orbitals of square-net\nplane of Si and Hf atoms, respectively. Furthermore, we establish the 3D\nFermi-surface which consists of very asymmetric water caltrop-like electron and\nbarley seed-like hole pockets which account for the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance in HfSiS.\n", "  We use the one-dimensional object-oriented particle-in-cell Monte Carlo\ncollision code {\\tt oopd1} to explore the spatio-temporal evolution of the\nelectron heating mechanism in a capacitively coupled oxygen discharge in the\npressure range 10 -- 200 mTorr. The electron heating is most significant in the\nsheath vicinity during the sheath expansion phase. We explore how including and\nexcluding detachment by the singlet metastable states O$_2$(a$^1 \\Delta_{\\rm\ng}$) and O$_2$(b$^1\\Sigma_{\\rm g}^+$) influences the heating mechanism, the\neffective electron temperature and electronegativity, in the oxygen discharge.\nWe demonstrate that the detachment processes have a significant influence on\nthe discharge properties, in particular for the higher pressures. At 10 mTorr\nthe time averaged electron heating shows mainly ohmic heating in the plasma\nbulk (the electronegative core) and at higher pressures there is no ohmic\nheating in the plasma bulk, that is electron heating in the sheath regions\ndominates.\n", "  The Star Formation in Nearby Clouds (SFiNCs) project is aimed at providing\ndetailed study of the young stellar populations and star cluster formation in\nnearby 22 star forming regions (SFRs) for comparison with our earlier MYStIX\nsurvey of richer, more distant clusters. As a foundation for the SFiNCs science\nstudies, here, homogeneous data analyses of the Chandra X-ray and Spitzer\nmid-infrared archival SFiNCs data are described, and the resulting catalogs of\nover 15300 X-ray and over 1630000 mid-infrared point sources are presented. On\nthe basis of their X-ray/infrared properties and spatial distributions, nearly\n8500 point sources have been identified as probable young stellar members of\nthe SFiNCs regions. Compared to the existing X-ray/mid-infrared publications,\nthe SFiNCs member list increases the census of YSO members by 6-200% for\nindividual SFRs and by 40% for the merged sample of all 22 SFiNCs SFRs.\n", "  We present a calculation of the $\\eta$-$\\eta'$ mixing in the framework of\nlarge-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory. A general expression for the\n$\\eta$-$\\eta'$ mixing at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) is derived,\nincluding higher-derivative terms up to fourth order in the four momentum,\nkinetic and mass terms. In addition, the axial-vector decay constants of the\n$\\eta$-$\\eta'$ system are determined at NNLO. The numerical analysis of the\nresults is performed successively at LO, NLO, and NNLO. We investigate the\ninfluence of one-loop corrections, OZI-rule-violating parameters, and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N_c p^6)$ contact terms.\n", "  A simple model of the dynamics of lightly bound skyrmions is developed in\nwhich skyrmions are replaced by point particles, each carrying an internal\norientation. The model accounts well for the static energy minimizers of baryon\nnumber $1\\leq B\\leq 8$ obtained by numerical simulation of the full field\ntheory. For $9\\leq B\\leq 23$, a large number of static solutions of the point\nparticle model are found, all closely resembling size $B$ subsets of a face\ncentred cubic lattice, with the particle orientations dictated by a simple\ncolouring rule. Rigid body quantization of these solutions is performed, and\nthe spin and isospin of the corresponding ground states extracted. As part of\nthe quantization scheme, an algorithm to compute the symmetry group of an\noriented point cloud, and to determine its corresponding Finkelstein-Rubinstein\nconstraints, is devised.\n", "  We discuss the evolution of an energetic jet which propagates through a dense\nquark-gluon plasma and radiates gluons due to its interactions with the medium.\nWithin perturbative QCD, this evolution can be described as a stochastic\nbranching process, that we have managed to solve exactly. We present exact,\nanalytic, results for the gluon spectrum (the average gluon distribution) and\nfor the higher n-point functions, which describe correlations and fluctuations.\nUsing these results, we construct the event-by-event picture of the gluon\ndistribution produced via medium-induced gluon branching. In contrast to what\nhappens in a usual QCD cascade in vacuum, the medium-induced branchings are\nquasi-democratic, with offspring gluons carrying sizable fractions of the\nenergy of their parent parton. We find large fluctuations in the energy loss\nand in the multiplicity of soft gluons. The multiplicity distribution is\npredicted to exhibit KNO (Koba-Nielsen-Olesen) scaling. These predictions can\nbe tested in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, via event-by-event measurements of\nthe di-jet asymmetry.\n  Based on JHEP 1605 (2016) 008 and arXiv:1609.06104\n", "  We compute electrical and thermal conductivities of hydrogen plasmas in the\nnon-degenerate regime using Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) and an\napplication of the Kubo-Greenwood response formula, and demonstrate that for\nthermal conductivity, the mean-field treatment of the electron-electron (e-e)\ninteraction therein is insufficient to reproduce the weak-coupling limit\nobtained by plasma kinetic theories. An explicit e-e scattering correction to\nthe DFT is posited by appealing to Matthiessen's Rule and the results of our\ncomputations of conductivities with the quantum Lenard-Balescu (QLB) equation.\nFurther motivation of our correction is provided by an argument arising from\nthe Zubarev quantum kinetic theory approach. Significant emphasis is placed on\nour efforts to produce properly converged results for plasma transport using\nKohn-Sham DFT, so that an accurate assessment of the importance and efficacy of\nour e-e scattering corrections to the thermal conductivity can be made.\n", "  Materials with charged chiral quasiparticles in external parallel electric\nand magnetic fields can support an electric current that grows linearly in\ntime, corresponding to diverging DC conductivity. From experimental viewpoint,\nthis \"Chiral Magnetic Superconductivity\" (CMS) is thus analogous to\nconventional superconductivity. However the underlying physics is entirely\ndifferent -- the CMS does not require a condensate of Cooper pairs breaking the\ngauge degeneracy, and is thus not accompanied by Meissner effect. Instead, it\nowes its existence to the (temperature-independent) quantum chiral anomaly and\nthe conservation of chirality. As a result, this phenomenon can be expected to\nsurvive to much higher temperatures. Even though the chirality of\nquasiparticles is not strictly conserved in real materials, the chiral magnetic\nsuperconductivity should still exhibit itself in AC measurements at frequencies\nlarger than the chirality-flipping rate, and in microstructures of Dirac and\nWeyl semimetals with thickness below the mean chirality-flipping length that is\nabout 1-100 $\\mu$m. In nuclear physics, the CMS should contribute to the\ncharge-dependent elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  In this paper we lay out a simple set of relationships connecting the\ndynamics of fast plasma jets to the dynamical state of their ambient media. The\nobjective is to provide a tool kit that can be used to connect the morphologies\nof radio AGNs in galaxy clusters to the dynamical state of the local ICM. The\nformalism is intended to apply to jets whether they are relativistic or\nnon-relativistic. Special attention is paid to interactions involving ICM\nshocks, although the results can be applied more broadly. Our formalism\nemphasizes the importance of the relative Mach number of the impacting ICM flow\nand the internal Mach number of the AGN jet in determining how the AGN outflows\nevolve.\n", "  Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH) provide an ideal playground for\nexploring light-matter interactions at the atomic scale. In particular,\nstructures with a type-II band alignment can yield detailed insight into free\ncarrier-to-photon conversion processes, which are central to e.g. solar cells\nand light emitting diodes. An important first step in describing such processes\nis to obtain the energies of the interlayer exciton states existing at the\ninterface. Here we present a general first-principles method to compute the\nelectronic quasi-particle (QP) band structure and excitonic binding energies of\nincommensurate vdWHs. The method combines our quantum electrostatic\nheterostructure (QEH) model for obtaining the dielectric function with the\nmany-body GW approximation and a generalized 2D Mott-Wannier exciton model. We\ncalculate the level alignment together with intra and interlayer exciton\nbinding energies of bilayer MoS$_2$/WSe$_2$ with and without intercalated hBN\nlayers, finding excellent agreement with experimental photoluminescence\nspectra. Comparison to density functional theory calculations demonstrate the\ncrucial role of self-energy and electron-hole interaction effects.\n", "  The Efimov effect in heteronuclear cold atomic systems is experimentally more\neasily accessible than the Efimov effect for identical atoms, because of the\npotentially smaller scaling factor. We focus on the case of two or three heavy\nidentical bosons and another atom. The former case was recently observed in a\nmixture of 133Cs and 6Li atoms. We employ the Gaussian Expansion Method as\ndeveloped by Hiyama, Kino et al.. This is a variational method that uses\nGaussians that are distributed geometrically over a chosen range. Supplemental\ncalculations are performed using the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Blume\net al. previously investigated the scaling properties of heteronuclear systems\nin the unitary limit and at the three-body breakup threshold. We have completed\nthis picture by calculating the behaviour on the positive scattering length\nside of the Efimov plot, focussing on the dimer threshold.\n", "  We introduce a global analysis of collinearly factorized nuclear parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) including, for the first time, data constraints\nfrom LHC proton-lead collisions. In comparison to our previous analysis, EPS09,\nwhere data only from charged-lepton-nucleus deep inelastic scattering (DIS),\nDrell-Yan (DY) dilepton production in proton-nucleus collisions and inclusive\npion production in deuteron-nucleus collisions were the input, we now increase\nthe variety of data constraints to cover also neutrino-nucleus DIS and low-mass\nDY production in pion-nucleus collisions. The new LHC data significantly extend\nthe kinematic reach of the data constraints. We now allow much more freedom for\nthe flavour dependence of nuclear effects than in other currently available\nanalyses. As a result, especially the uncertainty estimates are more objective\nflavour by flavour. The neutrino DIS plays a pivotal role in obtaining a\nmutually consistent behaviour for both up and down valence quarks, and the LHC\ndijet data clearly constrain gluons at large momentum fraction. Mainly for\ninsufficient statistics, the pion-nucleus DY and heavy gauge boson production\nin proton-lead collisions impose less visible constraints. The outcome - a new\nset of next-to-leading order nuclear PDFs called EPPS16 - is made available for\napplications in high-energy nuclear collisions.\n", "  Theoretical analysis, which maps single molecule time trajectories of a\nmolecular motor onto unicyclic Markov processes, allows us to evaluate the heat\ndissipated from the motor and to elucidate its dependence on the mean velocity\nand diffusivity. Unlike passive Brownian particles in equilibrium, the velocity\nand diffusion constant of molecular motors are closely inter-related to each\nother. In particular, our study makes it clear that the increase of diffusivity\nwith the heat production is a natural outcome of active particles, which is\nreminiscent of the recent experimental premise that the diffusion of an\nexothermic enzyme is enhanced by the heat released from its own catalytic\nturnover. Compared with freely diffusing exothermic enzymes, kinesin-1 whose\ndynamics is confined on one-dimensional tracks is highly efficient in\ntransforming conformational fluctuations into a locally directed motion, thus\ndisplaying a significantly higher enhancement in diffusivity with its turnover\nrate. Putting molecular motors and freely diffusing enzymes on an equal\nfooting, our study offers thermodynamic basis to understand the heat enhanced\nself-diffusion of exothermic enzymes.\n", "  We investigate effects of quasiparticle poisoning in a Majorana island with\nstrong tunnel coupling to normal-metal leads. In addition to the main Coulomb\nblockade diamonds, \"shadow\" diamonds appear, shifted by 1e in gate voltage,\nconsistent with transport through an excited (poisoned) state of the island.\nComparison to a simple model yields an estimate of parity lifetime for the\nstrongly coupled island (~ 1 {\\mu}s) and sets a bound for a weakly coupled\nisland (> 10 {\\mu}s). Fluctuations in the gate-voltage spacing of Coulomb peaks\nat high field, reflecting Majorana hybridization, are enhanced by the reduced\nlever arm at strong coupling. In energy units, fluctuations are consistent with\nprevious measurements.\n", "  The lifetime of the recently discovered $2p$ emitter $^{67}$Kr was recently\nfound considerably below the lower limit predicted theoretically. This\ncommunication addresses this issue.Different separation energy systematics are\nanalyzed and different mechanisms for $2p$ emission are evaluated. It is found\nthat the most plausible reason for this disagreement is a decay mechanism of\n$^{67}$Kr, which is not \"true $2p$\" emission, but \"transition dynamics\" on the\nborderline between true $2p$ and sequential $2p$ decay mechanisms. If this is\ntrue, this imposes stringent limits $E_r=1.35-1.42$ MeV on the ground state\nenergy of $^{66}$Br relative to the $^{65}$Se-$p$ threshold.\n", "  We propose a gauge-invariant description for the Higgs mechanism by which a\ngauge boson acquires the mass. We do not need to assume spontaneous breakdown\nof gauge symmetry signaled by a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the\nscalar field. In fact, we give a manifestly gauge-invariant description of the\nHiggs mechanism in the operator level, which does not rely on spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. For concreteness, we discuss the gauge-Higgs models with\n$U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ gauge groups explicitly. This enables us to discuss the\nconfinement-Higgs complementarity from a new perspective.\n", "  We present the status of our formalism for extracting three-particle\nscattering observables from lattice QCD (LQCD). The method relies on relating\nthe discrete finite-volume spectrum of a quantum field theory with its\nscattering amplitudes. As the finite-volume spectrum can be directly determined\nin LQCD, this provides a method for determining scattering observables, and\nassociated resonance properties, from the underlying theory. In a pair of\npapers published over the last two years, two of us have extended this approach\nto apply to relativistic three-particle scattering states. In this talk we\nsummarize recent progress in checking and further extending this result. We\ndescribe an extension of the formalism to include systems in which two-to-three\ntransitions can occur. We then present a check of the previously published\nformalism, in which we reproduce the known finite-volume energy shift of a\nthree-particle bound state.\n", "  The particular structure of Galileon interactions allows for\nhigher-derivative terms while retaining second order field equations for scalar\nfields and Abelian $p$-forms. In this work we introduce an index-free\nformulation of these interactions in terms of two sets of Grassmannian\nvariables. We employ this to construct Galileon interactions for mixed-symmetry\ntensor fields and coupled systems thereof. We argue that these tensors are the\nnatural generalization of scalars with Galileon symmetry, similar to $p$-forms\nand scalars with a shift-symmetry. The simplest case corresponds to linearised\ngravity with Lovelock invariants, relating the Galileon symmetry to\ndiffeomorphisms. Finally, we examine the coupling of a mixed-symmetry tensor to\ngravity, and demonstrate in an explicit example that the inclusion of\nappropriate counterterms retains second order field equations.\n", "  We show how successful supersymmetric hybrid inflation is realized in\nrealistic models where the resolution of the minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel mu problem is intimately linked with axion physics. The scalar fields\nthat accompany the axion, such as the saxion, are closely monitored during and\nafter inflation to ensure that the axion isocurvature perturbations lie below\nthe observational limits. The scalar spectral index n_s is about 0.96 - 0.97,\nwhile the tensor-to-scalar ratio r, a canonical measure of gravity waves, lies\nwell below the observable range in our example. The axion domain walls are\ninflated away, and depending on the axion decay constant f_a and the magnitude\nof the mu parameter, the axions and/or the lightest supersymmetric particle\ncompose the dark matter in the universe. Non-thermal leptogenesis is naturally\nimplemented in this class of models.\n", "  We review lattice calculations of the elementary Greens functions of QCD with\na special emphasis on the Landau gauge. These lattice results have been of\ninterest to continuum approaches to QCD over the past 20 years. They are used\nas reference for Dyson-Schwinger- and functional renormalization group equation\ncalculations as well as for hadronic bound-state equations. The lattice\nprovides low-energy data for propagators and three-point vertices in Landau\ngauge at zero and finite temperature even including dynamical fermions. We\nsummarize Michael M\\\"uller-Preu{\\ss}ker's important contributions to this field\nand put them into the perspective of his other research interests.\n", "  We use ferromagnetic resonance to study the current-induced torques in\nYIG/heavy metal bilayers. YIG samples with thickness varying from 14.8 nm to 80\nnm, with Pt or Ta thin film on top, are measured by applying a microwave\ncurrent into the heavy metals and measuring the longitudinal DC voltage\ngenerated by both spin rectification and spin pumping. From a symmetry analysis\nof the FMR lineshape and its dependence on YIG thickness, we deduce that the\nOersted field dominates over spin-transfer torque in driving magnetization\ndynamics.\n", "  The prevalent use of large volume liquid argon detectors strongly motivates\nthe development of novel readout and monitoring technology which functions at\ncryogenic temperatures. This paper presents the development of a cryogenic CMOS\ncamera system suitable for use inside a large volume liquid argon detector for\nonline monitoring purposes. The characterisation of the system is described in\ndetail. The reliability of such a camera system has been demonstrated over\nseveral months, and recent data from operation within the liquid argon region\nof the DUNE 35tcryostat is presented. The cameras were used to monitor for high\nvoltage breakdown inside the cryostat, with capability to observe breakdown of\na liquid argon time projection chamber in situ. They were also used for\ndetector monitoring, especially of components during cooldown.\n", "  Even when neglecting diffraction effects, the well-known equations of\ngeometrical optics (GO) are not entirely accurate. Traditional GO treats wave\nrays as classical particles, which are completely described by their\ncoordinates and momenta, but vector-wave rays have another degree of freedom,\nnamely, their polarization. The polarization degree of freedom manifests itself\nas an effective (classical) \"wave spin\" that can be assigned to rays and can\naffect the wave dynamics accordingly. A well-known manifestation of\npolarization dynamics is mode conversion, which is the linear exchange of\nquanta between different wave modes and can be interpreted as a rotation of the\nwave spin. Another, less-known polarization effect is the polarization-driven\nbending of ray trajectories. This work presents an extension and reformulation\nof GO as a first-principle Lagrangian theory, whose effective-gauge Hamiltonian\ngoverns the aforementioned polarization phenomena simultaneously. As an\nexample, the theory is applied to describe the polarization-driven divergence\nof right-hand and left-hand circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in\nweakly magnetized plasma.\n", "  We develop efficient ways to consider and correct for the effects of hidden\nunits for the paradigmatic case of the inverse kinetic Ising model with fully\nasymmetric couplings. We identify two sources of error in reconstructing the\nconnectivity among the observed units while ignoring part of the network. One\nleads to a systematic bias in the inferred parameters, whereas the other\ninvolves correlations between the visible and hidden populations and has a\nmagnitude that depends on the coupling strength. We estimate these two terms\nusing a mean field approach and derive self-consistent equations for the\ncouplings accounting for the systematic bias. Through application of these\nmethods on simple networks of varying relative population size and connectivity\nstrength, we assess how and under what conditions the hidden portion can\ninfluence inference and to what degree it can be crudely estimated. We find\nthat for weak to moderately coupled systems, the effects of the hidden units is\na simple rotation that can be easily corrected for. For strongly coupled\nsystems, the non-systematic term becomes large and can no longer be safely\nignored, further highlighting the importance of understanding the average\nstrength of couplings for a given system of interest.\n", "  Active colloids and externally actuated semi-flexible filaments provide basic\nbuilding blocks for designing autonomously motile micro-machines. Here, we show\nthat a passive semi-flexible filament can be actuated and transported by\nattaching an active colloid to its terminus. We study the dynamics of this\nassembly when it is free, tethered, or clamped using overdamped equations of\nmotion that explicitly account for active fluid flow and the forces it\nmediates. Linear states are destabilized by buckling instabilities to produce\nstable states of non-zero curvature and writhe. We demarcate boundaries of\nthese states in the two-dimensional parameter space representing dimensionless\nmeasures of polar and apolar activity. Our proposed assembly can be used as a\nnovel component in the design of micro-machines at low Reynolds number and to\nstudy elastic instabilities driven by \"follower\" forces.\n", "  Modification of gravity due to the curvature dependent term in the\ngravitational baryogenesis scenario is considered. It is shown that this term\nleads to the fourth order differential equation of motion for the curvature\nscalar instead of the algebraic one of General Relativity (GR). The fourth\norder gravitational equations are generically unstable with respect to small\nperturbations. Non-linear in curvature terms may stabilize the solution but the\nmagnitude of the stabilized curvature scalar would be much larger than that\ndictated by GR, so the standard cosmology would be strongly distorted.\n", "  The properties of the QCD axion are strictly related to the dependence of\nstrong interactions on the topological parameter theta. We present a\ndetermination of the topological properties of QCD for temperatures up to\naround 600 MeV, obtained by lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 flavors and\nphysical quark masses. Numerical results for the topological susceptibility,\nwhen compared to instanton gas computations, differ both in size and in the\ntemperature dependence. We discuss the implications of such findings for axion\nphenomenology, also in comparison to similar studies in the literature, and the\nprospects for future investigations.\n", "  The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is a storage ring for advanced\nbeam physics research currently being built and commissioned at Fermilab. It\nwill operate with protons and electrons using injectors with momenta of 70 and\n150 MeV/c, respectively. The research program includes the study of nonlinear\nfocusing integrable optical beam lattices based on special magnets and electron\nlenses, beam dynamics of space-charge effects and their compensation, optical\nstochastic cooling, and several other experiments. In this article, we present\nthe design and main parameters of the facility, outline progress to date and\nprovide the timeline of the construction, commissioning and research. The\nphysical principles, design, and hardware implementation plans for the major\nIOTA experiments are also discussed.\n", "  We present semi-analytic radiative-shock solutions in which grey Sn-transport\nis used to model the radiation, and we include both constant cross sections and\ncross sections that depend on temperature and density. These new solutions\nsolve for a variable Eddington factor (VEF) across the shock domain, which\nallows for interesting physics not seen before in radiative-shock solutions.\nComparisons are made with the grey nonequilibrium-diffusion radiative-shock\nsolutions of Lowrie and Edwards [1], which assumed that the Eddington factor is\nconstant across the shock domain. It is our experience that the local Mach\nnumber is monotonic when producing nonequilibrium-diffusion solutions, but that\nthis monotonicity may disappear while integrating the precursor region to\nproduce Sn-transport solutions. For temperature- and density-dependent cross\nsections we show evidence of a spike in the VEF in the far upstream portion of\nthe radiative-shock precursor. We show evidence of an adaptation zone in the\nprecursor region, adjacent to the embedded hydrodynamic shock, as conjectured\nby Drake [2, 3], and also confirm his expectation that the precursor\ntemperatures adjacent to the Zeldovich spike take values that are greater than\nthe downstream post-shock equilibrium temperature. We also show evidence that\nthe radiation energy density can be nonmonotonic under the Zeldovich spike,\nwhich is indicative of anti-diffusive radiation flow as predicted by McClarren\nand Drake [4]. We compare the angle dependence of the radiation flow for the\nSn-transport and nonequilibrium-diffusion radiation solutions, and show that\nthere are considerable differences in the radiation flow between these models\nacross the shock structure. Finally, we analyze the radiation flow to\nunderstand the cause of the adaptation zone, as well as the structure of the\nSn-transport radiation-intensity solutions across the shock structure.\n", "  We compute the spectral index of primordial perturbations in a rainbow\nuniverse. We allow the Newton constant $G$ to run at (super-)Planckian energies\nand we consider both vacuum and thermal perturbations. If the rainbow metric is\nthe one associated to a generalized Horava-Lifshitz dispersion relation, we\nfind that only when $G$ tends asymptotically to zero can one match the observed\nvalue of the spectral index and solve the horizon problem, both for vacuum and\nthermal perturbations. For vacuum fluctuations the observational constraints\nimply that the primordial universe expansion can be both accelerating or\ndecelerating, while in the case of thermal perturbations only decelerating\nexpansion is allowed.\n", "  We calculate the trace and axial anomalies of $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$\nsuperconformal theories with exactly marginal deformations, on a surface with\nboundary. Extending recent work by Gomis et al, we derive the boundary\ncontribution that captures the anomalous scale dependence of the one-point\nfunctions of exactly marginal operators. Integration of the bulk super-Weyl\nanomaly shows that the sphere partition function computes the K\\\"ahler\npotential $K(\\lambda, \\bar\\lambda)$ on the superconformal manifold. Likewise,\nour results confirm the conjecture that the partition function on the\nsupersymmetric hemisphere computes the holomorphic central charge,\n$c^\\Omega(\\lambda)$, associated with the boundary condition $\\Omega$. The\nboundary entropy, given by a ratio of hemispheres and sphere, is therefore\nfully determined by anomalies.\n", "  Refractive index of tubulin is an important parameter underlying fundamental\nelectromagnetic and biophysical properties of microtubules - protein fibers\nessential for several cell functions including cell division. Yet, the only\nexperimental data available in the current literature show values of tubulin\nrefractive index (n\\,=\\,2.36\\,-\\,2.90) which are much higher than established\ntheories predict based on the weighted contribution of the polarizability of\nindividual amino acids constituting the protein. To resolve this controversy,\nwe report here modeling and rigorous experimental analysis of refractive index\nof purified tubulin dimer. Our experimental data revealed that the refractive\nindex of tubulin is n\\,=\\,1.64 at the wavelength 589\\,nm and 25\\,$^{\\circ}{\\rm\nC}$, that is much closer to the values predicted by established theories than\nthe earlier experimental data provide.\n", "  Based on an extensive redshift survey for galaxy cluster Abell 2029 and Coma,\nwe measure the luminosity functions (LFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs) for\nthe entire cluster member galaxies. Most importantly, we measure the velocity\ndispersion functions (VDFs) for quiescent members. The MMT/Hectospec redshift\nsurvey for galaxies in A2029 identifies 982 spectroscopic members; for 838\nmembers we derive the central velocity dispersion from the spectroscopy. Coma\nis the only other cluster surveyed as densely. The LFs, SMFs and VDFs for A2029\nand Coma are essentially identical. The SMFs of the clusters are consistent\nwith simulations. The A2029 and Coma VDFs for quiescent galaxies have a\nsignificantly steeper slope than those of field galaxies for velocity\ndispersion $\\lesssim 100$ km s$^{-1}$. The cluster VDFs also exceed the field\nat velocity dispersion $\\gtrsim 250$ km s$^{-1}$. The differences between\ncluster and field VDFs are potentially important tests of simulations and of\nthe formation of structure in the universe.\n", "  We study the phase transition in a helimagnetic film with Heisenberg spins\nunder an applied magnetic field in the c direction perpendicular to the film.\nThe helical structure is due to the an-tiferromagnetic interaction between\nnext-nearest neighbors in the c direction. Helimagnetic films in zero field are\nknown to have a strong modification of the in-plane helical angle near the film\nsurfaces. We show that spins react to a moderate applied magnetic field by\ncreating a particular spin configuration along the c axis. With increasing\ntemperature (T), using Monte Carlo simulations we show that the system\nundergoes a phase transition triggered by the destruction of the ordering of a\nnumber of layers. This partial phase transition is shown to be intimately\nrelated to the ground-state spin structure. We show why some layers undergo a\nphase transition while others do not. The Green's function method for non\ncollinear magnets is also carried out to investigate effects of quantum\nfluctuations. Non-uniform zero-point spin contractions and a crossover of layer\nmagnetizations at low T are shown and discussed.\n", "  The higher derivative corrections in double field theory are revisited to\nfirst order in $\\alpha'$. In first order perturbation theory around flat space,\nthe gauge algebra is $\\alpha'$ corrected, governed by two parameters $a, b$.\nOne parameter choice corresponds to bosonic string theory, another to heterotic\nstring theory. These results are generalized to second order in perturbation\ntheory by a Noether procedure. Using consistency conditions derived from the\nJacobi identity, it is shown that for general $a, b$ there is no generalized\nmetric formulation. A manifestly background independent formulation is instead\ngiven by a frame formalism, with $\\alpha'$-deformed frame transformations, as\nproposed by Marques and Nunez. Their construction is slightly generalized to an\n$\\alpha'$-deformed $GL(D)\\times GL(D)$ frame formalism. The perturbation theory\naround flat space is matched to second order with the results obtained by the\nNoether procedure. We also obtain a formulation based on the `non-symmetric'\nmetric ${\\cal E}$, the sum of metric and $b$-field. The transformations of\n${\\cal E}$ under $O(D,D)$ receive non-trivial $\\alpha'$ corrections, unless\n$a=-b$, in which case there is a generalized metric formulation, in agreement\nwith previous results in the literature.\n", "  We present a study of the magnetic dynamics associated with nanosecond scale\nmagnetic switching driven by the spin Hall effect in 3-terminal nanoscale\nmagnetic tunnel junctions (3T-MTJs) with in-plane magnetization. Utilizing fast\npulse measurements in a variety of material stacks and detailed micromagnetic\nsimulations, we demonstrate that this unexpectedly fast and reliable magnetic\nreversal is facilitated by the self-generated Oersted field, and the\nshort-pulse energy efficiency can be substantially enhanced by micromagnetic\ncurvature in the magnetic free layer. The sign of the Oersted field is\nessential for this enhancement --- in simulations in which we artificially\nimpose a field-like torque with a sign opposite to the effect of the Oersted\nfield, the result is a much slower and stochastic switching process that is\nreminiscent of the so-called incubation delay in conventional 2-terminal\nspin-torque-switched MTJs.\n", "  We present a simple autocorrelator for ultraviolet pulses based on two-photon\nconductivity in a bench-top fabricatable sapphire sensor. We perform\nmeasurements on femtosecond 226 - 278 nm ultraviolet pulses from the third and\nfourth harmonics of a standard 76 MHz titanium sapphire oscillator and\npicosecond 266 nm pulses from the fourth harmonic of a 1064 nm 50 MHz neodymium\nvanadate oscillator. Our device is sensitive to 2.6 pJ ultraviolet pulses with\npeak powers below 20 W. These results represent the lowest measured\nautocorrelation peak powers by over one order of magnitude for a system with no\nreference pulse in the deep ultraviolet ( < 300 nm). The autocorrelator can\npotentially support UV pulse lengths from 50 fs - 10's of picoseconds.\n", "  A popular regime in the NMSSM parameter space involves a light CP-odd Higgs\n$A_1$. This scenario has consequences for e.g. light singlino Dark Matter\nannihilating in the $A_1$-funnel. In order to confront the pseudoscalar to\nexperimental limits such as flavour observables, Upsilon decays or Beam-Dump\nexperiments, it is necessary to control the interactions of this particle with\nhadronic matter and derive the corresponding decays. The partonic description\ncannot be relied upon for masses close to $m_{A_1}\\sim1$GeV and we employ a\nchiral lagrangian, then extended to a spectator model for somewhat larger\nmasses, to describe the interplay of the CP-odd Higgs with hadrons.\nInterestingly, a mixing can develop between $A_1$ and neutral pseudoscalar\nmesons, leading to substantial hadronic decays and a coupling of $A_1$ to the\nchiral anomaly. Additionally, quartic $A_1$-meson couplings induce tri-meson\ndecays of the Higgs pseudoscalar. We investigate these effects and propose an\nestimate of the Higgs widths for masses below $m_{A_1}\\leq3$GeV. While we focus\non the case of the NMSSM, our results are applicable to a large class of\nmodels.\n", "  Considering a two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard spinor lattice with weak nearest\nneighbour interactions and no particle transfer between sites, we theoretically\nstudy the transport of energy from one initially excited dimer, to the rest of\nthe lattice. Beyond a critical interaction strength, low energy on-site\nexcitations are quickly dispersed throughout the array, while stronger\nexcitations are self trapped, resulting in localized energy breathers and\nsolitons. These structures are quasiparticle analogues to the discrete 2D\nsolitons in photonic lattices. Full many-body simulations additionally\ndemonstrate the localization of one-particle entropy.\n", "  The increased sensitivity of millimeter-wave facilities now makes possible\nthe detection of low amounts of gas in debris disks. Some of the gas-rich\ndebris disks harbor peculiar properties, with possible pristine gas and\nsecondary generated dust. The origin of the gas in these hybrid disks is\nstrongly debated and the current sample is too sparse to understand this\nphenomenon. More detections are necessary to increase the statistics on this\npopulation. Lying at the final stages of evolution of proto-planetary disks and\nat the beginning of the debris disk phase, these objects could provide new\ninsight into the processes involved in the making of planetary systems. We\ncarried out a deep survey of the 12CO(2-1) and 12CO(3-2) lines with the APEX\nand IRAM radiotelescopes in young debris disks selected according to hybrid\ndisk properties. The survey is complemented with a bibliographic study of the\nratio between the emission of the gas and the continuum (S_CO/F_cont) in CTTS,\nHerbig Ae, WTTS, hybrid, and debris disks. Our sub-mm survey comprises 25\nstars, including 17 new targets, and we increase the sensitivity limit by a\nfactor 2 on eight sources compared to similar published studies. We report a\n4sigma tentative detection of a double-peaked 12CO(2-1) line around HD23642; an\neclipsing binary located in the Pleiades. We also reveal a correlation between\nthe emission of the CO gas and the dust continuum from CTTS, Herbig Ae and few\ndebris disks. The observed trend of the gas to dust flux ratio suggests a\nconcurrent dissipation of the dust and gas components. Hybrid disks\nsystematically lie above this trend, suggesting that these systems may witness\na transient phase, when the dust has evolved more rapidly than the gas, with a\nflux ratio S_CO/F_cont enhanced by a factor of between 10 and 100 compared to\nstandard (proto-)planetary disks.\n", "  Two-dimensional solid state gaseous detector for thermal and cold neutrons is\ncreated. The detector has active area of 128 x 128 $mm^2$, $^{10}B$ neutron\nconverter, and gas chamber with thin windows. The resistive charge-division\nreadout is applied to determine the neutron position. The detector was tested\nusing $W-Be$ photoneutron source at the Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow.\nThe detector efficiency is estimated as ~4% at neutron wavelength $\\lambda =\n1.82 \\AA$ and 8% at $\\lambda = 8 \\AA$. The efficiency of the background\ndetection was less than $10^{-5}$ of that for thermal neutrons. The resulting\npulse height resolution and the spatial resolution are estimated as $\\approx\n15\\%$ and $\\approx 2.5 mm$, respectively.\n", "  We report the measurement of quark number susceptibilities (QNS) and their\ntemperature dependence from simulations of QCD with two flavours of light\ndynamical staggered quarks at finite temperature on 8 * 32^3 lattices. From the\nradius of convergence of the Taylor expansion we estimate the critical end\npoint. We use a Pade approximant to resum the series expansion and compute the\nequation of state at finite chemical potential, namely the baryon number\ndensity and its contribution to the pressure. We also report the isothermal\ncompressibility of QCD matter at finite baryon density. Finally we explore the\nfreezeout conditions for a measure of fluctuations. We examine some sources of\nsystematic and statistical errors in all of these measurements.\n", "  We establish a general map between Grassmann functionals for fermions and\nprobability or weight distributions for Ising spins. The equivalence between\nthe two formulations is based on identical transfer matrices and expectation\nvalues of products of observables. The map preserves locality properties and\ncan be realized for arbitrary dimensions. We present a simple example where a\nquantum field theory for free massless Dirac fermions in two-dimensional\nMinkowski space is represented by an asymmetric Ising model on a euclidean\nsquare lattice.\n", "  I review a selection of recent finite temperature lattice results of the past\nyears. First I discuss the extension of the equation of state towards high\ntemperatures and fi- nite densities, then I show recent results on the QCD\ntopological susceptibility at high temperatures and highlight its relevance for\ndark matter search.\n", "  We study the self energies of all particles which appear in a lattice\nregularization of supersymmetric QCD (${\\cal N}=1$). We compute, perturbatively\nto one-loop, the relevant two-point Green's functions using both the\ndimensional and the lattice regularizations. Our lattice formulation employs\nthe Wilson fermion acrion for the gluino and quark fields. The gauge group that\nwe consider is $SU(N_c)$ while the number of colors, $N_c$ and the number of\nflavors, $N_f$, are kept as generic parameters. We have also searched for\nrelations among the propagators which are computed from our one-loop results.\nWe have obtained analytic expressions for the renormalization functions of the\nquark field ($Z_\\psi$), gluon field ($Z_u$), gluino field ($Z_\\lambda$) and\nsquark field ($Z_{A_\\pm}$).\n  We present here results from dimensional regularization, relegating to a\nforthcoming publication our results along with a more complete list of\nreferences. Part of the lattice study regards also the renormalization of quark\nbilinear operators which, unlike the non-supersymmetric case, exhibit a rich\npattern of operator mixing at the quantum level.\n", "  Recently, the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) approach for calculating scattering\namplitudes has been extended beyond tree level. In this paper, we introduce a\nway of constructing CHY integrands for $\\Phi^3$ theory up to two loops from\nholomorphic forms on Riemann surfaces. We give simple rules for translating\nFeynman diagrams into the corresponding CHY integrands. As a complementary\nresult, we extend the $\\Lambda$-algorithm, originally introduced in\narXiv:1604.05373, to two loops. Using this approach, we are able to\nanalytically verify our prescription for the CHY integrands up to seven\nexternal particles at two loops. In addition, it gives a natural way of\nextending to higher-loop orders.\n", "  The CIII]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}1907, 1909 rest-frame UV emission doublet has\nrecently been detected in galaxies during the epoch of reionization (z > 6),\nwith high equivalent width (>10 {\\AA}, rest frame). Currently, it is possible\nto obtain much more detailed information for star-forming galaxies at\nsignificantly lower redshift. Accordingly, studies of their far-UV spectra are\nuseful for understanding the factors modulating the strength of CIII] emission.\nWe present the first statistical sample of CIII] emission measurements in\nstar-forming galaxies at z ~ 1. Our sample is drawn from the DEEP2 survey and\nspans the redshift 0.64 < z < 1.35 (<z> = 1.08). We find that the median\nequivalent width (EW) of individual CIII] detections in our sample (1.30 {\\AA})\nis much smaller than the typical value observed thus far at z > 6. Furthermore,\nout of 184 galaxies with coverage of CIII], only 40 have significant\ndetections. Galaxies with individual CIII] detections have bluer colors and\nlower luminosities on average than those without, implying that strong CIII]\nemitters are in general young and low-mass galaxies without significant dust\nextinction. Using stacked spectra, we further investigate how CIII] strength\ncorrelates with multiple galaxy properties (M_B, U-B, M*, star-formation rate,\nspecific star-formation rate) and rest-frame near-UV (FeII* and MgII) and\noptical [OIII] and H{\\beta}) emission line strengths. These results provide a\ndetailed picture of the physical environment in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1,\nand motivate future observations of strong CIII] emitters at similar redshifts.\n", "  We show that media with inhomogeneous defocusing cubic nonlinearity growing\ntoward the periphery can support a variety of stable vortex clusters nested in\na common localized envelope. Nonrotating symmetric clusters are built of an\neven number of vortices with opposite topological charges, located at equal\ndistances from the origin. Rotation makes the clusters strongly asymmetric, as\nthe centrifugal force shifts some vortices to the periphery, while others\napproach the origin, depending on the topological charge. We obtain such\nasymmetric clusters as stationary states in the rotating coordinate frame,\nidentify their existence domains, and show that the rotation may stabilize some\nof them.\n", "  The two dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides provide new\nopportunities in future valley based information processing and also provide\nideal platform to study excitonic effects. At the center of various device\nphysics toward their possible electronic and optoelectronic applications is\nunderstanding the dynamical evolution of various many particle electronic\nstates, especially exciton which dominates the optoelectronic response of TMDs,\nunder the novel context of valley degree of freedom. Here, we provide a brief\nreview of experimental advances in using helicity resolved ultrafast\nspectroscopy, especially ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy, to study the\ndynamical evolution of valley related many particle electronic states in\nsemiconducting monolayer transitional metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  The background underlying the $\\eta$-deformed $AdS_5\\times S^5$ sigma-model\nis known to satisfy a generalization of the IIB supergravity equations. Their\nsolutions are related by T-duality to solutions of type IIA supergravity with\nnon-isometric linear dilaton. We show how the generalized IIB supergravity\nequations can be naturally obtained from exceptional field theory. Within this\nmanifestly duality covariant formulation of maximal supergravity, the\ngeneralized IIB supergravity equations emerge upon imposing on the fields a\nsimple Scherk-Schwarz ansatz which respects the section constraint.\n", "  Non-leptonic $B$ decays into charmless final states offer an important\nlaboratory to study CP violation and the dynamics of strong interactions.\nParticularly interesting are $B^0_s\\to K^-K^+$ and $B^0_d\\to\\pi^-\\pi^+$ decays,\nwhich are related by the $U$-spin symmetry of strong interactions, and allow\nfor the extraction of CP-violating phases and tests of the Standard Model. The\ntheoretical precision is limited by $U$-spin-breaking corrections and\ninnovative methods are needed in view of the impressive future experimental\nprecision expected in the era of Belle II and the LHCb upgrade. We have\nrecently proposed a novel method to determine the $B_s^0$-$\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing\nphase $\\phi_s$ from the $B_s^0\\to K^-K^+$, $B_d^0\\to \\pi^-\\pi^+$ system, where\nsemileptonic $B^0_s\\to K^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$, $B^0_d\\to \\pi^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$\ndecays are a new ingredient and the theoretical situation is very favourable.\nWe discuss this strategy in detail, with a focus on penguin contributions as\nwell as exchange and penguin-annihilation topologies which can be probed by a\nvariety of non-leptonic $B$ decays into charmless final states. We show that a\ntheoretical precision as high as ${\\cal O}(0.5^\\circ)$ for $\\phi_s$ can be\nattained in the future, thereby offering unprecedented prospects for the search\nfor new sources of CP violation.\n", "  Light beams with orbital angular momentum (OAM) are convenient carriers of\nquantum information. They can be also used for imparting rotational motion to\nparticles and provide high resolution in imaging. Due to the conservation of\nOAM in parametric down-conversion (PDC), signal and idler photons generated at\nlow gain have perfectly anti-correlated OAM values. It is interesting to study\nthe OAM properties of high-gain PDC, where the same OAM modes can be populated\nwith large, but correlated, numbers of photons. Here we investigate the OAM\nspectrum of high-gain PDC and show that the OAM mode content can be controlled\nby varying the pump power and the configuration of the source. In our\nexperiment, we use a source consisting of two nonlinear crystals separated by\nan air gap. We discuss the OAM properties of PDC radiation emitted by this\nsource and suggest possible modifications.\n", "  We report a photoluminescence imaging system for locating single quantum\nemitters with respect to alignment features. Samples are interrogated in a 4~K\nclosed-cycle cryostat by a high numerical aperture (NA=0.9, 100$\\times$\nmagnification) objective that sits within the cryostat, enabling high\nefficiency collection of emitted photons without image distortions due to the\ncryostat windows. The locations of single InAs/GaAs quantum dots within a\n$>50$~$\\mu$m~$\\times$~50~$\\mu$m field of view are determined with\n$\\approx4.5$~nm uncertainty (one standard deviation) in a 1~s long acquisition.\nThe uncertainty is determined through a combination of a maximum likelihood\nestimate for localizing the quantum dot emission, and a cross-correlation\nmethod for determining the alignment mark center. This location technique can\nbe an important step in the high-throughput creation of nanophotonic devices\nthat rely upon the interaction of highly confined optical modes with single\nquantum emitters.\n", "  In a recent study of the Lambda(1405), the suppression of the strange-quark\ncontribution to the magnetic form factor was interpreted as the discovery of a\ndominant antikaon-nucleon composition for this low-lying state. We confirm this\nresult by calculating the light u- and d-quark contributions to the\nLambda(1405) magnetic form factor in lattice QCD in order to determine the\nextent to which their contributions support this exotic molecular description.\nDrawing on the recent graded-symmetry approach for the flavor-singlet\ncomponents of the Lambda(1405), the separation of connected and disconnected\ncontributions is performed in both the flavor-octet and singlet\nrepresentations. The relationship between light-quark contributions to the\nLambda(1405) magnetic form factor and the connected contributions of the\nnucleon magnetic form factors is established and compared with lattice\ncalculations of the same quantities, confirming the KN molecular structure of\nthe Lambda(1405) in lattice QCD.\n", "  Using density functional theory based calculations, we have carried out\nin-depth studies of effect of Co substitution on the magnetic properties of Ni\nand Pt-based shape memory alloys. We show the systematic variation of the total\nmagnetic moment, as a function of Co doping. A detailed analysis of evolution\nof Heisenberg exchange coupling parameters as a function of Co doping has been\npresented here. The strength of RKKY type of exchange interaction is found to\ndecay with the increase of Co doping.\n", "  We reconsider the long-range effects of the scattering of massless scalars\nand photons from a massive scalar object in quantum gravity. At the one-loop\nlevel, the relevant quantum mechanical corrections could be sorted into the\ngraviton double-cut contributions, massless-scalar double-cut contributions and\nphoton double-cut contributions. In arXiv:1410.7590 and 1609.07477 N.E.J.\nBjerrum-Bohr et al. have considered explicitly the implications of the graviton\ndouble-cut contributions on the gravitational bending of light and some\nclassical formulations of the equivalence principle, using the modern\ndouble-copy constructions and on-shell unitarity techniques. In this article,\ninstead we consider all three contributions and redo the analysis using the\ntraditional Feynman diagrammatic approach. Our results on the graviton\ndouble-cut contributions agree with the aforementioned references, which acts\nas a nontrivial check of previous computations. Furthermore, it turns out that\nthe massless-scalar double-cut contributions and the photon double-cut\ncontributions do leave non-vanishing quantum effects on the scattering\namplitudes and the gravitational bending of light. Yet, we find that the\ngeneral structure of the gravitational amplitudes and the quantum discrepancy\nof the equivalence principle suggested in the aforementioned references remain\nintact.\n", "  Based on the low-energy effective field theory of D-branes, the mass spectrum\nof an extended Standard Model with two-Higgs doublets used to generate all the\nmass terms is investigated. Besides the gauge bosons, the fermion mass spectrum\nis weighted by the Higgs VEVs with a partial hierarchy and the smallness of\nneutrino masses is exhibited. With reference to the known data, the involved\nscales of the model are approached.\n", "  In the present article the SPP propagation in an attenuating medium is\ninvestigated. The analytical calculations of the total electric-field Green's\ntensor of a metal-dielectric interface structure are provided and novel\nexplicit expressions for Green's tensor of a metal-dielectric interface are\npresented. The contribution of plasmons are obtained by evaluating the poles of\nthe reflection coefficient for p-polarized waves incident on the metal\ninterface. The emission pattern of a classical dipole located above air/silver\ninterface is studied. The relative intensity of the field to the field\nintensity in free space is studied for both normal and parallel orientations of\nthe dipole. The quantum optical properties of a quantum emitter coupled to a\nmetal surface are studied. For a quantum dot near a metal surface single photon\nemission is demonstrated using second-order correlation functions.\n", "  We investigate how ultracold atoms in double well potentials can be used to\nstudy and put bounds on models describing wave function collapse. We refer in\nparticular to the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, which is the\nmost well studied among dynamical reduction models. It modifies the Schrodinger\nequation in order to include the collapse of the wave function in its dynamics.\nWe consider Bose Josephson junctions, where ultracold bosons are trapped in a\ndouble well potential,since they can be experimentally controlled with high\naccuracy and are suited and used to study macroscopic quantum phenomena on\nscale of microns with a number of particles typically ranging from $\\sim\n10^2-10^3$ to $\\sim 10^5-10^6$. We study the CSL dynamics of three atomic\nstates showing macroscopic quantum coherence: the atomic coherent state, the\nsuperposition of two atomic coherent states, and the NOON state. We show that\nfor the last two states the suppression of quantum coherence induced by CSL\nmodel increases exponentially with the number of atoms. We observe that, in the\ncase of optically trapped atoms, the spontaneous photon emission of the atoms\ninduce a dynamics similar to the CSL one and we conclude that magnetically\ntrapped atoms may be more convenient to experimentally test the CSL model. We\nfinally discuss decoherence effects in order to provide reasonable estimates on\nthe bounds that it is (or it will) possible to obtain for the parameters of the\nCSL model in such class of experiments: as an example, we show that a NOON\nstate with $N \\sim 10^3$ with a coherence time of $\\sim 1$ s can constrain the\nCSL parameters in a region where the other systems presently cannot.\n", "  We study the scattering produced by a one dimensional hyperbolic step\npotential, which is exactly solvable and shows an unusual interest because of\nits asymmetric character. The analytic continuation of the scattering matrix in\nthe momentum representation has a branch cut and an infinite number of simple\npoles on the negative imaginary axis which are related with the so called\nanti-bound states. This model does not show resonances. Using the wave\nfunctions of the anti-bound states, we obtain supersymmetric (SUSY) partners\nwhich are the series of Rosen Morse II potentials. We have computed the Wigner\nreflection and transmission time delays for the hyperbolic step and such SUSY\npartners.Our results show that the more bound states a partner Hamiltonian has\nthe smaller is the time delay. We also have evaluated time delays for the\nhyperbolic step potential in the classical case and have obtained striking\nsimilitudes with the quantum case.\n", "  The discovery of the $D^\\ast_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ resonances in the\ncharmed-strange meson spectra revealed that formerly successful constituent\nquark models lose predictability in the vicinity of two-meson thresholds. The\nemergence of non-negligible effects due to meson loops requires an explicit\nevaluation of the interplay between $Q\\bar q$ and $(Q\\bar q)(q\\bar q)$ Fock\ncomponents. In contrast to the $c\\bar s$ sector, there is no experimental\nevidence of $J^P=0^+,1^+$ bottom-strange states yet. Motivated by recent\nlattice studies, in this work the heavy-quark partners of the\n$D_{s0}^\\ast(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states are analyzed within a heavy meson\nchiral unitary scheme. As a novelty, the coupling between the constituent quark\nmodel P-wave $\\bar B_s$ scalar and axial mesons and the $\\bar B^{(\\ast)}K$\nchannels is incorporated employing an effective interaction, consistent with\nheavy quark spin symmetry, constrained by the lattice energy levels.\n", "  We investigate the impact of a local random unitary noise on multipartite\nquantum states of an arbitrary dimension. We follow the dynamical approach, in\nwhich the single-particle unitaries are generated by local random Hamiltonians.\nAssuming short evolution time we derive a lower bound on the fidelity between\nan initial and the final state transformed by this type of noise. This result\nis based on averaging the Tamm-Mandelstam bound and holds for a wide class of\ndistributions of random Hamiltonians fulfilling specific symmetry conditions.\nIt is showed how the sensitivity of a given pure quantum state to the discussed\ntype of noise depends on the properties of single-particle and bipartite\nreduced states.\n", "  Hardware injections are simulated gravitational-wave signals added to the\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The detectors' test\nmasses are physically displaced by an actuator in order to simulate the effects\nof a gravitational wave. The simulated signal initiates a control-system\nresponse which mimics that of a true gravitational wave. This provides an\nend-to-end test of LIGO's ability to observe gravitational waves. The\ngravitational-wave analyses used to detect and characterize signals are\nexercised with hardware injections. By looking for discrepancies between the\ninjected and recovered signals, we are able to characterize the performance of\nanalyses and the coupling of instrumental subsystems to the detectors' output\nchannels. This paper describes the hardware injection system and the recovery\nof injected signals representing binary black hole mergers, a stochastic\ngravitational wave background, spinning neutron stars, and sine-Gaussians.\n", "  Direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are excellent candidates as seeds of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at $z \\gsim 6$. The formation of a\nDCBH requires a strong external radiation field to suppress $\\rm H_2$ formation\nand cooling in a collapsing gas cloud. Such strong field is not easily achieved\nby first stars or normal star-forming galaxies. Here we investigate a scenario\nin which the previously-formed DCBH can provide the necessary radiation field\nfor the formation of additional ones. Using one-zone model and the simulated\nDCBH Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) filtered through absorbing gas\ninitially having column density $N_{\\rm H}$, we derive the critical field\nintensity, $J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}$, to suppress $\\rm H_2$ formation and\ncooling. For the SED model with $N_{\\rm H}=1.3\\times10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$,\n$8.0\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $5.0\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, we obtain\n$J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}\\approx22$, 35 and 54, all much smaller than the critical\nfield intensity for normal star-forming galaxies ($J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}\\simgt\n1000$). X-ray photons from previously-formed DCBHs build up a high-$z$ X-ray\nbackground (XRB) that may boost the $J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}$. However, we find\nthat in the three SED models $J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}$ only increases to\n$\\approx80$, 170 and 390 respectively even when $\\dt{\\rho}_\\bullet$ reaches the\nmaximum value allowed by the present-day XRB level ($0.22, 0.034,\n0.006~M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$), still much smaller than the galactic value.\nAlthough considering the XRB from first galaxies may further increase $J_{\\rm\nLW}^{\\rm crit}$, we conclude that our investigation supports a scenario in\nwhich DCBH may be more abundant than predicted by models only including\ngalaxies as external radiation sources.\n", "  Adiabatic preparation of the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians in the\nclosed system limit is at the heart of adiabatic quantum computation, but in\nreality systems are always open. This motivates a natural comparison between,\non the one hand, adiabatic preparation of steady states of Lindbladian\ngenerators and, on the other hand, relaxation towards the same steady states\nsubject to the final Lindbladian of the adiabatic process. In this work we thus\nadopt the perspective that the goal is the most efficient possible preparation\nof such steady states, rather than ground states. Using known rigorous bounds\nfor the open-system adiabatic theorem and for mixing times, we are then led to\na disturbing conclusion that at first appears to doom efforts to build physical\nquantum annealers: relaxation seems to always converge faster than adiabatic\npreparation. However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time\nfor Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we\nshow that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation.\nTo test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and\nthe relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative\nquasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the\n\"spike\" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we\nfind that the answer to the \"which wins\" question depends for each model on the\ntemperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the \"spike\"\nproblem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an\nimportant role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure.\nThus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both\npure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation.\n", "  We study a D3-D5 system dual to a conformal field theory with a\ncodimension-one defect that separates regions where the ranks of the gauge\ngroups differ by $k$. With the help of this additional parameter, as observed\nby Nagasaki, Tanida and Yamaguchi, one can define a double scaling limit in\nwhich the quantum corrections are organized in powers of $\\lambda/k^2$, which\nshould allow to extrapolate results between weak and strong coupling regimes.\nIn particular we consider a radius $R$ circular Wilson loop placed at a\ndistance $L$, whose internal space orientation is given by an angle $\\chi$. We\ncompute its vacuum expectation value and show that, in the double scaling limit\nand for small $\\chi$ and small $L/R$, weak coupling results can be extrapolated\nto the strong coupling limit.\n", "  We investigate the single-particle and collective excitations of a Rashba\nspin-orbit coupled atomic Fermi gas with attractive interaction, loaded in a\ntwo dimensional (2D) square optical lattice, in the presence of an effective\nout-of-plane Zeeman field. Our numerical calculations show that the many body\nphysics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side is strongly modified\ncompared to the Fermi gases in the free space. The physics behind this\nstatement is in the fact that without a lattice structure, if the value of the\nZeeman field does not exceed some threshold value, the minimum of the\nsingle-particle ground state energy is infinitely degenerate and occurs along a\nring in $(k_x,k_y)$ space. This reduces the effective dimensionality; the\nsingle-particle density of states is a constant at low energies, and the\nmolecular pairing is strongly enhanced. In contrast to the continuum, in the 2D\nlattice case there are only four degenerate minima, and because of that, the\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) in optical lattices gives rise to unusual properties\nentirely different from the continuum. For example, in the continuum, the\npairing gap as well as the condensate fraction are strongly enhanced by the SOC\nstrength on the BCS side. In the presence of lattice geometry the gap and the\ncondensate fraction increase as a function of the SOC strength only at the\nsmall fillings and weak attraction limit. Moreover, we found that the speed of\nsound also exhibits different behavior: in the 3D and 2D continuum, the slope\nof the Goldstone mode decreases as a function of the SOC strength, while in the\nlattice case the speed of sound increases monotonically with SOC strength.\n", "  Transverse photo-induced voltage (TPIV) in 25nm-thick Au film with random\nholes with 100 nm in diameter is measured for linearly, circularly and\nelliptically polarized light. By rotating the major axis of ellipse of the\nlight, TPIV exhibits specific pattern depending on polarization. The\nexperimental results are readily reproduced by assuming that the angular\nmomentum transfer from the light beam to the film is responsible for TPIV. A\nnovel ellipticity meter is proposed based on this mechanism.\n", "  Biased sampling of collective variables is widely used to accelerate rare\nevents in molecular simulations and to explore free energy surfaces. However,\ncomputational efficiency of these methods decreases with increasing number of\ncollective variables, which severely limits the predictive power of the\nenhanced sampling approaches. Here we propose a method called Temperature\nAccelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS) that combines temperature accelerated\nmolecular dynamics with umbrella sampling and metadynamics to sample the\ncollective variable space in an efficient manner. The presented method can\nsample a large number of collective variables and is advantageous for\ncontrolled exploration of broad and unbound free energy basins. TASS is also\nshown to achieve quick free energy convergence and is practically usable with\nab initio molecular dynamics techniques.\n", "  The technique of almost-balanced weak values amplification (ABWV) was\nrecently proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116: 100803 (2016)]. We demonstrate this\ntechnique using a modified Sagnac interferometer, where the counter-propagating\nbeams are spatially separated. The separation between the two beams provides\nadditional amplification, with respect to using colinear beams in a Sagnac\ninterferometer. As a demonstration of the technique, we perform measurements of\nthe angular velocity in one of the mirrors of the interferometer. Within the\nsame setup, the weak-value amplification technique is also performed for\ncomparison. Much higher amplification factors can be obtained using the\nalmost-balanced weak values technique, with the best one achieved in our\nexperiments being as high as $1.2\\times10^7$. In addition, the amplification\nfactor monotonically increases with decreasing post-selection phase for the\nABWV case in our experiments, which is not the case for weak-value\namplification at small post-selection phases.\n", "  A three-orbital-model approach for studying spin wave excitations in the\nstrongly spin-orbit coupled layered perovskite iridates is presented which\nprovides a unified description of magnetic excitations as well as the\nelectronic band structure. The calculated spin wave dispersions with realistic\nthree-band parameters are in excellent agreement with the RIXS data for\niridates, including the strong AF zone boundary dispersion in the single-layer\ncompound $\\rm Sr_2 Ir O_4$ and the large anisotropy gap in the bilayer compound\n$\\rm Sr_3 Ir_2 O_7$. The RIXS spin wave data is shown to provide evidence of\nmixing between the J=1/2 and 3/2 sectors in both compounds.\n", "  We study the spatiotemporal dynamics of a ring of nonlocally coupled\nFitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators in the bistable regime. A new type of chimera\npatterns has been found in the noise-free network and when isolated elements do\nnot oscillate. The region of existence of these structures has been explored\nwhen the coupling range and the coupling strength between the network elements\nare varied.\n", "  The indirect exchange interaction between magnetic impurities located in the\nbulk of a two-dimensional topological insulator decays exponentially with the\ndistance. The indirect exchange interaction for magnetic impurities mediated by\nthe helical states at the edge of the topological insulator demonstrates\nbehaviour which is typical for the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in\na one-dimensional metal. We have shown that interference between the bulk and\nedge states in the two-dimensional topological insulator results in existence\nof the unusual contribution to the indirect exchange interaction which, on the\none hand, decays exponentially with a distance at the length scale controlled\nby the Fermi energy of the edge states and, on the other hand, oscillates with\ndistance along the helical edge with the period determined by the Fermi wave\nlength. We found that this interference contribution to the indirect exchange\ninteraction becomes dominant for such configurations of two magnetic impurities\nwhen one of them is situated close to the helical edge whereas the other one is\nlocated far away in the bulk.\n", "  Patterned graphene, as an atomically thin layer, supports localized surface\nplasmon-polaritons (LSPPs) at mid-infrared or far-infrared frequencies. This\nprovides a pronounced optical force/torque in addition to large optical cross\nsections and will make it an ideal candidate for optical manipulation. Here, we\nstudy the optical force and torque exerted by a linearly polarized plane wave\non circular and oval graphene flakes. Whereas the torque vanishes for circular\nflakes, the finite torque allows rotating and orienting oval flakes relative to\nthe electric field polarization. Depending on the wavelength, the alignment is\neither perpendicular or parallel. In our contribution, we rely on full-wave\nnumerical simulation but also on an analytical model that treats the graphene\nflakes in dipole approximation. The presented results reveal a good level of\ncontrol on the spatial alignment of graphene flakes subjected to far-infrared\nillumination.\n", "  Semi-Dirac semimetal is a material exhibiting linear band dispersion in one\ndirection and quadratic band dispersion in the orthogonal direction and,\ntherefore, hosts massless and massive fermions at the same point in the\nmomentum space. While a number of interesting physical properties have been\npredicted in semi-Dirac semimetals, it has been rare to realize such materials\nin condensed matters. Based on the fact that some honeycomb materials are\neasily oxidized or chemically absorb other atoms, here, we theoretically\npropose an approach of modifying their band structures by covalent addition of\ngroup-VI elements and strain engineering. We predict a silicene oxide with\nchemical formula of Si2O to be a candidate of semi-Dirac semimetal. Our\napproach is backed by the analysis and understanding of the effect of p-orbital\nfrustration on the band structure of the graphene-like materials.\n", "  We describe how unbounded three--form fluxes can lead to families of $AdS_3\n\\times S_7$ vacua, with constant dilaton profiles, in the $USp(32)$ model with\n\"brane supersymmetry breaking\" and in the $U(32)$ 0'B model, if their\n(projective--)disk dilaton tadpoles are taken into account. We also describe\nhow, in the $SO(16) \\times SO(16)$ heterotic model, if the torus vacuum energy\n$\\Lambda$ is taken into account, unbounded seven--form fluxes can support\nsimilar $AdS_7 \\times S_3$ vacua, while unbounded three--form fluxes, when\ncombined with internal gauge fields, can support $AdS_3 \\times S_7$ vacua,\nwhich continue to be available even if $\\Lambda$ is neglected. In addition,\nspecial gauge field fluxes can support, in the $SO(16) \\times SO(16)$ heterotic\nmodel, a set of $AdS_{n}\\times S_{10-n}$ vacua, for all $n=2,..,8$. String loop\nand $\\alpha'$ corrections appear under control when large form fluxes are\nallowed.\n", "  The topological nature of Weyl semimetals (WSMs) is corroborated by the\npresence of chiral surface states, which connect the projections of the bulk\nWeyl points by Fermi arcs (FAs). We study a bilayer structure realized by\nintroducing a thin insulating spacer into a bulk WSM. Employing a\nself-consistent mean-field description of the interlayer Coulomb interaction,\nwe propose that this system can develop an interlayer electron-hole pair\ncondensate. The formation of this excitonic condensate leads to partial gapping\nof the FA dispersion. We obtain the dependence of the energy gap and the\ncritical temperature on the model parameters, finding, in particular, a linear\nscaling of these quantities with the separation between the Weyl points in\nmomentum space. A detrimental role is played by the curvature of the FAs,\nalthough the pairing persists for moderately small curvature. A signature of\nthe condensate is the modification of the quantum oscillations involving the\nsurface FAs.\n", "  A fully stabilized mid-infrared optical frequency comb spanning from 2.9 to\n3.4 um is described. The comb is based on half-harmonic generation in a\nfemtosecond optical parametric oscillator, which transfers the high phase\ncoherence of a fully stabilized near-infrared Er-doped fiber laser comb to the\nmid-infrared region. The method is simple, as no phase-locked loops or\nreference lasers are needed. Precise locking of optical frequencies of the\nmid-infrared comb to the pump comb is experimentally verified at sub-20 mHz\nlevel, which corresponds to a fractional statistical uncertainty of 2x10-16 at\nthe center frequency of the mid-infrared comb. The fully stabilized\nmid-infrared comb is an ideal tool for high-precision molecular spectroscopy,\nas well as for optical frequency metrology in the mid-infrared region, which is\ndifficult to access with other stabilized frequency comb techniques.\n", "  This paper describes simulation analyses on beam and laser (X-ray)-driven\naccelerations in effective nanotube models obtained from Vsim and EPOCH codes.\nExperimental setups to detect wakefields are also outlined with accelerator\nfacilities at Fermilab and NIU. In the FAST facility, the electron beamline was\nsuccessfully commissioned at 50 MeV and it is being upgraded toward higher\nenergies for electron accelerator R&D. The 50 MeV injector beamline of the\nfacility is used for X-ray crystal-channeling radiation with a diamond target.\nIt has been proposed to utilize the same diamond crystal for a channeling\nacceleration POC test. Another POC experiment is also designed for the NIU\naccelerator lab with time-resolved electron diffraction. Recently, a stable\ngeneration of single-cycle laser pulses with tens of Petawatt power based on\nthin film compression (TFC) technique has been investigated for target normal\nsheath acceleration (TNSA) and radiation pressure acceleration (RPA). The\nexperimental plan with a nanometer foil is discussed with an available test\nfacility such as Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear Physics (ELI-NP).\n", "  The internal excitation of nuclei after multi-nucleon transfer is estimated\nby using the time-dependent mean-field theory. Transfer probabilities for each\nchannel as well as the energy loss after re-separation are calculated. By\ncombining these two informations, we show that the excitation energy\ndistribution of the transfer fragments can be obtained separately for the\ndifferent transfer channels. The method is applied to the reaction involving a\n$^{238}$U beam on a $^{12}$C target, which has recently been measured at GANIL.\nIt is shown that the excitation energy calculated with the microscopic theory\ncompares well with the experimental observation, provided that the competition\nwith fusion is properly taken into account. The reliability of the excitation\nenergy is further confirmed by the comparison with the phenomenological HIPSE\nmodel at higher center of mass energies.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the classification of the gauge transformations in\nthe Euler top system using the generalized classical Hamiltonian dynamics of\nNambu. In this framework the Euler equations of motion are bi-Hamiltonian and\n$SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ linear combinations of the two Hamiltonians leave the\nequations of motion invariant, although belonging to inequivalent Lie-Poisson\nstructures. Here we give the explicit form of the Hamiltonian vector fields\nassociated to the components of the angular momentum for every single\nLie-Poisson structure including both the asymmetric rigid bodies and its\nsymmetric limits. We also give a detailed classification of the different\nLie-Poisson structures recovering all the ones reported previously in the\nliterature.\n", "  The increasing threat raised by space debris led to the development of\ndifferent mathematical models and approaches to investigate the dynamics of\nsmall particles orbiting around the Earth. Such models and methods strongly\ndepend on the altitude of the objects above Earth's surface, since the strength\nof the different forces acting on an Earth orbiting object (geopotential,\natmospheric drag, lunar and solar attractions, solar radiation pressure, etc.)\nvaries with the altitude of the debris.\n  In this review, our focus is on presenting different analytical and numerical\napproaches employed in modern studies of the space debris problem. We start by\nconsidering a model including the geopotential, solar and lunar gravitational\nforces and the solar radiation pressure. We summarize the equations of motion\nusing different formalisms: Cartesian coordinates, Hamiltonian formulation\nusing Delaunay and epicyclic variables, Milankovitch elements. Some of these\nmethods lead in a straightforward way to the analysis of resonant motions. In\nparticular, we review results found recently about the dynamics near tesseral,\nsecular and semi-secular resonances.\n  As an application of the above methods, we proceed to analyze a timely\nsubject namely the possible causes for the onset of chaos in space debris\ndynamics. Precisely, we discuss the phenomenon of overlapping of resonances,\nthe effect of a large area-to-mass ratio, the influence of lunisolar secular\nresonances.\n  We conclude with a short discussion about the effect of the dissipation due\nto the atmospheric drag and we provide a list of minor effects, which could\ninfluence the dynamics of space debris.\n", "  We reformulate the heptagon cluster bootstrap to take advantage of the\nSteinmann relations, which require certain double discontinuities of any\namplitude to vanish. These constraints vastly reduce the number of functions\nneeded to bootstrap seven-point amplitudes in planar $\\mathcal{N} = 4$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, making higher-loop contributions to these\namplitudes more computationally accessible. In particular, dual superconformal\nsymmetry and well-defined collinear limits suffice to determine uniquely the\nsymbols of the three-loop NMHV and four-loop MHV seven-point amplitudes. We\nalso show that at three loops, relaxing the dual superconformal ($\\bar{Q}$)\nrelations and imposing dihedral symmetry (and for NMHV the absence of spurious\npoles) leaves only a single ambiguity in the heptagon amplitudes. These results\npoint to a strong tension between the collinear properties of the amplitudes\nand the Steinmann relations.\n", "  In this paper, we attempt to build an unified model with democratic texture,\nthat have some unification between $Y_{\\nu}$ and $Y_{u}$. Since the $S_{3L}\n\\times S_{3R}$ flavor symmetry is chiral, the unified gauge group is assumed to\nbe Pati-Salam type $SU(4)_{c} \\times SU(2)_{L} \\times SU(2)_{R}$. The flavor\nsymmetry breaking scheme is considered to be $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R} \\to S_{2L}\n\\times S_{2R} \\to 0$. In this picture, the four-zero texture is desirable for\nrealistic mass and mixings. This texture is realized by a specific\nrepresentation for the second breaking of the $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R}$ flavor\nsymmetry.\n  Assuming only renormalizable Yukawa interactions, type-I seesaw mechanism,\nand neglecting $CP$ phases for simplicity, the right-handed neutrino mass\nmatrix $M_{R}$ can be reconstructed from low energy input values. Numerical\nanalysis shows that the texture of $M_{R}$ basically behaves like the\n\"waterfall texture\". Since $M_{R}$ tends to be the \"cascade texture\" in the\ndemocratic texture approach, a model with type-I seesaw and up-type Yukawa\nunification $Y_{\\nu} \\simeq Y_{u}$ basically requires fine-tunings between\nparameters. Therefore, it seems to be more realistic to consider universal\nwaterfall textures for both $Y_{f}$ and $M_{R}$, e.g., by the radiative mass\ngeneration or the Froggatt--Nielsen mechanism.\n  Moreover, analysis of eigenvalues shows that the lightest mass eigenvalue\n$M_{R1}$ is too light to achieve successful thermal leptogenesis. Although the\nresonant leptogenesis might be possible, it also requires fine-tunings of\nparameters.\n", "  We consider a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate trapped in an array of\ntwo-well systems with an arbitrary orientations of the dipoles relative to the\nsystem's axis. The system can be built as a chain of local traps sliced into\ntwo parallel lattices by a repelling laser sheet. It is modelled by a pair of\ncoupled discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations, with dipole-dipole self- and\ncross-interactions. When the dipoles are not polarized perpendicular or\nparallel to the lattice, the cross-interaction is asymmetric, replacing the\nfamiliar symmetric two-component discrete solitons by two new species of\ncross-symmetric ones, on-site- and off-site-centered, which are strongly\naffected by the orientation of the dipoles and separation between the parallel\nlattices. A very narrow region of intermediate asymmetric discrete solitons is\nfound at the boundary between the on- and off-site families. Two different\ntypes of solitons in the $\\mathcal{PT}$%-symmetric version of the system are\nconstructed too, and stability areas are identified for them.\n", "  Change of the energy characteristics of muon bundles with an increase of the\nprimary cosmic ray particles energy can be a key to solving the problem of muon\nexcess in the extensive air showers (EAS) observed in a number of experiments.\nIn this work the data on the energy deposit of multi-muon events in a wide\nrange of zenith angles (and as a consequence in a wide range of primary\nparticles energies) obtained with NEVOD-DECOR setup over a long time period are\npresented. The experimental data are compared with the results of simulations\nof EAS muon component performed using CORSIKA code.\n", "  The abundance of cosmic voids can be described by an analogue of halo mass\nfunctions for galaxy clusters. In this work, we explore a number of void mass\nfunctions: from those based on excursion-set theory to new mass functions\nobtained by modifying halo mass functions. We show how different void mass\nfunctions vary in their predictions for the largest void expected in an\nobservational volume, and compare those predictions to observational data. Our\nextreme-value formalism is shown to be a new practical tool for testing void\ntheories against simulation and observation.\n", "  We investigate the spectrum of the SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f$ = 2 flavors\nof fermions in the fundamental representation, in the continuum, using lattice\nsimulations. This model provides a minimal template which has been used for\ndifferent strongly coupled extensions of the Standard Model ranging from\ncomposite (Goldstone) Higgs models to intriguing types of dark matter\ncandidates, such as the SIMPs. Here we will focus on the composite Goldstone\nHiggs paradigm, for which this model provides a minimal UV complete realization\nin terms of a new strong sector with fermionic matter. After introducing the\nrelevant Lattice methods used in our simulations, we will discuss our numerical\nresults. We show that this model features a SU(4)/Sp(4) $\\sim$ SO(6)/SO(5)\nflavor symmetry breaking pattern, and estimate the value of its chiral\ncondensate. Finally, we present our results for the mass spectrum of the\nlightest spin one and zero resonances, analogue to the QCD $\\rho$, $a_1$,\n$\\sigma$, $\\eta'$, $a_0$ resonances, which are relevant for searches of new,\nexotic resonances at the LHC.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenide IrTe2 has attracted attention because of\nstriped lattice, charge ordering and superconductivity. We have investigated\nthe surface structure of IrTe2, using low energy electron diffraction (LEED)\nand scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). A complex striped lattice modulations\nas a function of temperature is observed, which shows hysteresis between\ncooling and warming. While the bulk 5x1 and 8x1 phases appear at high\ntemperatures, the surface ground state has the 6x1 phase, not seen in the bulk,\nand the surface transition temperatures are distinct from the bulk. The broken\nsymmetry at the surface creates a quite different phase diagram, with the\ncoexistence of several periodicities resembling devil's staircase behavior.\n", "  Williams and Beer (2010) proposed a nonnegative mutual information\ndecomposition, based on the construction of information gain lattices, which\nallows separating the information that a set of variables contains about\nanother into components interpretable as the unique information of one\nvariable, or redundant and synergy components. In this work we extend the\nframework of Williams and Beer (2010) focusing on the lattices that underpin\nthe decomposition. We generalize the type of constructible lattices and examine\nthe relations between the terms in different lattices, for example relating\nbivariate and trivariate decompositions. We point out that, in information gain\nlattices, redundancy components are invariant across decompositions, but unique\nand synergy components are decomposition-dependent. Exploiting the connection\nbetween different lattices we propose a procedure to construct, in the general\nmultivariate case, information decompositions from measures of synergy or\nunique information. We introduce an alternative type of mutual information\ndecompositions based on information loss lattices, with the role and invariance\nproperties of redundancy and synergy components exchanged with respect to gain\nlattices. We study the correspondence between information gain and information\nloss lattices and we define dual decompositions that allow overcoming the\nintrinsic asymmetry between invariant and decomposition-dependent components,\nwhich hinders the consistent joint characterization of synergy and redundancy.\n", "  Context. The dynamics of the flaring loops in active region (AR) 11429 are\nstudied. The observed dynamics consist of several evolution stages of the\nflaring loop system during both the ascending and descending phases of the\nregistered M-class flare. The dynamical properties can also be classified by\ndifferent types of magnetic reconnection, related plasma ejection and aperiodic\nflows, quasi-periodic oscillatory motions, and rapid temperature and density\nchanges, among others. The focus of the present paper is on a specific time\ninterval during the ascending (pre-flare) phase. Aims. The goal is to\nunderstand the quasi-periodic behavior in both space and time of the magnetic\nloop structures during the considered time interval. Methods.We have studied\nthe characteristic location, motion, and periodicity properties of the flaring\nloops by examining space-time diagrams and intensity variation analysis along\nthe coronal magnetic loops using AIA intensity and HMI magnetogram images (from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)). Results. We detected bright plasma blobs\nalong the coronal loop during the ascending phase of the solar flare, the\nintensity variations of which clearly show quasi-periodic behavior. We also\ndetermined the periods of these oscillations. Conclusions. Two different\ninterpretations are presented for the observed dynamics. Firstly, the\noscillations are interpreted as the manifestation of non-fundamental harmonics\nof longitudinal standing acoustic oscillations driven by the thermodynamically\nnonequilibrium background (with time variable density and temperature). The\nsecond possible interpretation we provide is that the observed bright blobs\ncould be a signature of a strongly twisted coronal loop that is kink unstable.\n", "  Many models of inflation driven by vector fields alone have been known to be\nplagued by pathological behaviors, namely ghost and/or gradient instabilities.\nIn this work, we seek a new class of vector-driven inflationary models that\nevade all of the mentioned instabilities. We build our analysis on the\nGeneralized Proca Theory with an extension to three vector fields to realize\nisotropic expansion. We obtain the conditions required for quasi de-Sitter\nsolutions to be an attractor analogous to the standard slow-roll one and those\nfor their stability at the level of linearized perturbations. Identifying the\nremedy to the existing unstable models, we provide a simple example and\nexplicitly show its stability. This significantly broadens our knowledge on\nvector inflationary scenarios, reviving potential phenomenological interests\nfor this class of models.\n", "  It is argued that the superposition approach, where partons are independently\nemitted from longitudinally extended sources in the early stage, is fully\ncompatible with the experimental results for the forward-backward multiplicity\ncorrelations in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76 \\textrm{ TeV}$. The\npertinent correlation analysis is based on the PhD Thesis of Ref. [1], which\nincludes an unpublished analysis of data taken by the ALICE Collaboration. Our\ncalculations show that in the experimentally covered pseudorapidity range\n$\\Delta \\eta=1.2$, the initial sources in the backward and forward bins are\nmaximally correlated, which complies to the string-like interpretation of the\nunderlying early-stage production mechanism.\n", "  In this paper we review recent progress in hadron structure using lattice QCD\nsimulations, with main focus in the evaluation of nucleon matrix elements. We\nhighlight developments that may guide new Physics searches, such as the scalar\nand tensor charges, as well as, the neutron electric dipole moment.\n", "  We derive a mean-field approximation for the macroscopic dynamics of large\nnetworks of pulse-coupled theta neurons in order to study the effects of\ndifferent network degree distributions, as well as degree correlations\n(assortativity). Using the ansatz of Ott and Antonsen (Chaos, 19 (2008)\n037113), we obtain a reduced system of ordinary differential equations\ndescribing the mean-field dynamics, with significantly lower dimensionality\ncompared with the complete set of dynamical equations for the system. We find\nthat, for sufficiently large networks and degrees, the dynamical behavior of\nthe reduced system agrees well with that of the full network. This dimensional\nreduction allows for an efficient characterization of system phase transitions\nand attractors. For networks with tightly peaked degree distributions, the\nmacroscopic behavior closely resembles that of fully connected networks\npreviously studied by others. In contrast, networks with scale-free degree\ndistributions exhibit different macroscopic dynamics due to the emergence of\ndegree dependent behavior of different oscillators. For nonassortative networks\n(i.e., networks without degree correlations) we observe the presence of a\nsynchronously firing phase that can be suppressed by the presence of either\nassortativity or disassortativity in the network. We show that the results\nderived here can be used to analyze the effects of network topology on\nmacroscopic behavior in neuronal networks in a computationally efficient\nfashion.\n", "  We address the effects of chain connectivity on electrostatic fluctuations in\npolyelectrolyte solutions using a field-theoretic, renormalized Gaussian\nfluctuation (RGF) theory. As in simple electrolyte solutions (Z.-G. Wang, Phys.\nRev. E. {\\bf 81}, 021501 (2010)), the RGF provides a unified theory for\nelectrostatic fluctuations, accounting for both dielectric and charge\ncorrelation effects in terms of the self-energy. Unlike simple ions, the\npolyelectrolyte self energy depends intimately on the chain conformation, and\nour theory naturally provides a self-consistent determination of the response\nof intramolecular chain structure to polyelectrolyte and salt concentrations.\nThe theory captures the expected scaling behavior of chain size from the dilute\nto semi-dilute regimes; by properly accounting for chain structure the theory\nprovides improved estimates of the self energy in dilute solution and correctly\npredicts the eventual $N$-independence of the critical temperature and\nconcentration of salt-free solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes. We show that\nthe self energy can be interpreted in terms of an infinite-dilution energy\n$\\mu^\\text{el}_{m,0}$ and a finite concentration correlation correction\n$\\mu^\\text{corr}$ which tends to cancel out the former with increasing\nconcentration.\n", "  We discuss synchronization patterns in networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo and Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire oscillators coupled in a two-dimensional toroidal geometry.\nCommon feature between the two models is the presence of fast and slow\ndynamics, a typical characteristic of neurons. Earlier studies have\ndemonstrated that both models when coupled nonlocally in one-dimensional ring\nnetworks produce chimera states for a large range of parameter values. In this\nstudy, we give evidence of a plethora of two-dimensional chimera patterns of\nvarious shapes including spots, rings, stripes, and grids, observed in both\nmodels, as well as additional patterns found mainly in the FitzHugh-Nagumo\nsystem. Both systems exhibit multistability: For the same parameter values,\ndifferent initial conditions give rise to different dynamical states.\nTransitions occur between various patterns when the parameters (coupling range,\ncoupling strength, refractory period, and coupling phase) are varied. Many\npatterns observe in the two models follow similar rules. For example the\ndiameter of the rings grows linearly with the coupling radius.\n", "  No-insulation (NI) REBCO magnets have many advantages. They are\nself-protecting, therefore do not need quench detection and protection which\ncan be very challenging in a high Tc superconducting magnet. Moreover, by\nremoving insulation and allowing thinner copper stabilizer, NI REBCO magnets\nhave significantly higher engineering current density and higher mechanical\nstrength. On the other hand, NI REBCO magnets have drawbacks of long magnet\ncharging time and high field-ramp-loss. In principle, these drawbacks can be\nmitigated by managing the turn-to-turn contact resistivity (Rc). Evidently the\nfirst step toward managing Rc is to establish a reliable method of accurate Rc\nmeasurement. In this paper, we present experimental Rc measurements of REBCO\ntapes as a function of mechanical load up to 144 MPa and load cycles up to 14\ntimes. We found that Rc is in the range of 26-100 uOhm-cm2; it decreases with\nincreasing pressure, and gradually increases with number of load cycles. The\nresults are discussed in the framework of Holm's electric contact theory.\n", "  We present an elementary argument that one can shield linearised\ngravitational fields using linearised gravitational fields. This is done by\nusing third-order potentials for the metric, which avoids the need to solve\nsingular equations in shielding or gluing constructions for the linearised\nmetric.\n", "  The full development of mono- or multi-dimensional time-resolved spectroscopy\ntechniques incorporating optical activity signals has been strongly hampered by\nthe challenge of identifying the small chiral signals over the large achiral\nbackground. Here we propose a new methodology to isolate chiral signals\nremoving the achiral background from two commonly used configurations for\nperforming two dimensional optical spectroscopy, known as BOXCARS and GRadient\nAssisted Photon Echo Spectroscopy (GRAPES). It is found that in both cases an\nachiral signal from an isotropic system can be completely eliminated by small\nmanipulations of the relative angles between the linear polarizations of the\nfour input laser pulses. Starting from the formulation of a perturbative\nexpansion of the signal in the angle between the beams and the propagation\naxis, we derive analytic expressions that can be used to estimate how to change\nthe polarization angles of the four pulses to minimize achiral contributions in\nthe studied configurations. The generalization to any other possible\nexperimental configurations has also been discussed. %We derive analytic\nexpressions to changes required to the polarizations in terms of a perturbative\nexpansion in the angle between the beams and the colinear axis. We also\nnumerically estimate higher order coefficients which cover arbitrarily large\nangles and thus any experimental configuration.\n", "  The liquid droplet formula is applied to an analysis of the properties of\ngeometrical (anti)clusters formed in SU(2) gluodynamics by the Polyakov loops\nof the same sign. Using this approach, we explain the phase transition in SU(2)\ngluodynamics as a transition between two liquids during which one of the liquid\ndroplets (the largest cluster of a certain Polyakov loop sign) experiences a\ncondensation, while the droplet of another liquid (the next to the largest\ncluster of the opposite sign of Polyakov loop) evaporates. The clusters of\nsmaller sizes form two accompanying gases, which behave oppositely to their\nliquids. The liquid droplet formula is used to analyze the size distributions\nof the gaseous (anti)clusters. The fit of these distributions allows us to\nextract the temperature dependence of surface tension and the value of Fisher\ntopological exponent $\\tau$ for both kinds of gaseous clusters. It is shown\nthat the surface tension coeficient of gaseous (anti)clusters can serve as an\norder parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in SU(2) gluodynamics.\nThe Fisher topological exponent $\\tau$ of clusters and anticlusters is found to\nhave the same value $1.806 \\pm 0.008$. This value disagrees with the famous\nFisher droplet model, but it agrees well with an exactly solvable model of the\nnuclear liquid-gas phase transition. This finding may evidence for the fact\nthat the SU(2) gluodynamics and this exactly solvable model of nuclear\nliquid-gas phase transition are in the same universality class.\n", "  A brief review of recent studies on suppression of bottomonia in an\nanisotropic quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC is\npresented. A reasonable agreement between the model predictions for the\ninclusive $R_{\\rm AA}$ suppression factor and the preliminary CMS experimental\ndata is found. The values of the shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio\nextracted from the comparison with the data lie between one and two times the\ngauge/gravity duality lower bound. These values agree very well with the fluid\ndynamical fits to the light hadron correlation data and confirm that the\nquark-gluon plasma is a nearly-perfect fluid.\n", "  We investigate the formation and early evolution of star clusters assuming\nthat they form from a turbulent starless clump of given mass bounded inside a\nparent self-gravitating molecular cloud characterized by a particular mass\nsurface density. As a first step we assume instantaneous star cluster formation\nand gas expulsion. We draw our initial conditions from observed properties of\nstarless clumps. We follow the early evolution of the clusters up to 20 Myr,\ninvestigating effects of different star formation efficiencies, primordial\nbinary fractions and eccentricities and primordial mass segregation levels. We\ninvestigate clumps with initial masses of $M_{\\rm cl}=3000\\:{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nembedded in ambient cloud environments with mass surface densities,\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm cloud}=0.1$ and $1\\:{\\rm g\\:cm^{-2}}$. We show that these models\nof fast star cluster formation result, in the fiducial case, in clusters that\nexpand rapidly, even considering only the bound members. Clusters formed from\nhigher $\\Sigma_{\\rm cloud}$ environments tend to expand more quickly, so are\nsoon larger than clusters born from lower $\\Sigma_{\\rm cloud}$ conditions. To\nform a young cluster of a given age, stellar mass and mass surface density,\nthese models need to assume a parent molecular clump that is many times denser,\nwhich is unrealistic compared to observed systems. We also show that in these\nmodels the initial binary properties are only slightly modified by\ninteractions, meaning that binary properties, e.g., at 20 Myr, are very similar\nto those at birth. With this study we set up the basis of future work where we\nwill investigate more realistic models of star formation compared to this\ninstantaneous, baseline case.\n", "  Solid-state nanopores are promising tools for single molecule detection of\nboth DNA and proteins. In this study, we investigate the patterns of ionic\ncurrent blockades as DNA translocates into or out of the geometric confinement\nof such conically shaped pores. We studied how the geometry of a nanopore\naffects the detected ionic current signal of a translocating DNA molecule over\na wide range of salt concentration. The blockade level in the ionic current\ndepends on the translocation direction at a high salt concentration, and at\nlower salt concentrations we find a non-intuitive ionic current decrease and\nincrease within each single event for the DNA translocations exiting from\nconfinement. We use recently developed DNA rulers with markers and finite\nelement calculations to explain our observations. Our calculations explain the\nshapes of the signals observed at all salt concentrations and show that the\nunexpected current decrease and increase are due to the competing effects of\nion concentration polarization and geometric exclusion of ions. Our analysis\nshows that over a wide range of geometry, voltage and salt concentrations we\nare able to understand the ionic current signals of DNA in asymmetric nanopores\nenabling signal optimization in molecular sensing applications.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between the photospheric magnetic field of\nsmall-scale magnetic elements in the quiet Sun (QS) at disc centre, and the\nbrightness at 214 nm, 300 nm, 313 nm, 388 nm, 397 nm, and at 525.02 nm. To this\nend we analysed spectropolarimetric and imaging time series acquired\nsimultaneously by the IMaX magnetograph and the SuFI filter imager on-board the\nballoon-borne observatory Sunrise during its first science flight in 2009, with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution.\n  We find a clear dependence of the contrast in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and\nthe visible on the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field, $B_{\\rm\nLOS}$, which is best described by a logarithmic model. This function represents\nwell the relationship between the Ca II H-line emission and $B_{\\rm LOS}$, and\nworks better than a power-law fit adopted by previous studies. This, along with\nthe high contrast reached at these wavelengths, will help with determining the\ncontribution of small-scale elements in the QS to the irradiance changes for\nwavelengths below 388 nm. At all wavelengths including the continuum at 525.40\nnm the intensity contrast does not decrease with increasing $B_{\\rm LOS}$. This\nresult also strongly supports that Sunrise has resolved small strong magnetic\nfield elements in the internetwork, resulting in constant contrasts for large\nmagnetic fields in our continuum contrast at 525.40 nm vs. $B_{\\rm LOS}$\nscatterplot, unlike the turnover obtained in previous observational studies.\nThis turnover is due to the intermixing of the bright magnetic features with\nthe dark intergranular lanes surrounding them.\n", "  We study the differences and equivalences between the non-perturbative\ndescription of the evolution of cosmic structure furnished by the Szekeres dust\nmodels (a non-spherical exact solution of Einstein's equations) and the\ndynamics of Cosmological Perturbation Theory (CPT) for dust sources in a\n$\\Lambda$CDM background. We show how the dynamics of Szekeres models can be\ndescribed by evolution equations given in terms of \"exact fluctuations\" that\nidentically reduce (at all orders) to evolution equations of CPT in the\ncomoving isochronous gauge. We explicitly show how Szekeres linearised exact\nfluctuations are specific (deterministic) realisations of standard linear\nperturbations of CPT given as random fields but, as opposed to the latter\nperturbations, they can be evolved exactly into the full non-linear regime. We\nprove two important results: (i) the conservation of the curvature perturbation\n(at all scales) also holds for the appropriate approximation of the exact\nSzekeres fluctuations in a $\\Lambda$CDM background, and (ii) the different\ncollapse morphologies of Szekeres models yields, at nonlinear order, different\nfunctional forms for the growth factor that follows from the study of redshift\nspace distortions. The metric based potentials used in linear CPT are computed\nin terms of the parameters of the linearised Szekeres models, thus allowing us\nto relate our results to linear CPT results in other gauges. We believe that\nthese results provide a solid starting stage to examine the role of\nnon-perturbative General Relativity in current cosmological research.\n", "  Hotspots of surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) are localized\nwithin 1 nm at gaps or crevices of plasmonic nanoparticle (NP) dimers. We\ndemonstrate SERRS hotspots with volumes that are extended in one dimension tens\nof thousand times compared to standard zero-dimensional hotspots using gaps or\ncrevices of plasmonic nanowire (NW) dimers.\n", "  Although the complex Langevin method can solve the sign problem in\nsimulations of theories with complex actions, the method will yield the wrong\nresults if known validity conditions are not satisfied. We present a novel\nmethod to compute observables for a target ensemble by reweighting complex\ntrajectories generated with the complex Langevin method for an auxiliary\nensemble having itself a complex action. While it is imperative that the\nvalidity conditions be satisfied for the auxiliary ensemble, there are no such\nrequirements for the target ensemble. This allows us to enlarge the\napplicability range of the complex Langevin method. We illustrate this at the\nhand of a one-dimensional partition function and two-dimensional\nstrong-coupling QCD.\n", "  We examine the effect of the stress tensor of a quantum matter field, such as\nthe electromagnetic field, on the spectrum of primordial gravity waves expected\nin inflationary cosmology. We find that the net effect is a small reduction in\nthe power spectrum, especially at higher frequencies, but which has a different\nform from that described by the usual spectral index. Thus this effect has a\ncharacteristic signature, and is in principle observable. The net effect is a\nsum of two contributions, one of which is due to quantum fluctuations of the\nmatter field stress tensor. The other is a quantum correction to the graviton\nfield due to coupling to the expectation value of this stress tensor. Both\ncontributions are sensitive to initial conditions in the very early universe,\nso this effect has the potential to act as a probe of these initial conditions.\n", "  A plasma beam dump uses the collective oscillations of plasma electrons to\nabsorb the kinetic energy of a particle beam. In this paper, a modified passive\nplasma beam dump scheme is proposed using either a gradient or stepped plasma\nprofile to maintain a higher decelerating gradient compared to a uniform\nplasma. The improvement is a result of the plasma wavelength change preventing\nthe re-acceleration of low energy particles. Particle-in-cell simulation\nresults show that both stepped and gradient plasma profiles can achieve\nimproved energy loss compared to a uniform plasma for an electron bunch of\nparameters routinely achieved in laser wakefield acceleration.\n", "  Full ranges of both hybrid plasmon-mode dispersions and their damping are\nstudied systematically by our recently developed mean-field theory in open\nsystems involving a conducting substrate and a two-dimensional (2D) material\nwith a buckled honeycomb lattice, such as silicene, germanene, and a group\n\\rom{4} dichalcogenide as well. In this hybrid system, the single plasmon mode\nfor a free-standing 2D layer is split into one acoustic-like and one\noptical-like mode, leading to a dramatic change in the damping of plasmon\nmodes. In comparison with gapped graphene, critical features associated with\nplasmon modes and damping in silicene and molybdenum disulfide are found with\nvarious spin-orbit and lattice asymmetry energy bandgaps, doping types and\nlevels, and coupling strengths between 2D materials and the conducting\nsubstrate. The obtained damping dependence on both spin and valley degrees of\nfreedom is expected to facilitate measuring the open-system dielectric property\nand the spin-orbit coupling strength of individual 2D materials. The unique\nlinear dispersion of the acoustic-like plasmon mode introduces additional\ndamping from the intraband particle-hole modes which is absent for a\nfree-standing 2D material layer, and the use of molybdenum disulfide with a\nlarge bandgap simultaneously suppresses the strong damping from the interband\nparticle-hole modes.\n", "  The influence of an external magnetic field on the static shear strain and\nthe effective shear modulus of a magnetoactive elastomer (MAE) is studied\ntheoretically in the framework of a recently introduced approach to the\nsingle-particle magnetostriction mechanism [V. M. Kalita et al, Phys. Rev. E\n93, 062503 (2016)]. The planar problem of magnetostriction in an MAE with soft\nmagnetic inclusions in the form of a thin disk (platelet) having the magnetic\nanisotropy in the plane of this disk is solved analytically. An external\nmagnetic field acts with torques on magnetic filler particles, creates\nmechanical stresses in the vicinity of inclusions, induces shear strain and\nincreases the effective shear modulus of these composite materials. It is shown\nthat the largest effect of the magnetic field on the effective shear modulus\nshould be expected in MAEs with soft elastomer matrices, where the shear\nmodulus of the matrix is less than the magnetic anisotropy constant of\ninclusions. It is derived that the effective shear modulus is non-linearly\ndependent on the external magnetic field and approaches the saturation value in\nmagnetic fields exceeding the field of particle anisotropy. It is shown that\nmodel calculations of the effective shear modulus correspond to a\nphenomenological definition of effective elastic moduli and magnetoelastic\ncoupling constants. Obtained theoretical results compare well with known\nexperimental data. Determination of effective elastic coefficients in MAEs and\ntheir dependence on magnetic field is discussed. The concentration dependence\nof the effective shear modulus at higher filler concentrations has been\nestimated using the method of Pad\\'e approximants, which correctly predicts\nthat both the absolute and relative changes of the magnetic-field dependent\neffective shear modulus will significantly increase with the growing\nconcentration of filler particles.\n", "  Magneto-static models may overcome some of the issues facing force-free\nmagnetic field extrapolations. So far they have seen limited use and have faced\nproblems when applied to quiet-Sun data. Here we present a first application to\nan active region. We use solar vector magnetic field measurements gathered by\nthe IMaX polarimeter during the flight of the \\sunrise{} balloon-borne solar\nobservatory in June 2013 as boundary condition for a magneto-static model of\nthe higher solar atmosphere above an active region. The IMaX data are embedded\nin active region vector magnetograms observed with SDO/HMI. This work continues\nour magneto-static extrapolation approach, which has been applied earlier ({\\it\nPaper I}) to a quiet Sun region observed with \\sunrise{} I. In an active region\nthe signal-to-noise-ratio in the measured Stokes parameters is considerably\nhigher than in the quiet Sun and consequently the IMaX measurements of the\nhorizontal photospheric magnetic field allow us to specify the free parameters\nof the model in a special class of linear magneto-static equilibria. The high\nspatial resolution of IMaX (110-130 km, pixel size 40 km) enables us to model\nthe non-force-free layer between the photosphere and the mid chromosphere\nvertically by about 50 grid points. In our approach we can incorporate some\naspects of the mixed beta layer of photosphere and chromosphere, e.g., taking a\nfinite Lorentz force into account, which was not possible with lower resolution\nphotospheric measurements in the past. The linear model does not, however,\npermit to model intrinsic nonlinear structures like strongly localized electric\ncurrents.\n", "  The SUNRISE balloon-borne solar observatory, consisting of a 1~m aperture\ntelescope that provided a stabilized image to a UV filter imager and an imaging\nvector polarimeter, carried out its second science flight in June 2013. It\nprovided observations of parts of active regions at high spatial resolution,\nincluding the first high-resolution images in the Mg~{\\sc ii}~k line. The\nobtained data are of very high quality, with the best UV images reaching the\ndiffraction limit of the telescope at 3000~\\AA\\ after Multi-Frame Blind\nDeconvolution reconstruction accounting for phase-diversity information. Here a\nbrief update is given of the instruments and the data reduction techniques,\nwhich includes an inversion of the polarimetric data. Mainly those aspects that\nevolved compared with the first flight are described. A tabular overview of the\nobservations is given. In addition, an example time series of a part of the\nemerging active region NOAA AR~11768 observed relatively close to disk centre\nis described and discussed in some detail. The observations cover the pores in\nthe trailing polarity of the active region, as well as the polarity inversion\nline where flux emergence was ongoing and a small flare-like brightening\noccurred in the course of the time series. The pores are found to contain\nmagnetic field strengths ranging up to 2500~G and, while large pores are\nclearly darker and cooler than the quiet Sun in all layers of the photosphere,\nthe temperature and brightness of small pores approach or even exceed those of\nthe quiet Sun in the upper photosphere.\n", "  In this paper we describe an unmanned aerial system equipped with a\nthermal-infrared camera and software pipeline that we have developed to monitor\nanimal populations for conservation purposes. Taking a multi-disciplinary\napproach to tackle this problem, we use freely available astronomical source\ndetection software and the associated expertise of astronomers, to efficiently\nand reliably detect humans and animals in aerial thermal-infrared footage.\nCombining this astronomical detection software with existing machine learning\nalgorithms into a single, automated, end-to-end pipeline, we test the software\nusing aerial video footage taken in a controlled, field-like environment. We\ndemonstrate that the pipeline works reliably and describe how it can be used to\nestimate the completeness of different observational datasets to objects of a\ngiven type as a function of height, observing conditions etc. -- a crucial step\nin converting video footage to scientifically useful information such as the\nspatial distribution and density of different animal species. Finally, having\ndemonstrated the potential utility of the system, we describe the steps we are\ntaking to adapt the system for work in the field, in particular systematic\nmonitoring of endangered species at National Parks around the world.\n", "  Temperature dependent magnetization, muon spin rotation and $^{57}$Fe\nM\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy experiments performed on crystals of intermetallic\nFeGa$_{3-y}$Ge$_{y}$ ($y=0.11,0.14,0.17,0.22,0.27$, $0.29,0.32$) are reported.\nWhereas at $y=0.11$ even a sensitive magnetic microprobe such as $\\mu$SR does\nnot detect magnetism, all other samples display weak ferromagnetism with a\nmagnetic moment of up to 0.22 $\\mu_B$ per Fe atom. As a function of doping and\nof temperature a crossover from short range to long range magnetic order is\nobserved, characterized by a broadly distributed spontaneous internal field.\nHowever, the $y=0.14$ and $y=0.17$ remain in the short range ordered state down\nto the lowest investigated temperature. The transition from short range to long\nrange order appears to be accompanied by a change of the character of the spin\nfluctuations, which exhibit spin wave excitations signature in the LRO part of\nthe phase diagram. M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy for $y=0.27$ and 0.32 indicates\nthat the internal field lies in the plane perpendicular to the crystallographic\n$c$ axis. The field distribution and its evolution with doping suggest that the\ndetails of the Fe magnetic moment formation and the consequent magnetic state\nare determined not only by the dopant concentration but also by the way the\nreplacement of the Ga atoms surrounding the Fe is accomplished.\n", "  High-finesse optical cavity allows the establishment of long-range\ninteractions between bosons in an optical lattice when most cold atoms\nexperiments are restricted to short-range interactions. Supersolid phases have\nrecently been experimentally observed in such systems. Using both exact quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations and Gutzwiller approximation, we study the ground state\nphase diagrams of a two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with infinite-range\ninteractions which describes such experiments. In addition to superfluid and\ninsulating Mott phases, the infinite-range checkerboard interactions introduce\ncharge density waves and supersolid phases. We study here the system at various\nparticle densities, elucidate the nature of the phases and quantum phase\ntransitions, and discuss the stability of the phases with respect to phase\nseparation. In particular we confirm the existence and stability of a\nsupersolid phase detected experimentally.\n", "  Functionals of a stochastic process Y(t) model many physical time-extensive\nobservables, e.g. particle positions, local and occupation times or accumulated\nmechanical work. When Y(t) is a normal diffusive process, their statistics are\nobtained as the solution of the Feynman-Kac equation. This equation provides\nthe crucial link between the expected values of diffusion processes and the\nsolutions of deterministic second-order partial differential equations. When\nY(t) is an anomalous diffusive process, generalizations of the Feynman-Kac\nequation that incorporate power-law or more general waiting time distributions\nof the underlying random walk have recently been derived. A general\nrepresentation of such waiting times is provided in terms of a L\\'evy process\nwhose Laplace exponent is related to the memory kernel appearing in the\ngeneralized Feynman-Kac equation. The corresponding anomalous processes have\nbeen shown to capture nonlinear mean square displacements exhibiting crossovers\nbetween different scaling regimes, which have been observed in biological\nsystems like migrating cells or diffusing macromolecules in intracellular\nenvironments. However, the case where both space- and time-dependent forces\ndrive the dynamics of the generalized anomalous process has not been solved\nyet. Here, we present the missing derivation of the Feynman-Kac equation in\nsuch general case by using the subordination technique. Furthermore, we discuss\nits extension to functionals explicitly depending on time, which are relevant\nfor the stochastic thermodynamics of anomalous diffusive systems. Exact results\non the work fluctuations of a simple non-equilibrium model are obtained. In\nthis paper we also provide a pedagogical introduction to L\\'evy processes,\nsemimartingales and their associated stochastic calculus, which underlie the\nmathematical formulation of anomalous diffusion as a subordinated process.\n", "  Many state of the art methods for the thermodynamic and kinetic\ncharacterization of large and complex biomolecular systems by simulation rely\non ensemble approaches, where data from large numbers of relatively short\ntrajectories are integrated. In this context, Markov state models (MSMs) are\nextremely popular because they can be used to compute stationary quantities and\nlong-time kinetics from ensembles of short simulations, provided that these\nshort simulations are in \"local equilibrium\" within the MSM states. However, in\nthe last over 15 years since the inception of MSMs, it has been controversially\ndiscussed and not yet been answered how deviations from local equilibrium can\nbe detected, whether these deviations induce a practical bias in MSM\nestimation, and how to correct for them. In this paper, we address these\nissues: We systematically analyze the estimation of Markov state models (MSMs)\nfrom short non-equilibrium simulations, and we provide an expression for the\nerror between unbiased transition probabilities and the expected estimate from\nmany short simulations. We show that the unbiased MSM estimate can be obtained\neven from relatively short non-equilibrium simulations in the limit of long lag\ntimes and good discretization. Further, we exploit observable operator model\n(OOM) theory to derive an unbiased estimator for the MSM transition matrix that\ncorrects for the effect of starting out of equilibrium, even when short lag\ntimes are used. Finally, we show how the OOM framework can be used to estimate\nthe exact eigenvalues or relaxation timescales of the system without estimating\nan MSM transition matrix, which allows us to practically assess the\ndiscretization quality of the MSM. Applications to model systems and molecular\ndynamics simulation data of alanine dipeptide are included for illustration.\nThe improved MSM estimator is implemented in PyEMMA as of version 2.3.\n", "  We identify coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with magnetic clouds\n(MCs) observed near Earth by the Wind spacecraft from 2008 to mid-2012, a time\nperiod when the two STEREO spacecraft were well positioned to study\nEarth-directed CMEs. We find 31 out of 48 Wind MCs during this period can be\nclearly connected with a CME that is trackable in STEREO imagery all the way\nfrom the Sun to near 1 AU. For these events, we perform full 3-D\nreconstructions of the CME structure and kinematics, assuming a flux rope\nmorphology for the CME shape, considering the full complement of STEREO and\nSOHO imaging constraints. We find that the flux rope orientations and sizes\ninferred from imaging are not well correlated with MC orientations and sizes\ninferred from the Wind data. However, velocities within the MC region are\nreproduced reasonably well by the image-based reconstruction. Our kinematic\nmeasurements are used to provide simple prescriptions for predicting CME\narrival times at Earth, provided for a range of distances from the Sun where\nCME velocity measurements might be made. Finally, we discuss the differences in\nthe morphology and kinematics of CME flux ropes associated with different\nsurface phenomena (flares, filament eruptions, or no surface activity).\n", "  We discuss the type of the general macroscopic parity-violating effects, when\nthere is the current along the vortex, which is concentrated in the vortex\ncore. We consider vortices in superfluids, which contain the Weyl points. In\nthe vortex core the positions of the Weyl points form the skyrmion structure.\nWe show that the mass current concentrated in such a core is provided by the\nspectral flow through the Weyl points according to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw\nequation for chiral anomaly.\n", "  We consider super-diffusive L\\'evy walks in $d \\geqslant 2$ dimensions when\nthe duration of a single step, i.e., a ballistic motion performed by a walker,\nis governed by a power-law tailed distribution of infinite variance and finite\nmean. We demonstrate that the probability density function (PDF) of the\ncoordinate of the random walker has two different scaling limits at large\ntimes. One limit describes the bulk of the PDF. It is the $d-$dimensional\ngeneralization of the one-dimensional L\\'evy distribution and is the\ncounterpart of central limit theorem (CLT) for random walks with finite\ndispersion. In contrast with the one-dimensional L\\'evy distribution and the\nCLT this distribution does not have universal shape. The PDF reflects\nanisotropy of the single-step statistics however large the time is. The other\nscaling limit, the so-called 'infinite density', describes the tail of the PDF\nwhich determines second (dispersion) and higher moments of the PDF. This limit\nrepeats the angular structure of PDF of velocity in one step. Typical\nrealization of the walk consists of anomalous diffusive motion (described by\nanisotropic $d-$dimensional L\\'evy distribution) intermitted by long ballistic\nflights (described by infinite density). The long flights are rare but due to\nthem the coordinate increases so much that their contribution determines the\ndispersion. We illustrate the concept by considering two types of L\\'evy walks,\nwith isotropic and anisotropic distributions of velocities. Furthermore, we\nshow that for isotropic but otherwise arbitrary velocity distribution the\n$d-$dimensional process can be reduced to one-dimensional L\\'evy walk.\n", "  We argue that the localization of the Repeating FRB at $\\sim 1$ Gpc excludes\nrotationally-powered type of radio emission (e.g., analogues of Crab's giant\npulses coming from very young energetic pulsars) as the origin of FRBs.\n", "  This paper examines the oscillatory behaviour of complex viscoelastic systems\nwith power law-like relaxation behaviour. Specifically, we use the fractional\nMaxwell model, consisting of a spring and fractional dashpot in series, which\nproduces a power-law creep behaviour and a relaxation law following the\nMittag-Leffler function. The fractional dashpot is characterised by a parameter\nbeta, continuously moving from the pure viscous behaviour when beta=1 to the\npurely elastic response when beta=0. In this work, we study the general\nresponse function and focus on the oscillatory behaviour of a fractional\nMaxwell system in four regimes: stress impulse, strain impulse, step stress,\nand driven oscillations. The solutions are presented in a format analogous to\nthe classical oscillator, showing how the fractional nature of relaxation\nchanges the long-time equilibrium behaviour and the short-time transient\nsolutions. We specifically test the critical damping conditions in the\nfractional regime, since these have a particular relevance in biomechanics.\n", "  We consider the classical energy conditions (strong, null and weak) in\nStarobinsky supergravity theories. We study in detail the simplest Starobinsky\nsupergravity model in the \"old-minimal\" supergravity setup and find examples of\nviolations of each energy condition for a certain range of the parameters due\nto extra scalar d.o.f. present in supergravity. We find the null and weak\nenergy conditions to be preserved and the strong energy condition to be\nviolated in the physically relevant examples such as inflation and dark energy.\n", "  Computing polarised intensities from noisy data in Stokes U and Q suffers\nfrom a positive bias that should be suppressed. To develop a correction method\nthat, when applied to maps, should provide a distribution of polarised\nintensity that closely follows the signal from the source. We propose a new\nmethod to suppress the bias by estimating the polarisation angle of the source\nsignal in a noisy environment with help of a modified median filter. We then\ndetermine the polarised intensity, including the noise, by projection of the\nobserved values of Stokes U and Q onto the direction of this polarisation\nangle. We show that our new method represents the true signal very well. If the\nnoise distribution in the maps of U and Q is Gaussian, then in the corrected\nmap of polarised intensity it is also Gaussian. Smoothing to larger Gaussian\nbeamsizes, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, can be done directly with our\nmethod in the map of the polarised intensity. Our method also works in case of\nnon-Gaussian noise distributions. The maps of the corrected polarised\nintensities and polarisation angles are reliable even in regions with weak\nsignals and provide integrated flux densities and degrees of polarisation\nwithout the cumulative effect of the bias, which especially affects faint\nsources. Features at low intensity levels like 'depolarisation canals' are\nsmoother than in the maps using the previous methods, which has broader\nimplications, for example on the interpretation of interstellar turbulence.\n", "  Stellar core collapse events are expected to produce gravitational waves via\nseveral mechanisms, most of which are not yet fully understood due to the\ncurrent limitations in the numerical simulations of these events. In this\npaper, we begin with an empirical functional form that fits the\ngravitational-wave spectra from existing simulations of stellar core collapse\nand integrate over all collapse events in the universe to estimate the\nresulting stochastic gravitational-wave background. We then use a Gaussian\nfunctional form to separately fit and model a low-frequency peak in the\ncore-collapse strain spectra, which likely occurs due to prompt convection. We\nsystematically study the parameter space of both models, as well as the\ncombined case, and investigate their detectability by upcoming\ngravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope.\nAssuming realistic formation rates for progenitors of core-collapse supernovae,\nour results indicate that both models are 2--4 orders of magnitude below the\nexpected sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, and 1--2 orders of magnitude below that\nof the Einstein Telescope.\n", "  This paper investigates the Fano-Feshbach resonance with a two-channel\ncoupled-square-well model in both the frequency and time domains. This systems\nis shown to exhibit Fano lineshape profiles in the energy absorption spectrum.\nThe associated time-dependent dipole response has a phase shift that has\nrecently been understood to be related to the Fano lineshape asymmetric $q$\nparameter by $\\phi=2arg(q-i)$. The present study demonstrates that the\nphase-$q$ correspondence is general for any Fano resonance in the weak coupling\nregime, independent of the transition mechanism.\n", "  We extend our analysis of quasi-distributions onto the pion distribution\namplitude. Using the formalism of parton virtuality distribution amplitudes\n(VDAs), we establish a connection between the pion transverse momentum\ndependent distribution amplitude (TMDA) $\\Psi (x, k_\\perp^2)$ and the pion\nquasi-distribution amplitude (QDA) $Q_\\pi (y,p_3)$. We build models for the\nQDAs from the VDA-based models for soft TMDAs, and analyze the $p_3$ dependence\nof the resulting QDAs. As there are many models claimed to describe the\nprimordial shape of the pion DA, we present the $p_3$-evolution patterns for\nmodels producing some popular proposals: Chernyak-Zhitnitsky, flat and\nasymptotic DAs. Our results may be used as a guide for future studies of the\npion distribution amplitude on the lattice using the quasi-distribution\napproach.\n", "  This article reviews the status of current research on the 112-phase of\npnictides. The 112-phase has gained augmented attention due to the recent\ndiscovery of high-temperature superconductivity in $\\cl$ with a maximum\ncritical temperature $\\tc\\sim$ 47\\,K upon Sb substitution. The structural,\nmagnetic, and electronic properties of $\\cl$ bear some similarities with other\nsuperconducting pnictide phases, however, the different valence states of the\npnictogen and the presence of a metallic spacer layer are unique features of\nthe 112-system. Low-temperature superconductivity which coexists with\nantiferromagnetic order was observed in transition metal (Ni, Pd) deficient\n112-compounds like $\\cn$, $\\lpb$, $\\lps$, $\\lns$. Besides superconductivity,\nthe presence of naturally occurring anisotropic Dirac Fermionic states were\nobserved in the layered 112-compounds $\\smb$, $\\cmb$, $\\lab$ which are of\nsignificant interest for future nanoelectronics as an alternative to graphene.\nIn these compounds, the linear energy dispersion resulted in a high\nmagnetoresistance that stayed unsaturated even at the highest applied magnetic\nfields. Here, we describe various 112-type materials systems combining\nexperimental results and theoretical predictions to stimulate further research\non this less well-known member of the pnictide family.\n", "  Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by axisymmetric rotating collapse,\nbounce, and early postbounce phases of a galactic core-collapse supernova will\nbe detectable by current-generation gravitational wave observatories. Since\nthese GWs are emitted from the quadrupole-deformed nuclear-density core, they\nmay encode information on the uncertain nuclear equation of state (EOS). We\nexamine the effects of the nuclear EOS on GWs from rotating core collapse and\ncarry out 1824 axisymmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations that\ncover a parameter space of 98 different rotation profiles and 18 different EOS.\nWe show that the bounce GW signal is largely independent of the EOS and\nsensitive primarily to the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy, and at\nhigh rotation rates, to the degree of differential rotation. The GW frequency\nof postbounce core oscillations shows stronger EOS dependence that can be\nparameterized by the core's EOS-dependent dynamical frequency\n$\\sqrt{G\\bar{\\rho}_c}$. We find that the ratio of the peak frequency to the\ndynamical frequency follows a universal trend that is obeyed by all EOS and\nrotation profiles and that indicates that the nature of the core oscillations\nchanges when the rotation rate exceeds the dynamical frequency. We find that\ndifferences in the treatments of low-density nonuniform nuclear matter, of the\ntransition from nonuniform to uniform nuclear matter, and in the description of\nnuclear matter up to around twice saturation density can mildly affect the GW\nsignal. We find that approximations and uncertainties in electron capture rates\ncan lead to variations in the GW signal that are of comparable magnitude to\nthose due to different nuclear EOS. This emphasizes the need for reliable\nnuclear electron capture rates and for self-consistent multi-dimensional\nneutrino radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of rotating core collapse.\n", "  Crack-tip stress evaluation has always been a problem in the frame of\nclassical elasticity theory. Peridynamics has been shown to have great\nadvantages in dealing with crack problems. In the present study, we present a\nperidynamic crack-tip stress evaluation method for multi-scale Griffith crack\nsubject to tensile loading. The bond-based peridynamics is used to calculate\nthe displacement field. Non-local deformation gradient definition from\nnon-ordinary state-based peridynamics is used for stress calculation. Besides,\na scale factor is introduced for evaluating crack-tip stress of multi-scale\nGriffith crack. Numerical results compared with Eringen's results show that\nthis peridynamic crack-tip stress evaluation method is valid for multi-scale\ncracks, and with the change of distance of material points, the evaluated\ncrack-tip stress tends to be stable.\n", "  We report the detection of oscillations in slender Ca II H fibrils (SCFs)\nfrom high-resolution observations acquired with the Sunrise balloon-borne solar\nobservatory. The SCFs show obvious oscillations in their intensity, but also\ntheir width. The oscillatory behaviors are investigated at several positions\nalong the axes of the SCFs. A large majority of fibrils show signs of\noscillations in intensity. Their periods and phase speeds are analyzed using a\nwavelet analysis. The width and intensity perturbations have overlapping\ndistributions of the wave period.\n  The obtained distributions have median values of the period of $32\\pm17$s and\n$36\\pm25$s, respectively. We find that the fluctuations of both parameters\npropagate in the SCFs with speeds of ${11}^{+49}_{-11}$ km/s and\n${15}^{+34}_{-15}$ km/s, respectively. Furthermore, the width and intensity\noscillations have a strong tendency to be either in anti-phase, or, to a\nsmaller extent, in phase. This suggests that the oscillations of both\nparameters are caused by the same wave mode and that the waves are likely\npropagating. Taking all the evidence together, the most likely wave mode to\nexplain all measurements and criteria is the fast sausage mode.\n", "  The upcoming Fermilab E989 experiment will measure the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment $a_{\\mu}$ . This measurement is motivated by the previous\nmeasurement performed in 2001 by the BNL E821 experiment that reported a 3-4\nstandard deviation discrepancy between the measured value and the Standard\nModel prediction. The new measurement at Fermilab aims to improve the precision\nby a factor of four reducing the total uncertainty from 540 parts per billion\n(BNL E821) to 140 parts per billion (Fermilab E989). This paper gives the\nstatus of the experiment.\n", "  It is shown by particle-in-cell simulation that intense circularly polarized\n(CP) laser light can be contained in the cavity of a solid-density circular\nAl-plasma shell for hundreds of light-wave periods before it is dissipated by\nlaser-plasma interaction. A right-hand CP laser pulse can propagate almost\nwithout reflection into the cavity through a highly magnetized overdense\nH-plasma slab filling the entrance hole. The entrapped laser light is then\nmultiply reflected at the inner surfaces of the slab and shell plasmas,\ngradually losing energy to the latter. Compared to that of the incident laser,\nthe frequency is only slightly broadened and the wave vector slightly modified\nby appearance of weak nearly isotropic and homogeneous higher harmonics.\n", "  Starting from a statistical model of the electron, which explains spin and\nspin measurements in terms of a probability density distribution resulting from\na rapidly changing angular momentum during an extended Zitterbewegung, a\nlight-like model of electron and Fermions is formulated. This model describes\nindividual particles in terms of paths of a moving quantum. It is shown that\nthis description allows one to reproduce observable properties as path-averages\nover a period of the fast extended Zitterbewegung in elementary calculations.\nThe general topology of the paths may be described as a helical path, with a\nhelix axis forming a circle around a fixed point in space. The radius of the\nhelix and of the circle are equal and given by half the reduced Compton wave\nlength of a photon of energy equal to the rest energy of the particle\ndescribed. The paths depend on the relative velocity between the described\nentity and the observer, and represent the De Broglie wave. The merits of the\nproposed model are summarized and its role in relation to the established\ndescription by quantum mechanics discussed. It is concluded that it supports\nthe existence of the proposed extended Zitterbewegung, and offers a description\nof quantum behaviour without quantum mechanics.\n", "  Hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to\nstudy the microstructures of nanocrystalline (nc) Cu/Ag alloys with various Ag\nconcentrations. When the Ag concentration is below 50 Ag atoms/nm!, an increase\nin Ag concentration leads to a gradual growth of monolayer grain boundary (GB)\ncomplexions into nanolayer complexions. Above the concentration of 50 Ag\natoms/nm!, wetting layers with a bulk crystalline phase are observed. The\neffects of Ag on mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of nc Cu/Ag\nalloys are investigated in MD simulations of uniaxial tension. GB sliding\nresistance is found to first increase and then decrease with an increase in Ag\nconcentration. Surprisingly, we also find that the dislocation density\ndecreases monotonically with an increase in Ag concentration, which suggests\nthat the grain interiors are softened by the introduction of Ag dopants at GBs.\nIn addition, there is a critical Ag concentration that maximizes flow stress of\nnc Cu/Ag alloys. The flow stress, GB sliding resistance, and the intragranular\ndislocation densities become less sensitive to Ag dopants when the grain\ndiameter increases from 5nm to 40nm.\n", "  Two phase titanium alloys are important for high performance engineering\ncomponents, such as aeroengine discs. The microstructures of these alloys are\ntailored during thermomechanical processing to precisely control phase\nfactions, morphology and crystallographic orientations. In bimodal two phase\n({\\alpha} + {\\beta}) Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-2Mo (Ti-6242) alloys there are often three\nmicrostructural lengthscales to consider: large (~10 {\\mu}m) equiaxed primary\n{\\alpha}; >200 nm thick plate {\\alpha} with a basketweave morphology; and very\nfine scaled (>50 nm plate thickness) secondary {\\alpha} that grows between the\nlarger {\\alpha} plates surrounded by retained {\\beta}. In this work, we utilise\nhigh spatial resolution transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD, also known as\ntransmission based electron backscatter diffraction, t-EBSD) and scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM) based forward scattering electron imaging to resolve\nthe structures and orientations of basketweave and secondary {\\alpha} in\nTi-6242. We analyse the {\\alpha} variants formed within one prior {\\beta}\ngrain, and test whether existing theories of habit planes of the phase\ntransformation are upheld. Our analysis is important in understanding both the\nthermomechanical processing strategy of new bimodal two-phase titanium alloys,\nas well the ultimate performance of these alloys in complex loading regimes\nsuch as dwell fatigue. Our paper champions the significant increase in spatial\nresolution afforded using transmission techniques, combined with the ease of\nSEM based analysis using conventional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)\nsystems and forescatter detector (FSD) imaging, to study the nanostructure of\nreal-world engineering alloys.\n", "  We study three-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on\n$\\mathcal{M}_{g,p}$, an oriented circle bundle of degree $p$ over a closed\nRiemann surface, $\\Sigma_g$. We compute the $\\mathcal{M}_{g,p}$ supersymmetric\npartition function and correlation functions of supersymmetric loop operators.\nThis uncovers interesting relations between observables on manifolds of\ndifferent topologies. In particular, the familiar supersymmetric partition\nfunction on the round $S^3$ can be understood as the expectation value of a\nso-called \"fibering operator\" on $S^2 \\times S^1$ with a topological twist.\nMore generally, we show that the 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric partition\nfunctions (and supersymmetric Wilson loop correlation functions) on\n$\\mathcal{M}_{g,p}$ are fully determined by the two-dimensional A-twisted\ntopological field theory obtained by compactifying the 3d theory on a circle.\nWe give two complementary derivations of the result. We also discuss\napplications to F-maximization and to three-dimensional supersymmetric\ndualities.\n", "  We report an experimental observation of multiple co--rotating vortices in a\nextended dust column in the background of non--uniform diffused plasma.\nInductively coupled RF discharge is initiated in the background of argon gas in\nthe source region which later found to diffuse in the main experimental\nchamber. A secondary DC glow discharge plasma is produced to introduce the dust\nparticles into the plasma. These micron sized poly-disperse dust particles get\ncharged in the plasma environment and transported by the ambipolar electric\nfield of the diffused plasma and found to confine in the potential well, where\nthe resultant electric field of the diffused plasma (ambipolar E--field) and\nglass wall charging (sheath E--field) hold the micron sized particles against\nthe gravity. Multiple co--rotating (anti--clockwise) dust vortices are observed\nin the dust cloud for a particular discharge condition. The transition from\nmultiple to single dust vortex is observed when input RF power is lowered.\nOccurrence of these vortices are explained on the basis of the charge gradient\nof dust particles which is orthogonal to the ion drag force. The charge\ngradient is a consequence of the plasma inhomogeneity along the dust cloud\nlength. The detailed nature and the reason for multiple vortices are still\nunder investigation through further experiments, however, preliminary\nqualitative understanding is discussed based on characteristic scale length of\ndust vortex. There is a characteristic size of the vortex in the dusty plasma\nso that multiple vortices is possible to form in the extended dusty plasma with\ninhomogeneous plasma background. The experimental results on the vortex motion\nof particles are compared with a theoretical model and found some agreement.\n", "  Starting from a microscopic model of self-propelled hard spheres we use tools\nof non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of hard spheres\nto derive a Smoluchowski equation for interacting Active Brownian particles. We\nillustrate the utility of the statistical mechanics framework developed with\ntwo applications. First, we derive the steady state pressure of the hard sphere\nactive fluid in terms of the microscopic parameters and second, we identify the\ncritical density for the onset of motility-induced phase separation in this\nsystem. We show that both these quantities agree well with overdamped\nsimulations of active Brownian particles with excluded volume interactions\ngiven by steeply repulsive potentials. The results presented here can be used\nto incorporate excluded volume effects in diverse models of self-propelled\nparticles.\n", "  In this work we report the synthesis and structural, electronic and magnetic\nproperties of La1.5Ca0.5CoMnO6 double-perovskite. This is a re-entrant spin\ncluster material which exhibits a non-negligible negative exchange bias effect\nwhen it is cooled in zero magnetic field from an unmagnetized state down to low\ntemperature. X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and\nmagnetometry results indicate mixed valence state at Co site, leading to\ncompeting magnetic phases and uncompensated spins at the magnetic interfaces.\nWe compare the results for this Ca-doped material with those reported for the\nresemblant compound La1.5Sr0.5CoMnO6, and discuss the much smaller spontaneous\nexchange bias effect observed for the former in terms of its structural and\nmagnetic particularities. For La1.5Ca0.5CoMnO6, when successive magnetization\nloops are carried, the spontaneous exchange bias field inverts its sign from\nnegative to positive from the first to the second measurement. We discuss this\nbehavior based on the disorder at the magnetic interfaces, related to the\npresence of a glassy phase. This compound also exhibits a large conventional\nexchange bias, for which there is no sign inversion of the exchange bias field\nfor consecutive cycles.\n", "  In this work we will test an alternative model of gravity belonging to the\nlarge family of galileon models. It is characterized by an intrinsic breaking\nof the Vainshtein mechanism inside large astrophysical objects, thus having\npossibly detectable observational signatures. We will compare theoretical\npredictions from this model with the observed total mass profile for a sample\nof clusters of galaxies. The profiles are derived using two complementary\ntools: X-ray hot intra-cluster gas dynamics, and strong and weak gravitational\nlensing. We find that a dependence with the dynamical internal status of each\ncluster is possible; for those clusters which are very close to be relaxed, and\nthus less perturbed by possible astrophysical local processes, the galileon\nmodel gives a quite good fit to both X-ray and lensing observations. Both\nmasses and concentrations for the dark matter halos are consistent with earlier\nresults found in numerical simulations and in the literature, and no compelling\nstatistical evidence for a deviation from general relativity is detectable from\nthe present observational state. Actually, the characteristic galileon\nparameter $\\Upsilon$ is always consistent with zero, and only an upper limit\n($\\lesssim0.086$ at $1\\sigma$, $\\lesssim0.16$ at $2\\sigma$, and $\\lesssim0.23$\nat $3\\sigma$) can be established. Some interesting distinctive deviations might\nbe operative, but the statistical validity of the results is far from strong,\nand better data would be needed in order to either confirm or reject a\npotential tension with general relativity.\n", "  We examine the marginal deformations of double-trace type in 3d\nsupersymmetric U(N) model with N complex free bosons and fermions. We compute\nthe anomalous dimensions of higher spin currents to the 1/N order but to all\norders in the deformation parameters by mainly applying the conformal\nperturbation theory. The 3d field theory is supposed to be dual to 4d\nsupersymmetric Vasiliev theory, and the marginal deformations are argued to\ncorrespond to modifying boundary conditions for bulk scalars and fermions. Thus\nthe modification should break higher spin gauge symmetry and generate the\nmasses of higher spin fields. We provide supports for the dual interpretation\nby relating bulk computation in terms of Witten diagrams to boundary one in\nconformal perturbation theory.\n", "  The nature of the velocity distribution of a driven granular gas, though well\nstudied, is unknown as to whether it is universal or not, and if universal what\nit is. We determine the tails of the steady state velocity distribution of a\ndriven inelastic Maxwell gas, which is a simple model of a granular gas where\nthe rate of collision between particles is independent of the separation as\nwell as the relative velocity. We show that the steady state velocity\ndistribution is non-universal and depends strongly on the nature of driving.\nThe asymptotic behavior of the velocity distribution are shown to be identical\nto that of a non-interacting model where the collisions between particles are\nignored. For diffusive driving, where collisions with the wall are modelled by\nan additive noise, the tails of the velocity distribution is universal only if\nthe noise distribution decays faster than exponential.\n", "  The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL.EU) will provide every 0.1 s a\ntrain of 2700 spatially coherent ultrashort X-ray pulses at 4.5 MHz repetition\nrate. The Small Quantum Systems (SQS) instrument and the Spectroscopy and\nCoherent Scattering instrument (SCS) operate with soft X-rays between 0.5 keV -\n6keV. The DEPFET Sensor with Signal Compression (DSSC) detector is being\ndeveloped to meet the requirements set by these two XFEL.EU instruments. The\nDSSC imager is a 1 mega-pixel camera able to store up to 800 single-pulse\nimages per train. The so-called ladder is the basic unit of the DSSC detector.\nIt is the single unit out of sixteen identical-units composing the\nDSSC-megapixel camera, containing all representative electronic components of\nthe full-size system and allows testing the full electronic chain. Each DSSC\nladder has a focal plane sensor with 128 x 512 pixels. The read-out ASIC\nprovides full-parallel readout of the sensor pixels. Every read-out channel\ncontains an amplifier and an analog filter, an up-to 9 bit ADC and the digital\nmemory. The ASIC amplifier have a double front-end to allow one to use either\nDEPFET sensors or Mini-SDD sensors. In the first case, the signal compression\nis a characteristic intrinsic of the sensor; in the second case, the\ncompression is implemented at the first amplification stage. The goal of signal\ncompression is to meet the requirement of single-photon detection capability\nand wide dynamic range. We present the first results of measurements obtained\nusing a 64 x 64 pixel DEPFET sensor attached to the full final electronic and\ndata-acquisition chain.\n", "  Ground-based Imaging Cherenkov Telescope Arrays observe the Cherenkov\nradiation emitted in extended atmospheric showers generated by cosmic gamma\nrays in the TeV regime. The rate of these events is normally overwhelmed by 2-3\norders of magnitude more abundant cosmic rays induced showers. A large fraction\nof these 'background' events is vetoed at the online trigger level, but a\nsubstantial fraction still goes through data acquisition system and is saved\nfor the offline reconstruction. What kind of information those events carry,\nnormally rejected in the analysis? Is there the possibility that an exotic\nsignature is hidden in those data? In the contribution, some science cases, and\nthe problems related to the event reconstruction for the current and future\ngeneration of these telescopes will be discussed.\n", "  A recently proposed technique correlating electric fields and particle\nvelocity distributions is applied to single-point time series extracted from\nlinearly unstable, electrostatic numerical simulations. The form of the\ncorrelation, which measures the transfer of phase-space energy density between\nthe electric field and plasma distributions and had previously been applied to\ndamped electrostatic systems, is modified to include the effects of drifting\nequilibrium distributions of the type that drive counter-streaming and\nbump-on-tail instabilities. By using single-point time series, the correlation\nis ideal for diagnosing dynamics in systems where access to integrated\nquantities, such as energy, is observationally infeasible. The velocity-space\nstructure of the field-particle correlation is shown to characterize the\nunderlying physical mechanisms driving unstable systems. The use of this\ncorrelation in simple systems will assist in its eventual application to\nturbulent, magnetized plasmas, with the ultimate goal of characterizing the\nnature of mechanisms that damp turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.\n", "  A picosecond acoustic pulse can be used to control the lasing emission from\nsemiconductor nanostructures by shifting their electronic transitions. When the\nactive medium, here an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots, is shifted into or\nout of resonance with the cavity mode, a large enhancement or suppression of\nthe lasing emission can dynamically be achieved. Most interesting, even in the\ncase when gain medium and cavity mode are in resonance, we observe an\nenhancement of the lasing due to shaking by coherent phonons. In order to\nunderstand the interactions of the non-linearly coupled photon-exciton-phonon\nsubsystems, we develop a semiclassical model and find an excellent agreement\nbetween theory and experiment.\n", "  This work examines superradiance in initially inverted clouds of\n\\textit{multi-level} atoms. We develop a set of equations that can\napproximately calculate the temporal evolution of $N$ coupled atoms. This\nallows us to simulate clouds containing hundreds of multi-level atoms while\neschewing the assumption and/or approximation of symmetric dipole-dipole\ninteractions. This treatment is used to explore the effects that dephasing\ncaused by elastic dipole-dipole interactions, and competition between multiple\ntransitions have on superradiance. Both of these mechanisms place strong\nparametrical restrictions on a given transition's ability to superradiate.\nThese results are likely important to recent experiments that probe\nsuperradiance in Rydberg atoms.\n", "  GeSn alloys are the subject of intense research activities as these group IV\nsemiconductors present direct bandgap behaviors for high Sn contents. Today,\nthe control of strain becomes an important challenge to improve GeSn devices.\nStrain micro-measurements are usually performed by Raman spectroscopy. However,\ndifferent relationships linking the Raman spectral shifts to the built-in\nstrain can be found in the literature. They were deduced from studies on low Sn\ncontent GeSn layers (i.e. xSn<8%) or on GeSiSn layers. In this work, we have\ncalibrated the GeSn Raman relationship for really high Sn content GeSn binaries\n(6<xSn<15%). We have used fully strained GeSn layers and fully relaxed GeSn\nunder-etched microstructures to clearly differentiate the contributions of\nstrain and chemical composition on the Ge-Ge Raman spectral shift. We have\nshown that the GeSn Raman-strain coefficient for high Sn contents is higher\ncompared to that for pure Ge.\n", "  Raman scattering is a ubiquitous phenomenon in light-matter interactions\nwhich reveals a material's electronic, structural and thermal properties.\nControlling this process would enable new ways of studying and manipulating\nfundamental material properties. Here, we report a novel Raman scattering\nprocess at the interface between different van der Waals (vdW) materials as\nwell as between a monolayer semiconductor and 3D crystalline substrates. We\nfind that interfacing a WSe2 monolayer with materials such as SiO2, sapphire,\nand hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enables Raman transitions with phonons which\nare either traditionally inactive or weak. This Raman scattering can be\namplified by nearly two orders of magnitude when a foreign phonon mode is\nresonantly coupled to the A exciton in WSe2 directly, or via an A'1 optical\nphonon from WSe2. We further showed that the interfacial Raman scattering is\ndistinct between hBN-encapsulated and hBN-sandwiched WSe2 sample geometries.\nThis cross-platform electron-phonon coupling, as well as the sensitivity of 2D\nexcitons to their phononic environments, will prove important in the\nunderstanding and engineering of optoelectronic devices based on vdW\nheterostructures.\n", "  Epidemic spreading on complex networks depends on the topological structure\nas well as on the dynamical properties of the infection itself. Generally\nspeaking, highly connected individuals play the role of hubs and are crucial to\nchannel information across the network. On the other hand, static topological\nquantities measuring the connectivity structure are independent on the\ndynamical mechanisms of the infection. A natural question is therefore how to\nimprove the topological analysis by some kind of dynamical information that may\nbe extracted from the ongoing infection itself. In this spirit, we propose a\nnovel vaccination scheme that exploits information from the details of the\ninfection pattern at the moment when the vaccination strategy is applied.\nNumerical simulations of the infection process show that the proposed\nimmunization strategy is effective and robust on a wide class of complex\nnetworks.\n", "  We argue that the modification proposed by Li et al. [Chin. Phys. Lett. 32,\n050303 (2015)] to the experiment of Danan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 240402\n(2013)] does not test the past of the photon as characterised by local weak\ntraces. Instead of answering the questions: (i) Were the photons in A? (ii)\nWere the photons in B? (iii) Were the photons in C? the proposed experiment\nmeasures a degenerate operator answering the questions: (i) Were the photons in\nA? (ii) Were the photons in B and C together? A negative answer to the last\nquestion does not tell us if photons were present in B or C. A simple variation\nof the modified experiment does provide good evidence for the past of the\nphoton in agreement with the results Danan et al. obtained.\n", "  We observed the field of the Fermi source 3FGL J0838.8-2829 in optical and\nX-rays, initially motivated by the cataclysmic variable (CV) 1RXS\nJ083842.1-282723 that lies within its error circle. Several X-ray sources first\nclassified as CVs have turned out to be gamma-ray emitting millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs). We find that 1RXS J083842.1-282723 is in fact an unusual CV, a\nstream-fed asynchronous polar in which accretion switches between magnetic\npoles (that are $\\approx$120$^{\\circ}$ apart) when the accretion rate is at\nminimum. High-amplitude X-ray modulation at periods of 94.8$\\pm$0.4 minutes and\n14.7$\\pm$1.2 hr are seen. The former appears to be the spin period, while\nlatter is inferred to be one-third of the beat period between the spin and the\norbit, implying an orbital period of 98.3$\\pm$0.5 minutes. We also measure an\noptical emission-line spectroscopic period of 98.413$\\pm$0.004 minutes which is\nconsistent with the orbital period inferred from the X-rays. In any case, this\nsystem is unlikely to be the gamma-ray source. Instead, we find a fainter\nvariable X-ray and optical source, XMMU J083850.38-282756.8, that is modulated\non a time scale of hours in addition to exhibiting occasional sharp flares. It\nresembles the black widow or redback pulsars that have been discovered as\ncounterparts of Fermi sources, with the optical modulation due to heating of\nthe photosphere of a low-mass companion star by, in this case, an as-yet\nundetected MSP. We propose XMMU J083850.38-282756.8 as the MSP counterpart of\n3FGL J0838.8-2829.\n", "  In this talk, we motivate the calculation of the matrix elements of novel CP\nviolating operators, the quark EDM and the quark chromo EDM operators, within\nthe nucleon state using lattice QCD. These matrix elements, combined with the\nbound on the neutron EDM, would provide stringent constraints on beyond the\nstandard model physics, especially as the next generation of neutron EDM\nexperiments reduce the current bound. We then present our lattice strategy for\nthe calculation of these matrix elements, in particular we describe the use of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger source method to reduce the calculation of the 4-point to\n3-point functions needed to evaluate the quark chromo EDM contribution. We end\nwith a status report on the quality of the signal obtained in the lattice\ncalculations of the connected contributions to the quark chromo EDM operator\nand the pseudoscalar operator it mixes with under renormalization.\n"]}
