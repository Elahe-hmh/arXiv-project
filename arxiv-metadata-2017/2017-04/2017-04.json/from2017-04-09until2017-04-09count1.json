The\nlatter field is a combination of two exponential parts, one exponentially\nincreasing and another exponentially decreasing. We find exact solutions of the\nDirac equation with the field under consideration with appropriate asymptotic\nconditions and calculate all the characteristics of particle creation effect,\nin particular, differential mean numbers of created particle, total number of\ncreated particles, and the probability for a vacuum to remain a vacuum.\nCharacteristic asymptotic regimes are discussed in detail and a comparison with\nthe pure asymptotically decaying field is considered.\n"]}
