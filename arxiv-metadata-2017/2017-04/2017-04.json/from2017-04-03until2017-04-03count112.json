The intensity and line shapes of the two families of Bragg\npeaks characterising both the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic\ncomponents of the magnetic order present in this material have been measured as\na function of temperature and applied magnetic fields of up to 5 T. We have\nstudied the microscopic nature of the magnetic order at each step seen in the\nbulk magnetisation and investigated the evolution of the long and short-range\ncomponents of the magnetic order in Ca3Co2O6.\n", "  We study characteristics of quantum evolution which can be called curvature\nand torsion. The curvature shows a deviation of the state vector in quantum\nevolution from the geodesic line. The torsion shows a deviation of state vector\nfrom the plane of evolution (a two-dimensional subspace) at a given time.\n", "  Banhatti (2009) set down the procedure to derive cosmological number density\nn(z) from the differential distribution p(x) of the fractional luminosity\nvolume relative to the maximum volume, x \\equiv V/Vm (0 \\leq x \\leq 1), using a\nsmall sample of 76 quasars for illustrative purposes. This procedure is here\napplied to a bigger sample of 286 quasars selected from Parkes half-Jansky\nflat-spectrum survey at 2.7 GHz (Drinkwater et al 1997). The values of n(z) are\nobtained for 8 values of redshift z from 0 to 3.5. The function n(z) can be\ninterpreted in terms of redshift distribution obtained by integrating the radio\nluminosity function {\\rho}(P, z) over luminosities P for the survey limiting\nflux density S0 = 0.5 Jy. Keywords. V/Vm - luminosity-volume - cosmological\nnumber density - redshift distribution - luminosity function - quasars [Note:\nThis somewhat modified version was submitted to MNRaS on 14 July 2016. It was\n(almost) rejected, except if thoroughly revised.]\n", "  We study cosmological models derived from higher-order Gauss-Bonnet gravity\n$F(R,G)$ by using the Lagrange multiplier approach without assuming the\npresence of additional fields with the exception of standard perfect fluid\nmatter. The presence of Lagrange multipliers reduces the number of allowed\nsolutions. We need to introduce compatibility conditions of the FRW equations,\nwhich impose strict restrictions on the metric or require the introduction of\nadditional exotic matter. Several classes of $F(R,G)$ models are generated and\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the local\nmagnetism of the Co ions in the spin-chain compound CoV2O6, which crystallizes\nin two different allotropic phases, alpha- and gamma-CoV2O6. Using x-ray\nmagnetic circular dichroism, we have found a very large and a moderate orbital\ncontribution to the magnetism in alpha- and gamma-CoV2O6, respectively.\nFull-multiplet calculations indicate that the differences in the magnetic\nbehavior of alpha- and gamma-CoV2O6 phases originate from different local\ndistortions of the CoO6 octahedra. In particular, the strong compression of the\nCoO6 octahedra in alpha-CoV2O6 lead to a strong mixture of t2g and eg orbitals\nwhich, via the local atomic Coulomb and exchange interactions, results in an\nexceptionally large orbital moment.\n", "  Combining the characteristic method and the local discontinuous Galerkin\nmethod with carefully constructing numerical fluxes, we design the variational\nformulations for the time-dependent convection-dominated Navier-Stokes\nequations in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The proposed symmetric variational formulation is\nstrictly proved to be unconditionally stable; and the scheme has the striking\nbenefit that the conditional number of the matrix of the corresponding matrix\nequation does not increase with the refining of the meshes. The presented\nscheme works well for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, e.g., the scheme still\nhas good error convergence when $Re=0.5 e+005$ or $1.0 e+ 008$. Extensive\nnumerical experiments are performed to show the optimal convergence orders and\nthe contours of the solutions of the equation with given initial and boundary\nconditions.\n", "  We study first order deformations of the tangent sheaf of resolutions of\nCalabi-Yau threefolds that are of the form $\\mathbb{C}^3/Z_r$, focusing on the\ncases where the orbifold has an isolated singularity. We prove a lower bound on\nthe number of deformations for any crepant resolution of this orbifold. We show\nthat this lower bound is achieved when the resolution used is the G-Hilbert\nscheme, and note that this lower bound can be found using methods from string\ntheory. These methods lead us to a new way to construct the G-Hilbert scheme\nusing the singlet count.\n", "  We study a class of scalar, linear, non-local Riemann-Hilbert problems (RHP)\ninvolving finite subgroups of PSL(2,C). We associate to such problems a (maybe\ninfinite) root system and describe the relevance of the orbits of the Weyl\ngroup in the construction of its solutions. As an application, we study in\ndetail the large N expansion of SU(N) or SO(N) or Sp(2N) Chern-Simons partition\nfunction Z_N(M) of 3-manifolds M that are either rational homology spheres or\nmore generally Seifert fibered spaces. It has a matrix model-like\nrepresentation, whose spectral curve can be characterized in terms of a RHP as\nabove. When pi_1(M) is finite (i.e. for manifolds M that are quotients of\n\\mathbb{S}_{3} by a finite isometry group of type ADE), the Weyl group\nassociated to the RHP is finite and the spectral curve is algebraic and can be\nin principle computed. We then show that the large $N$ expansion of Z_N(M) is\ncomputed by the topological recursion. This has consequences for the\nanalyticity properties of SU/SO/Sp perturbative invariants of knots along\nfibers in $M$.\n", "  We derive a full formula for the energy level of a heavy quarkonium state\nidentified by the quantum numbers $n$, $\\ell$, $s$ and $j$, up to ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s^5 m)$ and ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^5 m \\log \\alpha_s)$ in perturbative\nQCD. The QCD Bethe logarithm is given in a one-parameter integral form. The\nrest of the formula is given as a combination of rational numbers,\ntranscendental numbers ($\\pi$, $\\zeta(3)$, $\\zeta(5)$) and finite sums (besides\nthe 3-loop constant $\\bar{a}_3$ of the static potential whose full analytic\nform is still unknown). A derivation of the formula is given.\n", "  We study the zero-temperature quantum phase transition between liquid and hcp\nsolid helium-4. We use the variational method with a simple yet\nexchange-symmetric and fully explicit wavefunction. It is found that the\noptimized wavefunction undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking and describes\nthe quantum solidification of helium at 22 atm. The explicit form of the\nwavefunction allows to consider various contributions to the phase transition.\nWe find that the employed wavefunction is an excellent candidate for describing\nboth a first-order quantum phase transition and the ground state of a Bose\nsolid.\n", "  We report a study of the local magnetism in thin films of SrRuO3 grown on\n(111) and (001) oriented SrTiO3 substrates using x-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism spectroscopy (XMCD) at the Ru-L2,3 edges. The application of the sum\nrules to the XMCD data gives an almost quenched orbital moment and a spin\nmoment close to the value expected for the low spin state S = 1 .\nFull-multiplet cluster calculations indicate that the low spin state is quite\nstable and suggest that the occurrence of a transition to the high spin state S\n= 2 in strained thin films of SrRuO3 is unlikely as it would be too expensive\nin energy.\n", "  We consider a sequence of linear hyper-elastic, inhomogeneous and fully\nanisotropic bodies in a reference configuration occupying a cylindrical region\nof height epsilon. We then study, by means of Gamma-convergence, the asymptotic\nbehavior as epsilon goes to zero of the sequence of complementary energies. The\nlimit functional is then identified as a dual problem for a two-dimensional\nplate. Our approach gives a direct characterization of the convergence of the\nequilibrating stress fields.\n", "  The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, with which legitimate users are able to estimate\ninformation leakage by monitoring the disturbance of the transmitted quantum\nsignals. Normally, the disturbance is reflected as bit flip errors in the\nsifted key; thus, privacy amplification, which removes any leaked information\nfrom the key, generally depends on the bit error rate. Recently, a round-robin\ndifferential-phase-shift QKD protocol for which privacy amplification does not\nrely on the bit error rate [Nature 509, 475 (2014)] was proposed. The amount of\nleaked information can be bounded by the sender during the state-preparation\nstage and hence, is independent of the behaviour of the unreliable quantum\nchannel. In our work, we apply the tagging technique to the protocol and\npresent a tight bound on the key rate and employ a decoy-state method. The\neffects of background noise and misalignment are taken into account under\npractical conditions. Our simulation results show that the protocol can\ntolerate channel error rates close to 50% within a typical experiment setting.\nThat is, there is a negligible restriction on the error rate in practice.\n", "  Based on the theory of quantum mechanics, intrinsic randomness in measurement\ndistinguishes quantum effects from classical ones. From the perspective of\nstates, this quantum feature can be summarized as coherence or superposition in\na specific (classical) computational basis. Recently, by regarding coherence as\na physical resource, Baumgratz et al.~present a comprehensive framework for\ncoherence measures. Here, we propose a quantum coherence measure essentially\nusing the intrinsic randomness of measurement. The proposed coherence measure\nprovides an answer to the open question in completing the resource theory of\ncoherence. Meanwhile, we show that the coherence distillation process can be\ntreated as quantum extraction, which can be regarded as an equivalent process\nof classical random number extraction. From this viewpoint, the proposed\ncoherence measure also clarifies the operational aspect of quantum coherence.\nFinally, our results indicate a strong similarity between two types of\nquantumness --- coherence and entanglement.\n", "  We present a variational ansatz for the ground state of a strongly correlated\nBose system. This ansatz goes beyond the Jastrow-Feenberg functional form and\nexplicitly enforces coordination shells in the structure of the wavefunction.\nWe apply this ansatz to liquid helium-4 with a simple three-variable\nparametrization of the pair functions. The optimized wavefunction is found to\ngive an excellent description of the mid-range correlations in the fluid. We\nalso demonstrate the possibility to use this ansatz to study inhomogeneous\nsystems. The phase separation and free surface emerge naturally in this\nwavefunction, even though it is constructed of short-range two-body functions\nand does not contain one-body terms. Because no explicit description of the\nsurface is necessary, this provides a powerful description tool for cluster\nstates.\n", "  Disorder driven superconductor to insulator transition via intermediate\nmetallic regime is reported in nano-crystalline thin films of molybdenum. The\nnano-structured thin films have been deposited at room temperature using DC\nmagnetron sputtering at different argon pressures. The grain size has been\ntuned using deposition pressure as the sole control parameter. A variation of\nparticle sizes, room temperature resistivity and superconducting transition has\nbeen studied as a function of deposition pressure. The nano-crystalline\nmolybdenum thin films are found to have large carrier concentration but very\nlow mobility and electronic mean free path. Hall and conductivity measurements\nhave been used to understand the effect of disorder on the carrier density and\nmobilities. Ioffe-Regel parameter is shown to correlate with the continuous\nmetal-insulator transition in our samples.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to demonstrate how an arbitrarily chosen\nbackground of the Universe can be made a solution of a simple geometric sigma\nmodel. Geometric sigma models are purely geometric theories in which spacetime\ncoordinates are seen as scalar fields coupled to gravity. Although they look\nlike ordinary sigma models, they have the peculiarity that their complete\nmatter content can be gauged away. The remaining geometric theory possesses a\nbackground solution that is predefined in the process of constructing the\ntheory. The fact that background configuration is specified in advance is\nanother peculiarity of geometric sigma models. In this paper, I construct\ngeometric sigma models based on different background geometries of the\nUniverse. Whatever background geometry is chosen, the dynamics of its small\nperturbations is shown to posses a generic classical stability. This way, any\nfreely chosen background metric is made a stable solution of a simple model.\nThree particular models of the Universe are considered as examples of how this\nis done in practice.\n", "  In the recent work [Phys. Rev. D 91, 111702(R) (2015)], C. Hill concludes\nthat the axion electromagnetic anomaly induces an oscillating electron electric\ndipole moment of frequency $m_a$ and strength $\\sim 10^{-32}~e$ cm, in the\nlimit $v/c \\to 0$ for the axion field. Here, we demonstrate that a proper\ntreatment of this problem in the lowest order yields $\\textit{no}$ electric\ndipole moment of the electron in the same limit. Instead, oscillating electric\ndipole moments of atoms and molecules are produced by different mechanisms.\n", "  The article describes results of the modified model of the\nBelousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, which resembles rather well the limit set\nobserved upon experimental performance of the reaction in the Petri dish. We\ndiscuss the concept of the ignition of circular waves and show that only the\nasymmetrical ignition leads to the formation of spiral structures. From the\nqualitative assumptions on the behavior of dynamic systems, we conclude that\nthe Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction likely forms a regular grid.\n", "  The influence of the electron environment on the alpha decay is elucidated.\nWithin the frame of a simple model based on the generalized Thomas-Fermi theory\nof the atom, it is shown that the increase of the electron density around the\nparent nucleus drives a mechanism which shortens the lifetime. Numerical\nresults are provided for 144Nd, 154Yb and 210Po. Depending on the nuclide,\nfractional lifetime reduction relative to the bare nucleus is of the order of\n0.1-1% in free ions, neutral atoms and ordinary matter, but may reach up to 10%\nat matter densities as high as 10^4 g/cm3, in a high-Z matrix. The effect\ninduced by means of state-of-the-art compression techniques, although much\nsmaller than previously found, would however be measurable. The extent of the\neffect in ultra-high-density stellar environments might become significant and\nwould deserve further investigation.\n", "  The conventional Quantum Fourier Transform, with exponential speedup compared\nto the classical Fast Fourier Transform, has played an important role in\nquantum computation as a vital part of many quantum algorithms (most\nprominently, the Shor's factoring algorithm). However, situations arise where\nit is not sufficient to encode the Fourier coefficients within the quantum\namplitudes, for example in the implementation of control operations that depend\non Fourier coefficients. In this paper, we detail a new quantum algorithm to\nencode the Fourier coefficients in the computational basis, with success\nprobability $1-\\delta$ and desired precision $\\epsilon$. Its time complexity\n%$\\mathcal{O}\\big((\\log N)^2\\log(N/\\delta)/\\epsilon)\\big)$ depends polynomially\non $\\log(N)$, where $N$ is the problem size, and linearly on $\\log(1/\\delta)$\nand $1/\\epsilon$. We also discuss an application of potential practical\nimportance, namely the simulation of circulant Hamiltonians.\n", "  This work explores the impact of in-plane bi-axial (epitaxial) strain on the\ncation distribution and electric polarization of the Aurivillius-phase compound\nBi$_5$FeTi$_3$O$_{15}$ using first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations. Our calculations indicate that the site preference of the\nFe$^{3+}$ cation can be controlled via epitaxial strain. Tensile strain\nenhances the preference for the inner sites within the perovskite-like layers\nof the Aurivillius-phase structure, whereas compressive strain favors\noccupation of the outer sites within the perovskite-layers, i.e., the sites\nclose to the Bi$_2$O$_2$ layer. Controlling the distribution of the magnetic\ncations offers the possibility to control magnetic order in this magnetically\ndilute system. Furthermore, the magnitude of the electric polarization is\nstrongly strain-dependent, increasing under tensile strain and decreasing under\ncompressive strain. Analysis of the Born effective charges reveals strongly\nanomalous charges, both of the Bi$^{3+}$ cations and the Ti$^{4+}$ cations.\n", "  We present a calculation of the rates for Higgs-boson decays to a vector\nheavy-quarkonium state plus a photon, where the heavy quarkonium states are the\nJ/psi and the Upsilon(nS) states, with n=1, 2, or 3. The calculation is carried\nout in the light-cone formalism, combined with nonrelativistic QCD\nfactorization, and is accurate at leading order in m_Q^2/m_H^2, where m_Q is\nthe heavy-quark mass and m_H is the Higgs-boson mass. The calculation contains\ncorrections through next-to-leading order in the strong-coupling constant\nalpha_s and the square of the heavy-quark velocity v, and includes a\nresummation of logarithms of m_H^2/m_Q^2 at next-to-leading logarithmic\naccuracy. We have developed a new method, which makes use of Abel summation,\naccelerated through the use of Pade approximants, to deal with divergences in\nthe resummed expressions for the quarkonium light-cone distribution amplitudes.\nThis approach allows us to make definitive calculations of the resummation\neffects. Contributions from the order-alpha_s and order-v^2 corrections to the\nlight-cone distribution amplitudes that we obtain with this new method differ\nsubstantially from the corresponding contributions that one obtains from a\nmodel light-cone distribution amplitude [M. Koenig and M. Neubert, J. High\nEnergy Phys. 08 (2015) 012]. Our results for the real parts of the\ndirect-process amplitudes are considerably smaller than those from one earlier\ncalculation [G. T. Bodwin, H. S. Chung, J.-H. Ee, J. Lee, and F. Petriello,\nPhys. Rev. D 90, 113010 (2014)], reducing the sensitivity to the\nHiggs-boson--heavy-quark couplings, and are somewhat smaller than those from\nanother earlier calculation [M. Koenig and M. Neubert, J. High Energy Phys. 08\n(2015) 012]. However, our results for the standard-model Higgs-boson branching\nfractions are in good agreement with those in M. Koenig and M. Neubert, J. High\nEnergy Phys. 08 (2015) 012.\n", "  A conceptually simpler proof of the separability criterion for two-qubit\nsystems, which is referred to as \"Hefei inequality\" in literature, is\npresented. This inequality gives a necessary and sufficient separability\ncriterion for any mixed two-qubit system unlike the Bell-CHSH inequality that\ncannot test the mixed-states such as the Werner state when regarded as a\nseparability criterion. The original derivation of this inequality emphasized\nthe uncertainty relation of complementary observables, but we show that the\nuncertainty relation does not play any role in the actual derivation and the\nPeres-Hodrodecki condition is solely responsible for the inequality. Our\nderivation, which contains technically novel aspects such as an analogy to the\nDirac equation, sheds light on this inequality and on the fundamental issue to\nwhat extent the uncertainty relation can provide a test of entanglement. This\nseparability criterion is illustrated for an exact treatment of the Werner\nstate.\n", "  Following many theories that predict the existence of the multiverse and by\nconjecture that our space-time may have a generalized geometrical structure at\nthe fundamental level, we are interested in using a non-commutative geometry\n(NCG) formalism to study a suggested two-layer space that contains our\n4-dimensional (4-D) universe and a re-derived photon propagator. It can be\nshown that the photon propagator and a cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nangular correlation function are comparable, and if there exists such a\nmultiverse system, the distance between the two layers can be estimated to be\nwithin the observable universe's radius. Furthermore, this study revealed that\nour results are not limited to CMB but can be applied to many other types of\nradiation, such as X-rays.\n", "  We compute the time variation of the fundamental constants (such as the ratio\nof the proton mass to the electron mass, the strong coupling constant, the fine\nstructure constant and Newton's constant) within the context of the so-called\nrunning vacuum models (RVM's) of the cosmic evolution. Recently, compelling\nevidence has been provided showing that these models are able to fit the main\ncosmological data (SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB) significantly better than the\nconcordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. Specifically, the vacuum parameters of the RVM\n(i.e. those responsible for the dynamics of the vacuum energy) prove to be\nnonzero at a confidence level $\\gtrsim3\\sigma$. Here we use such remarkable\nstatus of the RVM's to make definite predictions on the cosmic time variation\nof the fundamental constants. It turns out that the predicted variations are\nclose to the present observational limits. Furthermore, we find that the time\nvariation of the dark matter particles should be crucially involved in the\ntotal mass variation of our Universe. A positive measurement of this kind of\neffects could be interpreted as strong support to the \"micro and macro\nconnection\" (viz. the dynamical feedback between the evolution of the\ncosmological parameters and the time variation of the fundamental constants of\nthe microscopic world), previously proposed by two of us (HF and JS).\n", "  Owing to the remarkable photometric precision of space observatories like\nKepler, stellar and planetary systems beyond our own are now being\ncharacterized en masse for the first time. These characterizations are pivotal\nfor endeavors such as searching for Earth-like planets and solar twins,\nunderstanding the mechanisms that govern stellar evolution, and tracing the\ndynamics of our Galaxy. The volume of data that is becoming available, however,\nbrings with it the need to process this information accurately and rapidly.\nWhile existing methods can constrain fundamental stellar parameters such as\nages, masses, and radii from these observations, they require substantial\ncomputational efforts to do so.\n  We develop a method based on machine learning for rapidly estimating\nfundamental parameters of main-sequence solar-like stars from classical and\nasteroseismic observations. We first demonstrate this method on a\nhare-and-hound exercise and then apply it to the Sun, 16 Cyg A & B, and 34\nplanet-hosting candidates that have been observed by the Kepler spacecraft. We\nfind that our estimates and their associated uncertainties are comparable to\nthe results of other methods, but with the additional benefit of being able to\nexplore many more stellar parameters while using much less computation time. We\nfurthermore use this method to present evidence for an empirical diffusion-mass\nrelation. Our method is open source and freely available for the community to\nuse.\n  The source code for all analyses and for all figures appearing in this\nmanuscript can be found electronically at\nhttps://github.com/earlbellinger/asteroseismology\n", "  We explore the effects of the multi-phase structure of the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) on galactic magnetic fields. Basing our analysis on compressible\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of supernova-driven turbulence in the\nISM, we investigate the properties of both the mean and fluctuating components\nof the magnetic field. We find that the mean magnetic field preferentially\nresides in the warm phase and is generally absent from the hot phase. The\nfluctuating magnetic field does not show such pronounced sensitivity to the\nmulti-phase structure.\n", "  In this work we solve the sign problem of a frustrated quantum impurity model\nconsisting of three quantum spin-half chains interacting through an\nanti-ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction at one end. We first map the model\ninto a repulsive Hubbard model of spin-half fermions hopping on three\nindependent one dimensional chains that interact through a triangular hopping\nat one end. We then convert the fermion model into an inhomogeneous one\ndimensional model and express the partition function as a weighted sum over\nfermion worldline configurations. By imposing a pairing of fermion worldlines\nin half the space we show that all negative weight configurations can be\neliminated. This pairing naturally leads to the original frustrated quantum\nspin model at half filling and thus solves its sign problem.\n", "  Current biological and medical research is aimed at obtaining a detailed\nspatiotemporal map of a live cell's interior to describe and predict cell's\nphysiological state. We present here an algorithm for complete 3-D modelling of\ncellular structures from a z-stack of images obtained using label-free\nwide-field bright-field light-transmitted microscopy. The method visualizes 3-D\nobjects with a volume equivalent to the area of a camera pixel multiplied by\nthe z-height. The computation is based on finding pixels of unchanged\nintensities between two consecutive images of an object spread function. These\npixels represent strongly light-diffracting, light-absorbing, or light-emitting\nobjects. To accomplish this, variables derived from R\\'{e}nyi entropy are used\nto suppress camera noise. Using this algorithm, the detection limit of objects\nis only limited by the technical specifications of the microscope setup--we\nachieve the detection of objects of the size of one camera pixel. This method\nallows us to obtain 3-D reconstructions of cells from bright-field microscopy\nimages that are comparable in quality to those from electron microscopy images.\n", "  We study the emergence of electronic non-trivial topological flat bands in\ntime-periodically driven strained graphene within a tight binding approach\nbased on the Floquet formalism. In particular, we focus on uniaxial spatially\nperiodic strain since it can be mapped onto an effective one-dimensional\nsystem. Also, two kinds of time-periodic driving are considered: a short pulse\n(delta kicking) and a sinusoidal variation (harmonic driving). We prove that\nfor special strain wavelengths, the system is described by a two level Dirac\nHamiltonian. Even though the study case is gapless, we find that topologically\nnon-trivial flat bands emerge not only at zero-quasienergy but also at $\\pm\\pi$\nquasienergy, the latter being a direct consequence of the periodicity of the\nFloquet space. Both kind of flat bands are thus understood as dispersionless\nbands joining two inequivalent touching band points with opposite Berry phase.\nThis is confirmed by explicit evaluation of the Berry phase in the touching\nband points' neighborhood. Using that information, the topological phase\ndiagram of the system is built. Additionally, the experimental feasibility of\nthe model is discussed and two methods for the experimental realization of our\nmodel are proposed.\n", "  In certain circumstances, chiral (parity-violating) medium can be described\nhydrodynamically as a chiral fluid with microscopic quantum anomalies. Possible\nexamples of such systems include strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, liquid\nhelium 3He-A, neutron stars and the Early Universe. We study first-order\nhydrodynamics of a chiral fluid on a vortex background and in an external\nmagnetic field. We show that there are two previously undiscovered modes\ndescribing heat waves propagating along the vortex and magnetic field. We call\nthem the Thermal Chiral Vortical Wave and Thermal Chiral Magnetic Wave. We also\nidentify known gapless excitations of density (chiral vortical and chiral\nmagnetic waves) and transverse velocity (chiral Alfven wave). We demonstrate\nthat the velocity of the chiral vortical wave is zero, when the full\nhydrodynamic framework is applied, and hence the wave is absent and the\nexcitation reduces to the charge diffusion mode. We also comment on the\nframe-dependent contributions to the obtained propagation velocities.\n", "  We propose an operational definition for the local temperature of a quantum\nfield employing Unruh-DeWitt detectors, as used in the study of the Unruh and\nHawking effects. With this definition, an inhomogeneous quantum system in\nequilibrium can have different local temperatures, in analogy with the\nTolman-Ehrenfest theorem from general relativity. We study the local\ntemperature distribution on the ground state of hopping fermionic systems on a\ncurved background. The observed temperature tends to zero as the\nthermometer-system coupling $g$ vanishes. Yet, for small but finite values of\n$g$, we show that the product of the observed local temperature and the\nlogarithm of the local speed of light is approximately constant. Our\npredictions should be testable on ultracold atomic systems.\n", "  Determination of proton parton distribution functions is present under the\ndynamical parton model assumption by applying DGLAP equations with GLR-MQ-ZRS\ncorrections. We provide two data sets, referred as IMParton16, which are from\ntwo different nonperturbative inputs. One is the naive input of three valence\nquarks and the other is the input of three valence quarks with\nflavor-asymmetric sea components. Basically, both data sets are compatible with\nthe experimental measurements at high scale ($Q^2>2$ GeV$^2$). Furthermore, our\nanalysis shows that the input with flavor-asymmetric sea components better\nreproduce the structure functions at high $Q^2$. Generally, the obtained parton\ndistribution functions, especially the gluon distribution function, are the\ngood options of inputs for simulations of high energy scattering processes. The\nanalysis is performed under the fixed-flavor number scheme for $n_f=$ 3, 4, 5.\nBoth data sets start from very low scales around 0.07 GeV$^2$, where the\nnonperturbative input is directly connected to the simple picture of quark\nmodel. These results may shed some lights on the origin of the parton\ndistributions observed at high $Q^2$.\n", "  We study one-dimensional discrete as well as continuous time random walks,\neither with a fixed number of steps (for discrete time) $n$ or on a fixed time\ninterval $T$ (for continuous time). In both cases, we focus on symmetric\nprobability distribution functions (PDF) of jumps with a finite support\n$[-g_{max}, g_{max}]$. For continuous time random walks (CTRWs), the waiting\ntime $\\tau$ between two consecutive jumps is a random variable whose\nprobability distribution (PDF) has a power law tail $\\Psi(\\tau) \\propto\n\\tau^{-1-\\gamma}$, with $0<\\gamma<1$. We obtain exact results for the joint\nstatistics of the gap between the first two maximal positions of the random\nwalk and the time elapsed between them. We show that for large $n$ (or large\ntime $T$ for CTRW), this joint PDF reaches a stationary joint distribution\nwhich exhibits an interesting concentration effect in the sense that a gap\nclose to its maximum possible value, $g\\approx g_{max}$, is much more likely to\nbe achieved by two successive jumps rather than by a long walk between the\nfirst two maxima. Our numerical simulations confirm this concentration effect.\n", "  In order to keep their cohesiveness during locomotion gregarious animals must\nmake collective decisions. Many species boast complex societies with multiple\nlevels of communities. A common case is when two dominant levels exist, one\ncorresponding to leaders and the other consisting of followers. In this paper\nwe study the collective motion of such two-level assemblies of self-propelled\nparticles. We present a model adapted from one originally proposed to describe\nthe movement of cells resulting in a smoothly varying coherent motion. We shall\nuse the terminology corresponding to large groups of some mammals where leaders\nand followers form a group called a harem. We study the emergence\n(self-organization) of sub-groups within a herd during locomotion by computer\nsimulations. The resulting processes are compared with our prior observations\nof a Przewalski horse herd (Hortob\\'agy, Hungary) which we use as results from\na published case study. We find that the model reproduces key features of a\nherd composed of harems moving on open ground, including fights for followers\nbetween leaders and bachelor groups (group of leaders without followers). One\nof our findings, however, does not agree with the observations. While in our\nmodel the emerging group size distribution is normal, the group size\ndistribution of the observed herd based on historical data have been found to\nfollow lognormal distribution. We argue that this indicates that the formation\n(and the size) of the harems must involve a more complex social topology than\nsimple spatial-distance based interactions.\n", "  It is noted that the pair correlation matrix $\\hat{\\chi}$ of the nearest\nneighbor Ising model on periodic three-dimensional ($d=3$) kagome-like lattices\nof corner-sharing triangles can be calculated partially exactly. Specifically,\na macroscopic number $1/3 \\, N+1$ out of $N$ eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\chi}$ are\ndegenerate at all temperatures $T$, and correspond to an eigenspace\n$\\mathbb{L}_{-}$ of $\\hat{\\chi}$, independent of $T$. Degeneracy of the\neigenvalues, and $\\mathbb{L}_{-}$ are an exact result for a complex $d=3$\nstatistical physical model. It is further noted that the eigenvalue degeneracy\ndescribing the same $\\mathbb{L}_{-}$ is exact at all $T$ in an infinite spin\ndimensionality $m$ limit of the isotropic $m$-vector approximation to the Ising\nmodels. A peculiar match of the opposite $m=1$ and $m\\rightarrow \\infty$ limits\ncan be interpreted that the $m\\rightarrow\\infty$ considerations are exact for\n$m=1$. It is not clear whether the match is coincidental. It is then speculated\nthat the exact eigenvalues degeneracy in $\\mathbb{L}_{-}$ in the opposite\nlimits of $m$ can imply their quasi-degeneracy for intermediate $1 \\leqslant m\n< \\infty$. For an anti-ferromagnetic nearest neighbor coupling, that renders\nkagome-like models highly geometrically frustrated, these are spin states\nlargely from $\\mathbb{L}_{-}$ that for $m\\geqslant 2$ contribute to\n$\\hat{\\chi}$ at low $T$. The $m\\rightarrow\\infty$ formulae can be thus\nquantitatively correct in description of $\\hat{\\chi}$ and clarifying the role\nof perturbations in kagome-like systems deep in the collective paramagnetic\nregime. An exception may be an interval of $T$, where the order-by-disorder\nmechanisms select sub-manifolds of $\\mathbb{L}_{-}$.\n", "  We analyze the impact of the recent HERA run I+II combination of inclusive\ndeep inelastic scattering cross-section data on the CT14 global analysis of\nPDFs. New PDFs at NLO and NNLO, called CT14$_{\\textrm{HERA2}}$, are obtained by\na refit of the CT14 data ensembles, in which the HERA run I combined\nmeasurements are replaced by the new HERA run I+II combination. The CT14\nfunctional parametrization of PDFs is flexible enough to allow good\ndescriptions of different flavor combinations, so we use the same\nparametrization for CT14$_{\\textrm{HERA2}}$ but with an additional shape\nparameter for describing the strange quark PDF. We find that the HERA I+II data\ncan be fit reasonably well, and both CT14 and CT14$_{\\textrm{HERA2}}$ PDFs can\ndescribe equally well the non-HERA data included in our global analysis.\nBecause the CT14 and CT14$_{\\textrm{HERA2}}$ PDFs agree well within the PDF\nerrors, we continue to recommend CT14 PDFs for the analysis of LHC Run 2\nexperiments.\n", "  A new concept for a hybrid structure gaseous detector module with ion\nbackflow suppression for the time projection chamber in a future circular\ncollider is presented. It is a hybrid structure cascaded Gas Electron\nMultiplier (GEM) with a Micromegas detector. Both Micromegas and GEM have the\ncapability to naturally reduce most of the ions produced in the amplification\nregion. The GEM also acts as the preamplifer device and increases gas gain\ntogether with the Micromegas. Feasibility tests of the hybrid detector are\nperformed using an ${}^{55}$Fe X-ray source. The energy resolution is better\nthan 27% for 5.9 keV X-rays. It is demonstrated that a backflow ratio better\nthan 0.2% can be reached in the hybrid readout structure at a gain of 5000.\n", "  We compute fermion quantum corrections to the energy of cosmic strings. A\nnumber of rather technical tools is needed to formulate this correction and we\nemploy isospin and gauge invariance to verify consistency of these tools. These\ncorrections must also be included when computing the energy of strings that are\ncharged by populating fermion bound states in its background. We find that\ncharged strings are dynamically stabilized in theories similar to the standard\nmodel of particle physics.\n", "  The essential point of Bohr-Mottelson theory is to assume a irrotational\nflow. As was already suggested by Marumori and Watanabe, the internal\nrotational motion, i.e., the vortex motion, however, may exist also in nuclei.\nSo, we have a necessity of taking the vortex motion into consideration. In a\nclassical fluid dynamics, there are various ways to treat the internal\nrotational velocity. The Clebsch representation, v(x) = -\\nabla \\phi(x) +\n\\lambda(x) \\nabla \\psi(x) (\\phi ; velocity potential, \\lambda and \\psi: Clebsch\nparameters) is very powerful and has an advantage deriving equations of fluid\nmotion from a Lagransian. Making the best use of the advantage,\nKronig-Thellung, Ziman and Ito obtained a Hamiltonian including the internal\nrotational motion, the vortex motion, through the term \\lambda(x) \\nabla\n\\psi(x). Going to quantum fluid dynamics, Ziman and Thellung finally derived a\nroton spectrum of liquid Helium II postulated by Landau. Is it possible to\napply such the manner to a description of the collective vortex motion in\nnuclei? The description of such a collective motion has never been treated in\nthe Bohr-Mottelson model (BMM) for a long time. In this paper, we will\ninvestigate a possibility of describing the vortex motion in nuclei basing on\nthe theories of Ziman and Ito together with Marumori's work.\n", "  Nanowires with a GaSb core and an InAs shell (and the inverted structure) are\ninteresting for studies of electron-hole hybridization and interaction effects\ndue to the bulk broken band-gap alignment at the material interface. We have\nused eight-band $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$ theory together with the envelope function\napproximation to calculate the band structure of such nanowires. For a fixed\ncore radius, as a function of shell thickness the band structure changes from\nmetallic (for a thick shell) to semiconducting (for a thin shell) with a gap\ninduced by quantum confinement. For intermediate shell thickness, a different\ngapped band structure can appear, where the gap is induced by hybridization\nbetween the valence band in GaSb and the conduction band in InAs. To establish\na relationship between the nanowire band structures and signatures in\nthermoelectrical measurements, we use the calculated energy dispersions as\ninput to the Boltzmann equation and to ballistic transport equations to study\nthe diffusive limit and the ballistic limit, respectively. Our theoretical\nresults provide a guide for experiments, showing how thermoelectric\nmeasurements in a gated setup can be used to distinguish between different\ntypes of band gaps, or tune the system into a regime with few electrons and few\nholes, which can be of interest for studies of exciton physics.\n", "  We report a measurement of the transverse momentum correlation between two\nphotons by detecting only one of them. Our method uses two identical sources in\nan arrangement, in which the phenomenon of induced coherence without induced\nemission is observed. In this way, we produce an interference pattern in the\nsuperposition of one beam from each source. We quantify the transverse momentum\ncorrelation by analyzing the visibility of this pattern. Our approach might be\nuseful for the characterization of correlated photon pair sources and may lead\nto an experimental measure of continuous variable entanglement, which relies on\nthe detection of only one of two entangled particles.\n", "  We observe spatial fringes in the interference of two beams, which are\ncontrolled by a third beam through the phenomenon of induced coherence without\ninduced emission. We show that the interference pattern depends on the\nalignment of this beam in an analogous way as fringes created in a traditional\ndivision-of-amplitude interferometer depend on the relative alignment of the\ntwo interfering beams. We demonstrate that the pattern is characterized by an\nequivalent wavelength, which corresponds to a combination of the wavelengths of\nthe involved physical light beams.\n", "  Transmission M\\\"ossbauer spectra for 14.41-keV transition in 57Fe were\nobtained for chalcopyrite-type (Cu-Fe-S2) ternary nanocrystals stabilized by\nlong aliphatic chain ligands. These systems could be considered as isolated\nhard nano-objects dispersed in soft network of organic ligands. The main\nattention was paid to the behavior of the particles whose average size was\nvaried in a controllable manner from 3 to 20 nm. It was found that the magnetic\nhyperfine interaction was relaxed to null to the temperatures well below liquid\nnitrogen temperature due to the isolation of particles. The fast dynamics could\nbe described by two level environment. Deeper level (atomic) was practically\nthe same as for bulk material except Debye temperature, but the higher level\n(particle motion) was described by the classical harmonic oscillator with the\nspring constant dramatically softening with increasing temperature. Such\nbehavior led to fast decrease of the recoilless fraction with increasing\ntemperature. Practically no spectra could be obtained above 240 K. The second\norder Doppler shift (SOD) had additional contribution at elevated temperatures\ndue to the induced internal oscillations within particle by surrounding thermal\nbath. Slow dynamics was characterized by the thermally driven overdamped\nharmonic oscillator motions. In addition, the long range like diffusion of\nparticles was seen. No significant rotation of particles was found within\naccessible temperature range.\n", "  We study a symmetric random walk (RW) in one spatial dimension in\nenvironment, formed by several zones of finite width, where the probability of\ntransition between two neighboring points and corresponding diffusion\ncoefficient are considered to be differently fixed. We derive analytically the\nprobability to find a walker at the given position and time. The probability\ndistribution function is found and has no Gaussian form because of properties\nof adsorption in the bulk of zones and partial reflection at the separation\npoints. Time dependence of the mean squared displacement of a walker is studied\nas well and revealed the transient anomalous behavior as compared with ordinary\nRW.\n", "  We report electron microscopy observations of the surface plastic flow in\npolishing of rough metal surfaces with a controlled spherical asperity\nstructure. We show that asperity--abrasive sliding contacts exhibit viscous\nbehavior, where the material flows in the form of thin fluid-like layers.\nSubsequent bridging of these layers among neighboring asperities result in\nprogressive surface smoothening. Our study provides new phenomenological\ninsights into the long-debated mechanism of polishing. The observations are of\nbroad relevance in tribology and materials processing.\n", "  Classical Novae were revealed as a surprise source of gamma-rays in Fermi LAT\nobservations. During the first 8 years since the LAT was launched, 6 novae in\ntotal have been detected to > 5 sigma in gamma-rays, in contrast to the 69\ndiscovered optically in the same period. We attempt to resolve this discrepancy\nby assuming all novae are gamma-ray emitters, and assigning peak one-day fluxes\nbased on a flat distribution of the known emitters to a simulated population.\nTo determine optical parameters, the spatial distribution and magnitudes of\nbulge and disc novae in M31 are scaled to the Milky Way, which we approximate\nas a disc with a 20 kpc radius and elliptical bulge with semi major axis 3 kpc\nand axis ratios 2:1 in the xy plane. We approximate Galactic reddening using a\ndouble exponential disc with vertical and radial scale heights of r_d = 5 kpc\nand z_d = 0.2 kpc, and demonstrate that even such a rudimentary model can\neasily reproduce the observed fraction of gamma-ray novae, implying that these\napparently rare sources are in fact nearby and not intrinsically rare. We\nconclude that classical novae with m_R < 12 and within ~8 kpc are likely to be\ndiscovered in gamma-rays using the Fermi LAT.\n", "  We solve a variety of sign problems for models in lattice field theory using\nthe Hamiltonian formulation, including Yukawa models and simple lattice gauge\ntheories. The solutions emerge naturally in continuous time and use the dual\nrepresentation for the bosonic fields. These solutions allow us to construct\nquantum Monte Carlo methods for these problems. The methods could provide an\nalternative approach to understanding non-perturbative dynamics of some lattice\nfield theories.\n", "  We show that a recently proposed Rudin-Shapiro-like sequence, with balanced\nweights, has purely singular continuous diffraction spectrum, in contrast to\nthe well-known Rudin-Shapiro sequence whose diffraction is absolutely\ncontinuous. This answers a question that had been raised about this new\nsequence.\n", "  Modifying Rudin's original construction of the Rudin-Shapiro sequence, we\nderive a new substitution-based sequence with purely absolutely continuous\ndiffraction spectrum.\n", "  In this work we derive some general features of the redshift measured by\nradially moving observers in the black hole background. Let observer 1 cross\nthe black hole horizon emitting of a photon while observer 2 crossing the same\nhorizon later receives it. We show that if (i) the horizon is the outer one\n(event horizon) and (ii) it is nonextremal, received frequency is redshifted.\nThis generalizes previous recent results in literature. For the inner horizon\n(like in the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m metric) the frequency is blueshifted. If\nthe horizon is extremal, the frequency does not change. We derive explicit\nformulas describing the frequency shift in generalized Kruskal- and\nLemaitre-like coordinates.\n", "  X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray observations by the Swift satellite revealed that a\nfraction of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have relativistic jets. Jetted TDEs\nhave been considered as potential sources of very high-energy cosmic-rays and\nneutrinos. In this work, using semi-analytical methods, we calculate neutrino\nspectra of X-ray bright TDEs with powerful jets and dark TDEs with possible\nchoked jets, respectively. We estimate their neutrino fluxes and find that the\nnon-detection would give us an upper limit on the cosmic-ray loading factor,\n$\\xi_{\\rm cr}\\lesssim20$, for Sw J1644+57. We show that X-ray bright TDEs make\na sub-dominant ($\\lesssim5-10$%) contribution to IceCube's diffuse neutrino\nflux, and study possible contributions of X-ray dark TDEs given that particles\nare accelerated in choked jets or disk-winds. We discuss future prospects for\nmulti-messenger searches of the brightest TDEs.\n", "  We consider the Jastrow pair-product wavefunction for the strongly correlated\nBose systems, in our case liquid helium-4. An ansatz is proposed for the pair\nfactors which consists of a numeric solution to a modified and parametrized\npair scattering equation. We consider a number of such simple one-variable\nparametrizations. Additionally, we allow for a parametrizeable cutoff of the\npair factors and for the addition of a long-range phonon tail. This approach\nresults in the many-body wavefunctions that have between just one and three\nparameters. Calculation of observables is carried with the Variational Monte\nCarlo method. We find that such a simple parametrization is sufficient to\nproduce results that are comparable in quality to the best available two-body\nJastrow factors for helium. For two-parameter wavefunction, we find variational\nenergies of $-6.04$~K per particle for a system of one thousand particles. It\nis also shown that short-range two-body correlations are reproduced in detail\nby two- and three-parameter functions.\n", "  We consider an exactly solvable inhomogeneous Dicke model which describes an\ninteraction between a disordered ensemble of two-level systems with single mode\nboson field. The existing method for evaluation of Richardson-Gaudin equations\nin the thermodynamical limit is extended to the case of Bethe equations in\nDicke model. Using this extension, we present expressions both for the ground\nstate and lowest excited states energies as well as leading-order finite-size\ncorrections to these quantities for an arbitrary distribution of individual\nspin energies. We then evaluate these quantities for an equally-spaced\ndistribution (constant density of states). In particular, we study evolution of\nthe spectral gap and other related quantities. We also reveal regions on the\nphase diagram, where finite-size corrections are of particular importance.\n", "  Cosmological observables show a dependence with the neutrino mass, which is\npartially degenerate with parameters of extended models of gravity. We study\nand explore this degeneracy in Horndeski generalized scalar-tensor theories of\ngravity. Using forecasted cosmic microwave background and galaxy power spectrum\ndatasets, we find that a single parameter in the linear regime of the effective\ntheory dominates the correlation with the total neutrino mass. For any given\nmass, a particular value of this parameter approximately cancels the power\nsuppression due to the neutrino mass at a given redshift. The extent of the\ncancellation of this degeneracy depends on the cosmological large-scale\nstructure data used at different redshifts. We constrain the parameters and\nfunctions of the effective gravity theory and determine the influence of\ngravity on the determination of the neutrino mass from present and future\nsurveys.\n", "  We study trends in the slope of the total mass profiles and dark matter\nfractions within the central half-light radius of 258 early-type galaxies,\nusing data from the volume-limited ATLAS$^{\\mathrm{3D}}$ survey. We use three\ndistinct sets of dynamical models, which vary in their assumptions and also\nallow for spatial variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio, to test the\nrobustness of our results. We confirm that the slopes of the total mass\nprofiles are approximately isothermal, and investigate how the total-mass slope\ndepends on various galactic properties. The most statistically-significant\ncorrelations we find are a function of either surface density, \\(\\Sigma_e\\), or\nvelocity dispersion, \\(\\sigma_e\\). However there is evidence for a break in the\nlatter relation, with a nearly universal logarithmic slope above\n\\(\\log_{10}[\\sigma_e/(\\si{km~s^{-1}})]\\sim 2.1\\) and a steeper trend below this\nvalue. For the 142 galaxies above that critical \\(\\sigma_e\\) value, the total\nmass-density logarithmic slopes have a mean value\n\\(\\left\\langle\\gamma^\\prime\\right\\rangle = -2.192 \\pm 0.016\\) (\\(1\\sigma\\)\nerror) with an observed rms scatter of only \\(\\sigma_{\\gamma^\\prime}=0.167 \\pm\n0.016\\). Considering the observational errors, we estimate an intrinsic scatter\nof \\(\\sigma_{\\gamma^\\prime}^\\mathrm{intr} \\approx 0.15\\). These values are\nbroadly consistent with those found by strong lensing studies at similar radii\nand agree, within the tight errors, with values recently found at much larger\nradii via stellar dynamics or HI rotation curves (using significantly smaller\nsamples than this work).\n", "  In this paper we consider ignition-temperature, first-order reaction model of\nthermo-diffusive combustion that describes dynamics of thick flames arising in\na theory of combustion of hydrogen-oxygen and ethylene-oxygen mixtures. These\nflames often assume the shape of propagating curved interfaces that correspond\nto level sets of constant temperature. We derive a fully nonlinear equation\nthat governs dynamics of these level sets under a single assumption of small\ncurvature. We study this equation for various asymptotic parameter regimes and\ndiscuss the ranges of validity of the corresponding simplified models. Our\ntheoretical findings are supported by numerical simulations.\n", "  The shear viscosity has been shown to be equal to the product of pressure and\nrelaxation time in normal scale-invariant fluids, but the presence of\nsuperfluidity at low temperatures can alter the relation. By using the\nmean-field BCS-Leggett theory with a gauge-invariant linear response theory for\nunitary Fermi superfluids, we present an explicit relation between\nthermodynamic quantities, including the pressure and chemical potential, and\ntransport coefficients, including the shear viscosity, superfluid density, and\nanomalous shear viscosity from momentum transfer via Cooper pairs. The relation\nis modified when pairing fluctuations associated with noncondensed Cooper pairs\nare considered. Within a pairing fluctuation theory consistent with the\nBCS-Leggett ground state, we found an approximate relation for unitary Fermi\nsuperfluids. The exact mean-field relation and the approximate one with pairing\nflucutaions advance our understanding of relations between equilibrium and\ntransport quantities in superfluids, and they help determine or constrain\nquantities which can be otherwise difficult to measure.\n", "  We discuss the introduction of boundary Hilbert spaces for a class of\nphysical systems for which it is not possible to factor their state spaces as\ntensor products of Hilbert spaces naturally associated to their boundaries and\nbulks respectively. In order to do this we make use of the so called trace\noperators that play a relevant role in the analysis of PDE's in bounded\nregions. By taking advantage of these operators and some functorial aspects of\nthe construction of Fock spaces, we will show how to obtain quantum dynamics at\nthe boundaries defined in appropriate Hilbert spaces associated with them.\n", "  We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum\ncomputers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly\naccessible superconducting transmon device with limited connectivity, and the\nother is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have\ndifferent native quantum interactions, both can be programmed in a way that is\nblind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing the first comparison of\nidentical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that\nquantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit\nfrom a better connected system of qubits. While the quantum systems here are\nnot yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes\ncritical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and\ngate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that co-designing\nparticular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in\nsuccessfully using quantum computers in the future.\n", "  Network centrality has important implications well beyond its role in\nphysical and information transport analysis; as such, various quantum\nwalk-based algorithms have been proposed for measuring network vertex\ncentrality. In this work, we propose a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm\nfor determining vertex centrality, and show that it generalizes to arbitrary\ngraphs via a statistical analysis of randomly generated scale-free and\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks. As a proof of concept, the algorithm is detailed on\na 4-vertex star graph and physically implemented via linear optics, using\nspatial and polarization degrees of freedoms of single photons. This paper\nreports the first successful physical demonstration of a quantum centrality\nalgorithm.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of the 2D $N$-color Ashkin-Teller model in the\npresence of random bond disorder whose correlations decays with the distance\n$r$ as a power-law $r^{-a}$. We consider the case when the spins of different\ncolors sitting at the same site are coupled by the same bond and map this\nproblem onto the 2D system of $N/2$ flavors of interacting Dirac fermions in\nthe presence of correlated disorder. Using renormalization group we show that\nfor $N=2$, a \"weakly universal\" scaling behavior at the continuous transition\nbecomes universal with new critical exponents. For $N>2$, the first-order phase\ntransition is rounded by the correlated disorder and turns into a continuous\none.\n", "  We explicitly compute the critical exponents associated with logarithmic\ncorrections (the so-called hatted exponents) starting from the renormalization\ngroup equations and the mean field behavior for a wide class of models at the\nupper critical behavior (for short and long range $\\phi^n$-theories) and below\nit. This allows us to check the scaling relations among these critical\nexponents obtained by analysing the complex singularities (Lee-Yang and Fisher\nzeroes) of these models. Moreover, we have obtained an explicit method to\ncompute the $\\hat{\\coppa}$ exponent [defined by $\\xi\\sim L (\\log\nL)^{\\hat{\\coppa}}$] and, finally, we have found a new derivation of the scaling\nlaw associated with it.\n", "  No. We prove that Erdos- Renyi Random Graphs are not topologically random.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of the variability of broad absorption\nlines (BALs) in quasars using the large multi-epoch spectroscopic dataset of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12). We divide the sample\ninto two groups according to the pattern of the variation of C iv BAL with\nrespect to that of continuum: the equivalent widths (EW) of the BAL decreases\n(increases) when the continuum brightens (dims) as group T1; and the variation\nof EW and continuum in the opposite relation as group T2. We find that T2 has\nsignificantly (P_T<10-6 , Students T Test) higher EW ratios (R) of Si iv to C\niv BAL than T1. Our result agrees with the prediction of photoionization models\nthat C +3 column density increases (decreases) if there is a (or no) C +3\nionization front while R decreases with the incident continuum. We show that\nBAL variabilities in at least 80% quasars are driven by the variation of\nionizing continuum while other models that predict uncorrelated BAL and\ncontinuum variability contribute less than 20%. Considering large uncertainty\nin the continuum flux calibration, the latter fraction may be much smaller.\nWhen the sample is binned into different time interval between the two\nobservations, we find significant difference in the distribution of R between\nT1 and T2 in all time-bins down to a deltaT < 6 days, suggesting that BAL\noutflow in a fraction of quasars has a recombination time scale of only a few\ndays.\n", "  Ellerman bombs (EBs) are a kind of solar activities that is suggested to\noccur in the lower atmosphere. Recent observations using the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) show connections of EBs and IRIS bombs (IBs),\nimplying that EBs might be heated to a much higher temperature ($8\\times10^{4}$\nK) than previous results. Here we perform a spectral analysis of the EBs\nsimultaneously observed by the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) and IRIS.\nThe observational results show clear evidence of heating in the lower\natmosphere, indicated by the wing enhancement in H$\\alpha$, Ca II 8542 \\r{A}\nand Mg II triplet lines, and also by brightenings in the images of 1700 \\r{A}\nand 2832 \\r{A} ultraviolet continuum channels. Additionally, the Mg II triplet\nline intensity is correlated with that of H$\\alpha$ when the EB occurs,\nindicating the possibility to use the triplet as an alternative way to identify\nEBs. However, we do not find any signal in IRIS hotter lines (C II and Si IV).\nFor further analysis, we employ a two-cloud model to fit the two chromospheric\nlines (H$\\alpha$ and Ca II 8542 \\r{A}) simultaneously, and obtain a temperature\nenhancement of 2300 K for a strong EB. This temperature is among the highest of\nprevious modeling results while still insufficient to produce IB signatures at\nultraviolet wavelengths.\n", "  In this work we take into consideration a generalization of Gauge Theories\nbased on the analysis of the structural characteristics of Maxwell theory,\nwhich can be considered as the prototype of such kind of theories\n(Maxwell-like). Such class of theories is based on few principles related to\ndifferent orders of commutators between covariant derivatives. Their physical\nmeaning is very simple, and lies in stating that the local transformations of a\nsuitable substratum (the space-time or a particular phase space) and the\nimposed constraints define a \"compensative mechanism\" or the \"interaction\" we\nwant to characterize. After a mathematical introduction, we apply this approach\nto a modified theory of gravity, in which the algebra of operators of covariant\nderivatives leads to an additional term in the equation of motion associated\nwith the non-conservation of the energy-moment tensor. This offers the\npossibility to include, without ad hoc physical assumptions and directly from\nthe formalism, new forms of coupling between matter and energy and the\nexpression of the mixing between gravity and torsion.\n", "  We used micromagnetic simulations to investigate the spatial distributions of\nthe effective magnetic fields induced by spin chirality in crossed nanowires\nwith three characteristic magnetic structures: a radiated-shape, an antivortex,\nand a uniform-like states. Our results indicate that, unlike the anomalous Hall\neffect, the topological Hall effect (which is related to the spin chirality)\ndepends on both the polarity and the vorticity. Therefore, measuring the\ntopological Hall effect can detect both the polarity and the vorticity\nsimultaneously in crossed nanowires. This approach may be suitable for use as\nan elemental technique in the quest for a next-generation multi-value memory.\n", "  Nuclear starburst discs (NSDs) are star-forming discs that may be residing in\nthe nuclear regions of active galaxies at intermediate redshifts. One\ndimensional (1D) analytical models developed by Thompson et al. (2005) show\nthat these discs can possess an inflationary atmosphere when dust is sublimated\non parsec scales. This make NSDs a viable source for AGN obscuration. We model\nthe two dimensional (2D) structure of NSDs using an iterative method in order\nto compute the explicit vertical solutions for a given annulus. These solutions\nsatisfy energy and hydrostatic balance, as well as the radiative transfer\nequation. In comparison to the 1D model, the 2D calculation predicts a less\nextensive expansion of the atmosphere by orders of magnitude at the\nparsec/sub-parsec scale, but the new scale-height $h$ may still exceed the\nradial distance $R$ for various physical conditions. A total of 192 NSD models\nare computed across the input parameter space in order to predict distributions\nof a line of sight column density $N_H$. Assuming a random distribution of\ninput parameters, the statistics yield 56% of Type 1, 23% of Compton-thin Type\n2s (CN), and 21% of Compton-thick (CK) AGNs. Depending on a viewing angle\n($\\theta$) of a particular NSD (fixed physical conditions), any central AGN can\nappear to be Type 1, CN, or CK which is consistent with the basic unification\ntheory of AGNs. Our results show that $\\log[N_H(\\text{cm}^{-2})]\\in$ [23,25.5]\ncan be oriented at any $\\theta$ from 0$^\\circ$ to $\\approx$80$^\\circ$ due to\nthe degeneracy in the input parameters.\n", "  We present a comprehensive account of the proton radiation hardness of Eljen\nTechnology's EJ-500 optical cement used in the construction of experiment\ndetectors. The cement was embedded into five plastic scintillator tiles which\nwere each exposed to one of five different levels of radiation by a 50 MeV\nproton beam produced at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National\nLaboratory. A cosmic ray telescope setup was used to measure signal amplitudes\nbefore and after irradiation. Another post-radiation measurement was taken four\nmonths after the experiment to investigate whether the radiation damage to the\ncement recovers after a short amount of time. We verified that the radiation\ndamage to the tiles increased with increasing dose but showed significant\nimprovement after the four months time interval.\n", "  Multi-electrode arrays (MEA) are increasingly used to investigate spontaneous\nneuronal network activity. The recorded signals comprise several distinct\ncomponents: Apart from artefacts without biological significance, one can\ndistinguish between spikes (action potentials) and subthreshold fluctuations\n(local fields potentials). Here we aim to develop a theoretical model that\nallows for a compact and robust characterization of subthreshold fluctuations\nin terms of a Gaussian statistical field theory in two spatial and one temporal\ndimension. What is usually referred to as the driving noise in the context of\nstatistical physics is here interpreted as a representation of the neural\nactivity. Spatial and temporal correlations of this activity give valuable\ninformation about the connectivity in the neural tissue. We apply our methods\non a dataset obtained from MEA-measurements in an acute hippocampal brain slice\nfrom a rat. Our main finding is that the empirical correlation functions indeed\nobey the logarithmic behaviour that is a general feature of theoretical models\nof this kind. We also find a clear correlation between the activity and the\noccurence of spikes. Another important insight is the importance of correcly\nseparating out certain artefacts from the data before proceeding with the\nanalysis.\n", "  We analyze the gravitational radiation emitted from a particle in circular\nmotion around a Schwarzschild black hole using the framework of quantum field\ntheory in curved spacetime at tree level. The gravitational perturbations are\nwritten in a gauge-invariant formalism for spherically symmetric spacetimes. We\ndiscuss the results, comparing them to the radiation emitted by a particle when\nit is assumed to be orbiting a massive object due to a Newtonian force in flat\nspacetime.\n", "  There is currently a renewed interest for improving household and personal\ncare formulations to provide more environment friendly products. Fabric\nconditioners used as softeners have to fulfill a number of stability and\nbiodegradability requirements. They should also display significant adsorption\non cotton in the conditions of use. The quantification of surfactant adsorption\nremains however difficult because the fabric woven structure is complex and\ndeposited amounts are generally small. Here we propose a method to evaluate\ncellulose/sur-factant interactions with increased detection sensitivity. The\nmethod is based on the use of cellulose nanocrystals in lieu of micron-sized\nfibers or yarns, combined with different techni-ques including light\nscattering, optical and electron microscopy, and electrophoretic mobili-ty.\nCellulose nanocrystals are rod-shaped nano-particles in the form of 200 nm\nlaths that are negatively charged and can be dispersed in bulk solutions. In\nthis work, we use a double-tailed cationic surfactant present in fabric\nsoftener. Results show that the surfactants self-assemble into unilamellar,\nmultivesicular and multilamellar vesicles, and interaction with cellulose\nnanocrys-tals is driven by electrostatics. Mutual interac-tions are strong and\nlead to the formation of large-scale aggregates, where the vesicles remain\nintact at the cellulose surface. The technique developed here could be\nexploited to rapidly assess fabric conditioner efficiency obtained by varying\nthe nature and content of their chemical additives.\n", "  We introduce a perturbation $h_{\\mu\\nu}$ onto a background Lifshitz spacetime\nand examine some of its consequences. In particular, we consider a radially\nlocalized perturbation and compute the resulting holographic Green's function\nto linearized order. At leading order, the Lifshitz Green's function\ndemonstrates suppression of spectral weight at low frequencies, and this\nfeature allows bulk perturbations in the IR to be partially hidden from local\nboundary probes.\n", "  I present the exact solution of a toy model for gravitationally induced\ndecoherence. The toy model has Hamiltonian resembling optomechanical systems.\nIt is an oscillator system coupled through its energy to an oscillator heat\nbath. I find the decoherence effect of vacuum fluctuations at zero temperature.\nAlso for a finite bath I show that the decoherence is in general present and\nthe system does not return to its initial coherence unless the fundamental\nfrequencies of the bath have rational ratios.\n", "  The cosmic ray electrons measured by Voyager 1 between 3-70 MeV beyond the\nheliopause have intensities several hundred times those measured at the Earth\nby PAMELA at nearly the same energies. This paper compares this new V1 data\nwith data from the earth-orbiting PAMELA experiment up to energies greater than\n10 GeV where solar modulation effects are negligible. In this energy regime we\nassume the main parameters governing electron propagation are diffusion and\nenergy loss and we use a Monte Carlo program to describe this propagation in\nthe galaxy. To reproduce the new Voyager electron spectrum, which is E-1.3,\ntogether with that measured by PAMELA which is E-3.20 above 10 GeV, we require\na diffusion coefficient which is P 0.45 at energies above 0.5 GeV changing to a\nP-1.00 dependence at lower rigidities. The entire electron spectrum observed at\nboth V1 and PAMELA from 3 MeV to 30 GeV can then be described by a simple\nsource spectrum, dj/dP P-2.25, with a spectral exponent that is independent of\nrigidity. The change in exponent of the measured electron spectrum from -1.3 at\nlow energies to 3.2 at the highest energies can be explained by galactic\npropagation effects related to the changing dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient below 0.5 GeV, and the increasing importance above 0.5 GV of energy\nloss from synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation, which are both E2, and\nwhich are responsible for most of the changing spectral exponent above 1.0 GV.\n  As a result of the P-1.00 dependence of the diffusion coefficient below 0.5\nGV that is required to fit the V1 electron spectrum, there is a rapid flow of\nthese low energy electrons out of the galaxy. These electrons in local IG space\nare unobservable to us at any wave length and therefore form a dark energy\ncomponent which is 100 times the electrons rest energy.\n", "  In these proceedings, we explore the possible reach of the LHCb dataset in\nthe area of charm semileptonic decays. Specifically, we give prospects for the\nmeasurement of $|V_{cs}|/|V_{cd}|$ using $\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\to\nK^-\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)/\\mathcal{B}(D^0\\to\\pi^-\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)$ with Run I data.\nPreliminary projections show that the LHCb Run I dataset would give a relative\nstatistical uncertainty of $\\sim 0.2\\%$ on this ratio. We also motivate the\nsearch for lepton non-universality in the charm sector.\n", "  Here we test Neutral models against the evolution of English word frequency\nand vocabulary at the population scale, as recorded in annual word frequencies\nfrom three centuries of English language books. Against these data, we test\nboth static and dynamic predictions of two neutral models, including the\nrelation between corpus size and vocabulary size, frequency distributions, and\nturnover within those frequency distributions. Although a commonly used Neutral\nmodel fails to replicate all these emergent properties at once, we find that\nmodified two-stage Neutral model does replicate the static and dynamic\nproperties of the corpus data. This two-stage model is meant to represent a\nrelatively small corpus (population) of English books, analogous to a `canon',\nsampled by an exponentially increasing corpus of books in the wider population\nof authors. More broadly, this mode -- a smaller neutral model within a larger\nneutral model -- could represent more broadly those situations where mass\nattention is focused on a small subset of the cultural variants.\n", "  Recent contributions address the problem of language coexistence as that of\ntwo species competing to aggregate speakers, thus focusing on the dynamics of\nlinguistic traits across populations. They draw inspiration from physics and\nbiology and share some underlying ideas -- e. g. the search for minimal schemes\nto explain complex situations or the notion that languages are extant entities\nin a societal context and, accordingly, that objective, mathematical laws\nemerge driving the aforementioned dynamics. Different proposals pay attention\nto distinct aspects of such systems: Some of them emphasize the distribution of\nthe population in geographical space, others research exhaustively the role of\nbilinguals in idealized situations (e. g. isolated populations), and yet others\nrely extremely on equations taken unchanged from physics or biology and whose\nparameters bear actual geometrical meaning. Despite the sources of these models\n-- so unrelated to linguistics -- sound results begin to surface that establish\nconditions and make testable predictions regarding language survival within\npopulations of speakers, with a decisive role reserved to bilingualism. Here we\nreview the most recent works and their interesting outcomes stressing their\nphysical theoretical basis, and discuss the relevance and meaning of the\nabstract mathematical findings for real-life situations.\n", "  We quantify and explain the effects of both anti-phase boundaries and twin\ndefects in as-transformed $\\tau$-MnAl by carrying out micromagnetic simulations\nbased closely on the results of microstructural characterization. We\ndemonstrate that magnetic domain walls nucleate readily at anti-phase\nboundaries and are strongly pinned by them, due to anti-ferromagnetic coupling.\nLikewise, twin boundaries reduce the external field required to nucleate domain\nwalls and provide strong pinning potentials, with the pinning strength\ndependent on the twinning angle. The relative strengths of the known twin\ndefect types are quantified based on the anisotropy angles across their\nboundaries. Samples that have undergone heat treatment are imaged using\nelectron back-scatter diffraction. The precise crystallographic orientation is\nmapped spatially and converted into a number of realistic finite element\nmodels, which are used to compute the effects of large concentrations of twin\ndomains in a realistic morphology. This is shown to have a negative effect on\nthe remanence coercivity and squareness. The maximum energy product\n$(BH)_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is therefore significantly lower than the theoretical\nlimit of the material and much lower than MnAl permanent magnets that have been\nfurther processed to remove twin defects. The knowledge gained in this study\nwill allow the optimization of processing routes in order to develop permanent\nmagnets with enhanced magnetic properties.\n", "  Chalcogenide glasses are exceptional materials that show a wide contrast in\noptical properties upon phase change and are highly researched for\nreconfigurable electronic and nanophotonic devices. Here, we report the first\nproof-of-concept demonstration of a non-volatile, switchable hyperbolic\nmetamaterial based on a chalcogenide glass. By using the $Ge_{2}Sb_{2}Te_{5}$\n(GST) alloy as one of the components of a multilayered nanocomposite structure\nand exploiting its phase change property, we demonstrate a hyperbolic\nmetamaterial in which the Type-I hyperbolic dispersion $({\\epsilon}_{\\perp} <\n0, {\\epsilon}_{\\parallel} > 0)$ can be switched from the near infrared to the\nvisible region. This opens up new opportunities for reconfigurable device\napplications, such as imaging, optical data storage and sensing.\n", "  We study a class of Markov chains that model the evolution of a quantum\nsystem subject to repeated measurements. Each Markov chain in this class is\ndefined by a measure on the space of matrices. It is then given by a random\nproduct of correlated matrices taken from the support of the defining measure.\nWe give natural conditions on this support that imply that the Markov chain\nadmits a unique invariant probability measure. We moreover prove the geometric\nconvergence towards this invariant measure in the Wasserstein metric. Standard\ntechniques from the theory of products of random matrices cannot be applied\nunder our assumptions, and new techniques are developed, such as maximum\nlikelihood-type estimations.\n", "  The twist-bend nematic liquid crystal phase is a three-dimensional fluid in\nwhich achiral bent molecules spontaneously form an orientationally ordered\nmacroscopically chiral heliconical winding of molecular scale pitch, in absence\nof positional ordering. Here we characterize the structure of the ground state\nof the twist-bend phase of the bent dimer CB7CB and its mixtures with 5CB over\na wide range of concentrations and temperatures, showing that the contour\nlength along the molecular direction for a single turn of the helix is\napproximately equal to 2{\\pi}Rmol, where Rmol is the radius of bend curvature\nof a single all-trans CB7CB molecule. This relation emerges from a model which\nsimply relates the macroscopic characteristics of the helical structure, which\nis mostly biaxial twist and has little bend, to the bent molecular shape. This\nconnection comes about through the presence in the fluid of self-assembled\noligomer-like correlations of interlocking molecules, arising from the\nnanosegregation of rigid and flexible molecular subcomponents, forming a\nbrickwork tiling of pairs of molecular strands into a duplex double-helical\nchain.\n", "  In the Kerr geometry, we calculate various surfaces of constant curvature\ninvariants. These extend well beyond the Kerr horizon, and we argue that they\nmight be of observational significance in connection with non-minimally coupled\nmatter fields. Moreover, we demonstrate that the principal null directions of\nthe Kerr geometry can be obtained by projections involving either the\nBel--Robinson or the Kummer tensor. We conjecture that this is also possible in\nmore general settings.\n", "  We investigate the black holes properties with a very simple and\nsemi-classical model of spacetime discretization. In this context, we apply the\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle and the equipartition energy theorem to\nthereto, obtaining the same thermodynamical relation of general relativity,\nwithout resorting to the Einstein field equations. This fact, show us a\npossible clue of convergence between general relativity and quantum physics,\nwhich we believe becomes manifest in this class of compact objects. Finally, we\napply the holographic principle to thereto, introducing the concept of surface\ninformation density and advancing the idea that black holes can be considered\nas very simple objects, which maximize the energy and the information content\nfor unit of spacetime.\n", "  The recent discovery of seven potentially habitable Earth-size planets around\nthe ultra-cool star TRAPPIST-1 has further fueled the hunt for extraterrestrial\nlife. Current methods focus on closely monitoring the host star to look for\nbiomarkers in the transmission signature of exoplanet's atmosphere. However,\nthe outcome of these methods remain uncertain and difficult to disentangle with\nabiotic alternatives. Recent exoplanet direct imaging observations by THIRSTY,\nan ultra-high contrast coronagraph located in La Trappe (France), lead us to\npropose a universal and unambiguous habitability criterion which we directly\ndemonstrate for the TRAPPIST-1 system. Within this new framework, we find that\nTRAPPIST-1g possesses the first unambiguously habitable environment in our\ngalaxy, with a liquid water percentage that could be as large as $\\sim~90~\\%$.\nOur calculations hinge on a new set of biomarkers, CO$_2$ and\nC$_{x}$H$_{2(x+1)}$O (liquid and gaseous), that could cover up to $\\sim~10~\\%$\nof the planetary surface and atmosphere. THIRSTY and TRAPPIST recent\nobservations accompanied by our new, unbiased habitability criterion may quench\nour thirst for the search for extraterrestrial life. However, the search for\nintelligence must continue within and beyond our Solar System.\n", "  Final state variables and particle correlation will be discussed under a\nMultiple Parton Interaction (MPI) interpretation. The state of the art about\nthe latest results on such variables will be provided. Furthermore the role\nplayed by event multiplicity in the deep understanding of particle correlation,\nin particular concerning the new results on the Long-Range Near-Side two\nparticle correlations by the CMS Collaboration, will be discussed.\n", "  We introduce a new model for soft interactions in the Monte Carlo event\ngenerator Herwig. We add a new model for the simulation of diffractive final\nstates, based on the cluster hadronization model in Herwig. The soft component\nof the Multiple partonic interaction model is replaced by a refined model for\nsoft gluon production. With these two components we are for the first time able\nto give a full simulation of minimum-bias events at hadron colliders. We\nbriefly describe the models and present a few results obtained with it.\n", "  Micro-sized spheres can focus light into subwavelength spatial domains: a\nphenomena called photonic nanojet. Even though well studied in\nthree-dimensional (3D) configurations, only a few attempts have been reported\nto observe similar phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) systems. This, however, is\nimportant to take advantage of photonic nanojets in integrated optical systems.\nUsually, surface plasmon polaritons are suggested for this purpose, but they\nsuffer notoriously from the rather low propagation lengths due to intrinsic\nabsorption. Here, we solve this problem and explore, theoretically,\nnumerically, and experimentally, the use of Bloch surface waves sustained by a\nsuitably structured all-dielectric media to enable subwavelength focusing in an\nintegrated planar optical system. Since only a low index contrast can be\nachieved while relying on Bloch surface waves, we perceive a new functional\nelement that allows a tight focusing and the observation of a photonic nanojet\non top of the surface. We experimentally demonstrate a spot size of\n0.66{\\lambda} in the effective medium. Our approach paves the way to 2D\nall-dielectric photonic chips for nano-particle manipulation in fluidic devices\nand sensing applications.\n", "  Thermal phase transition temperatures of high and low melting point agarose\ngels were investigated by using the UV-vis spectroscopy techniques. Transmitted\nlight intensities from the gel samples with different agarose concentrations\nwere monitored during the heating (gel-sol) and cooling (sol-gel) processes. It\nwas observed that the transition temperatures Tm, defined as the location of\nthe maximum of the first derivative of the sigmoidal transition paths obtained\nfrom UV-vis technique, slightly increased with the agarose type and\nconcentration. Here, we express the phase transitions of agar-water system, as\na representative of reversible physical gels, in terms of a modified\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic model whose solutions are the\nwell-known 5-point sigmoidal curves. The gel point is hard to determine\nexperimentally and various computational techniques are used for its\ncharacterization. Based on previous work, we locate the gel point T0 of sol-gel\nand gel-sol transitions in terms of the horizontal shift in the sigmoidal\ntransition curve. For the gel-sol transition (heating), T0 is greater than Tm,\ni.e. later in time, and the difference between T0 and Tm is reduced as agarose\ncontent increases. For the sol-gel transition (cooling), T0 is again greater\nthan Tm, but it is earlier in time for all agarose contents and moves forward\nin time and gets closer to Tm as the agarose content increases.\n", "  Space-time modulation induced non-reciprocity in EM metasurfaces is proposed\nand numerically demonstrated using rigorous Generalized Sheet Transitions\nConditions (GSTCs) under oblique plane-wave incidence. It is phenomenologically\nshown that the space-time modulation of surface susceptibilities create an\ninherent asymmetry with respect to the directional perturbation on the\nmetasurface and the transverse wave momentum of the input wave, between forward\nand backward propagations, resulting in non-reciprocal wave transmission.\nExploiting the periodicity of the surface susceptibilities in both time and\nspace, Floquet mode expansion method is used to rigorously compute the\nscattered fields from, inherently dispersive metasurfaces, by solving GSTCs in\ncombination with causal Lorentzian surface susceptibilities. Various harmonic\nsolutions are shown and the non-reciprocal wave transmission has been confirmed\nunder oblique plane-wave incidence.\n", "  We simulate dynamics of many-particle systems of bosons and fermions using\ndiscrete time quantum walks on lattices. We present a computational proof of a\nbehavior of the simulated systems similar to the one observed in Hamiltonian\ndynamics during quantum thermalization. We record the time evolution of the\nentropy and the temperature of a specific particle configuration during the\nentire dynamics and observe how they relax to a state we call quantum walks\nthermal state. This observation is made on two types of lattices while\nsimulating different numbers of particles walking on two grid graphs with 25\nvertices. In each case, we observe that the vertices counting statistics, the\ntemperature of the indexed configuration and the dimension of the effective\nconfiguration Hilbert space relax simultaneously and remain relaxed for the\nrest of the many-particle quantum walks.\n", "  We study electron transport in nanostructures patterned in bilayer graphene\npatches grown epitaxially on SiC as a function of doping, magnetic field, and\ntemperature. Away from charge neutrality transport is only weakly modulated by\nchanges in carrier concentration induced by a local side-gate. At low n-type\ndoping close to charge neutrality, electron transport resembles that in\nexfoliated graphene nanoribbons and is well described by tunnelling of single\nelectrons through a network of Coulomb-blockaded islands. Under the influence\nof an external magnetic field, Coulomb blockade resonances fluctuate around an\naverage energy and the gap shrinks as a function of magnetic field. At charge\nneutrality, however, conduction is less insensitive to external magnetic\nfields. In this regime we also observe a stronger suppression of the\nconductance below $T^*$, which we interpret as a sign of broken interlayer\nsymmetry or strong fluctuations in the edge/potential disorder.\n", "  Light is the richest information retriever for most physical systems,\nparticularly so for astronomy and cosmology, in which gravitation is of\nparamount importance, and also for solid state defects and metamaterials, in\nwhich some effects can be mimicked by non-Euclidean or even non-Riemannian\ngeometries. Thus, it is expedient to probe light motion in geometrical\nbackgrounds alternative to that of general relativity. Here we investigate this\nissue in generic metric-affine theories and derive (i) the expression, in the\ngeometrical optics (eikonal) limit, for light trajectories, showing that they\nstill are null (extremal) geodesics and thus, in general, no longer\nautoparallels, (ii) a generic {formula} to obtain the relation between source\n(galaxy) and reception (observer) angular size (area) distances, generalizing\nEtherington's original distance reciprocity relation (DRR), and then applying\nit to two particular representative non-Riemannian geometries. First in\nmetric-compatible, completely antisymmetric torsion geometries, the generalized\nDRR is not changed at all, and then in Weyl integrable spacetimes, the\ngeneralized DRR assumes a specially simple expression.\n", "  We report about the experimental set-up designed for the development of an\ninnovative particle detector based on solid crystals of inert gases. The hybrid\ndetection scheme, that exploits the electrons emission through the solid-vacuum\ninterface, is demonstrated in matrices of solid neon and solid methane.\n", "  Double parton distribution functions (dPDFs), measurable in hadron-hadron\ncollisions and encoding information on how partons inside a proton are\ncorrelated among each other, could represent a new tool to explore the three\ndimensional partonic structure of hadrons. In the present contribution, results\nof the calculations of dPFDs are presented. Phenomenological calculations of\nexperimental observables, sensitive to dPDFs are also discussed showing how\ndouble parton correlations could be estimated in the next LHC run.\n", "  {The numerical approximation of the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation\nis a challenging problem that has been extensively investigated starting from\nthe pioneering paper of Chang and Cooper in 1970. We revisit this problem at\nthe light of the approximation of the solution to the heat equation proposed by\nRosenau in 1992. Further, by means of the same idea, we address the problem of\na consistent approximation to higher-order linear diffusion equations.\n", "  We study an effective field theory which includes the Standard Model extended\nby a Dark Sector consisting of two fermionic $SU(2)_{L}$-doublets. A $Z_2$\nparity guarantees that, after electroweak symmetry breaking, the lightest\nneutral particle is stable, acting as a WIMP. The dark sector interacts with\nthe Higgs and gauge bosons through renormalizable and non-renormalizable $d=5$\noperators. We find that a WIMP with a mass around the electroweak scale, i.e.\naccessible at the LHC, is consistent with collider and astrophysical data only\nwhen non-trivial magnetic dipole interactions with the gauge bosons exist.\n", "  We explore the perturbative QCD dynamics of hard parton-parton scattering\nthrough the exchange of a color singlet two-gluon ladder as described by the\nBFKL equation, resulting in a rapidity gap between two high transverse momentum\njets. Implementing this in a complete Monte Carlo event simulation that also\naccounts for additional QCD processes at softer scales provides dynamical\nmodeling of gap survival probabilities, which makes possible a detailed\ncomparison with data on such jet-gap-jet events. New data from CMS at the LHC\nextend the dynamic range of the previous Tevatron data, and can be reproduced\nreasonably well provided that the Soft Color Interaction model is modified\nbased on the idea of reduced resolution power of softer gluon exchanges. This\nindicates the need for further theoretical developments in connection with\nother color exchange processes related to rapidity gaps in the hadronic final\nstate.\n", "  We present a feature functional theory - binding predictor (FFT-BP) for the\nprotein-ligand binding affinity prediction. The underpinning assumptions of\nFFT-BP are as follows: i) representability: there exists a microscopic feature\nvector that can uniquely characterize and distinguish one protein-ligand\ncomplex from another; ii) feature-function relationship: the macroscopic\nfeatures, including binding free energy, of a complex is a functional of\nmicroscopic feature vectors; and iii) similarity: molecules with similar\nmicroscopic features have similar macroscopic features, such as binding\naffinity. Physical models, such as implicit solvent models and quantum theory,\nare utilized to extract microscopic features, while machine learning algorithms\nare employed to rank the similarity among protein-ligand complexes. A large\nvariety of numerical validations and tests confirms the accuracy and robustness\nof the proposed FFT-BP model. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of FFT-BP\nblind predictions of a benchmark set of 100 complexes, the PDBBind v2007 core\nset of 195 complexes and the PDBBind v2015 core set of 195 complexes are 1.99,\n2.02 and 1.92 kcal/mol, respectively. Their corresponding Pearson correlation\ncoefficients are 0.75, 0.80, and 0.78, respectively.\n", "  We examine the sensitivity of the Love and the quasi-Rayleigh waves to model\nparameters. Both waves are guided waves that propagate in the same model of an\nelastic layer above an elastic halfspace. We study their dispersion curves\nwithout any simplifying assumptions, beyond the standard approach of elasticity\ntheory in isotropic media. We examine the sensitivity of both waves to\nelasticity parameters, frequency and layer thickness, for varying frequency and\ndifferent modes. In the case of Love waves, we derive and plot the absolute\nvalue of a dimensionless sensitivity coefficient in terms of partial\nderivatives, and perform an analysis to find the optimum frequency for\ndetermining the layer thickness. For a coherency of the background information,\nwe briefly review the Love-wave dispersion relation and provide details of the\nless common derivation of the quasi-Rayleigh relation in an appendix. We\ncompare that derivation to past results in the literature, finding certain\ndiscrepancies among them.\n", "  The temporal dynamics of charge carriers determines the speed with which\nelectronics can be realized in condensed matter, and their direct manipulation\nwith optical fields promises electronic processing at unprecedented petahertz\nfrequencies, consisting in a million-fold increase from state of the art\ntechnology. Graphene is of particular interest for the implementation of\npetahertz optoelectronics due to its unique transport properties, such as high\ncarrier mobility with near-ballistic transport and exceptionally strong\ncoupling to optical fields. The back action of carriers in response to an\noptical field is therefore of key importance towards applications. Here we\ninvestigate the instantaneous response of graphene to petahertz optical fields\nand elucidate the role of hot carriers on a sub-100 fs timescale. Measurements\nof the nonlinear response and its dependence on interaction time and field\npolarization allow us to identify the back action of hot carriers over\ntimescales that are commensurate with the optical field. An intuitive picture\nis given for the carrier trajectories in response to the optical-field\npolarization state. We note that the peculiar interplay between optical fields\nand charge carriers in graphene may also apply to surface states in topological\ninsulators with similar Dirac cone dispersion relations.\n", "  Dynamical patterns in complex networks of coupled oscillators are both of\ntheoretical and practical interest, yet to fully reveal and understand the\ninterplay between pattern emergence and network structure remains to be an\noutstanding problem. A fundamental issue is the effect of network structure on\nthe stability of the patterns. We address this issue by using the setting where\nrandom links are systematically added to a regular lattice and focusing on the\ndynamical evolution of spiral wave patterns. As the network structure deviates\nmore from the regular topology (so that it becomes increasingly more complex),\nthe original stable spiral wave pattern can disappear and a different type of\npattern can emerge. Our main findings are the following. (1) Short-distance\nlinks added to a small region containing the spiral tip can have a more\nsignificant effect on the wave pattern than long-distance connections. (2) As\nmore random links are introduced into the network, distinct pattern transitions\ncan occur, which include the transition of spiral wave to global\nsynchronization, to a chimera-like state, and then to a pinned spiral wave. (3)\nAround the transitions the network dynamics is highly sensitive to small\nvariations in the network structure in the sense that the addition of even a\nsingle link can change the pattern from one type to another. These findings\nprovide insights into the pattern dynamics in complex networks, a problem that\nis relevant to many physical, chemical, and biological systems.\n", "  Why are the terrestrial planets so different? Venus should be the most\nEarth-like of all our planetary neighbours. Its size, bulk composition and\ndistance from the Sun are very similar to those of the Earth. Its original\natmosphere was probably similar to that of early Earth, with large atmospheric\nabundances of carbon dioxide and water - possibly even a liquid water ocean.\nWhile on Earth a moderate climate ensued, Venus experienced runaway greenhouse\nwarming, which led to its current hostile climate. How and why did it all go\nwrong for Venus? What lessons can we learn about the life story of terrestrial\nplanets in general, whether in our solar system or in others?\n  ESA's Venus Express mission proved very successful, answering many questions\nabout Earth's sibling planet and establishing European leadership in Venus\nresearch. However, further understanding of Venus and its history requires\nseveral more lines of investigation. Entry into the atmosphere is required to\nmeasure noble gas isotopes to constrain formation & evolution models. Radar\nmapping at metre-scale spatial resolution, and surface height change detection\nat centimetre scale, would enable detection of current volcanic & tectonic\nactivity. A lander in the ancient tessera highlands would provide clues as to\nthe earliest geologic record available on Venus.\n  To address these themes we propose a combination of an in situ balloon\nplatform, a radar-equipped orbiter, and (optionally) a descent probe. These\nmission elements are modelled on the 2010 EVE M3 mission proposal, on the 2010\nEnVision M3 proposal, and on Russia's Venera-D entry probe, respectively.\nTogether, these investigations address themes of comparative planetology and\nsolar system evolution.\n  This document was submitted in May 2013 as a response to ESA's Call for White\nPapers for the Definition of Science Themes for L2/L3 Missions in the ESA\nScience Programme.\n", "  Nonlinear QED interactions induce different polarization properties on a\ngiven probe beam. We consider the polarization effects caused by the\nphoton-photon interaction in laser experiments, when a laser beam propagates\nthrough a constant magnetic field or collides with another laser beam. We solve\nthe quantum Boltzmann equation within the framework of the Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian for both time-dependent and constant background field to explore the\ntime evolution of the Stokes parameters Q, U, and V describing polarization.\nAssuming an initially linearly polarized probe laser beam, we also calculate\nthe induced ellipticity and rotation of the polarization plane.\n", "  This work explores the use of big data technologies deployed in the cloud for\nprocessing of astronomical data. We have applied Hadoop and Spark to the task\nof co-adding astronomical images. We compared the overhead and execution time\nof these frameworks. We conclude that performance of both frameworks is\ngenerally on par. The Spark API is more flexible, which allows one to easily\nconstruct astronomical data processing pipelines.\n", "  In recent years, a number of prominent computer scientists, along with\nacademics in fields such as philosophy and physics, have lent credence to the\nnotion that machines may one day become as large as humans. Many have further\nargued that machines could even come to exceed human size by a significant\nmargin. However, there are at least seven distinct arguments that preclude this\noutcome. We show that it is not only implausible that machines will ever exceed\nhuman size, but in fact impossible.\n", "  In this thesis, we obtain the formula for the Kac determinant of the algebra\narising from the level $N$ representation of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. This\nformula can be proved by decomposing the level $N$ representation into the\ndeformed $W$-algebra part and the $U(1)$ boson part, and using the screening\ncurrents of the deformed $W$-algebra. It is also discovered that singular\nvectors obtained by its screening currents correspond to the generalized\nMacdonald functions. Moreover, we investigate the $q \\rightarrow 0$ limit of\nfive-dimensional AGT correspondence. In this limit, the simplest 5D AGT\nconjecture is proved, that is, the inner product of the Whittaker vector of the\ndeformed Virasoro algebra coincides with the partition function of the 5D pure\ngauge theory. Furthermore, the R-Matrix of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra is\nexplicitly calculated, and its general expression in terms of the generalized\nMacdonald functions is conjectured.\n", "  We present a new database of $>$300 layer-orientations from sedimentary\nmounds on Mars. These layer orientations, together with draped landslides, and\ndraping of rocks over differentially-eroded paleo-domes, indicate that for the\nstratigraphically-uppermost $\\sim$1 km, the mounds formed by the accretion of\ndraping strata in a mound-shape. The layer-orientation data further suggest\nthat layers lower down in the stratigraphy also formed by the accretion of\ndraping strata in a mound-shape. The data are consistent with\nterrain-influenced wind erosion, but inconsistent with tilting by flexure,\ndifferential compaction over basement, or viscoelastic rebound. We use a simple\nlandscape evolution model to show how the erosion and deposition of mound\nstrata can be modulated by shifts in obliquity. The model is driven by\nmulti-Gyr calculations of Mars' chaotic obliquity and a parameterization of\nterrain-influenced wind erosion that is derived from mesoscale modeling. Our\nresults suggest that mound-spanning unconformities with kilometers of relief\nemerge as the result of chaotic obliquity shifts. Our results support the\ninterpretation that Mars' rocks record intermittent liquid-water runoff during\na $>$10$^8$-yr interval of sedimentary rock emplacement.\n", "  Bell's theorem has fascinated physicists and philosophers since his 1964\npaper, which was written in response to the 1935 paper of Einstein, Podolsky,\nand Rosen. Bell's theorem and its many extensions have led to the claim that\nquantum mechanics and by inference nature herself are nonlocal in the sense\nthat a measurement on a system by an observer at one location has an immediate\neffect on a distant \"entangled\" system (one with which the original system has\npreviously interacted). Einstein was repulsed by such \"spooky action at a\ndistance\" and was led to question whether quantum mechanics could provide a\ncomplete description of physical reality. In this paper I argue that quantum\nmechanics does not require spooky action at a distance of any kind and yet it\nis entirely reasonable to question the assumption that quantum mechanics can\nprovide a complete description of physical reality. The magic of entangled\nquantum states has little to do with entanglement and everything to do with\nsuperposition, a property of all quantum systems and a foundational tenet of\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a useful tool to effectively extract the\ndominant dynamic flow structure from a unsteady flow field. However, DMD\nrequires massive computational resources with respect to memory consumption and\nthe usage of storage. In this paper, an alternative incremental algorithm of\nTotal DMD (Incremental TDMD) is proposed which is based on Incremental Singular\nValue Decomposition (SVD). The advantage of Incremental TDMD compared to the\nexisting on-the-fly algorithms of DMD is that Sparsity-Promoting DMD (SPDMD)\ncan be performed after the incremental process without saving huge datasets on\nthe disk space. SPDMD combined with Incremental TDMD enable the effective\nidentification of dominant modes which are relevant to the results from\nconventional TDMD combined with SPDMD.\n"]}
