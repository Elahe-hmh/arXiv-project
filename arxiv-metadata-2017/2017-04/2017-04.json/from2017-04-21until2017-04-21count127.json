Reynolds numbers of $Re_i=8\\cdot10^3$ and\n$Re_o=\\pm4\\cdot10^3$ of the inner and outer cylinders, respectively, are\nreached, corresponding to Taylor numbers Ta up to $10^8$. Effective scaling\nlaws for the torque and other system responses are found. Recent experiments\nwith the Twente turbulent Taylor-Couette ($T^3C$) setup and with a similar\nfacility in Maryland at very high Reynolds numbers have revealed an optimum\ntransport at a certain non-zero rotation rate ratio $a = -\\omega_o / \\omega_i$\nof about $a_{opt}=0.33-0.35$. For large enough $Ta$ in the numerically\naccessible range we also find such an optimum transport at non-zero\ncounter-rotation. The position of this maximum is found to shift with the\ndriving, reaching a maximum of $a_{opt}=0.15$ for $Ta=2.5\\cdot10^7$. An\nexplanation for this shift is elucidated, consistent with the experimental\nresult that $a_{opt}$ becomes approximately independent of the driving strength\nfor large enough Reynolds numbers. We furthermore numerically calculate the\nangular velocity profiles and visualize the different flow structures for the\nvarious regimes. By writing the equations in a frame co-rotating with the outer\ncylinder a link is found between the local angular velocity profiles and the\nglobal transport quantities.\n", "  Taylor-Couette flow with independently rotating inner (i) and outer (o)\ncylinders is explored numerically and experimentally to determine the effects\nof the radius ratio {\\eta} on the system response. Numerical simulations reach\nReynolds numbers of up to Re_i=9.5 x 10^3 and Re_o=5x10^3, corresponding to\nTaylor numbers of up to Ta=10^8 for four different radius ratios {\\eta}=r_i/r_o\nbetween 0.5 and 0.909. The experiments, performed in the Twente Turbulent\nTaylor-Couette (T^3C) setup, reach Reynolds numbers of up to Re_i=2x10^6$ and\nRe_o=1.5x10^6, corresponding to Ta=5x10^{12} for {\\eta}=0.714-0.909. Effective\nscaling laws for the torque J^{\\omega}(Ta) are found, which for sufficiently\nlarge driving Ta are independent of the radius ratio {\\eta}. As previously\nreported for {\\eta}=0.714, optimum transport at a non-zero Rossby number\nRo=r_i|{\\omega}_i-{\\omega}_o|/[2(r_o-r_i){\\omega}_o] is found in both\nexperiments and numerics. Ro_opt is found to depend on the radius ratio and the\ndriving of the system. At a driving in the range between {Ta\\sim3\\cdot10^8} and\n{Ta\\sim10^{10}}, Ro_opt saturates to an asymptotic {\\eta}-dependent value.\nTheoretical predictions for the asymptotic value of Ro_{opt} are compared to\nthe experimental results, and found to differ notably. Furthermore, the local\nangular velocity profiles from experiments and numerics are compared, and a\nlink between a flat bulk profile and optimum transport for all radius ratios is\nreported.\n", "  We consider an infinite planar straight strip perforated by small holes along\na curve. In such domain, we consider a general second order elliptic operator\nsubject to classical boundary conditions on the holes. Assuming that the\nperforation is non-periodic and satisfies rather weak assumptions, we describe\nall possible homogenized problems. Our main result is the norm resolvent\nconvergence of the perturbed operator to a homogenized one in various operator\nnorms and the estimates for the rate of convergence. On the basis of the norm\nresolvent convergence, we prove the convergence of the spectrum.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of turbulent Taylor-Couette flow are performed\nup to inner cylinder Reynolds numbers of {Re_i=10^5} for a radius ratio of\n{\\eta=r_i/r_o=0.714} between the inner and outer cylinder. With increasing\n{Re_i}, the flow undergoes transitions between three different regimes: (i) a\nflow dominated by large coherent structures, (ii) an intermediate transitional\nregime, and (iii) a flow with developed turbulence. In the first regime the\nlarge--scale rolls completely drive the meridional flow while in the second one\nthe coherent structures recover only on average. The presence of a mean flow\nallows for the coexistence of laminar and turbulent boundary layer dynamics. In\nthe third regime the mean flow effects fade away and the flow becomes dominated\nby plumes. The effect of the local driving on the azimuthal and angular\nvelocity profiles is quantified, in particular we show when and where those\nprofiles develop.\n", "  Taylor-Couette (TC) flow is used to probe the hydrodynamical stability of\nastrophysical accretion disks. Experimental data on the subcritical stability\nof TC are in conflict about the existence of turbulence (cf. Ji et al. Nature,\n444, 343-346 (2006) and Paoletti et al., A$\\&$A, 547, A64 (2012)), with\ndiscrepancies attributed to end-plate effects. In this paper we numerically\nsimulate TC flow with axially periodic boundary conditions to explore the\nexistence of sub-critical transitions to turbulence when no end-plates are\npresent. We start the simulations with a fully turbulent state in the unstable\nregime and enter the linearly stable regime by suddenly starting a\n(stabilizing) outer cylinder rotation. The shear Reynolds number of the\nturbulent initial state is up to $Re_s \\sim10^5$ and the radius ratio is\n$\\eta=0.714$. The stabilization causes the system to behave as a damped\noscillator and correspondingly the turbulence decays. The evolution of the\ntorque and turbulent kinetic energy is analysed and the periodicity and damping\nof the oscillations are quantified and explained as a function of shear\nReynolds number. Though the initially turbulent flow state decays,\nsurprisingly, the system is found to absorb energy during this decay.\n", "  The quark potential model for mesons and its extension for hybrid mesons are\nused to study the effects of radial excitations on the masses, sizes and radial\nwave functions at the origin for conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons.\nThese results can help in experimentally recognizing hybrid mesons. The\nproperties of conventional and hybrid charmonium mesons are calculated for the\nground and radially excited states using the shooting method to numerically\nsolve the required Schr\u007fodinger equation for the radial wave functions. We\ncompare our results with the experimentally observed masses and theoretically\npredicted results of the other models. Our results have implications for scalar\nform factors, energy shifts, and polarizabilities of conventional and hybrid\nmesons. The comparison of masses of conventional and hybrid charmonium meson\nwith the masses of recent discovered XYZ-particles is also discussed.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of Taylor-Couette flow (TC). Shear Reynolds\nnumbers of up to $3\\cdot10^5$, corresponding to Taylor numbers of\n$Ta=4.6\\cdot10^{10}$, were reached. Effective scaling laws for the torque are\npresented. The transition to the ultimate regime, in which asymptotic scaling\nlaws (with logarithmic corrections) for the torque are expected to hold up to\narbitrarily high driving, is analysed for different radius ratios $\\eta$,\ndifferent aspect ratios $\\Gamma$ and different rotation ratios $Ro$. It is\nshown that the transition is approximately independent of $Ro$ and $\\Gamma$,\nbut depends significantly on $\\eta$. We furthermore calculate the local angular\nvelocity profiles and visualize different flow regimes that depend both on the\nshearing of the flow, and the Coriolis force originating from the outer\ncylinder rotation. Two main regimes are distinguished, based on the magnitude\nof the Coriolis force, namely the co-rotating and weakly counter-rotating\nregime dominated by Rayleigh-unstable regions, and the strongly\ncounter-rotating regime where a mixture of stable and unstable regions exist.\nFurthermore, an analogy between $\\eta$ and outer-cylinder rotation is revealed,\nnamely that smaller gaps behave like a wider gap with co-rotating cylinders,\nand that wider gaps behave like smaller gaps with weakly counter-rotating\ncylinders. Finally, the effect of $\\Gamma$ on the effective torque versus $Ta$\nscaling is analysed and it is shown that different branches of the\ntorque-versus-$Ta$ relationships associated to different aspect ratios are\nfound to cross within $15%$ of the $Re$ associated to the transition to the\nultimate regime. The paper culminates in phase diagram in the inner vs outer\n$Re$ number parameter space and in the $Ta$ vs $Ro$ parameter space, which can\nbe seen as the extension of the Andereck \\emph{et al.} phase diagram towards\nthe ultimate regime.\n", "  Rayleigh--B\\'enard (RB) convection, the flow in a fluid layer heated from\nbelow and cooled from above, is used to analyze the transition to the\ngeostrophic regime of thermal convection. In the geostrophic regime, which is\nof direct relevance to most geo- and astrophysical flows, the system is\nstrongly rotated while maintaining a sufficiently large thermal driving to\ngenerate turbulence. We directly simulate the Navier--Stokes equations for two\nvalues of the thermal forcing, i.e. $Ra=10^{10}$ and $Ra=5\\cdot10^{10}$, a\nconstant Prandtl number~$Pr=1$, and vary the Ekman number in the range\n$Ek=1.3\\cdot10^{-7}$ to $Ek=2\\cdot10^{-6}$ which satisfies both requirements of\nsuper-criticality and strong rotation. We focus on the differences between the\napplication of no-slip vs. stress-free boundary conditions on the horizontal\nplates. The transition is found at roughly the same parameter values for both\nboundary conditions, i.e. at~$Ek\\approx 9\\times 10^{-7}$ for~$Ra=1\\times\n10^{10}$ and at~$Ek\\approx 3\\times 10^{-7}$ for~$Ra=5\\times 10^{10}$. However,\nthe transition is gradual and it does not exactly coincide in~$Ek$ for\ndifferent flow indicators. In particular, we report the characteristics of the\ntransitions in the heat transfer scaling laws, the boundary-layer thicknesses,\nthe bulk/boundary-layer distribution of dissipations and the mean temperature\ngradient in the bulk. The flow phenomenology in the geostrophic regime evolves\ndifferently for no-slip and stress-free plates. For stress-free conditions the\nformation of a large-scale barotropic vortex with associated inverse energy\ncascade is apparent. For no-slip plates, a turbulent state without large-scale\ncoherent structures is found; the absence of large-scale structure formation is\nreflected in the energy transfer in the sense that the inverse cascade, present\nfor stress-free boundary conditions, vanishes.\n", "  A polarized $ep/eA$ collider (Electron--Ion Collider, or EIC), with polarized\nproton and light-ion beams and unpolarized heavy-ion beams with a variable\ncenter--of--mass energy $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 20$ to $\\sim100$~GeV (upgradable to\n$\\sim 150$ GeV) and a luminosity up to $\\sim 10^{34} \\, \\textrm{cm}^{-2}\n\\textrm{s}^{-1}$, would be uniquely suited to address several outstanding\nquestions of Quantum Chromodynamics, and thereby lead to new qualitative and\nquantitative information on the microscopic structure of hadrons and nuclei.\nDuring this meeting at Jefferson Lab we addressed recent theoretical and\nexperimental developments in the spin and the three--dimensional structure of\nthe nucleon (sea quark and gluon spatial distributions, orbital motion,\npolarization, and their correlations). This mini--review contains a short\nupdate on progress in these areas since the EIC White\npaper~\\cite{Accardi:2012qut}.\n", "  We present a new method for the decomposition of multi-loop Euclidean Feynman\nintegrals into quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These are defined in shifted\ndimensions with higher powers of the propagators, make explicit both infrared\nand ultraviolet divergences, and allow for an immediate and trivial expansion\nin the parameter of dimensional regularization. Our approach avoids the\nintroduction of spurious structures and thereby leaves integrals particularly\naccessible to direct analytical integration techniques. Alternatively, the\nresulting convergent Feynman parameter integrals may be evaluated numerically.\nOur approach is guided by previous work by the second author but overcomes\npractical limitations of the original procedure by employing integration by\nparts reduction.\n", "  The origin and evolution of magnetic fields in the Universe is still an open\nquestion. Their observations in galaxies suggest strong magnetic fields already\nat high redshift as well as at present time. However, neither primordial\nmagnetic fields nor battery processes can account for such high field\nstrengths, which implies the presence of a dynamo process with rapid growth\nrates in high-redshift galaxies and subsequent maintenance against decay. We\ninvestigate the particular role played by feedback mechanisms in creating\nstrong fluid turbulence, allowing for a magnetic dynamo to emerge. Performing\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated cooling gas halos, we compare the\nmagnetic field evolution for various initial field topologies and various\nstellar feedback mechanisms. We find that feedback can indeed drive strong gas\nturbulence and dynamo action. We see typical properties of Kolmogorov\nturbulence with a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum, as well as a small-scale\ndynamo, with a $k^{3/2}$ magnetic energy spectrum predicted by Kazantsev dynamo\ntheory. We also investigate simulations with a final quiescent phase. As\nturbulence decreases, the galactic fountain settles into a thin, rotationally\nsupported disk. The magnetic field develops a large-scale, well-ordered\nstructure with even symmetry, which is in good agreement with magnetic field\nobservations of nearby spirals. Our findings suggest that weak initial seed\nfields were first amplified by a small-scale dynamo during a violent,\nfeedback-dominated early phase in the galaxy formation history, followed by a\nmore quiescent evolution, where the fields have slowly decayed or were\nmaintained via large-scale dynamo action.\n", "  For self-sustained oscillators subject to noise the coherence, understood as\na constancy of the instantaneous oscillation frequency, is one of the primary\ncharacteristics. The delayed feedback has been previously revealed to be an\nefficient tool for controlling coherence of noise-driven self-sustained\noscillator. The effect of the delayed feedback control on coherence is stronger\nfor a longer delay time. Meanwhile, the instantaneous frequency of a noise-free\noscillator can exhibit multistability for long delay time. The impact of the\ndelay-feedback--induced multistability on the oscillation coherence, measured\nby the phase diffusion constant, of a noisy oscillator is studied in this work\nboth numerically and analytically.\n", "  The family of metrics corresponding to the plane-fronted gravitational waves\nwith parallel propagation, commonly referred to as the family of pp-wave\nmetrics, is studied in the context of various modified gravitational models in\na self-contained and coherent manner by using a variant of the null coframe\nformulation of Newman and Penrose and the exterior algebra of differential\nforms on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds.\n", "  We construct a thermodynamic model for theoretical calculation of the boiling\nprocess of multicomponent mixtures of hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil). The model\ngoverns kinetics of the mixture composition in the course of the distillation\nprocess along with the boiling temperature increase. The model heavily relies\non the theory of dilute solutions of gases in liquids. Importantly, our results\nare applicable for modelling the process under elevated pressure (while the\nempiric models for oil cracking are not scalable to the case of extreme\npressure), such as in an oil field heated by lava intrusions.\n", "  Determination of trilinear Higgs coupling\n($\\lambda_{HHH}=\\kappa\\lambda_{HHH}^{\\rm SM}$) through Higgs pair productions\nis a major motivation for the LHC high luminosity phase. We perform a detailed\ncollider simulation to explore the potential of measuring $\\lambda_{HHH}$ in\nthe $VHH$ ($V=W,Z$) production at the HL-LHC. We find that the trilinear Higgs\ncoupling in the SM ($\\lambda_{HHH}^{\\rm SM}$) could be measured at the level of\n$1.3\\sigma$. Combining with the gluon fusion, vector boson fusion and\n$t\\bar{t}HH$ channels, $\\lambda_{HHH}^{\\rm SM}$ is expected to be measured at\nthe level of $3.13\\sigma$. If no evidence of Higgs pair productions were\nobserved, the $VHH$ production, together with the gluon fusion channel, would\nimpose a bound of $0.5\\leq \\kappa \\leq 2.2$ at the 95\\% confidence level.\n", "  Using our extension of the quark potential model to hybrid mesons that fits\nwell to the available lattice results, we now calculate the masses, radii, wave\nfunctions at origin, leptonic and two photon decay widths, E1 and M1 radiative\ntransitions for a significant number of bottomonium mesons. These mesons\ninclude both conventional and hybrid ones with radial and angular excitations.\nOur numerical solutions of the Schrodinger equation are related to QCD through\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approach. Relativistic corrections in masses and decay\nwidths are also calculated by applying the leading order perturbation theory.\nThe calculated results are compared with available experimental data and the\ntheoretical results by other groups. We also identify the states of\n$\\Upsilon(10860)$, $\\Upsilon(11020)$, and $Y_b(10890)$ mesons by comparing\ntheir experimental masses and decay widths with our results.\n", "  We prove that the quantum relative entropy decreases monotonically under the\napplication of any positive trace-preserving linear map, for underlying\nseparable Hilbert spaces. This answers in the affirmative a natural question\nthat has been open for a long time, as monotonicity had previously only been\nshown to hold under additional assumptions, such as complete positivity or\nSchwarz-positivity of the adjoint map. The first step in our proof is to show\nmonotonicity of the sandwiched Renyi divergences under positive\ntrace-preserving maps, extending a proof of the data processing inequality by\nBeigi [J. Math. Phys. 54, 122202 (2013)] that is based on complex interpolation\ntechniques. Our result calls into question several measures of non-Markovianity\nthat have been proposed, as these would assess all positive trace-preserving\ntime evolutions as Markovian.\n", "  The relationship between correlations and entanglement has played a major\nrole in understanding quantum theory since the work of Einstein, Podolsky and\nRosen (1935). Tsirelson (1980) proved that Bell states, shared among two\nparties, when measured suitably, achieve the maximum non-local correlations\nallowed by quantum mechanics. Conversely, Reichardt, Unger and Vazirani (2013)\nshowed that observing the maximal correlation value over a sequence of repeated\nmeasurements, implies that the underlying quantum state is close to a tensor\nproduct of maximally entangled states and, moreover, that it is measured\naccording to an ideal strategy. However, this strong rigidity result comes at a\nhigh price, requiring a large number of entangled pairs to be tested. In this\npaper, we present a significant improvement in terms of the overhead by instead\nconsidering quantum steering where the device of the one side is trusted. We\nfirst demonstrate a robust one-sided device-independent version of\nself-testing, which characterises the shared state and measurement operators of\ntwo parties up to a certain bound. We show that this bound is optimal up to\nconstant factors and we generalise the results for the most general attacks.\nThis leads us to a rigidity theorem for maximal steering correlations. As a key\napplication we give a one-sided device-independent protocol for verifiable\ndelegated quantum computation, and compare it to other existing protocols, to\nhighlight the cost of trust assumptions. Finally, we show that under reasonable\nassumptions, the states shared in order to run a certain type of verification\nprotocol must be unitarily equivalent to perfect Bell states.\n", "  We present a construction of kinematic quantum states for theories of tensor\nfields of an arbitrary sort. The construction is based on projective techniques\nby Kijowski. Applying projective quantum states for Loop Quantum Gravity\nobtained by Lanery and Thiemann we construct quantum states for LQG coupled to\ntensor fields.\n", "  The two-dimensional Dirac operator describes low-energy excitations in\ngraphene. Different choices for the boundary conditions give rise to\nqualitative differences in the spectrum of the resulting operator. For a family\nof boundary conditions, we find a lower bound to the spectral gap around zero,\nproportional to $|\\Omega|^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the\nbounded region where the Dirac operator acts. This family contains the\nso-called infinite mass and armchair cases used in the physics literature for\nthe description of graphene quantum dots.\n", "  A series of direct numerical simulations in large computational domains has\nbeen performed in order to probe the spatial feature robustness of the Taylor\nrolls in turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow. The latter is the flow between two\ncoaxial independently rotating cylinders of radius $r_i$ and $r_o$,\nrespectively. Large axial aspect ratios $\\Gamma = 7$-$8$ (with $\\Gamma =\nL/(r_o-r_i)$, and $L$ the axial length of the domain) and a simulation with\n$\\Gamma=14$ were used in order to allow the system to select the most unstable\nwavenumber and to possibly develop multiple states. The radius ratio was taken\nas $\\eta=r_i/r_o=0.909$, the inner cylinder Reynolds number was fixed to\n$Re_i=3.4\\cdot10^4$, and the outer cylinder was kept stationary, resulting in a\nfrictional Reynolds number of $Re_\\tau\\approx500$, except for the $\\Gamma=14$\nsimulation where $Re_i=1.5\\cdot10^4$ and $Re_\\tau\\approx240$. The large-scale\nrolls were found to remain axially pinned for all simulations. Depending on the\ninitial conditions, stable solutions with different number of rolls $n_r$ and\nroll wavelength $\\lambda_z$ were found for $\\Gamma=7$. The effect of\n$\\lambda_z$ and $n_r$ on the statistics was quantified. The torque and mean\nflow statistics were found to be independent of both $\\lambda_z$ and $n_r$,\nwhile the velocity fluctuations and energy spectra showed some box-size\ndependence. Finally, the axial velocity spectra was found to have a very sharp\ndrop off for wavelengths larger than $\\lambda_z$, while for the small\nwavelengths they collapse.\n", "  We consider the quantum processor based on a chain of trapped ions to propose\nan architecture wherein the motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions\n(position and momentum) could be exploited as the computational Hilbert space.\nWe adopt a continuous-variables approach to develop a toolbox of quantum\noperations to manipulate one or two vibrational modes at a time. Together with\nthe intrinsic non-linearity of the qubit degree of freedom, employed to mediate\nthe interaction between modes, arbitrary manipulation and readout of the ionic\nwave function could be achieved.\n", "  In what follows, we investigate the relation between the Friedmann and\nthermodynamic pressure equations, through solving the Friedmann and\nthermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously. Our investigation shows that a\nperfect fluid, as a suitable solution for the Friedmann equations leading to\nthe standard modelling of the universe expansion history, cannot simultaneously\nsatisfy the thermodynamic pressure equation and those of Friedmann. Moreover,\nwe consider various energy definitions, such as the Komar mass, and solve the\nFriedmann and thermodynamic pressure equations simultaneously to get some\nmodels for dark energy. The cosmological consequences of obtained solutions are\nalso addressed. Our results indicate that some of obtained solutions may unify\nthe dominated fluid in both the primary inflationary and current accelerating\neras into one model. In addition, by taking into account a cosmic fluid of a\nknown equation of state, and combining it with the Friedmann and thermodynamic\npressure equations, we obtain the corresponding energy of these cosmic fluids\nand face their limitations. Finally, we point out the cosmological features of\nthis cosmic fluid and also study its observational constraints.\n", "  We first construct the effective chiral Lagrangians for the $1^{-+}$ exotic\nmesons. With the infrared regularization scheme, we derive the one-loop\ninfrared singular chiral corrections to the $\\pi_1(1600)$ mass explicitly. We\ninvestigate the variation of the different chiral corrections with the pion\nmass under two schemes. Hopefully, the explicit non-analytical chiral\nstructures will be helpful to the chiral extrapolation of the lattice data from\nthe dynamical lattice QCD simulation of either the exotic light hybrid meson or\ntetraquark state.\n", "  Recent developments of the multiplex paradigm included efforts to understand\nthe role played by the presence of several layers on the dynamics of processes\nrunning on these networks. The possible existence of new phenomena associated\nto the richer topology has been discussed and examples of these differences\nhave been systematically searched. Here, we show that the interconnectivity of\nthe layers may have an important impact on the speed of the dynamics run in the\nnetwork and that microscopic changes such as the addition of one single\ninter-layer link can notably affect the arrival at a global stationary state.\nAs a practical verification, these results obtained with spectral techniques\nare confirmed with a Kuramoto dynamics for which the synchronization\nconsistently delays after the addition of single inter-layer links.\n", "  Effective field theories are the most general tool for the description of low\nenergy phenomena. They are universal and systematic: they can be formulated for\nany low energy systems we can think of and offer a clear guide on how to\ncalculate predictions with reliable error estimates, a feature that is called\npower counting. These properties can be easily understood in Wilsonian\nrenormalization, in which effective field theories are the low energy\nrenormalization group evolution of a more fundamental ---perhaps unknown or\nunsolvable--- high energy theory. In nuclear physics they provide the\npossibility of a theoretically sound derivation of nuclear forces without\nhaving to solve quantum chromodynamics explicitly. However there is the problem\nof how to organize calculations within nuclear effective field theory: the\ntraditional knowledge about power counting is perturbative but nuclear physics\nis not. Yet power counting can be derived in Wilsonian renormalization and\nthere is already a fairly good understanding of how to apply these ideas to\nnon-perturbative phenomena and in particular to nuclear physics. Here we review\na few of these ideas, explain power counting in two-nucleon scattering and\nreactions with external probes and hint at how to extend the present analysis\nbeyond the two-body problem.\n", "  It is well known that an accelerated charged particle radiates away energy.\nHowever, whether an accelerated neutral composite particle radiates away energy\nis unclear. We study decoherent Larmor radiation from an accelerated neutral\ncomposite object. We find that the neutral object's long wavelength radiation\nis highly suppressed because radiation from different charges is canceled out.\nHowever, the neutral object radiates high energy or short wavelength radiation\nwithout any suppression. In that case, radiation from each particle can be\ntreated independently, and it is called the decoherent radiation. We compare a\nhydrogen atom's decoherent Larmor radiation with its gravitational radiation\nwhile the atom is in a circular orbit around a star. Gravitational radiation is\nstronger than the electromagnetic radiation if the orbital radius is larger\nthan some critical radius. Since the decoherent radiation is related to the\nobject's structure, this implies that the strong equivalence principle which\nstates that gravitational motion does not depend on an object's constitution\nhas severe limitations..\n", "  In this work we study the equatorial causal geodesics of the Taub-NUT (TN)\nspace-time in comparison with \\emph{mass-less} TN space-time. We emphasized\nboth on the null circular geodesics and time-like circular geodesics. From the\neffective potential diagram of null and time-like geodesics, we differentiate\nthe geodesics structure between TN spacetime and mass-less TN space-time. It\nhas been shown that there is a key role of the NUT parameter to changes the\nshape of pattern of the potential well in the NUT spacetime in comparison with\n\\emph{mass-less} NUT space-time. We compared the ISCO (innermost stable\ncircular orbit), MBCO (marginally bound circular orbit) and CPO (circular\nphoton orbit) of the said space-time with graphically in comparison with\nmass-less cases. Moreover, we compute the radius of ISCO, MBCO and CPO for\n\\emph{extreme} TN black hole (BH). Interestingly, we show that these\n\\emph{three radii} coincides with the Killing horizon i.e. the null geodesic\ngenerators of the horizon. Finally in Appendix-A, we compute the center-of-mass\n(CM) energy for TN BH and mass-less TN BH. We show that in both cases the CM\nenergy is finite. For \\emph{extreme} NUT BH, we have found that the diverging\nnature of CM energy. \\emph{First}, we have observed that a non-asymptotic flat,\nspherically symmetric and stationary extreme BH is showing such feature.\n", "  We analyse the late time cosmology and the gravitational properties of doubly\ncoupled bigravity in the constrained vielbein formalism (equivalent to the\nmetric formalism) when the mass of the massive graviton is of the order of the\npresent Hubble rate. We focus on one of the two branches of background\ncosmology where the ratio between the scale factors of the two metrics is\nalgebraically determined. The Universe evolves from a matter dominated epoch to\na dark energy dominated era where the equation of state of dark energy can\nalways be made close to -1 now by appropriately tuning the graviton mass. We\nalso analyse the perturbative spectrum of the theory in the quasi static\napproximation well below the strong coupling scale where no instability is\npresent and we show that there are five scalar degrees of freedom, two vectors\nand two gravitons. In a cosmological FRW background for both metrics, four of\nthe five scalars are Newtonian potentials which lead to a modification of\ngravity on large scales. In this scalar sector, gravity is modified with\neffects on both the growth of structure and the lensing potential. In\nparticular, we find that the $\\Sigma$ parameter governing the Poisson equation\nof the weak lensing potential can differ from one in the recent past of the\nUniverse. Overall, the nature of the modification of gravity at low energy,\nwhich reveals itself in the growth of structure and the lensing potential, is\nintrinsically dependent on the couplings to matter and the potential term of\nthe vielbeins. We also find that the time variation of Newton's constant in the\nJordan frame can easily satisfy the bound from solar system tests of gravity.\nFinally we show that the two gravitons present in the spectrum have a\nnon-trivial mass matrix whose origin follows from the potential term of\nbigravity. This mixing leads to gravitational birefringence.\n", "  Simultaneous measurements of position and momentum are considered in $n$\ndimensions. We find, that for a particle whose position is strictly localized\nin a compact domain $D\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ (spatial uncertainty) with\nnon-empty boundary, the standard deviation of its momentum is sharply bounded\nby $\\sigma_p \\geq \\lambda_1^{1/2}\\hbar$, while $\\lambda_1$ is the first\nDirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian on $D$.\n", "  We consider what happens when a many body localized system is coupled to a\nheat bath. Unlike previous works, we do not restrict ourselves to the limit\nwhere the bath is large and effectively Markovian, nor to the limit where back\naction on the bath is negligible. We identify limits where the effect of the\nbath can be captured by classical noise, and limits where it cannot. We also\nidentify limits in which the bath delocalizes the system, as well as limits in\nwhich the system localizes the bath. Using general arguments and dimensional\nanalysis, we constrain the overall phase diagram of the coupled system and\nbath. Our analysis incorporates all the previously discussed regimes, and also\nuncovers a new intrinsically quantum regime that has not hitherto been\ndiscussed. We discuss baths that are themselves near a localization transition,\nor are strongly disordered but protected against localization by symmetry or\ntopology. We also discuss situations where the system and bath have different\ndimensionality (the case of `boundary MBL' and `boundary baths').\n", "  This article is an introductory review of the physics of quantum spin liquid\n(QSL) states. Quantum magnetism is a rapidly evolving field, and recent\ndevelopments reveal that the ground states and low-energy physics of frustrated\nspin systems may develop many exotic behaviors once we leave the regime of\nsemi-classical approaches. The purpose of this article is to introduce these\ndevelopments. The article begins by explaining how semi-classical approaches\nfail once quantum mechanics become important and then describes the alternative\napproaches for addressing the problem. We discuss mainly spin $1/2$ systems,\nand we spend most of our time in this article on one particular set of\nplausible spin liquid states in which spins are represented by fermions. These\nstates are spin-singlet states and may be viewed as an extension of Fermi\nliquid states to Mott insulators, and they are usually classified in the\ncategory of so-called $SU(2)$, $U(1)$ or $Z_2$ spin liquid states. We review\nthe basic theory regarding these states and the extensions of these states to\ninclude the effect of spin-orbit coupling and to higher spin ($S>1/2$) systems.\nTwo other important approaches with strong influences on the understanding of\nspin liquid states are also introduced: (i) matrix product states and projected\nentangled pair states and (ii) the Kitaev honeycomb model. Experimental\nprogress concerning spin liquid states in realistic materials, including\nanisotropic triangular lattice systems ($\\kappa$-(ET)$_{2}$Cu$_{2}$(CN)$_{3}$\nand EtMe$_{3}$Sb[(Pd(dmit)$_{2}$]$_{2}$), kagome lattice systems\n(ZnCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{2}$) and hyperkagome lattice systems\n(Na$_{4}$Ir$_{3}$O$_{8}$), is reviewed and compared against the corresponding\ntheories.\n", "  We study the influence of seasonally and geographically related daily\ndynamics of daylight and ambient temperature on human resting or sleeping\npatterns using mobile phone data of a large number of individuals. We observe\ntwo daily inactivity periods in the people's aggregated mobile phone calling\npatterns and infer these to represent the resting times of the population. We\nfind that the nocturnal resting period is strongly influenced by the length of\ndaylight, and that its seasonal variation depends on the latitude, such that\nfor people living in two different cities separated by eight latitudinal\ndegrees, the difference in the resting period of people between the summer and\nwinter in southern cities is almost twice that in the northern cities. We also\nobserve that the duration of the afternoon resting period is influenced by the\ntemperature, and that there is a threshold from which this influence sets in.\nFinally, we observe that the yearly dynamics of the afternoon and nocturnal\nresting periods appear to be counterbalancing each other. This also lends\nsupport to the notion that the total daily resting time of people is more or\nless conserved across the year.\n", "  We consider the viability of new heavy gauge singlet scalar particles at\ncolliders such as the LHC. Our original motivation for this study came from the\npossibility of a new heavy particle of mass ~ TeV decaying significantly into\ntwo photons at colliders, such as LHC, but our analysis applies more broadly.\nWe show that there are significant constraints from astrophysics and cosmology\non the simplest UV complete models that incorporate such new particles and its\nassociated collider signal. The simplest and most obvious UV complete model\nthat incorporates such signals is that it arises from a new singlet scalar (or\npseudo-scalar) coupled to a new electrically charged and colored heavy fermion.\nHere we show that these new fermions (and anti-fermions) would be produced in\nthe early universe, then form new color singlet heavy mesons with light quarks,\nobtain a non-negligible freeze-out abundance, and remain in kinetic equilibrium\nuntil decoupling. These heavy mesons possess interesting phenomenology,\ndependent on their charge, including forming new bound states with electrons\nand protons. We show that a significant number of these heavy states would\nsurvive for the age of the universe and an appreciable number would eventually\nbe contained within the earth and solar system. We show that this leads to\ndetectable consequences, including the production of highly energetic events\nfrom annihilations on earth, new spectral lines, and, spectacularly, the\ndestabilization of stars. The lack of detection of these consequences rules out\nsuch simple UV completions, putting pressure on the viability of such new\nparticles at LHC. To incorporate such a scalar would require either much more\ncomplicated UV completions or even further new physics that provides a decay\nchannel for the associated fermion.\n", "  The accurate determination of the maximum mass of the neutron stars is one of\nthe most important tasks in astrophysics. It is directly related to the\nidentification of the black holes in the universe, the production of neutron\nstars from the supernovae explosion, and the equation of state (EoS) of dense\nmatter. However, not only the EoS is directly connected with neutron star\nmasses, but also the speed of sound in dense matter is a crucial quantity which\ncharacterizes the stiffness of the EoS. The upper bound of the speed of sound\nimposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of neutron stars. However, this\nupper bound remains still an open issue. Recent observations, of binary neutron\nstar systems, offer the possibility of measuring with high accuracy both the\nmass and the tidal polarizability of the stars. We study possible effects of\nthe upper bound of the speed of sound on the upper bound of the mass and the\ntidal polarizability. We conclude that these kinds of measurements, combined\nwith recent observations of neutron stars with masses close to $2 M_{\\odot}$,\nwill provide robust constraints on the equation of state of hadronic matter at\nhigh densities.\n", "  Representative compounds of the new family of magnetic materials Gd5-xNdxSi4\nwere analyzed by X-ray diffraction at the XRD1 beamline at LNLS. To reduce\nX-ray absorption, thin layers of the powder samples were mounted outside the\ncapillaries and measured in Debye-Scherrer geometry as usual. The X-ray\ndiffraction analyses and the magnetometry results indicate that the behavior of\nthe magnetic transition temperature as a function of Nd content may be directly\nrelated to the average of the four smallest interatomic distances between\ndifferent rare earth sites of the majority phase of each compound. The quality\nand consistency of the results show that the XRD1 beamline is able to perform\nsatisfactory X-ray diffraction experiments on high-absorption materials even\noff the best conditions.\n", "  Nucleon capture cross sections enter various astrophysical processes. The\nmeasurement of proton capture on nuclei at astrophysically relevant low\nenergies is a challenge, and theoretical computations in this long-wavelength\nregime are sensitive to the long-distance asymptotics of the wave functions. A\ntheoretical foundation for estimating and correcting errors introduced in\ncapture cross sections due to Hilbert space truncation has so far been lacking.\nWe derive extrapolation formulas that relate the infrared regularized capture\namplitudes to the infinite basis limit and demonstrate their efficacy for\nproton-proton fusion. Our results are thus relevant to current calculations of\nfew-body capture reactions such as proton-proton fusion or proton capture on\nthe deuteron, and they also open the way for the use of {\\it ab initio}\nmany-body wave functions represented in finite Hilbert spaces in precision\ncalculations of nucleon capture on heavier nuclei.\n", "  A crystallographic displacive model is proposed for the extension twins in\nmagnesium. It is based on a hard-sphere assumption previously used for\nmartensitic transformations. The atomic displacements are established, and the\nhomogeneous lattice distortion is analytically expressed as a continuous\nangular-distortive matrix that takes the usual form of shear when the\ndistortion is complete. The calculations prove that a volume change of 3\npercents occurs for the intermediate states and that the twinning plane, even\nif untilted and restored when the distortion is complete, is not fully\ninvariant during the transient states. The crystallographic calculations also\nshow that the (90 deg, a) twins observed in magnesium nano-pillars and the (86\ndeg, a) twins observed in bulk samples come from the same mechanism, the only\ndifference being the existence of a slight obliquity angle (+/- 3.4 deg)\nrequired to reduce the strains in the latter case. Continuous features in the\npole figures between the low-misoriented (86 deg, a) twin variants are\nexpected; they are confirmed by EBSD maps acquired on a deformed magnesium\nsingle crystal. As the continuous mechanism of extension twinning is not a\nsimple shear, a \"virtual work\" criterion using the value of the intermediate\ndistortion matrix at the maximum volume change is proposed in place of the\nusual Schmid's law. It allows predicting the formation of extension twins for\ncrystal orientations associated with negative Schmid factors.\n", "  Recently, several extensions of massive vector theory in curved space-time\nhave been proposed in many literatures. In this paper, we consider the most\ngeneral vector-tensor theories that contain up to two derivatives with respect\nto metric and vector field. By imposing a degeneracy condition of the\nLagrangian in the context of ADM decomposition of space-time to eliminate an\nunwanted mode, we construct a new class of massive vector theories where five\ndegrees of freedom can propagate, corresponding to three for massive vector\nmodes and two for massless tensor modes. We find that the generalized Proca and\nthe beyond generalized Proca theories up to the quartic Lagrangian, which\nshould be included in this formulation, are degenerate theories even in curved\nspace-time. Finally, introducing new metric and vector field transformations,\nwe investigate the properties of thus obtained theories under such\ntransformations.\n", "  Magnetic frustration, which is well-defined in insulating systems with\nlocalized magnetic moments, yields exotic ground states like spin ices, spin\nglasses, or spin liquids. In metals magnetic frustration is less well defined\nbecause of the incipient delocalization of magnetic moments by the interaction\nwith conduction electrons, viz., the Kondo effect. Hence, the Kondo effect and\nmagnetic frustration are antithetic phenomena. Here we present experimental\ndata of electrical resistivity, magnetization, specific heat and neutron\ndiffraction on CePdAl, which is one of the rare examples of a geometrically\nfrustrated Kondo lattice, demonstrating that the combination of Kondo effect\nand magnetic frustration leads to an unusual ground state.\n", "  While Boolean logic has been the backbone of digital information processing,\nthere are classes of computationally hard problems wherein this conventional\nparadigm is fundamentally inefficient. Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to\nthe class of combinatorial optimization represents such a problem; and is well\nstudied for its wide spectrum of applications in data sciences, life sciences,\nsocial sciences and engineering and technology. This motivates alternate, and\nmore efficient non-Boolean pathways to their solution. Here, we demonstrate a\ncoupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits the\ninsulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2), to efficiently solve the\nvertex coloring of graphs. By harnessing the natural analogue between\noptimization, pertinent to graph coloring solutions, and energy minimization\nprocesses in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems, we harness the\nphysical manifestation of the latter process to approximate the optimal\ncoloring of k-partite graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection\nbetween the eigen properties of a linear dynamical system and the spectral\nalgorithms that can solve approximate graph coloring. Our work not only\nelucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing\nopportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard\nproblems efficiently.\n", "  Entanglement, describing the inseparability of a quantum multiparty system,\nis one of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics. Violation of Bell\ninequality, for ruling out the possibility of local hidden variable theories,\nis commonly used as a strong witness for quantum entanglement. In previous Bell\ntest experiments with photonic entanglement based on two-photon coincidence\nmeasurement, the photon temporal wave packets are absorbed completely by the\ndetectors. That is, the photon coherence time is much shorter than the\ndetection time window. Here we demonstrate generation of frequency-bin\nentangled narrowband biphotons, and for the first time, test the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality |S|<= 2 for their nonlocal\ntemporal correlations with time-resolved detection. We obtain a maximum |S|\nvalue of 2.52+/-0.48 that violates the CHSH inequality. Our result will have\napplications in quantum information processing involving time-frequency\nentanglement.\n", "  Lattice-switch Monte Carlo (LSMC) is a method for evaluating the free energy\nbetween two given solid phases. LSMC is a general method, being applicable to a\nwide range of problems and interatomic potentials. Furthermore it is extremely\nefficient, ostensibly more efficient than other existing general methods. Here\nwe introduce a package, monteswitch, which can be used to perform LSMC\nsimulations. The package can be used to evaluate the free energy differences\nbetween pairs of solid phases, including multicomponent phases, via LSMC for\natomic (i.e., non-molecular) systems in the NVT and NPT ensembles. It could\nalso be used to evaluate the free energy cost associated with interfaces and\ndefects. Regarding interatomic potentials, monteswitch currently supports\nvarious commonly-used pair potentials, including the hard-sphere,\nLennard-Jones, and Morse potentials, as well as the embedded atom model.\nHowever the main strength of the package is its versatility: it is designed so\nthat users can easily implement their own potentials.\n", "  Multiparticle quantum interference is critical for our understanding and\nexploitation of quantum information, and for fundamental tests of quantum\nmechanics. A remarkable example of multi-partite correlations is exhibited by\nthe Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. In a GHZ state, three particles\nare correlated while no pairwise correlation is found. The manifestation of\nthese strong correlations in an interferometric setting has been studied\ntheoretically since 1990 but no three-photon GHZ interferometer has been\nrealized experimentally. Here we demonstrate three-photon interference that\ndoes not originate from two-photon or single photon interference. We observe\nphase-dependent variation of three-photon coincidences with 90.5 \\pm 5.0 %\nvisibility in a generalized Franson interferometer using energy-time entangled\nphoton triplets. The demonstration of these strong correlations in an\ninterferometric setting provides new avenues for multiphoton interferometry,\nfundamental tests of quantum mechanics and quantum information applications in\nhigher dimensions.\n", "  We investigate a spin-electricity conversion effect in a topological\ninsulator/ferromagnet heterostructure. In the spin-momentum-locked surface\nstate, an electric current generates nonequilibrium spin accumulation, which\ncauses a spin-orbit torque that acts on the ferromagnet. When spins in the\nferromagnet are completely parallel to the accumulated spin, this spin-orbit\ntorque is zero. In the presence of spin excitations, however, a coupling\nbetween magnons and electrons enables us to obtain a nonvanishing torque. In\nthis paper, we consider a model of the heterostructure in which a\nthree-dimensional magnon gas is coupled with a two-dimensional massless Dirac\nelectron system at the interface. We calculate the torque induced by an\nelectric field, which can be interpreted as a magnon spin current, up to the\nlowest order of the electron-magnon interaction. We derive the expressions for\nhigh and low temperatures and estimate the order of magnitude of the induced\nspin current for realistic materials at room temperature.\n", "  We propose an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model that exhibits a\nquantum phase transition from the previously identified non-Fermi liquid fixed\npoint to a Fermi liquid like state, while still allowing an exact solution in a\nsuitable large $N$ limit. The extended model involves coupling the interacting\n$N$-site SYK model to a new set of $pN$ peripheral sites with only quadratic\nhopping terms between them. The conformal fixed point of the SYK model remains\na stable low energy phase below a critical ratio of peripheral sites $p<p_c(n)$\nthat depends on the fermion filling $n$. The scrambling dynamics throughout the\nnon-Fermi liquid phase is characterized by a universal Lyapunov exponent\n$\\lambda_L\\to 2\\pi T$ in the low temperature limit, however the temperature\nscale marking the crossover to the conformal regime vanishes continuously at\nthe critical point $p_c$. The residual entropy at $T\\to 0$, non zero in the\nNFL, also vanishes continuously at the critical point. For $p>p_c$ the\nquadratic sites effectively screen the SYK dynamics, leading to a quadratic\nfixed point in the low temperature and frequency limit. The interactions have a\nperturbative effect in this regime leading to scrambling with Lyapunov exponent\n$\\lambda_L\\propto T^2$.\n", "  It was recently shown how graphs can be used to provide descriptions of\npsychopathologies, where symptoms of, say, depression, affect each other and\ncertain configurations determine whether someone could fall into a sudden\ndepression. To analyse changes over time and characterise possible future\nbehaviour is rather difficult for large graphs. We describe the dynamics of\nnetworks using one-dimensional discrete time dynamical systems theory obtained\nfrom a mean field approach to (elementary) probabilistic cellular automata\n(PCA). Often the mean field approach is used on a regular graph (a grid or\ntorus) where each node has the same number of edges and the same probability of\nbecoming active. We show that we can use variations of the mean field of the\ngrid to describe the dynamics of the PCA on a random and small-world graph.\nBifurcation diagrams for the mean field of the grid, random, and small-world\ngraphs indicate possible phase transitions for certain parameter settings.\nExtensive simulations indicate for different graph sizes (number of nodes) that\nthe mean field approximation is accurate. The mean field approach allows us to\nprovide possible explanations of 'jumping' behaviour in depression.\n", "  We study a model of fully developed turbulence of a compressible fluid, based\non the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation, by means of the field theoretic\nrenormalization group. In this approach, scaling properties are related to the\nfixed points of the renormalization group equations. Previous analysis of this\nmodel near the real-world space dimension 3 identified some scaling regime\n[Theor. Math. Phys., 110, 3 (1997)]. The aim of the present paper is to explore\nthe existence of additional regimes, that could not be found using the direct\nperturbative approach of the previous work, and to analyze the crossover\nbetween different regimes. It seems possible to determine them near the special\nvalue of space dimension $4$ in the framework of double $y$ and $\\varepsilon$\nexpansion, where $y$ is the exponent associated with the random force and\n$\\varepsilon=4-d$ is the deviation from the space dimension $4$. Our\ncalculations show that there exists an additional fixed point that governs\nscaling behavior. Turbulent advection of a passive scalar (density) field by\nthis velocity ensemble is considered as well. We demonstrate that various\ncorrelation functions of the scalar field exhibit anomalous scaling behavior in\nthe inertial-convective range. The corresponding anomalous exponents,\nidentified as scaling dimensions of certain composite fields, can be\nsystematically calculated as a series in $y$ and $\\varepsilon$. All\ncalculations are performed in the leading one-loop approximation.\n", "  A global analysis of nuclear medium modifications of parton distributions is\npresented using deeply inelastic scattering data of various nuclear targets.\nTwo obtained data sets are provided for quark and gluon nuclear modification\nfactors, referred as nIMParton16. One is from the global fit only to the\nexperimental data of isospin-scalar nuclei (Set A), and the other is from the\nfit to all the measured nuclear data (Set B). The scale-dependence is described\nby DGLAP equations with nonlinear corrections in this work. The Fermi motion\nand off-shell effect, nucleon swelling, and parton-parton recombination are\ntaken into account together for modeling the complicated $x$-dependence of\nnuclear modification. The nuclear gluon shadowing in this paper is dynamically\ngenerated by the QCD evolution of parton splitting and recombination processes\nwith zero gluon density at the input scale. Sophisticated nuclear dependence of\nnuclear medium effects is studied with only two free parameters. With the\nobtained free parameters from the global analysis, the nuclear modifications of\nparton distribution functions of unmeasured nuclei can be predicted in our\nmodel. Nuclear modification of deuteron is also predicted and shown with recent\nmeasurement at JLab.\n", "  The temporal evolution of pulsed Spin Hall Effect - Spin Transfer Torque\n(SHE-STT) driven auto-oscillations in a Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) / platinum\n(Pt) microdisc is studied experimentally using time-resolved Brillouin Light\nScattering (BLS) spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the frequency of the\nauto-oscillations is different in the center and at the edge of the\ninvestigated disc that is related to the simultaneous STT excitation of a\nbullet and a non-localized spin-wave mode. Furthermore, the magnetization\nprecession intensity is found to saturate on a time scale of 20 ns or longer,\ndepending on the current density. For this reason, our findings suggest that a\nproper ratio between the current and the pulse duration is of crucial\nimportance for future STT-based devices.\n", "  Phosphorus atomic chains, the utmost-narrow nanostructures of black\nphosphorus (BP), are highly relevant to the in-depth development of BP into\none-dimensional (1D) regime. In this contribution, we report a top-down route\nto prepare atomic chains of BP via electron beam sculpting inside a\ntransmission electron microscope (TEM). The growth and dynamics (i.e. rupture\nand edge migration) of 1D phosphorus chains are experimentally captured for the\nfirst time. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviors and associated energetics of the\nas-formed phosphorus chains are further corroborated by density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations. The 1D counterpart of BP will serve as a novel\nplatform and inspire further exploration of the versatile properties of BP.\n", "  We present an analysis of the mass distribution in the region of the Galactic\nbulge, which leads to constraints on the total amount and distribution of Dark\nMatter (DM) therein. Our results -based on the dynamical measurement of the\nBRAVA collaboration- are quantitatively compatible with those of a recent\nanalysis, and generalised to a vaste sample of observationally inferred\nmorphologies of the stellar components in the region of the Galactic bulge. By\nfitting the inferred DM mass to a generalised NFW profile, we find that cores\n(index gamma smaller than 0.6) are forbidden only for very light configurations\nof the bulge, and that cusps (index gamma bigger than 1.2) are allowed, but not\nnecessarily preferred. Interestingly, we find that the results for the bulge\nregion are compatible with those obtained with dynamical methods (based on the\nrotation curve) applied to outer regions of the Milky Way, for all morphologies\nadopted. We find that the uncertainty on the shape of the stellar morphology\nheavily affects the determination of the DM distribution in the bulge region,\nwhich is gravitationally dominated by baryons, adding up to the uncertainty on\nits normalization. The combination of the two hinders the actual possibility to\ninfer sound conclusions about the distribution of DM in the region of the\nGalactic bulge, and only future observations of the stellar census and dynamics\nin this region will bring us closer to a quantitatively more definite answer.\n", "  We present an ab initio study of core excitations of solid-state materials\nfocussing on the role of electron-hole correlation. In the framework of an\nall-electron implementation of many-body perturbation theory into the exciting\ncode, we investigate three different absorption edges of three materials,\nspanning a broad energy window, with transition energies between a few hundred\nto thousands of eV. Specifically, we consider excitations from the Ti $K$ edge\nin rutile and anatase $\\textrm{TiO}_2$, from the Pb $M_4$ edge in\n$\\textrm{PbI}_2$, and from the Ca $L_{2,3}$ edge in $\\textrm{CaO}$. We show\nthat the electron-hole attraction rules x-ray absorption for deep core states,\nwhen local fields play a minor role. On the other hand, the local-field effects\nintroduced by the exchange interaction between the excited electron and the\nhole dominate excitation processes from shallower core levels, separated by a\nspin-orbit splitting of a few eV. Our approach yields absorption spectra in\ngood agreement with available experimental data, and allows for an in-depth\nanalysis of the results, revealing the electronic contributions to the\nexcitations, as well as their spatial distribution.\n", "  By means of the analytic parameterizations of quenching weights based on\nBDMPS formalism, the leading-order computations for nuclear Drell-Yan\ndifferential cross section rations as a function of the quark momentum fraction\nare performed with the nuclear geometry effect in Drell-Yan dimuon production.\nThe transport coefficient of the incoming quark energy loss in cold nuclear\nmatter is extracted with a global analysis of the experimental data from NA3\nand E866 collaborations. The extracted transport coefficient with the analytic\nparameterizations of BDMPS quenching weights is $\\hat{q}=0.37\\pm0.05$\nGeV$^{2}$/fm. It is found that our predictions are in good agrement with the\nexperimental measurements, and especially the agreement of calculations with\nNA3 experimental data has a significant improvement. The comparison of the\ntheoretical results and the corresponding experimental data demonstrates\nintuitively that the energy loss effect of incoming quark is particularly\nsignificant at lower incident proton energies. It is hoped that the obtained\nresults relevant to the NA3 experiment ($E_{beam}=150$ GeV) can provide useful\nreference for the forthcoming E906 Sea Quest experiment ($E_{beam}=120$ GeV).\n", "  A negative effective mass can be realized in quantum systems by engineering\nthe dispersion relation. A powerful method is provided by spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich is currently at the center of intense research efforts. Here we measure\nan expanding spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate whose dispersion\nfeatures a region of negative effective mass. We observe a range of dynamical\nphenomena, including the breaking of parity and of Galilean covariance,\ndynamical instabilities, and self-trapping. The experimental findings are\nreproduced by a single-band Gross-Pitaevskii simulation, demonstrating that the\nemerging features - shockwaves, soliton trains, self-trapping, etc. - originate\nfrom a modified dispersion. Our work also sheds new light on related phenomena\nin optical lattices, where the underlying periodic structure often complicates\ntheir interpretation.\n", "  Recently rediscovered black phosphorus is a layered semiconductor with\npromising electronic and photonic properties. Dynamic control of its bandgap\ncan enable novel device applications and allow for the exploration of new\nphysical phenomena. However, theoretical investigations and photoemission\nspectroscopy experiments performed on doped black phosphorus through potassium\nadsorption indicate that in its few-layer form, an exceedingly large electric\nfield in the order of several volts per nanometer is required to effectively\ntune its bandgap, making the direct electrical control unfeasible. Here we\ndemonstrate the tuning of bandgap in intrinsic black phosphorus using an\nelectric field directly and reveal the unique thickness-dependent bandgap\ntuning properties, arising from the strong interlayer electronic-state\ncoupling. Furthermore, leveraging a 10-nm-thick black phosphorus in which the\nfield-induced potential difference across the film dominates over the\ninterlayer coupling, we continuously tune its bandgap from ~300 to below 50\nmilli-electron volts, using a moderate displacement field up to 1.1 volts per\nnanometer. Such dynamic tuning of bandgap may not only extend the operational\nwavelength range of tunable black phosphorus photonic devices, but also pave\nthe way for the investigation of electrically tunable topological insulators\nand topological nodal semimetals.\n", "  A non-diagonal vielbein ansatz is applied to the $N$-dimension field\nequations of $f(T)$ gravity. An analytical vacuum solution is derived for the\nquadratic polynomial $f(T)=T+\\epsilon T^2$ in the presence of a cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$. Since the induced metric has off diagonal components, that\ncannot be removed by a mere of a coordinate transformation, the solution has a\nrotating parameter. The curvature and torsion scalars invariants are calculated\nto study the singularities and horizons of the solution. In contrast to the\ngeneral relativity (GR), the Cauchy horizon is differ from the horizon which\nshows the effect of the higher order torsion. The general expression of the\nenergy-momentum vector of $f(T)$ gravity is used to calculate the energy of the\nsystem. Finally, we have shown that this kind of solution satisfies the first\nlaw of thermodynamics in the framework of $f(T)$ gravitational theories.\n", "  Understanding the microscopic mechanism of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\ngrowth of two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (2D MoS2) is a fundamental issue\ntowards the function-oriented controlled growth. In this work, we report\nresults on revealing the growth kinetics of 2D MoS2 via capturing the\nnucleation seed, evolution morphology, edge structure and terminations at the\natomic scale during CVD growth using the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nand scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies. The direct growth\nof few- and mono-layer MoS2 onto graphene based TEM grids allow us to perform\nthe subsequent TEM characterization without any solution-based transfer. Two\nforms of seeding centers are observed during characterizations: (i)\nMo-oxysulfide (MoOxS2-y) nanoparticles either in multi-shelled fullerene-like\nstructures or in compact nanocrystals for the growth of fewer-layer MoS2; (ii)\nMo-S atomic clusters in case of monolayer MoS2. In particular, for the\nmonolayer case, at the early stage growth, the morphology appears in irregular\npolygon shape comprised with two primary edge terminations: S-Mo Klein edge and\nMo zigzag edge, approximately in equal numbers, while as the growth proceeds,\nthe morphology further evolves into near-triangle shape in which Mo zigzag edge\npredominates. Results from density-functional theory calculations are also\nconsistent with the inferred growth kinetics, and thus supportive to the growth\nmechanism we proposed. In general, the growth mechanisms found here should also\nbe applicable in other 2D materials, such as MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2 etc.\n", "  We show that the four-dimensional Lovelock-Cartan action can be derived from\na massless gauge theory for the $SO(1,3)$ group with an additional BRST trivial\npart. The model is originally composed by a topological sector and a BRST exact\npiece and has no explicit dependence on the metric, the vierbein or a mass\nparameter. The vierbein is introduced together with a mass parameter through\nsome BRST trivial constraints. The effect of the constraints is to identify the\nvierbein with some of the additional fields, transforming the original action\ninto the Lovelock-Cartan one. In this scenario, the mass parameter is\nidentified with Newton's constant while the gauge field is identified with the\nspin-connection. The symmetries of the model are also explored. Moreover, the\nextension of the model to a quantum version is qualitatively discussed.\n", "  Utilizing an exhaustive set of simplified models, we revisit dark matter\nscenarios potentially capable of generating the observed Galactic Center\ngamma-ray excess, updating constraints from the LUX and PandaX-II experiments,\nas well as from the LHC and other colliders. We identify a variety of\npseudoscalar mediated models that remain consistent with all constraints. In\ncontrast, dark matter candidates which annihilate through a spin-1 mediator are\nruled out by direct detection constraints unless the mass of the mediator is\nnear an annihilation resonance, or the mediator has a purely vector coupling to\nthe dark matter and a purely axial coupling to Standard Model fermions. All\nscenarios in which the dark matter annihilates through $t$-channel processes\nare now ruled out by a combination of the constraints from LUX/PandaX-II and\nthe LHC.\n", "  Approximating the frequency dispersion of the permittivity of materials with\nsimple analytical functions is of fundamental importance for understanding and\nmodeling the optical response of materials and resulting structures. In the\ngeneralized Drude-Lorentz model, the permittivity is described in the complex\nfrequency plane by a number of simple poles having complex weights, which is a\nphysically relevant and mathematically simple approach: By construction, it\nrespects causality represents physical resonances of the material, and can be\nimplemented easily in numerical simulations. We report here an efficient method\nof optimizing the fit of measured data with the Drude-Lorentz model having an\narbitrary number of poles. We show examples of such optimizations for gold,\nsilver, and copper, for different frequency ranges and up to four pairs of\nLorentz poles taken into account. We also provide a program implementing the\nmethod for general use.\n", "  Measurements of top quark spin observables in $t\\bar{t}$ events are presented\nbased on 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV proton-proton collisions recorded\nwith the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The analysis is performed in the dilepton\nfinal state, characterised by the presence of two isolated leptons (electrons\nor muons). There are 15 observables, each sensitive to a different coefficient\nof the spin density matrix of $t\\bar{t}$ production, which are measured\nindependently. Ten of these observables are measured for the first time. All of\nthem are corrected for detector resolution and acceptance effects back to the\nparton and stable-particle levels. The measured values of the observables at\nparton level are compared to Standard Model predictions at next-to-leading\norder in QCD. The corrected distributions at stable-particle level are\npresented and the means of the distributions are compared to Monte Carlo\npredictions. No significant deviation from the Standard Model is observed for\nany observable.\n", "  Quantum annealing is a promising technique which leverages quantum mechanics\nto solve hard optimization problems. Considerable progress has been made in the\ndevelopment of a physical quantum annealer, motivating the study of methods to\nenhance the efficiency of such a solver. In this work, we present a quantum\nannealing approach to measure similarity among molecular structures.\nImplementing real-world problems on a quantum annealer is challenging due to\nhardware limitations such as sparse connectivity, intrinsic control error, and\nlimited precision. In order to overcome the limited connectivity, a problem\nmust be reformulated using minor-embedding techniques. Using a real data set,\nwe investigate the performance of a quantum annealer in solving the molecular\nsimilarity problem. We provide experimental evidence that common practices for\nembedding can be replaced by new alternatives which mitigate some of the\nhardware limitations and enhance its performance. Common practices for\nembedding include minimizing either the number of qubits or the chain length,\nand determining the strength of ferromagnetic couplers empirically. We show\nthat current criteria for selecting an embedding do not improve the hardware's\nperformance for the molecular similarity problem. Furthermore, we use a\ntheoretical approach to determine the strength of ferromagnetic couplers. Such\nan approach removes the computational burden of the current empirical\napproaches, and also results in hardware solutions that can benefit from simple\nlocal classical improvement. Although our results are limited to the problems\nconsidered here, they can be generalized to guide future benchmarking studies.\n", "  We have performed an experiment demonstrating that loop\nstate-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) tomography [C. Jackson and S. J. van\nEnk, Phys. Rev. A 92, 042312 (2015)] is capable of detecting correlated errors\nbetween the preparation and the measurement of a quantum system. Specifically,\nwe have prepared pure and mixed states of single qubits encoded in the\npolarization of heralded individual photons. By performing measurements using\nmultiple state preparations and multiple measurement device settings we are\nable to detect if there are any correlated errors between them, and are also\nable to determine which state preparations are correlated with which\nmeasurements. This is accomplished by going around a 'loop' in parameter space,\nwhich allows us to check for self-consistency. No assumptions are made\nconcerning either the state preparations or the measurements, other than that\nthe dimensions of the states and the positive-operator-valued measures (POVM)\ndescribing the detector are known. In cases where no correlations are found we\nare able to perform quantum state tomography of the polarization qubits by\nusing knowledge of the detector POVMs, or quantum detector tomography by using\nknowledge of the state preparations.\n", "  We perform a Fourier space decomposition of the dynamics of non-linear\ncosmological structure formation in LCDM models. From N-body simulations\ninvolving only cold dark matter we calculate 3-dimensional non-linear density,\nvelocity divergence and vorticity Fourier realizations, and use these to\ncalculate the fully non-linear mode coupling integrals in the corresponding\nfluid equations. Our approach allows for a reconstruction of the amount of mode\ncoupling between any two wavenumbers as a function of redshift. With our\nFourier decomposition method we identify the transfer of power from larger to\nsmaller scales, the stable clustering regime, the scale where vorticity becomes\nimportant, and the suppression of the non-linear divergence power spectrum as\ncompared to linear theory. Our results can be used to improve and calibrate\nsemi-analytical structure formation models.\n", "  The charge dynamical response function of the Hubbard model is investigated\non the square lattice in the thermodynamical limit. The obtained charge\nexcitation spectra consist of a continuum, a gapless collective mode with\nanisotropic zero-sound velocity, and a correlation induced high-frequency mode\nat $\\omega\\approx U$. The correlation function is calculated from Gaussian\nfluctuations around the paramagnetic saddle-point within the Kotliar and\nRuckenstein slave-boson representation. Its dependence on the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion $U$ and density is studied in detail. An approximate analytical\nexpression of the high frequency mode, that holds for any lattice with one atom\nin the unit cell, is derived. Comparison with numerical simulations,\nperturbation theory and the polarization potential theory is carried out. We\nalso show that magnetic instabilities tend to vanish for $T\\gtrsim t/6$, and\nfinite temperature phase diagrams are established.\n", "  Quantum-chemical multi-configurational methods are required for a proper\ndescription of static electron correlation, a phenomenon inherent to the\nelectronic structure of molecules with multiple (near-)degenerate frontier\norbitals. Here, we review how a property of these frontier orbitals, namely the\nentanglement entropy is related to static electron correlation. A subset of\norbitals, the so-called active orbital space, is an essential ingredient for\nall multi-configurational methods. We proposed an automated selection of this\nactive orbital space, that would otherwise be a tedious and error prone manual\nprocedure, based on entanglement measures. Here, we extend this scheme to\ndemonstrate its capability for the selection of consistent active spaces for\nseveral excited states and along reaction coordinates.\n", "  Computational models in chemistry rely on a number of approximations. The\neffect of such approximations on observables derived from them is often\nunpredictable. Therefore, it is challenging to quantify the uncertainty of a\ncomputational result, which, however, is necessary to assess the suitability of\na computational model. Common performance statistics such as the mean absolute\nerror are prone to failure as they do not distinguish the explainable\n(systematic) part of the errors from their unexplainable (random) part. In this\npaper, we discuss problems and solutions for performance assessment of\ncomputational models based on several examples from the quantum chemistry\nliterature. For this purpose, we elucidate the different sources of\nuncertainty, the elimination of systematic errors, and the combination of\nindividual uncertainty components to the uncertainty of a prediction.\n", "  We explore simple Higgs-portal models of dark matter (DM) with spin 1/2, 3/2,\nand 1, respectively, applying to them constraints from the LUX and PandaX-II\ndirect detection experiments and from LHC measurements on the 125-GeV Higgs\nboson. With only one Higgs doublet, we find that the spin-1/2 DM having a\npurely scalar effective coupling to the doublet is viable only in a narrow\nrange of mass near the Higgs pole, whereas the vector DM is still allowed if\nits mass is also close to the Higgs pole or exceeds 1.4 TeV, both in line with\nearlier analyses. Moreover, the spin-3/2 DM is in a roughly similar situation\nto the spin-1/2 DM, but has surviving parameter space which is even more\nrestricted. We also consider the two-Higgs-doublet extension of each of the\npreceding models, assuming that the expanded Yukawa sector is that of the\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model of type II. We show that in these\ntwo-Higgs-doublet-portal models significant portions of the DM mass regions\nexcluded in the simplest scenarios by direct search bounds can be reclaimed due\nto suppression of the effective DM interactions with nucleons at some ratios of\nthe $CP$-even Higgs bosons' couplings to the up and down quarks. The regained\nparameter space contains areas which can yield a DM-nucleon scattering\ncross-section that is far less than its current experimental limit or even goes\nbelow the neutrino-background floor.\n", "  We investigate relaxation in the recently discovered \"fracton\" models and\ndiscover that these models naturally host glassy quantum dynamics in the\nabsence of quenched disorder. We begin with a discussion of \"type I\" fracton\nmodels, in the taxonomy of Vijay, Haah, and Fu. We demonstrate that in these\nsystems, the mobility of charges is suppressed exponentially in the inverse\ntemperature. We further demonstrate that when a zero temperature type I fracton\nmodel is placed in contact with a finite temperature heat bath, the approach to\nequilibrium is a logarithmic function of time over an exponentially wide window\nof time scales. Generalizing to the more complex \"type II\" fracton models, we\nfind that the charges exhibit subdiffusion upto a relaxation time that diverges\nat low temperatures as a super-exponential function of inverse temperature.\nThis behaviour is reminiscent of \"nearly localized\" disordered systems, but\noccurs with a translation invariant three-dimensional Hamiltonian. We also\nconjecture that fracton models with conserved charge may support a phase which\nis a thermal metal but a charge insulator.\n", "  We discuss the effect of dissipation on heating which occurs in periodically\ndriven quantum many body systems. We especially focus on a periodically driven\nBose-Hubbard model coupled to an energy and particle reservoir. Without\ndissipation, this model is known to undergo parametric instabilities which can\nbe considered as an initial stage of heating. By taking the weak on-site\ninteraction limit as well as the weak system-reservoir coupling limit, we find\nthat parametric instabilities are suppressed if the dissipation is stronger\nthan the on-site interaction strength and stable steady states appear. Our\nresults demonstrate that periodically-driven systems can emit energy, which is\nabsorbed from external drivings, to the reservoir so that they can avoid\nheating.\n", "  The PHENIX experiment at BNL-RHIC recently reported the single transverse\nspin asymmetry $A_N$ for forward neutrons measured in polarized proton-nucleus\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200\\,$GeV; $A_N$ in proton-aluminum and\nproton-gold collisions are -0.015 and 0.18, respectively, which are clearly\ndifferent from $A_N=-0.08$ in proton-proton collisions. In this paper, we\npropose large $A_N$ for forward neutrons in ultraperipheral polarized\nproton-nucleus collisions as an explanation of the PHENIX measurements. The\nproposed model is demonstrated using two Monte Carlo simulations organized as\nfollows. In the ultraperipheral collision simulation, we use the STARlight\nevent generator for the simulation of the virtual photon flux and then use the\nMAID2007 unitary isobar model for the simulation of the neutron production in\nthe interactions of a virtual photon with a polarized proton. In the\nproton-nucleus hadronic interaction simulation, the differential cross sections\nof forward neutron production are predicted by a simple one-pion exchange model\nand the Glauber model. The simulated $A_N$ values accumulating the both\ncontribution of ultraperipheral collisions and hadronic interactions are in\ngood agreement with the PHENIX results.\n", "  We report a novel crossover behavior in the long-range-ordered phase of a\nprototypical spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder compound\n$\\mathrm{(C_7H_{10}N)_2CuBr_4}$. The staggered order was previously evidenced\nfrom a continuous and symmetric splitting of $^{14}$N NMR spectral lines on\nlowering temperature below $T_c\\simeq 330$ mK, with a saturation towards\n$\\simeq 150$ mK. Unexpectedly, the split lines begin to further separate away\nbelow $T^*\\sim 100$ mK while the line width and shape remain completely\ninvariable. This crossover behavior is further corroborated by the NMR\nrelaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ measurements. A very strong suppression reflecting\nthe ordering, $T_1^{-1}\\sim T^{5.5}$, observed above $T^*$, is replaced by\n$T_1^{-1}\\sim T$ below $T^*$. These original NMR features are indicative of\nunconventional nature of the crossover, which may arise from a unique\narrangement of the ladders into a spatially anisotropic and frustrated coupling\nnetwork.\n", "  We present a new concept for a multi-stage Zeeman decelerator that is\noptimized particularly for applications in molecular beam scattering\nexperiments. The decelerator consists of a series of alternating hexapoles and\nsolenoids, that effectively decouple the transverse focusing and longitudinal\ndeceleration properties of the decelerator. It can be operated in a\ndeceleration and acceleration mode, as well as in a hybrid mode that makes it\npossible to guide a particle beam through the decelerator at constant speed.\nThe deceleration features phase stability, with a relatively large\nsix-dimensional phase-space acceptance. The separated focusing and deceleration\nelements result in an unequal partitioning of this acceptance between the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions. This is ideal in scattering\nexperiments, which typically benefit from a large longitudinal acceptance\ncombined with narrow transverse distributions. We demonstrate the successful\nexperimental implementation of this concept using a Zeeman decelerator\nconsisting of an array of 25 hexapoles and 24 solenoids. The performance of the\ndecelerator in acceleration, deceleration and guiding modes is characterized\nusing beams of metastable Helium ($^3S$) atoms. Up to 60 % of the kinetic\nenergy was removed for He atoms that have an initial velocity of 520 m/s. The\nhexapoles consist of permanent magnets, whereas the solenoids are produced from\na single hollow copper capillary through which cooling liquid is passed. The\nsolenoid design allows for excellent thermal properties, and enables the use of\nreadily available and cheap electronics components to pulse high currents\nthrough the solenoids. The Zeeman decelerator demonstrated here is mechanically\neasy to build, can be operated with cost-effective electronics, and can run at\nrepetition rates up to 10 Hz\n", "  The coherent control of spin qubits forms the basis of many applications in\nquantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, imaging and spectroscopy.\nSuch control is conventionally achieved by direct driving of the qubit\ntransition with a resonant global field, typically at microwave frequencies.\nHere we introduce an approach that relies on the resonant driving of nearby\nenvironment spins, whose localised magnetic field in turn drives the qubit when\nthe environmental spin Rabi frequency matches the qubit resonance. This concept\nof environmentally mediated resonance (EMR) is explored experimentally using a\nqubit based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond, with nearby\nelectronic spins serving as the environmental mediators. We demonstrate EMR\ndriven coherent control of the NV spin-state, including the observation of Rabi\noscillations, free induction decay, and spin-echo. This technique also provides\na way to probe the nanoscale environment of spin qubits, which we illustrate by\nacquisition of electron spin resonance spectra of single NV centres in various\nsettings.\n", "  Gravitation is described in the context of a dilatonic theory that is\nconformally related to general relativity. All dimensionless ratios of\nfundamental dimensional quantities, e.g. particle masses and the Planck mass,\nas well as the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions, are fixed\nconstants. An interplay between the positive energy density associated with\nrelativistic matter (and possibly with negative spatial curvature) and the\nnegative energy associated with dynamical dilaton phase results in a\nnon-singular, flat cosmological model with no horizon, and -- as a direct\nconsequence of absence of phase transitions in the early universe -- with no\nproduction of topological defects. The (logarithmic) time-derivative of the\nfield modulus is degenerate with the Hubble function, and all cosmological\nepochs of the standard model are unchanged except at the very early universe.\nWe demonstrate that both linear order perturbation theory and the spherical\ncollapse model are equivalent to those in the standard model, up to\nmodifications caused by the phase of the (complex) scalar field and its\nperturbations. Consequently, our alternative theory automatically passes the\nmain classical cosmological tests. Quantum excitations of the phase of the\nscalar field generate a slightly red-tilted spectrum of adiabatic and gaussian\nscalar perturbations on the largest scales. However, this framework does not\nprovide a similar mechanism for producing primordial gravitational waves on\nthese scales. A spherically symmetric vacuum solution that approximately\ndescribes the exterior of gravitationally bound systems (e.g., stars and\ngalaxies) by a modified Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, augmented with an\nadditional linear potential term, could possibly explain galactic rotation\ncurves and strong gravitational lensing with no recourse to dark matter.\n", "  We report a Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) implementation using the\ndissipation signal of a frequency modulation atomic force microscopy that is\ncapable of detecting the gradient of electrostatic force rather than\nelectrostatic force. It features a simple implementation and faster scanning as\nit requires no low frequency modulation. We show that applying a coherent ac\nvoltage with two times the cantilever oscillation frequency induces the\ndissipation signal proportional to the electrostatic force gradient which\ndepends on the effective dc bias voltage including the contact potential\ndifference. We demonstrate the KPFM images of a MoS$_2$ flake taken with the\npresent method is in quantitative agreement with that taken with the frequency\nmodulated Kelvin probe force microscopy technique.\n", "  We study the Casimir-Polder force arising between two identical two-level\natoms and mediated by a massless scalar field propagating in a black-hole\nbackground. We study the interplay of Hawking radiation and Casimir-Polder\nforces and find that, when the atoms are placed near the event horizon, the\nscaling of the Casimir-Polder interaction energy as a function of interatomic\ndistance displays a transition from a thermallike character to a nonthermal\nbehavior. We corroborate our findings for a quantum field prepared in the\nBoulware, Hartle-Hawking, and Unruh vacua. Our analysis is consistent with the\nnonthermal character of the Casimir-Polder interaction of two-level atoms in a\nrelativistic accelerated frame [J. Marino et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 020403\n(2014)], where a crossover from thermal scaling, consistent with the Unruh\neffect, to a nonthermal scaling has been observed. The two crossovers are a\nconsequence of the noninertial character of the background where the field\nmediating the Casimir interaction propagates. While in the former case the\ncharacteristic crossover length scale is proportional to the inverse of the\nsurface gravity of the black hole, in the latter it is determined by the\ninverse of the proper acceleration of the atoms.\n", "  In this paper, we will study the rainbow deformation of the FRW cosmology in\nboth Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We will demonstrate that the\nsingularity in the FRW cosmology can be removed because of the rainbow\ndeformation of the FRW metric. We will obtain the general constraints required\nfor the FRW cosmology to be free from singularities. It will be observed that\nthe inclusion of Gauss-Bonnet gravity can significantly change the constraints\nrequired to obtain a nonsingular universes. We will use a rainbow functions\nmotivated from the hard spectra of gamma-ray bursts to deform the FRW\ncosmology, and it will be explicitly demonstrated that such a deformation\nremoves the singularity in the FRW cosmology.\n", "  Understanding structural controllability of a complex network requires to\nidentify a Minimum Input nodes Set (MIS) of the network. It has been suggested\nthat finding an MIS is equivalent to computing a maximum matching of the\nnetwork, where the unmatched nodes constitute an MIS. However, maximum matching\nof a network is often not unique, and finding all MISs may provide deep\ninsights to the controllability of the network. Finding all possible input\nnodes, which form the union of all MISs, is computationally challenging for\nlarge networks. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for the\nproblem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make it\nefficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. We\nrigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated its\nperformance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental results\nshowed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than the\nexisting method on large real networks.\n", "  We consider a weakly-interacting fermionic gas of alkali-metal atoms\ncharacterized by two hyper- fine states which are Rabi coupled. By using a\nHartree approximation for the repulsive interaction we determine the\nzero-temperature equation of state of this Fermi gas in D spatial dimensions (D\n= 1, 2, 3). Then, adopting the Landau-Vlasov equation and hydrodynamic\nequations, we investi- gate the speed of first sound and zero sound. We show\nthat the two sounds, which occur respectively in collisional and collisionless\nregimes, crucially depend on the interplay between interaction strength and\nRabi coupling. Finally, we discuss for some experimentally relevant cases the\neffect of a trapping harmonic potential on the density profiles of the\nfermionic system.\n", "  Gauge symmetries are known to be respected by gravity because gauge charges\ncarry flux lines, but global charges do not carry flux lines and are not\nconserved by gravitational interaction. For discrete symmetries, they are\nspontaneously broken in the Universe, forming domain walls. Since the\nrealization of discrete symmetries in the Universe must involve the vacuum\nexpectation values of Higgs fields, a string-like configuration (hair) at the\nintersection of domain walls in the Higgs vacua can be realized. Therefore, we\nargue that discrete charges are also respected by gravity.\n", "  We study the dynamic response of a superfluid field to a moving edge\ndislocation line to which the field is minimally coupled. We use a dissipative\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, and determine the initial conditions by solving the\nequilibrium version of the model. We consider the subsequent time evolution of\nthe field for both glide and climb dislocation motion and analyze the results\nfor a range of values of the constant speed $V_D$ of the moving dislocation. We\nfind that the type of motion of the dislocation line is very important in\ndetermining the time evolution of the superfluid field distribution associated\nwith it. Climb motion of the dislocation line induces increasing asymmetry, as\nfunction of time, in the field profile, with part of the probability being, as\nit were, left behind. On the other hand, glide motion has no effect on the\nsymmetry properties of the superfluid field distribution. Damping of the\nsuperfluid field due to excitations associated with the moving dislocation line\noccurs in both cases.\n", "  It has been shown [Phys. Rev. E 84, 022101 (2011); Chaos 22, 023123 (2012)]\nthat earthquakes of magnitude $M$ greater or equal to 7 are globally\ncorrelated. Such correlations were identified by studying the variance\n$\\kappa_1$ of natural time which has been proposed as an order parameter for\nseismicity. Here, we study the fluctuations of this order parameter using the\nGlobal Centroid Moment Tensor catalog for a magnitude threshold $M_{thres}=5.0$\nand focus on its behavior before major earthquakes. Natural time analysis\nreveals that distinct minima of the fluctuations of the order parameter of\nseismicity appear {within} almost five and a half months{-on average-} before\nall major earthquakes of magnitude larger than 8.4. This phenomenon\ncorroborates the finding [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 13734 (2013)] that\nsimilar minima of the seismicity order parameter fluctuations had preceded all\nmajor shallow earthquakes in Japan. Moreover, on the basis of these minima a\nstatistically significant binary prediction method for earthquakes of magnitude\nlarger than 8.4 with hit rate 100\\% and false alarm rate 6.67\\% is suggested.\n", "  The LHCb discovery of the two baryonic states $P_c^+(4380)$ and\n$P_c^+(4450)$, having $J^{P}=3/2^-$ and $J^{P}=5/2^+$, respectively, in the\nprocess $pp \\to b \\bar{b} \\to \\Lambda_b X$, followed by the decay $\\Lambda_b\n\\to J/\\psi\\; p\\; K^-$, has motivated a number of theoretical models.\nInterpreting them as compact $\\{\\bar{c}\\; [c u] \\; [ud]; L_{\\mathcal{P}}=0,1\\}$\nobjects, the mass spectroscopy of the $J^P=3/2^-$ and $J^P=5/2^+$ pentaquarks\nwas worked out by us for the pentaquarks in the $SU(3)_F$ multiplets, using an\neffective Hamiltonian based on constituent diquarks and quarks. Their possible\ndiscovery modes in $b$-baryon decays were also given using the heavy quark spin\nsymmetry. In this paper, we calculate the mass spectrum of the hidden\n$c\\bar{c}$ pentaquarks having $J^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}^\\pm$ for the $SU(3)_F$\nmultiplets and their anticipated discovery modes in $b$-baryon decays.

Here we investigate\nthe role of supernova (SN) explosions occurring in massive binary systems lying\nin a disc-like structure within the innermost parsec. We use a regularized\nalgorithm to simulate 30,000 isolated three-body systems composed of a stellar\nbinary orbiting the SMBH. We start the integration when the primary member\nundergoes a SN explosion, and we analyze the impact of SN kicks on the orbits\nof stars and compact remnants. We find that SN explosions scatter the lighter\nstars in the pair on completely different orbits, with higher eccentricity and\ninclination. In contrast, stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and massive stars\nretain memory of the orbit of their progenitor star. Our results suggest that\nSN kicks are not sufficient to eject BHs from the GC. We thus predict that all\nBHs that form in situ in the central parsec of our Galaxy remain in the GC,\nbuilding up a cluster of dark remnants. In addition, the change of NS orbits\ninduced by SNe may partially account for the observed dearth of NSs in the GC.\nAbout 40 per cent of remnants stay bound to the stellar companion after the\nkick; we expect up to 70 per cent of them might become X-ray binaries through\nRoche-lobe filling. Finally, the eccentricity of some light stars becomes > 0.7\nas an effect of the SN kick, producing orbits similar to those of the G1 and G2\ndusty objects.\n", "  Protein-ligand binding is essential to almost all life processes. The\nunderstanding of protein-ligand interactions is fundamentally important to\nrational drug design and protein design. Based on large scale data sets, we\nshow that protein rigidity strengthening or flexibility reduction is a pivoting\nmechanism in protein-ligand binding. Our approach based solely on rigidity is\nable to unveil a surprisingly long range contribution of four residue layers to\nprotein-ligand binding, which has a ramification for drug and protein design.\nAdditionally, the present work reveals that among various pairwise\ninteractions, the short range ones within the distance of the van der Waals\ndiameter are most important. It is found that the present approach outperforms\nall the other state-of-the-art scoring functions for protein-ligand binding\naffinity predictions of two benchmark data sets\n", "  A computational framework integrating optimization algorithms, parallel\ncomputing and plant physiology was developed to explore crop ideotype design.\nThe backbone of the framework is a plant physiology model that accurately\ntracks water use (i.e. a plant hydraulic model) coupled with mass transport\n(CO2 exchange and transport), energy conversion (leaf temperature due to\nradiation, convection and mass transfer) and photosynthetic biochemistry of an\nadult maize plant. For a given trait configuration, soil parameters and hourly\nweather data, the model computes water use and photosynthetic output over the\nlife of an adult maize plant. We coupled this validated model with a parallel,\nmeta-heuristic optimization algorithm, specifically a genetic algorithm (GA),\nto identify trait sets (ideotypes) that resulted in desired water use behavior\nof the adult maize plant. We detail features of the model as well as the\nimplementation details of the coupling with the optimization framework and\ndeployment on high performance computing platforms. We illustrate a\nrepresentative result of this framework by identifying maize ideotypes with\noptimized photosynthetic yields using weather and soil conditions corresponding\nto Davis, CA. Finally, we show how the framework can be used to identify broad\nideotype trends that can inform breeding efforts.

According to the\ntradeoff between the radiative rate enhancement and quantum efficiency (QE)\nconditional optimization was performed to ensure ~2-3-4 and 5-fold apparent cQE\nenhancement of SiV color centers with ~10% intrinsic QE. The enhancement\nspectra, as well as the near-field and charge distribution were inspected to\nuncover the physics underlying behind the optical responses. The conditionally\noptimized coupled systems were qualified by the product of the radiative rate\nenhancements at the excitation and emission, which is nominated as Px factor.\nThe optimized spherical core-shell nanoresonator containing a centralized\nemitter is capable of enhancing considerably the emission via bonding dipolar\nresonance. The Px factor is 529-fold with 49.7% cQE at the emission.\nDecentralization of the emitter leads to appearance of higher order multipolar\nmodes, which is not advantageous caused by their nonradiative nature.\nTransversal and longitudinal dipolar resonances of the optimized ellipsoidal\ncore-shell resonator were tuned to the excitation and emission, respectively.\nThe simultaneous enhancements result in 6.2x10^5 Px factor with 50.6% cQE at\nthe emission. Rod-shaped concave core-shell nanoresonators exploit similarly\ntransversal and longitudinal dipolar resonances, moreover they enhance the\nfluorescence more significantly due to their antenna-like geometry. Px factor\nof 8.34x10^5 enhancement is achievable while the cQE is 50.3% at the emission.\nThe enhancement can result in 2.03x10^6-fold Px factor, when the criterion\nregarding the minimum QE is set to 20%.\n", "  An algebro-operator approach, called shape invariant potential method, of\nconstructing generalized coherent states for photon-added particle system is\npresented.

The model includes local awareness due to contacts\nwith aware individuals, as well as global awareness due to reported cases of\ninfection and awareness campaigns. We investigate the effects of time delay in\nresponse of unaware individuals to available information on the epidemic\ndynamics by establishing conditions for the Hopf bifurcation of the endemic\nsteady state of the model. Analytical results are supported by numerical\nbifurcation analysis and simulations.\n", "  We report an investigation of data analysis methods derived from other\ndisciplines, which we applied to physics software systems. They concern the\nanalysis of inequality, trend analysis and the analysis of diversity. The\nanalysis of inequality exploits statistical methods originating from\neconometrics; trend analysis is typical of economics and environmental\nsciences; the analysis of diversity is based on concepts derived from ecology\nand treats software as an ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, this is an\ninnovative exploration, as we could not find track of previous use of these\nmethods in the experimental physics domains within the scope of the IEEE\nNuclear Science Symposium. We applied these methods in the context of Geant4\nphysics validation and Geant4 maintainability assessment.\n", "  Seven data sources are analyzed and combined to form a surface wind speed\nclimatology for the Gulf of California.\n", "  Collective cell migration is a highly regulated process involved in wound\nhealing, cancer metastasis and morphogenesis. Mechanical interactions among\ncells provide an important regulatory mechanism to coordinate such collective\nmotion. Using a Self-Propelled Voronoi (SPV) model that links cell mechanics to\ncell shape and cell motility, we formulate a generalized mechanical inference\nmethod to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution of cellular stresses from\nmeasured traction forces in motile tissues and show that such traction-based\nstresses match those calculated from instantaneous cell shapes. We additionally\nuse stress information to characterize the rheological properties of the\ntissue. We identify a motility-induced swim stress that adds to the interaction\nstress to determine the global contractility or extensibility of epithelia. We\nfurther show that the temporal correlation of the interaction shear stress\ndetermines an effective viscosity of the tissue that diverges at the\nliquid-solid transition, suggesting the possibility of extracting rheological\ninformation directly from traction data.\n", "  In this paper, we give a modified version of the qutrit ZX-calculus, by which\nwe represent qutrit graph states as diagrams and prove that the qutrit version\nof local complementation property is true if and only if the qutrit Hadamard\ngate $H$ has an Euler decomposition into $4\\pi/3$-green and red rotations. This\npaves the way for studying the completeness of qutrit ZX-calculus for qutrit\nstabilizer quantum mechanics.\n", "  Fast carrier cooling is important for high power graphene based devices.\nStrongly Coupled Optical Phonons (SCOPs) play a major role in the relaxation of\nphotoexcited carriers in graphene. Heterostructures of graphene and hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN) have shown exceptional mobility and high saturation\ncurrent, which makes them ideal for applications, but the effect of the hBN\nsubstrate on carrier cooling mechanisms is not understood. We track the cooling\nof hot photo-excited carriers in graphene-hBN heterostructures using ultrafast\npump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the carriers cool down four times faster\nin the case of graphene on hBN than on a silicon oxide substrate thus\novercoming the hot phonon (HP) bottleneck that plagues cooling in graphene\ndevices.\n", "  The statistical properties of a radiation sources are commonly characterized\nby second-order-correlation or Mandel parameter. Our research found that the\nsingle photons modulation spectrum provides us another optional way which is\nmore sensitive to the high frequency information contained in the photon\nsequence. In this paper, we present direct laser communication by using a\nmulti-channel frequency coding scheme based on the single photons modulation\nspectrum in which the multi-frequency modulation makes the transmission\ncapacity efficiently enhanced. The modulation frequencies could be operated in\na wide band without frequency aliasing due to the inherent randomness of\nphotons arrival time of weak coherent light. The error rate less than 10-5 has\nbeen achieved experimentally when the mean signal photon count is 80 kcps. The\nmodulated coherent light field shows nonlinear effects of single photons\nmodulation spectrum. The studies of statistical properties of the single\nphotons modulation spectrum, including the dependence of mean noise photon\ncount, integration time, channel spacing and the number of frequency component,\nhelped us to optimize the error rate and transmission capacity.\n", "  Neutron stars are observed to undergo small, abrupt rotational speed-up. This\nphenomenon is known as glitch. In pulsar timing observations, detection of a\nneutron star glitch is constrained by the time of occurrence of the event\nrelative to entire observing span and observing cadences, time of occurrence of\npreceding/subsequent glitches relative to observing cadences and the strength\nof timing noise. Using the Yu et al. (2013) data sets, in this paper, we\nanalyse the observational selection in terms of detection probability. We\ndefine partial probabilities for the constraints and use Monte Carlo method\nwith assuming glitches distribute uniformly to solve the complete probability\nformula for both group case involving 157 pulsars and individual cases for each\nof the seven pulsars with glitch numbers $\\geqslant 5$. In the simulations,\nnumerical Bayesian inference is used for glitch identification. With the\nderived detection probability density and observed results, we uncover glitch\nsize probability distribution embedded in the data for both the group and\nindividual cases. We find the most prominent correction occurred for\nPSR~J1341$-$6220, in which exponent of the power-law model varies from the\nobserved $+0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$ to $-0.4^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$. We suggest observers\ndetermine the detection probability for glitch theories, e.g. the\nself-organised criticality.\n", "  We investigated current-induced effective magnetic field Heff in\nhalf-metallic oxide La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) films with various thicknesses by\nusing the planar Hall effect. Applying in-plane current to the LSMO films\nexerted an in-plane Heff orthogonal to the current direction on magnetization.\nThe Heff magnitude increased with increasing current magnitude, and the\ndirection reversed when the applied current switched to opposite sign. Assuming\nthat a 6.5-u.c. insulating layer is created in the LSMO, the values of Heff\nobserved in devices with three different LSMO thicknesses were almost scaled\nwith current density, evaluated from the effective LSMO thickness excluding the\ninsulating layer, suggesting that Heff is induced in the LSMO bulk.\n", "  The Green's function contains much information about physical systems.\nMathematically, the fractional moment method (FMM) developed by Aizenman and\nMolchanov connects the Green's function and the transport of electrons in the\nAnderson model. Recently, it has been discovered that the Green's function on a\ngraph can be represented using self-avoiding walks on a graph, which allows us\nto connect localization properties in the system and graph properties. We\ndiscuss FMM in terms of the self-avoiding walks on a general graph, the only\ngeneral condition being that the graph has a uniform bound on the vertex\ndegree.\n", "  We formulate multiple Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLEs) for coset\nWess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models. The resultant SLEs may describe the critical\nbehavior of multiple interfaces for the 2D statistical mechanics models whose\ncritical properties are classified by coset WZW models. The SLEs are\nessentially characterized by multiple Brownian motions on a Lie group manifold\nas well as those on the real axis. The drift terms of the Brownian motions,\nwhich come from interactions of interfaces, are explicitly determined by\nimposing a martingale condition on correlation functions among boundary\ncondition changing operators. As a concrete example, we formulate multiple SLE\non the $Z(n)$ parafermion model and calculate the crossing probability which is\nclosely related to 3-SLE drift terms.\n", "  The combination of single photon emitters (quantum dots) and tailored metal\nnanoparticles with defined size and shape allows a detailed study of the\ninteraction between light and matter. The enhanced optical near-field of the\nnanoparticles can strongly influence the absorption and emission of nearby\nfluorescent quantum dots. We show that a controlled spatial arrangement enables\nthe analysis and understanding of polarization dependent coupling between a\nmetal nanoparticle and few or single fluorescent quantum dots. Modifications in\nthe fluorescence spectrum and lifetime are analyzed and compare well with\nsimulations.\n", "  We examine the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE) in a graphene-substrate system\nwith the presence of external magnetic field. In the quantum Hall regime, we\ndemonstrate that the in-plane and transverse spin-dependent splittings in\nphotonic SHE exhibit different quantized behaviors. The quantized SHE can be\ndescribed as a consequence of a quantized geometric phase (Berry phase), which\ncorresponds to the quantized spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, an\nexperimental scheme based on quantum weak value amplification is proposed to\ndetect the quantized SHE in terahertz frequency regime. By incorporating the\nquantum weak measurement techniques, the quantized photonic SHE holds great\npromise for detecting quantized Hall conductivity and Berry phase. These\nresults may bridge the gap between the electronic SHE and photonic SHE in\ngraphene.\n", "  Detection of the copious amount of X-ray emission from the dilute hot plasma\nin galaxy clusters suggests that a substantial fraction of the central\nintracluster medium (ICM) is cooling radiatively on a time scale much faster\nthan the Hubble time. Theoretical models predict the cooling rate as high as\nabout few hundred to few thousand solar mass per year, which would be then made\navailable for the formation of new stars in the core of these clusters.\nHowever, systematic studies of the cores of such clusters failed to detect the\nexpected reservoirs of cooled gas. Thus, the gas in the cores of galaxy\nclusters is losing substantial amount of energy in the form of X-rays but is\nnot cooling. This in turn point towards the famous cooling flow paradox and\nhence demands some intermittent heating to balance the cooling over such a long\nperiod. Several sources have been suggested to counteract on the cooling of the\nICM, however, the AGN feedback appeared to be the most promising and enough\nenergetic source to resist cooling of the ICM in the cores of such clusters. In\nthis presentation I will provide a brief overview on the feedback processes\nthat are involved in the cores of the galaxy clusters with an emphasis on the\nAGN feedback and its observable signatures.\n", "  In this letter, a methodology is proposed to improve the scattering powers\nobtained from model-based decomposition using Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture\nRadar (PolSAR) data. The novelty of this approach lies in utilizing the\nintrinsic information in the off-diagonal elements of the 3$\\times$3 coherency\nmatrix $\\mathbf{T}$ represented in the form of complex correlation\ncoefficients. Two complex correlation coefficients are computed between\nco-polarization and cross-polarization components of the Pauli scattering\nvector. The difference between modulus of complex correlation coefficients\ncorresponding to $\\mathbf{T}^{\\mathrm{opt}}$ (i.e. the degree of polarization\n(DOP) optimized coherency matrix), and $\\mathbf{T}$ (original) matrices is\nobtained. Then a suitable scaling is performed using fractions \\emph{i.e.,}\n$(T_{ii}^{\\mathrm{opt}}/\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{3}T_{ii}^{\\mathrm{opt}})$ obtained\nfrom the diagonal elements of the $\\mathbf{T}^{\\mathrm{opt}}$ matrix.\nThereafter, these new quantities are used in modifying the Yamaguchi\n4-component scattering powers obtained from $\\mathbf{T}^{\\mathrm{opt}}$. To\ncorroborate the fact that these quantities have physical relevance, a\nquantitative analysis of these for the L-band AIRSAR San Francisco and the\nL-band Kyoto images is illustrated. Finally, the scattering powers obtained\nfrom the proposed methodology are compared with the corresponding powers\nobtained from the Yamaguchi \\emph{et. al.,} 4-component (Y4O) decomposition and\nthe Yamaguchi \\emph{et. al.,} 4-component Rotated (Y4R) decomposition for the\nsame data sets. The proportion of negative power pixels is also computed. The\nresults show an improvement on all these attributes by using the proposed\nmethodology.\n", "  There is growing observational evidence of dust coagulation in the dense\nfilaments within molecular clouds. Infrared observations show that the dust\ngrains size distribution gets shallower and the relative fraction of small to\nlarge dust grains decreases as the local density increases. Ultraviolet (UV)\nobservations show that the strength of the 2175 {\\AA} feature, the so-called UV\nbump, also decreases with cloud density. In this work, we apply the technique\ndeveloped for the Taurus study to the Orion molecular cloud and confirm that\nthe UV bump decreases over the densest cores of the cloud as well as in the\nheavily UV irradiated {\\lambda} Orionis shell. The study has been extended to\nthe Rosette cloud with uncertain results given the distance (1.3 kpc).\n", "  We investigate the outcome of collisions in very different mass regimes, but\nan otherwise identical parameter setup, comprising the impact velocity\n($v/v_\\mathrm{esc}$), impact angle, mass ratio, and initial composition, w.r.t.\nsimple hydrodynamic scaling. The colliding bodies' masses range from $\\simeq\n10^{16}$ to $10^{24}$ kg, which includes km-sized planetesimals up to\nplanetary-sized objects. Our analysis of the results comprises the time\nevolution of fragment masses, the fragments' water contents and fragment\ndynamics, where we start with bodies consisting of basalt and water ice. The\nusual assumption of hydrodynamic scaling over a wider range of masses is based\non material behavior similar to a fluid, or a rubble pile, respectively. All\nour simulations are carried out once including full solid-body physics, and\nonce for strengthless - but otherwise identical - bodies, to test for the\ninfluence of material strength.\n  We find that scale-invariance over a wider range of masses is mostly only a\nvery crude approximation at best, but can be applied to constrained mass ranges\nif tested carefully. For the chosen scenarios the outcomes of solid-body\nobjects compared to strengthless fluid bodies differ most for our intermediate\nmasses, but are similar for the lowest and highest masses. The most energetic,\nplanet-sized collisions produce considerably faster and more fragments, which\nis also reflected in high water losses - above 50 percent in a single\ncollision.\n", "  We discuss the notions of mutual information and conditional information for\nnoncomposite systems, classical and quantum; both the mutual information and\nthe conditional information are associated with the presence of hidden\ncorrelations in the state of a single qudit. We consider analogs of the\nentanglement phenomena in the systems without subsystems related to strong\nhidden quantum correlations.\n", "  We study the properties of a soliton crystal, an bound state of several\noptical pulses that propagate with a fixed temporal separation through the\noptical fibres of the proposed approach for generation of optical frequency\ncombs (OFC) for astronomical spectrograph calibration. This approach - also\nbeing suitable for subpicosecond pulse generation for other applications -\nconsists of a conventional single-mode fibre and a suitably pumped Erbium-doped\nfibre. Two continuous-wave lasers are used as light source. The soliton crystal\narises out of the initial deeply modulated laser field at low input powers; for\nhigher input powers, it dissolves into free solitons. We study the soliton\ncrystal build-up in the first fibre stage with respect to different fibre\nparameters (group-velocity dispersion, nonlinearity, and optical losses) and to\nthe light source characteristics (laser frequency separation and intensity\ndifference). We show that the soliton crystal can be described by two\nquantities, its fundamental frequency and the laser power-threshold at which\nthe crystal dissolves into free solitons. The soliton crystal exhibits features\nof a linear and nonlinear optical pattern at the same time and is insensitive\nto the initial laser power fluctuations. We perform our studies using the\nnumerical technique called Soliton Radiation Beat Analysis.\n", "  In this paper, we study thermodynamics of the cluster of galaxies under the\neffect of dynamical dark energy. We evaluate the configurational integral for\ninteracting system of galaxies in an expanding universe by including the\neffects produced by the varying $\\Lambda$. The gravitational partition function\nis obtained using this configuration integral. We obtain thermodynamics\nquantities in canonical ensemble which depend on time and investigate the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. We also calculate the distribution function in\ngrand canonical ensemble. The time evolution of the clustering parameter of\ngalaxies is investigated for the time dependent (dynamical) dark energy. We\nconclude that the second law of thermodynamics is valid for the total system of\ncluster of galaxies and dynamical dark energy. We calculate correlation\nfunction and show that our model is very close to Peebles's power law, in\nagreement with the N-body simulation. It is observed that thermodynamics\nquantities depend on the modified clustering parameter for this system of\ngalaxies.\n", "  Extensive air showers still are our only access to the highest-energy\nparticles in the universe, namely cosmic-ray nuclei with energies up to several\n100 EeV. Studying open questions in cosmic-ray physics, like their yet unknown\norigin requires the reconstruction of the energy and mass of the primary\nparticles from the air-shower measurements. Great progress has been achieved\nlately in the development of the radio detection technique for this purpose.\nThere now is a consistent picture of the mechanisms behind the radio emission,\nwhich is in agreement with measurements. Several second-generation, digital\nantenna arrays are operating in different parts of the world not only aiming at\nthe further development of the technique, but also contributing to cosmic-ray\nphysics at energies above 100 PeV. Recently it has been demonstrated\nexperimentally that radio detection can compete in precision with established\ntechniques for air showers, like the measurement of secondary particles on\nground, or fluorescence and Cherenkov light emitted by air showers.\nConsequently, cosmic-ray observatories can benefit from radio extensions to\nmaximize their total measurement accuracy.\n", "  We consider Dirac operators defined on planar domains. For a large class of\nboundary conditions, we give a direct proof of their self-adjointness in the\nSobolev space $H^1$.\n", "  Optical surface waves, highly localized modes bound to the surface of media,\nenable manipulation of light at nanoscale, thus impacting a wide range of areas\nin nanoscience. By applying metamaterials, artificially designed optical\nmaterials, as contacting media at the interface, we can significantly\nameliorate surface wave propagation and even generate new types of waves. Here,\nwe demonstrate that high aspect ratio (1:20) grating structures with plasmonic\nlamellas in deep nanoscale trenches function as a versatile platform supporting\nboth surface and volume infrared waves. The surface waves exhibit a unique\ncombination of properties, such as directionality, broadband existence (from 4\n{\\mu}m to at least 14 {\\mu}m and beyond) and high localization, making them an\nattractive tool for effective control of light in an extended range of infrared\nfrequencies.\n", "  Recently a new formulation of quantum mechanics has been suggested which is\nbased on the concept of signed particles, that is, classical objects provided\nwith a position, a momentum and a sign simultaneously. In this paper, we\ncomment on the plausibility of simulating atomic systems beyond the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation by means of the signed particle formulation of\nquantum mechanics. First, in order to show the new perspective offered by this\nnew formalism, we provide an example studying quantum tunnelling through a\nsimple Gaussian barrier in terms of the signed particle formulation. Then, we\nperform a direct simulation of the hydrogen atom as a full quantum two-body\nsystem, showing that the formalism can be a very promising tool for\nfirst-principle-only quantum chemistry.\n", "  A century after its conception, quantum mechanics still hold surprises that\ncontradict many \"common sense\" notions. The contradiction is especially sharp\nin case one consider trajectories of truly quantum objects such as single\nphotons. From a classical point of view, trajectories are well defined for\nparticles, but not for waves. The wave-particle duality forces a breakdown of\nthis dichotomy and quantum mechanics resolves this in a remarkable way:\nTrajectories can be well defined, but they are utterly different from classical\ntrajectories. Here, we give an operational definition to the trajectory of a\nsingle photon by introducing a novel technique to mark its path using its\nspectral composition. The method demonstrates that the frequency degree of\nfreedom can be used as a bona fide quantum measurement device (meter). The\nanalysis of a number of setups, using our operational definition, leads to\nanomalous trajectories which are non-continuous and in some cases do not even\nconnect the source of the photon to where it is detected. We carried out an\nexperimental demonstration of these anomalous trajectories using a nested\ninterferometer. We show that the Two-state vector formalism provides a simple\nexplanation for the results.\n", "  A future compact and modular X and gamma-ray spectrometer (XGS) has been\ndesigned and a series of prototypes have been developed and tested. The\nexperiment envisages the use of CsI scintillator bars read out at both ends by\nsingle-cell 25 mm2 Silicon Drift Detectors. Digital algorithms are used to\ndiscriminate between events absorbed in the Silicon layer (lower energy X rays)\nand events absorbed in the scintillator crystal (higher energy X rays and\ngamma-rays). The prototype characterization is shown and the modular design for\nfuture experiments with possible astrophysical applications (e.g. for the\nTHESEUS mission proposed for the ESA M5 call) are discussed.\n", "  The paper \"On the theory of storm\" (Zur Sturmtheorie) is the last one Max\nMargules has published in 1906, just before to \"bid farewell to Meteorology\"\n(using his words). The lack of English translation of this paper might be\nfilled by this attempt which can be certainly improved, however.\n", "  Transformations to create more sustainable social-ecological systems are\nurgently needed. Structural change is a feature of transformations of\nsocial-ecological systems that is of critical importance but is little\nunderstood. Here, we propose a framework for conceptualising and modelling\nsustainability transformations based on adaptive networks. Adaptive networks\nfocus attention on the interplay between the structure of a social-ecological\nsystem and the dynamics of individual entities. Adaptive networks could\nprogress transformations research by: 1) focusing research on changes in\nstructure; 2) providing a conceptual framework that clarifies the temporal\ndynamics of social-ecological transformations compared to the most commonly\nused heuristic in resilience studies, the ball-and-cup diagram; 3) providing\nquantitative modelling tools in an area of study dominated by qualitative\nmethods. We illustrate the potential application of adaptive networks to\nsocial-ecological transformations using a case study of illegal fishing in the\nSouthern Ocean and a theoretical model of socially networked resource users.\n", "  We analyse theoretically the possibilities of contactless control of in-gap\nstates formed by a pair of electrons confined in a triangular quantum ring. The\nin-gap states are corner-localized states associated with two electrons\noccupying the same corner area, and thus shifted to much higher energies than\nother corner states, but still they are below the energies of\ncorner-side-localized states. We show how the energies, degeneracy and\nsplittings between consecutive levels change with the orientation of an\nexternal electric field relatively to the polygonal cross section. We also show\nhow absorption changes in the presence of external electric and magnetic\nfields.\n", "  We introduce a method to evaluate the relative populations of different\nconformers of molecular species in solution, aiming at quantum mechanical\naccuracy, while keeping the computational cost at a nearly molecular-mechanics\nlevel. This goal is achieved by combining long classical molecular-dynamics\nsimulations to sample the free-energy landscape of the system, advanced\nclustering techniques to identify the most relevant conformers, and\nthermodynamic perturbation theory to correct the resulting populations, using\nquantum-mechanical energies from density-functional theory. A quantitative\ncriterion for assessing the accuracy thus achieved is proposed. The resulting\nmethodology is demonstrated in the specific case of cyanin\n(cyanidin-3-glucoside) in water solution.\n", "  One of the most compelling problems in science consists in understanding how\nliving systems process information. After all, the way they process information\ndefines their capacities to learning and adaptation. There is an increasing\nconsensus in that living systems are not machines in any sense. Biological\nhyper-computation is the concept coined that expresses that living beings\nprocess information non-algorithmically. Maldonado and Gomez (2015) have\nbrought up biological hyper-computation as a new problem within complexity\nscience. This paper aims at proving a positive understanding of non-algorithmic\nprocesses. A number of arguments are brought that support the claim. This\nfosters, it is argued, a brand new understanding of information processing\namong living beings. Some conclusions are drawn at the end.\n", "  We report point contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) measurements on a\nhigh-quality single crystal of the non-centrosymmetric superconductor Re6Zr. We\nobserve that the PCAR spectra can be fitted by taking two isotropic\nsuperconducting gaps with Delta_1 ~ 0.79 meV and Delta_2 ~ 0.22 meV\nrespectively, suggesting that there are at least two bands which contribute to\nsuperconductivity. Combined with the observation of time reversal symmetry\nbreaking at the superconducting transition from muon spin relaxation\nmeasurements (Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 107002 (2014)), our results imply an\nunconventional superconducting order in this compound: A multiband singlet\nstate that breaks time reversal symmetry or a triplet state dominated by\ninterband pairing.\n", "  The proof of the Luttinger theorem, which was originally given for a normal\nFermi liquid with equal spin populations formally described by the exact\nmany-body theory at zero temperature, is here extended to an approximate theory\ngiven in terms of a \"conserving\" approximation also with spin imbalanced\npopulations. The need for this extended proof, whose underlying assumptions are\nhere spelled out in detail, stems from the recent interest in superfluid\ntrapped Fermi atoms with attractive inter-particle interaction, for which the\ndifference between two spin populations can be made large enough that\nsuperfluidity is destroyed and the system remains normal even at zero\ntemperature. In this context, we will demonstrate the validity of the Luttinger\ntheorem separately for the two spin populations for any \"$\\Phi$-derivable\"\napproximation, and illustrate it in particular for the self-consistent\n$t$-matrix approximation.\n", "  Grids allow users flexible on-demand usage of computing resources through\nremote communication networks. A remarkable example of a Grid in High Energy\nPhysics (HEP) research is used in the ALICE experiment at European Organization\nfor Nuclear Research CERN. Physicists can submit jobs used to process the huge\namount of particle collision data produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nGrids face complex security challenges. They are interesting targets for\nattackers seeking for huge computational resources. Since users can execute\narbitrary code in the worker nodes on the Grid sites, special care should be\nput in this environment. Automatic tools to harden and monitor this scenario\nare required. Currently, there is no integrated solution for such requirement.\nThis paper describes a new security framework to allow execution of job\npayloads in a sandboxed context. It also allows process behavior monitoring to\ndetect intrusions, even when new attack methods or zero day vulnerabilities are\nexploited, by a Machine Learning approach. We plan to implement the proposed\nframework as a software prototype that will be tested as a component of the\nALICE Grid middleware.\n", "  Reflection Nebula NGC2023 shows specific interstellar infrared spectrum due\nto polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in a wide wavelength range from 5 to\n20 micrometer. By our previous quantum chemistry calculation, it was suggested\nthat a molecule group having hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon combined skeleton\ncould reproduce ubiquitous interstellar infrared spectrum. In this paper,\nobserved NGC2023 spectrum was compared in detail with such carrier candidates.\nFirst model molecule was di-cation (C23H12)2+ with two hydrocarbon pentagons\ncombined with five hexagons. Observed strong infrared bands were 6.2, 7.7, 8.6,\nand 11.2 micrometer. Whereas, calculated strong peaks were 6.4, 7.5, 7.7, 8.5,\nand 11.2 micrometer. Observed weaker bands from 10 to 15 micrometer were 11.0,\n12.0, 12.7, 13.5, and 14.2 micrometer, which were reproduced well by computed\nbands as 10.9, 12.0, 12.6, 13.6, and 14.0 micrometer. From 15 to 20 micrometer,\nobserved 15.8, 16.4, 17.4, 17.8, and 19.0 micrometer were correlated with\ncalculated 15.6, 16.5, 17.2, 18.2, and 18.8 micrometer. It should be noted that\nwe could successfully reproduce interstellar infrared spectrum by applying a\nsingle molecule. Second model molecule was (C12H8)3+ with one pentagon combined\nwith two hexagons. Again, observed strong bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2 and 12.7\nmicrometer were successfully computed as 6.3, 7.4, 7.7, 8.6, 11.1, and 12.8\nmicrometer. It was concluded that by introducing hydrocarbon pentagon-hexagon\ncombined ionized molecules, interstellar PAH oriented infrared spectrum could\nbe successfully reproduced.\n", "  Artificially synthesized Janus particles have tremendous prospective as\nin-vivo drug-delivery agents due to the possibility of self-propulsion by\nexternal stimuli. Here we report the first ever computational study of\ntranslational and rotational motion of self-propelled Janus tracers in a het-\nerogeneous polymeric environment. The presence of polymers makes the\ntranslational mean square displacement (MSD) of the Janus tracer to grow very\nslowly as compared to that of a free Janus tracer, but surprisingly the mean\nsquare angular displacement (MSAD) is significantly increased as observed in a\nrecent experiment. Moreover, with the increasing propulsion velocity, MSAD\ngrows even faster. However, when the repulsive polymers are replaced with\npolymers with sticky zones, MSD and MSAD both show sharp decline.\n", "  Vacuum induced coherence in a strongly coupled cavity consisting of a\nthree-level system is studied theoretically. The effects of the strong coupling\nto electromagnetic field vacuum are examined by solution of an open-system\nquantum master equation. The numerical results show that the system exhibits\npopulation trapping, and the numerical results are interpreted with analytical\nexpressions derived from a new basis in the weak excitation regime. We further\nshow that the generated effects can be probed with weak external fields.\nMoreover, it is shown that the induced coherence can be controlled by the\napplied field parameters like field detuning. Finally, we study the trapping\ndynamics in the strong field excitation regime, and also demonstrate that a\nrecently proposed asymmetric pumping regime (limited to the weak coupling\nregime) can remove the radiative decay of coherent Rabi oscillations, with both\nweak and strong excitation fields.\n"]}
