Both partners exhibit a permanent quadrupole moment, so that\ntheir mutual quadrupole-quadrupole long-range interaction is attractive enough\nto bind trimers. Numerical results are given for an excited Cs(6P) atom and a\nground state Cs2 molecule. The prospects for achieving photoassociation of a\ncold atom/dimer pair is thus discussed and found promising. The formalism can\nbe easily generalized to the long-range interaction between molecules to\ninvestigate the formation of cold tetramers.\n", "  In this work we apply the formalism developed in [M. Lepers \\emph{et al}.,\nPhys. Rev. A \\textbf{77}, 043628 (2008)] to different initial conditions\ncorresponding to systems usually met in real-life experiments, and calculate\nthe observable quantities that can be used to characterize the dynamics of the\nsystem. The position space point of view allows highly intuitive pictures of\nthe physics at play.\n", "  The electrostatic interaction between an excited atom and a diatomic ground\nstate molecule in an arbitrary rovibrational level at large mutual separations\nis investigated with a general second-order perturbation theory, in the\nperspective of modeling the photoassociation between cold atoms and molecules.\nWe find that the combination of quadrupole-quadrupole and van der Waals\ninteractions compete with the rotational energy of the dimer, limiting the\nrange of validity of the perturbative approach to distances larger than 100\na.u.. Numerical results are given for the long-range interaction between Cs and\nCs$_2$, showing that the photoassociation is probably efficient whatever the\nCs$_2$ rotational energy.\n", "  We present measurements of Underlying Event observables in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 and 7 TeV. The analysis is performed as a function of the\nhighest charged-particle transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T, LT}$ in the event.\nDifferent regions are defined with respect to the azimuthal direction of the\nleading (highest transverse momentum) track: Toward, Transverse and Away. The\nToward and Away regions collect the fragmentation products of the hardest\npartonic interaction. The Transverse region is expected to be most sensitive to\nthe Underlying Event activity. The study is performed with charged particles\nabove three different $p_{\\rm T}$ thresholds: 0.15, 0.5 and 1.0 GeV/$c$. In the\nTransverse region we observe an increase in the multiplicity of a factor 2-3\nbetween the lower and higher collision energies, depending on the track $p){\\rm\nT}$ threshold considered. Data are compared to Pythia 6.4, Pythia 8.1 and\nPhojet. On average, all models considered underestimate the multiplicity and\nsummed $p_{\\rm T}$ in the Transverse region by about 10-30%.\n", "  In this paper, we presented an experimental and theoretical analysis of the\nformation of the contact between a smooth elastomer lens and an elastomer\nsubstrate micropatterned with hexagonal arrays of cylindrical pillars. We show\nusing a JKR model coupled with a full description of the deformation of the\nsubstrate between the pillars that the transition between the top to the full\ncontact is obtain when the normal load is increased above a well predicted\nthreshold. We have also shown that above the onset of full contact, the\nevolution of the area of full contact was obeying a simple scaling.\n", "  The ALICE Collaboration has measured the inclusive production of muons from\nheavy flavour decays at forward rapidity, 2.5 < y < 4, in pp and Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt {s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential\ninclusive cross section of muons from heavy flavour decays in pp collisions is\ncompared to perturbative QCD calculations. The nuclear modification factor is\nstudied as a function of pt and collision centrality. A weak suppression is\nmeasured in peripheral collisions. In the most central collisions, a\nsuppression of a factor of about 3-4 is observed in 6 < $p_{\\rm T}$ < 10\nGeV/$c$. The suppression shows no significant $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence.\n", "  Using the multipolar expansion of the electrostatic energy, we have\ncharacterized the asymptotic interactions between an oxygen atom O$(^3P)$ and\nan oxygen molecule O$_2(^3\\Sigma_g^-)$, both in their electronic ground state.\nWe have calculated the interaction energy induced by the permanent electric\nquadrupoles of O and O$_2$ and the van der Waals energy. On one hand we\ndetermined the 27 electronic potential energy surfaces including spin-orbit\nconnected to the O$(^3P)$ + O$_2(^3\\Sigma_g^-)$ dissociation limit of the\nO--O$_2$ complex. On the other hand we computed the potential energy curves\ncharacterizing the interaction between O$(^3P)$ and a O$_2(^3\\Sigma_g^-)$\nmolecule in its lowest vibrational level and in a low rotational level. Such\ncurves are found adiabatic to a good approximation, namely they are only weakly\ncoupled to each other. These results represent a first step for modeling the\nspectroscopy of ozone bound levels close to the dissociation limit, as well as\nthe low energy collisions between O and O$_2$ thus complementing the knowledge\nrelevant for the ozone formation mechanism.\n", "  We consider the spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space time\nin the teleparallel model of gravity and assume that the universe is filled\nnearly by cold dark matter and a nonminimally coupled scalar field with a\npower-law potential as dark energy. We investigate the possibility that the\nuniverse undergoes a transition from quintessence to phantom phase. An\nanalytical solution for the scalar field is obtained and necessary conditions\nrequired for such a transition are discussed.\n", "  For the massless Nelson model we provide detailed information about the\ndependence of the normalized ground states $\\check{\\psi}_{P,\\sigma}$ of the\nfiber single-electron Hamiltonians $H_{P,\\sigma}$ on the total momentum $P$ and\nthe infrared cut-off $\\sigma$. This information is obtained with the help of\nthe iterative analytic perturbation theory. In particular, we derive bounds of\nthe form \\[ \\|\\partial_{P_i}\\check{\\psi}_{P,\\sigma}\\|,\\ \\| \\partial_{P_i}\n\\partial_{P_j}\\check{\\psi}_{P,\\sigma} \\|\\leq\n\\frac{c}{\\sigma^{\\delta_{\\lambda_0}}}, \\] for some constant $c$ and a function\nof the maximal admissible coupling constant $\\lambda_0\\mapsto\n\\delta_{\\lambda_0}$ s.t. $\\lim_{\\lambda_0\\to 0}\\delta_{\\lambda_0}=0$. These\nresults hold both in the infrared-regular and infrared-singular case. They are\nexploited in part I of this series to construct the two-electron scattering\nstates in the infrared-regular massless Nelson model (in the absence of an\ninfrared cut-off) along the lines of Haag-Ruelle scattering theory. They should\nalso be relevant for the problem of scattering of two infraparticles in the\ninfrared-singular Nelson model, whose solution is the goal of this series of\npapers. Although a part of a larger investigation, the present work is written\nin a self-contained fashion.\n", "  We computed the long-range interactions between two identical polar bialkali\nmolecules in their rovibronic ground level, for all ten species involving Li,\nNa, K, Rb and Cs, using accurate quantum chemistry results combined with\navailable spectroscopic data. Huge van der Waals interaction is found for eight\nspecies in free space. The competition of the van der Waals interaction with\nthe dipole-dipole interaction induced by an external electric field parallel or\nperpendicular to the intermolecular axis is investigated by varying the\nelectric field magnitude and the intermolecular distance. Our calculations\npredict a regime with the mutual orientation of the two molecules but with no\npreferential direction in the laboratory frame. A mechanism for the stimulated\none-photon radiative association of a pair of ultracold polar molecules into\nultracold tetramers is proposed, which would open the way towards the optical\nmanipulation of ultracold polyatomic molecules.\n", "  Ultracold atoms confined in a dipole trap are submitted to a potential whose\ndepth is proportional to the real part of their dynamic dipole polarizability.\nThe atoms also experience photon scattering whose rate is proportional to the\nimaginary part of their dynamic dipole polarizability. In this article we\ncalculate the complex dynamic dipole polarizability of ground-state erbium, a\nrare-earth atom that was recently Bose-condensed. The polarizability is\ncalculated with the sum-over-state formula inherent to second-order\nperturbation theory. The summation is performed on transition energies and\ntransition dipole moments from ground-state erbium, which are computed using\nthe Racah-Slater least-square fitting procedure provided by the Cowan codes.\nThis allows us to predict 9 unobserved odd-parity energy levels of total\nangular momentum J=5, 6 and 7, in the range 25000-31000 cm-1 above the ground\nstate. Regarding the trapping potential, we find that ground-state erbium\nessentially behaves like a spherically-symmetric atom, in spite of its large\nelectronic angular momentum. We also find a mostly isotropic van der Waals\ninteraction between two ground-state erbium atoms, characterized by a\ncoefficient C_6^{iso}=1760 a.u.. On the contrary, the photon-scattering rate\nshows a pronounced anisotropy, since it strongly depends on the polarization of\nthe trapping light.\n", "  We study Maurer-Cartan elements on homotopy Poisson manifolds of degree $n$.\nThey unify many twisted or homotopy structures in Poisson geometry and\nmathematical physics, such as twisted Poisson manifolds, quasi-Poisson\n$\\g$-manifolds, and twisted Courant algebroids. Using the fact that the dual of\nan $n$-term $L_\\infty$-algebra is a homotopy Poisson manifold of degree $n-1$,\nwe obtain a Courant algebroid from a $2$-term $L_\\infty$-algebra $\\g$ via the\ndegree $2$ symplectic NQ-manifold $T^*[2]\\g^*[1]$. By integrating the Lie\nquasi-bialgebroid associated to the Courant algebroid, we obtain a\nLie-quasi-Poisson groupoid from a $2$-term $L_\\infty$-algebra, which is\nproposed to be the geometric structure on the dual of a Lie $2$-algebra. These\nresults lead to a construction of a new 2-term $L_\\infty$-algebra from a given\none, which could produce many interesting examples.\n", "  The resolvent algebra is a new C*-algebra of the canonical commutation\nrelations of a boson field given by Buchholz-Grundling. We study analytic\nproperties of quasi-free dynamics on the resolvent algebra. Subsequently we\nconsider a supersymmetric quasi-free dynamics on the graded C*-algebra made of\na Clifford (fermion) algebra and a resolvent (boson) algebra. We establish an\ninfinitesimal supersymmetry formula upon the GNS Hilbert space for any regular\nstate satisfying some mild requirement which is standard in quantum field\ntheory. We assert that the supersymmetric dynamics is given as a C*-dynamics.\n", "  We establish a simple criterion for locating points where the transition\ndensity of a degenerate diffusion is strictly positive. Throughout, we assume\nthat the diffusion satisfies a stochastic differential equation (SDE) on\n$\\mathbf{R}^d$ with additive noise and polynomial drift. In this setting, we\nwill see that it is often that case that local information of the flow, e.g.\nthe Lie algebra generated by the vector fields defining the SDE at a point\n$x\\in \\mathbf{R}^d$, determines where the transition density is strictly\npositive. This is surprising in that positivity is a more global property of\nthe diffusion. This work primarily builds on and combines the ideas of Ben\nArous and L\\'eandre (1991) and Jurdjevic and Kupka (1981, 1985).\n", "  It has recently been noticed that the degeneracies of the Poisson bracket of\nlinearized gravity on constant curvature Lorentzian manifold can be described\nin terms of the cohomologies of a certain complex of differential operators.\nThis complex was first introduced by Calabi and its cohomology is known to be\nisomorphic to that of the (locally constant) sheaf of Killing vectors. We\nreview the structure of the Calabi complex in a novel way, with explicit\ncalculations based on representation theory of GL(n), and also some tools for\nstudying its cohomology in terms of of locally constant sheaves. We also\nconjecture how these tools would adapt to linearized gravity on other\nbackgrounds and to other gauge theories. The presentation includes explicit\nformulas for the differential operators in the Calabi complex, arguments for\nits local exactness, discussion of generalized Poincar\\'e duality, methods of\ncomputing the cohomology of locally constant sheaves, and example calculations\nof Killing sheaf cohomologies of some black hole and cosmological Lorentzian\nmanifolds.\n", "  The goal of this article is to prove that the determinantal formulas of the\nPainlev'e 2 system identify with the correlation functions computed from the\ntopological recursion on their spectral curve for an arbitrary non-zero\nmonodromy parameter. The result is established for two different Lax pairs\nassociated to the Painlev'e 2 system, namely the Jimbo-Miwa Lax pair and the\nHarnad-Tracy-Widom Lax pair, whose spectral curves are not connected by any\nsymplectic transformation. We provide a new method to prove the topological\ntype property without using the insertion operators. In the process, taking the\ntime parameter t to infinity gives that the symplectic invariants F(g) computed\nfrom the Hermite-Weber curve and the Bessel curve are equal to respectively.\nThis result generalizes similar results obtained from random matrix theory in\nthe special case where {\\theta} = 0. We believe that this approach should apply\nfor all 6 Painlev'e equations with arbitrary monodromy parameters. Explicit\ncomputations up to g = 3 are provided along the paper as an illustration of the\nresults.\n", "  The properties of the superconducting and the anomalous normal state have\nbeen described by using the Eliashberg method. The pairing mechanism has been\nreproduced with help of the Hamiltonian, which models the electron-phonon and\nelectron-electron-phonon interaction (EEPh). The set of the Eliashberg\nequations, which determines the order parameter function ($\\varphi$), the wave\nfunction renormalization factor ($Z$), and the energy shift function ($\\chi$)\nhas been derived. It has been proven that for the sufficiently large values of\nEEPh potential, the doping dependence of order parameter ($\\varphi/Z$) has the\nanalogous course to that observed experimentally in cuprates. The energy gap in\nthe electron density of states is induced by $Z$ and $\\chi$ - the contribution\nfrom $\\varphi$ is negligible. The electron density of states possesses the\ncharacteristic asymmetric form and the pseudogap is observed above the critical\ntemperature.\n", "  The (im)possibility of local distinguishability of orthogonal multipartite\nquantum states still remains an intriguing question. Beyond\n$\\mathbb{C}^{3}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{3}$, the problem remains unsolved even for\nmaximally entangled states (MES). So far, the only known condition for the\nlocal distinguishability of states is the well-known orthogonality preservation\n(OP). Using an upper bound on the locally accessible information for bipartite\nstates, we derive a very simple necessary condition for any set of pairwise\northogonal MES in $\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}$ to be perfectly\nlocally distinguishable. This condition is seen to be stronger than the OP\ncondition. This is particularly so for any set of $d$ number of pairwise\northogonal MES in $\\mathbb{C}^{d}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d}$. When testing this\ncondition for the local distinguishability of all sets of four generalized Bell\nstates in $\\mathbb{C}^{4}\\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{4}$, we find that it is not only\nnecessary but also sufficient to determine their local distinguishability. This\ndemonstrates that the aforementioned upper-bound may play a significant role in\nthe general scenario of local distinguishability of bipartite states.\n", "  Heat conduction at low temperatures show various effects that cannot be\ndescribed by the Fourier law, like the second sound and ballistic propagation.\nIn this paper the performance of various theories is compared in case of\nballistic and wave like propagation of heat pulses in NaF.\n", "  If axion-like particles (ALPs) constitute a major part of dark matter (DM),\ndue to the bosonic nature and a relative small mass, they could behave\ndifferently from the point like dark matter particles on the formation of the\ncosmic structures. When studying the structure formation, it is often useful to\nconsider DM as a special fluid with a given density and a given velocity. ALP\nfluid obeys a same continuity equation comparing to the point-like\ncollisionless DM but has a different first-order velocity equation. In the\nlinear regime of structure formation, the resulted observational differences\nare negligible for the QCD axions but can be interesting for very light ALPs.\n", "  Here, we investigate the growth of matter density perturbations as well as\nthe generalized second law (GSL) of thermodynamics in the framework of\n$f(R)$-gravity. We consider a spatially flat FRW universe filled with the\npressureless matter and radiation which is enclosed by the dynamical apparent\nhorizon with the Hawking temperature. For some viable $f(R)$ models containing\nthe Starobinsky, Hu-Sawicki, Exponential, Tsujikawa and AB models, we first\nexplore numerically the evolution of some cosmological parameters like the\nHubble parameter, the Ricci scalar, the deceleration parameter, the density\nparameters and the equation of state parameters. Then, we examine the validity\nof GSL and obtain the growth factor of structure formation. We find that for\nthe aforementioned models, the GSL is satisfied from the early times to the\npresent epoch. But in the farther future, the GSL for the all models is\nviolated. Our numerical results also show that for the all models, the growth\nfactor for larger structures like the $\\Lambda$CDM model fit the data very\nwell.\n", "  Single component nonrelativistic dissipative fluids are treated independently\nof reference frames and flow-frames. First the basic fields and their balances,\nthen the related thermodynamic relations and the entropy production are\ncalculated and the linear constitutive relations are given.\n  The usual basic fields of mass, momentum, energy and their current densities,\nthe heat flux, pressure tensor and diffusion flux are the time- and spacelike\ncomponents of the third order mass-momentum-energy density-flux four-tensor.\nThe corresponding Galilean transformation rules of the physical quantities are\nderived.\n  It is proved, that the non-equilibrium thermodynamic frame theory, including\nthe thermostatic Gibbs relation and extensivity condition and also the entropy\nproduction is independent of the reference frame and also the flow-frame of the\nfluid. The continuity-Fourier-Navier-Stokes equations are obtained almost in\nthe traditional form if the flow of the fluid is fixed to the temperature. This\nchoice of the flow-frame is the thermo-flow.\n  A simple consequence of the theory is that the relation between the total,\nkinetic and internal energies is a Galilean transformation rule.\n", "  The efficiency of laser-cooling relies on the existence of an almost closed\noptical-transition cycle in the energy spectrum of the considered species. In\nthis respect rare-earth elements exhibit many transitions which are likely to\ninduce noticeable leaks from the cooling cycle. In this work, to determine\nwhether laser-cooling of singly-ionized erbium Er$^+$ is feasible, we have\nperformed accurate electronic-structure calculations of energies and\nspontaneous-emission Einstein coefficients of Er$^+$, using a combination of\n\\textit{ab initio} and least-square-fitting techniques. We identify five weak\nclosed transitions suitable for laser-cooling, the broadest of which is in the\nkilohertz range. For the strongest transitions, by simulating the cascade\ndynamics of spontaneous emission, we show that repumping is necessary, and we\ndiscuss possible repumping schemes. We expect our detailed study on Er$^+$ to\ngive a good insight into laser-cooling of neighboring ions like Dy$^+$.\n", "  Using the multipolar expansion of electrostatic and magnetostatic potential\nenergies, we characterize the long-range interactions between two weakly-bound\ndiatomic molecules, taking as an example the paramagnetic Er$_2$ Feshbach\nmolecules which were produced recently. Since inside each molecule, individual\natoms conserve their identity, the intermolecular potential energy can be\nexpanded as the sum of pairwise atomic potential energies. In the case of\nEr$_2$ Feshbach molecules, we show that the interaction between atomic magnetic\ndipoles gives rise to the usual $R^{-3}$ term of the multipolar expansion, with\n$R$ the intermolecular distance, but also to additional terms scaling as\n$R^{-5}$, $R^{-7}$, and so on. Those terms are due to the interaction between\neffective molecular multipole moments, and are strongly anisotropic with\nrespect to the orientation of the molecules. Similarly the atomic pairwise van\nder Waals interaction results in $R^{-6}$, $R^{-8}$, ... terms in the\nintermolecular potential energy. By calculating the reduced electric-quadrupole\nmoment of erbium ground level $\\langle J=6||\\hat{Q}_2||J=6\\rangle = -1.305$\na.u., we also demonstrate that the electric-quadrupole interaction energy is\nnegligible with respect to the magnetic-dipole and van der Waals interaction\nenergies. The general formalism presented in this article can be applied to\ncalculate the long-range potential energy between arbitrary charge\ndistributions composed of almost free subsystems.\n", "  In a heterostructure of graphene and the ferromagnetic insulator EuO, the Eu\natoms induce proximity exchange and inter-valley interactions in the graphene\nlayer. Constrained by the lattice symmetries, and guided by ab initio\ncalculations, a model Hamiltonian is constructed that describes the low-energy\nbands. Band parameters such as proximity induced exchange splitting, spin orbit\ncoupling, and inter-valley interaction are determined. Calculations of the\nChern number identify the conditions under which the hetero-structures exhibit\ntopologically non-trivial bands that give rise to the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect with a Hall conductivity of $\\sigma_{xy} = 2 e^2/h$.\n", "  We review the current state of knowledge of magnetic fields inside stars,\nconcentrating on recent developments concerning magnetic fields in stably\nstratified (zones of) stars, leaving out convective dynamo theories and\nobservations of convective envelopes. We include the observational properties\nof A, B and O-type main-sequence stars, which have radiative envelopes, and the\nfossil field model which is normally invoked to explain the strong fields\nsometimes seen in these stars. Observations seem to show that Ap-type stable\nfields are excluded in stars with convective envelopes. Most stars contain both\nradiative and convective zones, and there are potentially important effects\narising from the interaction of magnetic fields at the boundaries between them.\nRelated to this, we discuss whether the Sun could harbour a magnetic field in\nits core. Recent developments regarding the various convective and radiative\nlayers near the surfaces of early-type stars and their observational effects\nare examined. We look at possible dynamo mechanisms that run on differential\nrotation rather than convection. Finally we turn to neutron stars with a\ndiscussion of the possible origins for their magnetic fields.\n", "  The conditions of existence of extra mass flux in single component\ndissipative non-relativistic fluids are clarified. By considering Galilean\ninvariance we show that if total mass flux is equal to total momentum density,\nthen mass, momentum, angular momentum and booster (center-of-mass) are\nconserved. However, these conservation laws may be fulfilled also by other\nmeans. We show an example of weakly non-local hydrodynamics where the\nconservation laws are satisfied as well although the total mass flux is\ndifferent from momentum density.\n", "  In several frameworks for leptons-sectors of two Higgs doublet models, we\ncalculate the magnetic dipole moment for the different flavor types of\nneutrino. Computations are carried out by assuming a normal hierarchy for\nneutrino masses, and analyzing the process $\\nu \\rightarrow \\nu \\gamma $ with a\ncharged Higgs boson into the loop. The analysis was performed by sweeping the\ncharged Higgs mass and taking into account the experimental constraints for\nrelevant parameters in Two Higgs Doublet Models with and without flavor\nchanging neutral currents; obtaining magnetic dipole moments close to the\nexperimental thresholds for tau neutrinos in type II and Lepton-specific cases.\nIn the neutrino-specific scenario, the contribution of new physics could be\nsizeable to the current measurement for flavor magnetic dipole moment. This\nfact leads to excluding possible zones in the parameter space of charged Higgs\nmass and vacuum expectation value of the second doublet.\n", "  In order to investigate the electronic state of Ce-free and Ce-underdoped\nhigh-Tc cuprates with the so-called T' structure, we have performed\nmuon-spin-relaxation (muSR) and specific-heat measurements of Ce-free\nT'-La_1.8_Eu_0.2_CuO_4+d_ (T'-LECO) polycrystals and Ce-underdoped\nT'-Pr_1.3-x_La_0.7_Ce_x_CuO_4+d_ (T'-PLCCO) single crystals with x=0.10. The\nmuSR spectra of the reduced superconducting samples of both T'-LECO with Tc=15K\nand T'-PLCCO with x=0.10 and Tc=27K have revealed that a short-range magnetic\norder coexists with the superconductivity in the ground state. The formation of\na short-range magnetic order due to a tiny amount of excess oxygen in the\nreduced superconducting samples strongly suggest that the Ce-free and\nCe-underdoped T'-cuprates are regarded as strongly correlated electron systems.\n", "  The Zamolodchikov c-theorem has led to important new insights in our\nunderstanding of the renormalisation group and the geometry of the space of\nQFTs. Here, we review the parallel developments of the search for a\nhigher-dimensional generalisation of the c-theorem and of the Local\nRenormalisation Group.\n  The idea of renormalisation with position-dependent couplings, running under\nlocal Weyl scaling, is traced from its early realisations to the elegant modern\nformalism of the local renormalisation group. The key role of the associated\nWeyl consistency conditions in establishing RG flow equations for the\ncoefficients of the trace anomaly in curved spacetime, and their relation to\nthe c-theorem and four-dimensional a-theorem, is explained in detail.\n  A number of different derivations of the c-theorem in two dimensions are\npresented -- using spectral functions, RG analysis of Green functions of the\nenergy-momentum tensor T_{mu nu}, and dispersion relations -- and are\ngeneralised to four dimensions. The obstruction to establishing monotonic\nC-functions related to the beta_c and beta_b trace anomaly coefficients in four\ndimensions is discussed. The possibility of deriving an a-theorem, involving\nthe coefficient beta_a of the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet density in the trace anomaly,\nis explored initially by formulating the QFT on maximally symmetric spaces.\nThen the formulation of the weak a-theorem using a dispersion relation for\nfour-point functions of T^mu_mu is presented.\n  Finally, we describe the application of the local renormalisation group to\nthe issue of limit cycles in theories with a global symmetry and it is shown\nhow this sheds new light on the geometry of the space of couplings in QFT.\n", "  We report the first observation of the radiative charm decay $D^0 \\to \\rho^0\n\\gamma$ and the first search for $CP$ violation in decays $D^0 \\to \\rho^0\n\\gamma$, $\\phi\\gamma$, and $\\overline{K}{}^{*0} \\gamma$, using a data sample of\n943 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+e^-$ collider. The branching fraction is measured to be $\\mathcal{B}(D^0\n\\to \\rho^0 \\gamma)=(1.77 \\pm 0.30 \\pm 0.07) \\times 10^{-5}$, where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The obtained $CP$\nasymmetries, $\\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^0 \\to \\rho^0 \\gamma)=+0.056 \\pm 0.152 \\pm\n0.006$, $\\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^0 \\to \\phi \\gamma)=-0.094 \\pm 0.066 \\pm 0.001$, and\n$\\mathcal{A}_{CP}(D^0 \\to \\overline{K}{}^{*0} \\gamma)=-0.003 \\pm 0.020 \\pm\n0.000$, are consistent with no $CP$ violation. We also present an improved\nmeasurement of the branching fractions $\\mathcal{B}(D^0 \\to \\phi \\gamma)=(2.76\n\\pm 0.19 \\pm 0.10) \\times 10^{-5}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(D^0 \\to \\overline{K}{}^{*0}\n\\gamma)=(4.66 \\pm 0.21 \\pm 0.21) \\times 10^{-4}$.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a deformed AdS background and study effect of\ndeformation parameter on the pair production rate of the Schwinger effect. The\nelectrostatic potential is important for the pair production in the holographic\nSchwinger effect. In this paper, we analyze the electrostatic potential in a\ndeformed AdS background and investigate the effect of deformation parameter\nwhich may be useful to test of AdS/QCD. In the case of zero temperature we find\nthat larger value of the deformation parameter leads to a smaller value of\nseparation length of the test particles on the probe. Also we find a finite\nmaximum of separation length in presence of modification parameter.\n", "  The quasinormal modes for a scalar field in the background spacetime\ncorresponding to a black hole, with a cloud of strings, in\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and the tensor quasinormal modes corresponding\nto perturbations in such spacetime, were both calculated using the WKB\napproximation. In the obtained results we emphasize the role played by the\nparameter associated with the string cloud, comparing them with the results\nalready obtained for the Boulware-Deser metric. We also study how the\nGauss-Bonnet correction to general relativity affects the results for the\nquasinormal modes, comparing them with the same background in general\nrelativity.\n", "  We consider the Dyson hierarchical graph $\\mathcal{G}$, that is a weighted\nfully-connected graph, where the pattern of weights is ruled by the parameter\n$\\sigma \\in (1/2, 1]$. Exploiting the deterministic recursivity through which\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is built, we are able to derive explicitly the whole set of the\neigenvalues and the eigenvectors for its Laplacian matrix. Given that the\nLaplacian operator is intrinsically implied in the analysis of dynamic\nprocesses (e.g., random walks) occurring on the graph, as well as in the\ninvestigation of the dynamical properties of connected structures themselves\n(e.g., vibrational structures and the relaxation modes), this result allows\naddressing analytically a large class of problems. In particular, as examples\nof applications, we study the random walk and the continuous-time quantum walk\nembedded in $\\mathcal{G}$, and the relaxation times of a polymer whose\nstructure is described by $\\mathcal{G}$.\n", "  In this paper we study Markov processes and related first passage problems on\na class of weighted, modular graphs which generalize the Dyson hierarchical\nmodel. In these networks, the coupling strength between two nodes depends on\ntheir distance and is modulated by a parameter $\\sigma$. We find that, in the\nthermodynamic limit, ergodicity is lost and the \"distant\" nodes can not be\nreached. Moreover, for finite-sized systems, there exists a threshold value for\n$\\sigma$ such that, when $\\sigma$ is relatively large, the inhomogeneity of the\ncoupling pattern prevails and \"distant\" nodes are hardly reached. The same\nanalysis is carried on also for generic hierarchical graphs, where interactions\nare meant to involve $p$-plets ($p>2$) of nodes, finding that ergodicity is\nstill broken in the thermodynamic limit, but no threshold value for $\\sigma$ is\nevidenced, ultimately due to a slow growth of the network diameter with the\nsize.\n", "  Let $V$ be a simple vertex operator algebra, and $G$ a finite automorphism\ngroup of $V$ such that $V^G$ is regular. The definition of entries in\n$S$-matrix on $V^G$ is discussed, and then is extended. The set of\n$V^G$-modules can be considered as a unitary space. In this paper, we obtain\nsome connections between $V$-modules and $V^G$-modules over that unitary space.\nAs an application, we determine the fusion rules for irreducible $V^G$-modules\nwhich occur as submodules of irreducible $V$-modules by the fusion rules for\nirreducible $V$-modules and by the structure of $G$.\n", "  Topological superconductor is a very interesting and frontier topic in\ncondensed matter physics1. Despite the tremendous efforts in exploring the\ntopological superconductivity, its presence is however still under heavy\ndebates. The Dirac electrons are supposed to exist in a thin layer of the\nsurface of a topological insulator. Due to the finite spin-orbital coupling,\nthese electrons will have a spin-momentum locking effect. In this case, the\nsuperfluid with the spin singlet Cooper pairing is not completely comforted by\nthe Dirac electrons. It thus remains unclear whether and how the Dirac\nelectrons fall into Cooper pairing in an intrinsic superconductor with the\ntopological surface states. In this work, we show the systematic study of\nscanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy on the possible topological\nsuperconductor SrxBi2Se3. We first show that only the intercalated (or\ninserted), not the substituted Sr atoms can induce superconductivity. Then we\nshow the full superconducting gaps without any abnormal in-gap density of\nstates as expected theoretically for the bulk topological superconductivity.\nHowever, we find that the surface Dirac electrons will simultaneously condense\ninto the superconducting state when the energy is smaller than the bulk\nsuperconducting gap. This vividly demonstrates how the surface Dirac electrons\nare driven into Cooper pairs.\n", "  By analyzing the key properties of black holes from the point of view of\nquantum information, we derive a model-independent picture of black hole\nquantum computing. It has been noticed that this picture exhibits striking\nsimilarities with quantum critical condensates, allowing the use of a common\nlanguage to describe quantum computing in both systems. We analyze such quantum\ncomputing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that the\nexternal influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic\nproperties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial\ntime-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal\nentanglement and total scrambling. We show that for black hole type quantum\ncomputers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-life\ntime. Furthermore, we construct explicitly a set of Hamiltonians that generates\na universal set of quantum gates for the black hole type computer. We find that\nthe gates work at maximal energy efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a\nfundamental bound on the complexity of quantum circuits encoded on these\nsystems, and characterize the unitary operations that are implementable. It\nbecomes apparent that the computational power is very limited due to the fact\nthat the black hole life-time is of the same order of the gate operation time.\nAs a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve its information, within the\nlife-time of a black hole, by externally coupling to the black hole qubits.\nHowever, we show that, in principle, coupling to some of the internal degrees\nof freedom allows acquiring knowledge about the micro-state. Still, due to the\ntrivial complexity of operations that can be performed, there is no time\nadvantage over the collection of Hawking radiation and subsequent decoding.\n", "  The use of an interferometer to perform an ultra-precise parameter estimation\nunder noisy conditions is a challenging task. Here we discuss nearly optimal\nmeasurement schemes for a well known,sensitive input state, squeezed vacuum and\ncoherent light. We find that a single mode intensity measurement, while the\nsimplest and able to beat the shot-noise limit, is outperformed by other\nmeasurement schemes in the low-power regime. However, at high powers, intensity\nmeasurement is only outperformed by a small factor. Specifically, we confirm,\nthat an optimal measurement choice under lossless conditions is the parity\nmeasurement. In addition, we also discuss the performance of several other\ncommon measurement schemes when considering photon loss, detector efficiency,\nphase drift, and thermal photon noise. We conclude that, with noise\nconsiderations, homodyne remains near optimal in both the low and high power\nregimes. Surprisingly, some of the remaining investigated measurement schemes,\nincluding the previous optimal parity measurement, do not remain even near\noptimal when noise is introduced.\n", "  We report on the morphological effects induced by the inhomogeneous\nabsorption of cylindrically polarized femtosecond laser irradiation of silver\n(Ag) in sub-ablation conditions. A theoretical prediction of the role of\nsurface plasmon excitation in the production of self-formed periodic ripples\nstructures is evaluated. Furthermore, a combined hydrodynamical and\nthermoelastic model is presented to account for the influence of\ntemperature-related lattice movements in laser beam conditions that are\nsufficient to produce material melting. The ability to control the size of the\nmorphological changes via modulating the beam polarization aims to provide a\nsystematic methodology for controlling and optimizing the outcome of laser\nmicro-processing.\n", "  Detecting spatial and temporal information of individual photons by using\nsingle-photon-detector (SPD) arrays is critical to applications in\nspectroscopy, communication, biological imaging, astronomical observation, and\nquantum-information processing. Among the current SPDs1,detectors based on\nsuperconducting nanowires have outstanding performance2, but are limited in\ntheir ability to be integrated into large scale arrays due to the engineering\ndifficulty of high-bandwidth cryogenic electronic readout3-8. Here, we address\nthis problem by demonstrating a scalable single-photon imager using a single\ncontinuous photon-sensitive superconducting nanowire microwave-plasmon\ntransmission line. By appropriately designing the nanowire's local\nelectromagnetic environment so that the nanowire guides microwave plasmons, the\npropagating voltages signals generated by a photon-detection event were slowed\ndown to ~ 2% of the speed of light. As a result, the time difference between\narrivals of the signals at the two ends of the nanowire naturally encoded the\nposition and time of absorption of the photon. Thus, with only two readout\nlines, we demonstrated that a 19.7-mm-long nanowire meandered across an area of\n286 {\\mu}m * 193 {\\mu}m was capable of resolving ~590 effective pixels while\nsimultaneously recording the arrival times of photons with a temporal\nresolution of 50 ps. The nanowire imager presents a scalable approach to\nrealizing high-resolution photon imaging in time and space.\n", "  We present firstly the equation of motion for a test scalar particle coupling\nto Einstein tensor in the Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole spacetime through the\nshort-wave approximation. Through analysing Poincar\\'{e} sections, the power\nspectrum, the fast Lyapunov exponent indicator and the bifurcation diagram, we\ninvestigate the effects of coupling parameter on the chaotic behavior of the\nparticles. With the increase of the coupling strength, we find that the motion\nof coupled particle for the chosen parameters becomes more regular and order\nfor the negative couple constant. While, for the positive one, the motion of\ncoupled particles first undergoes a series of transitions between chaotic\nmotion and regular motion and then falls into horizon or escapes to spatial\ninfinite. Our results show that the coupling brings about richer effects for\nthe motion of the particles.\n", "  We investigate the transient dynamics of photon statistics through two-time\ncorrelation functions for optical fields. We find that the transient\ncorrelations at different time t yield a smooth transition from antibunching to\nbunching photon statistics in the weak system-environment coupling regime. In\nthe strong-coupling regime, the two-time correlations exhibit\nbunching-antibunching oscillations that persists both in the transient process\nand in the steady-state limit. The photon bunching-antibunching oscillations is\na manifestation of strong non-Markovian dynamics, where the system remains in\nnonequilibrium from its environment. We also find that the antibunching to\nbunching transition in the weak-coupling regime and the bunching-antibunching\noscillation in the strong-coupling regime are strongly influenced by the\ninitial environment temperature.\n", "  The universal blind quantum computation protocol (UBQC) (Broadbent,\nFitzsimons, Kashefi 2009) enables an almost classical client to delegate a\nquantum computation to an untrusted quantum server (in form of a garbled\nquantum computation) while the security for the client is unconditional. In\nthis contribution we explore the possibility of extending the verifiable UBQC\n(Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2012), to achieve further functionalities as was done for\nclassical garbled computation. First, exploring the asymmetric nature of UBQC\n(client preparing only single qubits, while the server runs the entire quantum\ncomputation), we present a \"Yao\" type protocol for secure two party quantum\ncomputation. Similar to the classical setting (Yao 1986) our quantum Yao\nprotocol is secure against a specious (quantum honest-but-curious) garbler, but\nin our case, against a (fully) malicious evaluator. Unlike the protocol in\n(Dupuis, Nielsen, Salvail 2010), we do not require any online-quantum\ncommunication between the garbler and the evaluator and thus no extra\ncryptographic primitive. This feature will allow us to construct a simple\nuniversal one-time compiler for any quantum computation using one-time memory,\nin a similar way with the classical work of (Goldwasser, Kalai, Rothblum 2008)\nwhile more efficiently than the previous work of (Broadbent, Gutoski, Stebila\n2013).\n", "  Identifying signatures of dark matter at indirect-detection experiments is\ngenerally more challenging for scenarios involving non-minimal dark sectors\nsuch as Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) than for scenarios involving a single dark\nparticle. This additional difficulty arises because the partitioning of the\ntotal dark-matter abundance across an ensemble of different constituent\nparticles with different masses tends to \"smear\" the injection spectra of\nphotons and other cosmic-ray particles that are produced via dark-matter\nannihilation or decay. As a result, the imprints of the dark sector on these\ncosmic-ray flux spectra typically take the form of continuum features rather\nthan sharp peaks or lines. In this paper, however, we identify an unambiguous\nsignature of non-minimal dark sectors such as DDM which can overcome these\nissues and potentially be observed at gamma-ray telescopes operating in the MeV\nrange. We discuss the specific situations in which this signature can arise,\nand demonstrate that this signature can be exploited in order to significantly\nenhance our ability to resolve the unique spectral features of DDM and other\nnon-minimal dark sectors at future gamma-ray facilities.\n", "  Bottomonium production in heavy ion collisions is modified compared with any\nsimple extrapolation from elementary collisions. This modification is most\nlikely caused by the presence of a deconfined system of quarks and gluons for\ntimes of several fm/c. In such a medium, bottomonium can be destroyed, but the\nconstituent bottom quarks will likely stay spatially correlated due to small\nmean free paths in this system. With these facts in mind, we describe\nbottomonium formation with a coupled set of equations. A rate equation\ndescribes the destruction of $\\Upsilon(1S)$ particles, while a Langevin\nequation describes how the bottom quarks stay correlated for a sufficiently\nlong time so that recombination into bottomonia is possible. We show that\nwithin this approach it is possible to understand the magnitude of\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$ suppression in heavy ion collisions and the larger suppression\nof the $\\Upsilon(2S)$ state, implying that the reduction in the ratio of\n$\\Upsilon(1S)/\\Upsilon(2S)$ yield in heavy ion collision does not necessarily\ncorrespond to sequential melting picture.\n", "  Very wide binaries (> 500 AU) are subject to numerous encounters with\nflying-by stars in the Galactic field and can be perturbated into highly\neccentric orbits (e ~ 0.99). For such systems tidal interactions at close\npericenter passages can lead to orbit circularization and possibly mass\ntransfer, consequently producing X-Ray binaries without the need for common\nenvelope. We test this scenario for the case of Black Hole Low-Mass X-Ray\nBinaries (BH LMXBs) by performing a population synthesis from primordial\nbinaries with numerical treatment of random stellar encounters. We test various\nmodels for the threshold pericenter distance under which tidal forces cause\ncircularization. We estimate that fly-by interactions can produce a current\npopulation of ~ 60$-$220 BH LMXBs in the Galactic field. The results are\nsensitive to the assumption on tidal circularization efficiency and zero to\nvery small BH natal kicks of a few km/s are required. We show that the most\nlikely donors are low-mass stars (< 1 Msun; at the onset of mass transfer) as\nobserved in the population of known sources (~ 20). However, the low number of\nsystems formed along this route is in tension with most recent observational\nestimate of the number of dormant BH LMXBs in the Galaxy 10$^4-$10$^8$\n(Tetarenko et al. 2016). If indeed the numbers are so high, alternative\nformation channels of BHs with low-mass donors need to be identified.\n", "  An optical model for a solar power tower with an open volumetric air receiver\n(OVAR) was developed in this paper, and the optical performance and\ncharacteristics of the OVAR were studied based on the model. Firstly, the\ndetailed distributions of the non-uniform solar flux (qsr) on the aperture and\nthe solar source (Ssr) in the OVAR were studied. The solar flux was found to be\nrelatively uniform across the aperture for a single OVAR. However the incident\nangle of the rays varies between 0o and 42o, which indicates that the parallel\nassumption of the rays is not appropriate at this condition. Furthermore, the\nSsr in the absorber decreases from the inlet to the outlet, and the maximum\nsource (Ssr,max) of 2.414X108 Wm-3 appears at the inlet. Moreover, the Ssr,max\nwas found to appear at the region near the wall rather than the center of the\nreceiver as usual for the combined effect of the non-parallel incident rays and\nthe diffuse reflection on the wall. In addition, study on effects of the porous\nparameters indicates that the solid emissivity influences both the Ssr\ndistribution and the receiver efficiency significantly. However, the pore\ndiameter and the porosity influence Ssr distribution importantly, but have\nnegligible effect on the efficiency. Finally, the optical efficiency of 86.70%,\nreflection loss of 13.20% and transmission loss of 0.10% were found to be\nachieved by the OVAR.\n", "  The efficiency of optical trapping of ultracold atoms depend on the atomic\ndynamic dipole polarizability governing the atom-field interaction. In this\narticle, we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of the dynamic dipole\npolarizability of dysprosium in the ground and first excited level. Due to the\nhigh electronic angular momentum of those two states, the polarizabilities\npossess scalar, vector and tensor contributions that we have computed, on a\nwide range of trapping wavelengths, using the sum-over-state formula. Using the\nsame formalism, we have also calculated the $C_6$ coefficients characterizing\nthe van der Waals interaction between two dysprosium atoms in the two lowest\nlevels. We have computed the energies of excited states and the transition\nprobabilities appearing in the sums, using a combination of \\textit{ab initio}\nand least-square-fitting techniques provided by the Cowan codes and extended in\nour group. Regarding the real part of the polarizability, for field frequencies\nfar from atomic resonances, the vector and tensor contributions are\ntwo-order-of-magnitude smaller than the scalar contribution, whereas for the\nimaginary part, the vector and tensor contributions represent a noticeable\nfraction of the scalar contribution. This offers the possibility to control the\ndecoherence and trap losses due to spontaneous emission.\n", "  Topological superconductivity is the quantum condensate of paired electrons\nwith an odd parity of the pairing function. One of the candidates is the\ntriplet pairing superconductor derived from topological insulator Bi2Se3 by\nchemical doping. Theoretically it was predicted that a two-fold superconducting\norder parameter may exist in this kind of bulk topological superconductor.\nEarlier experiments by nuclear magnetic resonance and angle-resolved\nmagnetocaloric measurements seem to support this picture. By using a\nCorbino-shape like electrode configuration, we measure the c-axis resistivity\nwithout the influence of the vortex motion and find clear evidence of two-fold\nsuperconductivity in the recently discovered topological superconductor\nSrxBi2Se3. The Laue diffraction measurements on these samples show that the\nmaximum gap direction is either parallel or perpendicular to the main\ncrystallographic axis.\n", "  Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by 2D atomic crystals provide a\npowerful approach towards designer condensed matter systems. Incommensurate\nheterobilayers with small twisting and/or lattice mismatch lead to the\ninteresting concept of Moir\\'e superlattice, where the atomic registry is\nlocally indistinguishable from commensurate bilayers but has local-to-local\nvariation over long range. Here we show that such Moir\\'e superlattice can lead\nto periodic modulation of local topological order in vdW heterobilayers formed\nby two massive Dirac materials. By tuning the vdW heterojunction from normal to\nthe inverted type-II regime via an interlayer bias, the commensurate\nheterobilayer can become a topological insulator (TI), depending on the\ninterlayer hybridization controlled by the atomic registry between the vdW\nlayers. This results in mosaic pattern of TI regions and normal insulator (NI)\nregions in Moir\\'e superlattices, where topologically protected helical modes\nexist at the TI/NI phase boundaries. By using symmetry based k.p and\ntight-binding models, we predict that this topological phenomenon can be\npresent in inverted transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers. Our work\npoints to a new means of realizing programmable and electrically switchable\ntopological superstructures from 2D arrays of TI nano-dots to 1D arrays of TI\nnano-stripes.\n", "  We consider a periodic Schr\\\"odinger operator in two dimensions perturbed by\na weak magnetic field whose intensity slowly varies around a positive mean. We\nshow in great generality that the bottom of the spectrum of the corresponding\nmagnetic Schr\\\"odinger operator develops spectral islands separated by gaps,\nreminding of a Landau-level structure.\n  First, we construct an effective Hofstadter-like magnetic matrix which\naccurately describes the low lying spectrum of the full operator. The\nconstruction of this effective magnetic matrix does not require a gap in the\nspectrum of the non-magnetic operator, only that the first and the second Bloch\neigenvalues do not cross but their ranges might overlap. The crossing case is\nmore difficult and will be considered elsewhere.\n  Second, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the effective matrix using\na gauge-covariant magnetic pseudo-differential calculus adapted to slowly\nvarying magnetic fields. As an application, we prove in the overlapping case\nthe appearance of spectral islands separated by gaps.\n", "  A non-classical light source emitting pairs of identical photons represents a\nversatile resource of interdisciplinary importance with applications in quantum\noptics and quantum biology. Emerging research fields, which benefit from such\ntype of quantum light source, include quantum-optical spectroscopy or\nexperiments on photoreceptor cells sensitive to photon statistics. To date,\nphoton twins have mostly been generated using parametric downconversion\nsources, relying on Poissonian number distributions, or atoms, exhibiting low\nemission rates. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the efficient,\ntriggered generation of photon twins using the energy-degenerate\nbiexciton-exciton radiative cascade of a single semiconductor quantum dot.\nDeterministically integrated within a microlens, this nanostructure emits\nhighly-correlated photon pairs, degenerate in energy and polarization, at a\nrate of up to (234 $\\pm$ 4) kHz. Furthermore, we verify a significant degree of\nphoton-indistinguishability and directly observe twin-photon emission by\nemploying photon-number-resolving detectors, which enables the reconstruction\nof the emitted photon number distribution.\n", "  We investigate the problem of periodically modulated strongly interacting\nneutron matter. We carry out ab initio non-perturbative auxiliary-field\ndiffusion Monte Carlo calculations using an external sinusoidal potential in\naddition to phenomenological two- and three-nucleon interactions. Several\nchoices for the wave function ansatz are explored and special care is taken to\nextrapolate finite-sized results to the thermodynamic limit. We perform\ncalculations at various densities as well as at different strengths and\nperiodicities of the one-body potential. Our microscopic results are then used\nto constrain the isovector term from energy-density functional theories of\nnuclei at many different densities, while making sure to separate isovector\ncontributions from bulk properties. Lastly, we use our results to extract the\nstatic density-density linear response function of neutron matter at different\ndensities. Our findings provide insights into inhomogeneous neutron matter and\nare related to the physics of neutron star crusts and neutron-rich nuclei.\n", "  We study the quantum capacitance in a topological insulator thin film system\nmagnetized in the in-plane direction in the presence of an out-of-plane\nmagnetic field and hexagonal warping. To first order, the modification in\nquantum capacitance due to hexagonal warping compared to the clean case, where\nboth the in-plane magnetization and hexagonal warping are absent, is always\nnegative, and increases in magnitude monotonically with the energy difference\nfrom the charge neutrality point. In contrast, the change in the quantum\ncapacitance due to in-plane magnetization oscillates with the energy in\ngeneral, except when a certain relation between the inter-surface coupling, out\nof plane Zeeman energy splitting and magnetic field strength is satisfied. In\nthis special case, the quantum capacitance remains unchanged by the in-plane\nmagnetization for all energies.\n", "  Previous works in this series have shown that an instance of a\n$\\sqrt{8/3}$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) sphere has a well-defined distance\nfunction, and that the resulting metric measure space (mm-space) agrees in law\nwith the Brownian map (TBM). In this work, we show that given just the mm-space\nstructure, one can a.s. recover the LQG sphere. This implies that there is a\ncanonical way to parameterize an instance of TBM by the Euclidean sphere (up to\nM\\\"obius transformation). In other words, an instance of TBM has a canonical\nconformal structure.\n  The conclusion is that TBM and the $\\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG sphere are equivalent.\nThey ultimately encode the same structure (a topological sphere with a measure,\na metric, and a conformal structure) and have the same law. From this point of\nview, the fact that the conformal structure a.s. determines the metric and\nvice-versa can be understood as a property of this unified law. The results of\nthis work also imply that the analogous facts hold for Brownian and\n$\\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG surfaces with other topologies.\n", "  We study the non-uniqueness problem of the gauge-invariant angular momentum\nseparation for the case of QED, which stems from the recent controversy\nconcerning the proper definitions of the orbital angular momentum and spin\noperator of the individual parts of a gauge field system. For the free quantum\nelectrodynamics without matter, we show that the basic requirement of Euclidean\nsymmetry selects a unique physical angular momentum separation scheme from the\nmultitude of the possible angular momentum separation schemes constructed using\nthe various Gauge Invariant Extentions. Based on these results, we propose a\nset of natural angular momentum separation schemes for the case of interacting\nQED by invoking the formalism of asymptotic fields. Some perspectives on such a\nproblem for the case of QCD are briefly discussed.\n", "  In this paper we look at two naturally occurring situations where the\nfollowing question arises. When one can find a metric so that a Chern-Weil form\ncan be represented by a given form ? The first setting is semi-stable\nHartshorne-ample vector bundles on complex surfaces where we provide evidence\nfor a conjecture of Griffiths by producing metrics whose Chern forms are\npositive. The second scenario deals with a particular rank-2 bundle (related to\nthe vortex equations) over a product of a Riemann surface and the sphere.\n", "  We review detection methods that are currently in use or have been proposed\nto search for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation. We consider\nboth Bayesian and frequentist searches using ground-based and space-based laser\ninterferometers, spacecraft Doppler tracking, and pulsar timing arrays; and we\nallow for anisotropy, non-Gaussianity, and non-standard polarization states.\nOur focus is on relevant data analysis issues, and not on the particular\nastrophysical or early Universe sources that might give rise to such\nbackgrounds. We provide a unified treatment of these searches at the level of\ndetector response functions, detection sensitivity curves, and, more generally,\nat the level of the likelihood function, since the choice of signal and noise\nmodels and prior probability distributions are actually what define the search.\nPedagogical examples are given whenever possible to compare and contrast\ndifferent approaches. We have tried to make the article as self-contained and\ncomprehensive as possible, targeting graduate students and new researchers\nlooking to enter this field.\n", "  Systems passing through quantum critical points at finite rates have a finite\nprobability of undergoing transitions between different eigenstates of the\ninstantaneous Hamiltonian. This mechanism was proposed by Kibble as the\nunderlying mechanism for the formation of topological defects in the early\nuniverse and by Zurek for condensed matter systems. Here, we use a system of\nnuclear spins as an experimental quantum simulator undergoing a non-equilibrium\nquantum phase transition. The experimental data confirm the validity of the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation.\n", "  The excitation of toroidal multipoles in metamaterials was investigated for\nhigh-Q response at a subwavelength scale. In this study, we explored the\noptimization of toroidal excitations in a planar metamaterial comprised of\nasymmetric split ring resonators (ASRRs). It was found that the scattering\npower of toroidal dipole can be remarkably strengthened by adjusting the\ncharacteristic parameter of ASRRs: asymmetric factor. Interestingly, the\nimprovement in toroidal excitation accompanies increment on the Q-factor of the\ntoroidal metamaterial; it is shown that both the scattering power of toroidal\ndipole and the Q-factor were increased more than one order by changing the\nasymmetric factor of ASRRs. The optimization in excitation of toroidal\nmultipole provide opportunity to further increase the Q-factor of metamaterial\nand boost light-matter interactions at the subwavelength scale for potential\napplications in low-power nonlinear processing, and sensitive photonic\napplications.\n", "  We have measured the running of the effective QED coupling constant\n$\\alpha(s)$ in the time-like region $0.6<\\sqrt s< 0.975$ GeV with the KLOE\ndetector at DA$\\Phi$NE using the Initial State Radiation process\n$e^+e^-\\to\\mu^+ \\mu^-\\gamma$. It represents the first measurement of the\nrunning of $\\alpha(s)$ in this energy region. Our results show a more than\n5$\\sigma$ significance of the hadronic contribution to the running of\n$\\alpha(s)$, which is the strongest direct evidence both in time- and\nspace-like regions achieved in a single measurement. By using the\n$e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section measured by KLOE, the real and imaginary\npart of the shift $\\Delta\\alpha(s)$ has been extracted. By a fit of the real\npart of $\\Delta\\alpha(s)$ and assuming the lepton universality the branching\nratio $BR(\\omega\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-) = (6.6\\pm1.4_{stat}\\pm1.7_{syst})\\cdot 10^{-5} $\nhas been determined.\n", "  We explore a scenario where local interactions form one-dimensional gapped\ninterfaces between a pair of distinct chiral two-dimensional topological states\n- referred to as phases 1 and 2 - such that each gapped region terminates at a\ndomain wall separating the chiral gapless edge states of these phases. We show\nthat this type of T-junction supports point-like fractionalized excitations\nobeying parafermion statistics, thus implying that the one-dimensional gapped\ninterface forms an effective topological parafermionic wire possessing a\nnon-trivial ground state degeneracy. The physical properties of the anyon\ncondensate that gives rise to the gapped interface are investigated.\nRemarkably, this condensate causes the gapped interface to behave as a type of\nanyon \"Andreev reflector\" in the bulk, whereby anyons from one phase, upon\nhitting the interface, can be transformed into a combination of reflected\nanyons and outgoing anyons from the other phase. Thus, we conclude that while\ndifferent topological orders can be connected via gapped interfaces, the\ninterfaces are themselves topological.\n", "  The results of a detailed study of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nsurface state energy structure in the vicinity of surface steps using scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy methods are presented. An increase in the\nchemical potential level $\\mu$ near the step edge is observed. The value of the\nincrease $\\delta \\mu\\sim 0.1$~eV is found to correlate with the step height.\nThe effect is caused by redistribution of electron wave functions between the\nouter and inner edges of surface steps, as known for normal metals. The smaller\nvalue of the chemical potential shift and its larger characteristic length of\n$\\sim 10$~nm reflect specifics of the helical surface states. This increase is\naccompanied by enlargement of the normalized differential tunneling conductance\nin the helical surface states energy region and thereby produces the illusion\nof the appearance of edge states. We show that the enlargement is reproduced in\nthe framework of the tunneling model taking into account the tunneling gap\ntransparency change when the chemical potential moves away from the Dirac\npoint.\n", "  Many models currently exist which attempt to interpret the excess of gamma\nrays emanating from the Galactic Center in terms of annihilating or decaying\ndark matter. These models typically exhibit a variety of complicated cascade\nmechanisms for photon production, leading to a non-trivial kinematics which\nobscures the physics of the underlying dark sector. In this paper, by contrast,\nwe observe that the spectrum of the gamma-ray excess may actually exhibit an\nintriguing \"energy-duality\" invariance under $E_\\gamma \\rightarrow\nE_\\ast^2/E_\\gamma$ for some $E_\\ast$. As we shall discuss, such an energy\nduality points back to a remarkably simple alternative kinematics which in turn\nis realized naturally within the Dynamical Dark Matter framework. Observation\nof this energy duality could therefore provide considerable information about\nthe properties of the dark sector from which the Galactic-Center gamma-ray\nexcess might arise, and highlights the importance of acquiring more complete\ndata for the Galactic-Center excess in the energy range around 1 GeV.\n", "  We examine the doping effects in the two-dimensional periodic Anderson model\nusing the determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method. We observe bound\nstates around the Kondo hole site and find that the heavy electron states are\ndestroyed at the nearest-neighbor sites. Our results show no clear sign of\nhybridization oscillation predicted in previous mean-field calculations. We\nfurther study the electron transport with increasing doping and as a function\nof temperature and obtain a critical doping at x_c~0.6 that marks a transition\nfrom the Kondo insulator regime to the single-ion Kondo regime. The value of\nx_c is in good agreement with the predicted threshold for the site percolation.\nOur results confirm the percolative nature of the insulator-metal transition\nobserved in doped Kondo insulators.\n", "  Results are presented from a search for the electroweak production of\nsupersymmetric particles in pp collisions in final states with two tau leptons.\nThe data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity between 18.1 inverse\nfemtobarns and 19.6 inverse femtobarns depending on the final state of tau\nlepton decays, at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC.\nThe observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the\nexpected standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted using\nsimplified models describing the pair production and decays of charginos or tau\nsleptons. For models describing the pair production of the lightest chargino,\nexclusion limits are obtained in the plane of chargino mass vs. neutralino mass\nunder the following assumptions: the chargino decays into third-generation\nsleptons, which are taken as the lightest sleptons, and the slepton masses lie\nmidway between those of the chargino and the neutralino. Chargino masses below\n420 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level in the limit of a massless\nneutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325\nGeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the\ncross section for pair production of tau sleptons as a function of mass,\nassuming a massless neutralino.\n", "  We study the quantum gravity modification of the Kuroda-Papapetrou model\ninduced by the running of the Newton's constant at high energy in Quantum\nEinstein Gravity. We argue that although the antiscreening character of the\ngravitational interaction favours the formation of a naked singularity, quantum\ngravity effects turn the classical singularity into a \"whimper\" singularity\nwhich remains naked for a finite amount of advanced time.\n", "  The total cross sections were measured for coherent double neutral-pion\nphotoproduction on the deuteron at incident energies below 0.9 GeV for the\nfirst time. No clear resonance-like behavior is observed in the excitation\nfunction for $W_{\\gamma d}=2.38$--2.61 GeV, where the $d^*(2380)$ dibaryon\nresonance observed at COSY is expected to appear. The measured excitation\nfunction is consistent with the existing theoretical calculation for this\nreaction. The upper limit of the total cross section is found to be\n$0.034$~$\\mu$b for the dibaryon resonance at $W_{\\gamma d}=2.37$~GeV (90\\%\nconfidence level) in the $\\gamma d \\to \\pi^0\\pi^0 d$ reaction.\n", "  Motivated by Planck confirmation of an anomalously low value of the CMB\ntemperature fluctuations up to multipole $\\ell<40$, we in this paper try to\nexplain such feature by investigating case of punctuated inflation scenario.\nThis form of inflation potential is inspired by Minimal Super-symmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) wherein suppression of curvature perturbation power at\nlarge scales is produced by introducing period of fast-roll phase of the\ninflation sandwiched between two stages of slow-roll phase.\n  We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to determine posterior\ndistribution and the best fit values of the model parameters using recent WMAP9\nand Planck data. We show that WMAP9 and Planck results are consistent with each\nother and that with Planck data we obtain tighter constraints for punctuated\ninflation parameters. We find that punctuated inflation leads to better fit in\nCMB data compared to simple power law model. The improvement in the fit to the\nWMAP9 data is $\\Delta \\chi^2\\sim 3.6$ and for Planck the improvement is $\\Delta\n\\chi^2\\sim 5.4$. We find that $AIC$ does not discriminate between punctuated\ninflation and simple power law model for WMAP9 data. However, for Planck data\nwe find that punctuated inflation is moderately preferred over a simple power\nlaw model.\n", "  We investigate proximity-induced superconductivity in monolayers of\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the presence of an externally\ngenerated exchange field. A variety of superconducting order parameters is\nfound to emerge from the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity, covering\nthe entire spectrum of possibilities to be symmetric or antisymmetric with\nrespect to the valley and spin degrees of freedom, as well as even or odd in\nfrequency. More specifically, when a conventional \\emph{s}-wave superconductor\nwith singlet Copper pairs is tunnel-coupled to the TMD layer, both spin-singlet\nand triplet pairings between electrons from the same and opposite valleys arise\ndue to the combined effects of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and a\nmagnetic-substrate-induced exchange field. As a key finding, we reveal the\nexistence of an exotic even-frequency triplet pairing between equal-spin\nelectrons from different valleys, which arises whenever the spin orientations\nin the two valleys are noncollinear. All types of superconducting order turn\nout to be highly tunable via straightforward manipulation of the external\nexchange field.\n", "  The location of zeros of the basic double sum over the square lattice is\nstudied. This sum can be represented in terms of the product of the Riemann\nzeta function and the Dirichlet beta function, so that the assertion that all\nits non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line is a particular case of the\nGeneralised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). The treatment given here is an extension\nof that in two previous papers (arxiv:1601.01724, 1602.06330), where it was\nshown that non trivial zeros of the double sum either lie on the critical line\nor on lines of unit modulus of an analytic function intersecting the critical\nline. The extension enables more specific conclusions to be drawn about the\narrangement of zeros of the double sum on the critical line, which are\ninterleaved with zeros of analytic functions, all of which lie on the critical\nline. Possible arrangements of zeros are studied, and it is shown that in all\nidentified cases the GRH holds.\n", "  We study transverse-momentum-dependent factorization at twist-3 for Drell-Yan\nprocesses. The factorization can be derived straightforwardly at leading order\nof $\\alpha_s$. But at this order we find that light-cone singularities already\nexist and effects of soft gluons are not correctly factorized. We regularize\nthe singularities with gauge links off the light-cone and introduce a soft\nfactor to factorize the effects of soft gluons. Interestingly, the soft factor\nmust be included in the definition of subtracted TMD parton distributions to\ncorrectly factorize the effects of soft gluons. We derive the Collins-Soper\nequation for one of twist-3 TMD parton distributions. The equation can be\nuseful for resummation of large logarithms terms appearing in the corresponding\nstructure function in collinear factorization. However, the derived equation is\nnonhomogeneous. This will make the resummation complicated.\n", "  The concept of super-resolution refers to various methods for improving the\nangular resolution of an optical imaging system beyond the classical\ndiffraction limit. Although several techniques to narrow the central lobe of\nthe illumination Point Spread Function have been developed in optical\nmicroscopy, most of these methods cannot be implemented on astronomical\ntelescopes. A possible exception is represented by the variable transmittance\nfilters, also known as \"Toraldo Pupils\" (TPs) since they were introduced for\nthe first time by G. Toraldo di Francia in 1952. In the microwave range, the\nfirst successful laboratory test of TPs was performed in 2003. These first\nresults suggested that TPs could represent a viable approach to achieve\nsuper-resolution in Radio Astronomy. We have therefore started a project\ndevoted to a more exhaustive analysis of TPs and how they could be implemented\non a radio telescope. In the present work we report on the results of extensive\nmicrowave measurements, using TPs with different geometrical shapes, which\nconfirm the correctness of the first experiments in 2003. We have also extended\nthe original investigation to carry out full-wave electromagnetic numerical\nsimulations and also to perform planar scanning of the near-field and transform\nthe results into the far-field.\n", "  LHC searches for BSM resonances in $l^+ l^-, \\, jj, \\, t\\bar{t}, \\gamma\n\\gamma$ and $VV$ final states have so far not resulted in discovery of new\nphysics. Current results set lower limits on mass scales of new physics\nresonances well into the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV range, assuming that the new\nresonance decays dominantly to a pair of Standard Model particles. While the SM\npair searches are a vital probe of possible new physics, it is important to\nre-examine the scope of new physics scenarios probed with such final states.\nScenarios where new resonances decay dominantly to final states other than SM\npairs, even though well theoretically motivated, lie beyond the scope of SM\npair searches. In this paper we argue that LHC searches for (vector) resonances\nbeyond two particle final states would be useful complementary probes of new\nphysics scenarios. As an example, we consider a class of composite Higgs\nmodels, and identify specific model parameter points where the color singlet,\nelectrically neutral vector resonance $\\rho_0$ decays dominantly not to a pair\nof SM particles, but to a fermionic top partner $T_{f1}$ and a top quark, with\n$T_{f1} \\rightarrow tZ$. We show that dominant decays of $\\rho_0 \\rightarrow\nT_{f1} t$ in the context of Composite Higgs models are possible even when the\ndecay channel to a pair of $T_{f1}$ is kinematically open. Our analysis deals\nwith scenarios where both $m_\\rho$ and $m_{T_{f1}}$ are of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nTeV, leading to highly boosted $t\\bar{t}Z$ final state topologies. We show that\nthe particular composite Higgs scenario we consider is discoverable at the\nLHC13 with as little as 30 fb$^{-1}$, while being allowed by other existing\nexperimental constraints.\n", "  We synthesized a series of Nb$_{2}$Pd$_{1-x}$Ru$_{x}$S$_{5}$ polycrystalline\nsamples by a solid-state reaction method and systematically investigated the\nRu-doping effect on superconductivity by transport and magnetic measurements.\nIt is found that superconductivity is enhanced with Ru doping and is quite\nrobust upon disorder. Hall coefficient measurements indicate that the charge\ntransport is dominated by hole-type charge carriers similar to the case of Ir\ndoping, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. Upon Ru or Ir doping, \\emph\nH$_{c2}$/$\\emph T_c$ exhibits a significant enhancement, exceeding the Pauli\nparamagnetic limit value by a factor of approximately 4. A comparison of $T_c$\nand the upper critical field ($H_{c2}$) amongst the different doping elements\non Pd site, reveals a significant role of spin--orbit coupling.\n", "  We develop general quantitative criteria for dynamic interference, a\nmanifestation of double-slit interference in time which should be realizable\nwith brilliant state-of-the-art high-frequency laser sources. Our analysis\nreveals that the observation of dynamic interference hinges upon maximizing the\ndifference between the dynamic polarization of the initial bound and the final\ncontinuum state of the electron during the light pulse, while keeping depletion\nof the initial state small. Confirmed by numerical results, we predict that\nthis is impossible for the hydrogen ground-state but feasible with excited\nstates explicitly exemplified with the hydrogen 2p-state.\n", "  Direct detection bounds are beginning to constrain a very simple model of\nweakly interacting dark matter---a Majorana fermion with a coupling to the $Z$\nboson. In a particularly straightforward gauge-invariant realization, this\ncoupling is introduced via a higher-dimensional operator. While attractive in\nits simplicity, this model generically induces a large $\\rho$ parameter. An\nultraviolet completion that avoids an overly large contribution to $\\rho$ is\nthe singlet-doublet model. We revisit this model, focusing on the Higgs blind\nspot region of parameter space where spin-independent interactions are absent.\nThis model successfully reproduces dark matter with direct detection mediated\nby the $Z$ boson, but whose cosmology may depend on additional couplings and\nstates. Future direct detection experiments should effectively probe a\nsignificant portion of this parameter space, aside from a small coannihilating\nregion. As such, $Z$-mediated thermal dark matter as realized in the\nsinglet-doublet model represents an interesting target for future searches.\n", "  We present a highly frequency multiplexed readout for large-format\nsuperconducting detector arrays intended for use in the next generation of\nballoon-borne and space-based sub-millimeter and far-infrared missions. We will\ndemonstrate this technology on the upcoming NASA Next Generation Balloon-borne\nLarge Aperture Sub-millimeter Telescope (BLAST-TNG) to measure the polarized\nemission of Galactic dust at wavelengths of 250, 350 and 500 microns. The\nBLAST-TNG receiver incorporates the first arrays of Lumped Element Kinetic\nInductance Detectors (LeKID) along with the first microwave multiplexing\nreadout electronics to fly in a space-like environment and will significantly\nadvance the TRL for these technologies. After the flight of BLAST-TNG, we will\ncontinue to improve the performance of the detectors and readout electronics\nfor the next generation of balloon-borne instruments and for use in a future\nFIR Surveyor.\n", "  We argue that flat space amplitudes for the process $ 2 \\to n$ gravitons at\ncenter of mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$ much less than the Planck scale, will\ncoincide approximately with amplitudes calculated from correlators of a\nboundary CFT for AdS space of radius $R\\gg L_P$, only when $n < R/L_P$ . For\nlarger values of $n$ in AdS space, insisting that all the incoming energy\nenters \"the arena\" [arXiv:hep-th/9901079], implies the production of black\nholes, whereas there is no black hole production in the flat space amplitudes.\nWe also argue, from unitarity, that flat space amplitudes for all $n$ are\nnecessary to reconstruct the complicated singularity at zero momentum in the $2\n\\to 2$ amplitude, which can therefore not be reproduced as the limit of an AdS\ncalculation. Applying similar reasoning to amplitudes for real black hole\nproduction in flat space, we argue that unitarity of the flat space S-matrix\ncannot be assessed or inferred from properties of CFT correlators.\n", "  Placing graphene on SnS2 results in significant charge transfer, on the order\nof 10^13/cm^2, from the graphene to the SnS2, and the charge transfer results\nin a negative Schottky barrier contact for electron injection from the graphene\ninto the SnS2 conduction band. However, due to the s-px,y composition of the\nSnS2 conduction band, the coupling between the SnS2 and the graphene is\nrelatively weak. A third layer, HfSe2, placed between the SnS2 and the\ngraphene, serves as a matrix element matching layer, since it has strong\ncoupling to both the graphene and the SnS2. It increases the coupling to the\ngraphene by a factor of 10, and it has little effect on the negative Schottky\nbarrier height, since the conduction band wavefucntion of the SnS2 / HfSe2 is a\ncoherent superposition of the orbitals from the two individual layers, such\nthat there is no energy barrier for an electron to move between the two layers.\nThis paper first investigates the electronic properties of the heterostructure\nbilayer SnS2 / HfSe2 in the presence of an applied vertical electric field, and\nthen it investigates the trilayer systems of BN / SnS2 / HfSe2 and graphene /\nSnS2 / HfSe2. A tunneling Hamiltonian estimate of the the contact resistance of\nthe graphene to the SnS2 / HfSe2 heterostructure indicates an excellent\nlow-resistance contact.\n", "  We show that the Feynman propagator (or the d'Alembertian) of a causal set\ncontains the complete information about the causal set. Intuitively, this is\nbecause the Feynman propagator, being a correlator that decays with distance,\nprovides a measure for the invariant distance between pairs of events. Further,\nwe show that even the spectra alone (of the self-adjoint and anti-self-adjoint\nparts) of the propagator(s) and d'Alembertian already carry large amounts of\ngeometric information about their causal set. This geometric information is\nbasis independent and also gauge invariant in the sense that it is relabeling\ninvariant (which is analogue to diffeomorphism invariance). We provide\nnumerical evidence that the associated spectral distance between causal sets\ncan serve as a measure for the geometric similarity between causal sets.\n", "  We demonstrate superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with 76 +/- 4\n% system detection efficiency at a wavelength of 315 nm and an operating\ntemperature of 3.2 K, with a background count rate below 1 count per second at\nsaturated detection efficiency. We propose integrating these detectors into\nplanar surface electrode radio-frequency Paul traps for use in trapped ion\nquantum information processing. We operate detectors integrated into test ion\ntrap structures at 3.8 K both with and without typical radio-frequency trapping\nelectric fields. The trapping fields reduce system detection efficiency by 9 %,\nbut do not increase background count rates.\n", "  The energy in turbulent flow can be amplified by compression, when the\ncompression occurs on a timescale shorter than the turbulent dissipation time.\nThis mechanism may play a part in sustaining turbulence in various\nastrophysical systems, including molecular clouds. The amount of turbulent\namplification depends on the net effect of the compressive forcing and\nturbulent dissipation. By giving an argument for a bound on this dissipation,\nwe give a lower bound for the scaling of the turbulent velocity with\ncompression ratio in compressed turbulence. That is, turbulence undergoing\ncompression will be enhanced at least as much as the bound given here, subject\nto a set of caveats that will be outlined. Used as a validation check, this\nlower bound suggests that some simulations and models of compressing\nastrophysical turbulence are too dissipative. The technique used highlights the\nrelationship between compressed turbulence and decaying turbulence.\n", "  The Jacobi metric derived from the line element by one of the authors is\nshown to reduce to the standard formulation in the non-relativistic\napproximation. We obtain the Jacobi metric for various stationary metrics.\nFinally, the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric is formulated for time-dependent metrics\nby including the Eisenhart-Duval lift, known as the Jacobi-Eisenhart metric.\n", "  We report on the design, fabrication and optical characterization of\nbichromatic photonic crystal cavities in thin silicon membranes, with\nresonances around 1550 nm wavelength. The cavity designs are based on a\nrecently proposed photonic crystal implementation of the Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper\nbichromatic potential, which relies on the superposition of two one-dimensional\nlattices with non-integer ratio between the periodicity constants. In photonic\ncrystal nanocavities, this confinement mechanism is such that optimized figures\nof merit can be straightforwardly achieved, in particular an ultra-high-Q\nfactor and diffraction-limited mode volume. Several silicon membrane photonic\ncrystal nanocavities with Q-factors in the 1 million range have been realized,\nas evidenced by resonant scattering. The generality of these designs and their\neasy implementation and scalability make these results particularly interesting\nfor realizing highly performing photonic nanocavities on different materials\nplatforms and operational wavelengths.\n", "  We propose a new representation of the nonlinear sigma model that exhibits a\nmanifest duality between flavor and kinematics. The fields couple exclusively\nthrough cubic Feynman vertices which also serve as the structure constants of\nan underlying kinematic algebra. The action is invariant under a combination of\ninternal and spacetime symmetries whose conservation equations imply\nflavor-kinematics duality, ensuring that all Feynman diagrams satisfy kinematic\nJacobi identities. Substituting flavor for kinematics, we derive a new cubic\naction for the special Galileon theory. In this picture, the vanishing soft\nbehavior of amplitudes is a byproduct of the Weinberg soft theorem.\n", "  We computed spin wave dispersions of surface-reconstructed Co films on the\nW(110) surface in the adiabatic approximation. The magnetic exchange\ninteractions are obtained via first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker Green function method. We analyze\nthe strength and oscillatory behavior of the intralayer and interlayer magnetic\ninteractions and investigate the resulting spin wave dispersions as a function\nof the thickness of Co films. In particular, we highlight and explain the\nstrong impact of hybridization of the electronic states at the Co-W interface\non the magnetic exchange interactions and on the spin wave dispersions. We\ncompare our results to recent measurements based on electron energy loss\nspectroscopy [E. Michel, H. Ibach, and C.M. Schneider, Phys. Rev. B 92, 024407\n(2015)]. Good overall agreement with experimental findings can be obtained by\nconsidering the possible overestimation of the spin splitting, stemming from\nthe local spin density approximation, and adopting an appropriate correction.\n", "  A search for ultra-high energy photons with energies above 1 EeV is performed\nusing nine years of data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory in hybrid\noperation mode. An unprecedented separation power between photon and hadron\nprimaries is achieved by combining measurements of the longitudinal air-shower\ndevelopment with the particle content at ground measured by the fluorescence\nand surface detectors, respectively. Only three photon candidates at energies 1\n- 2 EeV are found, which is compatible with the expected hadron-induced\nbackground. Upper limits on the integral flux of ultra-high energy photons of\n0.027, 0.009, 0.008, 0.008 and 0.007 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derived\nat 95% C.L. for energy thresholds of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 EeV. These limits bound\nthe fractions of photons in the all-particle integral flux below 0.1%, 0.15%,\n0.33%, 0.85% and 2.7%. For the first time the photon fraction at EeV energies\nis constrained at the sub-percent level. The improved limits are below the flux\nof diffuse photons predicted by some astrophysical scenarios for cosmogenic\nphoton production. The new results rule-out the early top-down models $-$ in\nwhich ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced by, e.g., the decay of\nsuper-massive particles $-$ and challenge the most recent super-heavy dark\nmatter models.\n", "  We provide a comprehensive multi-aspect study on the performance of a\npipeline used by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration for estimating parameters of\ngravitational-wave bursts. We add simulated signals with four different\nmorphologies (sine-Gaussians, Gaussians, white-noise bursts, and binary black\nhole signals) to simulated noise samples representing noise of the two Advanced\nLIGO detectors during their first observing run. We recover them with the\nBayesWave (BW) pipeline to study its accuracy in sky localization, waveform\nreconstruction, and estimation of model-independent waveform parameters. BW\nlocalizes sources with a level of accuracy comparable for all four\nmorphologies, with the median separation of actual and estimated sky locations\nranging from 25.1$^{\\circ}$ to 30.3$^{\\circ}$. This is a reasonable accuracy in\nthe two-detector case, and is comparable to accuracies of other localization\nmethods studied previously. As BW reconstructs generic transient signals with\nsine-Gaussian wavelets, it is unsurprising that BW performs the best in\nreconstructing sine-Gaussian and Gaussian waveforms. BW's accuracy in waveform\nreconstruction increases steeply with network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR$_{\\rm\nnet}$), reaching a $85\\%$ and $95\\%$ match between the reconstructed and actual\nwaveform below SNR$_{\\rm net} \\approx 20$ and SNR$_{\\rm net} \\approx 50$,\nrespectively, for all morphologies. BW's accuracy in estimating central moments\nof waveforms is only limited by statistical errors in the frequency domain, and\nis affected by systematic errors too in the time domain as BW cannot\nreconstruct low-amplitude parts of signals overwhelmed by noise. The figures of\nmerit we introduce can be used in future characterizations of parameter\nestimation pipelines.\n", "  Inspired by the recent measurement of the $h \\to \\mu \\tau$ decays by the CMS\ncollaboration at the LHC, we study the lepton flavour-violating (LFV) $B_s \\to\n\\mu \\tau$ decays in the general two Higgs doublet model. Those LFV interactions\ncould accommodate the present deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment\nand also predict the LFV $\\tau$ decay processes such as $\\tau \\to \\mu \\mu \\mu$\nand $\\tau \\to \\mu \\gamma$. We find that the $B_s \\to \\mu \\tau$ decay rates\nshould be sizable with above experimental conditions in the framework of our\nmodel. These processes are expected to be observed at the colliders such as\nLHCb and Belle-II in the future.\n", "  The transmission of polarized light through a two-dimensional randomly rough\ninterface between two dielectric media has been much less studied, by any\napproach, than the reflection of light from such an interface. We have derived\na reduced Rayleigh equation for the transmission amplitudes when p- or\ns-polarized light is incident on this type of interface, and have obtained\nrigorous, purely numerical, nonperturbative solutions of it. The solutions are\nused to calculate the transmissivity and transmittance of the interface, the\nmean differential transmission coefficient, and the full angular distribution\nof the intensity of the transmitted light. These results are obtained for both\nthe case where the medium of incidence is the optically less dense medium and\nin the case where it is the optically more dense medium. Optical analogues of\nYoneda peaks observed in the scattering of x-rays from metal surfaces are\npresent in the results obtained in the former case. For p-polarized incident\nlight we observe Brewster scattering angles, angles at which the diffuse\ntransmitted intensity is zero in a single-scattering approximation, which\ndepend on the angle of incidence in contrast to the Brewster angle for\nflat-surface reflection.\n", "  We study $(2,2)$ and $(4,4)$ supersymmetric theories with superspace higher\nderivatives in two dimensions. A characteristic feature of these models is that\nthey have several different vacua, some of which break supersymmetry. Depending\non the vacuum, the equations of motion describe different propagating degrees\nof freedom. Various examples are presented which illustrate their generic\nproperties. As a by-product we see that these new vacua give a dynamical way of\ngenerating non-linear realizations. In particular, our 2D $(4,4)$ example is\nthe dimensional reduction of a 4D $N=2$ model, and gives a new way for the\nspontaneous breaking of extended supersymmetry.\n", "  The response of paper to humidity variations is a complex multi-scale\nproblem. The hygroscopic swelling of individual fibres and their interactions\nwithin the fibrous network govern the macroscopic response. At this scale,\nmoisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This\nwork focuses on several aspects of this issue. A macroscopic phenomenological\nhygro-mechanical model is first proposed, which aims at predicting moisture\ninduced out-of-plane deformations in paper sheets. The constitutive model is\nbased on the relation between these deformations and typical irreversible\nphenomena associated to the history of paper manufacturing, i.e. the release of\ndried-in strains. The model is used to describe bending induced by moisture\ngradients through the thickness of the sheet as well as buckling due to\nmoisture variation in the presence of mechanical constraints. The results of\nthe model show that the anisotropic sheet-level hygro-expansion has a strong\ninfluence on the instability phenomena. Moreover, a comparison with experiments\nprovides adequate semi-quantitative estimates. An additional step is made\ntowards the multi-scale understanding of paper hygro-mechanics. The fundamental\nmechanisms governing the macroscopic moisture induced response are investigated\non the basis of the underlying fibrous network. To this aim, a meso-structural\nmodel is developed which consists of a network of fibres randomly positioned in\na planar region according to an orientation probability density function. A\nseries of network simulations reveals that upon moisture content variations the\nexpansion of the inter-fibre bonding regions drives the overall deformation.\nParticularly in the case of anisotropic fibre orientation, this explains the\norigin of the macro-scale anisotropic hygro-expansion, which is essential for\nthe observed sheet-level instability phenomena.\n", "  The gravitational waves measured at LIGO are presumed here to come from\nmerging primordial black holes. We ask how these primordial black holes could\narise through inflationary models while not conflicting with current\nexperiments. Among the approaches that work, we investigate the opportunity for\ncorroboration through experimental probes of gravitational waves at pulsar\ntiming arrays. We provide examples of theories that are already ruled out,\ntheories that will soon be probed, and theories that will not be tested in the\nforeseeable future. The models that are most strongly constrained are those\nwith a relatively broad primordial power spectrum.\n", "  The measure of the triple Higgs coupling is one of the major goals of the\nhigh-luminosity run of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) as well as the\nfuture colliders, either leptonic such as the International Linear Collider\n(ILC) or hadronic such as the 100 TeV Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron\nmode (FCC-hh). We have recently proposed this observable as a test of neutrino\nmass generating mechanisms in a regime where heavy sterile neutrino masses are\nhard to be probed otherwise. We present in this article a study of the one-loop\ncorrected triple Higgs coupling in the inverse seesaw model, taking into\naccount all relevant constraints on the model. This is the first study of the\nimpact on the triple Higgs coupling of heavy neutrinos in a realistic,\nrenormalizable neutrino mass model. We obtain deviations from the Standard\nModel as large as to $\\sim +30\\%$ that are at the current limit of the HL-LHC\nsensitivity, but would be clearly visible at the ILC or at the FCC-hh.\n", "  This article studies the application of the Jacobi-Eisenhart lift, Jacobi\nmetric and Maupertius transformation to the Kepler system. We start by\nreviewing fundamentals and the Jacobi metric. Then we study various ways to\napply the lift to Kepler related systems: first as conformal description and\nBohlin transformation of Hooke's oscillator, second in contact geometry, third\nin Houri's transformation (Houri, Liouville integrability of Hamiltonian\nsystems and spacetime symmetry,\nhttp://www.geocities.jp/football\\_physicien/publication.html), coupled with\nMilnor's construction (Milnor, The American Mathematical Monthly 90 (1983)\n353-365) with eccentric anomaly.\n", "  The possibility to control the magnetic properties of a material with an\nelectric field at room temperature is highly desirable for modern applications.\nMoreover, a coupling between magnetic and electric orders within a single\nmaterial presenting a wide range of exceptional physical properties, such as\nbismuth iron garnet (BIG), may lead to great advances in the field of\nspintronic applications. In particular, the combination of the magnetoelectric\n(ME) coupling with the low damping of spin waves in BIG can allow the control\nand manipulation of spin waves by an electric field in magnonic devices. Here\nwe report the unambiguous observation of linear magnetoelectric coupling above\n300 K in BIG using ferromagnetic resonance technique with electric field\nmodulation. The measured coupling value is comparable with that observed for\nprototypal magnetoelectric Cr2O3. On the basis of our experimental results, the\nstrength of this linear ME coupling is directly linked to the presence of\nbismuth ions inducing strong spin orbit coupling and to the appearance of local\nmagnetic inhomogeneities related to the magnetic domain structure. The\nunprecedented combination of magnetic, optical and magnetoelectrical properties\nin BIG is expected to trigger significant interest for technological\napplications as well as for theoretical studies.\n", "  Disorder - impurities and defects violating an ideal order - is always\npresent in solids. It can result in interesting and sometimes unexpected\neffects in multiband superconductors. Especially if the superconductivity is\nunconventional thus having other than the usual s-wave symmetry. This paper\nuses the examples of iron-based pnictides and chalcogenides to examine how both\nnonmagnetic and magnetic impurities affect superconducting states with $s_\\pm$\nand $s_{++}$ order parameters. We show that disorder causes the transitions\nbetween $s_\\pm$ and $s_{++}$ states and examine observable effects these\ntransitions can produce.\n", "  A new ternary platinum phosphide CePt$_{3}$P was synthesized and\ncharacterized by means of magnetic, thermodynamic and transport measurements.\nThe compound crystallizes in an antiperovskite tetragonal structure similar to\nthat in the canonical family of platinum-based superconductors $A$Pt$_{3}$P\n($A$ = Sr, Ca, La) and closely related to the noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion\nsuperconductor CePt$_{3}$Si. In contrast to all the superconducting\ncounterparts, however, no superconductivity is observed in CePt$_{3}$P down to\n0.5 K. Instead, CePt$_{3}$P displays a coexistence of antiferromagnetic\nordering, Kondo effect and crystalline electric field effect. A field-induced\nspin-flop transition is observed below the magnetic ordering temperature\n$T_{N1}$ of 3.0 K while the Kondo temperature is of similar magnitude as\n$T_{N1}$. The obtained Sommerfeld coefficient of electronic specific heat is\n${\\gamma}_{Ce}$ = 86 mJ/molK$^{2}$ indicating that CePt$_{3}$P is a moderately\ncorrelated antiferromagnetic Kondo lattice compound.\n", "  We present a theory of surface plasma waves (SPWs) in metals with arbitrary\nelectronic collision rate $1/\\tau$. We show that there exists a universal\nintrinsic amplification channel for these waves, as a result of the unique\ninterplay between ballistic electronic motions and the metal surface. The\ncorresponding intrinsic amplification rate $\\gamma_0$ is shown to be\nindependent of $\\tau$. We also study its dependence on surface scattering\nproperties.\n", "  Graphene and some graphene like two dimensional materials; hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) and silicene have unique mechanical properties which severely\nlimit the suitability of conventional theories used for common brittle and\nductile materials to predict the fracture response of these materials. This\nstudy revealed the fracture response of graphene, hBN and silicene nanosheets\nunder different tiny crack lengths by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using\nLAMMPS. The useful strength of these large area two dimensional materials are\ndetermined by their fracture toughness. Our study shows a comparative analysis\nof mechanical properties among the elemental analogues of graphene and\nsuggested that hBN can be a good substitute for graphene in terms of mechanical\nproperties. We have also found that the pre-cracked sheets fail in brittle\nmanner and their failure is governed by the strength of the atomic bonds at the\ncrack tip. The MD prediction of fracture toughness shows significant difference\nwith the fracture toughness determined by Griffth's theory of brittle failure\nwhich restricts the applicability of Griffith's criterion for these materials\nin case of nano-cracks. Moreover, the strengths measured in armchair and zigzag\ndirections of nanosheets of these materials implied that the bonds in armchair\ndirection has the stronger capability to resist crack propagation compared to\nzigzag direction.\n", "  Gladders et al. have recently suggested that the star formation histories\n(SFHs) of individual galaxies are characterized by a log-normal function in\ntime, implying a slow decline rather than rapid quenching. We test their\nconjecture on theoretical SFHs from the cosmological simulation Illustris and\non observationally inferred SFHs. While the log-normal form necessarily ignores\nshort-lived features such as starbursts, it fits the overall shape of the\nmajority of SFHs very well. In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are\nfitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and\n99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the\ncommonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more\nthan three free parameters. Poor fits are mostly found in galaxies that were\nrapidly quenched after becoming satellites. We explore the log-normal parameter\nspace of normalization, peak time, and full width at half maximum, and find\nthat the simulated and observed samples occupy similar regions, though\nIllustris predicts wider, later-forming SFHs on average. The ensemble of\nlog-normal fits correctly reproduces complex metrics such as the evolution of\nIllustris galaxies across the star formation main sequence, but overpredicts\ntheir quenching timescales. SFHs in Illustris are a diverse population not\ndetermined by any one physical property of galaxies, but follow a tight\nrelation, where $\\mathrm{width}\\propto\\mathrm{(peak\\ time)}^{3/2}$. We show\nthat such a relation can be explained qualitatively (though not quantitatively)\nby a close connection between the growth of dark matter halos and their\ngalaxies.\n", "  It has been pointed out that non-singular cosmological solutions in\nsecond-order scalar-tensor theories generically suffer from gradient\ninstabilities. We extend this no-go result to second-order gravitational\ntheories with an arbitrary number of interacting scalar fields. Our proof\nfollows directly from the action of generalized multi-Galileons, and thus is\ndifferent from and complementary to that based on the effective field theory\napproach. Several new terms for generalized multi-Galileons on a flat\nbackground were proposed recently. We find a covariant completion of them and\nconfirm that they do not participate in the no-go argument.\n", "  We present a new approach based on linear integro-differential operators with\nlogarithmic kernel related to the Hadamard fractional calculus in order to\ngeneralize, by a parameter $\\nu \\in (0,1]$, the logarithmic creep law known in\nrheology as Lomnitz law (obtained for $\\nu=1$). We derive the constitutive\nstress-strain relation of this generalized model in a form that couples memory\neffects and time-varying viscosity. Then, based on the hereditary theory of\nlinear viscoelasticity, we also derive the corresponding relaxation function by\nsolving numerically a Volterra integral equation of the second kind. So doing\nwe provide a full characterization of the new model both in creep and in\nrelaxation representation, where the slow varying functions of logarithmic type\nplay a fundamental role as required in processes of ultra slow kinetics.\n", "  We introduce a new model for the formation and evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in the RAMSES code using sink particles, improving over\nprevious work the treatment of gas accretion and dynamical evolution. This new\nmodel is tested against a suite of high-resolution simulations of an isolated,\ngas-rich, cooling halo. We study the effect of various feedback models on the\nSMBH growth and its dynamics within the galaxy.\n  In runs without any feedback, the SMBH is trapped within a massive bulge and\nis therefore able to grow quickly, but only if the seed mass is chosen larger\nthan the minimum Jeans mass resolved by the simulation. We demonstrate that, in\nthe absence of supernovae (SN) feedback, the maximum SMBH mass is reached when\nActive Galactic Nucleus (AGN) heating balances gas cooling in the nuclear\nregion.\n  When our efficient SN feedback is included, it completely prevents bulge\nformation, so that massive gas clumps can perturb the SMBH orbit, and reduce\nthe accretion rate significantly. To overcome this issue, we propose an\nobservationally motivated model for the joint evolution of the SMBH and a\nparent nuclear star cluster (NSC), which allows the SMBH to remain in the\nnuclear region, grow fast and resist external perturbations. In this scenario,\nhowever, SN feedback controls the gas supply and the maximum SMBH mass now\ndepends on the balance between AGN heating and gravity. We conclude that\nSMBH/NSC co-evolution is crucial for the growth of SMBH in high-z galaxies, the\nprogenitors of massive elliptical today.\n", "  We evaluate the electric quadrupole moments of the ${^1}\\!S_0$ and\n${^3}\\!P_0$ clock states of $^{27}$Al$^+$ and $^{115}$In$^+$. To capture all\ndominant contributions, our analysis extends through third order of\nperturbation theory and includes hyperfine coupling of the electrons to both\nthe magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of the nucleus. For\n$^{27}$Al$^+$, a fortuitous cancellation leads to a suppressed frequency shift.\nThis should allow for continued improvement of the clock without special\ntechniques to control or cancel the shift, such as the averaging schemes that\nare critical to other optical ion clocks.\n", "  The coexistence of effects in a certain class of generalized probability\ntheories is investigated. The effect space corresponding to an even-sided\nregular polygon state space has a central hyperplane that contains all the\nnontrivial extremal effects. The existence of such a hyperplane, called a\nreflecting hyperplane, is tightly related to the point symmetry of the\ncorresponding state space. The effects on such a hyperplane can be regarded as\nthe (generalized) unbiased effects. A necessary and sufficient condition for a\npair of unbiased effects in the even-sided regular polygon theories is\npresented. This result reproduces a low-dimensional analogue of known results\nof qubit effects in a certain limit.\n", "  Comparison of three different regularization methods of calculating the\none-loop effective Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian of quantum electro-dynamics\n(QED) is employed to derive some interesting integrals involving the asymptotic\nexpansion of $\\ln \\Gamma_1(x+1)$, the generalized $\\Gamma$ function. Here it is\nthe constant $L_1$ that will enable us to calculate some integrals which are\nuseful in mathematics as well as in physics.\n", "  A possibility of time-delayed radio brightenings of Sgr A* triggered by the\npericenter passage of the G2 cloud is studied by carrying out global\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations taking into account the\nradiative cooling of the tidal debris of the G2 cloud. Magnetic fields in the\naccretion flow are strongly perturbed and re-organized after the passage of G2.\nWe have found that the magnetic energy in the accretion flow increases by a\nfactor 3-4 in 5-10 years after the pericenter passage of G2 by a dynamo\nmechanism driven by the magneto-rotational instability. Since this B-field\namplification enhances the synchrotron emission from the disk and the outflow,\nthe radio and the infrared luminosity of Sgr A* is expected to increase around\nA.D. 2020. The time-delay of the radio brightening enables us to determine the\nrotation axis of the preexisting disk.\n", "  We study quantum aspects of the recently constructed doubly lambda-deformed\nsigma-models representing the effective action of two WZW models interacting\nvia current bilinears. We show that although the exact beta-functions and\ncurrent anomalous dimensions are identical to those of the lambda-deformed\nmodels, this is not true for the anomalous dimensions of generic primary field\noperators in accordance with the fact that the two models differ drastically.\nOur proofs involve CFT arguments, as well as effective sigma-model action and\ngravity calculations.\n", "  We present GPI polarized intensity imagery of HD 100453 in Y-, J-, and K1\nbands which reveals an inner gap ($9 - 18$ au), an outer disk ($18-39$ au) with\ntwo prominent spiral arms, and two azimuthally-localized dark features also\npresent in SPHERE total intensity images (Wagner 2015). SED fitting further\nsuggests the radial gap extends to $1$ au. The narrow, wedge-like shape of the\ndark features appears similar to predictions of shadows cast by a inner disk\nwhich is misaligned with respect to the outer disk. Using the Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer code HOCHUNCK3D (Whitney 2013), we construct a model of the\ndisk which allows us to determine its physical properties in more detail. From\nthe angular separation of the features we measure the difference in inclination\nbetween the disks 45$^{\\circ}$, and their major axes, PA = 140$^{\\circ}$ east\nof north for the outer disk and 100$^{\\circ}$for the inner disk. We find an\nouter disk inclination of $25 \\pm 10^{\\circ}$ from face-on in broad agreement\nwith the Wagner 2015 measurement of 34$^{\\circ}$. SPHERE data in J- and H-bands\nindicate a reddish disk which points to HD 100453 evolving into a young debris\ndisk.\n", "  The term \"long-range interactions\" refers to electrostatic and magnetostatic\npotential energies between atoms and molecules with mutual distances ranging\nfrom a few tens to a few hundreds Bohr radii. The involved energies are much\nsmaller than the usual chemical bond energies. However, they are comparable\nwith the typical kinetic energies of particles in an ultracold gas ($T\\ll 1K$),\nso that the long-range interactions play a central role in its dynamics. The\nprogress of research devoted to ultracold gases shed a new light on the\nwell-established topic of long-range interactions, because: (i) the interacting\natoms and molecules can be prepared in a well-defined quantum (electronic,\nvibrational, rotational, fine or hyper-fine), ground or excited level; and (ii)\nlong-range interactions can be tailored at will using external electromagnetic\nfields.\n  In this chapter, we present the essential concepts and mathematical relations\nto calculate long-range potential energies. We start with deriving the\nmultipolar expansion of the electrostatic interaction energy between classical\ncharge distributions, both in Cartesian coordinates for pedagogical purpose,\nand in spherical coordinates for practical use. Then we combine multipolar\nexpansion and quantum perturbation theory, to obtain the general first- and\nsecond-order energy corrections, including the well-known van der Waals energy.\nWe consider two central examples in the current context of ultracold gases: (i)\na pair of alkali-metal atoms and (ii) a pair of alkali-metal heteronuclear\ndiatomic molecules submitted to an electric field. We highlight the key role of\nthe total angular momenta of the interacting particles and of the complex,\nirrespective of their electronic or nuclear, orbital or spin nature.\n", "  This is the second of a series of papers in which we present a new solution\nto reconcile the prediction of single stellar population (SSP) models with the\nobserved stellar mass-to-light ($M/L$) ratios of globular clusters (GCs) in M31\nand its trend with respect to $\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$. In the present work our focus\nis on the empirical relation between age and metallicity for GCs and its effect\non the $M/L$ ratio. Assuming that there is an anti-correlation between the age\nof M31 GCs and their metallicity, we evolve dynamical SSP models of GCs to\nestablish a relation between the $M/L$ ratio (in the $V$ and $K$ band) and\nmetallicity. We then demonstrate that the established $M/L-\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$\nrelation is in perfect agreement with that of M31 GCs. In our models we\nconsider both the canonical initial mass function (IMF) and the top-heavy IMF\ndepending on cluster birth density and metallicity as derived independently\nfrom Galactic GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies by Marks et al. Our results\nsignify that the combination of the density- and metallicity-dependent\ntop-heavy IMF, the anti-correlation between age and metallicity, stellar\nevolution and standard dynamical evolution yields the best possible agreement\nwith the observed trend of $M/L-\\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ for M31 GCs.\n", "  In contrast to a free electron system, a Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid in a\none dimensional (1D) electron system hosts charge and spin excitations as\nindependent entities. When an electron wave packet is injected into a TL\nliquid, it transforms into wave packets carrying either charge or spin that\npropagate at different group velocities and move away from each other. This\nprocess, known as spin-charge separation, is the hallmark of TL physics. While\nthe existence of these TL eigenmodes has been identified in momentum- or\nfrequency-resolved measurements, their waveforms, which are a direct\nmanifestation of 1D electron dynamics, have been long awaited to be measured.\nIn this study, we present a time domain measurement for the\nspin-charge-separation process in an asymmetric chiral TL liquid comprising\nquantum Hall (QH) edge channels. We measure the waveforms of both charge and\nspin excitations by combining a spin filter with a time-resolved charge\ndetector. Spatial separation of charge- and spin-wave packets over a distance\nexceeding 200 um was confirmed. In addition, we found that the 1D electron\ndynamics can be controlled by tuning the electric environment. These\nexperimental results provide fundamental information about non-equilibrium\nphenomena in actual 1D electron systems.\n", "  We investigated transport, magnetotransport, and broadband optical properties\nof the half-Heusler compound YbPtBi. Hall measurements evidence two types of\ncharge carriers: highly mobile electrons with a temperature-dependent\nconcentration and low-mobile holes; their concentration stays almost constant\nwithin the investigated temperature range from 2.5 to 300 K. The optical\nspectra (10 meV - 2.7 eV) can be naturally decomposed into contributions from\nintra- and interband absorption processes, the former manifesting themselves as\ntwo Drude bands with very different scattering rates, corresponding to the\ncharges with different mobilities. These results of the optical measurements\nallow us to separate the contributions from electrons and holes to the total\nconductivity and to implement a two-channel-conduction model for description of\nthe magnetotransport data. In this approach, the electron and hole mobilities\nare found to be around 50000 and 10 cm$^{2}$/Vs at the lowest temperatures (2.5\nK), respectively.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering describes the ability of one party to\nremotely affect another's state through local measurements. One of the most\ndistinguishable properties of EPR steering is its asymmetric aspect. Steering\ncan work in one direction but fail in the opposite direction. This type of\none-way steering, which is different from the symmetry concepts of entanglement\nand Bell nonlocality, has garnered much interest. However, an experimental\ndemonstration of genuine EPR steering in the simplest scenario, i.e., one that\nemploys two-qubit systems, is still lacking. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate one-way EPR steering with multimeasurement settings for a class of\ntwo-qubit states, which are still one-way steerable even with infinite\nsettings. The steerability is quantified by the steering radius, which\nrepresents a necessary and sufficient steering criterion. The demonstrated\none-way steering in the simplest bipartite quantum system is of fundamental\ninterest and may provide potential applications in one-way quantum information\ntasks.\n", "  By expanding the reduced Pfaffian in the tree level Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY)\nintegrands for Yang-Mills (YM) and nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), we can get the\nBern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators in Del Duca-Dixon-Maltoni (DDM) form\nfor arbitrary number of particles in any spacetime dimensions. In this work, we\ngive a set of very straightforward graphic rules based on spanning trees for a\ndirect evaluation of the BCJ numerators for YM and NLSM. Such rules can be\nderived from the Laplace expansion of the corresponding reduced Pfaffian. For\nYM, the each one of the $(n-2)!$ DDM form BCJ numerators contains exactly\n$(n-1)!$ terms, corresponding to the increasing trees with respect to the color\norder. For NLSM, the number of nonzero numerators is at most $(n-2)!-(n-3)!$,\nless than those of several previous constructions.\n", "  Since the orbital angular momentum (OAM) being investigated intensively in\nthe optical region, there are growing interests in employing OAM to solve the\nproblem in wireless communications as a new method. It is found that the\nindependence between different OAM modes is crucial to wireless communications.\nMotivated by the tremendous potential of OAM in communication systems, we\npropose a novel method to generate vortex beams by spoof surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs). A looped double-layer spoof SPP waveguide is applied to\nrealize the transmission of electromagnetic waves. Beam emitting is\naccomplished through a series of circular patches, whose role is not only the\nradiation units but also resonators giving rise to the phase shifts required by\nthe vortex beam. The proposed method is validated by both numerical calculation\nand experiment. The measured results show that the spoof SPPs are radiated by\nthe circular patches and the vortex beam carrying different OAM modes are\nobserved at different frequencies. This is the first time to generate the OAM\nmodes by spoof SPPs. The proposed method possesses smaller size and is much\neasier to be integrated into integrated circuits. The simple structure and\ndesign procedure make the proposed method promising in future wireless\ncommunication systems.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the local properties\nof graphene. Here, we introduce a method for evaluating unknown strain\nconfigurations and simultaneous doping. It relies on separating the effects of\nhydrostatic strain (peak shift) and shear strain (peak splitting) on the Raman\nspectrum of graphene. The peak shifts from hydrostatic strain and doping are\nseparated with a correlation analysis of the 2D and G frequencies. This enables\nus to obtain the local hydrostatic strain, shear strain and doping without any\nassumption on the strain configuration prior to the analysis. We demonstrate\nour approach for two model cases: Graphene under uniaxial stress on a PMMA\nsubstrate and graphene suspended on nanostructures that induce an unknown\nstrain configuration. We measured $\\omega_\\mathrm{2D}/\\omega_\\mathrm{G} = 2.21\n\\pm 0.05$ for pure hydrostatic strain. Raman scattering with circular\ncorotating polarization is ideal for analyzing strain and doping, especially\nfor weak strain when the peak splitting by shear strain cannot be resolved.\n", "  When overlapping in an optical medium with nonlinear susceptibility, light\nwaves can interact with each other, changing their phases, wavelengths, shapes,\nand so on. Such nonlinear effects, discovered over a half century ago, have\ngiven rise to a breadth of important applications. Applying to\nquantum-mechanical signals, however, they face fundamental challenges arising\nfrom the multimode nature of the interacting electromagnetic fields, such as\nphase noises and Raman scattering. Quantum Zeno blockade allows strong\ninteraction of light waves without them physically overlapping, thus providing\na viable solution for those challenges, as indicated in recent bulk-optics\nexperiments. Here, we report on the observation of quantum Zeno blockade on\nchip, where a light wave is modulated by another in a distinct\n\"interaction-free\" manner. For quantum applications, we also verify its\noperations on a single-photon level. Our results promise a scalable platform\nfor overcoming several grand challenges faced by nonlinear optics and quantum\ninformation processing, enabling, e.g., manipulation and interaction of quantum\nsignals without decoherence.\n", "  We review the DPD sum rules and establish their validity to all orders in\nQCD. This is done using a diagrammatic approach and light-front perturbation\ntheory. In the process we furthermore investigate the QCD evolution of double\nparton distributions and obtain sum rules for $1\\to2$ splitting kernels in\nclose analogy to the DPD sum rules themselves.\n", "  We provide an analytic solution to the coupled-mode equations describing the\nsteady-state of a single periodically-modulated optical resonator driven by a\nmonochromatic input. The phenomenology of this system was qualitatively\nunderstood only in the adiabatic limit, i.e. for low modulation speed. However,\nboth in and out of this regime, we find highly non-trivial effects for specific\nparameters of the modulation. For example, we show complete suppression of the\ntransmission even with zero detuning between the input and the static resonator\nfrequency. We also demonstrate the possibility for complete, lossless frequency\nconversion of the input into the side-band frequencies, as well as for\noptimizing the transmitted signal towards a given target temporal waveform. The\nanalytic results are validated by first-principle simulations.\n", "  The evolution of a solitary wave with very weak nonlinearity which was\noriginally investigated by Miles [4] is revisited. The solution for a\none-dimensional gravity wave in a water of uniform depth is considered. This\nleads to finding the solution to a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation in which\nthe nonlinear term is small. Also considered is the asymptotic solution of the\nlinearized KdV equation both analytically and numerically. As in Miles [4], the\nasymptotic solution of the KdV equation for both linear and weakly nonlinear\ncase is found using the method of inversescattering theory. Additionally\ninvestigated is the analytical solution of viscous-KdV equation which reveals\nthe formation of the Peregrine soliton that decays to the initial sech^2(\\xi)\nsoliton and eventually growing back to a narrower and higher amplitude\nbifurcated Peregrine-type soliton.\n", "  We report using Clarke's concept of generalised differential and a\nmodification of Floquet theory to non-smooth oscillations, the occurrence of\ndiscontinuity induced Hopf bifurcations and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations leading\nto quasiperiodic attractors in a memristive Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua (memristive\nMLC) circuit. The above bifurcations arise because of the fact that a\nmemristive MLC circuit is basically a nonsmooth system by virtue of having a\nmemristive element as its nonlinearity. The switching and modulating properties\nof the memristor which we have considered endow the circuit with two\ndiscontinuity boundaries and multiple equilibrium points as well. As the\nJacobian matrices about these equilibrium points are non-invertible, they are\nnon-hyperbolic, some of these admit local bifurcations as well. Consequently\nwhen these equilibrium points are perturbed, they lose their stability giving\nrise to quasiperiodic orbits. The numerical simulations carried out by\nincorporating proper discontinuity mappings (DMs), such as the Poincar\\'{e}\ndiscontinuity map (PDM) and zero time discontinuity map (ZDM), are found to\nagree well with experimental observations.\n", "  Deep convolutional networks have witnessed unprecedented success in various\nmachine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these\nnetworks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are\nstill significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects\nprior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this\nwork, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum\nphysics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel\ntheoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each\nlayer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.\nSpecifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep\nconvolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave\nfunction, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This\nfacilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined\nquantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate\ncorrelation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a\ndeep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description\nenables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with\nwhich we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep\nnetwork via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the\nunderlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a\nnetwork for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically\nvalidate our findings on more common ConvNets which involve ReLU activations\nand max pooling. Beyond the results described above, the description of a deep\nconvolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the formal\nconnection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are\nbrought forth by this work.\n", "  The presence of multiple ion species can add additional branches to the IAW\ndispersion relation and change the Landau damping significantly. Different IAW\nmodes excited by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and different SBS\nbehaviors in several typical ignition hohlraum plasmas in the high-temperature\nand high-density region have been researched by Vlasov-Maxwell simulation. The\nslow mode in HeH or CH plasmas is the least damped mode and will be excited in\nSBS, while the fast mode in AuB plasmas is the least damped mode and will be\nexcited in SBS. Due to strong Landau damping, the SBS in H or HeH plasmas is\nstrong convective instability, while the SBS in AuB plasmas is absolute\ninstability due to the weak Landau damping. However, although the SBS in CH\nplasmas is weak convective instability in the linear theory, the SBS will\ntransform into absolute instability due to decreasing linear Landau damping by\nparticles trapping. These results give a detail research of the IAW modes\nexcitation and the properties of SBS in different species plasmas, thus\nproviding the possibility of controlling SBS by increasing the linear Landau\ndamping of the IAW by changing ion species.\n", "  Boundary element methods provide powerful techniques for the analysis of\nproblems involving coupled multi-physical response, especially in the linear\ncase for which boundary-only formulations are possible. This paper presents the\nintegral equation formulation for size-dependent linear thermoelastic response\nof solids under steady state conditions. The formulation is based upon\nconsistent couple stress theory, which features a skew-symmetric couple-stress\npseudo-tensor. For general anisotropic thermoelastic material, there is not\nonly thermal strain deformation, but also thermal mean curvature deformation.\nInterestingly, in this size-dependent multi-physics model, the thermal\ngoverning equation is independent of the deformation. However, the mechanical\ngoverning equations depend on the temperature field. First, thermal and\nmechanical weak forms and reciprocal theorems are developed for this general\nsize-dependent thermoelastic theory. Then, an integral equation formulation for\nthe three-dimensional isotropic case is derived, along with the corresponding\nsingular infinite space fundamental solutions or kernel functions. Remarkably,\nfor isotropic materials within this theory, there is no thermal mean curvature\ndeformation, and the thermoelastic effect is solely the result of thermal\nstrain deformation. As a result, the size-dependent behavior is specified\nentirely by a single characteristic length scale parameter, while the thermal\ncoupling is defined in terms of the thermal expansion coefficient, as in the\nclassical theory of steady state isotropic thermoelasticity. This\nsimplification permits the development of the required kernel functions from\npreviously defined fundamental solutions for isotropic media.\n", "  WaveguideQEDoffers the possibility of generating strong coherent atomic\ninteractions either through appropriate atomic configurations in the\ndissipative regime or in the bandgap regime. In this work, we show how to\nharness these interactions in order to herald the generation of highly\nentangled atomic states, which afterwards can be mapped to generate single mode\nmulti-photonic states with high fidelities.Weintroduce two protocols for the\npreparation of the atomic states, we discuss their performance and compare them\nto previous proposals. In particular, we show that one of them reaches high\nprobability of success for systems with many atoms but low Purcell factors.\n", "  It is said that there are no accidents or coincidences in physics. Within the\nminimal standard model combined with general relativity we point out that there\nare three exceptionally-long lifetimes which are consistent with being equal,\nand hence that there are two unexplained coincidences.\n", "  The probability of emission of photons in non-dipole case by channeled\nparticle is calculated. The emission of hard photons with an energy comparable\nto the energy of the incident channeled particle is examined. The calculation\nof the quasi-Bloch energy spectrum of the oriented fast charged particle\nentering the crystal at an angle substantially greater than the Lindhard angle\nis performed. The initial and final spectra of the channeled particle belonging\nto a different set of band wave functions corresponding to different energies\nare used. The processes of the photon generation by the quantum\ncrystal-oriented particle entering into the crystal at an angle both greater\nand smaller than the Lindhard angle are considered on the equal footing. It is\nshown that the spectrum of hard photon emission consists of a set of the\nwell-observed emission lines. The probability of the nondipole photon radiation\nby the channeled particle with the energy within a small solid angle oriented\nalong the propagation direction of the channeling particle is shown to be equal\nto It has been shown that the nondipole processes of the radiation of hard\nphotons by the channeled particles are well observed experimentally.\n", "  Existing FEL facilities often suffer from stability issues: so electron\norbit, transverse electron optics, electron bunch compression and other\nparameters have to be readjusted often to account for drifts in performance of\nvarious components. The tuning procedures typically employed in operation are\noften manual and lengthy. We have been developing a combination of model-free\nand model-based automatic tuning methods to meet the needs of present and\nupcoming XFEL facilities. Our approach has been implemented at FLASH\n\\cite{flash} to achieve automatic SASE tuning using empirical control of orbit,\nelectron optics and bunch compression. In this paper we describe our approach\nto empirical tuning, the software which implements it, and the results of using\nit at FLASH. We also discuss the potential of using machine learning and\nmodel-based techniques in tuning methods.\n", "  The analysis of multiple populations (MPs) in globular clusters, both\nspectroscopically and photometrically, is key in understanding their formation\nand evolution. The relatively narrow Johnson U, F336W, and Stromgren and Sloan\nu filters have been crucial in exhibiting these MPs photometrically, but in\nPaper I we showed that the broader Washington C filter can more efficiently\ndetect MPs in the test case globular cluster NGC 1851. In Paper I we also\ndetected a double MS that has not been detected in previous observations of NGC\n1851. We now match this photometry to NGC 1851's published RGB abundances and\nfind the two RGB branches observed in C generally exhibit different abundance\ncharacteristics in a variety of elements (e.g., Ba, Na, and O) and in CN band\nstrengths, but no single element can define the two RGB branches. However,\nsimultaneously considering [Ba/Fe] or CN strengths with either [Na/Fe], [O/Fe],\nor CN strengths can separate the two photometric RGB branches into two distinct\nabundance groups. Matches of NGC 1851's published SGB and HB abundances to the\nWashington photometry shows consistent characterizations of the MPs, which can\nbe defined as an O-rich/N-normal population and an O-poor/N-rich population.\nPhotometric synthesis for both the Washington C filter and the F336W filter\nfinds that these abundance characteristics, with appropriate variations in He,\ncan reproduce for both filters the photometric observations in both the RGB and\nthe MS. This photometric synthesis also confirms the throughput advantages that\nthe C filter has in detecting MPs.\n", "  The original investigation of Lamb (1932, {\\S}349) for the effect of\nviscosity on monochromatic surface waves is extended to account for\nsecond-order Stokes surface waves on deep water in the presence of surface\ntension. This extension is used to evaluate interfacial impedance for Stokes\nwaves under the assumption that the waves are growing and hence the surface\nwaves are unsteady. Thus, the previous investigation of Sajjadi et al. (2014)\nis further explored in that (i) the surface wave is unsteady and nonlinear, and\n(ii) the effect of the water viscosity, which affects surface stresses, is\ntaken into account. The determination of energy-transfer parameter, from wind\nto waves, are calculated through a turbulence closure model but it is shown the\ncontribution due to turbulent shear flow is some 20% lower than that obtained\npreviously. A derivation leading to an expression for the closed streamlines\n(Kelvin cat-eyes), which arise in the vicinity of the critical height, is found\nfor unsteady surface waves. From this expression it is deduced that as waves\ngrow or decay, the cats-eye are no longer symmetrical. Also investigated is the\nenergy transfer from wind to short Stokes waves through the viscous Reynolds\nstresses in the immediate neighborhood of the water surface. It is shown that\nthe resonance between the Tollmien-Schlichting waves for a given turbulent wind\nvelocity profile and the free-surface Stokes waves give rise to an additional\ncontribution to the growth of nonlinear surface waves.\n", "  Ab initio calculations face the challenge of describing a complex multiscale\nquantum many-body system. The nuclear wave function has both strong short-range\ncorrelations and long-range contributions.\n  Natural orbitals provide a means of adapting the single-particle basis for ab\ninitio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations to better match\nthe many-body wave function. Natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the\none-body density matrix from a calculation using an initial single-particle\nreference basis, such as the traditional harmonic oscillator basis. The natural\norbital basis builds in contributions from high-lying oscillator shells, thus\naccelerating convergence of wave functions, energies, and other observables.\n  The convergence of the ground and excited state energies, radii, and\nelectromagnetic observables of He, Li, and Be isotopes calculated using natural\norbitals in ab initio NCCI calculations is discussed. It is found that\nelectromagnetic observables involving the M1 operator fully converge, while the\ncalculated energies, radii, and observables involving the E2 operator converge\nsignificantly faster with the natural orbital basis than with the harmonic\noscillator basis. The use of infrared (IR) extrapolation schemes with the\nnatural orbital calculations is also explored.\n", "  The detailed mathematical study of the recent paper by Sajjadi, Hunt and\nDrullion (2014) is pre- sented. The mathematical developement considered by\nthem, for unsteady growing monochro- matic waves is also extended to Stokes\nwaves. The present contribution also demonstrates agree- ment with the\npioneering work of Belcher and Hunt (1993) which is valid in the limit of the\ncomplex part of the wave phase speed \\c_i \\downarrow 0. It is further shown\nthat the energy-transfer parameter and the surface shear stress for a Stokes\nwave reverts to a monochromatic wave when the second harmonic is excluded.\nFurthermore, the present theory can be used to estimate the amount of energy\ntransferred to each component of nonlinear surface waves on deep water from a\nturbulent shear flow blowing over it. Finally, it is demonstrated that in the\npresence of turbulent eddy viscosity the Miles (1957) critical layer does not\nplay an important role. Thus, it is concluded that in the limit of zero growth\nrate the effect of the wave growth arises from the elevated critical layer by\nfinite turbulent diffusivity, so that the perturbed flow and the drag force is\ndetermined by the asymmetric and sheltering flow in the surface shear layer and\nits matched interaction with the upper region.\n", "  The radiative lifetime of molecules or atoms can be increased by placing them\nwithin a tuned conductive cavity that inhibits spontaneous emission. This was\nexamined as a possible means of enhancing three-body, singlet-based\nupconversion, known as energy pooling. Achieving efficient upconversion of\nlight has potential applications in the fields of photovoltaics, biofuels, and\nmedicine. The affect of the photonically constrained environment on pooling\nefficiency was quantified using a kinetic model populated with data from\nmolecular quantum electrodynamics, perturbation theory, and ab initio\ncalculations. This model was applied to a system with fluorescein donors and a\nhexabenzocoronene acceptor. Placing the molecules within a conducting cavity\nwas found to increase the efficiency of energy pooling by increasing both the\ndonor lifetime and the acceptor emission rate--i.e. a combination of inhibited\nspontaneous emission and the Purcell effect. A model system with a free-space\npooling efficiency of 23% was found to have an efficiency of 47% in a\nrectangular cavity.\n", "  In this note we present a real tachyon vacuum solution for open bosonic\nstring field theory which does not require computing square roots of states in\nthe wedge algebra. We study its algebraic structure, prove the equation of\nmotion and show that the solution supports no cohomology. Finally we show that\nits energy is in agreement with the value predicted by Sen's conjecture.\n", "  Collective modes manifest themselves in a variety of different physical\nsystems ranging from superconductors to superfluid $^{3}$He. The collective\nmodes are generated via the Higgs-Anderson mechanism that is based on the\nsymmetry breaking double well potential. Recently collective modes were\nexplored in superconducting NbN and InO in the presence of a strong terahertz\nlaser field. In both cases a single collective mode that oscillates with twice\nthe frequency of the superconducting energy gap $\\Delta$ was discovered.\nSuperfluid $^{3}$He is the host for a whole variety of collective modes. In\nparticular, in the superfluid $^{3}$He B-phase, two massive collective modes\nwere found with masses $\\sqrt{{8}/{5}}\\Delta$ and $\\sqrt{{12}/{5}}\\Delta$. We\nshow that for both cases of the superconducting films and for the superfluid\n$^{3}$He B-phase, the collective modes satisfy the Nambu identity that relates\nthe masses of different collective modes to the energy gap parameter $\\Delta$.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the effect of electromagnetic (EM) field on the\ngeneration of 2e-2h states from 1e-2h states. One of the fundamental ways by\nwhich electromagnetic (EM) waves interact with matter is by the generation of\nexcited electronic states. The interaction of EM field with atoms and molecules\nis given by the field-dependent Hamiltonian. Excited states are intrinsically\ntransient in nature because they are not stationary states of the\nfield-dependent Hamiltonian. Consequently, the time-dependent dynamics of\nexcited states depend strongly on the external electromagnetic field. Starting\nwith the 1e-1h excitation in a general many-electron system, the system was\npropagated in time using time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT). The\nexpression for time-dependent transition probability of\n$(1\\mathrm{e}-1\\mathrm{h}) \\rightarrow (2\\mathrm{e}-2\\mathrm{h})$ was evaluated\nfor a given time $t$ up to second-order in TDPT using diagrammatic techniques.\nThe derivation does not assume any a priori approximations to the\nelectron-electron correlation operator and presents the derivation of a\ncomplete set of contributing diagrams associated with the full configuration\ninteraction wave function. The result from this work show that the calculation\nof time-dependent transition probability can be factored into a\ntime-independent and time-dependent components. This is a significant outcome\nfor efficient computation of the time-dependent transition probability because\nit allows for pre-computation of time-independent components before the start\nof the calculations.\n", "  We have introduced evolutionary game dynamics to a one-dimensional\ncellular-automaton to investigate evolution and maintenance of cooperative\navoiding behavior of self-driven particles in bidirectional flow. In our model,\nthere are two kinds of particles, which are right-going particles and\nleft-going particles. They often face opponent particles, so that they swerve\nto the right or left stochastically in order to avoid conflicts. The particles\nreinforce their preferences of the swerving direction after their successful\navoidance. The preference is also weakened by memory-loss effect.\n  Result of our simulation indicates that cooperative avoiding behavior is\nachieved, i.e., swerving directions of the particles are unified, when the\ndensity of particles is close to 1/2 and the memory-loss rate is small.\nFurthermore, when the right-going particles occupy the majority of the system,\nwe observe that their flow increases when the number of left-going particles,\nwhich prevent the smooth movement of right-going particles, becomes large. It\nis also investigated that the critical memory-loss rate of the cooperative\navoiding behavior strongly depends on the size of the system. Small system can\nprolong the cooperative avoiding behavior in wider range of memory-loss rate\nthan large system.\n", "  Shape memory alloys are known to memorise one -or several- temperatures at\nwhich the martensite-austenite transformation was stopped before completion in\nthe past, the memory manifesting as specific dips in subsequent calorimetric\nscans. Previous studies have shown that this memory can be erased by heating to\nhigher temperatures than the ones previously recorded. In this paper, we study\na distinct memory fading effect which takes place by heating to a lower\ntemperature. This effect is reported in NiFeGa as polycrystalline ribbons, the\nalloy being initially studied as bulk for which the thermal memory effect was\nnot found. If, after an initial incomplete heating up to T1 one performs a\nsecond incomplete heating up to T2<T1, a new calorimetric dip appears at T2, as\nexpected, while less expected was that the dip corresponding to T1 reduces in\namplitude or even vanishes (if the arrest at T2 is repeated). The memory fading\neffect is more clear for small differences T1-T2 and less obvious or absent for\nlarge ones. The second part of the paper employs a statistical 2D model, which\nassociates the memorized temperatures with a depletion of certain martensite\nplates sizes, and also supports the memory fading effect.\n", "  Unrevealing local magnetic and electronic correlations in the vicinity of\ncharge carriers is crucial in order to understand rich physical properties in\ncorrelated electron systems. Here, using high-energy optical conductivity (up\nto 35 eV) as a function of temperature and polarization, we observe a\nsurprisingly strong spin polarization of the local spin singlet with enhanced\nferromagnetic correlations between Cu spins near the doped holes in lightly\nhole-doped La$_{1.95}$Sr$_{0.05}$Cu$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$O$_{4}$. The changes of\nthe local spin polarization manifest strongly in the temperature-dependent\noptical conductivity at ~7.2 eV, with an anomaly at the magnetic stripe phase\n(~25 K), accompanied by anomalous spectral-weight transfer in a broad energy\nrange. Supported by theoretical calculations, we also assign high-energy\noptical transitions and their corresponding temperature dependence,\nparticularly at ~2.5 ~8.7, ~9.7, ~11.3 and ~21.8 eV. Our result shows the\nimportance of a strong mixture of spin singlet and triplet states in hole-doped\ncuprates and demonstrates a new strategy to probe local magnetic correlations\nusing high- energy optical conductivity in correlated electron systems.\n", "  We study the quantum phase transitions in the nickel pnctides,\nCeNi$_{2-\\delta}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ ($\\delta$ $\\approx$ 0.07-0.22). This\nseries displays the distinct heavy fermion behavior in the rarely studied\nparameter regime of dilute carrier limit. We systematically investigate the\nmagnetization, specific heat and electrical transport down to low temperatures.\nUpon increasing the P-content, the antiferromagnetic order of the Ce-4$f$\nmoment is suppressed continuously and vanishes at $x_c \\sim$ 0.55. At this\ndoping, the temperature dependences of the specific heat and longitudinal\nresistivity display non-Fermi liquid behavior. Both the residual resistivity\n$\\rho_0$ and the Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma_0$ are sharply peaked around\n$x_c$. When the P-content reaches close to 100\\%, we observe a clear\nlow-temperature crossover into the Fermi liquid regime. In contrast to what\nhappens in the parent compound $x$ = 0.0 as a function of pressure, we find a\nsurprising result that the non-Fermi liquid behavior persists over a nonzero\nrange of doping concentration, $x_c<x<0.9$. In this doping range, at the lowest\nmeasured temperatures, the temperature dependence of the specific-heat\ncoefficient is logarithmically divergent and that of the electrical resistivity\nis linear. We discuss the properties of\nCeNi$_{2-\\delta}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ in comparison with those of its 1111\ncounterpart, CeNi(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)O. Our results indicate a non-Fermi liquid\nphase in the global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.\n", "  The quest towards expansion of the MAX design space has been accelerated with\nthe recent discovery of several solid solution and ordered phases involving at\nleast two MAX end members. Going beyond the nominal MAX compounds enables not\nonly fine tuning of existing properties but also entirely new functionality.\nThis search, however, has been mostly done through painstaking experiments as\nknowledge of the phase stability of the relevant systems is rather scarce. In\nthis work, we report the first attempt to evaluate the finite-temperature\npseudo-binary phase diagram of the Ti2AlC-Cr2AlC via first-principles-guided\nBayesian CALPHAD framework that accounts for uncertainties not only in ab\ninitio calculations and thermodynamic models but also in synthesis conditions\nin reported experiments. The phase stability analyses are shown to have good\nagreement with previous experiments. The work points towards a promising way of\ninvestigating phase stability in other MAX Phase systems providing the\nknowledge necessary to elucidate possible synthesis routes for MAX systems with\nunprecedented properties.\n", "  In this paper we discuss some properties of linear fractional dispersive\nwaves. In particular, we compare the dispersion relations emerging from the\nkinematic wave equation and from the linearised Korteweg - de Vries equation\nwith the corresponding time-fractionalized versions. For this purpose, we\nevaluate the expressions for the phase velocity and for the group velocity,\nhighlighting the differences not only analytically, but also by means of\nilluminating plots.\n", "  Primary cosmic-ray elemental spectra have been measured with the\nballoon-borne Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass (CREAM) experiment since 2004. The\nthird CREAM payload (CREAM-III) flew for 29 days during the 2007-2008 Antarctic\nseason. Energies of incident particles above 1 TeV are measured with a\ncalorimeter. Individual elements are clearly separated with a charge resolution\nof ~0.12 e (in charge units) and ~0.14 e for protons and helium nuclei,\nrespectively, using two layers of silicon charge detectors. The measured proton\nand helium energy spectra at the top of the atmosphere are harder than other\nexisting measurements at a few tens of GeV. The relative abundance of protons\nto helium nuclei is 9.53+-0.03 for the range of 1 TeV/n to 63 TeV/n. The ratio\nis considerably smaller than other measurements at a few tens of GeV/n. The\nspectra become softer above ~20 TeV. However, our statistical uncertainties are\nlarge at these energies and more data are needed.\n", "  Discussion about the nature of zebra-structure (ZS) in the type IV radio\nbursts continues, despite the ten proposed models. First of all, this is due to\nthe wide variety of stripes in each new phenomenon, when the explanation of all\nthe fine details by any one mechanism becomes impossible. The most widespread\nexplanation is the emission at different levels of double plasma resonance\n(DPR), sequential on the height surfaces in the magnetic trap, where the upper\nhybrid frequency ($\\omega_{UH}$) becomes equal to the integer of electronic\ncyclotron harmonics $s\\omega_{Be}: \\omega_{UH} = (\\omega_{Pe}^2 +\n\\omega_{Be}^2)^{1/2} = s\\omega_{Be}$ (Zheleznyakov, Zlotnik, 1975, Winglee,\nDulk, 1986, Kuznetsov & Tsap (2007)). An important alternative mechanism is the\ninteraction of plasma waves with the whistlers: $l + w \\Rightarrow t$ (Chernov,\n1976, 2006). Here, we will show the possibility of explaining the main features\nof the zebra stripes in the model with whistlers, using the example of the\nphenomenon on August 1, 2010.\n", "  This paper presents an alternative way to the dynamic modeling of a\nrotational inverted pendulum using the classic mechanics known as\nEuler-Lagrange allows to find motion equations that describe our model. It also\nhas a design of the basic model of the system in SolidWorks software, which\nbased on the material and dimensions of the model provides some physical\nvariables necessary for modeling. In order to verify the theoretical results,\nIt was made a contrast between the solutions obtained by simulation\nSimMechanics-Matlab and the system of equations Euler-Lagrange, solved through\nODE23tb method included in Matlab bookstores for solving equations systems of\nthe type and order obtained. This article comprises a pendulum trajectory\nanalysis by a phase space diagram that allows the identification of stable and\nunstable regions of the system.\n", "  Solitons are of the important significant in many fields of nonlinear science\nsuch as nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, plamas physics, biology,\nfluid mechanics, and etc.. The stable solitons have been captured not only\ntheoretically and experimentally in both linear and nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS)\nequations in the presence of non-Hermitian potentials since the concept of the\nparity-time (PT)-symmetry was introduced in 1998. In this paper, we present\nnovel bright solitons of the NLS equation with third-order dispersion in some\ncomplex PT-symmetric potentials (e.g., physically relevant PT-symmetric\nScarff-II-like and harmonic-Gaussian potentials). We find stable nonlinear\nmodes even if the respective linear PT-symmetric phases are broken. Moreover,\nwe also use the adiabatic changes of the control parameters to excite the\ninitial modes related to exact solitons to reach stable nonlinear modes. The\nelastic interactions of two solitons are exhibited in the third-order NLS\nequation with PT-symmetric potentials. Our results predict the dynamical\nphenomena of soliton equations in the presence of third-order dispersion and\nPT-symmetric potentials arising in nonlinear fiber optics and other physically\nrelevant fields.\n", "  The novel nonlinear dispersive Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) mean-field model with\nthe space-modulated nonlinearity and potential (called GP(m, n) equation) is\ninvestigated in this paper. By using self-similar transformations and some\npowerful methods, we obtain some families of novel envelope compacton-like\nsolutions spikon-like solutions to the GP(n, n) (n>1) equation. These solutions\npossess abundant localized structures because of infinite choices of the\nself-similar function X(x). In particular, we choose X(x) as the Jacobi\namplitude function am(x,k) and the combination of linear and trigonometric\nfunctions of space x so that the novel localized structures of the GP(2,2)\nequation are illustrated, which are much different from the usual compacton and\nspikon solutions reported. Moreover, it is shown that GP(m,1) equation with\nlinear dispersion also admits the compacton-like solutions for the case 0<m<1\nand spikon-like solutions for the case m<0.\n", "  We present the X-ray light curves of the last two outbursts --2014 & 2016--\nof the well known accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) Aquila X-1 using\nthe monitor of all sky X-ray image (MAXI) observations in the $2-20$ keV band.\nAfter calibrating the (MAXI) count rates to the all-sky monitor (ASM) level, we\nreport that the 2016 outburst is the most energetic event of Aql X-1, ever\nobserved from this source. We show that 2016 outburst is a member of the\nlong-high class according to the classification presented by G\\\"ung\\\"or et al.\nwith $\\sim68$ cnt/s maximum flux and $\\sim60$ days duration time and the\nprevious outburst, 2014, belongs to the short-low class with $\\sim 25$ cnt/s\nmaximum flux and $\\sim 30$ days duration time. In order to understand\ndifferences between outbursts, we investigate the possible dependence of the\npeak intensity to the quiescent duration leading to the outburst and find that\nthe outbursts following longer quiescent episodes tend to reach higher peak\nenergetic.\n", "  For every finite dimensional Lie group one can consider the group of all\nsmooth loops on it, called its loop group. Such loop groups have long been\nstudied for, among other reasons, their relations to conformal field theories\nand topological quantum field theories. In this thesis we introduce a new\ngeneralisation of the loop groups associated to tori, which we name bicoloured\ntorus loop groups. An element of such a group consists mainly of two paths,\neach lying on two (possibly different) fixed tori. The definition of the group\nadditionally imposes a constraint on the endpoints of these paths with respect\nto each other. We study these bicoloured torus loop groups by demonstrating\nthat they have a theory analogous to that of ordinary torus loop groups. We\nnamely construct certain central extensions of them by the group $\\mathrm U(1)$\nand prove that they have many properties in common with specific, known,\ncentral extensions of ordinary loop groups. Notably, we are able to construct\nand classify the irreducible, positive energy representations of these\nextensions.\n", "  The realization of quantum computers and quantum Internet requires not only\nquantum gates and quantum memories, but also transistors at single-photon\nlevels to control the flow of information encoded on single photons.\nSingle-photon transistor (SPT) is an optical transistor in the quantum limit,\nwhich uses a single photon to open or block a photonic channel. In sharp\ncontrast to all previous SPT proposals which are based on single-photon\nnonlinearities, here I present a novel design for a high-gain and high-speed\n(up to THz) SPT based on a linear optical effect - giant circular birefringence\n(GCB) induced by a single spin in a double-sided optical microcavity. A gate\nphoton sets the spin state via projective measurement and controls the light\npropagation in the optical channel. This spin-cavity transistor can be directly\nconfigured as diodes, routers, DRAM units, switches, modulators, etc. Due to\nthe duality as quantum gate and transistor, the spin-cavity unit provides a\nsolid-state platform ideal for future Internet - a mixture of all-optical\nInternet with quantum Internet.\n", "  Current data broadly support trends of galaxy surface brightness profile\namplitude and shape with total stellar mass predicted by state-of-the-art\nLambda-CDM cosmological simulations, although recent results show signs of\ninteresting discrepancies, particularly for galaxies less massive than the\nMilky Way. Here I discuss how perhaps the largest contribution to such\ndiscrepancies can be inferred almost directly from how well a given model\nagrees with the observed present-day galaxy stellar mass function.\n", "  We present a new experimental set-up that creates a shear flow with zero mean\nadvection velocity achieved by counterbalancing the nonzero streamwise pressure\ngradient by moving boundaries, which generates plane Couette-Poiseuille flow.\nWe carry out the first experimental results in the transitional regime for this\nflow. Using flow visualization we characterize the subcritical transition to\nturbulence in Couette-Poiseuille flow and show the existence of turbulent spots\ngenerated by a permanent perturbation. Due to the zero mean advection velocity\nof the base profile, these turbulent structures are nearly stationary. We\ndistinguish two regions of the turbulent spot: the active, turbulent core,\nwhich is characterized by waviness of the streaks similar to traveling waves,\nand the surrounding region, which includes in addition the weak undisturbed\nstreaks and oblique waves at the laminar-turbulent interface. We also study the\ndependence of the size of these two regions on Reynolds number. Finally, we\nshow that the traveling waves move in the downstream (Poiseuille).\n", "  Quantum bits have technological imperfections. Additionally, the capacity of\na component that can be implemented feasibly is limited. Therefore, distributed\nquantum computation is required to scale up quantum computers.\n  This dissertation presents a new quantum computer architecture which takes\ninto account imperfections, aimed to realize distributed computation by\nconnecting quantum computers each of which consists of multiple quantum CPUs\nand memories. Quantum CPUs employ a quantum error correcting code which has\nfaster logical gates and quantum memories employ a code which is superior in\nspace resource requirements.\n  This dissertation focuses on quantum error correcting codes, giving a\npractical, concrete method for tolerating static losses such as faulty devices\nfor the surface code. Numerical simulation with practical assumptions showed\nthat a yield of functional qubits of 90% is marginally capable of building\nlarge-scale systems, by culling the poorer 50% of lattices during\npost-fabrication testing. Yield 80% is not usable even when culling 90% of\ngenerated lattices.\n  For internal connections in a quantum computer and for connections between\nquantum computers, this dissertation gives a fault-tolerant method that bridges\nheterogeneous quantum error correcting codes. Numerical simulation showed that\nthe scheme, which discards any quantum state in which any error is detected,\nalways achieves an adequate logical error rate regardless of physical error\nrates in exchange for increased resource consumption.\n  This dissertation gives a new extension of the surface code suitable for\nmemories. This code is shown to require fewer physical qubits to encode a\nlogical qubit than conventional codes. This code achieves the reduction of 50%\nphysical qubits per a logical qubit.\n  Collectively, the elements to propose the distributed quantum computer\narchitecture are brought together.\n", "  Solar-mass stars form via circumstellar disk accretion (disk-mediated\naccretion). Recent findings indicate that this process is likely episodic in\nthe form of accretion bursts, possibly caused by disk fragmentation. Although\nit cannot be ruled out that high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs; $M>$8\nM$_\\odot$, $L_{bol}>$5$\\times$10$^3$ L$_\\odot$) arise from the coalescence of\ntheir low-mass brethren, latest results suggest that they more likely form via\ndisks. Accordingly, disk-mediated accretion bursts should occur. Here we report\non the discovery of the first disk-mediated accretion burst from a $\\sim$20\nM$_\\odot$ HMYSO. Our near-infrared images show the brightening of the central\nsource and its outflow cavities. Near-infrared spectroscopy reveals emission\nlines typical of accretion bursts in low-mass protostars, but orders of\nmagnitude more luminous. Moreover, the energy released and the inferred\nmass-accretion rate are also orders of magnitude larger. Our results identify\ndisk accretion as the common mechanism of star formation across the entire\nstellar mass spectrum.\n", "  The Fermi bubbles are one of the most remarkable features in the gamma-ray\nsky revealed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). The nature of the\ngamma-ray emission and the origin of the bubbles are still open questions. In\nthis note, we will review some basic features of leptonic and hadronic modes of\ngamma-ray production. At the moment, gamma rays are our best method to study\nthe bubbles, but in order to resolve the origin of the bubbles multi-wavelength\nand multi-messenger observations will be crucial.\n", "  An extension to the classical FPV model is developed for transcritical\nreal-fluid combustion simulations in the context of finite volume, fully\ncompressible, explicit solvers. A double-flux model is developed for\ntranscritical flows to eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations. A hybrid\nscheme with entropy-stable flux correction is formulated to robustly represent\nlarge density ratios. The thermodynamics for ideal-gas values is modeled by a\nlinearized specific heat ratio model. Parameters needed for the cubic EoS are\npre-tabulated for the evaluation of departure functions and a quadratic\nexpression is used to recover the attraction parameter. The novelty of the\nproposed approach lies in the ability to account for pressure and temperature\nvariations from the baseline table. Cryogenic LOX/GH2 mixing and reacting cases\nare performed to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in\nmultidimensional simulations. The proposed combustion model and numerical\nschemes are directly applicable for LES simulations of real applications under\ntranscritical conditions.\n", "  This comment about the article \"Hamiltonian for the Zeros of the Riemann Zeta\nFunction\", by C. M. Bender, D. C. Brody, and M. P. M\\\"uller, published recently\nin Phys. Rev. Lett. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 118, 130201, (2017)) gives arguments\nshowing that the strategy proposed by the authors to prove the Riemann\nHypothesis, does not actually work.\n", "  The graphene/MoS2 heterojunction formed by joining the two components\nlaterally in a single plane promises to exhibit a low-resistance contact\naccording to the Schottky-Mott rule. Here we provide an atomic-scale\ndescription of the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of this type\nof junction. We first identify the energetically favorable structures in which\nthe preference of forming C-S or C-Mo bonds at the boundary depends on the\nchemical conditions. We find that significant charge transfer between graphene\nand MoS2 is localized at the boundary. We show that the abundant 1D boundary\nstates substantially pin the Fermi level in the lateral contact between\ngraphene and MoS2, in close analogy to the effect of 2D interfacial states in\nthe contacts between 3D materials. Furthermore, we propose specific ways in\nwhich these effects can be exploited to achieve spin-polarized currents.\n", "  Viscous flows in a quasi-two-dimensional Hele-Shaw geometry can lead to an\ninterfacial instability when one fluid, of viscosity $\\eta_{in}$ displaces\nanother of higher viscosity, $\\eta_{out}$. Recent studies have shown that there\nis a delay in the onset of fingering in miscible fluids as the viscosity ratio,\n$\\eta_{in}/\\eta_{out}$, increases and approaches unity; the interface can\nremain stable even though the displacing liquid is less viscous. This paper\nshows that a delayed onset and stable pattern can occur in immiscible fluids as\nwell. However, there are two significant differences between the two cases.\nFirst, in miscible fluids, stable patterns are obtained whenever\n$\\eta_{in}/\\eta_{out} > 0.33$ while in immiscible fluids, the radius at which\nthe onset of fingering starts, $R_{onset}$, increases steadily until\n$\\eta_{in}/\\eta_{out}=1$. A stable pattern is obtained only when the total size\nof the plate used is smaller than $R_{onset}$. Second, once the delayed\nfingering starts in immiscible fluids, the fingers grow faster than the central\ncircular region. In miscible fluids, there is a regime in which the fingers and\nthe central region grow in proportion to each other. These differences between\nmiscible and immiscible fingering are maintained even when we compare\nimmiscible fluids that have very low interfacial tension with miscible fluids\nthat have negligible diffusion.\n", "  We present a CO(2-1) mosaic map of the spiral galaxy NGC 6946 by combining\ndata from the Submillimeter Array and the IRAM 30 m telescope. We identify 390\ngiant molecular clouds (GMCs) from the nucleus to 4.5 kpc in the disk. GMCs in\nthe inner 1 kpc are generally more luminous and turbulent, some of which have\nluminosities >10^6 K km/s pc^2 and velocity dispersions >10 km/s. Large-scale\nbar-driven dynamics likely regulate GMC properties in the nuclear region.\nSimilar to the Milky Way and other disk galaxies, GMC mass function of NGC 6946\nhas a shallower slope (index>-2) in the inner region, and a steeper slope\n(index<-2) in the outer region. This difference in mass spectra may be\nindicative of different cloud formation pathways: gravitational instabilities\nmight play a major role in the nuclear region, while cloud coalescence might be\ndominant in the outer disk. Finally, the NGC 6946 clouds are similar to those\nin M33 in terms of statistical properties, but they are generally less luminous\nand turbulent than the M51 clouds.\n", "  The orbital susceptibility for graphene is calculated exactly up to the first\norder with respect to the overlap integrals between neighboring atomic\norbitals. The general and rigorous theory of orbital susceptibility developed\nin the preceding paper is applied to a model for graphene as a typical two-band\nmodel. It is found that there are contributions from interband, Fermi surface,\nand occupied states in addition to the Landau--Peierls orbital susceptibility.\nThe relative phase between the atomic orbitals on the two sublattices related\nto the chirality of Dirac cones plays an important role. It is shown that there\nare some additional contributions to the orbital susceptibility that are not\nincluded in the previous calculations using the Peierls phase in the\ntight-binding model for graphene. The physical origin of this difference is\nclarified in terms of the corrections to the Peierls phase.\n", "  We investigate the nonclassicality of an open quantum system using\nLeggett-Garg inequality (LGI) which test the correlations of a single system\nmeasured at different times. Violation of LGI implies nonclassical behavior of\nthe open system. We investigate the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality\nfor a two level system (qubit) spontaneously decaying under a general\nnon-Markovian dissipative environment. Our results are exact as we have\ncalculated the two-time correlation functions exactly for a wide range of\nsystem-environment parameters beyond Born-Markov regime.\n", "  This document is devoted to the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Forward\nSpectrometer and describes the design considerations, the technical layout, the\nexpected performance, and the production readiness.\n", "  We investigate spacing statistics $p(s)$ and distribution of eigenvalues\n$D(\\epsilon)$ for ensembles of various real random matrices (of order $n \\times\nn, n=2$ and $n>>2$) where the matrix-elements have various Probability\nDistribution Function (PDF: $f(x)$) including Gaussian. We construct ensembles\nof $1000$, $100 \\times 100$ real random matrices $R$, $C$ (cyclic) and $T$\n(tridiagonal) and real symmetric matrices: ${\\cal R}'$, ${\\cal R}=R+R^t$,\n${\\cal Q}=RR^t$, ${\\cal C}$ (cyclic), ${\\cal T}$ (tridiagonal), $T'$\n(pseudo-symmetric Tridiagonal), $\\Theta$ (Toeplitz) , ${\\cal D}=CC^t$ and\n${\\cal S}=TT^t$. We find that the spacing distribution of the adjacent levels\nof matrices ${\\cal R}$ and ${\\cal R}'$ under any symmetric PDF of matrix\nelements is $p_{AB}(s)=A s e^{-Bs^2}$ which approximately conforms to the\nWigner surmise as $A/2 \\approx B \\approx \\pi/4$. But under asymmetric PDFs we\nobserve $A/2 \\approx B >>\\pi/4$, where $A,B$ are also sensitive to the choice\nof the matrix and the PDF. More interestingly, the real symmetric matrices\n${\\cal C}, {\\cal T}, {\\cal Q}$, $\\Theta$ (excepting ${\\cal D}$ and ${\\cal S}$)\nand $T'$ (pseudo-symmetric tridiagonal) all conform to the Poisson distribution\n$p_{\\mu}(s) =\\mu e^{-\\mu s}$, where $\\mu$ depends upon the choice of the matrix\nand PDF. Let complex eigenvalues of $R$, $C$ and $T$ be $E^c_n$. We show that\nall $p(s)$ arising due to $\\Re(E^c_n)$, $\\Im(E^c_n)$ and $|E^c_n|$ of $R$, $C$\nand $T$ are also of Poisson type: $\\mu e^{-\\mu s}$. We observe $p(s)$ as\nhalf-Gaussian for two real eigenvalues of $C$. For real matrices $R, C, T$, we\nassociate new types of $p(s)$ with them. Lastly, we study the distribution\n$D(\\epsilon)$ of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices (of large order) discussed\nabove.\n", "  We present the results of a Spitzer/Herschel infrared photometric analysis of\nthe largest (716) and highest-redshift (z=1.8) sample of Brightest Cluster\nGalaxies (BCGs), those from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster\nSurvey (SpARCS). Given the tension that exists between model predictions and\nrecent observations of BCGs at z<2, we aim to uncover the dominant physical\nmechanism(s) guiding the stellar-mass buildup of this special class of\ngalaxies, the most massive in the Universe uniquely residing at the centres of\ngalaxy clusters. Through a comparison of their stacked, broadband, infrared\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a variety of SED model templates in the\nliterature, we identify the major sources of their infrared energy output, in\nmultiple redshift bins between 0 < z < 1.8. We derive estimates of various BCG\nphysical parameters from the stacked {\\nu}L{\\nu} SEDs, from which we infer a\nstar-forming, as opposed to a 'red and dead' population of galaxies, producing\ntens to hundreds of solar masses per year down to z=0.5. This discovery\nchallenges the accepted belief that BCGs should only passively evolve through a\nseries of gas-poor, minor mergers since z~4 (De Lucia & Blaizot 2007), but\nagrees with the improved semi-analytic model of hierarchical structure\nformation of Tonini et al. (2012), which predicts star-forming BCGs throughout\nthe epoch considered. We attribute the star formation inferred from the stacked\ninfrared SEDs to both major and minor 'wet' (gas-rich) mergers, based on a lack\nof key signatures (to date) of the cluster cooling flows to which BCG star\nformation is typically attributed, as well as a number of observational and\nsimulation-based studies that support this scenario.\n", "  Electrostatic interactions play crucial roles in biophysical processes such\nas protein folding and molecular recognition. Poisson-Boltzmann equation\n(PBE)-based models have emerged as widely used in modeling these important\nprocesses. Though great efforts have been put into developing efficient PBE\nnumerical models, challenges still remain due to the high dimensionality of\ntypical biomolecular systems. In this study, we implemented and analyzed\ncommonly used linear PBE solvers for the ever-improving graphics processing\nunits (GPU) for biomolecular simulations, including both standard and\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (CG) solvers with several alternative\npreconditioners. Our implementation utilizes standard Nvidia CUDA libraries\ncuSPARSE, cuBLAS, and CUSP. Extensive tests show that good numerical accuracy\ncan be achieved given that the single precision is often used for numerical\napplications on GPU platforms. The optimal GPU performance was observed with\nthe Jacobi-preconditioned CG solver, with a significant speedup over standard\nCG solver on CPU in our diversified test cases. Our analysis further shows that\ndifferent matrix storage formats also considerably affect the efficiency of\ndifferent linear PBE solvers on GPU, with the diagonal format best suited for\nour standard finite-difference linear systems. Further efficiency may be\npossible with matrix-free operations and integrated grid stencil setup\nspecifically tailored for the banded matrices in PBE-specific linear systems.\n", "  Forthcoming applications in electronics and optoelectronics make phosphorene\na subject of vigorous research efforts. Solvent-assisted exfoliation of\nphosphorene promises affordable delivery in industrial quantities for future\napplications. We demonstrate, using equilibrium, steered and umbrella sampling\nmolecular dynamics, that the 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate\n[EMIM][BF4] ionic liquid is an excellent solvent for phosphorene exfoliation.\nThe presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, as well as\nsubstantial shear viscosity, allows [EMIM][BF4] simultaneously to facilitate\nseparation of phosphorene sheets and to protect them from getting in direct\ncontact with moisture and oxygen. The exfoliation thermodynamics is moderately\nunfavorable, indicating that an external stimulus is necessary. Unexpectedly,\n[EMIM][BF4] does not coordinates phosphorene by p-electron stacking with the\nimidazole ring. Instead, the solvation proceeds via hydrophobic side chains,\nwhile polar imidazole rings form an electrostatically stabilized protective\nlayer. The simulations suggest that further efforts in solvent engineering for\nphosphorene exfoliation should concentrate on use of weakly coordinating ions\nand grafting groups that promote stronger dispersion interactions, and on\nelongation of nonpolar chains.\n", "  A first-principle study of the formation and migration of native defects in\nLiH, a material of interest in hydrogen storage and lithium-ion batteries, has\nrecently been published. Their results are found here to be of key-importance\nto deduce useful results for the pressure dependence of the ionic conductivity\nof LiH.\n", "  Very recent measurements of the electrical conductivity of solid systems AgX\n- CdX$_2$ (where X$\\equiv$Cl,Br) that form large areas of solid solutions, have\nshown that maximum conductivity occurs for a concentration around 20 mol\\% of\nthe cadmium halide. Here, we suggest a quantitative explanation of this\nphenomenon based on a model that was suggested (J. Appl. Phys. 103, 083552,\n(2008)) for estimating the compressibility of multiphased mixed crystals. In\naddition, explicit conditions are obtained which predict when such a\nconductivity maximum is expected to occur.\n", "  Elasticity of soft materials can be greatly influenced by the presence of air\nbubbles. Such a capillary effect is expected for a wide range of materials,\nfrom polymer gels to concentrated emulsions and colloidal suspensions. Whereas\nexperimental results and theory exist for describing the elasto-capillary\nbehavior of bubbly materials (i.e. with moderate gas volume fractions), foamy\nsystems still require a dedicated study in order to increase our understanding\nof elasticity in aerated materials over the full range of gas volume fractions.\nHere we elaborate well-controlled foams with concentrated emulsion and we\nmeasure their shear elastic modulus as a function of gas fraction, bubble size\nand elastic modulus of the emulsion. Such complex foams possess the elastic\nfeatures of both the bubble assembly and the interstitial matrix. Moreover,\ntheir elastic modulus is shown to be governed by two parameters, namely the gas\nvolume fraction and the elasto-capillary number, defined as the ratio of the\nemulsion modulus with the bubble capillary pressure. We connect our results for\nfoams with existing data for bubbly systems and we provide a general view for\nthe effect of gas bubbles in soft elastic media. Finally, we suggest that our\nresults could be useful for estimating the shear modulus of aqueous foams and\nemulsions with multimodal size distributions.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the interfaces in FK Ising model in any domain\nwith 4 marked boundary points and wired--free--wired--free boundary conditions\nconditioned on a specific internal arc configuration of interfaces converge in\nthe scaling limit to hypergeometric SLE (hSLE). The arc configuration consists\nof a pair of interfaces and the scaling limit of their joint law can be\ndescribed by an algorithm to sample the pair from a hSLE curve and a chordal\nSLE (in a random domain defined by the hSLE).\n", "  Various experimental techniques, have revealed that the predominant intrinsic\npoint defects in BaF$_2$ are anion Frenkel defects. Their formation enthalpy\nand entropy as well as the corresponding parameters for the fluorine vacancy\nand fluorine interstitial motion have been determined. In addition, low\ntemperature dielectric relaxation measurements in BaF$_2$ doped with uranium\nleads to the parameters {\\tau}$_0$, E in the Arrhenius relation\n{\\tau}={\\tau}$_0$exp(E/kBT) for the relaxation time {\\tau}. For the relaxation\npeak associated with a single tetravalent uranium, the migration entropy\ndeduced from the pre-exponential factor {\\tau}$_0$, is smaller than the anion\nFrenkel defect formation entropy by almost two orders of magnitude. We show\nthat, despite their great variation, the defect entropies and enthalpies are\ninterconnected through a model based on anharmonic properties of the bulk\nmaterial that have been recently studied by employing density-functional theory\nand density-functional perturbation theory.\n", "  The existence of ferroelectricity in {$\\mathrm{BiMnO}_3$} has been a\nlong-standing question for both experimentalists and theorists. In addition to\na highly distorted bulk structure, the ionic crystal planes cause a large\nroughness in thin films that makes it extremely difficult to nail down the\nphysical mechanisms underlying a possible ferroelectric-ferromagnetic phase. We\napproach the problem by including the substrate explicitly to study the\npolarization. With this model, we investigate mono-, di-, and trilayer\n{$\\mathrm{BiMnO}_3$} thin films on $\\mathrm{SrTiO}_3$ substrates. We find that\nthin film systems have both strong ferromagnetism and strong ferroelectricity.\nSubstrate constraints weaken the competition between displacements induced by\nstereochemically active Bi-$6s^2$ lone pairs and by Jahn-Teller distortions\naround Mn ions found in the bulk, such that the sum of off-center displacements\nof Bi ions in bulk {$\\mathrm{BiMnO}_3$} nearly cancel. In {$\\mathrm{BiMnO}_3$}\nthin films, in contrast, all Bi ions displace roughly in parallel, resulting in\na strongly polar structure. We also find spontaneous charge disproportionation\nof Mn ion pairs in {$\\mathrm{BiMnO}_3$} thin films.\n", "  Using coherent states in optical quantum process tomography is a\npractically-relevant approach. Here, we develop a framework for complete\ncharacterization of quantum-optical processes in terms of normally-ordered\nmoments by using coherent states as probes. We derive the associated\nsuperoperator tensors for several optical processes. We also show that our\ntechnique can be used to determine nonclassicality features of quantum-optical\nstates and processes. Furthermore, we investigate identification of multi-mode\nGaussian processes and show that the number of necessary probe coherent states\nscales linearly with the number of modes.\n", "  We show that the defect data parameters related to various defect processes,\ne.g., formation, migration, dielectric relaxation parameters, obey a universal\nlaw. In particular, the defect entropies scale with the defect enthalpies\nirrespective of the process considered. A concrete example is given here for\nSrF$_2$ by considering the dielectric relaxation parameters (R$_1$ relaxation\nmechanism) for crystals doped with trivalent ions of Ce, Eu and Gd, parameters\nfor the anion Frenkel formation as well as for the migration of anion vacancy\nand the anion interstitial motion.\n", "  Besides purely academic interest, giant field enhancement within\nsubwavelength particles at light scattering of a plane electromagnetic wave is\nimportant for numerous applications ranging from telecommunications to medicine\nand biology. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the enhancement of\nthe intensity of the magnetic field in a high-index dielectric cylinder at the\nproximity of the dipolar Mie resonances by more than two orders of magnitude\nfor both the TE and TM polarizations of the incident wave. We present a\ncomplete theoretical explanation of the effect and show that the phenomenon is\nvery general - it should be observed for any high-index particles. The results\nexplain the huge enhancement of nonlinear effects observed recently in optics,\nsuggesting a new landscape for all-dielectric nonlinear nanoscale photonics.\n", "  RXJ 1301.9+2747 is an optically identified very low mass AGN candidate with\nM_BH~1x10^6M_sun, which shows extremely soft X-ray emission and unusual X-ray\nvariability in the form of short-lived flares. We present an analysis of\nmultiwavelength observations of RXJ 1301.9+2747 in order to study the\nproperties of the active nucleus and its host galaxy. The UV-to-X-ray spectrum\nin the quiescent state can be well and self-consistently described by a thermal\nand a Comptonized emission from accretion disk, with blackbody dominating ~70%\nof the X-rays in the 0.2-2 keV. The same model can describe the X-ray spectrum\nin the flare state but the Comptonized component becomes dominant (~80%). The\nbest-fit implies an Eddington ratio of ~0.14, and a black hole mass of\n1.7-2.8x10^6M_sun, in agreement with the estimation from the optical data\nwithin errors. However, the best-fitting model under-predicts the optical flux\nfor the HST point source by a factor of ~2. The excess of nuclear optical\nemission could be attributed to a nuclear stellar cluster which is frequently\nseen in low mass AGNs. The X-ray to optical spectral slope (alpha_ox) is lower\nthan in most other active galaxies, which may be attributed to intrinsically\nX-ray weakness due to very little hot and optically thin coronal emission. We\nperformed a pilot search for weak or hidden broad emission lines using optical\nspectropolarimetry observations, but no any polarized broad lines are detected.\nThe host galaxy appears to be a disk galaxy with a boxy pseudobulge or nuclear\nbar accounting for ~15% of the total starlight, which is consistent with the\ngeneral characteristics of the host of low mass AGNs.\n", "  Chiral spin textures at the interface between ferromagnetic and heavy\nnonmagnetic metals, such as Neel-type domain walls and skyrmions, have been\nstudied intensively because of their great potential for future nanomagnetic\ndevices. The Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is an essential phenomenon\nfor the formation of such chiral spin textures. In spite of recent theoretical\nprogress aiming at understanding the microscopic origin of the DMI, an\nexperimental investigation unravelling the physics at stake is still required.\nHere, we experimentally demonstrate the close correlation of the DMI with the\nanisotropy of the orbital magnetic moment and with the magnetic dipole moment\nof the ferromagnetic metal. The density functional theory and the tight-binding\nmodel calculations reveal that asymmetric electron occupation in orbitals gives\nrise to this correlation.\n", "  We describe a CDT-like model where breaking of W3 symmetry will lead to the\nemergence of time and subsequently of space. Surprisingly the simplest such\nmodels which lead to higher dimensional spacetimes are based on the four\n\"magical\" Jordan algebras of 3x3 Hermitian matrices with real, complex,\nquaternion and octonion entries, respectively. The simplest symmetry breaking\nleads to universes with spacetime dimensions 3, 4, 6, and 10.\n", "  We explore a regime of laser-driven plasma acceleration of electrons where\nthe radial envelope of the laser-pulse incident at the plasma entrance is\nstrongly mismatched to the nonlinear plasma electron response excited by it.\nThis regime has been experimentally studied with the gemini laser using f/40\nfocusing optics in August 2015 and f/20 in 2008. The physical mechanisms and\nthe scaling laws of electron acceleration achievable in a laser-plasma\naccelerator have been studied in the radially matched laser regime and thus are\nnot accurate in the strongly mismatched regime explored here. In this work, we\nshow that a novel adjusted-a0 model applicable over a specific range of\ndensities where the laser enters the state of a strong optical shock, describes\nthe mismatched regime. Beside several novel aspects of laser-plasma interaction\ndynamics relating to an elongating bubble shape and the corresponding\nself-injection mechanism, importantly we find that in this strongly mismatched\nregime when the laser pulse transforms into an optical shock it is possible to\nachieve beam-energies that significantly exceed the incident intensity matched\nregime scaling laws.\n", "  The existence of exact solutions which represent a lattice of black holes at\na scalar-field-dominated cosmological bounce suggests that black holes could\npersist through successive eras of a cyclic cosmology. Here we explore some\nremarkable cosmological consequences of this proposal. In different mass ranges\npre-big-bang black holes could explain the dark matter, provide seeds for\ngalaxies, generate entropy and even drive the bounce itself. The cycles end\nnaturally when the filling factor of the black holes reaches unity and this\ncould entail a dimensional transition.\n", "  This talk explores the role of flavor physics to constrain beyond standard\nmodel phenomena and future prospects, from a theoretical point of view.\nPossible implications of some experimental results in tension with the standard\nmodel are discussed, such as the 4 sigma deviation in the B -> D(*) tau nu\ndecay rates. We use the examples of constraining new physics contributions to\nneutral meson mixing and the search for possible vector-like fermions to\nillustrate the expected progress over the next decade to increase the\nsensitivity to new physics at shorter distance scales. We also speculate about\nthe ultimate limitations of (quark) flavor physics probes of new physics.\n", "  Let $\\textsf{A},\\textsf{A}^*$ be the fundamental generators of the\n$q-$Onsager algebra. A linear basis for the $q-$Onsager algebra is known as the\n`zig-zag' basis [IT09]. In this letter, an attractive basis for the $q-$Onsager\nalgebra is conjectured, based on the relation between the $q-$Onsager algebra\nand a quotient of the infinite dimensional algebra ${\\cal A}_q$ introduced in\n[BK05].\n", "  Following \\cite{ipel1}, we consider a nonlinear SIS-type nonlocal system\ndescribing the spread of epidemics on networks, assuming nonlimited\ntransmission, We prove local existence of a unique solution for any diffusion\ncoefficients and global existence in the case of equal diffusion coefficients.\nNext we study the asymptotic behaviour of the solution and show that the\ndisease-free equilibrium (DFE) is linearly and globally asymptotically stable\nwhen the total mean population is small. Finally, we prove that the solution of\nthe system converge to the $DFE$.\n", "  Within one billion years of the Big Bang, intergalactic hydrogen was ionized\nby sources emitting ultraviolet and higher energy photons. This was the final\nphenomenon to globally affect all the baryons (visible matter) in the Universe.\nIt is referred to as cosmic reionization and is an integral component of\ncosmology. It is broadly expected that intrinsically faint galaxies were the\nprimary ionizing sources due to their abundance in this epoch. However, at the\nhighest redshifts ($z>7.5$; lookback time 13.1 Gyr), all galaxies with\nspectroscopic confirmations to date are intrinsically bright and, therefore,\nnot necessarily representative of the general population. Here, we report the\nunequivocal spectroscopic detection of a low luminosity galaxy at $z>7.5$. We\ndetected the Lyman-$\\alpha$ emission line at $\\sim 10504$ {\\AA} in two separate\nobservations with MOSFIRE on the Keck I Telescope and independently with the\nHubble Space Telescope's slit-less grism spectrograph, implying a source\nredshift of $z = 7.640 \\pm 0.001$. The galaxy is gravitationally magnified by\nthe massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ($z = 0.545$), with an estimated\nintrinsic luminosity of $M_{AB} = -19.6 \\pm 0.2$ mag and a stellar mass of\n$M_{\\star} = 3.0^{+1.5}_{-0.8} \\times 10^8$ solar masses. Both are an order of\nmagnitude lower than the four other Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters currently known at\n$z > 7.5$, making it probably the most distant representative source of\nreionization found to date.\n"]}
