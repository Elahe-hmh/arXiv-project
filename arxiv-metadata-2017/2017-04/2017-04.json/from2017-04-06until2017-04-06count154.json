The associated field\nequations then resemble unimodular gravity whose otherwise arbitrary\ncosmological constant is now determined as a Machian universal average. We\nprove that an empty space-time is necessarily Ricci tensor flat, and\ndemonstrate the vanishing of the cosmological constant within the scalar field\nparadigm. The cosmological analysis, carried out at the mini-superspace level,\nreveals a vanishing cosmological constant for a Universe which cannot be closed\nas long as gravity is attractive. Finally, we give an example of a normalized\ntheory of gravity which does give rise to a non-zero cosmological constant.\n", "  We study particle number fluctuations in the quantum ground states of a\nmixture of two spin-1 atomic condensates when the interspecies spin-exchange\ncoupling interaction $c_{12}\\beta$ is adjusted. The two spin-1 condensates\nforming the mixture are respectively ferromagnetic and polar in the absence of\nan external magnetic (B-) field. We categorize all possible ground states using\nthe angular momentum algebra and compute their characteristic atom number\nfluctuations, focusing especially on the the AA phase (when $ c_{12}\\beta >0$),\nwhere the ground state becomes fragmented and atomic number fluctuations\nexhibit drastically different features from a single stand alone spin-1 polar\ncondensate. Our results are further supported by numerical simulations of the\nfull quantum many-body system.\n", "  We explore the photonic (bright) side of dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB) by\nmeasuring the radiation emitted by a dc voltage-biased Josephson junction\nembedded in a microwave resonator. In this regime Cooper pair tunneling is\ninelastic and associated to the transfer of an energy 2eV into the resonator\nmodes. We have measured simultaneously the Cooper pair current and the photon\nemission rate at the resonance frequency of the resonator. Our results show two\nregimes, in which each tunneling Cooper pair emits either one or two photons\ninto the resonator. The spectral properties of the emitted radiation are\naccounted for by an extension to DCB theory.\n", "  We study the spin mixing dynamics of ultracold spin-1 atoms in a weak\nnon-uniform magnetic field with field gradient $G$, which can flip the spin\nfrom +1 to -1 so that the magnetization $m=\\rho_{+}-\\rho_{-}$ is not any more a\nconstant. The dynamics of $m_F=0$ Zeeman component $\\rho_{0}$, as well as the\nsystem magnetization $m$, are illustrated for both ferromagnetic and polar\ninteraction cases in the mean-field theory. We find that the dynamics of system\nmagnetization can be tuned between the Josephson-like oscillation similar to\nthe case of double well, and the interesting self-trapping regimes, i.e. the\nspin mixing dynamics sustains a spontaneous magnetization. Meanwhile the\ndynamics of $\\rho_0$ may be sufficiently suppressed for initially imbalanced\nnumber distribution in the case of polar interaction. A \"beat-frequency\"\noscillation of the magnetization emerges in the case of balanced initial\ndistribution for polar interaction, which vanishes for ferromagnetic\ninteraction.\n", "  We study random two-component spanning forests ($2$SFs) of finite graphs,\ngiving formulas for the first and second moments of the sizes of the\ncomponents, vertex-inclusion probabilities for one or two vertices, and the\nprobability that an edge separates the components. We compute the limit of\nthese quantities when the graph tends to an infinite periodic graph in\n${\\mathbb R}^d$.\n", "  We present a density-functional theory for the one dimensional harmonically\ntrapped Bose-Fermi mixture with repulsive contact interactions. The ground\nstate density distribution of each component is obtained by solving the\nKohn-Sham equations numerically based on the Local Density Approximation and\nthe exact solution for the homogeneous system given by Bethe ansatz method. It\nis shown that for strong enough interaction, a considerable amount of fermions\nare repelled out of the central region of the trap, exhibiting partial phase\nseparation of Bose and Fermi components. Oscillations emerge in the Bose\ndensity curves reflecting the strong correlation with Fermions. For infinite\nstrong interaction, the ground state energy of the mixture and the total\ndensity are consistent with the scenario that all atoms in the mixture are\nfully fermionized.\n", "  The first measurements of the invariant differential cross sections of\ninclusive $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ meson production at mid-rapidity in proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV are reported. The $\\pi^0$\nmeasurement covers the ranges $0.4<p_T<7$ GeV/$c$ and $0.3<p_T<25$ GeV/$c$ for\nthese two energies, respectively. The production of $\\eta$ mesons was measured\nat $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV in the range $0.4<p_T<15$ GeV/$c$. Next-to-Leading Order\nperturbative QCD calculations, which are consistent with the $\\pi^0$ spectrum\nat $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$ TeV, overestimate those of $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ mesons at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, but agree with the measured $\\eta/\\pi^0$ ratio at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV.\n", "  Identical neutral kaon pair correlations are measured in $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV pp\ncollisions in the ALICE experiment. One-dimensional K$^0_s$K$^0_s$ correlation\nfunctions in terms of the invariant momentum difference of kaon pairs are\nformed in two multiplicity and two transverse momentum ranges. The femtoscopic\nparameters for the radius and correlation strength of the kaon source are\nextracted. The f${\\rm i}$t includes quantum statistics and final-state\ninteractions of the a$_0$/f$_0$ resonance. K$^0_s$K$^0_s$ correlations show an\nincrease in radius for increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease in radius\nfor increasing transverse mass, $m_{\\rm T}$, as seen in $\\pi\\pi$ correlations\nin the pp system and in heavy-ion collisions. Transverse mass scaling is\nobserved between the K$^0_s$K$^0_s$ and $\\pi\\pi$ radii. Also, the f${\\rm i}$rst\nobservation is made of the decay of the f$_2'$(1525) meson into the\nK$^0_s$K$^0_s$ channel in pp collisions.\n", "  We define natural probability measures on cycle-rooted spanning forests\n(CRSFs) on graphs embedded on a surface with a Riemannian metric. These\nmeasures arise from the Laplacian determinant and depend on the choice of a\nunitary connection on the tangent bundle to the surface.\n  We show that, for a sequence of graphs $(G_n)$ conformally approximating the\nsurface, the measures on CRSFs of $G_n$ converge and give a limiting\nprobability measure on finite multicurves (finite collections of pairwise\ndisjoint simple closed curves) on the surface, independent of the approximating\nsequence.\n  Wilson's algorithm for generating spanning trees on a graph generalizes to a\ncycle-popping algorithm for generating CRSFs for a general family of weights on\nthe cycles. We use this to sample the above measures. The sampling algorithm,\nwhich relates these measures to the loop-erased random walk, is also used to\nprove tightness of the sequence of measures, a key step in the proof of their\nconvergence.\n  We set the framework for the study of these probability measures and their\nscaling limits and state some of their properties.\n", "  A more reasonable trial ground state wave function is constructed for the\nrelative motion of an interacting two-fermion system in a 1D harmonic\npotential. At the boundaries both the wave function and its first derivative\nare continuous and the quasi-momentum is determined by a more practical\nconstraint condition which associates two variational parameters. The upper\nbound of the ground state energy is obtained by applying the variational\nprinciple to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of relative motion on the\ntrial wave function. The resulted energy and wave function show better\nagreement with the analytical solution than the original proposal.\n", "  We propose the density-functional theory for one-dimensional harmonically\ntrapped spin-1 bosons in the ground state with repulsive density-density\ninteraction and anti-ferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. The density\ndistributions of spin singlet paired bosons and polarized bosons with different\ntotal polarization for various interaction parameters are obtained by solving\nthe Kohn-Sham equations which are derived based on the local density\napproximation and the Bethe ansatz exact results for homogeneous system.\nNon-monotonicity of the central densities is attributed to the competition\nbetween the density interaction and spin-exchange. The results reveal the phase\nseparation of the paired and polarized bosons, the density profiles of which\nrespectively approach the Tonks-Girardeau gases of Bose-Bose pairs and scalar\nbosons in the case of strong interaction. We give the R-P phase diagram at\nstrong interaction and find the critical polarization, which paves the way to\ndirect observe the exotic singlet pairing in spinor gas experimentally.\n", "  We construct triples of commuting real structures on the moduli space of\nHiggs bundles, whose fixed loci are branes of type (B, A, A), (A, B, A) and (A,\nA, B). We study the real points through the associated spectral data and\ndescribe the topological invariants involved using KO, KR and equivariant\nK-theory.\n", "  When a simply connected domain $D\\subset{\\mathbb{R}}^d$ ($d\\ge 2$) is\napproximated in a \"good\" way by embedded connected weighted graphs, we prove\nthat the transfer current matrix (defined on the edges of the graph viewed as\nan electrical network) converges, up to a local weight factor, to the\ndifferential of Green's function on $D$.\n  This observation implies that properly rescaled correlations of the spanning\ntree model and correlations of minimal subconfigurations in the abelian\nsandpile model have a universal and conformally covariant limit.\n  We further show that, on a periodic approximation of the domain, all pattern\nfields of the spanning tree model, as well as the minimal-pattern (e.g.\nzero-height) fields of the sandpile, converge weakly in distribution to\nGaussian white noise.\n", "  The Ultimatum Game (UG) is an economic game where two players (proposer and\nresponder) decide how to split a certain amount of money. While traditional\neconomic theories based on rational decision making predict that the proposer\nshould make a minimal offer and the responder should accept it, human subjects\ntend to behave more fairly in UG. Previous studies suggested that extra\ninformation such as reputation, empathy, or spatial structure is needed for\nfairness to evolve in UG. Here we show that fairness can evolve without\nadditional information if players make decisions probabilistically and may\ncontinue interactions when the offer is rejected, which we call the Not Quite\nUltimatum Game (NQUG). Evolutionary simulations of NQUG showed that the\nprobabilistic decision making contributes to the increase of proposers' offer\namounts to avoid rejection, while the repetition of the game works to\nresponders' advantage because they can wait until a good offer comes. These\nsimple extensions greatly promote evolution of fairness in both proposers'\noffers and responders' acceptance thresholds.\n", "  Photo-generated charge in thick, back-illuminated, fully-depleted CCDs is\ntransported by electric fields from the silicon substrate to the collecting\nwell at the front gate of the CCDs. However, electric fields transverse to the\nsurface of the CCD -with diverse origins such as doping gradients, guard rings\naround the imaging area of the sensor, and physical stresses on the silicon\nlattice- displace this charge, effectively modifying the pixel area and\nproducing noticeable signals in astrometric and photometric measurements. We\nuse data from the science verification period of the Dark Energy Survey (DES)\nto characterize these effects in the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) CCDs. The\ntransverse fields mainly manifest as concentric rings (\"tree rings\") and bright\nstripes near the boundaries of the detectors (\"edge distortions\") with relative\namplitudes of about 1% and 10% in the flat-field images, respectively. Their\nnature as pixel size variations is confirmed by comparing their photometric and\nastrometric signatures. Using flat-field images from DECam, we derive templates\nin the five DES photometric bands (grizY) for the tree rings and the edge\ndistortions as a function of their position in each DECam detector. These\ntemplates can be directly incorporated into the derivation of photometric and\nastrometric solutions, helping to meet the DES photometric and astrometric\nrequirements.\n", "  After recalling the differential geometry of non-metric connections in the\nformalism of differential forms, we introduce the idea of a Non-Metricity (NM)\nconnection, whose connection $1$--forms coincides with the non-metricity\n$1$--forms for a class of cobase fields. Then we formulate a theory of\ngravitation (equivalent to General Relativity (GR)) which admits a geometrical\ninterpretation in a flat torsionless space where the gravitational field is\ncompletely manifest in the non-metricity of a NM connection. We define and then\napply the non-metricity gauge to a gravitational Lagrangian density discovered\nby Wallner and which is equivalent to the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian density.\nThe Einstein equations coupled to the matter currents $\\left(\n\\mathcal{J}_{\\alpha}\\right) $ thus becomes $\\delta\ndg_{\\alpha}=\\mathcal{T}_{\\alpha}+\\mathcal{J}_{\\alpha}$, where $\\left(\n\\mathcal{T}_{\\alpha}\\right) $ is identified as the gravitational\nenergy-momentum currents, to which we shall find a relatively simple and\nphysically appealing form. It is also shown that in the gravitational analogue\nof the Lorenz gauge, our field equations can be written as a system of Proca\nequations, which may be of interest in the study of propagation of\ngravitational-electromagnetic waves.\n", "  The concept of smooth deformation of Riemannian manifolds associated with the\nextrinsic curvature is explained and applied to the FLRW cosmology. We show\nthat such deformation can be derived from Einstein-Hilbert-like dynamical\nprinciple producing an observable effect in the sense of Noether. As a result,\nwe notice on how the extrinsic curvature compensates both quantitative and\nqualitative difference between the cosmological constant $ \\Lambda$ and the\nvacuum energy $\\rho_{vac}$ obtaining the observed upper bound for the\ncosmological constant problem at electroweak scale. The topological\ncharacteristics of the extrinsic curvature are discussed showing that the\nproduced extrinsic scalar curvature is an evolving dynamical quantity.\n", "  We investigate continuous-time quantum walks of two indistinguishable anyons\nin one-dimensional lattices with both on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions\nbased on the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. It is shown that the\ntwo-body correlations in position space are symmetric about the initial sites\nof two quantum walkers in the Bose limit ($\\chi=0$ ) and Fermi limit (\n$\\chi=1$), while in momentum space this happens only in the Bose limit. An\ninteresting asymmetry arises in the correlation for most cases with the\nstatistical parameter $\\chi$ varying in between. It turns out that the origin\nof this asymmetry comes from the fractional statistics that anyons obey. On the\nother hand, the two-body correlations of hard-core anyons in position spaceshow\nuniform behaviors from anti-bunching to co-walking regardless of the\nstatistical parameter. The momentum correlations in the case of strong\ninteraction undergo a smooth process of two stripes smoothly merging into a\nsingle one, i.e. the evolution of fermions into hard-core bosons.\n", "  Quantum conductance fluctuations are investigated in disordered 3D\ntopological insulator quantum wires. Both experiments and theory reveal a new\ntransport regime in a mesoscopic conductor, pseudo-ballistic transport, for\nwhich ballistic properties persist beyond the transport mean free path,\ncharacteristic of diffusive transport. It results in non-universal conductance\nfluctuations due to quasi-1D surface modes, as observed in long and narrow\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ nanoribbons. Spin helical Dirac fermions in quantum wires retain\npseudo-ballistic properties over an unusually broad energy range, due to strong\nquantum confinement and weak momentum scattering.\n", "  Cooperation is ubiquitous in biological and social systems. Previous studies\nrevealed that a preference toward similar appearance promotes cooperation, a\nphenomenon called tag-mediated cooperation or communitarian cooperation. This\neffect is enhanced when a spatial structure is incorporated, because space\nallows agents sharing an identical tag to regroup to form locally cooperative\nclusters. In spatially distributed settings, one can also consider migration of\norganisms, which has a potential to further promote evolution of cooperation by\nfacilitating spatial clustering. However, it has not yet been considered in\nspatial tag-mediated cooperation models. Here we show, using computer\nsimulations of a spatial model of evolutionary games with organismal migration,\nthat tag-based segregation and homophilic cooperation arise for a wide range of\nparameters. In the meantime, our results also show another evolutionarily\nstable outcome, where a high level of heterophilic cooperation is maintained in\nspatially well-mixed patterns. We found that these two different forms of\ntag-mediated cooperation appear alternately as the parameter for temptation to\ndefect is increased.\n", "  The merger of two like-signed vortices is a well-studied problem, but in a\nturbulent flow, we may often have more than two like-signed vortices\ninteracting. We study the merger of three or more identical co-rotating\nvortices initially arranged on the vertices of a regular polygon. At low to\nmoderate Reynolds numbers, we find an additional stage in the merger process,\nabsent in the merger of two vortices, where an annular vortical structure is\nformed and is long-lived. Vortex merger is slowed down significantly due to\nthis. Such annular vortices are known at far higher Reynolds numbers in studies\nof tropical cyclones, which have been noticed to a break down into individual\nvortices. In the pre-annular stage, vortical structures in a viscous flow are\nfound here to tilt and realign in a manner similar to the inviscid case, but\nthe pronounced filaments visible in the latter are practically absent in the\nformer. Interestingly at higher Reynolds numbers, the merger of an odd number\nof vortices is found to proceed very differently from that of an even number.\nThe former process is rapid and chaotic whereas the latter proceeds more slowly\nvia pairing events. The annular vortex takes the form of a generalised\nLamb-Oseen vortex (GLO), and diffuses inwards until it forms a standard\nLamb-Oseen vortex. For lower Reynolds number, the numerical (fully nonlinear)\nevolution of the GLO vortex follows exactly the analytical evolution until\nmerger. At higher Reynolds numbers, the annulus goes through instabilities\nwhose nonlinear stages show a pronounced difference between even and odd mode\ndisturbances. It is hoped that the present findings, that multiple vortex\nmerger is qualitatively different from the merger of two vortices, will\nmotivate studies on how multiple vortex interactions affect the inverse cascade\nin two-dimensional turbulence.\n", "  We study two-dimensional (2D) binary-fluid turbulence by carrying out an\nextensive direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the forced, statistically steady\nturbulence in the coupled Cahn-Hilliard and Navier-Stokes equations. In the\nabsence of any coupling, we choose parameters that lead (a) to spinodal\ndecomposition and domain growth, which is characterized by the spatiotemporal\nevolution of the Cahn-Hilliard order parameter $\\phi$, and (b) the formation of\nan inverse-energy-cascade regime in the energy spectrum $E(k)$, in which energy\ncascades towards wave numbers $k$ that are smaller than the energy-injection\nscale $k_{inj}$ in the turbulent fluid. We show that the\nCahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes coupling leads to an arrest of phase separation at\na length scale $L_c$, which we evaluate from $S(k)$, the spectrum of the\nfluctuations of $\\phi$. We demonstrate that (a) $L_c \\sim L_H$, the Hinze scale\nthat follows from balancing inertial and interfacial-tension forces, and (b)\n$L_c$ is independent, within error bars, of the diffusivity $D$. We elucidate\nhow this coupling modifies $E(k)$ by blocking the inverse energy cascade at a\nwavenumber $k_c$, which we show is $\\simeq 2\\pi/L_c$. We compare our work with\nearlier studies of this problem.\n", "  We study the deformation caused by the influence of extrinsic curvature on a\nvacuum spherically symmetric metric embedded in a five-dimensional bulk. In\nthis sense, we investigate the produced black-holes and derive general\ncharacteristics such as their masses, horizons, singularities and thermal\nproperties. As a test, we also study the bending of light near such black-holes\nanalyzing the movement of a test particle and the modification caused by\nextrinsic curvature on its movement. Accordingly, using the asymptotically\nconformal flat condition for the extrinsic curvature, an analytical expansion\nof a set of \\emph{n}-scalar fields can be defined and we show that the\ncorresponding black holes must be large and constrained in the range of allowed\nvalues $-1/2 \\leq n \\leq 1.8$. As a result, they are locally thermodynamically\nstable, but not globally preferred.\n", "  We show that the quantum query complexity of evaluating NAND-tree instances\nwith average choice complexity at most $W$ is $O(W)$, where average choice\ncomplexity is a measure of the difficulty of winning the associated two-player\ngame. This generalizes a superpolynomial speedup over classical query\ncomplexity due to Zhan et al. [Zhan et al., ITCS 2012, 249-265]. We further\nshow that the player with a winning strategy for the two-player game associated\nwith the NAND-tree can win the game with an expected\n$\\widetilde{O}(N^{1/4}\\sqrt{{\\cal C}(x)})$ quantum queries against a random\nopponent, where ${\\cal C }(x)$ is the average choice complexity of the\ninstance. This gives an improvement over the query complexity of the naive\nstrategy, which costs $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ queries.\n  The results rely on a connection between NAND-tree evaluation and\n$st$-connectivity problems on certain graphs, and span programs for\n$st$-connectivity problems. Our results follow from relating average choice\ncomplexity to the effective resistance of these graphs, which itself\ncorresponds to the span program witness size.\n", "  Given any covariance matrix corresponding to a so-called pure Gaussian state,\na linear quantum system can be designed to achieve the assigned covariance\nmatrix. In most cases, however, one might obtain a system that is difficult to\nrealize in practice. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a special\nclass of linear quantum systems, i.e., systems with diagonal passive\nHamiltonian and a single dissipative channel. The practical implementation of\nsuch a system would be relatively simple. We then parametrize the class of pure\nGaussian state covariance matrices that can be achieved by this particular type\nof linear quantum system.\n", "  Although, for current laser pulse energies, the weakly nonlinear regime of\nLWFA is known to be the optimal for reaching the highest possible electron\nenergies, the capabilities of upcoming large laser systems will provide the\npossibility of running highly nonlinear regimes of laser pulse propagation in\nunderdense or near-critical plasmas. Using an extended particle-in-cell (PIC)\nmodel that takes into account all the relevant physics, we show that such\nregimes can be implemented with external guiding for a relatively long distance\nof propagation and allow for the stable transformation of laser energy into\nother types of energy, including the kinetic energy of a large number of high\nenergy electrons and their incoherent emission of photons. This is despite the\nfact that the high intensity of the laser pulse triggers a number of new\nmechanisms of energy depletion, which we investigate systematically.\n", "  In this work, we apply the smooth deformation concept in order to obtain a\nmodification of Friedmann equations. It is shown that the cosmic coincidence\ncan be at least alleviated using the dynamical properties of the extrinsic\ncurvature. We investigate the transition from nucleosynthesis to the\ncoincidence era obtaining a very small variation of the ratio\n$r=\\frac{\\rho_{m}}{\\rho_{ext}}$, that compares the matter energy density to\nextrinsic energy density, compatible with the known behavior of the\ndeceleration parameter. We also show that the calculated \"equivalence\" redshift\nmatches the transition redshift from a deceleration to accelerated phase and\nthe coincidence ceases to be. The dynamics on $r$ is also studied based on\nHubble parameter observations as the latest Baryons Acoustic\nOscillations/Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (BAO/CMBR) + SNIa.\n", "  We present a variational study of the spin-1 Bose gases in a harmonic trap\nwith three-dimensional spin-orbit coupling of Weyl type. For weak spin-orbit\ncoupling, we treat the single-particle ground states as the form of\nperturbational harmonic oscillator states in the lowest total angular momentum\nmanifold with $j=1, m_j=1,0,-1$. When the two-body interaction is considered,\nwe set the trail order parameter as the superposition of three degenerate\nsingle-particle ground-states and the weight coefficients are determined by\nminimizing the energy functional. Two ground state phases, namely the magnetic\nand the nematic phases, are identified depending on the spin-independent and\nthe spin-dependent interactions. Unlike the non-spin-orbit-coupled spin-1\nBose-Einstein condensate for which the phase boundary between the magnetic and\nthe nematic phase lies exactly at zero spin-dependent interaction, the boundary\nis modified by the spin-orbit-coupling. We find the magnetic phase is featured\nwith phase-separated density distributions, 3D skyrmion-like spin textures and\ncompeting magnetic and biaxial nematic orders, while the nematic phase is\nfeatured with miscible density distributions, zero magnetization and spatially\nmodulated uniaxial nematic order. The emergence of higher spin order creates\nnew opportunities for exploring spin-tensor-related physics in spin-orbit\ncoupled superfluid.\n", "  We have measured the K-shell and total internal conversion coefficients,\nalpha_K and alpha_T, for the 150.8-keV E3 transition in 111Cd to be 1.449(18)\nand 2.217(26) respectively. The alpha_K result agrees well with Dirac-Fock\ncalculations in which the effect of the K-shell atomic vacancy is accounted\nfor; it extends our precision tests of alpha_K calculations to Z = 48, the\nlowest Z yet measured. However, the result for alpha_T disagrees by about two\nstandard deviations from the calculated alpha_T value, whether or not the\natomic vacancy is included.\n", "  Critical fluctuations are known to change the effective anisotropy of cubic\nferromagnet near the Curie point. If the crystal undergoes phase transition\ninto orthorhombic phase and the initial anisotropy is not too strong, effective\nanisotropy acquires at T_c the universal value A* = v*/u* where u* and v* are\ncoordinates of the cubic fixed point entering the scaling equation of state and\nexpressions for nonlinear susceptibilities. In the paper, the numerical value\nof the anisotropy parameter A at the critical point is estimated using the\n\\epsilon-expansion and pseudo-\\epsilon-expansion techniques. Pade resummation\nof six-loop pseudo-$\\epsilon$-expansions for u*, v*, and A* leads to the\nestimate A* = 0.13 close to that extracted from the five-loop\n\\epsilon-expansion but differing considerably from the value A* = 0.089 given\nby the analysis of six-loop expansions of the \\beta-functions themselves. This\ndiscrepancy is discussed and its roots are cleared up.\n", "  Renormalized coupling constants g_{2k} that enter the critical equation of\nstate and determine nonlinear susceptibilities of the system possess universal\nvalues g*_{2k} at the Curie point. They are calculated, along with the ratios\nR_{2k} = g_{2k}/g_4^{k-1}, for the three-dimensional scalar \\lambda\\phi^4 field\ntheory within the pseudo-\\epsilon-expansion approach.\nPseudo-\\epsilon-expansions for g*_6, g*_8, R*_6, and R*_8 are derived in the\nfive-loop approximation, numerical estimates are presented for R*_6 and R*_8.\nThe higher-order coefficients of the pseudo-\\epsilon-expansions for the sextic\ncoupling are so small that simple Pade approximants turn out to be sufficient\nto yield very good numerical results. Their use gives R*_6 = 1.650 while the\nmost recent lattice estimate is R*_6 = 1.649(2). For the octic coupling\npseudo-\\epsilon-expansions are less favorable from the numerical point of view.\nNevertheless, Pade-Borel resummation leads in this case to R*_8 = 0.890, the\nnumber differing only slightly from the values R*_8 = 0.871, R*_8 = 0.857\nextracted from the lattice and field-theoretical calculations.\n", "  Competing ferroelectric and charge density wave phases have been proposed to\nbe present in the electron-phonon coupled LaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$\nsuperconductor. The lattice instability arises from unstable phonon modes that\ncan break the crystal symmetry. Upon examination of the crystal structure using\nsingle crystal diffraction, we find a superlattice pattern arising from\ncoherent in-plane displacements of the sulfur atoms in the BiS$_{2}$\nsuperconducting planes. The distortions morph into coordinated ferro-distortive\npatterns, challenging previous symmetry suggestions including the possible\npresence of unstable antiferro-distortive patterns. The ferro-distortive\npattern remains in the superconducting state, but with the displacements\ndiminished in magnitude. Moreover, the sulfur displacements can exist in\nseveral polytypes stacked along the c-axis. Charge carriers can get trapped in\nthe lattice deformations reducing the effective number of carriers available\nfor pairing.\n", "  We review the method of uniqueness which is a powerful technique for\nmulti-loop calculations in higher dimensional theories with conformal symmetry.\nWe use the method in momentum space and show that it allows a very transparent\nevaluation of a two-loop massless propagator Feynman diagram with a non-integer\nindex on the central line. The result is applied to the computation of the\noptical conductivity of graphene at the infra-red Lorentz invariant fixed\npoint. The effect of counter-terms is analysed. A brief comparison with the\nnon-relativistic case is included.\n", "  We studied quantum phase transitions in the antiferromagnetic dimerized\nspin-1/2 XY chain andvtwo-leg ladders. From analysis of several spin models we\npresent our main result: the framework to deal with topological orders and\nhidden symmetries within the Landau paradigm. After mapping of the spin\nHamiltonians onto the tight-binding models with Dirac or Majorana fermions and,\nwhen necessary, the mean-field approximation, the analysis can be done\nanalytically. By utilizing duality transformations the calculation of nonlocal\nstring order parameters is mapped onto the local order problem in some dual\nrepresentation and done without further approximations. Calculated phase\ndiagrams, phase boundaries, order parameters and their symmetries for each of\nthe phases provide a comprehensive quantitative Landau description of the\nquantum critical properties of the models considered. Complementarily, the\nphases with hidden orders can also be distinguished by the Pontryagin (winding)\nnumbers which we have calculated as well. This unified framework can be\nstraightforwardly applied for various spin chains and ladders, topological\ninsulators and superconductors. Applications to other systems are under way.\n", "  Niobium nitride (NbN) is widely used in high-frequency superconducting\nelectronics circuits because it has one of the highest superconducting\ntransition temperatures ($T_c$ $\\sim$ 16.5 K) and largest gap among\nconventional superconductors. In its thin-film form, the $T_c$ of NbN is very\nsensitive to growth conditions and it still remains a challenge to grow NbN\nthin film (below 50 nm) with high $T_c$. Here, we report on the superconducting\nproperties of NbN thin films grown by high-temperature chemical vapor\ndeposition (HTCVD). Transport measurements reveal significantly lower disorder\nthan previously reported, characterized by a Ioffe-Regel ($k_F$$\\ell$)\nparameter of $\\sim$ 14. Accordingly we observe $T_c$ $\\sim$ 17.06 K (point of\n50% of normal state resistance), the highest value reported so far for films of\nthickness below 50 nm, indicating that HTCVD could be particularly useful for\ngrowing high quality NbN thin films.\n", "  It is shown that in the spin-charge-family theory, as well as in all the\nKaluza-Klein like theories, vielbeins and spin connections manifest in\n$d=(3+1)$ space equivalent vector gauge fields, when space with $d\\ge5$\nmanifests large enough symmetry. The authors demonstrate this equivalence in\nspaces with the symmetry of the metric tensor in the space out of $d=(3+1)$ -\n$g^{\\sigma \\tau} = \\eta^{\\sigma \\tau} \\,f^{2}$ - for any scalar function $f$ of\nthe coordinates $x^{\\sigma}$, where $x^{\\sigma}$ denotes coordinates of space\nout of $d=(3+1)$. Also the connection between vielbeins and scalar gauge fields\nin $d=(3+1)$ (offering the explanation for the Higgs's scalar) is discussed.\n", "  We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with crystalline\npoint group symmetry, dubbed point group SPT (pgSPT) phases. We show that such\nphases can be understood in terms of lower-dimensional topological phases with\non-site symmetry, and can be constructed as stacks and arrays of these\nlower-dimensional states. This provides the basis for a general framework to\nclassify and characterize bosonic and fermionic pgSPT phases, that can be\napplied for arbitrary crystalline point group symmetry and in arbitrary spatial\ndimension. We develop and illustrate this framework by means of a few examples,\nfocusing on three-dimensional states. We classify bosonic pgSPT phases and\nfermionic topological crystalline superconductors with $Z_2^P$ (reflection)\nsymmetry, electronic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with ${\\rm U}(1)\n\\times {Z}_2^P$ symmetry, and bosonic pgSPT phases with $C_{2v}$ symmetry,\nwhich is generated by two perpendicular mirror reflections. We also study\nsurface properties, with a focus on gapped, topologically ordered surface\nstates. For electronic TCIs we find a $Z_8 \\times Z_2$ classification, where\nthe $Z_8$ corresponds to known states obtained from non-interacting electrons,\nand the $Z_2$ corresponds to a \"strongly correlated\" TCI that requires strong\ninteractions in the bulk. Our approach may also point the way toward a general\ntheory of symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases with crystalline point\ngroup symmetry.\n", "  The early stages of a galaxy's evolution leave an imprint on its metallicity\ndistribution. We discuss the origins and evolution of radial metallicity\ngradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical chemical evolution\nmodel. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are\ndetermined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming\nISM, radial changes in the star-formation history (in particular inside-out\nformation), and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,\ninside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but\ncontributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the\nmetallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative\nd[Fe/H]/dR in some high redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in\nlocal observations.\n  We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive\nd[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal\nvelocity and the metallicity (positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the\nMilky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high central gas-loss\nrates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion of enriched material in\nconjunction with inside-out formation, and near-disc galactic fountaining. For\nthe Milky Way thick disc, we show that the positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]\ncorrelation points to comparable timescales for inside-out formation, initial\nmetal enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM\nmetallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the\nhigh-metallicity tail of the alpha enhanced population. Including inside-out\nformation in our models changes the local vertical metallicity gradient by\nabout -0.2dex/kpc, in line with local measurements.\n", "  We study the parameterized post-Newtonian approximation in teleparallel model\nof gravity with a scalar field. The scalar field is non-minimally coupled to\nthe scalar torsion as well as to the boundary term introduced in [1]. We show\nthat, in contrast to the case where the scalar field is only coupled to the\nscalar torsion, the presence of the new coupling affects the parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameters. These parameters for different situations are\nobtained and discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the anomalous planets precession in the\nnearly-newtonian gravitational regime. This limit is obtained from the\napplication of the slow motion condition to the geodesic equations without\naltering the geodesic deviation equations. Using a non-standard expression for\nthe perihelion advance from the Weyl conformastatic vacuum solution as a model,\nwe can describe the anomaly in planets precession compared with different\nobservational data from Ephemerides of the Planets and the Moon (EPM2008 and\nEPM2011) and Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris (INPOP10a). As a result, using the\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm and calculating the related Chi-squared\nstatistic, we find that the anomaly is statistical irrelevant in accordance\nwith INPOP10a observations. As a complement to this work, we also do an\napplication to the relativistic precession of giant planets using observational\ndata calibrated with the EPM2011.\n", "  Quantum mechanics allows for multiple predictions for the outcome of an EPR\nexperiment. The correct calculation must be used, guided by the physical\nconditions of the experiment. The quantum joint prediction for EPR correlation\nis derived and shown to involve a single sampling. The solution for separated\nmeasurement, where there are two private samplings, is then developed using\northodox quantum mechanics with Luders' rule for state projection on\nmeasurement. The separated solution is shown to duplicate the predictions of\nthe quantum joint solution. However, it is shown that this solution requires\nsuperluminal transmission of information and therefore it is physically\nimpossible. Alternative predictions respecting special relativity are developed\nusing both Von Neumann projection and null projection (no projection at all).\nConditions for the proper application of state projection rules are considered\nand Luders' rule is identified as the primary culprit in the EPR paradox. It\ncannot be applied to EPR.\n", "  The empirical Coffin-Manson law has been used to characterize the low-cycle\nmechanical fatigue failure of metallic materials for decades. Our experimental\nstudies reported in this letter have shown that the electrical fatigue failure\nin dielectrics can be well described by a fitting function having the same\nmathematical expression as that of the Coffin-Manson law. This observation\nindicates that the physical mechanism beneath the formation and evolution of\natomic disordered structures, the key factor influencing both mechanical and\nelectrical fatigue, might be the same.\n", "  We study the spreading of a bacterial colony undergoing turbulent like\ncollective motion. We present two minimalistic models to investigate the\ninterplay between population growth and coherent structures arising from\nturbulence. Using Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the proposed models we\nfind that turbulence has two prominent effects on the spatial growth of the\ncolony: (a) the front speed is enhanced, and (b) the front gets crumpled. Both\nthese effects, which we highlight by using statistical tools, are markedly\ndifferent in our two models. We also show that the crumpled front structure and\nthe passive scalar fronts in random flows are related in certain regimes.\n", "  Understanding the mechanisms that control three-dimensional (3D) fluid\ntransport is central to many processes including mixing, chemical reaction and\nbiological activity. Here a novel mechanism for 3D transport is uncovered where\nfluid particles are kicked between streamlines near a localized shear, which\noccurs in many flows and materials. This results in 3D transport similar to\nResonance Induced Dispersion (RID); however, this new mechanism is more rapid\nand mutually incompatible with RID. We explore its governing impact with both\nan abstract 2-action flow and a model fluid flow. We show that transitions from\none-dimensional (1D) to two-dimensional (2D) and 2D to 3D transport occur based\non the relative magnitudes of streamline jumps in two transverse directions.\n", "  An Exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell field equations for a\nconformastatic metric with magnetized sources is study. In this context,\neffective potential are studied in order to understand the dynamics of the\nmagnetic field in galaxies. We derive the equations of motion for neutral and\ncharged particles in a spacetime background characterized by this class of\nsolutions. In this particular case, we investigate the main physical properties\nof equatorial circular orbits and related effective potentials. In addition, we\nobtain an effective analytic expression for the perihelion advance of test\nparticles. Our theoretical predictions are compared with the observational data\ncalibrated with the ephemerides of the planets of the Solar system and the Moon\n(EPM2011). We show that, in general, the magnetic punctual mass predicts values\nthat are in better agreement with observations than the values predicted in\nEinstein gravity alone.\n", "  We examine the role of thermal fluctuations in two-species Bose-Einstein\ncondensates confined in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) optical lattices using\nthe Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Popov approximation. The method, in\nparticular, is ideal to probe the evolution of quasiparticle modes at finite\ntemperatures. Our studies show that the quasiparticle spectrum in the\nphase-separated domain of the two-species Bose-Einstein condensate has a\ndiscontinuity at some critical value of the temperature. Furthermore, the\nlow-lying modes like the slosh mode becomes degenerate at this critical\ntemperature, and this is associated with the transition from the immiscible\nside-by-side density profile to the miscible phase. Hence, the rotational\nsymmetry of the condensate density profiles are restored, and so is the\ndegeneracy of quasiparticle modes.\n", "  When a Dirac fermion system acquires an energy-gap, it is said to have either\ntrivial (positive energy-gap) or non-trivial (negative energy-gap) topology,\ndepending on the parity ordering of its conduction and valence bands. The\nnon-trivial regime is identified by the presence of topological surface or\nedge-state dispersing in the energy gap of the bulk and is attributed a\nnon-zero topological index. In this work, we show that such topological indices\ncan be determined experimentally via an accurate measurement of the effective\nvelocity of bulk massive Dirac fermions. We demonstrate this analytically\nstarting from the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang Hamiltonian (BHZ) to show how the\ntopological index depends on this velocity. We then experimentally extract the\ntopological index in Pb1-xSnxSe and Pb1-xSnxTe using infrared magnetooptical\nLandau level spectroscopy. This approach is argued to be universal to all\nmaterial classes that can be described by a BHZ-like model and that host a\ntopological phase transition.\n", "  We obtain the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the time that a\nLagrangian tracer or a heavy inertial particle spends in vortical or\nstrain-dominated regions of a turbulent flow, by carrying out direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) of such particles advected by statistically steady,\nhomogeneous and isotropic turbulence in the forced, three-dimensional,\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equation. We use the two invariants, $Q$ and $R$,\nof the velocity-gradient tensor to distinguish between vortical and\nstrain-dominated regions of the flow and partition the $Q-R$ plane into four\ndifferent regions depending on the topology of the flow; out of these four\nregions two correspond to vorticity-dominated regions of the flow and two\ncorrespond to strain-dominated ones. We obtain $Q$ and $R$ along the\ntrajectories of tracers and heavy inertial particles and find out the time\n$\\mathrm{t_{pers}}$ for which they remain in one of the four regions of the\n$Q-R$ plane. We find that the PDFs of $\\mathrm{t_{pers}}$ display exponentially\ndecaying tails for all four regions for tracers and heavy inertial particles.\nFrom these PDFs we extract characteristic times scales, which help us to\nquantify the time that such particles spend in vortical or strain-dominated\nregions of the flow.\n", "  Propagation of high amplitude acoustic pulses is studied in a 1D waveguide\nconnected to a lattice of Helmholtz resonators. An homogenized model has been\nproposed by Sugimoto (J. Fluid. Mech., \\textbf{244} (1992)), taking into\naccount both the nonlinear wave propagation and various mechanisms of\ndissipation. This model is extended here to take into account two important\nfeatures: resonators of different strengths and back-scattering effects. An\nenergy balance is obtained, and a numerical method is developed. A closer\nagreement is reached between numerical and experimental results. Numerical\nexperiments are also proposed to highlight the effect of defects and of\ndisorder.\n", "  We construct the integrals of motion for the 5D deformed Kepler system with\nnon-central potentials in $su(2)$ Yang-Coulomb monopole field. We show that\nthese integrals form a higher rank quadratic algebra $Q(3; L^{so(4)},\nT^{su(2)})\\oplus so(4)$, with structure constants involving the Casimir\noperators of $so(4)$ and $su(2)$ Lie algebras. We realize the quadratic algebra\nin terms of the deformed oscillator and construct its finite-dimensional\nunitary representations. This enable us to derive the energy spectrum of the\nsystem algebraically. Furthermore we show that the model is multiseparable and\nallows separation of variables in the hyperspherical and parabolic coordinates.\nWe also show the separability of its 8D dual system (i.e. the 8D singular\nharmonic oscillator) in the Euler and cylindrical coordinates.\n", "  Owing to technological advances, the number of exoplanets discovered has\nrisen dramatically in the last few years. However, when trying to observe Earth\nanalogs, it is often difficult to test the veracity of detection. We have\ndeveloped a new approach to the analysis of exoplanetary spectral observations\nbased on temporal multifractality, which identifies time scales that\ncharacterize planetary orbital motion around the host star, and those that\narise from stellar features such as spots. Without fitting stellar models to\nspectral data, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from\nnoisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of\ntransiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to\nrelate the time scales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the\nexoplanets. Making use of data obtained with ground-based and space-based\nobservations we have tested our approach on HD 189733b. Moreover, we have\ninvestigated the use of this technique in measuring planetary orbital motion\nvia Doppler shift detection. Finally, we have analyzed synthetic spectra\nobtained using the SOAP 2.0 tool, which simulates a stellar spectrum and the\ninfluence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one\norbital period. We have demonstrated that, so long as the signal-to-noise-ratio\n$\\ge$ 75, our approach reconstructs the planetary orbital period, as well as\nthe rotation period of a spot on the stellar surface.\n", "  Crystal structure prediction methods and first-principles calculations have\nbeen used to explore low-energy structures of carbon monoxide (CO). Contrary to\nthe standard wisdom, the most stable structure of CO at ambient pressure was\nfound to be a polymeric structure of Pna21 symmetry rather than a molecular\nsolid. This phase is formed from six-membered (4 Carbon + 2 Oxygen) rings\nconnected by C=C double bonds with two double-bonded oxygen atoms attached to\neach ring. Interestingly, the polymeric Pna21 phase of CO has a much higher\nenergy density than trinitrotoluene (TNT). On compression to about 7 GPa, Pna21\nis found to transform into another chain-like phase of Cc symmetry which has\nsimilar ring units to Pna21. On compression to 100 GPa it is energetically\nfavorable for CO to polymerize to form a single-bonded Cmcm phase from another\nstructure of Cmca symmetry composed of units similar to those found in the\nsingle-bonded I212121 structure. Thermodynamic stability of these structures\nwas verified using calculations with different density functionals, including\nhybrid and van der Waals corrected functionals.\n", "  We investigate the electric and thermal transport properties in a disordered\nWeyl ferromagnet on an equal footing by using the Keldysh formalism in curved\nspacetime. In particular, we calculate the anomalous thermal Hall conductivity,\nwhich consists of the Kubo formula and the heat magnetization, without relying\non the Wiedemann-Franz law. We take nonmagnetic impurities into account within\nthe self-consistent $T$-matrix approximation and reproduce the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw for the extrinsic Fermi-surface and intrinsic Fermi-sea terms,\nrespectively. This is the first step towards a unified theory of the anomalous\nHall effect at finite temperature, where we should take into account both\ndisorder and interactions.\n", "  This work deals with an investigation of general principles of\nsuperplasticity (SP) in deformed materials. It is shown that a non-linear, wave\nplastic deformation is the basic process for all plastic deformation phenomena,\nit makes an individual contribution into these phenomena, allows describing\nthem from the same standpoints, and offers a way to follow the relationship\nbetween the physics of defects and the mechanics of plasticity. It is to be\nnoted that macro and meso defects - discontinuities in the vector fields of\nmacro and meso elastic displacements, are no less fundamental than are the\nmicrodefects - dislocations and disclinations, it is the latter which form the\nprocess of localized macrodeformation. General mechanisms of this process are\nanalyzed in this study. Constitutive equation of superplastic state is\nobtained, which relates the strain rate, its rotational modes, local\nirreversible stresses, temperature, and density of heat and mass transfer.\nSpecial cases and their derived relations are analyzed. It is shown that SP is\ndetermined by plastic equilibrium concurrent with the composition and structure\nfluctuations. An expression is obtained for the superplastic flow velocity,\ncontaining three terms: velocity of wave plastic macroprocess, increased by\nfluctuations, velocity prescribed by the gradient of external sources\n(diffusion, etc.), and velocity of the delayed intragranular slip. It should be\nnoted that transformation is a characteristic and necessary feature of SP flow.\nIn the absence of transformations, deformation occurs via creep. Fragmentation\nof the deforming region and grain-boundary sliding (GBS) are discussed and so\nare their mechanisms and characteristic features. Formulas are derived for the\nstrain rate under conditions of GBS and the reasons for its non-monotonic\ndependence on grain size, applied stresses and temperature are analyzed.\n", "  Interface states in photonic crystals usually require defects or\nsurface/interface decorations. We show here that one can control interface\nstates in 1D photonic crystals through the engineering of geometrical phase\nsuch that interface states can be guaranteed in even or odd, or in all photonic\nbandgaps. We verify experimentally the designed interface states in 1D\nmultilayered photonic crystals fabricated by electron beam vapor deposition. We\nalso obtain the geometrical phases by measuring the reflection phases at the\nbandgaps of the PCs and achieve good agreement with the theory. Our approach\ncould provide a platform for the design of using interface states in photonic\ncrystals for nonlinear optic, sensing, and lasing applications\n", "  The Weyl semimetal, due to a non-zero energy difference in the pair of Weyl\nnodes shows chiral magnetic effect(CME). This leads to a flow of\ndissipationless electric current along an applied magnetic field. Such a chiral\nmagnetic effect in Weyl semimetals has been studied using the laws of classical\nelectrodynamics. It has been shown that the CME in a such a semimetal changes\nthe properties namely, frequency dependent skin depth, capacitive transport,\nplasma frequency etc. in an unconventional way as compared to the conventional\nmetals. In the low frequency regime, the properties are controlled by a natural\nlength scale due to CME called the chiral magnetic length. Further, unlike the\nconventional metals, the plasma frequency in this case is shown to be strongly\nmagnetic field-dependent. Since the plasma frequency lies below the optical\nfrequency, the Weyl semimetals will look transparent. Such new and novel\nobservations might help in exploiting these class of materials in potential\napplications which could completely change the future technology.\n", "  Moir\\'e patterns are common in Van der Waals heterostructures and can be used\nto apply periodic potentials to elementary excitations. We show that the\noptical absorption spectrum of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers is\nprofoundly altered by long period moir\\'e patterns that introduce twist-angle\ndependent satellite excitonic peaks. Topological exciton bands with non-zero\nChern numbers that support chiral excitonic edge states can be engineered by\ncombining three ingredients: i) the valley Berry phase induced by electron-hole\nexchange interactions, ii) the moir\\'e potential, and iii) the valley Zeeman\nfield.\n", "  We have carried out a comprehensive study of the intrinsic anomalous Hall\neffect and spin Hall effect of several chiral antiferromagnetic compounds,\nMn$_3X$ ($X$ = Ge, Sn, Ga, Ir, Rh and Pt) by $ab~initio$ band structure and\nBerry phase calculations. These studies reveal large and anisotropic values of\nboth the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect and spin Hall effect. The Mn$_3X$\nmaterials exhibit a non-collinear antiferromagnetic order which, to avoid\ngeometrical frustration, forms planes of Mn moments that are arranged in a\nKagome-type lattice. With respect to these Kagome planes, we find that both the\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) are\nquite anisotropic for any of these materials. Based on our calculations, we\npropose how to maximize AHC and SHC for different materials. The band\nstructures and corresponding electron filling, that we show are essential to\ndetermine the AHC and SHC, are compared for these different compounds. We point\nout that Mn$_3$Ga shows a large SHC of about 600 $(\\hbar/e)(\\Omega\\cdot\ncm)^{-1}$. Our work provides insights into the realization of strong anomalous\nHall effects and spin Hall effects in chiral antiferromagetic materials.\n", "  We have implemented recently developed multiple-projector pseudopotentials\ninto the planewave based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (pw-AFQMC) method.\nMultiple-projector pseudopotentials can yield smaller planewave cut-offs while\nmaintaining or improving transferability. This reduces the computational cost\nof pw-AFQMC, increasing its reach to larger and more complicated systems. We\ndiscuss the use of non-local pseudopotentials in the separable\nKleinman-Bylander form, and the implementation in pw-AFQMC of the\nmultiple-projector optimized norm-conserving pseudopotential ONCVPSP of Hamann.\nThe accuracy of the method is first demonstrated by equation-of-state\ncalculations of the ionic insulator NaCl and more strongly correlated metal Cu.\nThe method is then applied to calibrate the accuracy of density functional\ntheory (DFT) predictions of the phase stability of recently discovered high\ntemperature and pressure superconducting sulfur hydride systems. We find that\nDFT results are in good agreement with pw-AFQMC, due to near cancellation of\nelectron-electron correlation effects between different structures.\n", "  Dynamical polarization of nuclear spin ensembles is of central importance for\nmagnetic resonance studies, precision sensing and for applications in quantum\ninformation theory. Here we propose a scheme to generate long-lived singlet\npairs in an unpolarized nuclear spin ensemble which is dipolar coupled to the\nelectron spins of a Nitrogen Vacancy center in diamond. The quantum mechanical\nback-action induced by frequent spin-selective readout of the NV centers allows\nthe nuclear spins to pair up into maximally entangled singlet pairs.\nCounterintuitively, the robustness of the pair formation to dephasing noise\nimproves with increasing size of the spin ensemble. We also show how the paired\nnuclear spin state allows for enhanced sensing capabilities of NV centers in\ndiamond.\n", "  In this article, by considering Bell-diagonal two-qubit initial states\nsubmitted to local dynamics generated by the phase damping, bit flip, phase\nflip, bit-phase flip, and depolarizing channels, we report some elegant\ndirect-dynamical relations between geometric measures of entanglement and\ndiscord. The complex scenario appearing already in this simplified case study\nindicates that similarly simple relation shall hardly be found in more general\nsituations.\n", "  We provide an alternative method for obtaining of compatible Poisson\nstructures on Lie groups by means of the adjoint representations of Lie\nalgebras. In this way, we calculate some compatible Poisson structures on four\ndimensional and nilpotent six dimensional symplectic real Lie groups. Then\nusing Magri-Morosi's theorem we obtain new bi-Hamiltonian systems with four\ndimensional and nilpotent six dimensional symplectic real Lie groups as phase\nspaces.\n", "  We develop a formally exact technique for obtaining steady-state\ndistributions of non-interacting active Brownian particles in a variety of\nsystems. Our technique draws on results from the theory of two-way diffusion\nequations to solve the steady-state Smoluchowski equation for the 1-particle\ndistribution function. The methods are employed to study in detail three\nscenarios: 1) confinement in a channel, 2) a constant flux steady state, and 3)\nsedimentation in a uniform external field. In each scenario, known behaviors\nare reproduced and precisely quantified, and new results are presented. In\nparticular, in the constant flux state we derive an effective diffusivity which\ninterpolates between the ballistic behavior of particle trajectories at short\ndistances and their diffusive behavior at large distances. We also calculate\nthe sedimentation profile of active Brownian particles near a wall, which\ncomplements earlier studies on the part far from the wall. Our techniques\neasily generalize to other active models, including systems whose activity is\nmodeled in terms of Gaussian colored noise.\n", "  In this work we report a new result that appears when one investigates the\nroute that starts from a scalar field theory and ends on a supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics. The subject has been studied before in several distinct ways\nand here we unveil an interesting novelty, showing that the same scalar field\nmodel may describe distinct quantum mechanical problems.\n", "  We discuss the recent proposal of arXiv:1608.05351 about generalization of\nthe RTT relation to network matrix models. We show that the RTT relation in\nthese models is modified by a nontrivial, but essentially abelian anomaly\ncocycle, which we explicitly evaluate for the free field representations of the\nquantum toroidal algebra. This cocycle is responsible for the braiding, which\npermutes the external legs in the q-deformed conformal block and its 5d/6d\ngauge theory counterpart, i.e. the non-perturbative Nekrasov functions. Thus,\nit defines their modular properties and symmetry. We show how to cancel the\nanomaly using a construction somewhat similar to the anomaly matching condition\nin gauge theory. We also describe the singular limit to the affine Yangian (4d\nNekrasov functions), which breaks the spectral duality.\n", "  We investigate the cross-correlation signal between 21cm intensity mapping\nmaps and the Lyman-alpha forest in the fully non-linear regime using\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations. The cross-correlation signal between\nthese fields can provide a coherent and comprehensive picture of the neutral\nhydrogen (HI) content of our Universe in the post-reionization era, probing\nboth its mass content and volume distribution. We compute the auto-power\nspectra of both fields together with their cross-power spectrum at z = 2.4 and\nfind that on large scales the fields are completely anti-correlated. This\nanti-correlation arises because regions with high (low) 21cm emission, such as\nthose with a large (low) concentration of damped Lyman-alpha systems, will show\nup as regions with low (high) transmitted flux. We find that on scales smaller\nthan k = 0.2 h/Mpc the cross-correlation coefficient departs from -1, at a\nscale where non-linearities show up. We use the anisotropy of the power spectra\nin redshift-space to determine the values of the bias and of the redshift-space\ndistortion parameters of both fields; we find that the errors on the value of\nthese parameters could decrease by 30% when adding data from the cross-power\nspectrum in a conservative analysis. Our results point out that linear theory\nis capable of reproducing the shape and amplitude of the cross-power up to\nrather non-linear scales. Finally, we find that the 21cm-Lya cross-power\nspectrum can be detected by combining data from a BOSS-like survey together\nwith 21cm intensity mapping observations by SKA1-MID with a S/N ratio higher\nthan 3 in the range 0.06< k <1 h/Mpc. We emphasize that while the shape and\namplitude of the 21cm auto-power spectrum can be severely affected by residual\nforeground contamination, cross-power spectra will be less sensitive to that\nand therefore can be used to identify systematics in the 21cm maps.\n", "  We have explored the possibilities of scenarios with heavy gluinos and light\nstops in supersymmetric (SUSY) standard models with extra vector-like\nmultiplets. If we assume the hierarchical structure for soft masses of the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) scalar fields and extra scalars,\nthe light stop and the observed Higgs boson can be realized. While the stau is\nthe lightest SUSY particle (LSP) in broad parameter space, we have found that\nthe neutralino LSP is realized in the case that the non-zero soft parameters\nfor the MSSM Higgs doublets or the non-universal gaugino masses are assumed.\n", "  The possibility that an unconventional depletion in the center of the charge\ndensity distribution of certain nuclei occurs due to a purely quantum\nmechanical effect has attracted theoretical and experimental attention in\nrecent years. We report on ab initio self-consistent Green's function\ncalculations of one of such candidates, $^{34}$Si, together with its Z+2\nneighbour $^{36}$S. Binding energies, rms radii and density distributions of\nthe two nuclei as well as low-lying spectroscopy of $^{35}$Si, $^{37}$S,\n$^{33}$Al and $^{35}$P are discussed. The interpretation of one-nucleon removal\nand addition spectra in terms of the evolution of the underlying shell\nstructure is also provided. The study is repeated using several chiral\neffective field theory Hamiltonians as a way to test the robustness of the\nresults with respect to input inter-nucleon interactions. The prediction\nregarding the (non-)existence of the bubble structure in $^{34}$Si varies\nsignificantly with the nuclear Hamiltonian used. However, demanding that the\nexperimental charge density distribution and the root mean square radius of\n$^{36}$S are well reproduced, along with $^{34}$Si and $^{36}$S binding\nenergies, only leaves the NNLO$_{\\text{sat}}$ Hamiltonian as a serious\ncandidate to perform this prediction. In this context, a bubble structure,\nwhose fingerprint should be visible in an electron scattering experiment of\n$^{34}$Si, is predicted. Furthermore, a clear correlation is established\nbetween the occurrence of the bubble structure and the weakening of the\n1/2$^-$-3/2$^-$ splitting in the spectrum of $^{35}$Si as compared to $^{37}$S.\n", "  Radical-ion pairs and their reactions have triggered the study of quantum\neffects in biological systems. This is because they exhibit a number of effects\nbest understood within quantum information science, and at the same time are\ncentral in understanding the avian magnetic compass and the spin transport\ndynamics in photosynthetic reaction centers. Here we address radical-pair\nreactions from the perspective of quantum metrology. Since the coherent spin\nmotion of radical-pairs is effected by an external magnetic field, these\nspin-dependent reactions essentially realize a biochemical magnetometer. Using\nthe quantum Fisher information, we find the fundamental quantum limits to the\nmagnetic sensitivity of radical-pair magnetometers. We then explore how well\nthe usual measurement scheme considered in radical-pair reactions, the\nmeasurement of reaction yields, approaches the fundamental limits. In doing so,\nwe find the optimal hyperfine interaction Hamiltonian that leads to the best\nmagnetic sensitivity as obtained from reaction yields. This is still an order\nof magnitude smaller than the absolute quantum limit. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat with a realistic quantum reaction control reminding of Ramsey\ninterferometry, here presented as a quantum circuit involving the spin-exchange\ninteraction and a recently proposed molecular switch, we can approach the\nfundamental quantum limit within a factor of 2. This work opens the application\nof well-advanced quantum metrology methods to biological systems.\n", "  The contact is an important concept that characterizes the universal\nproperties of a strongly interacting quantum gas. It appears in both\nthermodynamic (energy, pressure, etc.) and dynamic quantities (radio-frequency\nand Bragg spectroscopies, etc.) of the system. Very recently, the concept of\ncontact has been extended to higher partial waves, in particular, the p-wave\ncontacts have been experimentally probed in recent experiment. So far\ndiscussions on p-wave contacts have been limited to three-dimensions. In this\npaper, we generalize the p-wave contacts to two-dimensions and derive a series\nof universal relations, including the adiabatic relations, high momentum\ndistribution, virial theorem and pressure relation. At high temperature and low\ndensity limit, we calculated the p-wave contacts explicitly using virial\nexpansion. A formula which directly connects the shift of the breathing mode\nfrequency and the p-wave contacts are given in a harmonically trapped system.\nFinally, we also derive the relationships between interaction parameters in\nthree and two dimensional Fermi gas and discuss possible experimental\nrealization of two dimensional Fermi gas with p-wave interactions.\n", "  We demonstrate a two-photon transition of rubidium (Rb) atoms from the ground\nstate (5$S_{1/2}$) to the excited state (4$D_{5/2}$), using a home-built\nytterbium (Yb)-doped fiber amplifier at 1033 nm. This is the first\ndemonstration of an atomic frequency reference at 1033 nm as well as of a\none-colour two-photon transition for the above energy levels. A simple optical\nsetup is presented for the two-photon transition fluorescence spectroscopy,\nwhich is useful for frequency stabilization for a broad class of lasers. This\nspectroscopy has potential applications in the fiber laser industry as a\nfrequency reference, particularly for the Yb-doped fiber lasers. This\ntwo-photon transition also has applications in atomic physics as a background-\nfree high- resolution atom detection and for quantum communication, which is\noutlined in this article.\n", "  We review the pertinent features of the phase diagram of the zero-field\nBlume-Capel model, focusing on the aspects of transition order, finite-size\nscaling and universality. In particular, we employ a range of Monte Carlo\nsimulation methods to study the 2D spin-1 Blume-Capel model on the square\nlattice to investigate the behavior in the vicinity of the first-order and\nsecond-order regimes of the ferromagnet-paramagnet phase boundary,\nrespectively. To achieve high-precision results, we utilize a combination of\n(i) a parallel version of the multicanonical algorithm and (ii) a hybrid\nupdating scheme combining Metropolis and generalized Wolff cluster moves. These\ntechniques are combined to study for the first time the correlation length of\nthe model, using its scaling in the regime of second-order transitions to\nillustrate universality through the observed identity of the limiting value of\n$\\xi/L$ with the exactly known result for the Ising universality class.\n", "  We study the mechanical fluctuations of a micrometer sized silicon cantilever\nsubjected to a strong heat flow, thus having a highly non-uniform local\ntemperature. In this non-equilibrium steady state, we show that fluctuations\nare equivalent to the thermal noise of a cantilever at equilibrium around room\ntemperature, while its mean local temperature is several hundred of degrees\nhigher. Changing the mechanical dissipation by adding a coating to the\ncantilever, we recover the expected rise of fluctuations with the mean\ntemperature. Our work demonstrates that inhomogeneous dissipation mechanisms\ncan decouple the amplitude of thermal fluctuations from the average\ntemperature. This property could be useful to understand out-of-equilibrium\nfluctuating systems, or to engineer low noise instruments.\n", "  The 2016 Physics Nobel Prize honors a variety of discoveries related to\ntopological phases and phase transitions. Here we sketch two exciting facets:\nthe groundbreaking works by John Kosterlitz and David Thouless on phase\ntransitions of infinite order, and by Duncan Haldane on the energy gaps in\nquantum spin chains. These insights came as surprises in the 1970s and 1980s,\nrespectively, and they have both initiated new fields of research in\ntheoretical and experimental physics.\n", "  We present a theoretical study on the effect of radiation on the\nmangetoresistance of two-dimensional electron systems with strong Rashba\nspint-orbit coupling. We want to study the interplay between two well-known\neffects in these electron systems: the radiation-induced resistance\noscillations and the typical beating pattern of systems with intense Rashba\ninteraction. We analytically derive an exact solution for the electron wave\nfunction corresponding to a total Hamiltonian with Rashba and radiation terms.\nWe consider a perturbation treatment for elastic scattering due to charged\nimpurities to finally obtain the magnetoresistance of the system. Without\nradiation we recover a beating pattern in the amplitude of the Shubnikov de\nHass oscillations: a set of nodes and antinodes in the magnetoresistance. In\nthe presence of radiation this beating pattern is strongly modified following\nthe profile of radiation-induced magnetoresistance oscillations. We study their\ndependence on intensity and frequency of radiation, including the teraherzt\nregime.\n", "  We systematically study, in the context of the standard cold dark matter\nmodel, star-formation suppression effects of two important known physical\nprocesses---photoheating due to reionization of the intergalactic medium and\ngravitational shock heating due to formation of massive halos and large-scale\nstructure---on the global evolution of star formation rate (SFR) density and\nthe so-called cosmic downsizing phenomenon in the redshift range z=0-6. We show\nthat the steep decline of cosmic SFR density from z~2 to z=0 can be primarily\nexplained by gravitational shock heating in two forms: massive halo\nself-quenching and hot environment. Simultaneously, we show a decreasing trend\nin the average SFR of star-forming galaxies from z=2 to z=0, reproducing the\nobserved cosmic downsizing at z<2. Nevertheless, the average halo mass of\nstar-forming galaxies is found to continue upsizing from z=2 to z=0. In stark\ncontrast to z<2, both photoheating and gravitational shock heating effects are\nfound to play a minor role in suppressing star formation. Additional negative\nfeedback effects are required to reconcile our model with observations at z>2.\nInternal feedback from stellar evolution and supermassive black hole growth are\nthe natural candidates for this role, as galaxies at z>2 are more moderate in\nmass but stronger in star formation and are thus more vulnerable. Our physical\nmodel can be used to treat star formation in cosmological N-body simulations.\n", "  The one-particle density matrix of the one-dimensional Tonks-Girardeau gas\nwith inhomogeneous density profile is calculated, thanks to a recent\nobservation that relates this system to a two-dimensional conformal field\ntheory in curved space. The result is asymptotically exact in the limit of\nlarge particle density and small density variation, and holds for arbitrary\ntrapping potentials. In the particular case of a harmonic trap, we recover a\nformula obtained by Forrester et al. [Phys. Rev. A 67, 043607 (2003)] from a\ndifferent method.\n", "  Phonon-cavity electromechanics allows the manipulation of mechanical\noscillations similar to photon-cavity systems. Many advances on this subject\nhave been achieved in various materials. In addition, the coherent phonon\ntransfer (phonon Rabi oscillations) between the phonon cavity mode and another\noscillation mode has attracted many interest in nano-science. Here we\ndemonstrate coherent phonon transfer in a carbon nanotube phonon-cavity system\nwith two mechanical modes exhibiting strong dynamical coupling. The\ngate-tunable phonon oscillation modes are manipulated and detected by extending\nthe red-detuned pump idea of photonic cavity electromechanics. The first- and\nsecond-order coherent phonon transfers are observed with Rabi frequencies 591\nkHz and 125 kHz, respectively. The frequency quality factor product\nfQ_m~2=10^12 Hz achieved here is larger thank k_B T_base/h, which may enable\nthe future realization of Rabi oscillations in the quantum regime.\n", "  Spectra observed with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES)\non the European Southern Observatory's VLT exhibit long-range wavelength\ndistortions. These distortions impose a systematic error on high-precision\nmeasurements of the fine-structure constant, $\\alpha$, derived from intervening\nquasar absorption systems. If the distortion is modelled using a model that is\ntoo simplistic, the resulting bias in $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ away from the true\nvalue can be larger than the statistical uncertainty on the $\\alpha$\nmeasurement. If the effect is ignored altogether, the same is true. If the\neffect is modelled properly, accounting for the way in which final spectra are\ngenerally formed from the co-addition of exposures made at several different\ninstrumental settings, the effect can be accurately removed and the correct\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ recovered.\n", "  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory has been fully\noperational since March 2015. To improve its sensitivity at the highest\nenergies, it is being upgraded with an additional sparse array called outrigger\narray. We will discuss in this contribution, the different outrigger array\ncomponents, and the simulation results to optimize it.\n", "  In this paper we present a phantom solution with a big rip singularity in a\nnon-linear regime of the Israel-Stewart formalism. In this framework it is\npossible to extend this causal formalism in order to describe accelerated\nexpansion, where assumption of near equilibrium is no longer valid. We assume a\nflat universe filled with a single viscous fluid ruled by a barotropic EoS,\n$p=\\omega \\rho$, which can represent a late time accelerated phase of the\ncosmic evolution. The solution allows to cross the phantom divide without\nevoking an exotic matter fluid and the effective EoS parameter is always lesser\nthan $-1$ and constant in time.\n", "  We study a dilute and ultracold Bose gas of interacting atoms by using an\neffective field theory which takes account finite-range effects of the\ninter-atomic potential. Within the formalism of functional integration from the\ngrand canonical partition function we derive beyond-mean-field analytical\nresults which depend on both scattering length and effective range of the\ninteraction. In particular, we calculate the equation of state of the bosonic\nsystem as a function of these interaction parameters both at zero and finite\ntemperature including one-loop Gaussian fluctuation. In the case of zero-range\neffective interaction we explicitly show that, due to quantum fluctuations, the\nbosonic system is thermodynamically stable only for very small values of the\ngas parameter. We find that a positive effective range above a critical\nthreshold is necessary to remove the thermodynamical instability of the uniform\nconfiguration. Remarkably, also for relatively large values of the gas\nparameter, our finite-range results are in quite good agreement with recent\nzero-temperature Monte Carlo calculations obtained with hard-sphere bosons.\n", "  Hot white dwarf stars are the ideal probe for a relationship between the\nfine-structure constant and strong gravitational fields, providing us with an\nopportunity for a direct observational test. We study a sample of hot white\ndwarf stars, combining far-UV spectroscopic observations, atomic physics,\natmospheric modelling and fundamental physics, in the search for variation in\nthe fine structure constant. This variation manifests as shifts in the observed\nwavelengths of absorption lines, such as quadruply ionized iron (FeV) and\nquadruply ionized nickel (NiV), when compared to laboratory wavelengths.\nBerengut et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 111, 010801) demonstrated the validity\nof such an analysis using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra of G191-B2B. We have made three\nimportant improvements by: (a) using three new independent sets of laboratory\nwavelengths, (b) analysing a sample of objects, and (c) improving the\nmethodology by incorporating robust techniques from previous studies towards\nquasars (the Many Multiplet method). A successful detection would be the first\ndirect measurement of a gravitational field effect on a bare constant of\nnature. Here we describe our approach and present preliminary results from nine\nobjects using both FeV and NiV.\n", "  Absorption imaging of ultracold atoms is the foundation for quantitative\nextraction of information from experiments with ultracold atoms. Due to the\nlimited exposure time available in these systems, the signal-to-noise ratio is\nlargest for high intensity absorption imaging where the intensity of the\nimaging light is on the order of the saturation intensity. In this case, the\nabsolute value of the intensity of the imaging light enters as an additional\nparameter making it more sensitive to systematic errors. Here, we present a\nnovel and robust technique to determine the imaging intensity in units of the\neffective saturation intensity to better than 5%. We do this by measuring the\nmomentum transferred to the atoms by the imaging light while varying its\nintensity. We further utilize the method to quantify the purity of the\npolarization of the imaging light and to determine the correct imaging\ndetuning.\n", "  Among the family of TMDs, ReS2 takes a special position, which crystalizes in\na unique distorted low-symmetry structure at ambient conditions. The interlayer\ninteraction in ReS2 is rather weak, thus its bulk properties are similar to\nthat of monolayer. However, how does compression change its structure and\nelectronic properties is unknown so far. Here using ab initio crystal structure\nsearching techniques, we explore the high-pressure phase transitions of ReS2\nextensively and predict two new high-pressure phases. The ambient pressure\nphase transforms to a \"distorted-1T\" structure at very low pressure and then to\na tetragonal I41/amd structure at around 90 GPa. The \"distorted-1T\" structure\nundergoes a semiconductor-metal transition (SMT) at around 70 GPa with a band\noverlap mechanism. Electron-phonon calculations suggest that the I41/amd\nstructure is superconducting and has a critical superconducting temperature of\nabout 2 K at 100 GPa. We further perform high-pressure electrical resistance\nmeasurements up to 102 GPa. Our experiments confirm the SMT and the\nsuperconducting phase transition of ReS2 under high pressure. These\nexperimental results are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions.\n", "  In the last few years, microblogging platforms such as Twitter have given\nrise to a deluge of textual data that can be used for the analysis of informal\ncommunication between millions of individuals. In this work, we propose an\ninformation-theoretic approach to geographic language variation using a corpus\nbased on Twitter. We test our models with tens of concepts and their associated\nkeywords detected in Spanish tweets geolocated in Spain. We employ\ndialectometric measures (cosine similarity and Jensen-Shannon divergence) to\nquantify the linguistic distance on the lexical level between cells created in\na uniform grid over the map. This can be done for a single concept or in the\ngeneral case taking into account an average of the considered variants. The\nlatter permits an analysis of the dialects that naturally emerge from the data.\nInterestingly, our results reveal the existence of two dialect macrovarieties.\nThe first group includes a region-specific speech spoken in small towns and\nrural areas whereas the second cluster encompasses cities that tend to use a\nmore uniform variety. Since the results obtained with the two different metrics\nqualitatively agree, our work suggests that social media corpora can be\nefficiently used for dialectometric analyses.\n", "  The electrical transport properties of anodically grown TiO2 nanotubes was\ninvestigated. Amorphous nanotubes were anodically grown on titanium foil and\ntransformed through annealing into the anatase phase. Amorphous and\npolycrystalline single nanotubes were isolated and contacted for measurements\nof the electrical resistance. Non-linear current-voltage characteristics were\nexplained using the fluctuation induced tunneling conduction model. A clear\nenhancement of the conductance was induced in an insulating anatase nanotube\nthrough low-energy Ar/H ion irradiation. Confocal Raman spectroscopy shows that\nthe annealed samples were in anatase phase and a blueshift due to phonon\nconfinement was observed.\n", "  Topological quantum matter and spintronics research have been developed to a\nlarge extent independently. In this Review we discuss a new role that the\nantiferromagnetic order has taken in combining topological matter and\nspintronics. This occurs due to the complex microscopic symmetries present in\nantiferromagnets that allow, e.g., for topological relativistic quasiparticles\nand the newly discovered N\\'{e}el spin-orbit torques to coexist. We first\nintroduce the concepts of topological semimetals and spin-orbitronics.\nSecondly, we explain the antiferromagnetic symmetries on a minimal Dirac\nsemimetal model and the guiding role of $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculations in\npredictions of examples of Dirac, and Weyl antiferromagnets:\nSrMnBi$_{\\text{2}}$, CuMnAs, and Mn$_{\\text{3}}$Ge. Lastly, we illustrate the\ninterplay of Dirac quasiparticles, topology and antiferromagnetism on: (i) the\nexperimentally observed quantum Hall effect in EuMnBi$_{\\text{2}}$, (ii) the\nlarge anomalous Hall effect in Mn$_{\\text{3}}$Ge, and (iii) the theoretically\npredicted topological metal-insulator transition in CuMnAs.\n", "  Time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation is solved for type II superconductors\nnumerically, and the dynamics of entering vortices, geometric defects and\npinning effects have been investigated. A superconducting wire with ratchet\ndefects is designed to pump the vortices move in a specific direction and\nenhance the supercurrent when applying the periodical magnetic field. Some\nproperties of this wire have been investigated numerically and analytically.\n", "  We present a high performance solution to the Wiener filtering problem via a\nformulation that is dual to the recently developed messenger technique. This\nnew dual messenger algorithm, like its predecessor, efficiently calculates the\nWiener filter solution of large and complex data sets without preconditioning\nand can account for inhomogeneous noise distributions and arbitrary mask\ngeometries. We demonstrate the capabilities of this scheme in signal\nreconstruction by applying it on a simulated cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ntemperature data set. The performance of this new method is compared to that of\nthe standard messenger algorithm and the preconditioned conjugate gradient\n(PCG) approach, using a series of well-known convergence diagnostics and their\nprocessing times, for the particular problem under consideration. This variant\nof the messenger algorithm matches the performance of the PCG method in terms\nof the effectiveness of reconstruction of the input angular power spectrum and\nconverges smoothly to the final solution. The dual messenger algorithm\noutperforms the standard messenger and PCG methods in terms of execution time,\nas it runs to completion around 2 and 3-4 times faster than the respective\nmethods, for the specific problem considered.\n", "  Vortices are commonly observed in the context of classical hydrodynamics:\nfrom whirlpools after stirring the coffee in a cup to a violent atmospheric\nphenomenon such as a tornado, all classical vortices are characterized by an\narbitrary circulation value of the local velocity field. On the other hand the\nappearance of vortices with quantized circulation represents one of the\nfundamental signatures of macroscopic quantum phenomena. In two-dimensional\nsuperfluids quantized vortices play a key role in determining\nfinite-temperature properties, as the superfluid phase and the normal state are\nseparated by a vortex unbinding transition, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition. Very recent experiments with two-dimensional superfluid fermions\nmotivate the present work: we present theoretical results based on the\nrenormalization group showing that the universal jump of the superfluid density\nand the critical temperature crucially depend on the interaction strength,\nproviding a strong benchmark for forthcoming investigations.\n", "  DAMPE is a space-based mission designed as a high energy particle detector\nmeasuring cosmic-rays and $\\gamma-$rays which was successfully launched on\nDec.17, 2015. The BGO electromagnetic calorimeter is one of the key\nsub-detectors of DAMPE for energy measurement of electromagnetic showers\nproduced by $e^{\\pm}/{\\gamma}$. Due to energy loss in dead material and energy\nleakage outside the calorimeter, the deposited energy in BGO underestimates the\nprimary energy of incident $e^{\\pm}/{\\gamma}$. In this paper, based on detailed\nMC simulations, a parameterized energy correction method using the lateral and\nlongitudinal information of electromagnetic showers has been studied and\nverified with data of electron beam test at CERN. The measurements of energy\nlinearity and resolution are significantly improved by applying this correction\nmethod for electromagnetic showers.\n", "  Analytical expressions of the relativistic effective degrees of freedom\n$g_\\ast$ with non-pure fermionic neutrinos are presented. A semi-analytical\nstudy is performed to show that $g_\\ast$ with pure fermionic neutrinos may be\ngreater than $g_\\ast$ with pure bosonic neutrinos for non-vanishing lepton\nflavor asymmetries.\n", "  In several settings of physics and chemistry one has to deal with molecules\ninteracting with some kind of an external environment, be it a gas, a solution,\nor a crystal surface. Understanding molecular processes in the presence of such\na many-particle bath is inherently challenging, and usually requires\nlarge-scale numerical computations. Here, we present an alternative approach to\nthe problem - that based on the notion of the angulon quasiparticle. We show\nthat molecules rotating inside superfluid helium nanodroplets and Bose-Einstein\nCondensates form angulons, and therefore can be described by straightforward\nsolutions of a simple microscopic Hamiltonian. Casting the problem in the\nlanguage of angulons allows not only to tremendously simplify it, but also to\ngain insights into the origins of the observed phenomena and to make\npredictions for future experimental studies.\n", "  Three-dimensional (3D) topological Dirac semimetals (TDSs) are rare but\nimportant as a versatile platform for exploring exotic electronic properties\nand topological phase transitions. A quintessential feature of TDSs is 3D Dirac\nfermions associated with bulk electronic states near the Fermi level. Using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have observed such bulk\nDirac cones in epitaxially-grown {\\alpha}-Sn films on InSb(111), the first such\nTDS system realized in an elemental form. First-principles calculations confirm\nthat epitaxial strain is key to the formation of the TDS phase. A phase diagram\nis established that connects the 3D TDS phase through a singular point of a\nzero-gap semimetal phase to a topological insulator (TI) phase. The nature of\nthe Dirac cone crosses over from 3D to 2D as the film thickness is reduced.\n", "  We study asymptotics of $q$-distributed random lozenge tilings of sawtooth\ndomains (equivalently, of random interlacing integer arrays with fixed top\nrow). Under the distribution we consider each tiling is weighted proportionally\nto $q^{\\mathsf{vol}}$, where $\\mathsf{vol}$ is the volume under the\ncorresponding 3D stepped surface. We prove the following Interlacing Central\nLimit Theorem: as $q\\rightarrow1$, the domain gets large, and the fixed top row\napproximates a given nonrandom profile, the vertical lozenges are distributed\nas the eigenvalues of a GUE random matrix and of its successive principal\ncorners. Our results extend the GUE corners asymptotics for tilings of bounded\npolygonal domains previously known in the uniform (i.e., $q=1$) case. Even\nthough $q$ goes to $1$, the presence of the $q$-weighting affects non-universal\nconstants in our Central Limit Theorem.\n", "  The concept of a hybrid readout of a time projection chamber is presented. It\ncombines a GEM-based amplification and a pad-based anode plane with a pixel\nchip as readout electronics. This way, a high granularity enabling to identify\nelectron clusters from the primary ionisation is achieved as well as\nflexibility and large anode coverage. The benefits of this high granularity, in\nparticular for dE/dx measurements, are outlined and the current software and\nhardware development status towards a proof-of-principle is given.\n", "  The contribution contains the preface to the Proceedings to the 19th Workshop\n\"What Comes Beyond the Standard Models\", Bled, July 11 - 19, 2016, published in\nBled workshops in physics, Vol.17, No. 2, DMFA-Zaloznistvo, Ljubljana, Dec.\n2016, links to (most of) the published contributions and section (by M.Yu.\nKhlopov) on VIA at Bled 2016.\n", "  The magnetic structure of the heavy fermion antiferromagnet CePt$_2$In$_7$ is\ndetermined using neutron diffraction. We find a magnetic wave vector\n$\\mathbf{q}_M = (1/2,1/2,1/2)$, which is temperature independent up to $T_N =$\n5.5 K. A staggered moment of 0.45(1)$\\mu_B$ at 2 K resides on the Ce ion. The\nnearest-neighbor moments in the tetragonal basal plane are aligned\nantiferromagnetically. The moments rotate by 90$^\\circ$ from one CeIn$_3$ plane\nto another along the $c$ axis. A much weaker satellite peak with an\nincommensurate magnetic wave vector $\\mathbf{q}_M = (1/2,1/2,0.47)$ seems to\ndevelop at low temperature. However, the experimental data available so far are\nnot sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion about the possible co-existence\nof commensurate and incommensurate magnetic structures in this material.\n", "  In Regge calculus the space-time manifold is approximated by certain abstract\nsimplicial complex, called a pseudo-manifold, and the metric is approximated by\nan assignment of a length to each 1-simplex. In this paper for each\npseudomanifold we construct a smooth manifold which we call a manifold with\ndefects. This manifold emerges from the purely combinatorial simplicial complex\nas a result of gluing geometric realizations of its n-simplices followed by\nremoving the simplices of dimension n-2. The Regge geometry is encoded in a\nboundary data of a BF-theory on this manifold. We construct an action\nfunctional which coincides with the standard BF action for suitably regular\nmanifolds with defects and fields. On the other hand, the action evaluated at\nsolutions of the field equations satisfying certain boundary conditions\ncoincides with an evaluation of the Regge action at Regge geometries defined by\nthe boundary data. As a result we trade the degrees of freedom of Regge\ncalculus for discrete degrees of freedom of topological BF theory.\n", "  We explore the relation between urban road network characteristics\nparticularly circuitry, street orientation entropy and the city's topography on\nthe one hand and the building's orientation entropy on the other in order to\nquantify their effect on the city's solar potential. These statistical measures\nof the road network reveal the interplay between the built environment's design\nand its sustainability.\n", "  Earth's lower mantle is generally believed to be seismically and chemically\nhomogeneous because most of the key seismic parameters can be explained using a\nsimplified mineralogical model at expected press-temperature conditions.\nHowever, recent high-resolution tomographic images have revealed seismic and\nchemical stratification in the middle-to-lower parts of the lower mantle. Thus\nfar, the mechanism for the compositional stratification and seismic\ninhomogeneity, especially their relationship with the speciation of iron in the\nlower mantle, remains poorly understood. We have built a complete and\nintegrated thermodynamic model of iron and aluminum chemistry for lower mantle\nconditions, and from this model has emerged a stratified picture of the\nvalence, spin and composition profile in the lower mantle. Within this picture\nthe lower mantle has an upper region with Fe3+ enriched bridgmanite with\nhigh-spin ferropericlase and metallic Fe, and a lower region with low-spin,\niron-enriched ferropericlase coexisting with iron-depleted bridgmanite and\nalmost no metallic Fe. The transition between the regions occurs at a depth of\naround 1600km and is driven by the spin transition in ferropericlase, which\nsignificantly changes the iron partitioning and speciation to one that favors\nFe2+ in ferropericlase and suppresses Fe3+ and metallic iron formation These\nchanges lead to lowered bulk sound velocity by 3-4% around the mid-lower mantle\nand enhanced density by ~1% toward the lowermost mantle. The predicted\nchemically and seismically stratified lower mantle differs dramatically from\nthe traditional homogeneous model.\n", "  This document reports an Open 2D Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) data\nset. The EIT measurements were collected from a circular body (a flat tank\nfilled with saline) with various choices of conductive and resistive\ninclusions. Data are available at http://fips.fi/ EIT_dataset.php and can be\nfreely used for scientific purposes with appropriate references to them, and to\nthis document at https://arxiv.org. The data set consists of (1) current\npatterns and voltage measurements of a circular tank containing different\ntargets, (2) photos of the tank and targets and (3) a MATLAB-code for reading\nthe data. A video report of the data collection session is available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Zca_qd1Y8.\n", "  Results are presented from an exploratory study involving x-ray irradiation\nof select deuterated materials. Titanium deuteride (TiD2) plus deuterated\npolyethylene ([-CD2-]n; DPE), DPE alone, and for control, hydrogen-based\npolyethylene ([-CH2-]n; HPE) samples and nondeuterated titanium samples were\nexposed to x-ray irradiation. These samples were exposed to various energy\nlevels from 65 to 280 kV with prescribed electron flux from 500 to 9000 micro-A\nimpinging on a tungsten braking target, with total exposure times ranging from\n55 to 280 min. Gamma activity was measured using a high-purity germanium (HPGe)\ndetector, and for all samples no gamma activity above background was detected.\nAlpha and beta activities were measured using a gas proportional counter, and\nfor select samples beta activity was measured with a liquid scintillator\nspectrometer. The majority of the deuterated materials subjected to the\nmicrofocus x-ray irradiation exhibited postexposure beta activity above\nbackground and several showed short-lived alpha activity. The HPE and\nnondeuterated titanium control samples exposed to the x-ray irradiation showed\nno postexposure alpha or beta activities above background. Several of the\nsamples (SL10A, SL16, SL17A) showed beta activity above background with a\ngreater than 4-sigma confidence level, months after exposure. Portions of\nSL10A, SL16, and SL17A samples were also scanned using a beta scintillator and\nfound to have beta activity in the tritium energy band, continuing without\nnoticeable decay for over 12 months. Beta scintillation investigation of\nas-received materials (before x-ray exposure) showed no beta activity in the\ntritium energy band, indicating the beta emitters were not in the starting\nmaterials.\n", "  We consider tunneling of spinless electrons from a single-channel emitter\ninto an empty collector through an interacting resonant level of the quantum\ndot. When all Coulomb screening of sudden charge variations of the dot during\nthe tunneling is realized by the emitter channel, the system is described with\nan exactly solvable model of a dissipative qubit. To study manifestations of\nthe coherent qubit dynamics in the collector $\\it{a.c.}$ response we derive\nsolution to the corresponding Bloch equation for the model quantum evolution in\nthe presence of the oscillating voltage of frequency $% \\omega$ and calculate\nperturbatively the $\\it{a.c.}$ response in the voltage amplitude. We have shown\nthat in a wide range of the model parameters the coherent qubit dynamics\nresults in the non-zero frequencies resonances in the amplitudes dependence of\nthe $\\it{a.c.}$ harmonics and in the jumps of the harmonics phase shifts across\nthe resonances. In the first order the $\\it{a.c.}$ response is directly related\nto the spectral decomposition of the corresponding transient current and\ncontains only the first $\\omega$ harmonic, whose amplitude exhibits resonance\nat $\\omega =\\omega_I $, where $\\omega_I$ is the qubit oscillation frequency. In\nthe second order we have obtained the $2 \\omega$ harmonic of the $\\it{a.c.}$\nresponse with resonances in the frequency dependence of its amplitude at\n$\\omega_I$, $\\omega_I/2$ and zero frequency and also have found the frequency\ndependent shift of the average steady current.\n", "  Einstein introduced the locality principle which states that all physical\neffect in some finite space-time region does not influence its space-like\nseparated finite region. Recently, in algebraic quantum field theory, R\\'{e}dei\ncaptured the idea of the locality principle by the notion of operational\nseparability. The operation in operational separability is performed in some\nfinite space-time region, and leaves unchanged the state in its space-like\nseparated finite space-time region. This operation is defined with a completely\npositive map. In the present paper, we justify using a completely positive map\nas a local operation in algebraic quantum field theory, and show that this\nlocal operation can be approximately written with Kraus operators under the\nfunnel property.\n", "  Transistors incorporating single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the channel\nmaterial are used in a variety of electronics applications. However, a\ncompetitive CNT-based technology requires the precise placement of CNTs at\npredefined locations of a substrate. One promising placement approach is to use\nchemical recognition to bind CNTs from solution at the desired locations on a\nsurface. Producing the chemical pattern on the substrate is challenging. Here\nwe describe a one-step patterning approach based on a highly photosensitive\nsurface monolayer. The monolayer contains chromophopric group as light\nsensitive body with heteroatoms as high quantum yield photolysis center. As\ndeposited, the layer will bind CNTs from solution. However, when exposed to\nultraviolet (UV) light with a low dose (60 mJ/cm2) similar to that used for\nconventional photoresists, the monolayer cleaves and no longer binds CNTs.\nThese features allow standard, wafer-scale UV lithography processes to be used\nto form a patterned chemical monolayer without the need for complex substrate\npatterning or monolayer stamping.\n", "  We investigate the collective excitations of a Raman-induced spin-orbit\ncoupled Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasi one-dimension harmonic\ntrap using the Bogoliubov method. By tuning the Raman coupling strength, three\nphases of the system can be identified. By calculating the transition strength,\nwe are able to classify various excitation modes that are experimentally\nrelevant. We show that the three quantum phases possess distinct features in\ntheir collective excitation properties. In particular, the spin dipole and the\nspin breathing modes can be used to clearly map out the phase boundaries. We\nconfirm these predictions by direct numerical simulations of the quench\ndynamics that excites the relevant collective modes.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations were used to explain the origin and properties\nof electrical double-layer capacitance in short graphene nanochannels with\nwidth below 2 nm. The results explain the previously reported experimental\nresult on the non-monotonic dependence of the capacitance with the channel\nwidth. The mechanism for the anomalous increase of the capacitance in sub-1-nm\nin pore diameter is attributed here to the width-dependent radial location of\ncounterions in the nanochannels, and the restricted number of co-ions. Decrease\nof the channel width lowers the number of co-ions and positions the counterions\ncloser to the channel walls. For nanochannels with width ranging from 1 to 2\nnm, co-ions are allowed to enter the nanochannel, and both types of ions assume\nalternating layered distributions leading to the decrease of the capacitance.\nVoltage is another control parameter which allows understanding capacitance in\ngraphene nanochannels. As the voltage increases, due to limited space near the\ncharged surface, more counterions need to be located in the center of the\nnanochannel resulting in further capacitance decrease.\n", "  Through molecular dynamics simulations considering thermal vibration of\nsurface atoms, ionic behaviors in concentrated NaCl solutions confined between\ndiscretely charged silicon surfaces have been investigated. The electric double\nlayer structure was found sensitive to the density and distribution of surface\ncharges. Due to the surface charge discreteness, slight charge inversion\nappeared which depended on the surface charge density, bulk concentration and\nconfinement. In the nanoconfined NaCl solutions differently concentrated from\n0.2 M to 4.0 M, the locations of accumulation layers for Na+ and Cl- ions kept\nstable, but their peak values increased. The higher the concentration was, the\nmore obvious charge inversion appeared. In 4.0 M NaCl solution, Na+ and Cl-\nions show obvious alternating layered distributions which may be corresponding\nto the solidification found in experiments. By changing surface separation, the\nconfinement had a large effect on ionic distributions. As both surfaces\napproached each other, many ions and water molecules were squeezed out of the\nconfined space. Two adjacent layers in ion or water distribution profiles can\nbe forced to closer to each other and merge together. From ionic hydration\nanalysis, the coordination number of Na+ ions in highly-confined space was much\nlower than that in the bulk.\n", "  Quite recently, enhancing security against device-attack vulnerability has\nbeen theoretically challenging but also practically important in quantum\ncryptographic communication. For dealing with this issue in a general and\nstrict scenario, we design a seemingly-new kind of quantum secure direct\ncommunication (QSDC) in a linear-optical regime, which we call\n\"preparation-attack-immune QSDC.\" We address that in our \"naive\" analysis, it\nis quite formidable to extract even a piece of information of the secret\nmessage, and any malicious eavesdropping attempts will be unsuccessful. The\nmost remarkable feature is that even in the case where a powerful eavesdropper\ncan peep at all preparation device settings, our protocol still keeps a high\nlevel of security without invoking any additional resources and physical\nproperties. This novel advantage that we call \"preparation-attack immunity\"\ncomes from the simultaneous use of the two degrees of freedom involved in a\nsingle-photon (polarization and spatial modes), which enables one to faithfully\ndeal with the single-photon quantum superposition nature. Our idea can be\ngeneralized to other single-photon based protocols.\n", "  A previously unreported Pb-based perovskite PbMoO$_3$ is obtained by\nhigh-pressure and high-temperature synthesis. This material crystallizes in the\n$Pm\\bar{3}m$ cubic structure at room temperature, making it distinct from\ntypical Pb-based perovskite oxides with a structural distortion. PbMoO$_3$\nexhibits a metallic behavior down to 0.1 K with an unusual $T$-sub linear\ndependence of the electrical resistivity. Moreover, a large specific heat is\nobserved at low temperatures accompanied by a peak in $C_P/T^3$ around 10 K, in\nmarked contrast to the isostructural metallic system SrMoO$_3$. These transport\nand thermal properties for PbMoO$_3$, taking into account anomalously large Pb\natomic displacements detected through diffraction experiments, are attributed\nto a low-energy vibrational mode, associated with incoherent off-centering of\nlone pair Pb$^{2+}$ cations. We discuss the unusual behavior of the electrical\nresistivity in terms of a polaron-like conduction, mediated by the strong\ncoupling between conduction electrons and optical phonons of the local\nlow-energy vibrational mode.\n", "  We present nonlocal integrable reductions of super AKNS coupled equations. By\nthe use of nonlocal reductions of Ablowitz and Musslimani we find new super\nintegrable equations. In particular we introduce nonlocal super NLS equations\nand the nonlocal super mKdV equations.\n", "  Multicore fibers are gaining growing attention in astronomy. The two main\nattributes which make them attractive for astronomy are that they reduce the\ndistance between cores and hence have a superior fill factor to other\napproaches and they offer the possibility to transport light in many channels\nwith the overhead of only having to handle a single fiber. These properties are\nbeing exploited to realize miniature integral field units that can transport\nlight from different regions in a focal plane to a spectrograph for example.\nHere we offer an overview of several applications where multicore fibers are\nnow being considered and applied to astronomical observations to enhance\nscientific yield.\n", "  Quantum sensing is commonly described as a constrained optimization problem:\nmaximize the information gained about an unknown quantity using a limited\nnumber of particles. Important sensors including gravitational-wave\ninterferometers and some atomic sensors do not appear to fit this description,\nbecause there is no external constraint on particle number. Here we develop the\ntheory of particle-number-unconstrained quantum sensing, and describe how\noptimal particle numbers emerge from the competition of particle-environment\nand particle-particle interactions. We apply the theory to optical probing of\nan atomic medium modeled as a resonant, saturable absorber, and observe the\nemergence of well-defined finite optima without external constraints. The\nresults contradict some expectations from number-constrained quantum sensing,\nand show that probing with squeezed beams can give a large sensitivity\nadvantage over classical strategies, when each is optimized for particle\nnumber.\n", "  This contribution reports an application of MultiFractal Detrended\nFluctuation Analysis, MFDFA based novel feature extraction technique for\nautomated detection of epilepsy. In fractal geometry, Multifractal Detrended\nFluctuation Analysis MFDFA is a popular technique to examine the\nself-similarity of a nonlinear, chaotic and noisy time series. In the present\nresearch work, EEG signals representing healthy, interictal (seizure free) and\nictal activities (seizure) are acquired from an existing available database.\nThe acquired EEG signals of different states are at first analyzed using MFDFA.\nTo requisite the time series singularity quantification at local and global\nscales, a novel set of fourteen different features. Suitable feature ranking\nemploying students t-test has been done to select the most statistically\nsignificant features which are henceforth being used as inputs to a support\nvector machines (SVM) classifier for the classification of different EEG\nsignals. Eight different classification problems have been presented in this\npaper and it has been observed that the overall classification accuracy using\nMFDFA based features are reasonably satisfactory for all classification\nproblems. The performance of the proposed method are also found to be quite\ncommensurable and in some cases even better when compared with the results\npublished in existing literature studied on the similar data set.\n", "  Velleytronics as a new electronic conception is an emerging exciting research\nfield with wide potential applications, which is attracting great research\ninterests for their extraordinary properties. The localized electronic spins by\noptical generation of valley polarization with spin-like quantum numbers are\npromising candidates for implementing quantum-information processing in solids.\nIt is expected that a single qubit preparation can be realized optically by\nusing combination of left- and right-circularly polarized lights. Significantly\nin a series of experiments, this has already been well achieved by linearly\npolarized laser representing equal weights of left- and right-circular\ncomponents resulting in formation of a valley exciton as a specific pseudo-spin\nqubit with equal amplitudes for spin up and spin down. Further researches on\nthe control of valley pseudospin using longitudinal magnetic field and optical\nStark effect have been reported. However, a general qubit preparation has not\nyet been demonstrated. Moreover as a platform for quantum information\nprocessing, the precise readout of a qubit state is necessary, for which the\nstate tomography is a standard method in obtaining all information of a qubit\nstate density matrix.\n", "  The thermodynamic properties of dipolar spin ice on square, honeycomb and\nshakti lattices in the long-range and short-range dipole interaction models are\nstudied. Exact solutions for the density of states, temperature dependencies of\nheat capacity, and entropy are obtained for these lattices with a finite number\nof point dipoles by means of complete enumeration. The magnetic susceptibility\nand average size of the largest low-energy cluster are calculated for square\nspin ice by means of Wang-Landau and Metropolis methods. We show that the\nlong-range interaction leads to a blurring of the energy spectrum for all\nconsidered lattices. The inclusion of the long-range interaction leads to a\nsignificant change in the thermodynamic behaviour. An additional peak of heat\ncapacity appears in the case of the honeycomb lattice. The critical temperature\nshifts in the direction of low or high temperatures; the direction depends on\nthe lattice geometry. The critical temperature of the phase transition of\nsquare spin ice in the long-range model with frustrated ground states is\nobtained with the Wang-Landau and Metropolis methods independently.\n", "  North-south (N-S) asymmetry of solar activity is a known statistical\nphenomenon but its significance is difficult to prove or theoretically explain.\nHere we consider each solar hemisphere as a separate dynamical system connected\nwith the other hemisphere via an unknown coupling parameter. We use a\nnon-linear dynamics approach to calculate the scale-dependent conditional\ndispersion (CD) of sunspots between hemispheres. Using daily Greenwich sunspot\nareas, we calculated the Neumann and Pearson chi-squared distances between CDs\nas indices showing the direction of coupling. We introduce an additional index\nof synchronization which shows the strength of coupling and allows us to\ndiscriminate between complete synchronization and independency of hemispheres.\nAll indices are evaluated in a four-year moving window showing the evolution of\ncoupling between hemispheres. We find that the driver-response interrelation\nchanges between hemispheres have a few pulses during 130 years of Greenwich\ndata with an at least 40 years-long period of unidirectional coupling. These\nsharp nearly simultaneous pulses of all causality indices are found at the\ndecay of some 11-year cycles. The pulse rate of this new phenomenon of dynamic\ncoupling is irregular: although the first two pulses repeat after 22-year Hale\ncycles, the last two pulses repeat after three and four 11-year cycles\nrespectively. The last pulse occurs at the decay phase of Cycle 23 so the next\npulse will likely appear during the decay of future Cycle 25 or later. This new\nphenomenon of dynamic coupling reveals additional constraints for understanding\nand modeling of the long-term solar activity cycles.\n", "  In recent years, fundamental relationships for the black hole X-ray binaries\nhave been established between their X-ray luminosity $L_X$ and the photon index\n$\\Gamma$ of their X-ray spectrum. For the moderate-luminosity regime, an\nanti-correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $L_X$ has been observed. In this article,\naimed to verify if the moderate luminous X-ray binary system LSI +61303 is a\nblack hole, we analyse $Swift$ observations of LSI +61303. We compare the\nderived $L_X$ vs $\\Gamma$ distribution, first with the statistical trend for\nblack hole X-ray binaries, then with the trend of the pulsar PSR B1259-63, and\nfinally with the individual trends of the black hole X-ray binaries Swift\nJ1357.2-0933 and V404 Cygni. We find that the system PSR B1259-63 shows a\npositive correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $L_X$, whereas in contrast LSI +61303\nshows the same anti-correlation as for black hole X-ray binaries. Moreover, the\ntrend of LSI +61303 in the $L_X$/$L_{Eddington} - \\Gamma$ plane overlaps with\nthat of the two black holes Swift J1357.2-0933 and V404 Cygni. All three\nsystems, Swift J1357.2-0933, V404 Cygni and LSI +61303 well trace the last part\nof the evolution of accreting black holes at moderate-luminosity until their\ndrop to quiescence.\n", "  The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has been shown to stabilise\nNe\\'{e}l domain walls in magnetic thin films, allowing high domain wall\nvelocities driven by spin current effects. DMI occurs at the interface between\nferromagnetic and heavy metal layers with strong spin-orbit coupling, but\ndetails of the interaction remain to be understood and the role of proximity\ninduced magnetism (PIM) in the heavy metal is unknown. We report interfacial\nDMI and PIM in Pt determined as a function of Au and Ir spacer layers in\nPt/Co/Au,Ir/Pt. The length-scale for both interactions is sensitive to\nsub-nanometre changes in the spacer thickness, and they correlate over sub\nmono-layer spacer thicknesses, but not for thicker spacers. The spacer layer\nthickness dependence of the Pt PIM for both Au and Ir shows a rapid monotonic\ndecay, while the DMI changes rapidly but has a two-step approach to saturation\nand continues to change, even after the PIM is lost.\n", "  A theoretical study of the DOS, resistivity and thermal conductivity of a\nmetallized epitaxial graphene with impurities and structural inhomogeneous of\nthe short-range order type is performed. The conditions for the appearance and\ndisappearance of a gap in DOS are obtained for the case where the location of\ndefects changes. A temperature dependence of relaxation time, DOS, resistivity\nand thermal conductivity is described only in the presence of the structures\nforming large-area cells in the graphene layer.\n", "  The relationship between the spectral density and free energy of a spin\nsystem is considered. The analytical expressions allowing for the calculation\nof the spectral density for solvable models are determined. A linear Ising\nmodel is taken for testing the approach. Additionally, the approach is used to\nanalyze the spectral density of a 2D Ising model, a Bethe-lattice model and a\nmean-field model. Even a small change of the spectral density is shown to be\nable to radically change the parameters of the system.\n", "  We study the shuttling of an atom in a trap with controllable position and\nfrequency. Using invariant-based inverse engineering, protocols in which the\ntrap is simultaneously displaced and expanded are proposed to speed up\ntransport between stationary trap locations as well as launching processes with\nnarrow final-velocity distributions. Depending on the physical constraints\nimposed, either simultaneous or sequential approaches may be faster. We\nconsider first a perfectly harmonic trap, and then extend the treatment to\ngeneric traps. Finally, we apply this general framework to a double-well\npotential to separate different motional states with different launching\nvelocities.\n", "  The analytic THO method is generalized to study three-body nuclei of\nastrophysical interest, and applied to $^6$He. Results are consistent with\nprevious publications and experimental data.\n", "  In recent years, a large body of research has demonstrated that judgments and\nbehaviors can propagate from person to person. Phenomena as diverse as\npolitical mobilization, health practices, altruism, and emotional states\nexhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The precise mechanisms of\njudgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult\nto control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network\nstructures. We introduce a novel experimental design that renders possible the\nstringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of\nindividuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after\nobserving a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at\nthe top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment\npropagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation\nexperimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals,\nthe reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social\ndistance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer\nsimulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially\nwith the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion\nand the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level\nmechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our\nresults contribute to the understanding of social contagion processes, and our\nexperimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment\npropagation in the laboratory.\n", "  The scattering of $^9$Be on $^{208}$Pb is addressed within a four-body\nContinuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) framework, considering a\nthree-body $\\alpha + \\alpha + n$ projectile plus a structureless target. The\nprojectile states are generated using the analytical Transformed Harmonic\nOscillator (THO) basis in hyperspherical coordinates. Both the elastic and\nbreakup channels are described on the same footing. We find a good agreement\nbetween our calculations and the experimental data at beam energies around and\nbelow the Coulomb barrier.\n", "  Atomic Force Microscopy - Infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy allows spectroscopic\nstudies in the mid-infrared spectral region with a spatial resolution better\nthan 50 nm. We show that the high spatial resolution can be used to perform\nspectroscopic and imaging studies at the subcellular level in fixed eukaryotic\ncells. We collect AFM-IR images of subcellular structures that include lipid\ndroplets, vesicles and cytoskeletal filaments, by relying on the intrinsic\ncontrast from IR light absorption. We also obtain AFM-IR absorption spectra of\nindividual structures. Most spectra show features that are recognizable in the\nIR absorption spectra of cells and tissue obtained with FTIR technology,\nincluding absorption bands characteristic of phospholipids and polypeptides. We\nalso observe sharp spectral features that we attribute to the nonlinear\nphotothermal response of the system and we propose that they can be used to\nperform sensitive spectroscopy on the nanoscale.\n", "  For applications to quasi-exactly solvable Schr\\\"odinger equations in quantum\nmechanics, we establish the general conditions that have to be satisfied by the\ncoefficients of a second-order differential equation with at most $k+1$\nsingular points in order that this equation has particular solutions which are\n$n$th-degree polynomials. In a first approach, we extend the Nikiforov-Uvarov\nmethod, which was devised to deal with hypergeometric-type equations (i.e., for\n$k=2$), and show that the conditions involve $k-2$ integration constants. In a\nsecond approach, we consider the functional Bethe ansatz method in its most\ngeneral form. Comparing the two approaches, we prove that under the assumption\nthat the roots of the polynomial solutions are real and distinct, the $k-2$\nintegration constants of the extended Nikiforov-Uvarov method can be expressed\nas linear combinations of monomial symmetric polynomials in those roots,\ncorresponding to partitions into no more than two parts.\n", "  Investigation of the critical levels and catastrophes in the complex systems\nof different nature is useful and perspective. Mathematical modeling and\nanalysis is presented for revealing and investigation of the phenomena and\ncritical levels in a development of complex systems for various natures\nassociated with diverse complicated factors, in particular with shifted\narguments of the system. Intensive research in this direction and developed\ntechniques may optimize management of the complex systems in\nfinancial-economic, natural and other fields. Construction of adequate\nmathematical models for development of complex systems, critical modes and\ntheir effective control are important tasks for a wide range of contemporary\nissues as shown in paper on examples. Critical levels in development of\neconomic, banking, technical, political and other systems are necessary to\ndetermine and anticipate, to manage their system requirements and provide\nstable development, without being hit in a critical situations, leading to\ngrowing oscillations of the system settings.\n", "  Short fiber reinforced polymer composites have found extensive industrial and\nengineering applications owing to their unique combination of low cost,\nrelatively easy processing and superior mechanical properties compared to their\nparent polymers. In this study, a coarse grained (CG) model of cross linked\ncarbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced polymer matrix composites is developed. A\ncharacteristic feature of the CG model is the ability to capture the\ninteractions between polymer chains, and nanotubes and polymer matrix. The\ndependence of the elastic properties of the composites on the mole fraction of\ncross links, and the weight fraction and distribution of nano tube\nreinforcements is discussed. The simulation results reveal that the\nfictionalization of CNTs using methylene cross links is a key factor toward\nsignicantly increasing the elastic properties of randomly distributed short CNT\nreinforced poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The applicability of the\nCG model in predicting the elastic properties of CNT reinforced polymer\ncomposites is also evaluated through a verification process with a\nmicromechanical model for unidirectional short fibers.\n", "  While parallel microchannel based cooling systems have been around for quite\na period of time, employing the same and incorporating them for near active\ncooling of microelectronic devices is yet to be implemented and the\nimplications of the same on thermal mitigation to be understood. The present\narticle focusses on a specific design of the PMCS such that it can be\nimplemented at ease on the heat spreader of a modern microprocessor to obtain\nnear active cooling. Extensive experimental and numerical studies have been\ncarried out to comprehend the same and three different flow configurations of\nPMCS have been adopted for the present investigations. Additional to focussing\non the thermofluidics due to flow configuration, nanofluids have also been\nemployed to achieve the desired essentials of mitigation of overshoot\ntemperatures and improving uniformity of cooling. Two modelling methods,\nDiscrete Phase Modelling and Effective Property Modelling have been employed\nfor numerical study to model nanofluids as working fluid in micro flow paths\nand the DPM predictions have been observed to match accurately with\nexperiments. To quantify the thermal performance of PMCS, an appropriate Figure\nof Merit has been proposed. From the FoM It has been perceived that the Z\nconfiguration employing nanofluid is the best suitable solutions for uniform\nthermal loads to achieve uniform cooling as well as reducing maximum\ntemperature produced with in the device. The present results are very promising\nand viable approach for futuristic thermal mitigation of microprocessor\nsystems.\n", "  A long controversy of ice lensing exists in the research of frost heave. By\nelucidating the mechanical and thermodynamics equilibria at the interface, we\npresent the thermodynamics of the water/ice interface from macroscale to\nmicroscale for the freezing of colloidal suspensions. The application of the\nClapeyron equation is confirmed both at macroscale to microscale via curvature\neffect. The thermodynamics at the interface indicates the initial of ice\nlensing/banding from the growth of pore ice, determined by the critical\ncurvature undercooling instead of the critical fracture of frozen fringe. It is\nalso proposed that the packing status of the porous structure in the particle\nlayer ahead of the water/ice interface determines the ice lensing behaviors.\nThe results presented here are different scenarios from previous investigations\nof freezing colloidal suspensions, and may shed light on the researches of this\narea.\n", "  In this paper the dependence of the best constants in Sobolev and\nGagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities on the precise form of the Sobolev space norm\nis investigated. The analysis is carried out on general graded Lie groups, thus\nincluding the cases of $\\mathbb R^n$, Heisenberg, and more general stratified\nLie groups. The Sobolev norms may be defined in terms of Rockland operators,\ni.e. the hypoelliptic homogeneous left-invariant differential operators on the\ngroup. The best constants are expressed in the variational form as well as in\nterms of the ground state solutions of the corresponding nonlinear subelliptic\nequations. The orders of these equations can be high depending on the Sobolev\nspace order in the Sobolev or Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, or may be\nfractional. Applications are obtained also to equations with lower order terms\ngiven by different hypoelliptic operators. Already in the case of $\\mathbb\nR^n$, the obtained results extend the classical relations by Weinstein to a\nwide range of nonlinear elliptic equations of high orders with elliptic low\norder terms and a wide range of interpolation inequalities of\nGagliardo-Nirenberg type. However, the proofs are different from those ivy\nWeinstein because of the impossibility of using the rearrangement inequalities\nalready in the setting of the Heisenberg group. The considered class of graded\ngroups is the most general class of nilpotent Lie groups where one can still\nconsider hypoelliptic homogeneous invariant differential operators and the\ncorresponding subelliptic differential equations.\n", "  We apply Dicke's theory of superradiance introduced in 1954 to the methanol\n6.7 GHz and water 22 GHz spectral lines, often detected in molecular clouds as\nsignposts for the early stages of the star formation process. We suggest that\nsuperradiance, characterized by burst-like features taking place over a wide\nrange of time-scales, may provide a natural explanation for the recent\nobservations of periodic and seemingly alternating methanol and water maser\nflares in G107.298+5.639. Although these observations would be very difficult\nto explain within the context of maser theory, we show that these flares may\nresult from simultaneously initiated 6.7-GHz methanol and 22-GHz water\nsuperradiant bursts operating on different time-scales, thus providing a\nnatural mechanism for their observed durations and time ordering. The evidence\nof superradiance in this source further suggests the existence of entangled\nquantum mechanical states, involving a very large number of molecules, over\ndistances up to a few kilometres in the interstellar medium.\n", "  Silicon-vacancy color centers in nanodiamonds are promising as fluorescent\nlabels for biological applications, with a narrow, non-bleaching emission line\nat 738\\,nm. Two-photon excitation of this fluorescence offers the possibility\nof low-background detection at significant tissue depth with high\nthree-dimensional spatial resolution. We have measured the two-photon\nfluorescence cross section of a negatively-charged silicon vacancy (SiV$^-$) in\nion-implanted bulk diamond to be $0.74(19) \\times 10^{-50}{\\rm cm^4\\;s/photon}$\nat an excitation wavelength of 1040\\,nm. In comparison to the diamond nitrogen\nvacancy (NV) center, the expected detection threshold of a two-photon excited\nSiV center is more than an order of magnitude lower, largely due to its much\nnarrower linewidth. We also present measurements of two- and three-photon\nexcitation spectra, finding an increase in the two-photon cross section with\ndecreasing wavelength, and discuss the physical interpretation of the spectra\nin the context of existing models of the SiV energy-level structure.\n", "  We present the VST Optical Imaging of the CDFS and ES1 Fields (VOICE) Survey,\na VST INAF Guaranteed Time program designed to provide optical coverage of two\n4 deg$^2$ cosmic windows in the Southern hemisphere. VOICE provides the first,\nmulti-band deep optical imaging of these sky regions, thus complementing and\nenhancing the rich legacy of longer-wavelength surveys with VISTA, Spitzer,\nHerschel and ATCA available in these areas and paving the way for upcoming\nobservations with facilities such as the LSST, MeerKAT and the SKA. VOICE\nexploits VST's OmegaCAM optical imaging capabilities and completes the\nreduction of WFI data available within the ES1 fields as part of the\nESO-Spitzer Imaging Extragalactic Survey (ESIS) program providing $ugri$ and\n$uBVR$ coverage of 4 and 4 deg$^2$ areas within the CDFS and ES1 field\nrespectively. We present the survey's science rationale and observing strategy,\nthe data reduction and multi-wavelength data fusion pipeline. Survey data\nproducts and their future updates will be released at\nhttp://www.mattiavaccari.net/voice/ and on CDS/VizieR.\n", "  All-electrical control of a dynamic magnetoelectric effect is demonstrated in\na classical multiferroic manganite DyMnO3, a material containing coupled\nantiferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders. Due to intrinsic magnetoelectric\ncoupling with electromagnons a linearly polarized terahertz light rotates upon\npassing through the sample. The amplitude and the direction of the polarization\nrotation are defined by the orientation of ferroelectric domains and can be\nswitched by static voltage. These experiments allow the terahertz polarization\nto be tuned using the dynamic magnetoelectric effect.\n", "  The peculiarities of defect modes and reflection spectra of chiral photonic\ncrystals (CPC) with an isotropic defect for various thicknesses of the defect\nlayer was investigated. The peculiarities of the spectra of photonic density of\nthe state (DOS) and those of the intensity at the center of the defect were\ninvestigated, too. It was shown that there is one more possibility of tuning of\nlaser emission - by the change of the defect layer thickness - in CPCs doped\nwith laser dyes (with resonance atoms) and with an isotropic defect. It was\nshown that the given system can work as a tunable narrow-band filter (or\nmirror) with tunable wavelength width and tunable location of frequency of the\ncomplete transmittance (reflection) band. The radiation peculiarities of these\nsystems were discussed. It was shown that in certain conditions an anomalous\nstrong radiation can be observed for defect modes, and low - threshold laser\ngeneration is possible, again, for these modes. It was also shown that\nradiation suppression is possible for defect modes. The peculiarities of group\nvelocity, group velocity dispersion and nonreciprocity were studied.\n", "  The fundamental limits of atomic fountains as operational clocks are\nconsidered. Four rubidium fountains in operation at the U.S. Naval Observatory\nfor over 5.5 years have demonstrated unprecedented long-term stability for\ncontinuously running clocks [1,2]. With only these rubidium fountains, a\npost-processed timescale can be created that demonstrates superior long-term\nperformance to any individual clock by compensating for occasional frequency\nsteps. By comparing to the world's primary standards we demonstrate instability\nof this rubidium fountain timescale reaching the mid $10^{-17}$'s and zero\ndrift at the level of $1.3 \\times 10^{-19}$/day. We discuss fundamental limits\ndue to common mode behaviour or individual fountain performance that cannot be\ncorrected.\n", "  We study minimal harmonic maps $g: {\\mathbb{C}} \\to SO(3) \\backslash\nSL(3,{\\mathbb{R}})$, parameterized by polynomial cubic differentials $P$ in the\nplane. The asymptotic structure of such a $g$ is determined by a convex polygon\n$Y(P)$ in ${\\mathbb{RP}^2}$. We give a conjectural method for determining\n$Y(P)$ by solving a fixed-point problem for a certain integral operator. The\ntechnology of spectral networks and BPS state counts is a key input to the\nformulation of this fixed-point problem. We work out two families of examples\nin detail.\n", "  To obtain precisely controllable, robust as well as reproduceable memristor\nfor efficient neuromorphic computing still very challenging. Molecular\ntailoring aims at obtaining the much more flexibly tuning plasticity has\nrecently generated significant interest as new paradigms toward the realization\nof novel memristor-based synapses. Herein, inspired by the deliberate oxygen\ntransport carried by the hemoglobin in our blood circulation, we report a novel\nmolecular-regulated electronic/ionic semiconducting (MEIS) platform\nITO/MTPP/Al2O3-x/Al with a series of metallophorphyrins (MTPPs) to delicately\nregulate the ionic migration for robust molecular multimedia memristors. The\nstable pinched hysteresis resulted from the coordination-regulated ionic\nmigration was verified by different device structures, operation modes, as well\nas the characterizations of scanning transmission electron microscopy with\nenergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) and X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS). Metal coordination-dependent device parameters such as\npotential and depression as well as retention curves further support the\ncorrelation between the coordination and stimulating flux-dependent memristive\nbehaviors. In the 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphyrin zinc(II) (ZnTPP)\nsynapse, we implement versatile emulations, mainly including transition from\nshort-term memory (STM) to long-term-memory (LTM), learning experience and\nactivity-dependent learning-memory process in integrated neuromorphic\nconfigurations based on the biological Hebbian rules, and develop the fresh\nSpike-Amplitude-Dependent-Plasticity (SADP) with the applications of signal\nfiltering and habituation and sensitization which are beyond the prevalent\nHebbian rules.\n", "  The quest for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) is a\npromising experimental approach to search for lepton number violation in weak\ninteractions, a key ingredient in generating the matter-antimatter asymmetry\nthrough models of Leptogenesis. The $^{136}$Xe-based $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\nexperiments KamLAND-Zen and EXO-200 currently set the most stringent limits on\nthis process using two very different techniques. Each are preparing the next\ngeneration experiment, which will search for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ in the parameter\nspace corresponding to the inverted hierarchy for neutrino mass. Both of these\ntechniques scale well to larger volumes while incorporating interesting new\ntechniques. We present the status of current and next generation experiments of\nthese collaborations and present two developments with the potential to\nidentify $\\beta\\beta$ decay events.\n", "  We use 16 quarters of the \\textit{Kepler} mission data to analyze the transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) of the extrasolar planet Kepler-46b (KOI-872). Our\ndynamical fits confirm that the TTVs of this planet (period\n$P=33.648^{+0.004}_{-0.005}$ days) are produced by a non-transiting planet\nKepler-46c ($P=57.325^{+0.116}_{-0.098}$ days). The Bayesian inference tool\n\\texttt{MultiNest} is used to infer the dynamical parameters of Kepler-46b and\nKepler-46c. We find that the two planets have nearly coplanar and circular\norbits, with eccentricities $\\simeq 0.03$ somewhat higher than previously\nestimated. The masses of the two planets are found to be\n$M_{b}=0.885^{+0.374}_{-0.343}$ and $M_{c}=0.362^{+0.016}_{-0.016}$ Jupiter\nmasses, with $M_{b}$ being determined here from TTVs for the first time. Due to\nthe precession of its orbital plane, Kepler-46c should start transiting its\nhost star in a few decades from now.\n", "  Exact propagator of density matrix of particle (electron) under influence of\nthermal vibrations of its medium (phonons) is treated in simplest approximation\nbeyond the Fermi's golden rule. It is shown that uncertainties \\,$\\sim\\h/t$\\,\nin energy exchanges with the medium give rise to flicker fluctuations in rate\nof diffusion (diffusivity) of the particle\n", "  Nitrogenated holey graphene (NHG), a two-dimensional graphene-derived\nmaterial with a C2N stoichiometry and evenly distributed holes and nitrogen\natoms in its basal plane, has recently been synthesized. We performed first\nprinciples calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate\nmechanical and heat transport properties of this novel two-dimensional material\nat various temperatures. First principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory yield an elastic modulus of 400 +/- 5 GPa at 0 K, 10% larger\nthan predicted by molecular dynamics simulations at low temperatures. We\nobserved an overall decreasing trend in elastic modulus and tensile strength as\ntemperature increases. At room temperature, we found that NHG can present a\nremarkable elastic modulus of 335 +/- 5 GPa and tensile strength of 60 GPa. We\nalso investigated the thermal conductivity of NHG via non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics simulations. At 300 K an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 64.8 W/m-K\nwas found, with an effective phonon mean free path of 34.0 nm, both of which\nare smaller than respective values for graphene, and decrease with temperature.\nOur modeling-based predictions should serve as guide to experiments concerning\nphysical properties of this novel material.\n", "  Recent years have heralded the introduction of metasurfaces that\nadvantageously combine the vision of sub- wavelength wave manipulation, with\nthe design, fabrication and size advantages associated with surface excitation.\nAn important topic within metasurfaces is the tailored rainbow trapping and\nselective spatial frequency separation of electromagnetic and acoustic waves\nusing graded metasurfaces. This frequency dependent trapping and spatial\nfrequency segregation has implications for energy concentrators and associated\nenergy harvesting, sensing and wave filtering techniques. Different\ndemonstrations of acoustic and electromagnetic rainbow devices have been\nperformed, however not for deep elastic substrates that support both shear and\ncompressional waves, together with surface Rayleigh waves; these allow not only\nfor Rayleigh wave rainbow effects to exist but also for mode conversion from\nsurface into bulk waves. We design, and test experimentally, a device creating\nnot only elastic Rayleigh wave rainbow trapping, but also selective mode\nconversion of surface Rayleigh waves to shear waves.\n", "  We demonstrate the influence of hard axis assist on an in-plane polarized\nnanomagnet layer to greatly enhance the sensitivity of a magnetic nano particle\n(MNP) based MTJ biosensor. The hard axis assist has been provided to the\nsensing layer in the forms of spin Hall Effect (SHE) induced spin injected\ntorque and stress based effective magnetic field induced torque separately.\nPresent work mainly focuses on the efficient and qualitative detection of a\nsingle magnetic bead with the aim of detecting a single bimolecular recognition\nevent at an extremely low analyte concentration. Interfacial spin current\narising from spin orbit metal is expected to impose a torque on the free layer\nalong sensitive direction improving the signal strength by a factor of ~ 6.5\nfor a 100 nm bead at a height of 500 nm above the sensor surface. Furthermore,\nthe potentiality of a multiferroic composite consisting of a piezoelectric\nlayer coupled with magnetostrictive CoFeB based MTJ has been investigated in\nthe Biosensing applications. An external stress voltage of 500 mV has been\nobserved to be sufficient to enhance the sensitivity (~ 6 times). The use of\nnanoscaled spin devices and the absence of external magnetic field operated\nmagnetization rotation facilitates in achieving highly compact and extremely\nlow power designs. This establishes the possibility of utilizing the present\nschemes for advanced, highly sensitive, miniaturized and low power bioassaying\nsystem-on-chip applications. Numerical results were compared with some earlier\nreported experimental results to validate our proposed model.\n", "  To advance knowledge of K bonding in Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS) photovoltaic\n(PV) absorbers, recent Cu-K-In-Se phase growth studies have been extended to PV\nperformance. First, the effect of distributing K throughout bulk Cu1-xKxInSe2\nabsorbers at low K/(K+Cu) compositions (0 <= x <= 0.30) was studied.\nEfficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) were greatly\nenhanced for x ~ 0.07, resulting in an officially-measured 15.0%-efficient\nsolar cell, matching to the world record CuInSe2 efficiency. The improvements\nwere a result of reduced interface and bulk recombination, relative to CuInSe2\n(x ~ 0). However, higher x compositions had reduced efficiency, short-circuit\ncurrent density (JSC), and FF due to greatly increased interface recombination,\nrelative to the x ~ 0 baseline. Next, the effect of confining K at the\nabsorber/buffer interface at high K/(K+Cu) compositions (0.30 <= x <= 0.92) was\nresearched. Previous work showed that these surface layer growth conditions\nproduced CuInSe2 with a large phase fraction of KInSe2. After optimization (75\nnm surface layer with x ~ 0.41), these KInSe2 surface samples exhibited\nincreased efficiency (officially 14.9%), VOC, and FF as a result of decreased\ninterface recombination. The KInSe2 surfaces had features similar to previous\nreports for KF post-deposition treatments (PDTs) used in world record CIGS\nsolar cells-taken as indirect evidence that KInSe2 can form during these PDTs.\nBoth the bulk and surface growth processes greatly reduced interface\nrecombination. However, the KInSe2 surface had higher K levels near the\nsurface, greater lifetimes, and increased inversion near the buffer interface,\nrelative to the champion bulk CKIS absorber. These characteristics demonstrate\nthat K may benefit PV performance by different mechanisms at the surface and in\nthe absorber bulk.\n", "  A theoretical approach to photoconversion efficiency modeling in perovskite\np-i-n structures is developed. The results of this modeling compare favorably\nwith the experiment and indicate that the surfaces of the perovskite solar\ncells (SCs) are naturally textured. It is shown that photoconversion efficiency\nin the limiting case of negligible Shockley-Read-Hall and surface recombination\nand in the absence of optical losses reaches the value of 29%. In the realistic\ncase, the current-voltage curve ideality factor equals 2. This value is not due\nto recombination in the space-charge region; rather, it can be explained by\ntaking into account the effect of the rear surface and high excitation level.\n", "  Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures are receiving great attentions due to\ntheir intriguing properties and potentials in many research fields. The flow of\ncharge carriers in vdW heterostructures can be efficiently rectified by the\ninter-layer coupling between neighboring layers, offering a rich collection of\nfunctionalities and a mechanism for designing atomically thin devices.\nNevertheless, non-uniform contact in larger-area heterostructures reduces the\ndevice efficiency. In this work, ion irradiation had been verified as an\nefficient technique to enhance the contact and interlayer coupling in the newly\ndeveloped graphene/WSe2 hetero-structure with a large area of 10 mm x 10 mm.\nDuring the ion irradiation process, the morphology of monolayer graphene had\nbeen modified, promoting the contact with WSe2. Experimental evidences of the\ntunable interlayer electron transfer are displayed by investigation of\nphotoluminescence and ultrafast absorption of the irradiated heterostructure.\nBesides, we have found that in graphene/WSe2 heterostructure, graphene serves\nas a fast channel for the photo-excited carriers to relax in WSe2, and the\nnonlinear absorption of WSe2 could be effectively tuned by the carrier transfer\nprocess in graphene, enabling specific optical absorption of the\nheterostructure in comparison with separated graphene or WSe2. On the basis of\nthese new findings, by applying the ion beam modified graphene/WSe2\nheterostructure as a saturable absorber, Q-switched pulsed lasing with\noptimized performance has been realized in a Nd:YAG waveguide cavity. This work\npaves the way towards developing novel devices based on large-area\nheterostructures by using ion beam irradiation.\n", "  In the experimental electroluminescence (EL) spectra of light-emitting diodes\n(LEDs) based on N-polar (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowires (NWs), we observed a double peak\nstructure. The relative intensity of the two peaks evolves in a peculiar way\nwith injected current. Spatially and spectrally resolved EL maps confirmed the\npresence of two main transitions in the spectra, and suggested that they are\nemitted by the majority of single nano-LEDs. In order to elucidate the physical\norigin of this effect, we performed theoretical calculations of the strain,\nelectric field, and charge density distributions both for planar LEDs and\nNW-LEDs. On this basis, we simulated also the EL spectra of these devices,\nwhich exhibit a double peak structure for N-polar heterostructures, both in the\nNW and the planar case. In contrast, this feature is not observed when Ga-polar\nplanar LEDs are simulated. We found that the physical origin of the double peak\nstructure is a stronger quantum-confined Stark effect occurring in the first\nand last quantum well of the N-polar heterostructures. The peculiar evolution\nof the relative peak intensities with injected current, seen only in the case\nof the NW-LED, is attributed to the three-dimensional strain variation\nresulting from elastic relaxation at the free sidewalls of the NWs. Therefore,\nthis study provides important insights on the working principle of N-polar LEDs\nbased on both planar and NW heterostructures.\n", "  In this paper we construct the Quantum Gau\\ss Jordan Elimination (QGJE)\nAlgorithm and estimate the complexity time of computation of Reduced Row\nEchelon Form (RREF) of an $N\\times N$ matrix using QGJE procedure. The main\ntheorem asserts that QGJE has computation time of order $2^{N/2}$.\n", "  The paper is devoted to a new idea of simulation of accounting by quantum\ncomputing. We expose the actual accounting principles in a pure mathematics\nlanguage. After that we simulated the accounting principles on quantum\ncomputers. We show that all arbitrary accounting actions are exhausted by the\ndescribed basic actions. The main problem of accounting are reduced to some\nsystem of linear equations in the economic model of Leontief. In this\nsimulation we use our constructed quantum Gau\\ss-Jordan Elimination to solve\nthe problem and the time of quantum computing is some square root order faster\nthan the time in classical computing.\n"]}
