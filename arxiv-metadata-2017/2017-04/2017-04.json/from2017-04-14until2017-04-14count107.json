In the transformed\ncourses, which were designed to address student difficulties found in previous\nresearch, students still struggle with many of the same issues found in other\ncourses. However, the reasons for these difficulties are more subtle, and many\nnew issues are brought to the surface. By explicitly addressing how to build\nmodels of wave functions and energy and how to relate these models to real\nphysical systems, we have opened up a floodgate of deep and difficult questions\nas students struggle to make sense of these models. We conclude that the\ndifficulties found in previous research are the tip of the iceberg, and the\nreal issue at the heart of student difficulties in learning quantum tunneling\nis the struggle to build the complex models that are implicit in experts'\nunderstanding but often not explicitly addressed in instruction.\n", "  Temporal analysis of radiation from Astrophysical sources like Active\nGalactic Nuclei, X-ray Binaries and Gamma-ray bursts provide information on the\ngeometry and sizes of the emitting regions. Establishing that two light-curves\nin different energy bands are correlated and measuring the phase and time-lag\nbetween them is an important and frequently used temporal diagnostic. In the\npresent work, expressions to estimate the errors on the cross-correlation,\nphase and time-lag between two light-curves are presented and the same have\nbeen verified using simulations. Earlier estimates depended upon numerically\nexpensive simulations or on dividing the light-curves in large number of\nsegments to find the variance. The estimates presented here allow for analysis\nof light-curves with relatively small (~1000) number of points, as well as to\nobtain information on the longest time-scales available. The error estimation\nis verified using simulations of light-curves derived from both white and 1/f\nstochastic processes with measurement errors. As a demonstration, we apply this\ntechnique to the XMM-Newton light-curves of the Active Galactic Nucleus, Akn\n564.\n", "  We prove that the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field describes the\nasymptotics of global fluctuations of a multilevel extension of the general\nbeta Jacobi random matrix ensembles. Our approach is based on the connection of\nthe Jacobi ensembles to a degeneration of the Macdonald processes that\nparallels the degeneration of the Macdonald polynomials to to the Heckman-Opdam\nhypergeometric functions (of type A). We also discuss the beta goes to infinity\nlimit.\n", "  The nondestructive imaging of subsurface structures on the nanometer scale\nhas been a long-standing desire in both science and industry. A few impressive\nimages were published so far that demonstrate the general feasibility by\ncombining ultrasound with an Atomic Force Microscope. From different excitation\nschemes, Heterodyne Force Microscopy seems to be the most promising candidate\ndelivering the highest contrast and resolution. However, the physical contrast\nmechanism is unknown, thereby preventing any quantitative analysis of samples.\nHere we show that friction at material boundaries within the sample is\nresponsible for the contrast formation. This result is obtained by performing a\nfull quantitative analysis, in which we compare our experimentally observed\ncontrasts with simulations and calculations. Surprisingly, we can rule out all\nother generally believed responsible mechanisms, like Rayleigh scattering,\nsample (visco)elasticity, damping of the ultrasonic tip motion, and ultrasound\nattenuation. Our analytical description paves the way for quantitative\nSubSurface-AFM imaging.\n", "  We report on the inclusive J/psi nuclear modification factor in p-Pb\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV as a function of rapidity y and transverse\nmomentum p_T. The experimental coverage extends down to p_T = 0 GeV/c in the\nthree rapidity ranges accessible by ALICE (-4.46 < y_cms < -2.96, -1.37 < y_cms\n< 0.46, 2.03 < y_cms < 3.53). The obtained results as a function of rapidity\nare in agreement with theory predictions based only on shadowing or on coherent\nenergy loss. At forward and backward rapidity, the psi(2S) measurement\ncomplements the J/psi results. The ratio between the psi(2S) and J/psi cross\nsection is significantly smaller in p-Pb than in pp collisions in both rapidity\nregions.\n", "  The domain of outer communication of five-dimensional asymptotically flat\nstationary spacetimes may possess non-trivial 2-cycles. We discuss how this may\nlead to a gross violation of black hole uniqueness, beyond the existence of\nblack rings, even for solutions with two commuting rotational symmetries. We\nillustrate this with a simple example in minimal supergravity; a four parameter\nfamily of supersymmetric black hole solutions, with spherical horizon topology\nand a 2-cycle in the exterior. We show there are black holes in this family\nwith identical conserved changes to the BMPV black hole, thereby demonstrating\nblack hole non-uniqueness in this context. We find a decoupling limit of this\nfamily of black holes that yields spacetimes asymptotic to the near-horizon\ngeometry of a BMPV black hole which contain a black hole and an exterior\n2-cycle.\n", "  A significant part of quantum theory can be obtained from a single innovation\nrelative to classical theories, namely, that there is a fundamental restriction\non the sorts of statistical distributions over physical states that can be\nprepared. This is termed an \"epistemic restriction\" because it implies a\nfundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about\nthe physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of\nepistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical\ntheory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and\ndiscrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction\ncalled classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all\nknown epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic\nstructure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to\nan arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a\nkind of quasi-quantization scheme; \"quasi\" because it generally only yields a\ntheory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and\nmeasurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and\nbecause in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is\na distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum\nphenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise\nin an epistricted theory.\n", "  We investigate iterated integrals on an elliptic curve, which are a natural\ngenus-one generalization of multiple polylogarithms. These iterated integrals\ncoincide with the multiple elliptic polylogarithms introduced by Brown and\nLevin when constrained to the real line. At unit argument they reduce to an\nelliptic analogue of multiple zeta values, whose network of relations we start\nto explore. A simple and natural application of this framework are one-loop\nscattering amplitudes in open superstring theory. In particular, elliptic\nmultiple zeta values are a suitable language to express their low energy limit.\nSimilar to the techniques available at tree-level, our formalism allows to\ncompletely automatize the calculation.\n", "  We assume that M is a phase space and H an Hilbert space yielded by a\nquantization scheme. In this paper we consider the set of all \"experimental\npropositions\" of M and we look for a model of quantum logic in relation to the\nquantization of the base manifold M. In particular we give a new interpretation\nabout previous results of the author in order to build an \"asymptotic quantum\nprobability space\" for the Hilbert lattice L(H).\n", "  We describe the quantum dynamics of a magnetic rigid rotor in the mesoscopic\nscale where the Einstein-De Haas effect is predominant. In particular, we\nconsider a single-domain magnetic nanoparticle with uniaxial anisotropy in a\nmagnetic trap. Starting from the basic Hamiltonian of the system under the\nmacrospin approximation, we derive a bosonized Hamiltonian describing the\ncenter-of-mass motion, the total angular momentum, and the macrospin degrees of\nfreedom of the particle treated as a rigid body. This bosonized Hamiltonian can\nbe approximated by a simple quadratic Hamiltonian that captures the rich\nphysics of a nanomagnet tightly confined in position, nearly not spinning, and\nwith its macrospin anti-aligned to the magnetic field. The theoretical tools\nderived and used here can be applied to other quantum mechanical rigid rotors.\n", "  Zero-range processes with decreasing jump rates are well known to exhibit a\ncondensation transition under certain conditions on the jump rates, and the\ndynamics of this transition continues to be a subject of current research\ninterest. Starting from homogeneous initial conditions, the time evolution of\nthe condensed phase exhibits an interesting coarsening phenomenon of mass\ntransport between cluster sites characterized by a power law. We revisit the\napproach in [C. Godreche, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 36(23) 6313 (2003)] to derive\neffective single site dynamics which form a non-linear birth death chain\ndescribing the coarsening behaviour. We extend these results to a larger class\nof parameter values, and introduce a size-biased version of the single site\nprocess, which provides an effective tool to analyze the dynamics of the\ncondensed phase without finite size effects and is the main novelty of this\npaper. Our results are based on a few heuristic assumptions and exact\ncomputations, and are corroborated by detailed simulation data.\n", "  The main promise of quantum computing is to efficiently solve certain\nproblems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most\nproblems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black\nbox, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the\nalgorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the\nnumber of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability.\nFew-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa and\nGrover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear\nmagnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting\ncircuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved\nclassically with a few oracle queries, and the attainable quantum advantage is\nmodest. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with\nnoise, using a five-qubit superconducting processor. Running classical and\nquantum algorithms on the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in\nfavor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude\nas a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates\nthat, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal\nquantum computing, a quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy\nsystems\n", "  An explicit formula is derived for the generating function of vertical\nD4-D2-D0 bound states on smooth K3 fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds, generalizing\nprevious results of Gholampour and Sheshmani. It is also shown that this\nformula satisfies strong modularity properties, as predicted by string theory.\nThis leads to a new construction of vector valued modular forms which exhibits\nsome of the features of a generalized Hecke transform.\n", "  The study of light-matter interaction has led to many fundamental discoveries\nas well as numerous important technologies. Over the last decades, great\nstrides have been made in increasing the strength of this interaction at the\nsingle-photon level, leading to a continual exploration of new physics and\napplications. Recently, a major achievement has been the demonstration of the\nso-called strong coupling regime, a key advancement enabling great progress in\nquantum information science. Here, we demonstrate light-matter interaction over\nan order of magnitude stronger than previously reported, reaching the\nnonperturbative regime of ultrastrong coupling (USC). We achieve this using a\nsuperconducting artificial atom tunably coupled to the electromagnetic\ncontinuum of a one-dimensional waveguide. For the largest coupling, the\nspontaneous emission rate of the atom exceeds its transition frequency. In this\nUSC regime, the description of atom and light as distinct entities breaks down,\nand a new description in terms of hybrid states is required. Our results open\nthe door to a wealth of new physics and applications. Beyond light-matter\ninteraction itself, the tunability of our system makes it a promising tool to\nstudy a number of important physical systems such as the well-known spin-boson\nand Kondo models.\n", "  In this paper we study the interaction of Gaussian solitons in a dispersive\nand nonlinear media with log-law nonlinearity. The model is described by the\ncoupled logarithmic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, which is a nonintegrable\nsystem that allows the observation of a very rich scenario in the collision\npatterns. By employing a variational approach and direct numerical simulations,\nwe observe a fractal-scattering phenomenon from the exit velocities of each\nsoliton as a function of the input velocities. Furthermore, we introduce a\nlinearization model to identify the position of the reflection/transmission\nwindow that emerges within the chaotic region. This enable us the possibility\nof controlling the scattering of solitons as well as the lifetime of bound\nstates.\n", "  We study the impact of new metallicity measurements, from solar wind data, on\nthe solar model. The \"solar modelling problem\" refers to the persisting\ndiscrepancy between helioseismological observations and predictions of solar\nmodels computed implementing state-of-the-art photospheric abundances. We\ncritically reassess the problem, in particular considering the new set of\nabundances of von Steiger \\& Zurbuchen 2016, determined through the \\textit{in\nsitu} collection of solar wind samples from polar coronal holes. This new set\nof abundances indicates a solar metallicity $Z_{\\odot} \\geq 0.0196 \\pm 0.0014$,\nsignificantly higher than the currently established value. The new values hint\nat an abundance of volatile elements (i.e. C, N, O, Ne) close to previous\nresults of Grevesse \\& Sauval 1998, whereas the abundance of refractory\nelements (i.e. Mg, Si, S, Fe) is considerably increased. Using the Linear Solar\nModel formalism, we determine the variation of helioseismological observables\nin response to the changes in elemental abundances, in order to explore the\nconsistency of these new measurements with constraints from helioseismology. We\nfind that, for observables that are particularly sensitive to the abundance of\nvolatile elements, in particular the radius of the convective zone boundary\n(CZB) and the sound speed around the radius of CZB, improved agreement over\nprevious models is obtained. Conversely, the high abundance of refractories\ncorrelates with a higher core temperature, resulting in an overproduction of\nneutrinos and a huge increase in the surface Helium abundance. We conclude that\nthe \"solar modelling problem\" remains unsolved.\n", "  Quantum nature of classical flat Kasner spacetime is studied using effective\nspacetime description in loop quantum cosmology. We find that even though the\nspacetime curvature vanishes at the classical level, non-trivial quantum\ngravitational effects can arise. For the standard loop quantization of\nBianchi-I spacetime, which uniquely yields universal bounds on expansion and\nshear scalars and results in a generic resolution of strong singularities, we\nfind that a flat Kasner metric is not a physical solution of the effective\nspacetime description, except in a limit. The lack of a flat Kasner metric at\nthe quantum level results from a novel feature of the loop quantum Bianchi-I\nspacetime: quantum geometry induces non-vanishing spacetime curvature\ncomponents, making it not Ricci flat even when no matter is present. The\nnon-curvature singularity of the classical flat Kasner spacetime is avoided,\nand the effective spacetime transits from a flat Kasner spacetime in asymptotic\nfuture, to a Minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past. Interestingly, for an\nalternate loop quantization which does not share some of the fine features of\nthe standard quantization, flat Kasner spacetime with expected classical\nfeatures exists. In this case, even with non-trivial quantum geometric effects,\nthe spacetime curvature vanishes. These examples show that the character of\neven a flat classical vacuum spacetime can alter in a fundamental way in\nquantum gravity and is sensitive to the quantization procedure.\n", "  Charge carriers in the quantum Hall regime propagate via one-dimensional\nconducting channels that form along the edges of a two-dimensional electron\ngas. Controlling their transmission through a gate-tunable constriction, also\ncalled quantum point contact (QPC), is fundamental for many coherent transport\nexperiments. However, in graphene, tailoring a QPC with electrostatic gates\nremains challenging due to the formation of p-n junctions below gate electrodes\nalong which electron and hole edge channels co-propagate and mix,\nshort-circuiting the constriction. Here we show that this electron-hole mixing\nis drastically reduced in high mobility boron-nitride/graphene/boron-nitride\nvan-der-Waals heterostructures thanks to the full degeneracy lifting of the\nLandau levels, enabling QPC operation with full channel pinch-off. We\ndemonstrate gate-tunable selective transmission of quantum Hall edge channels\nthrough the QPC, both in the integer and the fractional quantum Hall regimes.\nThis gate-control of edge channel propagation in graphene van-der-Waals\nheterostructures opens the door to quantum Hall interferometry and electron\nquantum optics experiments in the integer and fractional quantum Hall regimes\nof graphene.\n", "  Complex networks are a recent type of frameworks used to study complex\nsystems with many interacting elements, such as Self-Organized Criticality\n(SOC). The network node's tendency to link to other nodes of similar type is\ncharacterized by assortative mixing. Real networks exhibit assortative mixing\nby vertex degree, however typical random network models, such as Erdos-Renyi or\nBarabasi-Albert, show no assortative arrangements. In this paper we introduce\nthe neighborhood assortativity notion, as the tendency of a node to belong to a\ncommunity (its neighborhood) showing an average property similar to its own.\nImposing neighborhood assortative mixing by degree in a network toy model, SOC\ndynamics can be found. The long-range correlations resulting from the\ncriticality have been characterized by means of fluctuation analysis and show\nan anticorrelation in the node's activity. The model contains only one\nparameter and its statistics plots for different values of the parameter can be\ncollapsed into a single curve. The simplicity of the model allows performing\nnumerical simulations and also to study analytically the statistics for a\nspecific value of the parameter, making use of the Markov chains.\n", "  Resolution of singularities in the Kantowski-Sachs model due to\nnon-perturbative quantum gravity effects is investigated. Using the effective\nspacetime description for the improved dynamics version of loop quantum\nKantowski-Sachs spacetimes, we show that even though expansion and shear\nscalars are universally bounded, there can exist events where curvature\ninvariants can diverge. However, such events can occur only for very exotic\nequations of state when pressure or derivatives of energy density with respect\nto triads become infinite at a finite energy density. In all other cases\ncurvature invariants are proved to remain finite for any evolution in finite\nproper time. We find the novel result that all strong singularities are\nresolved for arbitrary matter. Weak singularities pertaining to above potential\ncurvature divergence events can exist. The effective spacetime is found to be\ngeodesically complete for particle and null geodesics in finite time evolution.\nOur results add to a growing evidence for generic resolution of strong\nsingularities using effective dynamics in loop quantum cosmology by\ngeneralizing earlier results on isotropic and Bianchi-I spacetimes.\n", "  The solutions of SDEs with multiplicative noise are not Markovian. On a\ncoarse-grained time scale they still are, but only in the \"anti-Ito\" case. This\nallows a simple computation of the most likely path. Any density peak moves\nalong such a path, and its shape evolves according to further analytical\nformulas. This even provides some new insights into the asymptotic densities\nfor large times, e.g. the criterion for attaining a quiescent steady state.\n", "  Invariant conditions for conformable fractional problems of the calculus of\nvariations under the presence of external forces in the dynamics are studied.\nDepending on the type of transformations considered, different necessary\nconditions of invariance are obtained. As particular cases, we prove fractional\nversions of Noether's symmetry theorem. Invariant conditions for fractional\noptimal control problems, using the Hamiltonian formalism, are also\ninvestigated. As an example of potential application in Physics, we show that\nwith conformable derivatives it is possible to formulate an Action Principle\nfor particles under frictional forces that is far simpler than the one obtained\nwith classical fractional derivatives.\n", "  In light of the known Higgs mass and the current constraints on the\nquark-lepton Higgs coupling, we derive conditions for extracting upper limits\non the lepton-nucleon Higgs coupling from light atoms and ions, assuming the\navailability of locally precise two- and three-body methods might be\nbeneficial. A recent work has proposed to extract these limits in heavy atoms\nwhere the Higgs term is enhanced by $\\approx 10^3 AZ$, due to both the large\ncoupling modifier and large $A$, $Z$, and assuming sufficiently precise\nrelativistic electron wave functions. We first revisit the old idea of using\nthe Lamb shift in light muonic ions where the coupling is enhanced by about\n$201^3 AZ^3$ primarily due to the concentration of the muon wave function at\nthe origin, the muon coupling modifier already being close to 1. For the muonic\nhelium an experimental precision below 0.1 ppm is required to reach the\nconstraints on Higgs couplings. However, theoretical uncertainty is large due\nto nuclear potential dependence of the finite size terms enhanced by the small\nmuon orbit, and their elimination by using several states is precluded due to\nthe Lamb shift being the only precisely measurable state. In normal\n(electronic) light systems transitions between low-lying states lie near the\noptical region allowing precise experiments, and extraction may be possible by\neliminating the finite-size, polarization and Zemach moment terms from a set of\ntransitions, e.g. $1S-2S$ and improved $2^3S-2^3P$ and $2^1S-2^3S$ in ${\\rm\nHe}^+$, while isotope shifts could be used if additional transitions are\nmeasured as precisely.\n", "  The annihilation of dark matter particles is expected to yield a broad\nradiation spectrum via the production of Standard Model particles in\nastrophysical environments. In particular, electrons and positrons from dark\nmatter annihilation produce synchrotron radiation in the presence of magnetic\nfields. Galaxy clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the\nuniverse, and are known to host $\\sim\\mu$G-scale magnetic fields. They are\ntherefore ideal targets to search for, or to constrain the synchrotron signal\nfrom dark matter annihilation. In this work we use the expected sensitivities\nof several planned surveys from the next generation of radio telescopes to\npredict the constraints on dark matter annihilation models which will be\nachieved in the case of non-detections of diffuse radio emission from galaxy\nclusters. Specifically, we consider the Tier 1 survey planned for the Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR) at 120 MHz, the EMU survey planned for the Australian\nSquare Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 1.4 GHz, and planned surveys for\nAPERTIF at 1.4 GHz. We find that, for massive clusters and dark matter masses\n$\\lesssim 100$ GeV, the predicted limits on the annihilation cross section\nwould rule out vanilla thermal relic models for even the shallow LOFAR Tier 1,\nASKAP, and APERTIF surveys.\n", "  We present new MUSE observations of a galaxy group probed by a background\nquasar. The quasar sightline passes between multiple $z=0.28$ galaxies, whilst\nshowing at the same redshift low ionised metal line species, including Ca II,\nMg I, Mg II and Fe II. Based on the galaxy redshifts measured from the MUSE\ndata, we estimate the galaxies to be part of a small galaxy group with a halo\nmass of $\\approx6\\times10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We use the MUSE data to reveal the\ntwo dimensional dynamical properties of the gas and stars in the group\ngalaxies, and relate these to the absorber kinematics. With these data we\nconsider a number of scenarios for the nature of the gas probed by the\nsightline absorbers: a co-rotating gas halo associated with a single galaxy\nwithin the group; outflowing material from a single group member powered by\nrecent star-formation; and cool dense gas associated with an intra-group\nmedium. We find that the dynamics, galaxy impact parameters, star-formation\nrates, and the absorber strength suggest the cool gas can not be clearly\nassociated with any single galaxy within the group. Instead we find that the\nobservations are consistent with a superposition of cool gas clouds originating\nwith the observed galaxies as they fall into the group potential, and are now\nlikely in the process of forming the intra-group medium.\n", "  We discuss how nonlocality originates in long-range quantum systems and how\nit affects their dynamics at and out of the equilibrium. We focus in particular\non the Kitaev chains with long-range pairings and on the quantum Ising chain\nwith long-range antiferromagnetic coupling (both having a power-law decay with\nexponent \\alpha). By studying the dynamic correlation functions, we find that\nfor every finite \\alpha two different behaviours can be identified, one typical\nof short-range systems and the other connected with locality violation. The\nlatter behaviour is shown related also with the known power-law decay tails\npreviously observed in the static correlation functions, and originated by\nmodes, having in general energies far from the minima of the spectrum, where\nparticular singularities develop as a consequence of the long-rangedness of the\nsystem. We refer to these modes as to \"singular\" modes, and as to \"singular\ndynamics\" to their dynamics. For the Kitaev model they are manifest, at finite\n\\alpha, in derivatives of the quasiparticle energy, the order of the derivative\nat which the singularity occurs increasing with \\alpha. The features of the\nsingular modes and their physical consequences are clarified by studying an\neffective theory for them and by a critical comparison of the results from this\ntheory with the lattice ones. Moreover, a numerical study of the effects of the\nsingular modes on the time evolution after various types of global quenches is\nperformed. We finally present and discuss the presence of singular modes and\ntheir consequences in interacting long-range systems by investigating in the\nlong-range Ising quantum chain, both in the deep paramagnetic regime and at\ncriticality, where they also play a central role for the breakdown of conformal\ninvariance.\n", "  The fraction of galaxies with strong Ly$\\alpha$ emission has been observed to\ndecrease rapidly with redshift at $z \\ge 6$, after a gradual increase at $z<\n6$. This has been interpreted as a hint of the reionization of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM): the emitted Ly$\\alpha$ photons would be scattered\nby an increasingly neutral IGM at $z>6$. We study this effect by modeling the\nionization and Ly$\\alpha$ radiative transfer in the infall region and the IGM\naround a Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxy (LAE), for a spherical halo model with the\nmean density and radial velocity profiles in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological scenario. We find that the expected fast increase of the ionizing\nbackground intensity toward the end of the reionization epoch implies a rapid\nevolution of halo infall regions from being self-shielded against the external\nionizing background to being mostly ionized. Whereas self-shielded infall\nregions can scatter the Ly$\\alpha$ photons over a much larger area than the\ncommonly used apertures for observing LAEs, the same infalling gas is no longer\noptically thick to the Ly$\\alpha$ emission line after it is ionized by the\nexternal background, making the Ly$\\alpha$ emission more compact and brighter\nwithin the observed apertures. Based on this simple model, we show that the\nobserved drop in the abundance of LAEs at $z>6$ does not imply a rapid increase\nwith redshift of the fraction of the whole IGM volume that is atomic, but is\naccounted for by a rapid increase of the neutral fraction in the infall regions\naround galaxy host halos.\n", "  We observe non-monotonic aging and memory effects, two hallmarks of glassy\ndynamics, in two disordered mechanical systems: crumpled thin sheets and\nelastic foams. Under fixed compression, both systems exhibit monotonic\nnon-exponential relaxation. However, when after a certain waiting time the\ncompression is partially reduced, both systems exhibit a non-monotonic\nresponse: the normal force first increases over many minutes or even hours\nuntil reaching a peak value, and only then relaxation is resumed. The peak-time\nscales linearly with the waiting time, indicating that these systems retain\nlong-lasting memory of previous conditions. Our results and the measured\nscaling relations are in good agreement with a theoretical model recently used\nto describe observations of monotonic aging in several glassy systems,\nsuggesting that the non-monotonic behavior may be generic and that a-thermal\nsystems can show genuine glassy behavior.\n", "  We show that certain solutions to the linearized Einstein equation can---by\nthe application of a particular type of linearized gauge transformation---be\nstraightforwardly transformed into solutions of the exact Einstein equation. In\ncases with nontrivial matter content, the exact stress-energy tensor of the\ntransformed metric has the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors as the linearized\nstress-energy tensor of the initial approximation. When our gauge exists, the\ntensorial structure of transformed metric perturbations identically eliminates\nall nonlinearities in Einstein's equation. As examples, we derive the exact\nKerr and gravitational plane wave metrics from standard harmonic-gauge\napproximations.\n", "  The nonperturbative quantization technique \\`{a} la Heisenberg is applied for\nnon-Abelian gauge theories. The operator Yang-Mills equation is written, which\non the corresponding averaging gives an infinite set of equations for all Green\nfunctions. We split all degrees of freedom into two groups: in the former, we\nhave $A^a_\\mu \\in \\mathcal G \\subset SU(N)$, and in the second group we have\ncoset degrees of freedom $SU(N) / \\mathcal G$. Using such splitting and some\nassumptions about 2- and 4-point Green functions, we truncate the infinite set\nof equations to two equations. The first equation is for the gauge fields from\nthe subgroup $\\mathcal G$, and the second equation is for a gluon condensate\nwhich is the dispersion of quantum fluctuations of the coset fields. Two\nexamples are considered: The first one is a flux tube solution describing\nlongitudinal color electric fields stretched between quark and antiquark\nlocated at the $\\pm$ infinities. The second one is a flux tube stretched\nbetween two quarks (antiquarks) located at $\\pm \\infty$. A special case is\nconsidered when the longitudinal electric field produced by a quark located at\n$+ \\infty$ is equal and oppositely directed to the field generated by a quark\nlocated at $- \\infty$ that leads to zero total electric field. Both solutions\nrepresents the dual Meissner effect: the electric field is pushed out from the\ngluon condensate.\n", "  The spatially closed Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker model in loop\nquantum cosmology admits two inequivalent consistent quantizations: one based\non expressing the field strength in terms of the holonomies over closed loops,\nand, another using a connection operator and open holonomies. Using the\neffective dynamics, we investigate the phenomenological differences between the\ntwo quantizations for the single fluid and the two fluid scenarios with various\nequations of state, including the phantom matter. We show that a striking\ndifference between the two quantizations is the existence of two distinct\nquantum turnarounds, either bounces or recollapses, in the connection\nquantization, in contrast to a single distinct quantum bounce or a recollapse\nin the holonomy quantization. These results generalize an earlier result on the\nexistence of two distinct quantum bounces for stiff matter by Corichi and\nKarami. However, we find that in certain situations two distinct quantum\nturnarounds can become virtually indistinguishable. And depending on the\ninitial conditions, a pure quantum cyclic universe can also exist undergoing a\nquantum bounce and a quantum recollapse. We show that for various equations of\nstates, connection based quantization leads to super-Planckian values of the\nenergy density and the expansion scalar at quantum turnarounds. Interestingly,\nwe find that very extreme energy densities can also occur for the holonomy\nquantization, breaching the maximum allowed density in the spatially flat loop\nquantized model. However, the expansion scalar in all these cases is bounded by\na universal value.\n", "  The potential of the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb detectors for the measurement\nof quarkonium in heavy-ion collisions, both in nucleus-nucleus (A-A) and in\nproton-nucleus (p-A) interactions, in the years 2015 until about 2030 in the\nLHC Runs 2, 3 and 4 with larger statistics and detector upgrades is described.\nA selection of newly available observables is discussed.\n", "  Several possibilities to relate the $t$-dependence of Generalized Parton\nDistributions (GPDs) to the distribution of angular momentum in the transverse\nplane are discussed. Using a simple spectator model we demonstrate that non of\nthem correctly describes the orbital angular momentum distribution that for a\nlongitudinally polarized nucleon obtained directly from light-front\nwavefunctions.\n", "  The use of the generalized Snell's law opens wide possibilities for the\nmanipulation of transmitted and reflected wavefronts. However, known structures\ndesigned to shape reflection wave fronts suffer from significant parasitic\nreflections in undesired directions: In fact, the desired field distributions\ndo not satisfy Maxwell's equations if the boundary conditions are specified in\naccordance with the generalized Snell's law. In this work, we explore the\nlimitations of the existing solutions for the design of passive planar\nreflectors and demonstrate that strongly non-local response is required for\nperfect performance. Ideal reflective surfaces capable of steering the energy\ninto any desired direction have to localize and carry energy along the\ninhomogeneous reflective surface. A new paradigm for the design of perfect\nreflectors based on energy surface channeling is introduced. We realize and\nexperimentally verify a theoretically perfect design of an anomalously\nreflective surface using an array of rectangular metal patches backed by a\nmetallic plate. This conceptually new mechanism for wavefront manipulation\nallows the design of thin perfect reflectors, offering a versatile design\nmethod applicable to other scenarios such as focusing reflectors or surface\nwave manipulations, extendible to other frequencies.\n", "  Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex\nstellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for\nmodels: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy\nphotometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key\nquestions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present\na new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model,\nProspector-$\\alpha$, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible\nattenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component\nnonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the\nparameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference\nframework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars.\nWe assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy,\nwhich was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely\nfrom fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our\nmodel predicts H$\\alpha$ luminosities with a scatter of $\\sim$0.18 dex and an\noffset of $\\sim$0.1 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar\nmasses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H$\\alpha$ luminosity is dependent\non accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities.\nThe model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements,\nspectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and\nmetallicity-sensitive features D$_{\\mathrm{n}}$4000 and H$\\delta$. Although the\nmodel passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its\nperformance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.\n", "  We report the first calculation of fully differential jet production in all\npartonic channels at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD\nand compare to the available ATLAS 7 TeV data. We discuss the size and shape of\nthe perturbative corrections along with their associated scale variation across\na wide range in jet transverse momentum, $p_{T}$, and rapidity, $y$. We find\nsignificant effects, especially at low $p_{T}$, and discuss the possible\nimplications for Parton Distribution Function fits.\n", "  Cosmological equations were recently derived by Padmanabhan from the\nexpansion of cosmic space due to the difference between the degrees of freedom\non the surface and in the bulk in a region of space. In this study, a modified\nR\\'{e}nyi entropy is applied to Padmanabhan's `holographic equipartition law',\nby regarding the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy as a nonextensive Tsallis entropy\nand using a logarithmic formula of the original R\\'{e}nyi entropy.\nConsequently, the acceleration equation including an extra driving term (such\nas a time-varying cosmological term) can be derived in a homogeneous,\nisotropic, and spatially flat universe. When a specific condition is\nmathematically satisfied, the extra driving term is found to be constant-like\nas if it is a cosmological constant. Interestingly, the order of the\nconstant-like term is naturally consistent with the order of the cosmological\nconstant measured by observations, because the specific condition constrains\nthe value of the constant-like term.\n", "  We study here the precession of the spin of a test gyroscope attached to a\nstationary observer in the Kerr spacetime, specifically, to distinguish naked\nsingularity (NS) from black hole (BH). It was shown recently that for gyros\nattached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily\nlarge in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane\nprecession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that\nclear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation\nfeatures. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with\napproach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then\ndecreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a\ncertain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain\nrange of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains\npositive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT\nfrequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to\nobserved QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given\nrotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS.\n", "  We study gauge symmetry breaking by adiabatic approximation in the adiabatic\nself-consistent collective coordinate (ASCC) method. In the previous study, we\nfound that the gauge symmetry of the equation of collective submanifold is\n(partially) broken by its decomposition into the three moving-frame equations\ndepending on the order of $p$. In this study, we discuss the gauge symmetry\nbreaking by the truncation of the adiabatic expansion. A particular emphasis is\nplaced on the symmetry under the gauge transformations which are not point\ntransformations. We also discuss a possible version of the ASCC method\nincluding the higher-order operators which can keep the gauge symmetry.\n", "  We present results from an analysis looking for dark matter annihilation in\nthe Sun with the IceCube neutrino telescope. Gravitationally trapped dark\nmatter in the Sun's core can annihilate into Standard Model particles making\nthe Sun a source of GeV neutrinos. IceCube is able to detect neutrinos with\nenergies >100 GeV while its low-energy infill array DeepCore extends this to\n>10 GeV. This analysis uses data gathered in the austral winters between May\n2011 and May 2014, corresponding to 532 days of livetime when the Sun, being\nbelow the horizon, is a source of up-going neutrino events, easiest to\ndiscriminate against the dominant background of atmospheric muons. The\nsensitivity is a factor of two to four better than previous searches due to\nadditional statistics and improved analysis methods involving better background\nrejection and reconstructions. The resultant upper limits on the spin-dependent\ndark matter-proton scattering cross section reach down to $1.46\\times10^{-5}$\npb for a dark matter particle of mass 500 GeV annihilating exclusively into\n$\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ particles. These are currently the most stringent limits on\nthe spin-dependent dark matter-proton scattering cross section for WIMP masses\nabove 50 GeV.\n", "  We consider large random matrices $X$ with centered, independent entries\nwhich have comparable but not necessarily identical variances. Girko's circular\nlaw asserts that the spectrum is supported in a disk and in case of identical\nvariances, the limiting density is uniform. In this special case, the local\ncircular law by Bourgade et. al. [11,12] shows that the empirical density\nconverges even locally on scales slightly above the typical eigenvalue spacing.\nIn the general case, the limiting density is typically inhomogeneous and it is\nobtained via solving a system of deterministic equations. Our main result is\nthe local inhomogeneous circular law in the bulk spectrum on the optimal scale\nfor a general variance profile of the entries of $X$.\n", "  Entanglement renormalization can be viewed as an encoding circuit for a\nfamily of approximate quantum error correcting codes. The logical information\nbecomes progressively more well-protected against erasure errors at larger\nlength scales. In particular, an approximate variant of holographic quantum\nerror correcting code emerges at low energy for critical systems. This implies\nthat two operators that are largely separated in scales behave as if they are\nspatially separated operators, in the sense that they obey a Lieb-Robinson type\nlocality bound under a time evolution generated bya local Hamiltonian.\n", "  We report magnon spin transport in nickel ferrite (NiFe$_2$O$_4$, NFO)/\nplatinum (Pt) bilayer systems at room temperature. A nonlocal geometry is\nemployed, where the magnons are excited by the spin Hall effect or by the Joule\nheating induced spin Seebeck effect at the Pt injector, and detected at a\ncertain distance away by the inverse spin Hall effect at the Pt detector. The\ndependence of the nonlocal magnon spin signals as a function of the magnetic\nfield is closely related to the NFO magnetization behavior. In contrast, we\nobserve that the magnetoresistance measured locally at the Pt injector does not\nshow a clear relation with the average NFO magnetization. We estimate the\nmagnon spin relaxation length to be 3.1 $\\pm$ 0.2 $\\mu$m in the investigated\nNFO samples.\n", "  The ability of a feed-forward neural network to learn and classify different\nstates of polymer configurations is systematically explored. Performing\nnumerical experiments, we find that a simple network model can, after adequate\ntraining, recognize multiple structures, including gas-like coil, liquid-like\nglobular, and crystalline anti-Mackay and Mackay structures. The network can be\ntrained to identify the transition points between various states, which compare\nwell with those identified by independent specific-heat calculations. Our study\ndemonstrates that neural network provides an unconventional tool to study the\nphase transitions in polymeric systems.\n", "  Simulations of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) predict that dark matter\nshould lag behind galaxies during a collision. If the interaction is mediated\nby a high-mass force carrier, the distribution of dark matter can also develop\nasymmetric dark matter tails. To search for this asymmetry, we compute the\ngravitational lensing properties of a mass distribution with a free {\\em\nskewness} parameter. We apply this to the dark matter around the four central\ngalaxies in cluster Abell~3827. In the galaxy whose dark matter peak has\npreviously been found to be offset, we tentatively measure a skewness\n$s=0.23^{+0.05}_{-0.22}$ in the same direction as the peak offset. Our method\nmay be useful in future gravitational lensing analyses of colliding galaxy\nclusters and merging galaxies.\n", "  Due to the numerical complexities of studying evolution in an anisotropic\nquantum spacetime, in comparison to the isotropic models, the physics of loop\nquantized anisotropic models has remained largely unexplored. In particular,\nrobustness of bounce and the validity of effective dynamics have so far not\nbeen established. Our analysis fills these gaps for the case of vacuum\nBianchi-I spacetime. To efficiently solve the quantum Hamiltonian constraint we\nperform an implementation of the Cactus framework which is conventionally used\nfor applications in numerical relativity. Using high performance computing,\nnumerical simulations for a large number of initial states with a wide variety\nof fluctuations are performed. Big bang singularity is found to be replaced by\nanisotropic bounces for all the cases. We find that for initial states which\nare sharply peaked at the late times in the classical regime and bounce at a\nmean volume much greater than the Planck volume, effective dynamics is an\nexcellent approximation to the underlying quantum dynamics. Departures of the\neffective dynamics from the quantum evolution appear for the states probing\ndeep Planck volumes. A detailed analysis of the behavior of this departure\nreveals a non-monotonic and subtle dependence on fluctuations of the initial\nstates. We find that effective dynamics in almost all of the cases\nunderestimates the volume and hence overestimates the curvature at the bounce,\na result in synergy with earlier findings in isotropic case. The expansion and\nshear scalars are found to be bounded throughout the evolution.\n", "  Compensated isocurvature perturbations (CIP), where the baryon and cold dark\nmatter perturbations cancel, do not cause total matter isocurvature\nperturbation. Consequently, at the linear order in the baryon density contrast\n$\\Delta$, CIP is not detectable by the CMB power spectra. At the second order\nCIP smoothes the power spectra in a similar manner as lensing, causing a\ndegeneracy between the CIP variance $\\Delta^2_{rms}=<\\Delta^2>$ and lensing\nparameter $A_L$. We show that the CMB lensing data breaks this degeneracy.\nNested sampling of the LCDM+CIP(+$A_L$) model, the Planck 2015 temperature,\npolarization, and lensing data give $\\Delta^2_{rms}=0.0069\\pm0.0030$ at 68% CL.\nA non-zero value is favored at 2.3$\\sigma$. CIP with $\\Delta^2_{rms}=0.007$\nimproves the bestfit $\\chi^2$ by 3.6 compared to the adiabatic LCDM model. In\ncontrast, although the temperature data favor $A_L=1.22$, allowing $A_L\\ne1$\ndoes not improve the joint fit, since the lensing data disfavor $A_L\\ne1$.\nIndeed, CIP provides a rare example of a simple model, which can reduce the\nPlanck lensing anomaly by fitting well simultaneously the high multipole\ntemperature and lensing data, as well as the polarization data. Finally, we\nderive forecasts for future satellite missions (LiteBIRD proposal to JAXA and\nExploring Cosmic Origins with CORE proposal to ESA's M5 call). Due to its\ncoarse angular resolution, LiteBIRD is not able to improve the constraints on\nCIP or $A_L$, but CORE-M5 approaches the cosmic variance limit and improves the\nCIP constraint to $\\Delta^2_{rms}<0.0006\\ (0.0014)$ at 68% (95%) CL, which is 9\ntimes better than the current trispectrum based upper bound and 6 times better\nthan obtained from the simulated Planck data. In addition, CORE-M5 will\nexquisitely distinguish between CIP and $A_L$. No matter whether CIP is allowed\nfor or not, the uncertainty of the lensing parameter will be\n$\\sigma(A_L)=0.012$.\n", "  We investigate the effect of new physics interacting with both Dark Matter\n(DM) and neutrinos at DM direct detection experiments. Working within a\nsimplified model formalism, we consider vector and scalar mediators to\ndetermine the scattering of DM as well as the modified scattering of solar\nneutrinos off nuclei. Using existing data from LUX as well as the expected\nsensitivity of LUX-ZEPLIN and DARWIN, we set limits on the couplings of the\nmediators to quarks, neutrinos and DM. Given the current limits, we also assess\nthe true DM discovery potential of direct detection experiments under the\npresence of exotic neutrino interactions. In the case of a vector mediator, we\nshow that the DM discovery reach of future experiments is affected for DM\nmasses $m_\\chi \\lesssim 10$ GeV or DM scattering cross sections $\\sigma_\\chi\n\\lesssim 10^{-47}$ cm$^2$. On the other hand, a scalar mediator will not affect\nthe discovery reach appreciably.\n", "  In this paper, we develop an iterative approach to span the whole set of\nexotic matter models able to drive a traversable wormhole. The method, based on\na Taylor expansion of metric and stress-energy tensor components in a\nneighbourhood of the wormhole throat, reduces the Einstein equations to an\ninfinite set of algebraic conditions, which can be satisfied order by order.\nThe approach easily allows the implementation of further conditions linking the\nstress-energy tensor components among each other, like symmetry conditions or\nequations of state. The method is then applied to some relevant examples of\nexotic matter characterised by a constant energy density and that also show an\nisotropic behaviour in the stress-energy tensor or obeying to a\nquintessence-like equation of state.\n", "  The deflection angle of a light ray can be arbitrarily large near a light\nsphere. The time-symmetrical shape of light curves of a pair of light rays\nreflected by a light sphere of a lens object does not depend on the details of\nthe lens object. We consider retrolensing light curves of sunlight with\ndeflection angles $\\pi$ and $3\\pi$ by an Ellis wormhole, which is the simplest\nMorris-Thorne wormhole. If an Ellis wormhole with a throat parameter\n$a=10^{11}$ km is $100$ pc away from an observer and if the Ellis wormhole, the\nobserver, and the sun are aligned perfectly in this order, the apparent\nmagnitudes of a pair of light rays with deflection angles $\\pi$ and $3\\pi$\nbecome $11$ and $18$, respectively. The two pairs of light rays make a\nsuperposed light curve with two separable peaks and they break down time\nsymmetry of a retrolensing light curve. The observation of the two separated\npeaks of the light curves gives us information on the details of the lens\nobject. If the observer can also separate the pair of the images with the\ndeflection angle $\\pi$ into a double image, he or she can say whether the\nretrolensing is caused by an Ellis wormhole or a Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  Excitons and plasmons are the two most fundamental types of collective\nelectronic excitations occurring in solids. Traditionally, they have been\nstudied separately using bulk techniques that probe their average energetic\nstructure over large spatial regions. However, as the dimensions of materials\nand devices continue to shrink, it becomes crucial to understand how these\nexcitations depend on local variations in the crystal- and chemical structure\non the atomic scale. Here we use monochromated low-loss\nscanning-transmission-electron-microscopy electron-energy-loss (LL-STEM-EEL)\nspectroscopy, providing the best simultaneous energy and spatial resolution\nachieved to-date to unravel the full set of electronic excitations in few-layer\nMoS2 nanosheets over a wide energy range. Using first-principles many-body\ncalculations we confirm the excitonic nature of the peaks at ~2eV and ~3eV in\nthe experimental EEL spectrum and the plasmonic nature of higher energy-loss\npeaks. We also rationalise the non-trivial dependence of the EEL spectrum on\nbeam and sample geometry such as the number of atomic layers and distance to\nsteps and edges. Moreover, we show that the excitonic features are dominated by\nthe long wavelength (q=0) components of the probing field, while the plasmonic\nfeatures are sensitive to a much broader range of q-vectors, indicating a\nqualitative difference in the spatial character of the two types of collective\nexcitations. Our work provides a template protocol for mapping the local nature\nof electronic excitations that open new possibilities for studying\nphoto-absorption and energy transfer processes on a nanometer scale.\n", "  It is shown that the relativistic quantum mechanics of a single fermion can\nbe developed only on the basis of the standard representation of the Dirac\nbispinor. As in the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, the arbitrariness in\ndefining the bispinor, as a four-component wave function, is restricted by its\nmultiplication by an arbitrary phase factor. We reveal the role of the large\nand small components of the bispinor, establish their link in the\nnonrelativistic limit with the Pauli spinor, as well as explain the role of\nstates with negative energies. The Klein tunneling is treated here as a\nphysical phenomenon analogous to the propagation of the electromagnetic wave in\na medium with negative dielectric permittivity and permeability. For the case\nof localized stationary states we define the effective one-particle operators\nwhich act in the space of the large component but contain the contributions of\nboth components. The effective operator of energy is presented in a compact\nanalytical form.\n", "  ALMA observations of the long wavelength dust continuum are used to estimate\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) masses in a sample of 708 galaxies at z = 0.3 to\n4.5 in the COSMOS field. The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities\nand, hence, star formation rates (SFRs), and stellar masses (M$_{\\rm *}$) from\nthe optical-infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main\nsequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to\ndetermine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, M$_{\\rm *}$, and specific SFR\n(sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately 0.63 power of\nthe rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the\nsSFR/sSFR$_MS$. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR\nredshift evolutionary and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the\nincreased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses\nand SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function we estimate the\naccretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution\n($>100$ \\msun yr$^{-1}$ at z $>$ 2.5). Simple power-law dependences are\nsimilarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall\nevolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic\nevolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and\nAGN activity at early epochs.\n", "  The first transiting planetesimal orbiting a white dwarf was recently\ndetected in K2 data of WD1145+017 and has been followed up intensively. The\nmultiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust\nclouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system\ncontains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the\nu'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the\nfirst detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using\nsimultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the\nu'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during\ntransits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour\ndifference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for\nthe bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in\nthe spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric\ndata, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of\nreduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This\nindicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,\nand that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if\nthe gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are\npart of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).\nIn addition, we present the results of a week-long monitoring campaign of the\nsystem.\n", "  The classical and quantum properties of a new solution obtained in $2+1$%\n-dimensional gravity coupled with a real scalar field is analyzed in detail.\nThe considered new solution is a one-parameter generalization of a previously\nknown solution. We investigate the solution classically by calculating exact\nnull and null circular geodesics which correspond to a typical particle probe\nof the correspondsing black hole spacetime. The solution admitting naked\nsingularity is investigated within the context of quantum mechanics. The\ntimelike naked singularity is probed with spin-zero and spin-half quantum\nparticles. We show that the curvature singularity in the new solution is\nstronger and hence in general the spacetime remains quantum singular with\nrespect to a quantum particle probe.\n", "  We propose a general framework of the quantum/quasi-classical transformations\nby introducing the concept of quasi-joint-spectral distribution (QJSD).\nSpecifically, we show that the QJSDs uniquely yield various pairs of\nquantum/quasi-classical transformations, including the Wigner-Weyl transform.\nWe also discuss the statistical behaviour of combinations of generally\nnon-commutin quantum observables by introducing the concept of quantum\ncorrelations and conditional expectations defined analogously to the classical\ncounterpart. Based on these, Aharonov's weak value is given a statistical\ninterpretation as one realisation of the quantum conditional expectations\nfurnished in our formalism.\n", "  Building upon known supersymmetric backgrounds, we derive novel half-BPS\nfermionic solutions in three-dimensional supergravity. By virtue of an\nessential dependence on fermionic degrees of freedom, they possess no purely\nbosonic analogue. In the Anti de Sitter case this notably includes nonsingular\nsolutions for which the corresponding Chern-Simons gauge field\n$\\mathcal{A}=\\omega\\pm e/L$ vanishes, providing access to configurations which\nare ordinarily singular in pure gravity.\n", "  The Kapitza or thermal boundary resistance (TBR), which limits heat\ndissipation from a thin film to its substrate, is a major factor in the thermal\nmanagement of ultrathin nanoelectronic devices and is widely assumed to be a\nproperty of only the interface. However, data from experiments and molecular\ndynamics simulations suggest that the TBR between a multilayer 2-dimensional\n(2D) crystal and its substrate decreases with increasing film thickness. To\nexplain this thickness dependence, we generalize the recent theory for\nsingle-layer 2D crystals by Ong, Cai and Zhang [Phys. Rev. B 94, 165427\n(2016)], which is derived from the theory by Persson, Volokitin, and Ueba [J.\nPhys.: Condens. Matter 23, 045009 (2011)], and use it to evaluate the TBR\nbetween bare $N$-layer graphene and SiO$_{2}$. Our calculations reproduce\nquantitatively the TBR thickness dependence seen in experiments and simulations\nas well as its asymptotic convergence, and predict that the low-temperature TBR\nscales as $T^{-4}$ in few-layer graphene. Analysis of the interfacial\ntransmission coefficient spectrum shows that the TBR reduction in few-layer\ngraphene is due to the additional contribution from higher flexural phonon\nbranches. Our theory sheds light on the role of flexural phonons in\nsubstrate-directed heat dissipation and provides the framework for optimizing\nthe thermal management of multilayered 2D devices.\n", "  We have measured the electroluminescence (EL) yield of Xe-CO2 mixtures, with\nsub-percent CO2 concentrations. We demonstrate that the EL production is still\nhigh in these mixtures, 70% and 35% relative to that produced in pure xenon,\nfor CO2 concentrations around 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively. The contribution of\nthe statistical fluctuations in EL production to the energy resolution\nincreases with increasing CO2 concentration and, for our gas proportional\nscintillation counter, it is smaller than the contribution of the Fano factor\nfor concentrations below 0.1% CO2. Xe-CO2 mixtures are important alternatives\nto pure xenon in TPCs based on EL signal amplification with applications in the\nimportant field of rare event detection such as directional dark matter, double\nelectron capture and double beta decay detection. The addition of CO2 to pure\nxenon at the level of 0.05-0.1% can reduce significantly the scale of electron\ndiffusion from 10 mm/sqrt(m) to 2.5 mm/sqrt(m), with high impact on the HPXe\nTPC discrimination efficiency of the events through pattern recognition of the\ntopology of primary ionisation trails.\n", "  We report high field de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect measurements in\nCeRh$_2$Si$_2$ both below and above the first-order 26 T metamagnetic\ntransition from an antiferromagnetic to a polarized paramagnetic state. The\ndHvA frequencies observed above the transition are much higher than those\nobserved below, implying a drastic change of the Fermi-surface size. The dHvA\nfrequencies above the transition and their angular dependence are in good\nagreement with band-structure calculations for LaRh$_2$Si$_2$, which correspond\nto CeRh$_2$Si$_2$ with localized $f$ electrons. Given that the $f$ electrons\nare also localized at low fields in CeRh$_2$Si$_2$, the Fermi-surface\nreconstruction is due to the suppression of antiferromagnetism and the\nrestoration of the crystallographic Brillouin zone rather than the\ndelocalization of the $f$ electrons. This example suggests that the intuitive\nnotation of \"small\" and \"large\" Fermi surfaces commonly used for localized and\nitinerant $f$ electrons, respectively, requires careful consideration, taking\ninto account the modification of the Brillouin zone in the antiferromagnetic\nstate, when interpreting experimental results.\n", "  Dependence of the kinetic energy term of the collective nuclear Hamiltonian\non collective momentum is considered. It is shown that the fourth order in\ncollective momentum term of the collective quadrupole Hamiltonian generates a\nsizable effect on the excitation energies and the matrix elements of the\nquadrupole moment operator. It is demonstrated that the results of calculation\nare sensitive to the values of some matrix elements of the quadrupole moment.\nIt stresses the importance for a concrete nucleus to have the experimental data\nfor the reduced matrix elements of the quadrupole moment operator taken between\nall low lying states with the angular momenta not exceeding 4.\n", "  A new Hamiltonian formulation for the fully nonlinear water-wave problem over\nvariable bathymetry is derived, using an exact, vertical series expansion of\nthe velocity potential, in conjunction with Luke's variational principle. The\nobtained Euler-Lagrange equations contain infinite series and can rederive\nvarious existing model equations upon truncation. In this paper, the infinite\nseries are summed up, resulting in two exact Hamiltonian equations for the\nfree-surface elevation and the free-surface potential, coupled with a\ntime-independent horizontal system of equations. The Dirichlet to Neumann\noperator is given by a simple and versatile representation, which is valid for\nany smooth fluid domain, not necessarily periodic in the horizontal\ndirection(s), without limitations on the steepness and deformation of the\nseabed and the free surface. An efficient numerical scheme is presented and\napplied to the case of one horizontal dimension, establishing the ability of\nthe new formulation to simulate strongly nonlinear and dispersive wave-bottom\ninteractions by comparison with experimental measurements.\n", "  Gravitation, the universal attractive force, acts upon all matter (and\nradiation) relentlessly. Stable extended structures can exist only when gravity\nis held off by other forces of nature. This series of articles explores this\ninterplay, looking at objects that just missed being stars in this particular\ninstalment.\n", "  Studies of meteor trails have until now been limited to relatively simple\nmodels, with the trail often being treated as a conducting cylinder, and the\nhead (if considered at all) treated as a ball of ionized gas. In this article,\nwe bring the experience gleaned in other fields to the domain of meteor\nstudies, and adapt this prior knowledge to give a much clearer view of the\nmicroscale physics and chemistry involved in meteor-trail formation, with\nparticular emphasis on the first 100 or so milliseconds of the trail formation.\nWe discuss and examine the combined physico-chemical effects of\nmeteor-generated and ablationally amplified cylindrical shock waves which\nappear in the ambient atmosphere immediately surrounding the meteor train, as\nwell as the associated hyperthermal chemistry on the boundaries of the high\ntemperature postadiabatically expanding meteor train. We demonstrate that the\ncylindrical shock waves produced by overdense meteors are sufficiently strong\nto dissociate molecules in the ambient atmosphere when it is heated to\ntemperatures in the vicinity of 6,000 K, which substantially alters the\nconsiderations of the chemical processes in and around the meteor train. We\ndemonstrate that some ambient O2, along with O2 that comes from the shock\ndissociation of O3, survives the passage of the cylindrical shock wave, and\nthese constituents react thermally with meteor metal ions, thereby subsequently\nremoving electrons from the overdense meteor train boundary through fast,\ntemperature independent, dissociative recombination governed by the second\nDamkohler number. Possible implications for trail diffusion and lifetimes are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Laser spectroscopic studies on minute samples of exotic radioactive nuclei\nrequire very efficient experimental techniques. In addition, high resolving\npowers are required to allow extraction of nu- clear structure information.\nHere we demonstrate that by using weak atomic transitions, resonance laser\nionization spectroscopy is achieved with the required high efficiency (1-10%)\nand precision (linewidths of tens of MHz). We illustrate experimentally and\nthrough the use of simulations how the narrow experimental linewidths are\nachieved and how distorted resonance ionization spec- troscopy lineshapes can\nbe avoided. The role of the delay of the ionization laser pulse with respect to\nthe excitation laser pulse is crucial: the use of a delayed ionization step\npermits the best resolving powers and lineshapes. A high efficiency is\nmaintained if the intermediate level has a lifetime that is at least of the\norder of the excitation laser pulse width. A model that describes this process\nre- produces well the observed features and will help to optimize the\nconditions for future experiments.\n", "  It is believed that not all quantum systems can be simulated efficiently\nusing classical computational resources. This notion is supported by the fact\nthat in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for a large number of important\nproblems it is not known how to express the partition function in a sign-free\nmanner. The answer to the question --- whether there is an fundamental\nobstruction to such a sign-free representation in generic quantum systems ---\nremains unclear. Here, focussing on systems with bosonic degrees of freedom, we\nshow that quantized gravitational responses appear as obstructions to local\nsign-free QMC. In condensed matter physics settings these responses, such as\nthermal Hall conductance, are associated with fractional quantum Hall effects.\nWe show that similar arguments hold also in the case of spontaneously broken\ntime-reversal (TR) symmetry such as in the chiral phase of a perturbed quantum\nKagome antiferromagnet. The connection between quantized gravitational\nresponses and the sign problem is also clearly manifested in certain vertex\nmodels, where TR symmetry is preserved.\n", "  We consider a product of two finite order quantum $SU(2)$-gates $U_1$, $U_2$\nand ask when $U_1\\cdot U_2$ has an infinite order. Using the fact that $SU(2)$\nis a double cover of $SO(3)$ we actually study the product\n$O(\\gamma,\\vec{k}_{12})$ of two rotations $O(\\phi,\\vec{k}_1)\\in SO(3)$ and\n$O(\\phi,\\vec{k}_2)\\in SO(3)$ about axes $\\vec{k}_1$, $\\vec{k}_2\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^3$. In particular we focus on the case when\n$\\vec{k}_1\\cdot\\vec{k}_2=0$, and $\\phi_1=\\phi=\\phi_2$ are rational multiple of\n$\\pi$ and show that $\\gamma$ is not a rational multiple of $\\pi$ unless\n$\\phi\\in\\{\\frac{k\\pi}{2}:k\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$. The proof presented in this paper\nboils down to finding all pairs $\\gamma,\\phi\\in \\{a\\pi : a\\in\\mathbb{Q}\\}$ that\nare solutions of $\\cos\\frac{\\gamma}{2}=\\cos^2\\frac{\\phi}{2}$.\n", "  The goal of population spectral synthesis (PSS) is to decipher from the\nspectrum of a galaxy the mass, age and metallicity of its constituent stellar\npopulations. This technique has been established as a fundamental tool in\nextragalactic research. It has been extensively applied to large spectroscopic\ndata sets, notably the SDSS, leading to important insights into the galaxy\nassembly history. However, despite significant improvements over the past\ndecade, all current PSS codes suffer from two major deficiencies that inhibit\nus from gaining sharp insights into the star-formation history (SFH) of\ngalaxies and potentially introduce substantial biases in studies of their\nphysical properties (e.g., stellar mass, mass-weighted stellar age and specific\nstar formation rate). These are i) the neglect of nebular emission in spectral\nfits, consequently, ii) the lack of a mechanism that ensures consistency\nbetween the best-fitting SFH and the observed nebular emission characteristics\nof a star-forming (SF) galaxy. In this article, we present FADO (Fitting\nAnalysis using Differential evolution Optimization): a conceptually novel,\npublicly available PSS tool with the distinctive capability of permitting\nidentification of the SFH that reproduces the observed nebular characteristics\nof a SF galaxy. This so-far unique self-consistency concept allows us to\nsignificantly alleviate degeneracies in current spectral synthesis. The\ninnovative character of FADO is further augmented by its mathematical\nfoundation: FADO is the first PSS code employing genetic differential evolution\noptimization. This, in conjunction with other unique elements in its\nmathematical concept (e.g., optimization of the spectral library using\nartificial intelligence, convergence test, quasi-parallelization) results in\nkey improvements with respect to computational efficiency and uniqueness of the\nbest-fitting SFHs.\n", "  Quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) computing schemes use arrays of quantum\ndots as computational devices. Typically, these operate ideally by maintaining\narrays in their ground state to ensure correct computational output. For large\nQCA circuits, thermal fluctuations make this impossible, so adiabatic clocking\nhas been proposed as a means of dividing large circuit computations into\nsubcircuit computations that are more reliable. In this report, it is shown\nthat wires and inverters can transmit information correctly via their excited\nstates just as well as their ground states. A characteristic example of a 4\ncell wire is simulated, and a theoretical derivation of this result is given.\nWhen, non-nearest neighbor interactions are included in the Hamiltonian, this\nresult still holds true. On the other hand, QCA majority gates and more complex\ncircuits give incorrect results when operated in excited states. These results\nsuggest that gates of reliable QCA circuits should be contained in smaller\nclocking zones, while wires relaying information can be contained in larger\nclocking zones.\n", "  Degree ssortativity is the tendency for nodes of high degree (resp.low\ndegree) in a graph to be connected to high degree nodes (resp. to low degree\nones). It is sually quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient of the\ndegree-degree correlation. Here we extend this concept to account for the\neffect of second neighbours to a given node in a graph. That is, we consider\nthe two-walks degree of a node as the sum of all the degrees of its adjacent\nnodes. The two-walks degree assortativity of a graph is then the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient of the two-walks degree-degree correlation. We found\nhere analytical expression for this two-walks degree assortativity index as a\nfunction of contributing subgraphs. We then study all the 261,000 connected\ngraphs with 9 nodes and observe the existence of assortative-assortative and\ndisassortative-disassortative graphs according to degree and two-walks degree,\nrespectively. More surprinsingly, we observe a class of graphs which are degree\ndisassortative and two-walks degree assortative. We explain the existence of\nsome of these graphs due to the presence of certain topological features, such\nas a node of low-degree connected to high-degree ones. More importantly, we\nstudy a series of 49 real-world networks, where we observe the existence of the\ndisassortative-assortative class in several of them. In particular, all\nbiological networks studied here were in this class. We also conclude that no\ngraphs/networks are possible with assortative-disassortative structure.\n", "  A complete account of correlations has been shown to make $\\delta$-like\nrepulsive interaction potentials inefficient for any $N$-particle quantum\nsystem in the $D$-dimensional space with $D\\geq2$.\n", "  In a recent publication [Appl. Opt. 55, 2418 (2016)], a method for\ntwo-dimensional phase unwrapping based on the transport of intensity equation\n(TIE) was studied. We wish to show that this approach is associated with the\nstandard least squares phase unwrapping algorithm, but with additional\nnumerical errors.\n", "  GaAs was central to the development of quantum devices but is rarely used for\nnanowire-based quantum devices with InAs, InSb and SiGe instead taking the\nleading role. p-type GaAs nanowires offer a path to studying strongly-confined\n0D and 1D hole systems with strong spin-orbit effects, motivating our\ndevelopment of nanowire transistors featuring Be-doped p-type GaAs nanowires,\nAuBe alloy contacts and patterned local gate electrodes towards making\nnanowire-based quantum hole devices. We report on nanowire transistors with\ntraditional substrate back-gates and EBL-defined metal/oxide top-gates produced\nusing GaAs nanowires with three different Be-doping densities and various AuBe\ncontact processing recipes. We show that contact annealing only brings small\nimprovements for the moderately-doped devices under conditions of lower anneal\ntemperature and short anneal time. We only obtain good transistor performance\nfor moderate doping, with conduction freezing out at low temperature for\nlowly-doped nanowires and inability to reach a clear off-state under gating for\nthe highly-doped nanowires. Our best devices give on-state conductivity 95 nS,\noff-state conductivity 2 pS, on-off ratio ~$10^{4}$, and sub-threshold slope 50\nmV/dec at T = 4 K. Lastly, we made a device featuring a moderately-doped\nnanowire with annealed contacts and multiple top-gates. Top-gate sweeps show a\nplateau in the sub-threshold region that is reproducible in separate cool-downs\nand indicative of possible conductance quantization highlighting the potential\nfor future quantum device studies in this material system.\n", "  A method for classifying orbits near asteroids under a polyhedral\ngravitational field is presented, and may serve as a valuable reference for\nspacecraft orbit design for asteroid exploration. The orbital dynamics near\nasteroids are very complex. According to the variation in orbit characteristics\nafter being affected by gravitational perturbation during the periapsis\npassage, orbits near an asteroid can be classified into 9 categories: (1)\nsurroundingto-surrounding, (2) surrounding-to-surface, (3)\nsurroundingto-infinity, (4) infinity-to-infinity, (5) infinity-to-surface, (6)\ninfinity-to-surrounding, (7) surface-to-surface, (8) surfaceto-surrounding, and\n(9) surface-to- infinity. Assume that the orbital elements are constant near\nthe periapsis, the gravitation potential is expanded into a harmonic series.\nThen, the influence of the gravitational perturbation on the orbit is studied\nanalytically. The styles of orbits are dependent on the argument of periapsis,\nthe periapsis radius, and the periapsis velocity. Given the argument of\nperiapsis, the orbital energy before and after perturbation can be derived\naccording to the periapsis radius and the periapsis velocity. Simulations have\nbeen performed for orbits in the gravitational field of 216 Kleopatra. The\nnumerical results are well consistent with analytic predictions.\n", "  We report on the ab initio discovery of a novel putative ground state for\nquasi two-dimensional TiO$_2$ through a structural search using the minima\nhopping method with an artificial neural network potential. The structure is\nbased on a honeycomb lattice and is energetically lower than the experimentally\nreported lepidocrocite sheet by 7~meV/atom, and merely 13~meV/atom higher in\nenergy than the ground state rutile bulk structure. According to our\ncalculations, the hexagonal sheet is stable against mechanical stress, it is\nchemically inert and can be deposited on various substrates without disrupting\nthe structure. Its properties differ significantly from all known TiO$_2$ bulk\nphases with a large gap of 5.05~eV that can be tuned through strain\nengineering.\n", "  In order to pursue high-precision beam position measurements for the\nfree-electron laser (FEL) facilities, cavity beam position monitor (CBPM) is\nemployed to measure the transverse position which can meet the requirement of\nposition resolution with a sub-micrometer or even nanometer scale. But for the\npill-box cavity BPM, the possible existed crosstalk between the cavities will\nhave effects on the accurate measurement of beam position. Two methods, the\nprinciple component analysis (PCA) method and the method of harmonic analysis,\nare proposed in this paper to evaluate the crosstalk based on the experiment\ndates from the low quality CBPM prototype in Shanghai Deep ultraviolet free\nelectron laser (SDUV-FEL) facility and high quality CBPM in Dalian Coherent\nLight Source (DCLS), respectively. The results demonstrated that these two\nmethods are feasible in evaluating the crosstalk between the cavities.\n", "  Based on the relative entropy, we give a unified characterization of quantum\ncorrelations for nonlocality, steerability, discord and entanglement for any\nbipartite quantum states. For two-qubit states we show that the quantities\nobtained from quantifying nonlocality, steerability, entanglement and discord\nhave strictly monotonic relationship. As for examples, the Bell diagonal states\nare studied in detail.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a new property of two-dimensional integrable\nsystems -- existence of infinitely many local three-dimensional conservation\nlaws for pairs of integrable two-dimensional commuting flows. Infinitely many\nthree-dimensional local conservation laws for the Korteweg de Vries pair of\ncommuting flows and for the Benney commuting hydrodynamic chains are\nconstructed. As a by-product we established a new method for computation of\nlocal conservation laws for three-dimensional integrable systems. The Mikhalev\nequation and the dispersionless limit of the Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation\nare investigated. All known local and infinitely many new quasi-local\nthree-dimensional conservation laws are presented. Also four-dimensional\nconservation laws are considered for couples of three-dimensional integrable\nquasilinear systems and for triples of corresponding hydrodynamic chains.\n", "  While propagating in transparent media, near-infrared multi-terawatt (TW)\nlaser beams break up in a multitude of filaments of typically 100-200 um\ndiameter with peak intensities as high as 10 to 100~TW/cm$^{2}$. We observe a\nphase transition at incident beam intensities of 0.4~TW/cm$^2$, where the\ninteraction between filaments induce solid-like 2-dimensional crystals with a\n2.7 mm lattice constant, independent of the initial beam diameter. Below\n0.4~TW/cm$^2$, we evidence a mixed phase state in which some filaments are\nclosely packed in localized clusters, nucleated on inhomogeneities (seeds) in\nthe transverse intensity profile of the beam, and other are sparse with almost\nno interaction with their neighbors, similar to a gas. This analogy with a\nthermodynamic gas-solid phase transition is confirmed by calculating the\ninteraction Hamiltonian between neighboring filaments, which takes into account\nthe effect of diffraction, Kerr self-focusing and plasma generation. The shape\nof the effective potential is close to a Morse potential with an equilibrium\nbond length close to the observed value.\n", "  A nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with variable coefficients for surface\nwaves on a large-scale steady nonuniform current has been derived without the\nassumption of a relative smallness of the velocity of the current. This\nequation can describe with good accuracy the loss of modulation stability of a\nwave coming to a counter current, leading to the formation of so called rogue\nwaves. Some theoretical estimates are compared to the numerical simulation with\nthe exact equations for a two-dimensional potential motion of an ideal fluid\nwith a free boundary over a nonuniform bottom at a nonzero average horizontal\nvelocity.\n", "  The lack of evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life, even the\nsimplest forms of animal life, makes it is difficult to decide whether the\nsearch for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is more a high-risk,\nhigh-payoff endeavor than a futile attempt. Here we insist that even if\nextraterrestrial civilizations do exist and communicate, the likelihood of\ndetecting their signals crucially depends on whether the Earth lies within a\nregion of the galaxy covered by such signals. By considering possible\npopulations of independent emitters in the galaxy, we build a statistical model\nof the domain covered by hypothetical extraterrestrial signals to derive the\ndetection probability that the Earth is within such a domain. We show that for\ngeneral distributions of the signal longevity and directionality, the mean\nnumber of detectable emitters is less than one even for detection probabilities\nas large as 50\\%, regardless of the number of emitters in the galaxy.\n", "  In this study the effect of parallel and random-sequential updates on the\ndynamical properties of flocks in one dimension is considered. It is found that\nthe frequency of directional switching is increased for random-sequential\nupdates as compared to a parallel update. The nature of disorder to order\ntransition is also affected by the difference of updating mechanism:\ndiscontinuous for parallel and continuous for random-sequential updates.\n", "  The defect relaxation volumes obtained from density-functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations of charged vacancies and interstitials are much larger than their\nneutral counterparts, seemingly unphysically large. In this work, we\ninvestigate the possible reasons for this and revisit the methods that address\nthe calculation of charged defect structures in periodic DFT. We probe the\ndependence of the proposed energy corrections to charged defect formation\nenergies on relaxation volumes and find that corrections such as the image\ncharge correction and the alignment correction, which can lead to sizable\nchanges in defect formation energies, have an almost negligible effect on the\ncharged defect relaxation volume. We also investigate the volume for the net\nneutral defect reactions comprised of individual charged defects, and find that\nthe aggregate formation volumes have reasonable magnitudes. This work\nhighlights an important issue that, as for defect formation energies, the\ndefect formation volumes depend on the choice of reservoir. We show that\nconsidering the change in volume of the electron reservoir in the formation\nreaction of the charged defects, analogous to how volumes of atoms are\naccounted for in defect formation volumes, can renormalize the formation\nvolumes of charged defects such that they are comparable to neutral defects.\nThis approach enables the description of the elastic properties of isolated\ncharged defects within the overall neutral material, beyond the context of the\noverall defect reactions that produce the charged defect.\n", "  The stability and topological structure of equilibrium points in the\npotential field of the asteroid 101955 Bennu have been investigated with a\nvariable density and rotation period. A dimensionless quantity is introduced\nfor the nondimensionalization of the equations of motion, and this quantity can\nindicate the effect of both the rotation period and bulk density of the\nasteroid. Using the polyhedral model of the asteroid Bennu, the number and\nposition of the equilibrium points are calculated and illustrated by a contour\nplot of the gravitational effective potential field. The topological structure\nand the stability of the equilibrium points are also investigated using the\nlinearized method. The results show that there are nine equilibrium points in\nthe potential field of the asteroid Bennu, eight in the exterior of the body\nand one in the interior of the body. Moreover, bifurcation will occur with a\nvariation of the density and rotation period. Different equilibrium points will\nencounter each other and mix together. Thus, the number of equilibrium points\nwill change. The stability and topological structure of the equilibrium points\nwill also change because of the variation of the density and rotation period of\nthe asteroid. When considering the error of the density of Bennu, the range of\nthe dimensionless quantity covers the critical values that will lead to\nbifurcation. This means that the stability of the equilibrium points is\nuncertain, making the dynamical environment of Bennu much more complicated.\nThese bifurcations can help better understand the dynamic environment of an\nirregular-shaped asteroid.\n", "  A simple transformation of field variables eliminates Coulomb forces from the\ntheory of quantum electrodynamics. This suggests that Coulomb forces may be an\nemergent phenomenon rather than being fundamental. This possibility is\ninvestigated in the context of reducible quantum electrodynamics. It is shown\nthat states exist which bind free photon and free electron fields. The binding\nenergy peaks in the long-wavelength limit. This makes it plausible that Coulomb\nforces result from the interaction of the electron/positron field with\nlong-wavelength transversely polarized photons.\n", "  Time-spectral solution of ordinary and partial differential equations is\noften regarded as an inefficient approach. The associated extension of the time\ndomain, as compared to finite difference methods, is believed to result in\nuncomfortably many numerical operations and high memory requirements. It is\nshown in this work that performance is substantially enhanced by the\nintroduction of algorithms for temporal and spatial subdomains in combination\nwith sparse matrix methods. The accuracy and efficiency of the recently\ndeveloped time spectral, generalized weighted residual method (GWRM) is\ncompared to that of the explicit Lax-Wendroff method and the implicit\nCrank-Nicolson method. Three initial-value PDEs are employed as model problems;\nthe 1D Burger equation, a forced 1D wave equation and a coupled system of 14\nlinearized ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. It is found that the GWRM\nis more efficient than the time-stepping methods at high accuracies. For\ntime-averaged solution of the two-time-scales, forced wave equation GWRM\nperformance exceeds the finite difference methods by an order of magnitude both\nin terms of CPU time and memory requirement. Favourable scaling of CPU time and\nmemory usage with the number of temporal and spatial subdomains is demonstrated\nfor the MHD equations.\n", "  The Semi-Implicit Root solver (SIR) is an iterative method for globally\nconvergent solution of systems of nonlinear equations. Since publication, SIR\nhas proven robustness for a great variety of problems. We here present MATLAB\nand MAPLE codes for SIR, that can be easily implemented in any application\nwhere linear or nonlinear systems of equations need be solved efficiently. The\ncodes employ recently developed efficient sparse matrix algorithms and improved\nnumerical differentiation. SIR convergence is quasi-monotonous and approaches\nsecond order in the proximity of the real roots. Global convergence is usually\nsuperior to that of Newtons method, being a special case of the method.\nFurthermore the algorithm cannot land on local minima, as may be the case for\nNewtons method with linesearch.\n", "  One of the most challenging and recurring problems when modelling plasmas is\nthe lack of data on key atomic and molecular reactions that drive plasma\nprocesses. Even when there are data for some reactions, complete and validated\ndatasets of chemistries are rarely available. This hinders research on plasma\nprocesses and curbs development of industrial applications. The QDB project\naims to address this problem by providing a platform for provision, exchange,\nand validation of chemistry datasets. A new data model developed for QDB is\npresented. QDB collates published data on both electron scattering and\nheavy-particle reactions. These data are formed into reaction sets, which are\nthen validated against experimental data where possible. This process produces\nboth complete chemistry sets and identifies key reactions that are currently\nunreported in the literature. Gaps in the datasets can be filled using\nestablished theoretical methods. Initial validated chemistry sets for\nSF$_6$/CF$_4$/O$_2$ and SF$_6$/CF$_4$/N$_2$/H$_2$ are presented as examples.\n", "  High-speed stereo PIV-measurements have been performed in a turbulent\nboundary layer at Re$_{\\theta}$ of 9800 in order to elucidate the coherent\nstructures. Snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode\ndecomposition (DMD) are used to visualize the flow structure depending on the\nturbulent kinetic energy and frequency content. The first six POD and DMD modes\nshow the largest and the lowest amount of energy and frequency, respectively.\nLagrangian coherent structure (LCS) based on the algorithm developed using the\nvariational theory is also applied to track the flow via attracting and\nrepelling trajectories. The shapes and the length of the trajectories show\nvariation with increasing advection time. LCS trajectories are overlayed with\nthe individual POD and DMD modes. Repelling and attracting lines cover the\nstructure of these modes. Reconstructed flow fields from individual POD modes\nare also used to generate new LCS trajectories. The energy and frequency\ncontent have a direct impact on the length of the trajectories, where the\nlongest reconstructed trajectories associate with the higher energy and lower\nfrequency modes, and vise verse. The multiple intersection points between the\nrepelling and attracting lines marked the low momentum regions.\n", "  The elemental Nb is mainly investigated for its eminent superconducting\nproperties. In contrary, we report of a relatively unexplored property, namely,\nits superior optoelectronic property in reduced dimension. We demonstrate here\nthat nanostructured Nb thin films (NNFs), under optical illumination, behave as\nroom temperature photo-switches and exhibit bolometric features below its\nsuperconducting critical temperature. Both photo-switch and superconducting\nbolometric behavior are monitored by its resistance change with light in\nvisible and near infrared (NIR) wavelength range. Unlike the conventional\nphotodetectors, the NNF devices switch to higher resistive states with light\nand the corresponding resistivity change is studied with thickness and grain\nsize variations. At low temperature in its superconducting state, the light\nexposure shifts the superconducting transition towards lower temperature. The\nroom temperature photon sensing nature of the NNF is explained by the photon\nassisted electron-phonon scattering mechanism while the low temperature light\nresponse is mainly related to the heat generation which essentially changes the\neffective temperature for the device and the device is capable of sensing a\ntemperature difference of few tens of milli-kelvins. The observed\nphoto-response on the transport properties of NNFs can be very important for\nfuture superconducting photon detectors, bolometers and phase slip based device\napplications.\n", "  Capillary forces acting at the surface of a liquid drop can be strong enough\nto deform small objects and recent studies have provided several examples of\nelastic instabilities induced by surface tension. We present such an example\nwhere a liquid drop sits on a straight fiber, and we show that the liquid\nattracts the fiber which thereby coils inside the drop. We derive the\nequilibrium equations for the system, compute bifurcation curves, and show the\npacked fiber may adopt several possible configurations inside the drop. We use\nthe energy of the system to discriminate between the different configurations\nand find a intermittent regime between two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nsolutions as more and more fiber is driven inside the drop.\n", "  H$_3^+$ is a ubiquitous and important astronomical species whose spectrum has\nbeen observed in the interstellar medium, planets and tentatively in the\nremnants of supernova SN1897a. Its role as a cooler is important for gas giant\nplanets and exoplanets, and possibly the early Universe. All this makes the\nspectral properties, cooling function and partition function of H$_3^+$ key\nparameters for astronomical models and analysis. A new high-accuracy, very\nextensive line list for H$_3^+$ called MiZATeP was computed as part of the\nExoMol project alongside a temperature-dependent cooling function and partition\nfunction as well as lifetimes for %individual excited states. These data are\nmade available in electronic form as supplementary data to this article and at\nhttp://www.exomol.com\n", "  In this paper, we study fractional order heat equation in higher space-time\ndimensions and offer specific role of heat flows in various fractional\ndimensions. We offer fractional solutions of the heat equations thus obtained,\nand examine the associated implications in various limiting cases. We\nanticipate perspective applications of fractional heat flow solutions in\nphysical systems.\n", "  The status of the experimental determination of $V_{us}$ from $K_{\\ell3}$ and\n$K_{\\mu2}$ decays is reviewed. Factors currently limiting the precision of the\nevaluation of $V_{us}$ from kaon decays and prospects for new measurements\nwithin the next few years are discussed.\n", "  The Dirac equation requires a treatment of the step potential that differs\nfundamentally from the traditional treatment, because the Dirac plane waves,\nbesides momentum and spin, are characterized by a quantum number with the\nphysical meaning of sign of charge. Since the Hermitean operator corresponding\nto this quantum number does not commute with the step potential, the time\ndisplacement parameter used in the ansatz of the stationary state does not have\nthe physical meaning of energy. Therefore there are no paradoxal values of the\nenergy. The new solution of the Dirac equation with a step potential is\nobtained. This solution, again, allows for phenomena of the Klein paradox type,\nbut in addition it contains a positron amplitude localized at the threshold\npoint of the step potential.\n", "  We show that the peculiarities of the electron band structure strongly affect\nthe spin-valve effect in heterostructures consisting of a superconductor (S)\nand two ferromagnetic layers F1 and F2. For the S/F1/F2 systems the energy\nshift between the electron bands in the S and F2 layers determines wether the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ of the superconductor increases or decreases as a\nfunction of the angle $\\theta$ between the magnetic moments in the\nferromagnets. In the case of half-metallic F2 layer the type of the spin-valve\neffect becomes dependent on the position of the only occupied spin-band and the\nminimum of $T_c$ may correspond to the anti-parallel, parallel or non-collinear\norientations of magnetic moments. Also, for the first time, we analytically\ndemonstrate the possibility of the triplet spin-valve effect in the\nF/S/half-metal structures.\n", "  Advantage is taken of a complete and precise experimental study of the\nluminescent properties of yttrium aluminium garnet doped with Ce, previously\naccomplished by other authors, to confirm the accuracy of the invoked\ntheoretical methods for dealing with the realistic calculation of the\nelectromagnetic spectra of condensed phases. The fluorescent spectra at T=0 and\nT=250 K of YAG:Ce(3+) were calculated with no adjustable parameter, giving\ncomplete agreement with experiment. The energy released by the electronic\ntransitions was determined with precision better than 5\\% the full width at\nhalf maximum of the spectral features. Thermal quenching of the fluorescent\nyield is discussed and calculated in a less accurate way, but anyway showing\ngood agreement with experiment.\n", "  This is a comment on arXiv:1611.04445 (PRL, 118, 114801 (2017)). It is\npointed out that the fundamental problems in light beam vortices and the\nrelativistic electron vortices are not identical and have subtle differences.\nThe significance of two length scales is underlined for the electron vortices.\nLocal gauge transformation on the Gordon current admits vortex structure.\n", "  A simple and low cost apparatus has been designed and built to measure the\nelectrical resistivity, ($\\rho$), of metal and semiconductors in 300-620 K\ntemperature range. The present design is suitable to do measurement on\nrectangular bar sample by using conventional four-probe dc method. A small\nheater is made on the sample mounting copper block to achieve the desired\ntemperature. Heat loss from sample holder is minimize by using very low thermal\nconductive insulator block. This unique design of heater and minimized heat\nloss from sample platform provide uniform sample temperature and also have very\ngood thermal stability during the measurement. The electrical contacts of\ncurrent leads and potential probes on the sample are done by using very thin\n(42 SWG) copper wires and high temperature silver paste. The use of limited\ncomponents and small heater design make present instrument very simple, light\nweight, easy to sample mount, small in size, and low cost. To calibrate the\ninstrument pure nickel sample was used, and two other materials\nLa$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) and LaCoO$_{3}$ (LCO) were also\ncharacterized to demonstrate the accuracy of this set-up. $\\rho$(T) behavior on\nthese samples were found to be in good agreement with the reported data. The\nmetal-insulator transition for LSMO (T$_{MI}$ = $\\sim$358 K) and the\ninsulator-metal transition for LCO (T$_{IM}$ = $\\sim$540 K) were clearly\nobserved and these transitions temperature were also consistent with those\nreported in literature.\n", "  We show that Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the interface between a\nsuperconductor and a ferromagnet should produce a spontaneous current in the\natomic thickness region near the interface. This current is counter-balanced by\nthe superconducting screening current flowing in the region of the width of the\nLondon penetration depth near the interface. Such current carrying state\ncreates a magnetic field near the superconductor surface, generates a stray\nmagnetic field outside the sample edges, changes the slope of the temperature\ndependence of the critical field $H_{c3}$ and may generate the spontaneous\nAbrikosov vortices near the interface.\n", "  High-energy astrophysical events that cause galaxy-scale extinctions have\nbeen proposed as a way to explain or mollify the Fermi Paradox, by making the\nuniverse at earlier times more dangerous for evolving life, and reducing its\npresent-day prevalence. Here, we present an anthropic argument that a more\ndangerous early universe can have the opposite effect, actually increasing\nestimates for the amount of visible extragalactic life at the present cosmic\ntime. This occurs when civilizations are assumed to expand and displace\npossible origination sites for the evolution of life, and estimates are made by\nassuming that humanity has appeared at a typical time. The effect is not seen\nif advanced life is assumed to always remain stationary, with no displacement\nof habitable worlds.\n", "  This brief article reviews a recently proposed scenario of moduli\nstabilization constructed in the vicinity of a conifold locus in the complex\nstructure moduli space. We discuss typical features of moduli stabilization due\nto the logarithmic structure of the periods over the Calabi-Yau threefold.\nIntegrating out heavy moduli implies exponential terms in the superpotential\nvery reminiscent of non-perturbative contributions. Ultimately, these terms can\nlead to an alignment of axions potentially realizing large-field inflation. Our\ngoal is to investigate common issues appearing for moduli stabilization near\nthe conifold and subsequent applications to string cosmology. Even though this\nsetup needs to be understood as a toy model, a closer look at the validity of\nthe effective theories reveals characteristic obstacles, which are likely to\noccur in more serious scenarios as well.\n", "  In these lecture notes we give an introduction to the kinetic equation\napproach to pair production form the vacuum in strong, time-dependent external\nfields (dynamical Schwinger process). We first give a derivation of the kinetic\nequation with the source term for the case of fermions starting from the Dirac\nequation and for bosons from the Klein-Gordon equation. In a second part we\ndiscuss the application of the approach to the situation of external field\npulses as single-sheeted functions of time (like the Sauter-pulse) and as\nmulti- sheeted functions approximating the situation in the focal point of\ncounter-propagating laser beams. Special emphasis is on the discussion of the\ntime evolution of the system that exhibits the characteristics of a\nfield-induced phase transition for which we discuss the behaviour of the\nentropy and particle density of the system. We give an outlook to applications\nof the approach in describing particle production in strong fields formed in\nparticle and nuclear collisions.\n", "  Consider random linear estimation with Gaussian measurement matrices and\nnoise. One can compute infinitesimal variations of the mutual information under\ninfinitesimal variations of the signal-to-noise ratio or of the measurement\nrate. We discuss how each variation is related to the minimum mean-square error\nand deduce that the two variations are directly connected through a very simple\nidentity. The main technical ingredient is a new interpolation method called\n\"sub-extensive interpolation method\". We use it to provide a new proof of an\nI-MMSE relation recently found by Reeves and Pfister [1] when the measurement\nrate is varied. Our proof makes it clear that this relation is intimately\nrelated to another I-MMSE relation also recently proved in [2]. One can\ndirectly verify that the identity relating the two types of variation of mutual\ninformation is indeed consistent with the one letter replica symmetric formula\nfor the mutual information, first derived by Tanaka [3] for binary signals, and\nrecently proved in more generality in [1,2,4,5] (by independent methods).\nHowever our proof is independent of any knowledge of Tanaka's formula.\n", "  The asymptotic attractors of a nonlinear dynamical system play a key role in\nthe long-term physically observable behaviors of the system. The study of\nattractors and the search for distinct types of attractor have been a central\ntask in nonlinear dynamics. In smooth dynamical systems, an attractor is often\nenclosed completely in its basin of attraction with a finite distance from the\nbasin boundary. Recent works have uncovered that, in neuronal networks,\nunstable attractors with a remote basin can arise, where almost every point on\nthe attractor is locally transversely repelling. Herewith we report our\ndiscovery of a class of attractors: partially unstable attractors, in\npulse-coupled integrate-and-fire networks subject to a periodic forcing. The\ndefining feature of such an attractor is that it can simultaneously possess\nlocally stable and unstable sets, both of positive measure. Exploiting the\nstructure of the key dynamical events in the network, we develop a symbolic\nanalysis that can fully explain the emergence of the partially unstable\nattractors. To our knowledge, such exotic attractors have not been reported\npreviously, and we expect them to arise commonly in biological networks whose\ndynamics are governed by pulse (or spike) generation.\n", "  I present the first analytical study of gravitational collapse in a compact\nCMC foliation with $S^3$ spatial topology. The solutions I find, in this\ncontext, will be both solutions of Shape Dynamics and General Relativity. The\naim is to describe a system undergoing gravitational collapse in Shape\nDynamics, so a well-justified and useful simplification is to assume spherical\nsymmetry. This kills all the local gravitational degrees of freedom, but some\nnontrivial degrees of freedom are recovered by introducing matter. The simplest\nform of matter is infinitely thin spherical shells of dust, of which I need at\nleast two in order to have a nontrivial dynamics. With a single shell the\nsystem is dynamically trivial, but it nevertheless admits a solution which\nrepresents a `frozen' shell at equilibrium in a globally de Sitter universe.\nSuch a solution is, to my knowledge, new. I am able to solve analytically also\nthe case with two shells, which has a nontrivial dynamics. When the rest mass\nof one shell is much smaller than the other, the system is suitable to model a\ncompact universe in which one subsystem (the `light' shell) undergoes\ngravitational collapse while the rest of the matter (the `heavy' shell) plays\nthe role of spectator. It turns out that, if the cosmological constant is zero\nor positive but small, and the rest mass of the two shells are sufficiently\ndifferent, when the `light' shells collapses the ADM equations become\nill-defined and cease to admit a solution. The shape-dynamical description,\nhowever, seems still well defined and can be continued past this point,\npossibly signalling a departure of Shape Dynamics from exact equivalence with\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  Layered materials have huge potential in various applications due to their\nextraordinary properties. To determine the interlayer interaction (or\nequivalently the layer spacing under different perturbations) is of critical\nimportance. In this letter, we focus on one of the most prominent layered\nmaterials, graphite, and theoretically quantify the relationship between its\ninterlayer spacing and the vibrational frequencies of its layer breathing and\nshear modes, which are measures of the interlayer interaction. The method used\nhere to determine the interlayer interaction can be further applied to other\nlayered materials.\n"]}
