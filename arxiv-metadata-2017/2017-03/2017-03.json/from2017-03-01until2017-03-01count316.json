equations, for a zero shift vector,\narise naturally from the equations for the second variation of arc-length.\n", "  Collapse theories are versions of quantum mechanics according to which the\ncollapse of the wave function is a real physical process. They propose precise\nmathematical laws to govern this process and to replace the vague conventional\nprescription that a collapse occurs whenever an \"observer\" makes a\n\"measurement.\" The \"primitive ontology\" of a theory (more or less what Bell\ncalled the \"local beables\") are the variables in the theory that represent\nmatter in space-time. There is no consensus about whether collapse theories\nneed to introduce a primitive ontology as part of their definition. I make some\nremarks on this question and point out that certain paradoxes about collapse\ntheories are absent if a primitive ontology is introduced.\n", "  In this paper, all the known classical solutions of plane perfect plasticity\nsystem under Saint Venant -- Tresca -- von Mises yield criterion are associated\nwith some group of point symmetries. The equations of slip-line families for\nall solutions are constructed, which permits to determine explicitly boundaries\nof plastic areas.\n  It is shown, how one can determine the compatible velocity solution for known\nstresses, considering symmetries. Some invariant solutions of velocities for\nPrandtl stresses are constructed. The mechanical sense of obtained velocity\nfields is discussed.\n", "  We equip the space of lattice cones with a coproduct which makes it a\nconnected cograded colagebra. The exponential sum and exponential integral on\nlattice cones can be viewed as linear maps on this space with values in the\nspace of meromorphic germs with linear poles at zero. We investigate the\nsubdivision properties-- reminiscent of the inclusion-exclusion principle for\nthe cardinal on finite sets-- of such linear maps and establish a compatibility\nof these properties with respect to the convolution quotient of the coalgebra.\nImplementing the Algebraic Birkhoff Factorization procedure on the linear maps\nunder consideration, we factorize the exponential sum as a convolution quotient\nof two maps, with each of the maps in the factorization satisfying a\nsubdivision property. Consequently, the Algebraic Birkhoff Factorization\nspecializes to the Euler-Maclaurin formula on lattice cones and provides a\nsimple formula for the interpolating factor by means of a projection map.\n", "  The classical quantization of a family of a quadratic Li\\'{e}nard-type\nequation (Li\\'{e}nard II equation) is achieved by a quantization scheme (M.~C.\nNucci. {\\em Theor. Math. Phys.}, 168:994--1001, 2011) that preserves the\nNoether point symmetries of the underlying Lagrangian in order to construct the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. This method straightforwardly yields the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation as given in (A.~Ghose~Choudhury and Partha Guha. {\\em J. Phys. A:\nMath. Theor.}, 46:165202, 2013).\n", "  Silicon is an excellent material for microelectronics and integrated\nphotonics with untapped potential for mid-IR optics. Despite broad recognition\nof the importance of the third dimension, current lithography methods do not\nallow fabrication of photonic devices and functional microelements directly\ninside silicon chips. Even relatively simple curved geometries cannot be\nrealized with techniques like reactive ion etching. Embedded optical elements,\nlike in glass, electronic devices and better electronic-photonic integration\nare lacking. Here, we demonstrate laser-based fabrication of complex 3D\nstructures deep inside silicon using 1 micrometer-sized dots and rod-like\nstructures of adjustable length as basic building blocks. The laser-modified Si\nhas a different optical index than unmodified parts, which enables numerous\nphotonic devices. Optionally, these parts are chemically etched to produce\ndesired 3D shapes. We exemplify a plethora of subsurface, i.e., \"in-chip\"\nmicrostructures for microfluidic cooling of chips, vias, MEMS, photovoltaic\napplications and photonic devices that match or surpass the corresponding\nstate-of-the-art device performances.\n", "  We study the form factors of the Konishi operator, the prime example of\nnon-protected operators in N=4 SYM theory, via the on-shell unitarity methods.\nSince the Konishi operator is not protected by supersymmetry, its form factors\nshare many features with those in QCD, such as the occurrence of rational terms\nand of UV divergences that require renormalization. A subtle point is that this\noperator depends on the spacetime dimension. This requires a modification when\ncalculating its form factors via unitarity methods. We derive a rigorous\nprescription that implements this modification to all loop orders and obtain\nthe two-point form factor up to two-loop order and the three-point form factor\nto one-loop order. From these form factors, we construct an IR-finite cross\nsection type quantity, namely the inclusive decay rate of the (off-shell)\nKonishi operator to any final (on-shell) state. Via the optical theorem, it is\nconnected to the imaginary part of the two-point correlation function. We\nextract the Konishi anomalous dimension up to two-loop order from it.\n", "  It has long been suggested that solutions to linear scalar wave equation\n$$\\Box_g\\phi=0$$ on a fixed subextremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime with\nnon-vanishing charge are generically singular at the Cauchy horizon. We prove\nthat generic smooth and compactly supported initial data on a Cauchy\nhypersurface indeed give rise to solutions with infinite nondegenerate energy\nnear the Cauchy horizon in the interior of the black hole. In particular, the\nsolution generically does not belong to $W^{1,2}_{loc}$. This instability is\nrelated to the celebrated blue shift effect in the interior of the black hole.\nThe problem is motivated by the strong cosmic censorship conjecture and it is\nexpected that for the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell system, this instability\nleads to a singular Cauchy horizon for generic small perturbations of\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime. Moreover, in addition to the instability\nresult, we also show as a consequence of the proof that Price's law decay is\ngenerically sharp along the event horizon.\n", "  Under the normal assumptions of quantum field theory, Haag's theorem states\nthat any field unitarily equivalent to a free field must itself be a free\nfield. Unfortunately, the derivation of the Dyson series perturbation expansion\nrelies on the use of the interaction picture, in which the interacting field is\nunitarily equivalent to the free field but must still account for interactions.\nThus, the traditional perturbative derivation of the scattering matrix in\nquantum field theory is mathematically ill defined. Nevertheless, perturbative\nquantum field theory is currently the only practical approach for addressing\nscattering for realistic interactions, and it has been spectacularly successful\nin making empirical predictions. This paper explains this success by showing\nHaag's Theorem can be avoided when quantum field theory is formulated using an\ninvariant, fifth path parameter in addition to the usual four position\nparameters, such that the Dyson perturbation expansion for the scattering\nmatrix can still be reproduced. As a result, the parameterized formalism\nprovides a consistent foundation for the interpretation of quantum field theory\nas used in practice and, perhaps, for better dealing with other mathematical\nissues.\n", "  Structures of calcium peroxide (CaO2) are investigated in the pressure range\n0-200 GPa using the ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) method and\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations. At 0 GPa, there are several CaO2\nstructures very close in enthalpy, with the ground-state structure dependent on\nthe choice of exchange-correlation functional. Further stable structures for\nCaO2 with C2/c, I4/mcm and P21/c symmetries emerge at pressures below 40 GPa.\nThese phases are thermodynamically stable against decomposition into CaO and\nO2. The stability of CaO2 with respect to decomposition increases with\npressure, with peak stability occurring at the CaO B1-B2 phase transition at 65\nGPa. Phonon calculations using the quasiharmonic approximation show that CaO2\nis a stable oxide of calcium at mantle temperatures and pressures, highlighting\na possible role for CaO2 in planetary geochemistry. We sketch the phase diagram\nfor CaO2, and find at least five new stable phases in the pressure/temperature\nranges 0<P<60 GPa, 0<T<600 K, including two new candidates for the\nzero-pressure ground state structure.\n", "  We propose a new method for generating new Hamiltonians for the development\nof supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics for real as well as complex\nsystems.interestingly Hamiltonians which can be realised in this method, can\nhardly be derieved using all previous formalisms developed so far.Further\nexamples discussed here include both shape invariant and shape non-invariant\npotentials.We notice a new thing (which has not been revealed earlier) in the\ncase of shape invariant potentials i.e by suitable choice of parameters in\nsuperpotential the generated hamiltonians satisfy either (i) SUSY conditions\ni.e $E_{n}^{(+)} =E_{n+1}^{(-)}$ ; $E_{0}^{(-)}=0$ or (ii) Iso-spectral\ncondition i.e $E_{n}^{(+)}=E_{n}^{(-)}$ .However for non-shape invariant\npotentials energy relations depend only in the choice of superpotentials.We\npresent both analytical as well as numerical results. PACS :11.30.Pb, 03.65.Db,\n11.30.Er, 03.65.Ge Keywords - Superpotential, SUSY condition, Iso-spectral\ncondition, real Hamiltonian, complex Hamiltonian, exactly solvable systems,\nnumerical results.\n", "  In classical computational chemistry, the coupled-cluster ansatz is one of\nthe most commonly used $ab~initio$ methods, which is critically limited by its\nnon-unitary nature. The unitary modification as an ideal solution to the\nproblem is, however, extremely inefficient in classical conventional\ncomputation. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence that indeed the\nunitary version of the coupled cluster ansatz can be reliably performed in\nphysical quantum system, a trapped ion system. We perform a simulation on the\nelectronic structure of a molecular ion (HeH$^+$), where the ground-state\nenergy surface curve is probed, energies of excited-states are studied and the\nbond-dissociation is simulated non-perturbatively. Our simulation takes\nadvantages from quantum computation to overcome the intrinsic limitations in\nclassical computation and our experimental results indicate that the method is\npromising for preparing molecular ground-states for quantum simulation.\n", "  Spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) attracts\nextensive attentions due to its non-volatility, high density and low power\nconsumption. The core device in STT-MRAM is CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel\njunction (MTJ), which possesses a high tunnel magnetoresistance ratio as well\nas a large value of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). It has been\nexperimentally proven that a capping layer coating on CoFeB layer is essential\nto obtain a strong PMA. However, the physical mechanism of such effect remains\nunclear. In this paper, we investigate the origin of the PMA in\nMgO/CoFe/metallic capping layer structures by using a first-principles\ncomputation scheme. The trend of PMA variation with different capping materials\nagrees well with experimental results. We find that interfacial PMA in the\nthree-layer structures comes from both the MgO/CoFe and CoFe/capping layer\ninterfaces, which can be analyzed separately. Furthermore, the PMAs in the\nCoFe/capping layer interfaces are analyzed through resolving the magnetic\nanisotropy energy by layer and orbital. The variation of PMA with different\ncapping materials is attributed to the different hybridizations of both d and p\norbitals via spin-orbital coupling. This work can significantly benefit the\nresearch and development of nanoscale STT-MRAM.\n", "  Recent developments in string theory have revealed a surprising connection\nbetween spectral theory and local mirror symmetry: it has been found that the\nquantization of mirror curves to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds leads to trace\nclass operators, whose spectral properties are conjecturally encoded in the\nenumerative geometry of the Calabi-Yau. This leads to a new, infinite family of\nsolvable spectral problems: the Fredholm determinants of these operators can be\nfound explicitly in terms of Gromov-Witten invariants and their refinements;\ntheir spectrum is encoded in exact quantization conditions, and turns out to be\ndetermined by the vanishing of a quantum theta function. Conversely, the\nspectral theory of these operators provides a non-perturbative definition of\ntopological string theory on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. In particular, their\nintegral kernels lead to matrix integral representations of the topological\nstring partition function, which explain some number-theoretic properties of\nthe periods. In this paper we give a pedagogical overview of these developments\nwith a focus on their mathematical implications\n", "  Topological semimetals are gapless states of matter which have robust surface\nstates and interesting electromagnetic responses. In this paper, we consider\nthe electromagnetic response of gapless phases in $3+1$-dimensions with line\nnodes. We show through a layering approach that an intrinsic $2$-form\n${\\cal{B}}_{\\mu\\nu}$ emerges in the effective response field theory that is\ndetermined by the geometry and energy-embedding of the nodal lines. This 2-form\nis shown to be simply related to the charge polarization and orbital\nmagnetization of the sample. We conclude by discussing the relevance for\nrecently proposed materials and heterostructures with line-node fermi-surfaces.\n", "  Pauli's exclusion principle has a strong impact on the properties of most\nfermionic quantum systems. Remarkably, the fermionic exchange symmetry implies\nfurther constraints on the one-particle picture. By exploiting those\ngeneralized Pauli constraints we derive a measure which quantifies the\ninfluence of the exchange symmetry beyond Pauli's exclusion principle. It is\nbased on a geometric hierarchy induced by the exclusion principle constraints.\nWe provide a proof of principle by applying our measure to a simple model. In\nthat way, we conclusively confirm the physical relevance of the generalized\nPauli constraints and show that the fermionic exchange symmetry can have an\ninfluence on the one-particle picture beyond Pauli's exclusion principle. Our\nfindings provide a new perspective on fermionic multipartite correlation since\nour measure allows one to distinguish between static and dynamic correlations.\n", "  We study quantum gravity with the Einstein-Hilbert action including the\ncosmological constant on the Euclidean Einstein universe $S^1\\times S^3$. We\ncompute exactly the spectra and the heat kernels of the relevant operators on\n$S^3$ and use these results to compute the heat trace of the graviton and ghost\noperators and the exact one-loop effective action on $S^1\\times S^3$. We show\nthat the system is unstable in the infrared limit due to the presence of the\nnegative modes of the graviton and the ghost operators. We study the thermal\nproperties of the model with the temperature $T=(2\\pi a_1)^{-1}$ determined by\nthe radius $a_1$ of the circle $S^1$. We show that the heat capacity $C_v$ is\nwell defined and behaves like $\\sim T^3$ in the high temperature limit and has\na singularity of the type $\\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$, indicating a second-order phase\ntransition, with the critical temperature $T_c$ determined by the cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$ and the radius $a$ of the sphere $S^3$. We also discuss some\npeculiar properties of the model such as the negative heat capacity as well as\npossible physical applications.\n", "  In this paper we show how to compute algorithmically the full set of\nalgebraically independent constraints for singular mechanical and\nfield-theoretical models with polynomial Lagrangians. If a model under\nconsideration is not singular as a whole but has domains of dynamical (field)\nvariables where its Lagrangian becomes singular, then our approach allows to\ndetect such domains and compute the relevant constraints. In doing so, we\nassume that the Lagrangian of a model is a differential polynomial and apply\nthe differential Thomas decomposition algorithm to the Euler-Lagrange\nequations.\n", "  We study the partition of energy between waves and vortices in stratified\nturbulence, with or without rotation, for a variety of parameters, focusing on\nthe behavior of the waves and vortices in the inverse cascade of energy towards\nthe large scales. To this end, we use direct numerical simulations in a cubic\nbox at a Reynolds number Re=1000, with the ratio between the\nBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency N and the inertial frequency f varying from 1/4\nto 20, together with a purely stratified run. The Froude number, measuring the\nstrength of the stratification, varies within the range 0.02 < Fr < 0.32. We\nfind that the inverse cascade is dominated by the slow quasi-geostrophic modes.\nTheir energy spectra and fluxes exhibit characteristics of an inverse cascade,\neven though their energy is not conserved. Surprisingly, the slow vortices\nstill dominate when the ratio N/f increases, also in the stratified case,\nalthough less and less so. However, when N/f increases, the inverse cascade of\nthe slow modes becomes weaker and weaker, and it vanishes in the purely\nstratified case. We discuss how the disappearance of the inverse cascade of\nenergy with increasing N/f can be interpreted in terms of the waves and\nvortices, and identify three major effects that can explain this transition\nbased on inviscid invariants arguments.\n", "  Nuclear modification factor ($R_{cp}$) of protons and pions are investigated\nby simulating Au + Au collisions from 0.8 to 1.8$A$ GeV in a framework of an\nisospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model. $R_{cp}$ of protons\nrises with the increase of \\pt~ at different beam energies owing to radial flow\nand Cronin effect. The rate of increase of \\rcp~ is suppressed at higher beam\nenergies. The significant difference of $R_{cp}$ between protons and pions\nindicates different medium effects between protons and pions. By changing the\nin-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, the $R_{cp}$ of protons changes a lot,\nwhile the $R_{cp}$ of pions does not. Taking the pion absorption into account,\nthe $R_{cp}$ of pions becomes close to unity without $p_{T}$ dependence after\ndeactivating the reaction $\\pi N \\rightarrow \\Delta$, while there is nearly no\nchange on proton. This suggests that the pion absorption plays a dominant role\non pion dynamics and have slight effect for proton dynamics.\n", "  We consider a one dimensional spin $1/2$ chain with Heisenberg interaction in\na disordered parallel magnetic field. This system is known to exhibit the many\nbody localization (MBL) transition at critical strength of disorder. We analyze\nthe response of the chain when additional perpendicular magnetic field is\napplied to an individual spin and propose a method for accurate determination\nof the mobility edge via local spin measurements. We further demonstrate that\nthe exponential decrease of the spin response with the distance between\nperturbed spin and measured spin can be used to characterize the localization\nlength in the MBL phase.\n", "  The direct evaluation of manifestly optimal, cut-sky CMB power spectrum and\nbispectrum estimators is numerically very costly, due to the presence of\ninverse-covariance filtering operations. This justifies the investigation of\nalternative approaches. In this work, we mostly focus on an inpainting\nalgorithm that was introduced in recent CMB analyses to cure cut-sky\nsuboptimalities of bispectrum estimators. First, we show that inpainting can\nequally be applied to the problem of unbiased estimation of power spectra. We\nthen compare the performance of a novel inpainted CMB temperature power\nspectrum estimator to the popular apodised pseudo-$C_l$ (PCL) method and\ndemonstrate, both numerically and with analytic arguments, that inpainted power\nspectrum estimates significantly outperform PCL estimates. Finally, we study\nthe case of cut-sky bispectrum estimators, comparing the performance of three\ndifferent approaches: inpainting, apodisation and a novel low-l leaning scheme.\nProviding an analytic argument why the local shape is typically most affected\nwe mainly focus on local type non-Gaussianity. Our results show that inpainting\nallows to achieve optimality also for bispectrum estimation, but interestingly\nalso demonstrate that appropriate apodisation, in conjunction with low-l\ncleaning, can lead to comparable accuracy.\n", "  Unpredictability, or randomness, of the outcomes of measurements made on an\nentangled state can be certified provided that the statistics violate a Bell\ninequality. In the standard Bell scenario where each party performs a single\nmeasurement on its share of the system, only a finite amount of randomness, of\nat most $4 log_2 d$ bits, can be certified from a pair of entangled particles\nof dimension $d$. Our work shows that this fundamental limitation can be\novercome using sequences of (nonprojective) measurements on the same system.\nMore precisely, we prove that one can certify any amount of random bits from a\npair of qubits in a pure state as the resource, even if it is arbitrarily\nweakly entangled. In addition, this certification is achieved by near-maximal\nviolation of a particular Bell inequality for each measurement in the sequence.\n", "  Recent developments in quantum gas microscopy open up the possibility of\nreal-time observation of quantum many-body systems. To understand the dynamics\nof atoms under such circumstances, we formulate the dynamics under a real-time\nspatially resolved measurement and show that, in an appropriate limit of weak\nspatial resolution and strong atom-light coupling, the measurement\nindistinguishability of particles results in complete suppression of relative\npositional decoherence. As a consequence, quantum correlation in the\nmulti-particle dynamics persists under a minimally destructive observation. We\nnumerically demonstrate this for ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. Our\ntheoretical framework can be applied to feedback control of quantum many-body\nsystems which may be realized in subwavelength-spacing lattice systems.\n", "  The fluctuations of 5D self-gravitating non-abelian kinks which arise from\nthe breaking of the SU(5) X Z2 symmetric theory are analyzed within the context\nof brane-worlds. While tensor and vector sectors of these fluctuations behave\nlike its counterparts in the standard abelian Z2 kinks, the mixing between the\nfield excitations of the non-abelian kink and the scalar components of the\nmetric makes the pure scalar sector of the theory very interesting. The\nspectrum of these scalar fluctuations, which includes gravitationally trapped\nmassless modes on the core of the wall associated to the broken symmetries, is\ndiscussed for the two classes of kinks that break SU(5) to its maximal\nsubgroups.\n", "  The notion of a weak chimeras provides a tractable definition for chimera\nstates in networks of finitely many phase oscillators. Here we generalize the\ndefinition of a weak chimera to a more general class of equivariant dynamical\nsystems by characterizing solutions in terms of the isotropy of their angular\nfrequency vector - for coupled phase oscillators the angular frequency vector\nis given by the average of the vector field along a trajectory. Symmetries of\nsolutions automatically imply angular frequency synchronization. We show that\nthe presence of such symmetries is not necessary by giving a result for the\nexistence of weak chimeras without instantaneous or setwise symmetries for\ncoupled phase oscillators. Moreover, we construct a coupling function that\ngives rise to chaotic weak chimeras without symmetry in weakly coupled\npopulations of phase oscillators with generalized coupling.\n", "  We study unit-level expenditure on consumption across multiple countries and\nmultiple years, in order to extract invariant features of consumption\ndistribution. We show that the bulk of it is lognormally distributed, followed\nby a power law tail at the limit. The distributions coincide with each other\nunder normalization by mean expenditure and log scaling even though the data is\nsampled across multiple dimension including, e.g., time, social structure and\nlocations. This phenomenon indicates that the dispersions in consumption\nexpenditure across various social and economic groups are significantly similar\nsubject to suitable scaling and normalization. Further, the results provide a\nmeasurement of the core distributional features. Other descriptive factors\nincluding those of sociological, demographic and political nature, add further\nlayers of variation on the this core distribution. We present a stochastic\nmultiplicative model to quantitatively characterize the invariance and the\ndistributional features.\n", "  We study a large data set of protein structure ensembles of very diverse\nsizes determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. By examining the\ndistance-dependent correlations in the displacement of residues pairs and\nconducting finite size scaling analysis it was found that the correlations and\nsusceptibility behave as in systems near a critical point implying that, at the\nnative state, the motion of each amino acid residue is felt by every other\nresidue up to the size of the protein molecule. Furthermore certain protein's\nshapes corresponding to maximum susceptibility were found to be more probable\nthan others. Overall the results suggest that the protein's native state is\ncritical, implying that despite being posed near the minimum of the energy\nlandscape, they still preserve their dynamic flexibility.\n", "  We report the discovery of a partial conservation law obeyed by a schematic\nHamiltonian of two protons and two neutrons in a j shell. In our Hamiltonian\nthe interaction matrix element of two nucleons with combined angular momentum J\nis linear in J for even J and constant for odd J. It turns out that in some\nstationary states the sum J_p + J_n of the angular momenta J_p and J_n of the\nproton and neutron pairs is conserved. The energies of these states are given\nby a linear function of J_p + J_n. The systematics of their occurrence is\ndescribed and explained.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of identical dipolar fermions with aligned dipole\nmoments in two-dimensional multilayers at zero temperature. We consider density\ninstabilities that are driven by the attractive part of the dipolar interaction\nand, for the case of bilayers, we elucidate the properties of the stripe phase\nrecently predicted to exist in this interaction regime. When the number of\nlayers is increased, we find that this \"attractive\" stripe phase exists for an\nincreasingly larger range of dipole angles, and if the interlayer distance is\nsufficiently small, the stripe phase eventually spans the full range of angles,\nincluding the situation where the dipole moments are aligned perpendicular to\nthe planes. In the limit of an infinite number of layers, we derive an analytic\nexpression for the interlayer effects in the density-density response function\nand, using this result, we find that the stripe phase is replaced by a collapse\nof the dipolar system.\n", "  We study the possible effects of classical gravitational backgrounds on the\nHiggs field through the modifications induced in the one-loop effective\npotential and the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. We\nconcentrate our study on the Higgs self-interaction contribution in a perturbed\nFRW metric. For weak and slowly varying gravitational fields, a complete set of\nmode solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation is obtained to leading order in\nthe adiabatic approximation. Dimensional regularization has been used in the\nintegral evaluation and a detailed study of the integration of nonrational\nfunctions in this formalism has been presented. As expected, the regularized\neffective potential contains the same divergences as in flat spacetime, which\ncan be renormalized without the need of additional counterterms. We find that,\nin contrast with other regularization methods, even though metric perturbations\naffect the mode solutions, they do not contribute to the leading adiabatic\norder of the potential. We also obtain explicit expressions of the complete\nenergy-momentum tensor for general nonminimal coupling in terms of the\nperturbed modes. The corresponding leading adiabatic contributions are also\nobtained.\n", "  The paper investigates the dissipation tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ in wall\nturbulence. Available DNS data are examined to illustrate the differences in\nthe anisotropy of the dissipation tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ with respect to the\nanisotropy of the Reynolds-stresses $r_{ij}$. The budgets of the transport\nequations of the dissipation tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are studied using novel\nDNS data of low-Reynolds-number turbulent plane channel flow with spatial\nresolution sufficiently fine to accurately determine the correlations of\nproducts of 2-derivatives of fluctuating velocities $u_i'$ and pressure $p'$\nwhich appear in various terms. Finally, the influence of the Reynolds number on\nthe diagonal components of $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ ($\\varepsilon_{xx}$,\n$\\varepsilon_{yy}$, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$) and on the various terms in their\ntransport equations is studied using available DNS data of Vreman and Kuerten\n(Phys. Fluids 26 (2014) 085103).\n", "  We present the first search for a dark matter annual modulation signal in the\nSouthern Hemisphere conducted with NaI(Tl) detectors, performed by the DM-Ice17\nexperiment. Nuclear recoils from dark matter interactions are expected to yield\nan annually modulated signal independent of location within the Earth's\nhemispheres. DM-Ice17, the first step in the DM-Ice experimental program,\nconsists of 17 kg of NaI(Tl) located at the South Pole under 2200 m.w.e.\noverburden of Antarctic glacial ice. Taken over 3.6 years for a total exposure\nof 60.8 kg yr, DM-Ice17 data are consistent with no modulation in the energy\nrange of 4-20 keV, providing the strongest limits on weakly interacting massive\nparticle dark matter from a direct detection experiment located in the Southern\nHemisphere. The successful deployment and stable long-term operation of\nDM-Ice17 establishes the South Pole ice as a viable location for future dark\nmatter searches and in particular for a high-sensitivity NaI(Tl) dark matter\nexperiment to directly test the DAMA/LIBRA claim of the observation of dark\nmatter.\n", "  We study the effect of multiple parton radiation to Higgs boson plus jet\nproduction at the LHC, by applying the transverse momentum dependent (TMD)\nfactorization formalism to resum large logarithmic contributions to all orders\nin the expansion of the strong interaction coupling. We show that the\nappropriate resummation scale should be the jet transverse momentum, rather\nthan the partonic center of mass energy which has been normally used in the TMD\nresummation formalism. Furthermore, the transverse momentum distribution of the\nHiggs boson, particularly near the lower cut-off applied on the jet transverse\nmomentum, can only be reliably predicted by the resummation calculation which\nis free of the so-called Sudakov-shoulder singularity problem, present in\nfixed-order calculations.\n", "  Entangling properties of a mixed 2-qubit system can be described by the local\nhomogeneous unitary invariant polynomials in elements of the density matrix.\nThe structure of the corresponding invariant polynomial ring for the special\nsubclass of states, the so-called mixed X-states, is established. It is shown\nthat for the X-states there is an injective ring homomorphism of the quotient\nring of SU(2)xSU(2) invariant polynomials modulo its syzygy ideal and the\nSO(2)xSO(2)-invariant ring freely generated by five homogeneous polynomials of\ndegrees 1,1,1,2,2.\n", "  We consider the leading and subleading UV divergences for the four-point\non-shell scattering amplitudes in D=8 N=1 sypersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\nwithin the spinor-helicity and superfield formalism. This theory belongs to the\nclass of maximally supersymmetric gauge theories and presumably possesses\ndistinguished properties beyond perturbation theory. We obtain the recursive\nrelations that allow one to get the leading and subleading divergences in all\nloops in a pure algebraic way staring from the one loop (for the leading poles)\nand two loop (for the subleading ones) diagrams. As a particular example where\nthe recursive relations have a simple form we consider the ladder type\ndiagrams. The all loop summation of the leading and subleading divergences is\nperformed with the help of the differential equations which are the\ngeneralization of the RG equations for non-renormalizable theories. They have\nexplicit solutions for the ladder type diagrams. We discuss the properties of\nthe obtained solutions and interpretation of the results.\n", "  We study the worldsheet S-matrix of a string attached to a D-brane in\nAdS$_5\\times$S$^5$. The D-brane is either a giant graviton or a dual giant\ngraviton. In the gauge theory, the operators we consider belong to the\n$su(2|3)$ sector of the theory. Magnon excitations of open strings can exhibit\nboth elastic (when magnons in the bulk of the string scatter) and inelastic\n(when magnons at the endpoint of an open string participate) scattering. Both\nof these $S$-matrices are determined (up to an overall phase) by the\n$su(2|2)^2$ global symmetry of the theory. In this note we study the $S$-matrix\nfor inelastic scattering. We show that it exhibits poles corresponding to\nboundstates of bulk and boundary magnons. A crossing equation is derived for\nthe overall phase. It reproduces the crossing equation for maximal giant\ngravitons, in the appropriate limit. Finally, scattering in the $su(2)$ sector\nis computed to two loops. This two loop result, which determines the overall\nphase to two loops, will be useful when a unique solution to the crossing\nequation is to be selected.\n", "  We use spatially-resolved transport techniques to investigate the\nsuperconducting properties of single crystals La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$. We find\na new superconducting transition temperature $T_{cs}$ associated with the\nab-plane surface region which is considerably higher than the bulk $T_c$. The\neffect is pronounced in the region of charge carrier doping $x$ with strong\nspin-charge stripe correlations, reaching $T_{cs}=36$ K or 1.64$T_c$.\n", "  Topological semimetals have energy bands near the Fermi energy sticking\ntogether at isolated points/lines/planes in the momentum space, which are often\naccompanied by stable surface states and intriguing bulk topological responses.\nAlthough it has been known that certain crystalline symmetries play an\nimportant role in protecting band degeneracy, a general recipe for stabilizing\nthe degeneracy, especially in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, is still\nlacking. Here we show that a class of novel topological semimetals with\npoint/line nodes can emerge in the presence of an off-centered rotation/mirror\nsymmetry whose symmetry line/plane is displaced from the center of other\nsymmorphic symmetries in nonsymmorphic crystals. Due to the partial translation\nperpendicular to the rotation axis/mirror plane, an off-centered\nrotation/mirror symmetry always forces two energy bands to stick together and\nform a doublet pair in the relevant invariant line/plane in momentum space.\nSuch a doublet pair provides a basic building block for emerging topological\nsemimetals with point/line nodes in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We quantify the systematic effects on the stellar mass function which arise\nfrom assumptions about the stellar population, as well as how one fits the\nlight profiles of the most luminous galaxies at z ~ 0.1. When comparing results\nfrom the literature, we are careful to separate out these effects. Our analysis\nshows that while systematics in the estimated comoving number density which\narise from different treatments of the stellar population remain of order < 0.5\ndex, systematics in photometry are now about 0.1 dex, despite recent claims in\nthe literature. Compared to these more recent analyses, previous work based on\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) pipeline photometry leads to underestimates of\nrho_*(> M_*) by factors of 3-10 in the mass range 10^11 - 10^11.6 M_Sun, but up\nto a factor of 100 at higher stellar masses. This impacts studies which match\nmassive galaxies to dark matter halos. Although systematics which arise from\ndifferent treatments of the stellar population remain of order < 0.5 dex, our\nfinding that systematics in photometry now amount to only about 0.1 dex in the\nstellar mass density is a significant improvement with respect to a decade ago.\nOur results highlight the importance of using the same stellar population and\nphotometric models whenever low and high redshift samples are compared.\n", "  We propose a method for the algorithmic quantum simulation of memory effects\ndescribed by integrodifferential evolution equations. It consists in the\nsystematic use of perturbation theory techniques and a Markovian quantum\nsimulator. Our method aims to efficiently simulate both completely positive and\nnonpositive dynamics without the requirement of engineering non-Markovian\nenvironments. Finally, we find that small error bounds can be reached with\npolynomially scaling resources, evaluated as the time required for the\nsimulation.\n", "  Topological Weyl semimetals (TWS) can be classified as type-I TWS, in which\nthe density of states vanishes at the Weyl nodes, and type-II TWS where an\nelectron and a hole pocket meet with finite density of states at the nodal\nenergy. The dispersions of type-II Weyl nodes are tilted and break Lorentz\ninvariance, allowing for physical properties distinct from those in a type-I\nTWS. We present minimal lattice models for both time-reversal-breaking and\ninversion-breaking type-II Weyl semimetals, and investigate their bulk\nproperties and topological surface states. These lattice models capture the\nextended Fermi pockets and the connectivities of Fermi arcs. In addition to the\nFermi arcs, which are topologically protected, we identify surface \"track\nstates\" that arise out of the topological Fermi arc states at the transition\nfrom type-I to type-II with multiple Weyl nodes, and persist in the type-II\nTWS.\n", "  Bad cavity lasers are experiencing renewed interest in the context of active\noptical frequency standards, due to their enhanced robustness against\nfluctuations of the laser cavity. The gain medium would consist of\nnarrow-linewidth atoms, either trapped inside the cavity or intersecting the\ncavity mode dynamically. A series of effects like the atoms finite velocity\ndistribution, atomic interactions, or interactions of realistic multilevel\natoms with auxiliary or stray fields can lead to an inhomogeneous broadening of\nthe atomic gain profile. This causes the emergence of instable regimes of laser\noperation, characterized by complex temporal patterns of the field amplitude.\nWe study the steady-state solutions and their stability for the\nmetrology-relevant case of a bad cavity laser with spin-1/2 atoms, such as\nYb-171, interacting with an external magnetic field. For the stability\nanalysis, we present a new and efficient method, that can be applied to a broad\nclass of single-mode bad cavity lasers with inhomogeneously broadened\nmultilevel atoms acting as gain medium.\n", "  We propose a quantum thermal machine composed of two nanomechanical\nresonators (NMR) (two membranes suspended over a trench in a substrate), placed\na few $\\mu$m from each other. The quantum thermodynamical cycle is powered by\nthe Casimir interaction between the resonators and the working fluid is the\npolariton resulting from the mixture of the flexural (out-of-plane) vibrations.\nWith the help of piezoelectric cells, we select and sweep the polariton\nfrequency cyclically. We calculate the performance of the proposed quantum\nthermal machines and show that high efficiencies are achieved thanks to (i) the\nstrong coupling between the resonators and (ii) the large difference between\nthe membrane stiffnesses. Our findings can be of particular importance for\napplications in nanomechanical technologies where a sensitive control of\ntemperature is needed.\n", "  The decoupling technique is a fundamental tool in quantum information theory\nwith applications ranging from quantum thermodynamics to quantum many body\nphysics to the study of black hole radiation. In this work we introduce the\nnotion of catalytic decoupling, that is, decoupling in the presence of an\nuncorrelated ancilla system. This removes a restriction on the standard notion\nof decoupling, which becomes important for structureless resources, and yields\na tight characterization in terms of the max-mutual information. Catalytic\ndecoupling naturally unifies various tasks like the erasure of correlations and\nquantum state merging, and leads to a resource theory of decoupling.\n", "  Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is one of the most powerful\nnumerical methods available for many-body systems. In this work, we develop a\nperturbation theory of DMRG (PT-DMRG) to largely increase its accuracy in an\nextremely simple and efficient way. By using the canonical matrix product state\n(MPS) representation for the ground state of the considered system, a set of\northogonal basis functions $\\left\\lbrace | \\psi_i \\rangle \\right\\rbrace$ is\nintroduced to describe the perturbations to the ground state obtained by the\nconventional DMRG. The Schmidt numbers of the MPS that are beyond the bond\ndimension cut-off are used to define such perturbation terms. The perturbed\nHamiltonian is then defined as $\\tilde{H}_{ij}= \\langle \\psi_i | \\hat{H} |\n\\psi_j \\rangle$; its ground state permits to calculate physical observables\nwith a considerably improved accuracy as compared to the original DMRG results.\nWe benchmark the second-order perturbation theory with the help of\none-dimensional Ising chain in a transverse field and the Heisenberg chain,\nwhere the precision of DMRG is shown to be improved $\\rm O(10)$ times.\nFurthermore, for moderate length $L$ the errors of DMRG and PT-DMRG both scale\nlinearly with $L^{-1}$. The linear relation between the dimension cut-off of\nDMRG and that of PT-DMRG with the same precision shows a considerable\nimprovement of efficiency, especially for large dimension cut-off's. In\nthermodynamic limit we show that the errors of PT-DMRG scale with\n$\\sqrt{L^{-1}}$. Our work suggests an effective way to define the tangent space\nof the ground state MPS, which may shed lights on the properties beyond the\nground state. Such second-order PT-DMRG can be readily generalized to higher\norders, as well as applied to the models in higher dimensions.\n", "  Here we report the discovery of superconductivity in multiple phases of the\ncompressed GeSb2Te4 (GST) phase change memory alloy, which has attracted\nconsiderable attention for the last decade due to its unusual physical\nproperties with many potential applications. Superconductivity is observed\nthrough electrical transport measurements, both for the amorphous (a-GST) and\nfor the crystalline (c-GST) phases. The superconducting critical temperature,\nTC, continuously increases with the applied pressure reaching a maximum Tc =6K\nat P=20 GPa for a-GST, whereas the critical temperature of the cubic phase\nreaches a maximum Tc =8 K at 30 GPa. This new material system, exhibiting a\nsuperconductor-insulator quantum phase transition (SIT) has an advantage over\ndisordered metals since it has a continuous control of the crystal structure\nand the electronic properties using pressure as an external stimulus, which was\nlacking in SIT studies until today.\n", "  We are in the middle of a complex debate as to whether Economics is really a\nproper natural science. The 'Discussion & Debate' issue of this Euro. Phys. J.\nSpecial Topic volume is: 'Can economics be a Physical Science?' I discuss some\naspects here.\n", "  We consider unitarity and causality in a higher-derivative theory of infinite\norder, where propagators fall off more quickly in the ultraviolet due to the\npresence of a transcendental entire function of the momentum. Like Lee-Wick\ntheories, these field theories might provide new avenues for addressing the\nhierarchy problem; unlike Lee-Wick theories, tree-level propagators do not have\nadditional poles corresponding to unobserved particles with unusual properties.\nWe consider microscopic acausality in these nonlocal theories. The acausal\nordering of production and decay vertices for ordinary resonant particles may\nprovide a phenomenologically distinct signature for these models.\n", "  There exists a fascinating dual representation of the electric ac current\nflowing through a normal conductor. On the one hand, it can be understood in\nterms of charge transport. On the other hand, it consists in an electomagnetic\nfield guided by conducting structures embedded in an insulator. The former\npoint of view, in its quantum version, is particularly adapted to describe the\nelectron shot noise in a coherent conductor, like a tunnel junction at\nultra-low temperature. However, when the junction is appropriately biased by a\ndc and an ac voltage, the noise it generates is best analyzed using the latter\nrepresentation and the tools of quantum optics, as the radiation exhibits clear\nsigns of non-classicality. Herein, we report the measurement of the statistics\nof photons emitted by such a tunnel junction. We observe a photon shot noise\ncharacteristic of photon pair emission, as its Fano factor for small signal is\nabove unity. The theory of electron shot noise, dealing exclusively with the\ntunneling of charges through the junction, quantitatively fits the data from\nwhich photon shot noise is extracted. This experiment thus provides a clear\nlink between the dual representations.\n", "  We report on the existence of discrete breathers in a one-dimensional,\nmass-in-mass chain with linear intersite coupling and nonlinear Hertzian local\nresonators, which is motivated by recent studies of the dynamics of\nmicrospheres adhered to elastic substrates. After predicting theoretically the\nexistence of the discrete breathers in the continuum and anticontinuum limits\nof intersite coupling, we use numerical continuation to compute a family of\nbreathers interpolating between the two regimes in a finite chain, where the\ndisplacement profiles of the breathers are localized around one or two lattice\nsites. We then analyze the frequency-amplitude dependence of the breathers by\nperforming numerical continuation on a linear eigenmode (vanishing amplitude)\nsolution of the system near the upper band gap edge. Finally, we use direct\nnumerical integration of the equations of motion to demonstrate the formation\nand evolution of the identified localized modes, including within settings that\nmay be relevant to future experimental studies.\n", "  We develop models for time lag between maxima of the source brightness in\ndifferent wavelengths during a transient flash of luminosity connected with a\nshort period of increase of the mass flux onto the central compact object.\n  We derive a simple formula for finding the time delay among events in\ndifferent wavelengths, valid in general for all disk accreting cosmic sources,\nand discuss quantitatively a model for time lag formation in AGNs.\n  In close binaries with accretion disks the time lag is connected with effects\nof viscosity defining a radial motion of matter in the accretion disk. In AGN\nflashes, the falling matter has a low angular momentum, and the time lag is\ndefined by the free fall time to the gravitating center.\n  We show the validity of these models by means of several examples of galactic\nand extragalactic accreting sources.\n", "  We propose a two-phase-fluid model for a full-cone turbulent round jet that\ndescribes its dynamics in a simple but comprehensive manner with only the apex\nangle of the cone being a disposable parameter. The basic assumptions are that\n(i) the jet is statistically stationary and that (ii) it can be approximated by\na mixture of two fluids with their phases in dynamic equilibrium. To derive the\nmodel, we impose conservation of the initial volume and total momentum fluxes.\nOur model equations admit analytical solutions for the composite density and\nvelocity of the two-phase fluid, both as functions of the distance from the\nnozzle, from which the dynamic pressure and the mass entrainment rate are\ncalculated. Assuming a far-field approximation, we theoretically derive a\nconstant entrainment rate coefficient solely in terms of the cone angle.\nMoreover, we carry out experiments for a single-phase turbulent air jet and\nshow that the predictions of our model compare well with this and other\nexperimental data of atomizing liquid jets.\n", "  We present a quantum theory for a fully coupled hybrid optomechanical system\nwhere all mutual couplings between a two-level atom, a confined photon mode and\na mechanical oscillator mode are considered. In such a configuration, new\nquantum interference effects and correlations arise due to the interplay and\ncompetition between the different physical interactions. We present an\nanalytical diagonalization of the related fully coupled Hamiltonian, showing\nthe nature and energy spectra of the tripartite dressed excitations. We\ndetermine the driven-dissipative dynamics of such hybrid systems and study\nphonon blockade effects under resonant excitation. We also study the\nstatistical properties of the photon emission obtained under incoherent pumping\nof the two-level atom, which is particularly relevant for experiments with\nsolid-state two-level emitters.\n", "  Networks of particles connected by springs model many condensed-matter\nsystems, from colloids interacting with a short-range potential, to complex\nfluids near jamming, to self-assembled lattices, to origami-inspired materials.\nUnder small thermal fluctuations the vibrational entropy of a ground state is\ngiven by the harmonic approximation if it has no zero-frequency vibrational\nmodes, yet such singular modes are at the epicenter of many interesting\nbehaviors in the systems above. We consider a system of $N$ spherical\nparticles, and directly account for the singularities that arise in the sticky\nlimit where the pairwise interaction is strong and short ranged. Although the\ncontribution to the partition function from singular clusters diverges in the\nlimit, its asymptotic value can be calculated and depends on only two\nparameters, characterizing the depth and range of the potential. The result\nholds for systems that are second-order rigid, a geometric characterization\nthat describes all known ground-state (rigid) sticky clusters.\n  To illustrate our theory we address the question of emergence: how does\ncrystalline order arise in large systems when it is strongly disfavored in\nsmall ones? We calculate the partition functions of all known rigid clusters up\nto $N\\leq 19$, and show the cluster landscape is dominated by hyperstatic\nclusters (those with more than $3N-6$ contacts) -- singular and isostatic\nclusters are far less frequent, despite their extra vibrational and\nconfigurational entropies. Since the most hyperstatic clusters are close to\nfragments of a close-packed lattice, this underlies the emergence of order in\nsticky-sphere systems, even those as small as $N=10$.\n", "  In this paper we provide the criteria for any generally covariant, parity\npreserving, and torsion free theory of gravity to possess a stable de Sitter\n(dS) or anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. By stability we mean the absence of\ntachyonic or ghost-like states in the perturbative spectrum that can lead to\nclassical instabilities and violation of quantum unitarity. While we find that\nthe usual suspects, the F(R) and F(G) theories, can indeed possess consistent\n(A)dS backgrounds, G being the Gauss-Bonnet term, another interesting class of\ntheories, string-inspired infinite derivative gravity, can also be consistent\naround such curved vacuum solutions. Our study should not only be relevant for\nquantum gravity and early universe cosmology involving ultraviolet physics, but\nalso for modifications of gravity in the infra-red sector vying to replace dark\nenergy .\n", "  We analyse the angular velocity of a small neutrally buoyant spheroid log\nrolling in a simple shear. When the effect of fluid inertia is negligible the\nangular velocity $\\omega$ equals half the fluid vorticity. We compute by\nsingular perturbation theory how weak fluid inertia reduces the angular\nvelocity in an unbounded shear, and how this reduction depends upon the shape\nof the spheroid (on its aspect ratio). In addition we determine the angular\nvelocity by direct numerical simulations. The results are in excellent\nagreement with the theory at small but not too small values of the shear\nReynolds number, for all aspect ratios considered. For the special case of a\nsphere we find $\\omega/s = -1/2+0.0540\\, \\mbox{Re}_\\mbox{s}^{3/2}$ where $s$ is\nthe shear rate, and $\\mbox{Re}_\\mbox{s}$ is the shear Reynolds number. This\nresult differs from that derived by Lin et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 44 (1970) 1] who\nobtained a numerical coefficient roughly three times larger.\n", "  The paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking encompasses the breaking of the\nrotational symmetries $O(3)$ of isotropic space to a discrete subgroup, i.e. a\nthree-dimensional point group. The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow\nfor many different phases of matter with orientational order. Such spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such\nanisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the\nfamiliar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary\npoint group symmetry, referred to as \\emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a\nlarge hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We\ndiscuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial\npoint groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge\ntheoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K. Liu, J. Nissinen, R.-J.\nSlager, K. Wu, J. Zaanen, Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 6}, 041025 (2016)]. These\ntransitions can be introduced in the model by considering anisotropic couplings\nthat do not break any additional symmetries. By and large this generalizes the\nwell-known uniaxial-biaxial nematic phase transition to any arbitrary axial\npoint group in three dimensions. We find in particular that the generalized\naxial transitions are distinguished by two types of phase diagrams with\nintermediate vestigial orientational phases and that the window of the\nvestigial phase is intimately related to the amount of symmetry of the defining\npoint group due to inherently growing fluctuations of the order parameter. This\nmight explain the stability of the observed uniaxial-biaxial phases as compared\nto the yet to be observed other possible forms of generalized nematic order\nwith higher point group symmetries.\n", "  The role of entanglement and quantum correlations in complex physical systems\nand quantum information processing devices has become a topic of intense study\nin the past two decades. In this work we present new tools for learning about\nentanglement and quantum correlations in dynamical systems where the quantum\nstates are mixed and the eigenvalue spectrum is highly degenerate. We apply\nthese results to the Deterministic quantum computing with one qubit (DQC1)\ncomputation model and show that the states generated in a DQC1 circuit have an\neigenvalue structure that makes them difficult to entangle, even when they are\nrelatively far from the completely mixed state. Our results strengthen the\nconjecture that it may be possible to find quantum algorithms that do not\ngenerate entanglement and yet still have an exponential advantage over their\nclassical counterparts.\n", "  The internal and lattice structures of magnetic skyrmions in B20-type FeGe\nare investigated using off-axis electron holography. The temperature, magnetic\nfield and angular dependence of the magnetic moments of individual skyrmions\nare analyzed. Whereas the internal skyrmion shape is found to vary with\nmagnetic field, the inter-skyrmion distance remains almost unchanged in the\nlattice phase. The amplitude of the local magnetic moment is found to depend on\ntemperature, while the skyrmion shape does not. Deviations from a circular to a\nhexagonal skyrmion structure are observed in the lattice phase.\n", "  Among hundreds of spinel oxides, LiTi2O4 (LTO) is the only one that exhibits\nsuperconductivity (Tc ~13 K). Although the general electron-phonon coupling is\nstill the main mechanism for electron pairing in LTO, unconventional behaviors\nsuch as the anomalous magnetoresistance, anisotropic orbital/spin\nsusceptibilities, etc. reveal that both the spin and the orbital interactions\nshould also be considered for understanding the superconductivity. Here, we\ninvestigate tunneling spectra of [111]-, [110]- and [001]-oriented high quality\nLTO thin films. Several bosonic modes in tunneling spectra are observed in the\n[111]- and [110]-oriented films but not in [001]-oriented ones, and these modes\nstill exist at T = 2Tc and beyond the upper critical field, which are confirmed\nas stemming from electron-phonon interaction by DFT calculations. These modes\nonly appear in special surface orientations, indicating that the\nelectron-phonon coupling in LTO system is highly anisotropic and may be\nenhanced by orbital-related state. The anisotropic electron-phonon coupling\nshould be taken seriously in understanding the nature of LTO superconductivity.\n", "  The characterization of the Galactic foregrounds has been shown to be the\nmain obstacle in the challenging quest to detect primordial B-modes in the\npolarized microwave sky. We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at\nhigh frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized\nthermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study\nthe spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution, and\nits potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We use\nthe correlation ratio of the $C_\\ell^{BB}$ angular power spectra between the\n217- and 353-GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed\non different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the\nsky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio\nfrom unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the\ncosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics.\nThe effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical\ncombination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this\nvariation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the\ndecorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of\nthe region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law\nempirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck\ndata. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations\nof the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints\nfrom those data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353GHz\nof the order of the one we measure. Finally we show that either spatial\nvariation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle could produce\ndecorrelations between 217- and 353-GHz data similar to those we observe in the\ndata.\n", "  The structure and properties of the 1:1 superlattice of LaVO$_{3}$ and\nSrVO$_{3}$ are investigated with a first-principles\ndensity-functional-theory-plus-$U$ (DFT+$U$) method. The lowest energy states\nare antiferromagnetic charge-ordered Mott-insulating phases. In one of these\ninsulating phases, layered charge ordering combines with the layered cation\nordering to produce a polar structure with nonzero spontaneous polarization\nnormal to the interfaces. This polarization is produced by electron transfer\nbetween the V$^{3+}$ and V$^{4+}$ layers, and is comparable to that of\nconventional ferroelectrics. The energy of this polar state relative to the\nnonpolar ground state is only 3 meV per vanadium. Under tensile strain, this\nenergy difference can be further reduced, suggesting that the polar phase can\nbe induced by applied electric field, yielding an antiferroelectric\ndouble-hysteresis loop. If the system does not switch back to the nonpolar\nstate on removal of the field, a ferroelectric-type hysteresis loop could be\nobserved.\n", "  We analytically compute the five-loop term in the beta function which governs\nthe running of $\\alpha_s$ --- the quark-gluon coupling constant in QCD. The new\nterm leads to a reduction of the theory uncertainty in $\\alpha_s$ taken at the\nZ-boson scale as extracted from the $\\tau$-lepton decays as well as to new,\nimproved by one more order of perturbation theory, predictions for the\neffective coupling constants of the Standard Model Higgs boson to gluons and\nfor its total decay rate to the quark-antiquark pairs.\n", "  In this letter we show that the vortex lattice structure in the Bose-Fermi\nsuperfluid mixture can undergo a sequence of structure transitions when the\nFermi superfluid is tuned from the BCS regime to the BEC regime. This is due to\ndifferent vortex core structure of the Fermi superfluid in the BCS regime and\nin the BEC regime. In the former the vortex core is nearly filled, while the\ndensity at the vortex core gradually decreases until it empties out at the BEC\nregime. Therefore, with the density-density interaction between the Bose and\nthe Fermi superfluids, the two sets of vortex lattices interact stronger in the\nBEC regime that yields the structure transition of vortex lattices. In view of\nrecent realization of this superfluid mixture and vortices therein, our\ntheoretical predication can be verified experimentally in near future.\n", "  We followed the evolution of the normal and superconducting properties of Al\nthin films after each session of various successive oxygen irradiations at\nambient temperature. Such irradiated films, similar to the granular ones,\nexhibit enhanced superconductivity, Kondo behavior and negative-curvature\nresistivity. Two distinct roles of oxygen are identified: as a damage-causing\nprojectile and as an implanted oxidizing agent. The former gives rise to the\nprocesses involved in the conventional recovery stages. The latter, considered\nwithin the context of the Cabrera-Mott model, gives rise to a multistep process\nwhich involves charges transfer and creation of stabilized vacancies and\ncharged defects. Based on the outcome of this multistep process, we consider\n(i) the negative curvature resistivity as a manifestation of a\nthermally-assisted liberation of trapped electric charges, (ii) the Kondo\ncontribution as a spin-flip scattering from paramagnetic, color-center-type\ndefects, and (iii) the enhancement of T_{c} as being due to a lattice softening\nfacilitated by the stabilized defects and vacancies. The similarity in the\nphase diagrams of granular and irradiated films as well as the aging effects\nare discussed along the same line of reasoning.\n", "  Semileptonic $B$ meson decays into the four lightest excited charmed meson\nstates ($D_0^*$, $D_1^*$, $D_1$, and $D_2^*$) and their counterparts with $s$\nquarks are investigated, including the full lepton mass dependence. We derive\nthe standard model predictions for the differential branching fractions, as\nwell as predictions for the ratios of the semi-tauonic and light lepton\nsemileptonic branching fractions. These can be systematically improved using\nfuture measurements of the total or differential semileptonic rates to $e$ and\n$\\mu$, as well as the two-body hadronic branching fractions with a pion,\nrelated by factorization to the semileptonic rate at maximal recoil. To\nillustrate the different sensitivities to new physics, we explore the\ndependence of the ratio of semi-tauonic and light-lepton branching fractions on\nthe type-II and type-III two-Higgs-doublet model parameters, $\\tan\\beta$ and\n$m_{H}^\\pm$, for all four states.\n", "  Iron oxide is a key compound to understand the state of the deep Earth. It\nhas been believed that previously known oxides such as FeO and Fe2O3 will be\ndominant at the mantle conditions. However, recent observation of FeO2 shed\nanother light to the composition of the deep lower mantle (DLM) and thus\nunderstanding of the physical properties of FeO2 will be critical to model DLM.\nHere, we report the electronic structure and structural properties of FeO2 by\nusing density functional theory (DFT) and dynamic mean field theory (DMFT). The\ncrystal structure of FeO2 is composed of Fe2+ and O2 2- dimers, where the Fe\nions are surround by the octahedral O atoms. We found that the bond length of\nO2 dimer, which is very sensitive to the change of the Coulomb interaction U of\nFe 3d orbital, plays an important role in determining the electronic\nstructures. The band structures of DFT+DMFT show that the metal-insulator\ntransition is driven by the change of U and pressure. We suggest that the\ncorrelation effect should be considered to correctly describe the physical\nproperties of FeO2 compound.\n", "  The classical quantization of the motion of a free particle and that of an\nharmonic oscillator on a double cone are achieved by a quantization scheme\n[M.C. Nucci, Theor. Math. Phys. 168 (2011) 994], that preserves the Noether\npoint symmetries of the underlying Lagrangian in order to construct the\nSchroedinger equation. The result is different from that given in [K. Kowalski,\nJ.Rembielnski, Ann. Phys. 329 (2013) 146]. A comparison of the different\noutcomes is provided.\n", "  Several recent studies have demonstrated how large-scale vortices may arise\nspontaneously in rotating planar convection. Here we examine the dynamo\nproperties of such flows in rotating Boussinesq convection. For moderate values\nof the magnetic Reynolds number ($100 \\lesssim Rm \\lesssim 550$, with $Rm$\nbased on the box depth and the convective velocity), a large-scale (i.e.\nsystem-size) magnetic field is generated. The amplitude of the magnetic energy\noscillates in time, nearly out of phase with the oscillating amplitude of the\nlarge-scale vortex. The large-scale vortex is disrupted once the magnetic field\nreaches a critical strength, showing that these oscillations are of magnetic\norigin. The dynamo mechanism relies on those components of the flow that have\nlength scales lying between that of the large-scale vortex and the typical\nconvective cell size; smaller-scale flows are not required. The large-scale\nvortex plays a crucial role in the magnetic induction despite being essentially\ntwo-dimensional; we thus refer to this dynamo as a large-scale-vortex dynamo.\nFor larger magnetic Reynolds numbers, the dynamo is small scale, with a\nmagnetic energy spectrum that peaks at the scale of the convective cells. In\nthis case, the small-scale magnetic field continuously suppresses the\nlarge-scale vortex by disrupting the correlations between the convective\nvelocities that allow it to form. The suppression of the large-scale vortex at\nhigh $Rm$ therefore probably limits the relevance of the large-scale-vortex\ndynamo to astrophysical objects with moderate values of $Rm$, such as planets.\nIn this context, the ability of the large-scale-vortex dynamo to operate at low\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers is of great interest.\n", "  Electromagnetic current-current correlators in pionic and nucleonic medium\nhave been evaluated in the static limit to obtain electrical conductivities for\npion and nucleon components respectively, where former decreases and latter one\nincreases with the variation of temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu_N$. Therefore, total electrical conductivity of pion and nucleon system\nexhibits a valley structure in the $T$-$\\mu_N$ plane. To get non-divergent and\nfinite values of correlators, finite thermal widths of medium constituents,\npion and nucleon have been considered, where these thermal widths have been\ndetermined from the in-medium scattering probabilities of pion and nucleon with\nother mesonic and baryonic resonances, based on effective hadronic model. At\n$\\mu_N=0$, the results of present work are more or less agrees with the results\nof earlier works and its finite $\\mu_N$ extension show a decreasing nature of\nelectrical conductivity for hadronic medium during spanning from freeze out\nline to quark-hadron transition line in $T$-$\\mu_N$ plane.\n", "  We present a dynamical scheme for hadronization with first-order confinement\nphase transition. The thermodynamical conditions of phase equilibrium, the\nfluid velocity profile, and the dissipative effect determine the macroscopic\nchanges of the parton volume and the corresponding hadron volume during the\nphase transition. The macroscopic volume changes are the basis for building up\na dynamical scheme by considering microscopic transition processes from partons\nto hadrons and backwards. The established scheme is proved by comparing the\nnumerical results with the analytical solutions in the case of a\none-dimensional expansion of a dissipative fluid with Bjorken boost invariance.\nThe comparisons show almost perfect agreements, which demonstrate the\napplicability of the introduced scheme.\n", "  We analyse the contribution of $2n$ scalars to the Operator Product Expansion\nseries for MHV gluon scattering amplitudes/polygonal Wilson loops in planar\n${\\cal N}=4$ SYM. Hence, we sum up on $2n$ for large coupling $\\lambda$: the\nlogarithm of the amplitude is proportional to $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$, thus competing,\nunexpectedly, with the famous classical contribution. We give explicit\nexpressions for the first terms at large $\\lambda$ in case of two and four\nscalars. For finalising this analysis, we find profitable an explicit\ncomputation of the $2n$-scalar term at any coupling by means of Young tableaux,\nparalleling, under certain aspects, the Nekrasov-Okounkov expressions for\n$\\mathcal N =2$ SYM prepotential.\n", "  We provide an analysis on non-Markovian quantum evolution based on the\nspectral properties of dynamical maps. We introduce the dynamical analog of\nentanglement witness to detect non-Markovianity and we illustrate its behaviour\nwith several instructive examples. It is shown that for a certain class of\ndynamical maps the shape of the body of accessible states provides a simple\nnon-Markovianity witness.\n", "  Motivated by the experiments on the rare-earth double perovskites, we propose\na generalized Kitaev-Heisenberg model to describe the generic interaction\nbetween the spin-orbit-entangled Kramers' doublets of the rare-earth moments.\nWe carry out a systematic analysis of the mean-field phase diagram of this new\nmodel. In the phase diagram, there exist large regions with a continuous U(1)\nor O(3) degeneracy. Since no symmetry of the model protects such a continuous\ndegeneracy, we predict that the quantum fluctuation lifts the continuous\ndegeneracy and favors various magnetic orders in the phase diagram. From this\norder by quantum disorder mechanism, we further predict that the magnetic\nexcitations of the resulting ordered phases are characterized by nearly gapless\npseudo-Goldstone modes. We find that there exist Weyl magnon excitations for\ncertain magnetic orders. We expect our prediction to inspire further study of\nKitaev physics, the order by quantum disorder phenomenon and topological spin\nwave modes in the rare-earth magnets and the systems alike.\n", "  We find a first order transition driven by the strength of non-equilibrium\nconditions of one-dimensional driven open condensates. Associated with this\ntransition is a new stable non-equilibrium phase, space-time vortex turbulence,\nwhose vortex density and quasiparticle distribution show strongly non-thermal\nbehavior. Below the transition, we identify a new time scale associated with\nnoise activated unbound space-time vortices, beyond which the temporal\ncoherence function changes from a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang type subexponential to a\ndisordered exponential decay. Experimental realization of the non-equilibrium\nvortex turbulent phase is facilitated in driven open condensates with a large\ndiffusion rate.\n", "  We investigate the parity-violating pion-nucleon-nucleon coupling constant\n$h^1_{\\pi NN}$, based on the chiral quark-soliton model. We employ an effective\nweak Hamiltonian that takes into account the next-to-leading order corrections\nfrom QCD to the weak interactions at the quark level. Using the gradient\nexpansion, we derive the leading-order effective weak chiral Lagrangian with\nthe low-energy constants determined. The effective weak chiral Lagrangian is\nincorporated in the chiral quark-soliton model to calculate the\nparity-violating $\\pi NN$ constant $h^1_{\\pi NN}$. We obtain a value of about\n$10^{-7}$ at the leading order. The corrections from the next-to-leading order\nreduce the leading order result by about 20~\\%.\n", "  The observation of light super-partners from a supersymmetric extension to\nthe Standard Model is an intensely sought-after experimental outcome, providing\nan explanation for the stabilization of the electroweak scale and indicating\nthe existence of new particles which could be consistent with dark matter\nphenomenology. For compressed scenarios, where sparticle spectra\nmass-splittings are small and decay products carry low momenta, dedicated\ntechniques are required in all searches for supersymmetry. In this paper we\nsuggest an approach for these analyses based on the concept of Recursive Jigsaw\nReconstruction, decomposing each event into a basis of complementary\nobservables, for cases where strong initial state radiation has sufficient\ntransverse momentum to elicit the recoil of any final state sparticles. We\nintroduce a collection of kinematic observables which can be used to probe\ncompressed scenarios, in particular exploiting the correlation between missing\nmomentum and that of radiative jets. As an example, we study squark and gluino\nproduction, focusing on mass-splittings between parent super-particles and\ntheir lightest decay products between 25 and 200 GeV, in hadronic final states\nwhere there is an ambiguity in the provenance of reconstructed jets.\n", "  We examine the extent to which the properties of three-nucleon bound states\nare well-reproduced in the limit that nuclear forces satisfy Wigner's SU(4)\n(spin-isospin) symmetry. To do this we compute the charge radii up to\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) in an effective field theory (EFT) that is an\nexpansion in powers of $R/a$, with $R$ the range of the nuclear force and $a$\nthe nucleon-nucleon ($N\\!N$) scattering lengths. In the Wigner-SU(4) limit, the\ntriton and Helium-3 point charge radii are equal. At NLO in the range expansion\nboth are $1.66$ fm. Adding the first-order corrections due to the breaking of\nWigner symmetry in the $N\\!N$ scattering lengths gives a ${}^3\\mathrm{H}$ point\ncharge radius of $1.58$ fm, which is remarkably close to the experimental\nnumber, $1.5978\\pm0.040$ fm (Angeli and Marinova in At Data Nucl Data Tables\n99:69-95, 2013). For the ${}^3\\mathrm{He}$ point charge radius we find $1.70$\nfm, about 4% away from the experimental value of $1.77527\\pm0.0054$ fm (Angeli\nand Marinova 2013). We also examine the Faddeev components that enter the\ntri-nucleon wave function and find that an expansion of them in powers of the\nsymmetry-breaking parameter converges rapidly. Wigner's SU(4) symmetry is thus\na useful starting point for understanding tri-nucleon bound-state properties.\n", "  The formulation of Geometric Quantization contains several axioms and\nassumptions. We show that for real polarizations we can generalize the standard\ngeometric quantization procedure by introducing an arbitrary connection on the\npolarization bundle. The existence of reducible quantum structures leads to\nconsidering the class of Liouville symplectic manifolds. Our main application\nof this modified geometric quantization scheme is to Quantum Mechanics on\nRiemannian manifolds. With this method we obtain an energy operator without the\nscalar curvature term that appears in the standard formulation, thus agreeing\nwith the usual expression found in the Physics literature.\n", "  Following a newly introduced approach by Rasetti and Merelli we investigate\nthe possibility to extract topological information about the space where\ninteracting systems are modelled. From the statistical datum of their\nobservable quantities, like the correlation functions, we show how to\nreconstruct the activities of their constitutive parts which embed the\ntopological information. The procedure is implemented on a class of polymer\nmodels on hypergraphs with hard-core interactions. We show that the model\nfulfils a set of iterative relations for the partition function that generalise\nthose introduced by Heilmann and Lieb for the monomer-dimer case. After\ntranslating those relations into structural identities for the correlation\nfunctions we use them to test the precision and the robustness of the inverse\nproblem. Finally the possible presence of a further interaction of peer-to-peer\ntype is considered and a criterion to discover it is identified.\n", "  The charmonium spectrum is calculated with two nonrelativistic quark models,\nthe linear potential model and the screened potential model. Using the obtained\nwavefunctions, we evaluate the electromagnetic transitions of charmonium states\nup to $4S$ multiplet. The higher multipole contributions are included by a\nmultipole expansion of the electromagnetic interactions. Our results are in\nreasonable agreement with the measurements. As conventional charmonium states,\nthe radiative decay properties of the newly observed charmonium-like states,\nsuch as $X(3823)$, $X(3872)$, $X(4140/4274)$, are discussed. The $X(3823)$ as\n$\\psi_2(1D)$, its radiative decay properties well agree with the observations.\nFrom the radiative decay properties of $X(3872)$, one can not exclude it as a\n$\\chi_{c1}(2P)$ dominant state. We also give discussions of possibly observing\nthe missing charmonium states in radiative transitions, which might provide\nsome useful references to look for them in forthcoming experiments. The higher\nmultipole contributions to the electromagnetic transitions are analyzed as\nwell. It is found that the higher contribution from the magnetic part could\ngive notable corrections to some E1 dominant processes by interfering with the\nE1 amplitudes. Our predictions for the normalized magnetic quadrupole\namplitudes $M_2$ of the $\\chi_{c1,2}(1P)\\to J/\\psi \\gamma$ processes are in\ngood agreement with the recent CLEO measurements.\n", "  The top-antitop energy asymmetry is a promising observable of the charge\nasymmetry in jet-associated top-quark pair production at the LHC. We present\nnew predictions of the energy asymmetry in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV,\nincluding QCD corrections at the next-to-leading perturbative order. The effect\nof QCD corrections on the observable is moderate. With suitable phase-space\ncuts, the asymmetry can be enhanced at the cost of reducing the cross section.\nFor instance, for a cross section of $1\\,\\text{pb}$ after cuts, we predict an\nenergy asymmetry of $-6.5^{\\,+0.1}_{\\,-0.2}\\%$ at the next-to-leading order in\nQCD. We also investigate scale uncertainties and parton-shower effects, which\npartially cancel in the normalized asymmetry. Our results provide a sound basis\nfor a measurement of the energy asymmetry at the LHC during run II.\n", "  Motivated by the tensions in the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the structure\ngrowth $\\sigma_8$ between $Planck$ results and other low redshift measurements,\nwe discuss some cosmological effects of a dark sector model in which dark\nmatter (DM) interacts with fermionic dark radiation (DR) through a light gauge\nboson (dark photon). Such kind of models are very generic in particle physics\nwith a dark sector with dark gauge symmetries. The effective number of\nneutrinos is increased by $\\delta N_{eff} \\sim 0.5$ due to light dark photon\nand fermionic DR, thereby resolving the conflicts in $H_0$. The elastic\nscattering between DM and DR induces suppression for DM's density perturbation,\nbut without acoustic oscillations. For weakly-interacting DM around $100$GeV,\nthe new gauge coupling should be $\\sim 10^{-4}$ to have sizable effect on\nmatter power spectrum in order to relax the tension in $\\sigma_8$.\n", "  We study the statistics of human deaths from wars, conflicts, similar\nman-made conflicts as well as natural disasters. The probability distribution\nof number of people killed in natural disasters as well as man made situations\nshow power law decay for the largest sizes, with similar exponent values.\nComparisons with natural disasters, when event sizes are measured in terms of\nphysical quantities (e.g., energy released in earthquake, volume of rainfall,\nland area affected in forest fires, etc.) also show striking resemblances. The\nuniversal patterns in their statistics suggest that some subtle similarities in\ntheir mechanisms and dynamics might be responsible.\n", "  We study the impact of the non-analytic reconstruction of vortex cores on\nstatic vortex structures in weakly coupled superfluids. We show that in\nrotating two-dimensional systems, the Abrikosov vortex lattice is unstable to\nvortex core deformation: Each zero of the wave function becomes a cut of finite\nlength. The directors characterizing the orientations of the cuts are\nthemselves ordered in superstructures due either to surface effects or to\ninteraction with shear deformations of the lattice (spiral structure). Similar\ninstability may be also observable in clean superconducting films.\n", "  We study theoretically the possibilities of coupling the quantum mechanical\nmotion of a trapped charged particle (e.g. ion or electron) to quantum degrees\nof freedom of superconducting devices, nano-mechanical resonators and quartz\nbulk acoustic wave resonators. For each case, we estimate the coupling rate\nbetween the charged particle and its macroscopic counterpart and compare it to\nthe decoherence rate, i.e. the rate at which quantum superposition decays. A\nhybrid system can only be considered quantum if the coupling rate significantly\nexceeds all decoherence rates. Our approach is to examine specific examples,\nusing parameters that are experimentally attainable in the foreseeable future.\nWe conclude that those hybrid quantum system considered involving an atomic ion\nare unfavorable, compared to using an electron, since the coupling rates\nbetween the charged particle and its counterpart are slower than the expected\ndecoherence rates. A system based on trapped electrons, on the other hand,\nmight have coupling rates which significantly exceed decoherence rates.\nMoreover it might have appealing properties such as fast entangling gates, long\ncoherence and flexible electron interconnectivity topology. Realizing such a\nsystem, however, is technologically challenging, since it requires\naccommodating both trapping technology and superconducting circuitry in a\ncompatible manner. We review some of the challenges involved, such as the\nrequired trap parameters, electron sources, electrical circuitry and cooling\nschemes in order to promote further investigations towards the realization of\nsuch a hybrid system.\n", "  We apply the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm for the analysis of constraints to\ngauge theories defined on spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds. We find\nthat the constraints for a given theory are modified on such spacetimes through\nthe presence of additional contributions from the horizon. As a concrete\nexample, we consider the Maxwell field on a black hole background, and\ndetermine the role of the horizon contributions on the dynamics of the theory.\n", "  I propose a spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) measurement scheme for the\nfar-field imaging of spatially incoherent optical sources. For any object too\nsmall to be resolved by direct imaging under the diffraction limit, I show that\nSPADE can estimate its second or higher moments much more precisely than direct\nimaging can fundamentally do in the presence of photon shot noise. I also prove\nthat SPADE can approach the optimal precision allowed by quantum mechanics in\nestimating the location and scale parameters of a subdiffraction object.\nRealizable with far-field linear optics and photon counting, SPADE is expected\nto find applications in both fluorescence microscopy and astronomy.\n", "  Recent work has studied the growth of commutators as a probe of chaos and\ninformation scrambling in quantum many-body systems. In this work we study the\neffect of static disorder on the growth of commutators in a variety of\ncontexts. We find generically that disorder slows the onset of scrambling, and,\nin the case of a many-body localized state, partially halts it. We access the\nmany-body localized state using a standard fixed point Hamiltonian, and we show\nthat operators exhibit slow logarithmic growth under time evolution. We compare\nthe result with the expected growth of commutators in both localized and\ndelocalized non-interacting disordered models. Finally, based on a scaling\nargument, we state a conjecture about the effect of weak interactions on the\ngrowth of commutators in an interacting diffusive metal.\n", "  We study the effect of sputter-deposition conditions, namely substrate\ntemperature and chamber base pressure, upon the interface quality of epitaxial\nPt/Co/Pt thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Here we define\ninterface quality to be the inverse of the sum in quadrature of roughness and\nintermixing. We find that samples with the top Co/Pt layers grown at 250\ndegrees C exhibit a local maximum in roughness-intermixing and that the\ninterface quality is better for lower or higher deposition temperatures, up to\n400 degrees C, above which the interface quality degrades. Imaging the\nexpansion of magnetic domains in an in-plane field using wide-field Kerr\nmicroscopy, we determine the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) in films in the deposition temperature range 100 degrees C to 300 degrees\nC. The net DMI is linked to the difference in top and bottom Co interface\nqualities; the net DMI increases as the difference between top and bottom Co\ninterface quality increases. Furthermore, for sufficiently low base pressures,\nthe net DMI increases linearly with the deposition temperature, indicating that\nfine-tuning of the DMI may be achieved via the deposition conditions.\n", "  Bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) belong to a class of\nmaterials with two unique features, the coupled spin-valley-layer degrees of\nfreedom and the crystal structure that is globally centrosymmetric but locally\nnon-centrosymmetric. In this work, we will show that the combination of these\ntwo features can lead to a rich phase diagram for unconventional\nsuperconductivity, including intra-layer and inter-layer singlet pairings and\ninter-layer triplet pairings, in bilayer superconducting TMDs. In particular,\nwe predict that the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state can\nexist in bilayer TMDs under an in-plane magnetic field. We also discuss the\nexperimental relevance of our results and possible experimental signatures.\n", "  Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering we study under-doped,\noptimally-doped and over-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ samples in the\nnormal and superconducting states. We show that low-energy nematic fluctuations\nare universal for all studied doping range. In the superconducting state, we\nobserve two distinct superconducting pair breaking peaks corresponding to one\nlarge and one small superconducting gaps. In addition, we detect a collective\nmode below the superconducting transition in the B$_{2g}$ channel and determine\nthe evolution of its binding energy with doping. Possible scenarios are\nproposed to explain the origin of the in-gap collective mode. In the\nsuperconducting state of the under-doped regime, we detect a re-entrance\ntransition below which the spectral background changes and the collective mode\nvanishes.\n", "  We investigate the SU($2N$) symmetry effects with $2N>2$ on the\ntwo-dimensional interacting Dirac fermions at finite temperatures, including\nthe valence-bond-solid transition, the Pomeranchuk effect, the compressibility\nand the uniform spin susceptibility, by performing the determinant quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations of the half-filled SU($2N$) Hubbard model on a\nhoneycomb lattice. The columnar valence-bond-solid (cVBS) phase only breaks the\nthree-fold discrete symmetry, and thus can survive at finite temperatures. The\ndisordered phase in the weak coupling regime is the thermal Dirac semi-metal\nstate, while in the strong coupling regime it is largely a Mott state in which\nthe cVBS order is thermally melted. The calculated entropy-temperature\nrelations for various values of the Hubbard interaction $U$ show that, the\nPomeranchuk effect occurs when the specific entropy is below a characteristic\nvalue of $S^*$ --- the maximal entropy per particle from the spin channel of\nlocal moments. The SU($2N$) symmetry enhances the Pomeranchuk effect, which\nfacilitates the interaction-induced adiabatic cooling. Our work sheds new light\non future explorations of novel states of matter with ultra-cold large-spin\nalkaline fermions.\n", "  Chipscale microresonators with integrated planar optical waveguides are\nuseful building blocks for linear, nonlinear and quantum optical devices. Loss\nreduction through improving fabrication processes has resulted in several\nintegrated micro resonator platforms attaining quality (Q) factors of several\nmillions. However only few studies have investigated design-dependent losses,\nespecially with regard to the resonator coupling section. Here we investigate\ndesign-dependent parasitic losses, described by the coupling ideality, of the\ncommonly employed microresonator design consisting of a microring resonator\nwaveguide side-coupled to a straight bus waveguide. By systematic\ncharacterization of multi-mode high-Q silicon nitride microresonator devices,\nwe show that this design can suffer from low coupling ideality. By performing\nfull 3D simulations to numerically investigate the resonator to bus waveguide\ncoupling, we identify the coupling to higher-order bus waveguide modes as the\ndominant origin of parasitic losses which lead to the low coupling ideality.\nUsing suitably designed bus waveguides, parasitic losses are mitigated, and a\nnearly unity ideality and strong overcoupling (i.e. a ratio of external\ncoupling to internal resonator loss rate > 9) are demonstrated. Moreover we\nfind that different resonator modes can exchange power through the coupler,\nwhich therefore constitutes a mechanism that induces modal coupling, a\nphenomenon known to distort resonator dispersion properties. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential for significant performance improvements of\nintegrated planar microresonators, achievable by optimized coupler designs.\n", "  Topological orders can be used as media for topological quantum computing ---\na promising quantum computation model due to its invulnerability against local\nerrors. Conversely, a quantum simulator, often regarded as a quantum computing\ndevice for special purposes, also offers a way of characterizing topological\norders. Here, we show how to identify distinct topological orders via measuring\ntheir modular $S$ and $T$ matrices. In particular, we employ a nuclear magnetic\nresonance quantum simulator to study the properties of three topologically\nordered matter phases described by the string-net model with two string types,\nincluding the $\\Z_2$ toric code, doubled semion, and doubled Fibonacci. The\nthird one, non-Abelian Fibonacci order is notably expected to be the simplest\ncandidate for universal topological quantum computing. Our experiment serves as\nthe basic module, built on which one can simulate braiding of non-Abelian\nanyons and ultimately topological quantum computation via the braiding, and\nthus provides a new approach of investigating topological orders using quantum\ncomputers.\n", "  We show that observations of the core temperature of transiently-accreting\nneutron stars combined with observations of an accretion outburst give a lower\nlimit to the neutron star core heat capacity. For the neutron stars in the low\nmass X-ray binaries KS 1731-260, MXB 1659-29, and XTE J1701-462, we show that\nthe lower limit is a factor of a few below the core heat capacity expected if\nneutrons and protons in the core are paired, so that electrons provide the\ndominant contribution to the heat capacity. This limit rules out a core\ndominated by a quark color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, which would have a much\nlower heat capacity. Future observations of or limits on cooling during\nquiescence will further constrain the core heat capacity.\n", "  The second-order temporal interference of classical and nonclassical light at\nan asymmetrical beam splitter is discussed based on two-photon interference in\nFeynman's path integral theory. The visibility of the second-order interference\npattern is determined by the properties of the superposed light beams, the\nratio between the intensities of these two light beams, and the reflectivity of\nthe asymmetrical beam splitter. Some requirements about the asymmetrical beam\nsplitter have to be satisfied in order to ensure that the visibility of the\nsecond-order interference pattern of nonclassical light beams exceeds classical\nlimit. The visibility of the second-order interference pattern of photons\nemitted by two independent single-photon sources is independent of the ratio\nbetween the intensities. These conclusions are important for the researches and\napplications in quantum optics and quantum information when asymmetrical beam\nsplitter is employed.\n", "  Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging of Bogoliubov excitations in\nquasi-two dimensional unconventional superconductors has become a powerful\ntechnique for measuring the superconducting gap and its symmetry. Here, we\npresent the extension of this method to three-dimensional superconductors and\nanalyze the expected QPI spectrum for the two-component heavy fermion\nsuperconductor UPt$_3$ whose gap structure is still controversial. Starting\nfrom a 3D electronic structure and the three proposed chiral gap models\n$E_{1g,u}$ or $E_{2u}$, we perform a slab calculation that determines the 2D\ncontinuum Bogoliubov- de Gennes (BdG) surface quasiparticle bands and in\naddition the in-gap flat-band Andreev bound states that lead to surface Weyl\narcs connecting the projected gap nodes. Both features are very distinct for\nthe three models, in particular the most prominent $E_{2u}$ candidate is\nsingled out by the existence of {\\it two} Weyl arcs due to the double monopole\nnode points. The signature of these distinct surface bound and continuum states\nthat is left in QPI is derived and discussed. We show that it provides a\nfingerprint that may finally determine the true nodal structure of UPt$_3$\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Massive, Main-Sequence AF-type stars have so far remained unexplored in past\nradial velocity surveys, due to their small number of spectral lines and their\nhigh rotational velocities that prevent the classic RV computation method. Our\naim was to search for giant planets around AF MS stars, to get first\nstatistical information on their occurrence rate and to compare the results\nwith evolved stars and lower-mass MS stars. We used the HARPS spectrograph\nlocated on the 3.6m telescope at ESO La Silla Observatory to observe 108 AF MS\nstars with B-V in the -0.04 to 0.58 range and masses in the range 1.1-3.6 Msun.\nWe used our SAFIR software specifically developed to compute the radial\nvelocities of these early-type stars. We report the new detection of a mpsini =\n4.51 Mjup companion with a ~826-day period to the F6V dwarf HD111998. We\npresent new data on the 2-planet system around the F6IV-V dwarf HD60532. We\nalso report the detection of 14 binaries with long-term RV trends. 70% of our\ntargets show detection limits between 0.1 and 10 Mjup in the 1 to 10^3-day\nrange. We derive brown dwarf (13 < mpsini < 80 Mjup) occurrence rates in the 1\nto 10^3-day range of $2_{-2}^{+5}$% and $2.6_{-2.6}^{+6.7}$% for stars with\nmasses in the ranges 1.1-1.5 and 1.5-3 Msun, respectively. As for Jupiter-mass\ncompanions (1 < mpsini < 13 Mjup), we get occurrence rates in the 1 to 10^3-day\nrange of $4_{-0.9}^{+5.9}$% and $6.3_{-6.3}^{+15.9}$% respectively for the same\nstellar mass ranges. When considering the same Jupiter-mass companions but\nperiods in the 1 to 100-day range only, we get occurrence rates of\n$2_{-2}^{+5.2}$% and $3.9_{-3.9}^{+9.9}$%. Given the present error bars, these\nresults do not show a significant difference with companion frequencies derived\nfor solar-like stars.\n", "  Several time dependent backgrounds, with perfect fluid matter, can be used to\nconstruct solutions of Einstein equations in the presence of a negative\ncosmological constant along with some matter sources. In this work we focus on\nthe non-vacuum Kasner-AdS geometry and its solitonic generalization. To\ncharacterize these space-times, we provide ways to embed them in higher\ndimensional flat space-times. General space-like geodesics are then studied and\nused to compute the two point boundary correlators within the geodesic\napproximation.\n", "  We study quantum enhancement of transport in open systems in the presence of\ndisorder and dephasing. Quantum coherence effects may significantly enhance\ntransport in open systems even in the deep classical regime (where the\ndecoherence rate is greater than the inter-site hopping amplitude), as long as\nthe disorder is sufficiently strong. When the strengths of disorder and\ndephasing are fixed, there is an optimal opening strength at which the coherent\ntransport enhancement is optimized. Analytic results are obtained in two simple\nparadigmatic tight-binding models of large systems: the linear chain and the\nfully connected network. The physical behavior is also reflected in the FMO\nphotosynthetic complex, which may be viewed as intermediate between these\nparadigmatic models.\n", "  We study mixing in Stokesian vesicle suspensions in two dimensions on a\ncylindrical Couette apparatus using numerical simulations. The vesicle flow\nsimulation is done using a boundary integral method and the advection-diffusion\nequation for the mixing of the solute is solved using a pseudo-spectral scheme.\nWe study the effect of the area fraction, the viscosity contrast between the\ninside (the vesicles) and the outside (the bulk) fluid, the initial condition\nof the solute, and the mixing metric. We compare mixing in the suspension with\nmixing in the Couette apparatus without vesicles. On the one hand, the presence\nof vesicles in most cases, slightly suppresses mixing. This is because the\nsolute can be only diffused across the vesicle interface and not advected. On\nthe other hand, there exist spatial distributions of the solute for which the\nunperturbed Couette flow completely fails to mix whereas the presence of\nvesicles enables mixing. We derive a simple condition that relates the velocity\nand solute and can be used to characterize the cases in which the presence of\nvesicles promotes mixing.\n", "  The thermodynamical aspects of the conformal time scale factor duality (SFD)\nof cosmological models within Einstein Gravity are investigated. We derive the\nSFD transformations of the thermodynamical quantities describing the thermal\nevolution of the matter fluid and of the apparent horizon. The thermodynamical\nproperties of the self-dual cosmological models with a modified Chaplygin gas\nare studied in detail. We deduce the restrictions on the equation of state\nparameters that allow to extend scale factor duality as a UV/IR symmetry of the\ncosmological models consistent with their thermodynamical behavior.\n", "  The observation of spin-related phenomena of microcavity polaritons has been\nlimited due to weak Zeeman effect of non-magnetic semiconductors. We\ndemonstrate that the incorporation of magnetic ions into quantum wells placed\nin a non-magnetic microcavity results in enhanced effects of magnetic field on\nexciton-polaritons. We show that in such a structure the Zeeman splitting of\nexciton-polaritons strongly depends on the photon - exciton detuning and\npolariton wavevector. Our experimental data are explained by a model where the\nimpact of magnetic field on the lower polariton state is directly inherited\nfrom the excitonic component, and the coupling strength to cavity photon is\nmodified by external magnetic field.\n", "  We propose a new approach towards analytically solving for the dynamical\ncontent of Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) using the bootstrap philosophy. This\ncombines the original bootstrap idea of Polyakov with the modern technology of\nthe Mellin representation of CFT amplitudes. We employ exchange Witten diagrams\nwith built in crossing symmetry as our basic building blocks rather than the\nconventional conformal blocks in a particular channel. Demanding consistency\nwith the operator product expansion (OPE) implies an infinite set of\nconstraints on operator dimensions and OPE coefficients. We illustrate the\npower of this method in the epsilon expansion of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point\nby reproducing anomalous dimensions and, strikingly, obtaining OPE coefficients\nto higher orders in epsilon than currently available using other analytic\ntechniques (including Feynman diagram calculations). Our results enable us to\nget a somewhat better agreement of certain observables in the 3d Ising model,\nwith the precise numerical values that have been recently obtained.\n", "  Recent studies of cooled oil emulsion droplets uncovered transformations into\na host of flattened shapes with straight edges and sharp corners, driven by a\npartial phase transition of the bulk liquid phase. Here, we explore\ntheoretically the simplest geometric competition between this phase transition\nand surface tension in planar polygons, and recover the observed sequence of\nshapes and their statistics in qualitative agreement with experiments.\nExtending the model to capture some of the three-dimensional structure of the\ndroplets, we analyze the evolution of protrusions sprouting from the vertices\nof the platelets and the topological transition of a puncturing planar polygon.\n", "  We propose a method to entangle two distant vibrating microsize mirrors\n(i.e., mechanical oscillators) in a cavity optomechanical system. In this\nscheme, we discuss both the resonant and large-detuning conditions, and show\nthat the entanglement of two mechanical oscillators can be achieved with the\nassistance of a two-level atom and cavity-radiation pressure. In the resonant\ncase, the operation time is relatively short, which is desirable to minimize\nthe effects of decoherence. While in the large-detuning case, the cavity is\nonly virtually excited during the interaction. Therefore, the decay of the\ncavity is effectively suppressed, which makes the efficient decoherence time of\nthe cavity to be greatly prolonged. Thus, we observe that this virtual-photon\nprocess of microscopic objects may induce the entanglement of macroscopic\nobjects. Moreover, in both cases, the generation of entanglement is\ndeterministic and no measurements on the atom and the cavity are required.\nThese are experimentally important. Finally, the decoherence effect and the\nexperimental feasibility of the proposal are briefly discussed.\n", "  We construct gravitational modifications that go beyond Horndeski, namely\ntheories with extended nonminimal derivative couplings, in which the\ncoefficient functions depend not only on the scalar field but also on its\nkinetic energy. Such theories prove to be ghost-free in a cosmological\nbackground. We investigate the early-time cosmology and show that a de Sitter\ninflationary phase can be realized as a pure result of the novel gravitational\ncouplings. Additionally, we study the late-time evolution, where we obtain an\neffective dark energy sector which arises from the scalar field and its\nextended couplings to gravity. We extract various cosmological observables and\nanalyse their behavior at small redshifts for three choices of potentials,\nnamely, for the exponential, the power-law, and the Higgs potential. We show\nthat the Universe passes from deceleration to acceleration in the recent\ncosmological past, while the effective dark-energy equation-of-state parameter\ntends to the cosmological-constant value at present. Finally, the effective\ndark energy can be phantom-like, although the scalar field is canonical, which\nis an advantage of the model.\n", "  Brane brick models are Type IIA brane configurations that encode the $2d$\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ gauge theories on the worldvolume of D1-branes probing\ntoric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We use mirror symmetry to improve our understanding\nof this correspondence and to provide a systematic approach for constructing\nbrane brick models starting from geometry. The mirror configuration consists of\nD5-branes wrapping 4-spheres and the gauge theory is determined by how they\nintersect. We also explain how $2d$ $(0,2)$ triality is realized in terms of\ngeometric transitions in the mirror geometry. Mirror symmetry leads to a\ngeometric unification of dualities in different dimensions, where the order of\nduality is $n-1$ for a Calabi-Yau $n$-fold. This makes us conjecture the\nexistence of a quadrality symmetry in $0d$. Finally, we comment on how the\nM-theory lift of brane brick models connects to the classification of $2d$\n$(0,2)$ theories in terms of 4-manifolds.\n", "  We investigate numerically the momentum correlations in a two dimensional,\nharmonically trapped interacting Bose system at $T=0$ temperature, by using a\nparticle number preserving Bogoliubov approximation. Due to particle number\nconservation, interaction induced quantum fluctuations of the quasi-condensate\nlead to a large anti-correlation dip between particles of wave numbers\n$\\mathbf{k}$ and $-\\mathbf{k}$ for $|\\mathbf{k}|\\sim 1/R_c$, with $R_c$ typical\nsize of the condensate. The anti-correlation dip found is a clear fingerprint\nof coherent quantum fluctuations of the condensate. In contrast, for larger\nwave numbers, $|\\mathbf{k}| >> 1/R_c$, a weak positive correlation is found\nbetween particles of wave numbers $\\mathbf{k}$ and $-\\mathbf{k}$, in accordance\nwith the Bogoliubov result for homogeneous interacting systems.\n", "  Silicides are used extensively in nano- and microdevices due to their low\nelectrical resistivity, low contact resistance to silicon, and their process\ncompatibility. In this work, the thermal interface conductance of TiSi$_2$,\nCoSi$_2$, NiSi and PtSi are studied using time-domain thermoreflectance.\nExploiting the fact that most silicides formed on Si(111) substrates grow\nepitaxially, while most silicides on Si(100) do not, we study the effect of\nepitaxy, and show that for a wide variety of interfaces there is no difference\nin the thermal interface conductance of epitaxial and non-epitaxial\nsilicide/silicon interfaces. The effect of substrate carrier concentration is\nalso investigated over a wide range of p- and n-type doping, and is found to be\nindependent of carrier concentration, regardless of whether the interface is\nepitaxial and regardless of silicide type. In the case of epitaxial CoSi$_2$, a\ncomparison of temperature dependant experimental data is made with two detailed\ncomputational models using (1) full-dispersion diffuse mismatch modeling (DMM)\nincluding the effect of near-interfacial strain and (2) an atomistic Green'\nfunction (AGF) approach that integrates near-interface changes in the\ninteratomic force constants obtained through density functional perturbation\ntheory. At temperatures above 100K, the AGF approach greatly underpredicts the\nCoSi$_2$ data, while the DMM prediction matches the data well. The\nfull-dispersion DMM is also found to closely predict the experimentally\nobserved temperature-dependent interface conductance for epitaxial NiSi/Si and\nnon-epitaxial TiSi$_2$/Si interfaces. In the case of epitaxial PtSi/Si\ninterfaces, full dispersion DMM significantly overpredicts the experimental\ndata.\n", "  We introduce multi-pulse quantum noise spectroscopy protocols for spectral\nestimation of the noise affecting multiple qubits coupled to Gaussian dephasing\nenvironments including both classical and quantum sources. Our protocols are\ncapable of reconstructing all the noise auto- and cross-correlation spectra\nentering the multiqubit dynamics. We argue that this capability is crucial not\nonly for metrological purposes, as it provides access to the asymmetric spectra\nassociated with non-classical environments, but ultimately for achieving\nquantum fault-tolerance, as it enables the characterization of bath correlation\nfunctions. Our result relies on (i) an exact analytic solution for the reduced\nmultiqubit dynamics that holds in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian\nenvironment and dephasing-preserving control; (ii) the use of specific timing\nsymmetries in the control, which allow for a frequency comb to be engineered\nfor all filter functions of interest, and for the spectra to be related to\nexperimentally accessible qubit observables. We show that quantum spectra have\ndistinctive dynamical signatures, which we explore in two paradigmatic\nopen-system models describing spin and charge qubits coupled to bosonic\nenvironments. Complete multiqubit noise spectroscopy is demonstrated\nnumerically in a realistic setting consisting of two-exciton qubits coupled to\na phonon bath. The estimated spectra allow us to accurately predict the exciton\ndynamics as well as extract the temperature and spectral density of the quantum\nenvironment.\n", "  We study cosmological constraints on dark pure Yang-Mills sectors. Dark\nglueballs are overproduced for large regions of ultraviolet parameter space.\nThe problem may be alleviated in two ways: via a large preferential reheating\ninto the visible sector, motivating certain inflation or modulus decay models,\nor via decays into axions or moduli, which are strongly constrained by\nnucleosynthesis and $\\Delta N_{\\text{eff}}$ bounds. String models frequently\nhave multiple hidden Yang-Mills sectors, which are subject to even stronger\nconstraints due to the existence of multiple dark glueballs.\n", "  We propose a novel particle physics model in which vector dark matter (VDM)\nand dark radiation (DR) originate from the same non-Abelian dark sector. We\nshow an illustrating example where dark $SU(3)$ is spontaneously broken into\n$SU(2)$ subgroup by the nonzero vacuum expectation value of a complex scalar in\nfundamental representation of $SU(3)$. The massless gauge bosons associated\nwith the residual unbroken $SU(2)$ constitute DR and help to relieve the\ntension in Hubble constant measurements between $\\textit{Planck}$ and Hubble\nSpace Telescope. In the meantime, massive dark gauge bosons associated with the\nbroken generators are VDM candidates. Intrinsically, this non-Abelian VDM can\ninteract with non-Abelian DR in the cosmic background, which results in a\nsuppressed matter power spectrum and leads to a smaller $\\sigma_8$ for\nstructure formation.\n", "  We introduce a factorization of the fermion determinant in lattice QCD with\nWilson-type fermions that leads to a bosonic action which is local in the block\nfields. The interaction among gauge fields on distant blocks is mediated by\nmultiboson fields located on the boundaries of the blocks. The resultant\nmultiboson domain-decomposed hybrid Monte Carlo passes extensive numerical\ntests carried out by measuring standard gluonic observables. The combination of\nthe determinant factorization and of the one of the propagator, that we put\nforward recently, paves the way for multilevel Monte Carlo integration in the\npresence of fermions. We test this possibility by computing the disconnected\ncorrelator of two flavor-diagonal pseudoscalar densities, and we observe a\nsignificant increase of the signal-to-noise ratio due to a two-level\nintegration.\n", "  In this work, we use a combination of first-principles calculations under the\ndensity functional theory framework and heat transport simulations using the\natomistic Green's function (AGF) method to quantitatively predict the\ncontribution of the different scattering mechanisms to the thermal interface\nconductance of epitaxial CoSi$_2$-Si interfaces. An important development in\nthe present work is the direct computation of interfacial bonding from density\nfunctional perturbation theory (DFPT) and hence the avoidance of commonly used\n`mixing rules' to obtain the cross-interface force constants from bulk material\nforce constants. Another important algorithmic development is the integration\nof the recursive Green's function (RGF) method with B\\\"{u}ttiker probe\nscattering that enables computationally efficient simulations of inelastic\nphonon scattering and its contribution to the thermal interface conductance.\nFirst-principles calculations of electron-phonon coupling reveal that\ncross-interface energy transfer between metal electrons and atomic vibrations\nin the semiconductor is mediated by delocalized acoustic phonon modes that\nextend on both sides of the interface, and phonon modes that are localized\ninside the semiconductor region of the interface exhibit negligible coupling\nwith electrons in the metal. We also provide a direct comparison between\nsimulation predictions and experimental measurements of thermal interface\nconductance of epitaxial CoSi$_2$-Si interfaces using the time-domain\nthermoreflectance technique. Importantly, the experimental results, performed\nacross a wide temperature range, only agree well with predictions that include\nall transport processes: elastic and inelastic phonon scattering,\nelectron-phonon coupling in the metal, and electron-phonon coupling across the\ninterface.\n", "  CMB Stage-4 experiments will reduce the uncertainties on the gravitational\nlensing potential by an order of magnitude compared to current measurements,\nand will also produce a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster catalog containing\n$\\sim10^{5}$ objects, two orders of magnitudes higher than what is currently\navailable. In this paper we propose to combine these two observables and show\nthat it is possible to calibrate the masses of the full Stage-4 cluster catalog\ninternally owing to the high signal to noise measurement of the CMB lensing\nconvergence field. We find that a CMB Stage-4 experiment will constrain the\nhydrostatic bias parameter to sub-percent accuracy. We also show constraints on\na non parametric $Y-M$ relationship which could be used to study its evolution\nwith mass and redshift. Finally we present a joint likelihood for thermal SZ\n(tSZ) flux and mass measurements, and show that it could lead to a\n$\\sim5\\sigma$ detection of the lower limit on the sum of the neutrino masses in\nthe normal hierarchy ($\\sum m_{\\nu}=60 \\textrm{meV}$) once combined with\nmeasurements of the primordial CMB and CMB lensing power spectra.\n", "  Recently the $B$ factories BaBar and Belle as well as the LHCb experiment\nhave reported several anomalies in the semileptonic $B$ meson decays such as\n$R_{K}$ and $R_{D^{(*)}}$ etc. We investigate these deviations by considering\nthe vector leptoquarks relevant for both $b \\to s l^+ l^-$ and $b \\to c l \\bar\n\\nu_l$ transitions. The leptoquark parameter space is constrained by using the\nexperimentally measured branching ratios of $B_s \\to l^+ l^-$, $\\bar B \\to X_s\nl^+ l^- (\\nu \\bar \\nu)$ and $B_u^+ \\to l^+ \\nu_l$ processes. Using the\nconstrained leptoquark couplings, we compute the branching ratios,\nforward-backward asymmetries, $\\tau$ and $D^*$ polarization parameters in the\n$\\bar B \\to D^{(*)} l \\bar \\nu_l$ processes. We find that the vector\nleptoquarks can explain both $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $R_K$ anomalies simultaneously.\nFurthermore, we study the rare leptonic $B_{u, c}^* \\to l \\bar\\nu$ decay\nprocesses in this model.\n", "  We suggest here the method of the mapping of DFT calculations on the\nmultiorbital model in a following way: the parameters of the formulated\nmultiorbital model should be determined from the requirement that the\nself-consistent charge and spin densities found from the ab initio and model\ncalculations have to be as close to each other as possible. The analysis of the\nmodel allows for detailed understanding of the role played by different\nparameters of the model in the physics of interest. As an example of the\napproach we present the study of the effect of silicon atoms substitution by\nthe iron atoms and vice versa on the magnetic properties in the iron silicide\nalpha-FeSi2. The DFT+GGA calculations are mapped to the model with intraatomic\nCoulomb and exchange interactions, hoppings to nearest and next nearest atoms\nand exchange of the delocalized electrons between iron atoms; the magnetic\nmoments on atoms and charge densities of the material are found\nself-consistently within the Hartree-Fock approximation. We find that while the\nstoichiometric alpha-FeSi2 is nonmagnetic, the substitutions generate different\nmagnetic structures. For example, the substitution of three Si atoms by the Fe\natoms results in the ferrimagnetic structure whereas the substitution of four\nSi atoms by Fe atoms gives rise to either the nonmagnetic or the ferromagnetic\nstate depending on the type of local enviroment of the substitutional Fe atoms.\nBesides, contrary to the commonly accepted statement that the destruction of\nthe magnetic moment is controlled only by the number of Fe-Si nearest\nneighbors, we find that actually it is controlled by the Fe-Fe\nnext-nearest-neighbors. This finding led us to the counterintuitive conclusion:\nan increase of Si concentration in Fe1-xSi2+x ordered alloys may lead to a\nferromagnetism. This conclusion is confirmed by the calculation within\nGGA-to-DFT.\n", "  In this work, we propose a cosmological scenario inherently based on the\neffective Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that cosmic inflation and dark matter\ncan be successfully described by a single framework. On the one hand, the\nscalar channel of the NJL model plays a role of the composite inflaton (CI) and\nwe show that it is viable to achieve successful inflation via a non-minimal\ncoupling to gravity. For model of inflation, we compute the inflationary\nparameters and confront them with recent Planck 2015 data. We discover that the\npredictions of the model are in excellent agreement with the Planck analysis.\nWe also present in our model a simple connection of physics from the high\nscales to low scales via renormalization group equations of the physical\nparameters. On the other hand, the pseudoscalar channel can be assigned as a\ncandidate for composite dark matter (CD). For model of dark matter, we couple\nthe pseudoscalar to the Higgs sector of the standard model with the coupling\nstrength $\\kappa$ and estimate its thermally-averaged relic abundance. We\ndiscover that the CD mass is strongly sensitive to the coupling $\\kappa$. We\nfind in case of light CD, $M_{s}<M_{h}/2$, that the required relic abundance is\narchived for value of its mass $M_{s} \\sim 61\\,{\\rm GeV}$ for $\\kappa=0.1$.\nHowever, in this case the CD mass can be lighter when the coupling is getting\nlarger. Moreover, in case of heavy CD, $M_{s}> M_{W,\\,Z}$ (or $>M_{h}$), the\nrequired relic abundance can be satisfied for value of the CD mass $M_{s}\\sim\n410\\,{\\rm GeV}$ for $\\kappa = 0.5$. In contradiction to the light mass case,\nhowever, the CD mass in this case can even be heavier when the coupling is\ngetting larger.\n", "  We define a (semi-classical) path integral for gravity with Neumann boundary\nconditions in $D$ dimensions, and show how to relate this new partition\nfunction to the usual picture of Euclidean quantum gravity. We also write down\nthe action in ADM Hamiltonian formulation and use it to reproduce the entropy\nof black holes and cosmological horizons. A comparison between the\n(background-subtracted) covariant and Hamiltonian ways of semi-classically\nevaluating this path integral in flat space reproduces the generalized Smarr\nformula and the first law. This \"Neumann ensemble\" perspective on gravitational\nthermodynamics is parallel to the canonical (Dirichlet) ensemble of\nGibbons-Hawking and the microcanonical approach of Brown-York.\n", "  We carry out a throughout study of the topological Hall and topological spin\nHall effects in disordered skyrmionic systems: the dimensionless (spin) Hall\nangles are evaluated across the energy band structure in the multiprobe\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism and their link to the effective magnetic field\nemerging from the real space topology of the spin texture is highlighted. We\ndiscuss these results for an optimal skyrmion size and for various sizes of the\nsample and found that the adiabatic approximation still holds for large\nskyrmions as well as for few atomic size-nanoskyrmions. Finally, we test the\nrobustness of the topological signals against disorder strength and show that\ntopological Hall effect is highly sensitive to momentum scattering.\n", "  We study the unique physical properties of topological nodal-loop semimetals\nprotected by the coexistence of time-reversal and inversion symmetries with\nnegligible spin-orbit coupling. We argue that strong correlation effects occur\nat the surface of such systems for relatively small Hubbard interaction $U$,\ndue to the narrow bandwidth of the \"drumhead\" surface states. In the\nHartree-Fock approximation, at small $U$ we obtain a surface ferromagnetic\nphase through a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the\nsurface-mode divergence of the spin susceptibility, while the bulk states\nremain very robust against local interactions and remain non-ordered. At\nslightly increased interaction strength, the system quickly changes from a\nsurface ferromagnetic phase to a surface charge-ordered phase through a\nfirst-order transition. When Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling is applied to the\nsurface states, a canted ferromagnetic phase occurs at the surface for\nintermediate values of $U$. The quantum critical behavior of the surface\nferromagnetic transition is nontrivial in the sense that the surface spin order\nparameter couple to Fermi-surface excitations from both surface and bulk\nstates. This leads to unconventional Landau damping and consequently a na\\\"ive\ndynamical critical exponent $z\\!\\approx\\!1$ when the Fermi level is close to\nthe bulk nodal energy. We also show that, already without interactions, quantum\noscillations arise due to bulk states, despite the absence of a Fermi surface\nwhen the chemical potential is tuned to the energy of the nodal loop. The bulk\nmagnetic susceptibility diverges logarithmically whenever the nodal loop\nexactly overlaps with a quantized magnetic orbit in the bulk Brillouin zone.\nThese correlation and transport phenomena are unique signatures of nodal loop\nstates.\n", "  We calculate the sensitivity to a circular polarization of an isotropic\nstochastic gravitational wave background (ISGWB) as a function of frequency for\nground- and space-based interferometers and observations of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. The origin of a circularly polarized ISGWB may be due to\nexotic primordial physics (i.e., parity violation in the early universe) and\nmay be strongly frequency dependent. We present calculations within a coherent\nframework which clarifies the basic requirements for sensitivity to circular\npolarization, in distinction from previous work which focused on each of these\ntechniques separately. We find that the addition of an interferometer with the\nsensitivity of the Einstein Telescope in the southern hemisphere improves the\nsensitivity of the ground-based network to circular polarization by about a\nfactor of two. The sensitivity curves presented in this paper make clear that\nthe wide range in frequencies of current and planned observations ($10^{-18}\\\n{\\rm Hz} \\lesssim f \\lesssim 100\\ {\\rm Hz}$) will be critical to determining\nthe physics that underlies any positive detection of circular polarization in\nthe ISGWB. We also identify a desert in circular polarization sensitivity for\nfrequencies between $10^{-15}\\ {\\rm Hz} \\lesssim f \\lesssim 10^{-3}\\ {\\rm Hz}$,\ngiven the inability for pulsar timing arrays and indirect-detection methods to\ndistinguish the gravitational wave polarization.\n", "  We investigate the decay of 87Br, 88Br and 94Rb using total absorption\ngamma-ray spectroscopy. These important fission products are beta-delayed\nneutron emitters. Our data show considerable gamma-intensity, so far unobserved\nin high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, from states at high excitation\nenergy. We also find significant differences with the beta intensity that can\nbe deduced from existing measurements of the beta spectrum. We evaluate the\nimpact of the present data on reactor decay heat using summation calculations.\nAlthough the effect is relatively small it helps to reduce the discrepancy\nbetween calculations and integral measurements of the photon component for 235U\nfission at cooling times in the range 1 to 100 s. We also use summation\ncalculations to evaluate the impact of present data on reactor antineutrino\nspectra. We find a significant effect at antineutrino energies in the range of\n5 to 9 MeV. In addition, we observe an unexpected strong probability for gamma\nemission from neutron unbound states populated in the daughter nucleus. The\ngamma branching is compared to Hauser-Feshbach calculations which allow one to\nexplain the large value for bromine isotopes as due to nuclear structure.\nHowever the branching for 94Rb, although much smaller, hints of the need to\nincrease the radiative width by one order-of-magnitude. This leads to a similar\nincrease in the calculated (n,gamma) cross section for this very neutron-rich\nnucleus with a potential impact on r-process abundance calculations.\n", "  Focusing with a 4$\\pi$ parabolic mirror allows for concentrating light from\nnearly the complete solid angle, whereas focusing with a single microscope\nobjective limits the angle cone used for focusing to half solid angle at\nmaximum. Increasing the solid angle by using deep parabolic mirrors comes at\nthe cost of adding more complexity to the mirror's fabrication process and\nmight introduce errors that reduce the focusing quality. To determine these\nerrors, we experimentally examine the focusing properties of a 4$\\pi$ parabolic\nmirror that was produced by single-point diamond turning. The properties are\ncharacterized with a single $^{174}$Yb$^{+}$ ion as a mobile point scatterer.\nThe ion is trapped in a vacuum environment with a movable high optical access\nPaul trap. We demonstrate an effective focal spot size of 209 nm in lateral and\n551 nm in axial direction. Such tight focusing allows us to build an efficient\nlight-matter interface. Our findings agree with numerical simulations\nincorporating a finite ion temperature and interferometrically measured\nwavefront aberrations induced by the parabolic mirror. We point at further\ntechnological improvements and discuss the general scope of applications of a\n4$\\pi$ parabolic mirror.\n", "  A novel, information-based classification of elementary cellular automata is\nproposed that circumvents the problems associated with isolating whether\ncomplexity is in fact intrinsic to a dynamical rule, or if it arises merely as\na product of a complex initial state. Transfer entropy variations processed by\nthe system split the 256 elementary rules into three information classes, based\non sensitivity to initial conditions. These classes form a hierarchy such that\ncoarse-graining transitions observed among elementary cellular automata rules\npredominately occur within each information- based class, or much more rarely,\ndown the hierarchy.\n", "  In the standard model extended with a seesaw mass matrix, we study the\nproduction of sterile neutrinos from the decay of vector bosons at $T\\simeq\nM_{W,Z}$. We derive a general quantum kinetic equation for the production of\nsterile neutrinos and their effective mixing angles valid in a wide range of\ntemperature, to all orders in interactions of the standard model, and to\nleading order mixing angle $\\theta \\ll 1$.\n  Production rates and effective mixing angles depend sensitively on helicity.\nPositive helicity states interact more weakly with the medium and their\neffective mixing angle is not modified significantly whereas the mixing angle\nfor negative helicity is strongly suppressed by the medium.\n  If $M_s \\lesssim 8.35\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, there are fewer states with negative\nhelicity produced than those with positive helicity. There is an MSW resonance\nin the absence of lepton asymmetry, but is screened by the damping rate,\nwithout production enhancement. Negative helicity states freeze-out at\n$T^-_f\\simeq 5\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ and positive helicity states freeze-out at $T^+_f\n\\simeq 8\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, both distributions are far from thermal. Negative\nhelicity states feature a broader momentum distribution than that for those\nwith positive helicity. Sterile neutrinos produced via vector boson decay do\nnot satisfy the abundance, lifetime and cosmological constraints to be the sole\ndark matter component in the universe but might solve the $^{7}Li$ problem,\nalbeit at the very edge of the possible parameter space. A heavy sterile\nneutrino with a mass of a few MeV could decay into light sterile neutrinos, of\na few keV in mass, that contribute to warm dark matter. We argue that heavy\nsterile neutrinos with lifetime $\\leq 1/H_0$ reach local thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\n", "  Planar microcavities allow the control and manipulation of spin-polarization,\nmanifested in phenomena like the optical spin Hall effect due to the intrinsic\npolarization mode splitting. Here, we study a transparent microcavity with\nbroken rotational symmetry, realized by aligning the optical axis of a uniaxial\ncavity material in the cavity plane. We demonstrate that the in-plane optical\nanisotropy gives rise to exceptional points in the dispersion relation, which\noccur pair-wise, are circularly polarized, and are cores of polarization\nvortices. These exceptional points are a result of the non-Hermitian character\nof the system, and are in close relationship to singular optical axes in\nabsorptive biaxial systems.\n", "  Quantum corrections to charge transport can give rise to an oscillatory\nmagnetoconductance, typically observed in mesoscopic samples with a length\nshorter than or comparable with the phase coherence length. Here, we report the\nobservation of magnetoconductance oscillations periodic in magnetic field with\nan amplitude of the order of $e^2/h$ in macroscopic samples of Highly Oriented\nPyrolytic Graphite (HOPG). The observed effect emerges when all carriers are\nconfined to their lowest Landau levels. We argue that this quantum interference\nphenomenon can be explained by invoking moir\\'e superlattices with a discrete\ndistribution in periodicity. According to our results, when the magnetic length\n$\\ell_B$, the Fermi wave length $\\lambda_F$ and the length scale of\nfluctuations in local chemical potential are comparable in a layered conductor,\nquantum corrections can be detected over centimetric length scales.\n", "  Third generation ground-based interferometers as well as the planned\nspace-based interferometer LISA are expected to detect a plethora of\ngravitational wave signals from coalescing binaries at cosmological distance.\nThe emitted gravitational waves propagate in the expanding universe through the\ninhomogeneous distribution of matter. Here we show that the acceleration of the\nuniverse and the peculiar acceleration of the binary with respect to the\nobserver distort the gravitational chirp signal from the simplest General\nRelativity prediction beyond a mere time independent rescaling of the chirp\nmass, affecting intrinsic parameter estimations for the binaries visible by\nLISA. We find that the effect due to the peculiar acceleration can be much\nlarger than the one due to the universe acceleration. Moreover, peculiar\naccelerations can introduce a bias in the estimation of parameters such as the\ntime of coalescence and the individual masses of the binary. An error in the\nestimation of the arrival time will have an impact in the case of sources\nvisible first by LISA and later by ground based interferometers.\n", "  We report first-principles calculations for one of the few materials that is\nbelieved to be a ferroelectric ferromagnet, Bi$_2$NiMnO$_6$. Our calculations\nshow that, contrary to what it has been reported so far, bulk Bi$_2$NiMnO$_6$\ndoes not have a polarization. Instead, like BiMnO$_3$, it crystallizes into a\ncentrosymmetric structure with space group $C2/c$. We also predict that\nBi$_2$NiMnO$_6$ will indeed be a ferroelectric ferromagnet if it is grown as an\nepitaxial film on a substrate with in-plane square symmetry and a lattice\nconstant around 4~\\AA, such as BaTiO$_3$ or PbZr$_{1-x}$Ti$_{x}$O$_{3}$.\n", "  We calculate the mass spectra of the singly charmed baryons\n($\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$, $\\Sigma_{c}^{0}$, $\\Xi_{c}^{0}$ and $\\Omega_{c}^{0}$) using\nHypercentral constituent quark model(hCQM). The hyper color coloumb plus linear\npotential is used to calculate the masses of positive(upto\n$J^{p}=\\frac{7}{2}^{+}$) and negative parity(upto $J^{p}=\\frac{9}{2}^{-}$)\nexcited states. The spin-spin, spin-orbital and tensor interaction terms are\nalso incorporated for mass spectra. We have compared our results with other\ntheoretical predictions and Lattice QCD for each baryons. Moreover, the known\nexperimental results are also reasonably closed to our predicted masses. By\nusing the radial and orbital excitation, we construct Regge trajectories for\nthe baryons in (n,$M^{2}$) plane and find their slopes and intercepts. The\nother properties like, magnetic moments, radiative transitions and radiative\ndecay widths of these baryons are also calculated successfully.\n", "  We study the interplay of particle-hole symmetry and fermion-vortex duality\nin multicomponent half-filled Landau levels, such as quantum Hall gallium\narsenide bilayers and graphene. For the $\\nu{=}1/2{+}1/2$ bilayer, we show that\nparticle-hole-symmetric interlayer Cooper pairing of composite fermions leads\nto precisely the same phase as the electron exciton condensate realized in\nexperiments. This equivalence is easily understood by applying the recent Dirac\nfermion formulation of $\\nu{=}1/2$ to two components. It can also be described\nby Halperin-Lee-Read composite fermions undergoing interlayer $p_x{+}ip_y$\npairing. An RG analysis showing strong instability to interlayer pairing at\nlarge separation $d\\rightarrow \\infty$ demonstrates that two\ninitially-decoupled composite Fermi liquids can be smoothly tuned into the\nconventional bilayer exciton condensate without encountering a phase\ntransition. We also discuss multicomponent systems relevant to graphene, derive\nrelated phases including a $Z_2$ gauge theory with spin-half visons, and argue\nfor symmetry-enforced gaplessness under full SU$(N_f)$ flavor symmetry when the\nnumber of components $N_f$ is even.\n", "  The radiation of stars heats dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium\nand in star-forming regions in galaxies. Modelling this interaction provides\ninformation on dust in galaxies, a vital ingredient for their evolution. It is\nnot straightforward to identify the stellar populations heating the dust, and\nto link attenuation to emission on a sub-galactic scale. Radiative transfer\nmodels are able to simulate this dust-starlight interaction in a realistic,\nthree-dimensional setting. We investigate the dust heating mechanisms on a\nlocal and global galactic scale, using the Andromeda galaxy (M31) as our\nlaboratory. We perform a series of panchromatic radiative transfer simulations\nof Andromeda with our code SKIRT. The high inclination angle of M31 complicates\nthe 3D modelling and causes projection effects. However, the observed\nmorphology and flux density are reproduced fairly well from UV to\nsub-millimeter wavelengths. Our model reveals a realistic attenuation curve,\ncompatible with previous, observational estimates. We find that the dust in M31\nis mainly (91 % of the absorbed luminosity) heated by the evolved stellar\npopulations. The bright bulge produces a strong radiation field and induces\nnon-local heating up to the main star-forming ring at 10 kpc. The relative\ncontribution of unevolved stellar populations to the dust heating varies\nstrongly with wavelength and with galactocentric distance.The dust heating\nfraction of unevolved stellar populations correlates strongly with NUV-r colour\nand specific star formation rate. These two related parameters are promising\nprobes for the dust heating sources at a local scale.\n", "  We present a detailed study of magnetic reconnection in a\nquasi-two-dimensional pulsed-power driven laboratory experiment. Oppositely\ndirected magnetic fields $(B=3$ T), advected by supersonic, sub-Alfv\\'enic\ncarbon plasma flows $(V_{in}=50$ km/s), are brought together and mutually\nannihilate inside a thin current layer ($\\delta=0.6$ mm). Temporally and\nspatially resolved optical diagnostics, including interferometry, Faraday\nrotation imaging and Thomson scattering, allow us to determine the structure\nand dynamics of this layer, the nature of the inflows and outflows and the\ndetailed energy partition during the reconnection process. We measure high\nelectron and ion temperatures $(T_e=100$ eV, $T_i=600$ eV), far in excess of\nwhat can be attributed to classical (Spitzer) resistive and viscous\ndissipation. We observe the repeated formation and ejection of plasmoids, which\nwe interpret as evidence of two-fluid effects in our experiment.\n", "  A model of a clean two-band s-wave superconductor with cylindrical Fermi\nsurfaces, different Fermi velocities v_{1,2}, and a general 2x2 coupling matrix\nV_{alpha beta} is used to study the order parameter distribution in vortex\nlattices. The Eilenberger weak coupling formalism is used to calculate\nnumerically the spatial distributions of the pairing amplitudes Delta_1_ and\nDelta_2_ of the two bands for vortices parallel to the Fermi cylinders. For\ngeneric values of the interband coupling V_{12}, it is shown that,\nindependently of the couplings V_{alpha beta}, of the ratio v_1 /v_2, of the\ntemperature, and the applied field, the length scales of spatial variation of\nDelta_1 and of Delta_2 are the same within the accuracy of our calculations.\nThe only exception from this single length-scale behavior is found for V_{12}\n--> 0, i.e., for nearly decoupled bands.\n", "  The great obstacle for practical applications of the quantum anomalous Hall\n(QAH) effect is the lack of suitable QAH materials (Chern insulators) with\nlarge non-trivial band gap, room-temperature magnetic order and high carrier\nmobility. The Nickle chloride (NiCl3) monolayer characteristics are\ninvestigated herein using first-principles calculations. It is reported that\nNiCl3 monolayers constitute a new class of Dirac materials with Dirac\nspin-gapless semiconducting and high-temperature ferromagnetism (~400K). Taking\ninto account the spin-orbit coupling, the NiCl3 monolayer becomes an intrinsic\ninsulator with a large non-trivial band gap of ~24 meV, corresponding to an\noperating temperature as high as ~280K at which the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect could be observed. The calculated large non-trivial gap, high Curie\ntemperature and single-spin Dirac states reported herein for the NiCl3\nmonolayer lead us to propose that this material give a great promise for\npotential realization of a near-room temperature QAH effect and potential\napplications in spintronics. Last but not least the calculated Fermi velocities\nof Dirac fermion of about 4x105 m/s indicate very high mobility in NiCl3\nmonolayers.\n", "  We investigate the vertical gradient of the magnetic field of sunspots in the\nphotospheric layer. Independent observations were obtained with the SOT/SP\nonboard the Hinode spacecraft and with the TIP-2 mounted at the VTT. We apply\nstate-of-the-art inversion techniques to both data sets to retrieve the\nmagnetic field and the corresponding vertical gradient. In the sunspot\npenumbrae we detected patches of negative vertical gradients of the magnetic\nfield strength, i.e.,the magnetic field strength decreases with optical depth\nin the photosphere. The negative gradient patches are located in the inner and\npartly in the middle penumbrae in both data sets. From the SOT/SP observations,\nwe found that the negative gradient patches are restricted mainly to the deep\nphotospheric layers and are concentrated near the edges of the penumbral\nfilaments. MHD simulations also show negative gradients in the inner penumbrae,\nalso at the locations of filaments. Both in the observations and simulation\nnegative gradients of the magnetic field vs. optical depth dominate at some\nradial distances in the penumbra. The negative gradient with respect to optical\ndepth in the inner penumbrae persists even after averaging in the azimuthal\ndirection, both in the observations and, to a lesser extent, also in MHD\nsimulations. We interpret the observed localized presence of the negative\nvertical gradient of the magnetic field strength in the observations as a\nconsequence of stronger field from spines expanding with height and closing\nabove the weaker field inter-spines. The presence of the negative gradients\nwith respect to optical depth after azimuthal averaging can be explained by two\ndifferent mechanisms: the high corrugation of equal optical depth surfaces and\nthe cancellation of polarized signal due to the presence of unresolved opposite\npolarity patches in the deeper layers of the penumbra.\n", "  Double parton scattering (DPS) is studied at the example of $J/\\psi$\npair-production in the LHCb and ATLAS experiments of the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{S}=$ 7, 8, and 13 TeV. We report\ntheoretical predictions delivered to the LHCb and ATLAS collaborations adjusted\nfor the fiducial volumes of the corresponding measurements during Run I and\nprovide new predictions at 13 TeV collision energy. It is shown that DPS can\nlead to noticeable contributions in the distributions of longitudinal variables\nof the di-$J/\\psi$ system, especially at 13 TeV. The increased DPS rate in\ndouble $J/\\psi$ production at high energies will open up more possibilities for\nthe separation of single parton scattering (SPS) and DPS contributions in\nfuture studies.\n", "  We explore a new horizon of modified gravity from the viewpoint of the\nparticle physics. As a concrete example, we take the $F(R)$ gravity to raise a\nquestion: can a scalar particle (\"scalaron\") derived from the $F(R)$ gravity be\na dark matter candidate? We place the limit on the parameter in a class of\n$F(R)$ gravity model from the constraint on the scalaron as a dark matter. The\nrole of the screening mechanism and compatibility with the dark energy problem\nare addressed.\n", "  We present a systematic, perturbative method for correcting quantum gates to\nsuppress errors that take the target system out of a chosen subspace. It\naddresses the generic problem of non-adiabatic errors in adiabatic evolution\nand state preparation, as well as general leakage errors due to spurious\ncouplings to undesirable states. The method is based on the Magnus expansion:\nby correcting control pulses, we modify the Magnus expansion of an\ninitially-given, imperfect unitary in such a way that the desired evolution is\nobtained. Applications to adiabatic quantum state transfer, superconducting\nqubits and generalized Landau-Zener problems are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the perturbative expansion in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory\ncompactified on $\\mathbb{R}^2\\times \\mathbb{T}^2$ where the compact space is a\ntorus $\\mathbb{T}^2= S^1_{\\beta}\\times S^1_{L}$, with $S^1_{\\beta}$ being a\nthermal circle with period $\\beta=1/T$ ($T$ is the temperature) while $S^1_L$\nis a circle with finite length $L=1/M$, where $M$ is an energy scale. A\nLinde-type analysis indicates that perturbative calculations for the pressure\nin this theory break down already at order $\\mathcal{O}(g^2)$ due to the\npresence of a non-perturbative scale $\\sim g \\sqrt{TM}$. We conjecture that a\nsimilar result should hold if the torus is replaced by any other compact\nsurface of genus one.\n", "  The formation of silicate dust in oxygen-rich envelopes of evolved stars is\nthought to be initiated by formation of seed particles that can withstand the\nhigh temperatures close to the stellar photosphere and act as condensation\ncores farther away from the star. Candidate species considered as first\ncondensates are TiO and TiO$_2$. We aim to identify and characterize the\ncircumstellar gas-phase chemistry of titanium that leads to the formation of\nsolid titanium compounds in the envelope of $o$ Cet, the prototypical Mira, and\nseek an observational verification of whether titanium oxides play a major role\nin the onset of dust formation in M-type AGB stars. We present high\nangular-resolution ALMA observations at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths\nsupplemented by APEX and Herschel spectra of the rotational features of TiO and\nTiO$_2$. In addition, circumstellar features of TiO and TiI are identified in\noptical spectra which cover multiple pulsation cycles of $o$ Cet. The submm\nALMA data reveal TiO and TiO$_2$ bearing gas within the extended atmosphere of\nMira. While TiO is traceable up to a radius (FWHM/2) of 4.0 R$_{\\star}$,\nTiO$_2$ extends as far as 5.5 R$_{\\star}$ and unlike TiO appears to be\nanisotropically distributed. Optical spectra display variable emission of TiI\nand TiO from inner parts of the extended atmosphere (<3 R$_{\\star}$). Chemical\nmodels which include shocks are in general agreement with the observations of\ngas-phase titanium-bearing molecules. It is unlikely that substantial amounts\nof titanium is locked up in solids because the abundance of the gaseous\ntitanium species is very high. In particular, formation of hot titanium-rich\ncondensates is very improbable because we find no traces of their hot precursor\nspecies in the gas phase. It therefore appears unlikely that the formation of\ndust in Mira, and possibly other M-type AGB stars, is initiated by titanium\noxides.\n", "  SU(2) flat connection on 2D Riemann surface is shown to relate to the\ngeneralized twisted geometry in 3D space with cosmological constant. Various\nflat connection quantities on Riemann surface are mapped to the geometrical\nquantities in discrete 3D space. We propose that the moduli space of SU(2) flat\nconnections on Riemann surface generalizes the phase space of twisted geometry\nor Loop Quantum Gravity to include the cosmological constant.\n", "  We study the scaling properties of a one-dimensional interface at\nequilibrium, at finite temperature and in a disordered environment with a\nfinite disorder correlation length. We focus our approach on the scalings of\nits geometrical fluctuations as a function of its length. At large\nlengthscales, the roughness of the interface, defined as the variance of its\nendpoint fluctuations, follows a power-law behaviour whose exponent\ncharacterises its superdiffusive behaviour. In 1+1 dimensions, the roughness\nexponent is known to be the characteristic 2/3 exponent of the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. An important feature of the model\ndescription is that its Flory exponent, obtained by a power counting argument\non its Hamiltonian, is equal to 3/5 and thus does not yield the correct KPZ\nroughness exponent. In this work, we review the available power-counting\noptions, and relate the physical validity of the exponent values that they\npredict, to the existence (or not) of well-defined optimal trajectories in a\nlarge-size or low-temperature asymptotics. We identify the crucial role of the\n'cut-off' lengths of the problem (the disorder correlation length and the\nsystem size), which one has to carefully follow throughout the scaling\nanalysis. To complement the latter, we device a novel Gaussian Variational\nMethod (GVM) scheme to compute the roughness, taking into account the effect of\na large but finite interface length. Interestingly, such a procedure yields the\ncorrect KPZ roughness exponent, instead of the Flory exponent usually obtained\nthrough the GVM approach for an infinite interface. We explain the physical\norigin of this improvement of the GVM procedure and discuss possible extensions\nof this work to other disordered systems.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological implications of nonlocal modifications of general\nrelativity containing tensorial structures. Assuming the presence of standard\nradiation- and matter-dominated eras, we show that, except in very particular\ncases, the nonlocal terms contribute a rapidly growing energy density. These\nmodels therefore generically do not have a stable cosmological evolution.\n", "  We calculate the finite temperature linear DC conductance of a generic\nsingle-impurity Anderson model containing an arbitrary number of Fermi liquid\nleads, and apply the formalism to closed and open long Aharonov-Bohm-Kondo\n(ABK) rings. We show that, as with the short ABK ring, there is a contribution\nto the conductance from the connected 4-point Green's function of the\nconduction electrons. At sufficiently low temperatures this contribution can be\neliminated, and the conductance can be expressed as a linear function of the\nT-matrix of the screening channel. For closed rings we show that at\ntemperatures high compared to the Kondo temperature, the conductance behaves\ndifferently for temperatures above and below $v_F/L$ where $v_F$ is the Fermi\nvelocity and $L$ is the circumference of the ring. For open rings, when the\nring arms have both a small transmission and a small reflection, we show from\nthe microscopic model that the ring behaves like a two-path interferometer, and\nthat the Kondo temperature is unaffected by details of the ring. Our findings\nconfirm that ABK rings are potentially useful in the detection of the size of\nthe Kondo screening cloud, the $\\pi/2$ scattering phase shift from the Kondo\nsinglet, and the suppression of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations due to inelastic\nscattering.\n", "  We study the colors and orientations of structures in low and intermediate\ninclination barred galaxies. We test the hypothesis that barlenses, roundish\ncentral components embedded in bars, could form a part of the bar in a similar\nmanner to boxy/peanut bulges in the edge-on view. A sample of 79 barlens\ngalaxies was selected from the S$^4$G and the NIRS0S surveys. The sizes,\nellipticities, and orientations of barlenses were measured and used to define\nthe barlens regions in the color measurements. The orientations of barlenses\nwere studied with respect to those of the \"thin bars\" and the line-of-nodes of\nthe disks. For 47 galaxies color maps were constructed using the SDSS images in\nfive optical bands, u, g, r, i, and z. Colors of bars, barlenses, disks, and\ncentral regions of the galaxies were measured using two different approaches\nand color-color diagrams sensitive to metallicity, stellar surface gravity, and\nshort lived stars were constructed. Color differences between the structure\ncomponents were calculated for each individual galaxy, and presented in\nhistogram form. We find that the colors of barlenses are very similar to those\nof the surrounding bars, indicating that most probably they form part of the\nbar. We also find that barlenses have orientations closer to the disk\nline-of-nodes than to the thin bars, which is consistent with the idea that\nthey are vertically thick, in a similar manner as the boxy/peanut structures in\nmore inclined galaxies. Typically, the colors of barlenses are similar to those\nof normal E/S0 galaxies. Galaxy by galaxy studies show that in spiral galaxies\nvery dusty barlenses also exist, along with barlenses with rejuvenated stellar\npopulations. The central regions of galaxies are found to be on average redder\nthan bars or barlenses, although galaxies with bluer central peaks also exist.\n", "  We consider, for the first time, correlations between produced quarks in p-A\ncollisions in the framework of the Color Glass Condensate. We find a\nquark-quark ridge that shows a dip at $\\Delta\\eta\\sim 2$ relative to the\ngluon-gluon ridge. The origin of this dip is the short range (in rapidity)\nPauli blocking experienced by quarks in the wave function of the incoming\nprojectile. We observe that these correlations, present in the initial state,\nsurvive the scattering process. We suggest that this effect may be observable\nin open charm-open charm correlations at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  The spin-orbit interaction of holes in zinc-blende semiconductors is much\nstronger than that of electrons. This makes the hole systems very attractive\nfor possible spintronics applications. In three dimensions (3D) dynamics of\nholes is described by well known Luttinger Hamiltonian. However, most of recent\nspintronics applications are related to two dimensional heterostructures where\ndynamics in one direction is frozen due to quantum confinement. The confinement\nresults in dimensional reduction of the Luttinger Hamiltonian, 3D ->2D. Due to\ninterplay of the spin-orbit interaction, the external magnetic field, and the\nlateral gate potential imposed on the heterostructure the reduction is highly\nnontrivial and not known. In the present work we perform the reduction and\nhence derive the general effective Hamiltonian which describes spintronics\neffects in symmetric two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures. In particular, we\ndo the following, (i) derive the spin-orbit interaction and the Darwin\ninteraction related to the lateral gate potential, (ii) determine the momentum\ndependent out-of-plane g-factor, (iii) point out that there are two independent\nin-plane g-factors, (iv) determine momentum dependencies of the in-plane\ng-factors.\n", "  We report on the implementation of quantum frequency conversion (QFC) between\ninfrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths by using single-stage\nupconversion in a periodically poled KTP waveguide. Due to the monolithic\nwaveguide design, we manage to transfer a telecommunication band input photon\nto the wavelength of the ionic dipole transition of Yb${}^{+}$ at 369.5 nm. The\nexternal (internal) conversion efficiency is around 5\\% (10\\%). The high energy\npump used in this converter introduces a spontaneous parametric downconversion\n(SPDC) process, which is a cause for noise in the UV mode. Using this SPDC\nprocess, we show that the converter preserves non-classical correlations in the\nupconversion process, rendering this miniaturized interface a source for\nquantum states of light in the UV.\n", "  We present an analytic formula for the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space on\nthe basis of the halo approach description with the halo occupation\ndistribution of central galaxies and satellite galaxies. This work is an\nextension of a previous work on the galaxy power spectrum, which illuminated\nthe significant contribution of satellite galaxies to the higher multipole\nspectrum through the non-linear redshift space distortions of their random\nmotions. Behaviors of the multipoles of the bispectrum are compared with\nresults of numerical simulations assuming a halo occupation distribution of the\nLOWZ sample of the SDSS-III BOSS survey. Also presented are analytic\napproximate formulas for the multipoles of the bispectrum, which is useful to\nunderstanding their characteristic properties. We demonstrate that the Fingers\nof God effect is quite important for the higher multipoles of the bispectrum in\nredshift space, depending on the halo occupation distribution parameters.\n", "  The magnetic moments of the recently observed resonance $X_b(5568)$ by DO\nCollaboration and its partner with charm quark are calculated in the framework\nof the light cone QCD sum rules, by assuming that these resonances are\nrepresented as tetra--quark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{+\\pm}$. The\nmagnetic moment can play critical role in determination of the quantum numbers,\nas well as giving useful information about the inner structure of these mesons.\n", "  We show that several qubits can be integrated in a single magnetic ion, using\nits internal electronic spin states with energies tuned by a suitably chosen\nmolecular environment. This approach is illustrated with a nearly-isotropic\nGd(III) ion entrapped in a polyoxometalate molecule. Experiments with microwave\ntechnologies, either three dimensional cavities or quantum superconducting\ncircuits, show that this magnetic molecule possesses the number of spin states\nand the set of coherently addressable transitions connecting these states that\nare needed to perform a universal three-qubit processor or, equivalently, a\nd=8-level 'qudit'. Our findings open prospects for developing more\nsophisticated magnetic molecules which can result in more powerful and noise\nresilient quantum computation schemes.\n", "  We present a dielectric study on the dynamics of supercooled glycerol during\ncrystallization. We explore the transformation into a solid phase in real time\nby monitoring the temporal evolution of the amplitude of the dielectric signal.\nNeither the initial nucleation or the crystal growth influence the liquid\ndynamics visibly. For one of the samples studied, a tiny fraction of glycerol\nremained in the disordered state after the end of the transition. We examined\nthe nature of the alpha relaxation in this frustrated crystal and find that it\nis virtually identical to the bulk dynamics. In addition to that, we have found\nno evidence that supercooled glycerol transforms into a peculiar phase where\neither a new solid amorphous state or nano-crystals dispersed in a liquid\nmatrix are formed.\n", "  Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) is an alternative framework for dark-matter\nphysics in which the dark sector comprises a vast ensemble of particle species\nwhose decay widths are balanced against their cosmological abundances. Previous\nstudies of this framework have focused on a particular class of DDM ensembles\n--- motivated primarily by KK towers in theories with extra dimensions --- in\nwhich the density of states scales roughly as a polynomial of mass. In this\npaper, by contrast, we study the properties of a different class of DDM\nensembles in which the density of states grows exponentially with mass.\nEnsembles with this Hagedorn-like property arise naturally as the \"hadrons\"\nassociated with the confining phase of a strongly-coupled dark sector; they\nalso arise naturally as the gauge-neutral bulk states of Type I string\ntheories. We study the dynamical properties of such ensembles, and demonstrate\nthat an appropriate DDM-like balancing between decay widths and abundances can\nemerge naturally --- even with an exponentially rising density of states. We\nalso study the effective equations of state for such ensembles, and investigate\nsome of the model-independent observational constraints on such ensembles that\nfollow directly from these equations of state. In general, we find that such\nconstraints tend to introduce correlations between various properties of these\nDDM ensembles such as their associated mass scales, lifetimes, and abundance\ndistributions. For example, we find that these constraints allow DDM ensembles\nwith energy scales ranging from the GeV scale all the way to the Planck scale,\nbut the total present-day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be\nspread across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these\nenergy scales are dialed from the Planck scale down to the GeV scale. Numerous\nother correlations and constraints are also discussed.\n", "  We revisit the question of whether the observed periodicity of comet impacts\non Earth is consistent with Solar oscillation about the Galactic midplane and\nspiral arm crossings, here in the context of dissipative dark matter models.\nConsider whether a hypothetical thin dark disk, a signature of these models, is\nnecessary to give the right periodicity, and whether such a dark disk is\nallowed given kinematic and other observational constraints on the Galaxy's\ngravitational potential, taking into account recent updates of these limits\nbased on the vertical epicyclic oscillations of the tracer populations. Our\nanalysis contains updated parameters for the Galactic disk, a self-consistent\ngravitational potential under the Poisson-Jeans equations, and includes prior\nprobabilities from local stellar kinematics and the distribution of Milky Way\ninterstellar gas. Moreover, our analysis also includes radial oscillations and\nGalactic spiral arm crossings. We find a dark disk explanation for the comet\nperiodicity to be 10 times more likely than a constant average rate model.\nMoreover, we find that spiral arm crossing is necessary to correctly predict\nthe date of the Chicxulub crater dated to 66 My ago.\n", "  Ghost imaging with thermal fermions is calculated based on two-particle\ninterference in Feynman's path integral theory. It is found that ghost imaging\nwith thermal fermions can be simulated by ghost imaging with thermal bosons and\nclassical particles. Photons in pseudothermal light are employed to\nexperimentally study fermionic ghost imaging. Ghost imaging with thermal bosons\nand fermions is discussed based on the point-to-point (spot) correlation\nbetween the object and image planes. The employed method offers an efficient\nguidance for future ghost imaging with real thermal fermions, which may also be\ngeneralized to study other second-order interference phenomena with fermions.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of homogeneous decaying turbulence with mild\nbackground rotation show the existence of a systematic and significant\nimbalance between the non-linear energy cascade to small scales and its\ndissipation. By starting the decay from a statistically stationary and fully\ndeveloped rotating turbulence state, where the dissipation and the energy flux\nare approximately equal, the data shows a growing imbalance between the two\nuntil a maximum is reached when the dissipation is about twice the energy flux.\nThis dichotomy of behaviours during decay is reminiscent of the non-equilibrium\nand the equilibrium regions previously reported for non-rotating turbulence\n[P.C. Valente, J.C. Vassilicos, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 108} 214503 (2012)].\nNote, however, that for decaying rotating turbulence the classical scaling of\nthe dissipation rate $\\epsilon \\propto u'^3/L$ (where $u'$ and $L$ are the root\nmean square fluctuating velocity and the integral length scale, respectively)\ndoes not appear to hold during decay, which may be attributed to the effect of\nthe background rotation on the energy cascade. On the other hand, the maximum\nenergy flux holds the scaling $\\Pi_{max} \\propto u'^3/L$ in the initial stage\nof the decay until the maximum imbalance is reached.\n", "  Quasi-elastic electron scattering on the deuteron is a benchmark reaction to\ntest our understanding of deuteron structure and the properties and\ninteractions of the two nucleons bound in the deuteron. The experimental data\npresented here can be used to test state-of-the-art models of the deuteron and\nthe two-nucleon interaction in the final state after two-body breakup of the\ndeuteron. Focusing on polarization degrees of freedom, we gain information on\nspin-momentum correlations in the deuteron ground state (due to the D-state\nadmixture) and on the limits of the Impulse Approximation (IA) picture as it\napplies to measurements of spin-dependent observables like spin structure\nfunctions for bound nucleons. We measured the beam-target double spin asymmetry\nfor quasi-elastic electron scattering off the deuteron at several beam energies\nusing the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at the Thomas Jefferson\nNational Accelerator Facility. The deuterons were polarized along (or opposite\nto) the beam direction. The double spin asymmetries were measured as a function\nof photon virtuality , missing momentum, and the angle between the (inferred)\n\"spectator\" neutron and the momentum transfer direction. The results are\ncompared with a recent model that includes Final State Interactions (FSI) using\na complete parameterization of nucleon-nucleon scattering, as well as a\nsimplified model using the Plane Wave Impulse Approximation (PWIA). We find\noverall good agreement with both the PWIA and FSI expectations at low to medium\nmissing momenta, including the change of the asymmetry due to the contribution\nof the deuteron D-state at higher momenta. At the highest missing momenta, our\ndata clearly agree better with the calculations including FSI.\n", "  The discovery of gravitational waves (GW) by Advanced LIGO has ushered us\ninto an era of observational GW astrophysics. Compact binaries remain the\nprimary target sources for LIGO, of which neutron star-black hole (NSBH)\nbinaries form an important subset. GWs from NSBH sources carry signatures of\n(a) the tidal distortion of the neutron star by its companion black hole during\ninspiral, and (b) its potential tidal disruption near merger. In this paper, we\npresent a Bayesian study of the measurability of neutron star tidal\ndeformability $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{NS}\\propto (R/M)^{5}$ using observation(s) of\ninspiral-merger GW signals from disruptive NSBH coalescences, taking into\naccount the crucial effect of black hole spins. First, we find that if\nnon-tidal templates are used to estimate source parameters for an NSBH signal,\nthe bias introduced in the estimation of non-tidal physical parameters will\nonly be significant for loud signals with signal-to-noise ratios $> 30$. For\nsimilarly loud signals, we also find that we can begin to put interesting\nconstraints on $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{NS}$ (factor of 1-2) with individual\nobservations. Next, we study how a population of realistic NSBH detections will\nimprove our measurement of neutron star tidal deformability. For astrophysical\npopulations of $disruptive$ NSBH mergers, we find 20-35 events to be sufficient\nto constrain $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{NS}$ within $\\pm 25-50\\%$, depending on the\nchosen equation of state. In this we also assume that LIGO will detect black\nholes with masses within the astrophysical $mass$-$gap$. If the mass-gap\nremains preserved in NSBHs detected by LIGO, we estimate that $25\\%$\n$additional$ detections will furnish comparable tidal measurement accuracy. In\nboth cases, we find that the loudest 5-10 events to provide most of the tidal\ninformation, thereby facilitating targeted follow-ups of NSBHs in the upcoming\nLIGO-Virgo runs.\n", "  In this paper we consider a class of probability distributions on the\nsix-vertex model from statistical mechanics, which originate from the higher\nspin vertex models of https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05770. We define operators,\ninspired by the Macdonald difference operators, which extract various\ncorrelation functions, measuring the probability of observing different arrow\nconfigurations. The development of our operators is largely based on the\nproperties of a remarkable family of symmetric rational functions, which were\npreviously studied in https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0976.\n  For the class of models we consider, the correlation functions can be\nexpressed in terms of multiple contour integrals, which are suitable for\nasymptotic analysis. For a particular choice of parameters we analyze the limit\nof the correlation functions through a steepest descent method. Combining this\nasymptotic statement with some new results about Gibbs measures on\nGelfand-Tsetlin cones and patterns, we show that the asymptotic behavior of our\nsix-vertex model near the boundary is described by the GUE-corners process.\n", "  We investigate the delivery of regular and deuterated forms of water from\nprestellar cores to circumstellar disks. We adopt a semi-analytical\naxisymmetric two-dimensional collapsing core model with post-processing gas-ice\nastrochemical simulations, in which a layered ice structure is considered. The\nphysical and chemical evolutions are followed until the end of the main\naccretion phase. When mass averaged over the whole disk, a forming disk has a\nsimilar H2O abundance and HDO/H2O abundance ratio as their precollapse values\n(within a factor of 2), regardless of time in our models. Consistent with\nprevious studies, our models suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered\nto forming disks without significant alteration. On the other hand, the local\nvertically averaged H2O ice abundance and HDO/H2O ice ratio can differ more, by\nup to a factor of several, depending on time and distance from a central star.\nKey parameters for the local variations are the fluence of stellar UV photons\nen route into the disk and the ice layered structure, the latter of which is\nmostly established in the prestellar stages. We also find that even if\ninterstellar water ice is destroyed by stellar UV and (partly) reformed prior\nto disk entry, the HDO/H2O ratio in reformed water ice is similar to the\noriginal value. This finding indicates that some caution is needed in\ndiscussions on the prestellar inheritance of H2O based on comparisons between\nthe observationally derived HDO/H2O ratio in clouds/cores and that in\ndisks/comets. Alternatively, we propose that the ratio of D2O/HDO to HDO/H2O\nbetter probes the prestellar inheritance of H2O. It is also found that icy\norganics are more enriched in deuterium than water ice in forming disks. The\ndifferential deuterium fractionation in water and organics is inherited from\nthe prestellar stages.\n", "  A search for the $B^{0}\\to K^{+}K^{-}$ decay is performed using\n$pp$-collision data collected by LHCb. The data set corresponds to integrated\nluminosities of 1 and 2 fb$^{-1}$ at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV,\nrespectively. This decay is observed for the first time, with a significance of\nmore than five standard deviations. The analysis also results in an improved\nmeasurement of the branching fraction for the $B_s^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay. The\nmeasured branching fractions are $BR(B^0\\to K^+K^-) = (7.80 \\pm 1.27 \\pm 0.81\n\\pm 0.21) \\times 10^{-8}$ and $BR(B_s^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-) = (6.91 \\pm 0.54 \\pm 0.63\n\\pm 0.19 \\pm 0.40) \\times 10^{-7}$. The first uncertainty is statistical, the\nsecond is systematic, the third is due to the uncertainty on the $B^0\\to\nK^+\\pi^-$ branching fraction used as a normalization. For the $B_s^0$ mode, the\nfourth accounts for the uncertainty on the ratio of the probabilities for $b$\nquarks to hadronize into $B_s^0$ and $B^0$ mesons.\n", "  Using muon spin rotation and infrared spectroscopy we study the relation\nbetween magnetism and superconductivity in Ba$ _{1-x} $K$ _{x} $Fe$ _{2} $As$\n_{2} $ single crystals from the underdoped to the slightly overdoped regime. We\nfind that the Fe magnetic moment is only moderately suppressed in most of the\nunderdoped region where it decreases more slowly than the N\\'{e}el-temperature,\n$ T^{\\mathrm{N}} $. This applies for both the total Fe moment obtained from\nmuon spin rotation and for the itinerant component that is deduced from the\nspectral weight of the spin-density-wave pair breaking peak in the infrared\nresponse. In the moderately underdoped region, superconducting and static\nmagnetic orders co-exist on the nano-scale and compete for the same electronic\nstates. The static magnetic moment disappears rather sharply near optimal\ndoping, however, in the slightly overdoped region there is still an enhancement\nor slowing down of spin fluctuations in the superconducting state. Similar to\nthe gap magnitude reported from specific heat measurements, the superconducting\ncondensate density is nearly constant in the optimally- and slightly overdoped\nregion, but exhibits a rather pronounced decrease on the underdoped side.\nSeveral of these observations are similar to the phenomenology in the electron\ndoped counterpart Ba(Fe$ _{1-y} $Co$ _{y} $)$ _{2} $As$ _{2} $.\n", "  In this work we present first results on vector and axial-vector meson\nspectral functions as obtained by applying the non-perturbative functional\nrenormalization group approach to an effective low-energy theory motivated by\nthe gauged linear sigma model. By using a recently proposed analytic\ncontinuation method, we study the in-medium behavior of the spectral functions\nof the $\\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons in different regimes of the phase diagram. In\nparticular, we demonstrate explicitly how these spectral functions degenerate\nat high temperatures as well as at large chemical potentials, as a consequence\nof the restoration of chiral symmetry. In addition, we also compute the\nmomentum dependence of the $\\rho$ and $a_1$ spectral functions and discuss the\nvarious time-like and space-like processes that can occur.\n", "  We propose measurements of weighted differences of the angular observables in\nthe rare decays $B \\to K^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$. The proposed observables are very\nsensitive to the difference between the Wilson coefficients\n$\\mathcal{C}_9^{(e)}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_9^{(\\mu)}$ for decays into electrons and\nmuons, respectively. At the same time, the charm-induced hadronic contributions\nare kinematically suppressed to $\\lesssim 7\\% (4\\%)$ in the region $1\\,$GeV$^2\n\\leq q^2 \\leq 6\\,$GeV$^2$, as long as LFU breaking occurs only in\n$\\mathcal{C}^{(\\ell)}_{9}$. This suppression becomes stronger for the region of\nlow hadronic recoil, $q^2 \\geq 15\\,$GeV$^2$.\n", "  One-dimensional organo-metal halide Perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) nanorods whose\ndiameter and length are dictated by the inner size of porous silicon nanotube\ntemplates have been grown, characterized and compared to bulk perovskites in\nthe form of microwires. We have observed a structural phase transition for bulk\nperovskites, where the crystal structure changes from tetragonal to\northorhombic at about 150K, as opposed to small diameter one-dimensional\nperovskite nanorods, of the order of 30-70 nm in diameter, where the phase\ntransition is inhibited and the dominant phase remains tetragonal. Two major\nexperimental techniques, infrared absorption spectroscopy and\nphotoluminescence, were utilized to probe the temperature dependence of the\nperovskite phases over the 4-300K temperature range. Yet, different\ncharacteristics of the phase transition were measured by the two spectroscopic\nmethods and explained by the presence of small, tetragonal inclusions embedded\nin the orthorhombic phase. The inhibition of the phase transition is attributed\nto the large surface area of these one-dimensional perovskite nanorods, which\ngives rise to a large stress that, in turn, prevents the formation of the\northorhombic phase. The absence of phase transition enables the measurement of\nthe tetragonal bandgap energy down to low temperatures.\n", "  We develop a method to calculate left-right eigenvector correlations of the\nproduct of $m$ independent $N\\times N$ complex Ginibre matrices. For\nillustration, we present explicit analytical results for the vector overlap for\na couple of examples for small $m$ and $N$. We conjecture that the integrated\noverlap between left and right eigenvectors is given by the formula $O = 1 +\n(m/2)(N-1)$ and support this conjecture by analytical and numerical\ncalculations. We derive an analytical expression for the limiting correlation\ndensity as $N\\rightarrow \\infty$ for the product of Ginibre matrices as well as\nfor the product of elliptic matrices. In the latter case, we find that the\ncorrelation function is independent of the eccentricities of the elliptic laws.\n", "  Using the $R$-matrix approach we calculate the radiative width for a\nresonance decaying to a bound state through electric dipole, $E1$, transitions.\nThe total radiative width is determined by the interference of the nuclear\ninternal and external radiative width amplitudes. For a given channel radius\nthe external radiative width amplitude is model independent and is determined\nby the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the bound state to which\nthe resonance decays. It also depends on the partial resonance width. To\ncalculate the internal radiative width amplitude we show that a single particle\npotential model is appropriate. We compare our results with a few experimental\ndata.\n", "  Low frequency high precision laser interferometry is subject to excess\nlaser-frequency-noise coupling via arm-length differences which is commonly\nmitigated by locking the frequency to a stable reference system. This approach\nis crucial to achieve picometer level sensitivities in the 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz\nregime, where laser frequency noise is usually high and couples into the\nmeasurement phase via arm-length mismatches in the interferometers. Here we\ndescribe the results achieved by frequency stabilising an external cavity diode\nlaser to a quasi-monolithic unequal arm-length Mach-Zehnder interferometer read\nout at mid-fringe via balanced detection. We find this stabilization scheme to\nbe an elegant solution combining a minimal number of optical components, no\nadditional laser modulations and relatively low frequency noise levels. The\nMach-Zehnder interferometer has been designed and constructed to minimize the\ninfluence of thermal couplings and to reduce undesired stray light using the\noptical simulation tool ifocad. We achieve frequency-noise levels below 100\nHz/$\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz and are able to demonstrate the LISA frequency\nprestabilization requirement of 300 Hz/$\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ down to frequencies\nof 100 mHz by beating the stabilized laser with an iodine-locked reference.\n", "  The S-stars discovered in the Galactic center (GC) are expected to provide\nunique dynamical tests of the Kerr metric of the massive black hole (MBH)\norbited by them. In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the\nrelated relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the\ngravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is\nquite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a\ntypical target star, i.e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to\nboth the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a\nsingle or a cluster of disturbing object(s). We find that, in most cases, the\nNewtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the\nperturbed orbital period of the target star, rather than the Newtonian orbital\nprecessions. The Newtonian perturbations have their unique features when they\npeak around the pericenter passage in each revolution, which is quite different\nfrom those of the spin-induced effects. Looking at the currently detected star\nS2/S0-2, we find that its spin-induced effects on both the image position and\nredshift are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the\nstar S0-102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations\non a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of the currently detected\nones. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the\ncentral MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and\nthe redshift dominate over the stellar perturbations for target stars with\norbital semimajor axis smaller than $100-400$AU if the MBH is maximally\nspinning. Our results suggest that, in principle, the stellar perturbations can\nbe removed as they have distinctive morphologies comparing to those of the\nrelativistic Kerr-type signatures.\n", "  We propose and analyse a pumped Bose-Hubbard dimer as a source of\ncontinuous-variable Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering with non-Gaussian\nstatistics. We use the truncated Wigner representation to calculate third and\nfourth order cumulants, finding clear signals of non-Gaussianity. We also\ncalculate the products of inferred quadrature variances which indicate that\nstates demonstrating the EPR paradox are present. Our proposed experimental\nconfiguration is extrapolated from current experimental techniques and adds\nanother possibility to the current toolbox of quantum atom optics.\n", "  We present a mid-IR interferometric survey of the circumstellar environment\nof a specific class of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) binaries. For\nthis class the presence of a compact dusty disk has been postulated on the\nbasis of various spatially unresolved measurements. Our interferometric survey\nwas performed with the MIDI instrument on the VLTI. In total 19 different\nsystems were observed using variable baseline configurations. Combining all the\nvisibilities at a single wavelength at 10.7 micron, we fitted two parametric\nmodels to the data: a uniform disk (UD) and a ring model mimicking a\ntemperature gradient. We compared our observables of the whole sample, with\nsynthetic data computed from a grid of radiative transfer models of passively\nirradiated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. These models are computed with a\nMonte Carlo code that has been widely applied to describe the structure of\nprotoplanetary disks around young stellar objects (YSO). The spatially resolved\nobservations show that the majority of our targets cluster closely together in\nthe distance-independent size-colour diagram, and have extremely compact N-band\nemission regions. The typical uniform disk diameter of the N-band emission\nregion is about 40 mass which corresponds to a typical brightness temperature\nof 400-600~K. The resolved objects display very similar characteristics in the\ninterferometric observables and in the spectral energy distributions.\nTherefore, the physical properties of the disks around our targets must be\nsimilar. The grid of protoplanetary disk models covers very well the observed\nobjects. Much like for young stars, the spatially resolved N-band emission\nregion is determined by the hot inner rim of the disk. Continued comparisons\nbetween post-AGB and protoplanetary disks will help to understand grain growth\nand disk evolution processes,\n", "  We consider a problem of persistent magnetization precession in a single\ndomain ferromagnetic nano particle under the driving by the spin-transfer\ntorque. We find that the adjustment of the electronic distribution function in\nthe particle renders this state unstable. Instead, abrupt switching of the spin\norientation is predicted upon increase of the spin-transfer torque current. On\nthe technical level, we derive an effective action of the type of\nAmbegaokar-Eckern-Sch\\\"on action for the coupled dynamics of magnetization\n(gauge group $SU(2)$) and voltage (gauge group $U(1)$).\n", "  We study the production of primordial magnetic fields in inflationary models\nin type IIB string theory where the role of the inflaton is played by a Kahler\nmodulus. We consider various possibilities to realise the Standard Model\ndegrees of freedom in this setting and explicitly determine the time dependence\nof the inflaton coupling to the Maxwell term in the models. Using this we\ndetermine the strength and scale dependence of the magnetic fields generated\nduring inflation. The usual \"strong coupling problem\" for primordial\nmagnetogesis manifests itself by cycle sizes approaching the string scale, this\nappears in a certain class of fibre inflation models where the standard model\nis realised by wrapping D7-branes on cycles in the geometric regime.\n", "  The benchmarks of the neoclassical transport codes based on the several local\ndrift-kinetic models are reported here. Here, the drift-kinetic models are ZOW,\nZMD, DKES-like, and global, as classified in [Matsuoka et al., Physics of\nPlasmas 22, 072511 (2015)]. The magnetic geometries of HSX, LHD, and W7-X are\nemployed in the benchmarks. It is found that the assumption of $\\boldsymbol E\n\\times \\boldsymbol B$ incompressibility causes discrepancy of neoclassical\nradial flux and parallel flow among the models, when $\\boldsymbol E \\times\n\\boldsymbol B$ is sufficiently large compared to the magnetic drift velocities.\nOn the other hand, when $\\boldsymbol E \\times \\boldsymbol B$ and the magnetic\ndrift velocities are comparable, the tangential magnetic drift, which is\nincluded in both the global and ZOW models, fills the role of suppressing\nunphysical peaking of neoclassical radial-fluxes found in the other local\nmodels at $E_r \\simeq 0$. In low collisionality plasmas, in particular, the\ntangential drift effect works well to suppress such unphysical behavior of the\nradial transport caused in the simulations. It is demonstrated that the ZOW\nmodel has the advantage of mitigating the unphysical behavior in the several\nmagnetic geometries, and that it also implements evaluation of bootstrap\ncurrent in LHD with the low computation cost compared to the global model.\n", "  Higher-dimensional multi-gluon interactions affect essentially all effective\nLagrangian analyses at the LHC. We show that, contrary to common lore, such\noperators are best constrained in multi-jet production. Our limit on the\ncorresponding new physics scale in the multi-TeV range exceeds the typical\nreach of global dimension-6 Higgs and top analyses. This implies that the pure\nYang-Mills operator can safely be neglected in almost all specific\nhigher-dimensional analyses at Run II.\n", "  We calculate the four-loop massless QCD corrections with three closed quark\nlines to quark and gluon form factors. We apply a novel integration by parts\nalgorithm based on modular arithmetic and compute all relevant master integrals\nfor arbitrary values of the space-time dimension. This is the first calculation\nof a gluon form factor at this perturbative order in QCD.\n", "  A non-Hermitian interferometer can realize asymmetric transmission in the\npresence of imaginary potential and magnetic flux. Here, we propose a\nnon-Hermitian dimer with an unequal hopping rate by an interferometer-like\ncluster in the framework of tight-binding model. The intriguing features of\nthis design are the wave-vector independence and unidirectionality of\nscattering, which amplifies wavepacket without distortion and absorbs\nincoherent wave without reflection. The absorption relates to the system\nspectral singularities, the dynamical behaviors of the spectral singularities\nare also investigated analytically and numerically.\n", "  We present a new approach for the quantification of quantumness of\ncorrelations in fermionic systems. We study the Multipartite Relative Entropy\nof Quantumness in such systems, and show how the symmetries in the states can\nbe used to obtain analytical solutions. Numerical evidences about the\nuniqueness of such solutions are also presented. Supported by these results, we\nshow that the minimization of the Multipartite Relative Entropy of Quantumness,\nover certain choices of its modes multipartitions, reduces to the notion of\nQuantumness of Indistinguishable Particles. By means of an activation protocol,\nwe characterize the class of states without quantumness of correlations. As an\nexample, we calculate the dynamics of quantumness of correlations for a purely\ndissipative system, whose stationary states exhibit interesting topological\nnon-local correlations.\n", "  Although uncertainty quantification has been making its way into nuclear\ntheory, these methods have yet to be explored in the context of reaction\ntheory. For example, it is well known that different parameterizations of the\noptical potential can result in different cross sections, but these differences\nhave not been systematically studied and quantified. The purpose of this work\nis to investigate the uncertainties in nuclear reactions that result from\nfitting a given model to elastic-scattering data, as well as to study how these\nuncertainties propagate to the inelastic and transfer channels. We use\nstatistical methods to determine a best fit and create corresponding 95\\%\nconfidence bands. A simple model of the process is fit to elastic-scattering\ndata and used to predict either inelastic or transfer cross sections. In this\ninitial work, we assume that our model is correct, and the only uncertainties\ncome from the variation of the fit parameters. We study a number of reactions\ninvolving neutron and deuteron projectiles with energies in the range of 5-25\nMeV/u, on targets with mass $A$=12-208. We investigate the correlations between\nthe parameters in the fit. The case of deuterons on $^{12}$C is discussed in\ndetail: the elastic-scattering fit and the prediction of $^{12}$C(d,p)$^{13}$C\ntransfer angular distributions, using both uncorrelated and correlated $\\chi^2$\nminimization functions. The general features for all cases are compiled in a\nsystematic manner to identify trends. Our work shows that, in many cases, the\ncorrelated $\\chi ^2$ functions (in comparison to the uncorrelated $\\chi^2$\nfunctions) provide a more natural parameterization of the process. These\ncorrelated functions do, however, produce broader confidence bands. Further\noptimization may require improvement in the models themselves and/or more\ninformation included in the fit.\n", "  Neutrino flavor conversion studies based on astrophysical environments\nusually implement neutrino mixings, neutrino interactions with matter and\nneutrino self-interactions. In anisotropic media, the most general mean-field\ntreatment includes neutrino mass contributions as well, that introduce a\ncoupling between neutrinos and antineutrinos termed helicity or spin coherence.\nWe discuss resonance conditions for helicity coherence for Dirac and Majorana\nneutrinos. We explore the role of these mean-field contributions on flavor\nevolution in the context of a binary neutron star merger remnant. We find that\nresonance conditions can be satisfied in neutron star merger scenarios while\nadiabaticity is not sufficient for efficient flavor conversion. We analyse our\nnumerical findings by discussing general conditions to have multiple MSW-like\nresonances, in presence of non-linear feedback, in astrophysical environments.\n", "  IRAS 18511+0146 is a young embedded (proto)cluster located at 3.5 kpc\nsurrounding what appears to be an intermediate mass protostar. In this paper,\nwe investigate the nature of cluster members (two of which are believed to be\nthe most massive and luminous) using imaging and spectroscopy in the near and\nmid-infrared. The brightest point-like object associated with IRAS 18511+0146\nis referred to as S7 in the present work (designated UGPS J185337.88+015030.5\nin the UKIRT Galactic Plane survey). Seven of the nine objects show rising\nspectral energy distributions (SED) in the near-infrared, with four objects\nshowing Br-gamma emission. Three members: S7, S10 (also UGPS\nJ185338.37+015015.3) and S11 (also UGPS J185338.72+015013.5) are bright in\nmid-infrared with diffuse emission being detected in the vicinity of S11 in PAH\nbands. Silicate absorption is detected towards these three objects, with an\nabsorption maximum between 9.6 and 9.7 um, large optical depths (1.8-3.2), and\nprofile widths of 1.6-2.1 um. The silicate profiles of S7 and S10 are similar,\nin contrast to S11 (which has the largest width and optical depth). The cold\ndust emission investigated using Herschel HiGal peaks at S7, with temperature\nat 26 K and column density N(H2) ~ 7 x 10^(22) cm^(-2). The bolometric\nluminosity of IRAS 18511 region is L ~ 1.8 x 10^4 L_sun. S7 is the main\ncontributor to the bolometric luminosity, with L (S7) > 10^4 L_sun. S7 is a\nhigh mass protostellar object with ionised stellar winds, evident from the\ncorrelation between radio and bolometric luminosity as well as the asymmetric\nBr-gamma profile. The differences in silicate profiles of S7 and S11 could be\ndue to different radiation environment as we believe the former to be more\nmassive and in an earlier phase than the latter.\n", "  Lamata et al. use an inductive approach to classify the entangled pure states\nof four qubits under stochastic local operations and classical communication\n(SLOCC) [PRA 75(2), 022318 (2007)]. The inductive method yields a priori ten\ndifferent entanglement superclasses, of which they discard three as empty. One\nof the remaining superclasses is split in two, resulting in eight superclasses\nof genuine four-qubit entanglement.\n  Here, we show that two of the three discarded superclasses are in fact\nnon-empty and should have been retained. We give explicit expressions for the\ncanonical states for those superclasses, up to SLOCC and qubit permutations.\nFurthermore, we confirm that the third discarded superclass is indeed empty,\nyielding a total of ten superclasses of genuine four-qubit entanglement under\nthe inductive classification scheme.\n", "  Graphene subject to high levels of shear strain leads to strong\npseudo-magnetic fields resulting in the emergence of Landau levels. Here we\nshow that, with modest levels of strain, graphene can also sustain a classical\nvalley hall effect (VHE) that can be detected in nonlocal transport\nmeasurements. We provide a theory of the strain-induced VHE starting from the\nquantum Boltzmann equation. This allows us to show that, averaging over\nshort-range impurity configurations destroys quantum coherence between valleys,\nleaving the elastic scattering time and inter-valley scattering rate as the\nonly parameters characterizing the transport theory. Using the theory, we\ncompute the nonlocal resistance of a Hall bar device in the diffusive regime.\nOur theory is also relevant for the study of moderate strain effects in the\n(nonlocal) transport properties of other two-dimensional materials and van der\nWalls heterostructures.\n", "  We consider a concise dark matter (DM) scenario in the context of a\nnon-exotic U(1) extension of the Standard Model (SM), where a new U(1)$_X$\ngauge symmetry is introduced along with three generation of right-handed\nneutrinos (RHNs) and an SM gauge singlet Higgs field. The model is a\ngeneralization of the minimal gauged U(1)$_{B-L}$ (baryon number minus lepton\nnumber) extension of the SM, in which the extra U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry is\nexpressed as a linear combination of the SM U(1)$_Y$ and U(1)$_{B-L}$ gauge\nsymmetries. We introduce a $Z_2$-parity and assign an odd-parity only for one\nRHN among all particles, so that this $Z_2$-odd RHN plays a role of DM. The\nso-called minimal seesaw mechanism is implemented in this model with only two\n$Z_2$-even RHNs. In this context, we investigate physics of the RHN DM,\nfocusing on the case that this DM particle communicates with the SM particles\nthrough the U(1)$_X$ gauge boson ($Z^\\prime$ boson). This \"$Z^\\prime$-portal\nRHN DM\" scenario is controlled by only three free parameters: the U(1)$_X$\ngauge coupling ($\\alpha_X$), the $Z^\\prime$ boson mass ($m_{Z^\\prime}$), and\nthe U(1)$_X$ charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$). We consider various\nphenomenological constraints to identify a phenomenologically viable parameter\nspace. The most important constraints are the observed DM relic abundance and\nthe latest LHC Run-2 results on the search for a narrow resonance with the\ndi-lepton final state. We find that these are complementary with each other and\nnarrow the allowed parameter region, leading to the lower mass bound of\n$m_{Z^\\prime} \\gtrsim 2.7$ TeV.\n", "  The precise measurement of molecular vibrational transition frequencies is\nuseful in the search for variation in the proton-to-electron mass ratio {\\mu}.\nHomonuclear diatomic molecules are particularly advantageous for precise\nmeasurement because of the small Stark shift. This paper discusses the Stark\nand Zeeman shifts in the 16O2+ vibrational transition frequencies.To search for\nthe variation {\\mu}(<10-17/yr), the X2{\\Pi}1/2(v,J)=(0,1/2)-(v',1/2)(v'>1)in\ntransition frequencies are much more advantageous than the transition\nfrequencies between the X2{\\Pi}1/2 v=21 and a4{\\Pi}1/2 v=0 states, whose\nsensitivity to the variation in {\\mu} is high because of the accidental\ndegeneracy.\n", "  The importance of the parallel momentum conservation on the bootstrap current\nevaluation in nonaxisymmetric systems is demonstrated by the benchmarks among\nthe local drift-kinetic equation solvers, i.e., the Zero-Orbit-width(ZOW),\nDKES, and PENTA codes. The ZOW model is extended to include the ion parallel\nmean flow effect on the electron-ion parallel friction. Compared to the DKES\nmodel in which only the pitch-angle-scattering term is included in the\ncollision operator, the PENTA model employs the Sugama-Nishimura method to\ncorrect the momentum balance. The ZOW and PENTA models agree each other well on\nthe calculations of the bootstrap current. The DKES results without the\nparallel momentum conservation deviates significantly from those from the ZOW\nand PENTA models. This work verifies the reliability of the bootstrap current\ncalculation with the ZOW and PENTA models for the helical plasmas.\n", "  Several different analysis methods have been developed to determine the\nstrong coupling via finite-energy sum-rule analyses of hadronic $\\tau$ decay\ndata. While most methods agree on the existence of the well-known ambiguity in\nthe choice of a resummation scheme due to the slow convergence of QCD\nperturbation theory at the $\\tau$ mass, there is an ongoing controversy over\nhow to deal properly with non-perturbative effects. These are small, but not\nnegligible, and include quark-hadron \"duality violations\" (i.e., resonance\neffects) which are not described by the operator product expansion (OPE). In\none approach, an attempt is made to suppress duality violations enough that\nthey might become negligible. The number of OPE parameters to be fit, however,\nthen exceeds the number of available sum rules, necessitating an uncontrolled\nOPE truncation, in which a number of higher-dimension OPE contributions in\ngeneral present in QCD are set to zero by hand. In the second approach,\ntruncation of the OPE is avoided by construction, and duality violations are\ntaken into account explicitly, using a physically motivated model. In this\narticle, we provide a critical appraisal of a recent analysis employing the\nfirst approach and demonstrate that it fails to properly account for\nnon-perturbative effects, making the resulting determination of the strong\ncoupling unreliable. The second approach, in contrast, passes all\nself-consistency tests, and provides a competitive determination of the strong\ncoupling from $\\tau$ decays.\n", "  Asteroid (130) Elektra belongs to one of the six known triple asteroids in\nthe main belt, so its mass has been reliably determined. We aim to use all\navailable disk-resolved images of (130) Elektra obtained by the SPHERE\ninstrument at VLT and by the Nirc2 of the Keck telescope together with the\ndisk-integrated photometry to determine its shape model and its size. The\nvolume can be then used in combination with the known mass to derive the bulk\ndensity of the primary. We apply the All-Data Asteroid Modeling (ADAM)\nalgorithm to the optical disk-integrated data, 2 disk-resolved images obtained\nby the SPHERE instrument and 13 disk-resolved images from the Nirc2 of the Keck\ntelescope, and derive the shape model and size of Elektra. We present the shape\nmodel, volume-equivalent diameter (199$\\pm$7 km) and bulk density\n(1.60$\\pm$0.13 g cm$^{-3}$) of the C-type asteroid Elektra.\n", "  We demonstrate that the recent measurement of the cross section line shapes\nof $e^+e^-\\to \\chi_{c0}\\omega$ can be naturally explained by the molecular\npicture for $Y(4260)$ where the $Y(4260)$ is treated as a hadronic molecule\ndominated by $\\bar{D}D_1(2420)+c.c.$ This result is consistent with properties\nextracted for $Y(4260)$ as the $\\bar{D}D_1(2420)+c.c.$ molecular state in other\nreactions such as $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$, $h_c\\pi\\pi$, $\\bar D D^*\\pi +c.c.$,\nand $\\gamma X(3872)$.\n", "  Rare event search experiments, such as those searching for dark matter and\nobservations of neutrinoless double beta decay, require ultra low levels of\nradioactive background for unmistakable identification. In order to reduce the\nradioactive backgrounds of detectors used in these types of event searches, low\nbackground photosensors are required, as the physical size of these detectors\nbecome increasing larger, and hence the number of such photosensors used also\nincreases rapidly. Considering that most dark matter and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay experiments are turning towards using noble liquids as the target\nchoice, liquid xenon and liquid argon for instance, photosensors that can work\nwell at cryogenic temperatures are required, 165 K and 87 K for liquid xenon\nand liquid argon, respectively. The Silicon Geiger Hybrid Tube (SiGHT) is a\nnovel photosensor designed specifically for use in ultra low background\nexperiments operating at cryogenic temperatures. It is based on the proven\nphotocathode plus silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) hybrid technology and consists\nof very few other, but also ultra radio-pure, materials like fused silica and\nsilicon for the SiPM. The introduction of the SiGHT concept, as well as a\nfeasibility study for its production, is reported in this paper.\n", "  We consider a spinless ultracold Fermi gas tightly trapped along the axis of\nan optical resonator and transversely illuminated by a laser closely tuned to a\nresonator mode. At a certain threshold pump intensity the homogeneous gas\ndensity breaks a $\\mathbf{Z}_2$ symmetry towards a spatially periodic order,\nwhich collectively scatters pump photons into the cavity. We show that this\nknown self-ordering transition also occurs for low field seeking fermionic\nparticles when the laser light is blue-detuned to an atomic transition. The\nemergent superradiant optical lattice in this case is homopolar and possesses\ntwo distinct dimerizations. Depending on the spontaneously chosen dimerization\nthe resulting Bloch bands can have a non-trivial topological structure\ncharacterized by a non-vanishing Zak phase. In the case the Fermi momentum is\nclose to half the cavity-mode wavenumber, a Peierls-like instability here\ncreates a topoloical insulator with a gap at the Fermi surface, which hosts a\npair of edge states. The topological features of the system can be\nnon-destructively observed via the cavity output: the Zak phase of the bulk\ncoincides with the relative phase between laser and cavity field, while the\nfingerprint of edge states can be observed as additional broadening in a well\ndefined frequency window of the cavity spectrum.\n", "  Proximity effects and pair currents were measured in epitaxial trilayer\n\\textit{c-axis} junctions comprise of a $PrBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}$ barrier\nsandwiched in between an overdoped $Y_{0.94}Ca_{0.06}Ba_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}$ and\nunderdoped $YBa_2Cu_{2.7}Co_{0.3}O_y$ layers. These junctions had two $\\rm T_c$\nvalues of $\\rm T_c(high)=84-86$ K and $\\rm T_c(low)=50-55$ K, allowing\ninvestigation when both electrodes are superconducting, or when only one is\nsuperconducting while the other is in its pseudogap regime. For T below $\\rm\nT_c(high)$ but much above $\\rm T_c(low)$, two distinct proximity effect\ntransitions were observed in the resistance at two temperature regimes, between\n80 and 84 K, and 76 to 80 K. The first is a conventional proximity effect with\nthe $\\rm T_c(high)$ electrode, while the second is a second-order proximity\neffect of this electrode with uncorrelated pairs in the pseudogap regime.\nConductance spectra measured between 2 and 86 K showed four different $I_c$\npair currents which were attributed to coherent pairs tunneling through the\nbarrier below 42 K, to fluctuating pairs current up to $\\sim$77 K, and to\nproximity pairs current between 77 and 84 K. All pair currents were suppressed\nunder magnetic fields, with two distinct decay parameters that originated in\nthe two different electrodes, with a significant suppression observed in the\npseudogap regime.\n", "  The physical state of the gas in the central 500 pc of NGC~5128 (the radio\ngalaxy Centaurus A - Cen A), was investigated using the far-infrared\nfine-structure lines of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, as well as the CO(4-3)\nmolecular line. The circumnuclear disk (CND) is traced by emission from dust\nand the neutral gas ([CI] and CO). A gas outflow with a line-of-sight velocity\nof 60 km/s is evident in both species. The center of the CND is bright in [OI],\n[OIII], and [CII]; [OI]63mu emission dominates that of [CII] even though it is\nabsorbed with optical depths of 1.0-1.5. The outflow is well-traced by the\n[NII] and [NIII] lines and also seen in the [CII] and [OIII] lines that peak in\nthe center. Ionized gas densities are moderate in the CND and low everywhere\nelse. Neutral gas densities range from 4000 per cm3 (outflow, extended thin\ndisk ETD) to 20 000 per cm3 (CND). The CND radiation field is weak compared to\nthe ETD starburst field. The outflow has a much stronger radiation field. The\ntotal mass of all the CND gas is 9 x 10^(7) M(o) and the mass of the outflowing\ngas is only 15%-30% of that. The outflow most likely originates from the\nshock-dominated CND cavity surrounding the central black hole. With a factor of\nthree uncertainty, the mass outflow rate is about 2 M(o)/yr, a thousand times\nhigher than the accretion rate of the black hole. Without replenishment, the\nCND will be depleted in 15-120 million years. However, the outflow velocity is\nwell below the escape velocity.\n", "  We illuminate the intriguing role played by spatial anisotropy in\nthree-dimensional Luttinger semimetals featuring quadratic band touching and\nlong-range Coulomb interactions. We observe the anisotropy to be subject to an\nexceptionally slow renormalization group (RG) evolution so that it can be\nconsidered approximately constant when computing the impact of quantum\nfluctuations on the remaining couplings of the system. Using perturbative RG we\nthen study the competition of all local short-range interactions that are\ngenerated from the long-range interactions for fixed anisotropy. Two main\neffects come to light for sufficiently strong anisotropy. First, the\nthree-dimensional system features an Abrikosov non-Fermi liquid ground state.\nSecond, there appear qualitatively new fixed points which describe quantum\nphase transitions into phases with nemagnetic orders - higher-rank tensor\norders that break time-reversal symmetry, and thus have both nematic and\nmagnetic character. In real materials these phases may be realized through\nsufficiently strong microscopic short-range interactions. On the pyrochlore\nlattice, the anisotropy-induced fixed points determine the onset of\nall-in-all-out or spin ice ordering of local magnetic moments of the electrons.\n", "  The double-detonation explosion model has been considered a candidate for\nexplaining astrophysical transients with a wide range of luminosities. In this\nmodel, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a\nsurface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is\nthe presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface\nhelium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the\noptical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation\nmodels. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the\nHe I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion\nsimulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the\nnear-infrared 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double\ndetonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This\nmodel has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\\odot}$ and our\ncalculations suggest that the 2 $\\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but\nthat the 10830 \\AA~feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta.\nConsequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nexpected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum\nlight. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model\n($\\sim 19,000$~km~s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nconfused or blended with the C I 10690~\\AA~line forming at lower velocities. We\nalso present calculations for the He I 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines for a lower\nmass (low luminosity) double detonation model, which has a post-explosion He\nmass of 0.077 $M_{\\odot}$. In this case, both the He I features we consider are\nstrong and can provide a clear observational signature of the double-detonation\nmechanism.\n", "  The Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM) is a low energy\nalternative to the MSSM with an extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and three\ngenerations of matter filling complete 27-plet representations of $E_6$. This\nprovides both new D and F term contributions that raise the Higgs mass at tree\nlevel, and a compelling solution to the $\\mu$-problem of the MSSM by forbidding\nsuch a term with the extra $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead, an effective $\\mu$-term is\ngenerated from the VEV of an SM singlet which breaks the extra $U(1)$ symmetry\nat low energies, giving rise to a massive $Z^\\prime$. We explore the\nphenomenology of the constrained version of this model (cE$_6$SSM) in\nsubstantially more detail than has been carried out previously, performing a\nten dimensional scan that reveals a large volume of viable parameter space. We\nclassify the different mechanisms for generating the measured relic density of\ndark matter found in the scan, including the identification of a new mechanism\ninvolving mixed bino/inert-Higgsino dark matter. We show which mechanisms can\nevade the latest direct detection limits from the LUX 2016 experiment. Finally\nwe present benchmarks consistent with all the experimental constraints and\nwhich could be discovered with the XENON1T experiment.\n", "  A symmetry-protected topological phase has nontrivial surface states in the\npresence of certain symmetries, which can either be gapless or be degenerate.\nIn this work, we study the physical consequence of such gapless surface states\nat the bulk quantum phase transition (QPT) that spontaneously breaks these\nsymmetries. The two-dimensional Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki phase on a square\nlattice and its QPTs to N\\'eel ordered phases are realized with the spin-$1/2$\nHeisenberg model on a decorated square lattice. With large-scale quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations, we show that even though the bulk QPTs are governed by the\nconventional Landau phase transition theory, the gapless surface state induces\nunconventional universality classes of the surface critical behaviors.\n", "  We investigate a new constraint on new-physics interpretations of the\nanomalies observed in $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ decays making use of the lifetime\nof the $B_c^-$ meson. A constraint is obtained by demanding that the rate for\n$B_c^-\\to\\tau^-\\bar\\nu$ does not exceed the fraction of the total width that is\nallowed by the calculation of the lifetime in the standard model. This leads to\na very strong bound on new-physics scenarios involving scalar operators since\nthey lift the slight, but not negligible, chiral suppression of the\n$B_c^-\\to\\tau^-\\bar\\nu$ amplitude in the standard model. The new constraint\nrenders a scalar interpretation of the enhancement measured in $R_{D^*}$\nimplausible, including explanations implementing extra Higgs doublets or\ncertain classes of leptoquarks. We also discuss the complementarity of\n$R_{D^{(*)}}$ and a measurement of the longitudinal polarization of the $\\tau$\nin the $B\\to D^*\\tau\\nu$ decay in light of our findings.\n", "  It is argued that final state enhancements in production reactions at large\nmomentum transfers, such as pp -> K^+ Lambda p, are primarily sensitive to the\nposition of a virtual bound state pole in the Lambda p system rather than the\nLambda p scattering length and effective range. These arguments are supported\nby a study of the dispersion relation derived to describe such processes as a\nfunction of the cut-off energy. This shows that the position of the virtual\nbound state is independent of the cut-off energy.\n", "  The dynamics of a two-dimensional superconductor under a constant electric\nfield $E$ is studied by using the gauge/gravity correspondence. The pair\nbreaking current induced by $E$ first increases to a peak value and then\ndecreases to a constant value at late time, where the superconducting gap goes\nto zero, corresponding to a normal conducting phase. The peak value of the\ncurrent is found to increase linearly with respect to the electric field.\nMoreover, the nonlinear conductivity, defined as an average of the conductivity\nin the superconducting phase, scales as $\\sim E^{-2/3}$ for large $E$ when the\nsystem is close to the critical temperature, which agrees with predictions from\nsolving the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.\n", "  Simulations suggest collisionless steady-state magnetic reconnection of\nHarris-type current sheets proceeds with a rate of order 0.1, independent of\ndissipation mechanism. We argue this long-standing puzzle is a result of\nconstraints at the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scale. We perform a scaling\nanalysis of the reconnection rate as a function of the opening angle made by\nthe upstream magnetic fields, finding a maximum reconnection rate close to 0.2.\nThe predictions compare favorably to particle-in-cell simulations of\nrelativistic electron-positron and non-relativistic electron-proton\nreconnection. The fact that simulated reconnection rates are close to the\npredicted maximum suggests reconnection proceeds near the most efficient state\nallowed at the MHD-scale. The rate near the maximum is relatively insensitive\nto the opening angle, potentially explaining why reconnection has a similar\nfast rate in differing models.\n", "  We present updated results on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and\naxial coupling calculated using CLS ensembles with $N_\\mathrm{f}=2+1$ dynamical\nflavours of Wilson fermions. The measurements are performed on large, fine\nlattices with a pseudoscalar mass reaching down to 200 MeV. The\ntruncated-solver method is employed to reduce the variance of the measurements.\nEstimation of the matrix elements is challenging due to large contamination\nfrom excited states and further investigation is necessary to bring these\neffects under control.\n", "  The Chern-Simons axion coupling of a bulk insulator is only defined modulo a\nquantum of e^2/h. The quantized part of the coupling is uniquely defined for a\nbounded insulating sample, but it depends on the specific surface termination.\nWorking in a slab geometry and representing the valence bands in terms of\nhybrid Wannier functions, we show how to determine that quantized part from the\nexcess Chern number of the hybrid Wannier sheets located near the surface of\nthe slab. The procedure is illustrated for a tight-binding model consisting of\ncoupled quantum anomalous Hall layers. By slowly modulating the model\nparameters, it is possible to transfer one unit of Chern number from the bottom\nto the top surface over the course of a cyclic evolution of the bulk\nHamiltonian. When the evolution of the surface Hamiltonian is also cyclic, the\nChern pumping is obstructed by chiral touchings between valence and conduction\nsurface bands.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling in organic crystals is responsible for many\nspin-relaxation phenomena, going from spin diffusion to intersystem crossing.\nWith the goal of constructing effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians to be used in\nmultiscale approaches to the thermodynamical properties of organic crystals, we\npresent a method that combines density functional theory with the construction\nof Wannier functions. In particular we show that the spin-orbit Hamiltonian\nconstructed over maximally localised Wannier functions can be computed by\ndirect evaluation of the spin-orbit matrix elements over the Wannier functions\nconstructed in absence of spin-orbit interaction. This eliminates the prob- lem\nof computing the Wannier functions for almost degenerate bands, a problem\nalways present with the spin-orbit-split bands of organic crystals. Examples of\nthe method are presented for isolated molecules, for mono-dimensional chains of\nPb and C atoms and for triarylamine-based one-dimansional single crystals.\n", "  We demonstrate that the leading and next-to-leading finite-volume effects in\nthe evaluation of leptonic decay widths of pseudoscalar mesons at $O(\\alpha)$\nare universal, i.e. they are independent of the structure of the meson. This is\nanalogous to a similar result for the spectrum but with some fundamental\ndifferences, most notably the presence of infrared divergences in decay\namplitudes. The leading non-universal, structure-dependent terms are of\n$O(1/L^2)$ (compared to the $O(1/L^3)$ leading non-universal corrections in the\nspectrum). We calculate the universal finite-volume effects, which requires an\nextension of previously developed techniques to include a dependence on an\nexternal three-momentum (in our case, the momentum of the final state lepton).\nThe result can be included in the strategy proposed in\nRef.\\,\\cite{Carrasco:2015xwa} for using lattice simulations to compute the\ndecay widths at $O(\\alpha)$, with the remaining finite-volume effects starting\nat order $O(1/L^2)$. The methods developed in this paper can be generalised to\nother decay processes, most notably to semileptonic decays, and hence open the\npossibility of a new era in precision flavour physics.\n", "  We study quantum quenches in the XXZ spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain from\nfamilies of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic initial states. Using Bethe\nansatz techniques, we compute short-range correlators in the complete\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble (GGE), which takes into account all local and\nquasi-local conservation laws. We compare our results to exact diagonalization\nand numerical linked cluster expansion calculations for the diagonal ensemble\nfinding excellent agreement and thus providing a very accurate test for the\nvalidity of the complete GGE. Furthermore, we compute the diagonal entropy in\nthe post-quench steady state. By careful finite-size scaling analyses of the\nexact diagonalization results, we show that the diagonal entropy is equal to\none half the Yang-Yang entropy corresponding to the complete GGE. Finally, the\ncomplete GGE is quantitatively contrasted with the GGE built using only the\nlocal conserved charges (local GGE). The predictions of the two ensembles are\nfound to differ significantly in the case of ferromagnetic initial states. Such\ninitial states are better suited than others considered in the literature to\nexperimentally test the validity of the complete GGE and contrast it to the\nfailure of the local GGE.\n", "  In 1969 Leighton developed a quasi-1D mathematical model of the solar dynamo,\nbuilding upon the phenomenological scenario of Babcock(1961). Here we present a\nmodification and extension of Leighton's model. Using the axisymmetric\ncomponent of the magnetic field, we consider the radial field component at the\nsolar surface and the radially integrated toroidal magnetic flux in the\nconvection zone, both as functions of latitude. No assumptions are made with\nregard to the radial location of the toroidal flux. The model includes the\neffects of turbulent diffusion at the surface and in the convection zone,\npoleward meridional flow at the surface and an equatorward return flow\naffecting the toroidal flux, latitudinal differential rotation and the\nnear-surface layer of radial rotational shear, downward convective pumping of\nmagnetic flux in the shear layer, and flux emergence in the form of tilted\nbipolar magnetic regions. While the parameters relevant for the transport of\nthe surface field are taken from observations, the model condenses the unknown\nproperties of magnetic field and flow in the convection zone into a few free\nparameters (turbulent diffusivity, effective return flow, amplitude of the\nsource term, and a parameter describing the effective radial shear). Comparison\nwith the results of two-dimensional flux transport dynamo codes shows that the\nmodel captures the essential features of these simulations. We carry out a\nparameter study over the four-dimensional parameter space and identify the\nparameter ranges that provide solar-like solutions. Dipole parity is always\npreferred and solutions with periods around 22 years and a correct phase\ndifference between flux emergence in low latitudes and the strength of the\npolar fields are found for a return flow speed around 2~m/s, turbulent\ndiffusivity <80~km^2/s, and dynamo excitation not too far above the threshold\n(linear growth rate <0.1/yr).\n", "  Our goal is to study the evolution of the $B-$band luminosity function (LF)\nsince $z=1$ using ALHAMBRA data. We used the photometric redshift and the\n$I-$band selection magnitude probability distribution functions (PDFs) of those\nALHAMBRA galaxies with $I\\leq24$ mag to compute the posterior LF. We\nstatistically studied quiescent and star-forming galaxies using the template\ninformation encoded in the PDFs. The LF covariance matrix in\nredshift-magnitude-galaxy type space was computed, including the cosmic\nvariance. That was estimated from the intrinsic dispersion of the LF\nmeasurements in the 48 ALHAMBRA sub-fields. The uncertainty due to the\nphotometric redshift prior is also included in our analysis. We modelled the LF\nwith a redshift-dependent Schechter function affected by the same selection\neffects than the data. The measured ALHAMBRA LF at $0.2\\leq z<1$ and the\nevolving Schechter parameters both for quiescent and star-forming galaxies\nagree with previous results in the literature. The estimated redshift evolution\nof $M_B^* \\propto Qz$ is $Q_{\\rm SF}=-1.03\\pm0.08$ and $Q_{\\rm\nQ}=-0.80\\pm0.08$, and of $\\log \\phi^* \\propto Pz$ is $P_{\\rm SF}=-0.01\\pm0.03$\nand $P_{\\rm Q}=-0.41\\pm0.05$. The measured faint-end slopes are $\\alpha_{\\rm\nSF}=-1.29\\pm0.02$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm Q}=-0.53\\pm0.04$. We find a significant\npopulation of faint quiescent galaxies, modelled by a second Schechter function\nwith slope $\\beta=-1.31\\pm0.11$. We find a factor $2.55\\pm0.14$ decrease in the\nluminosity density $j_B$ of star-forming galaxies, and a factor $1.25\\pm0.16$\nincrease in the $j_B$ of quiescent ones since $z=1$, confirming the continuous\nbuild-up of the quiescent population with cosmic time. The contribution of the\nfaint quiescent population to $j_B$ increases from 3% at $z=1$ to 6% at $z=0$.\nThe developed methodology will be applied to future multi-filter surveys such\nas J-PAS.\n", "  In this work we show that there is a direct relationship between a graph's\ntopology and the free energy of a spin system on the graph. We develop a method\nof separating topological and enthalpic contributions to the free energy, and\nfind that considering the topology is sufficient to qualitatively compare the\nfree energies of different graph systems at high temperature, even when the\nenergetics are not fully known. This method was applied to the metal lattice\nsystem with defects, and we found that it partially explains why point defects\nare more stable than high-dimensional defects. Given the energetics, we can\neven quantitatively compare free energies of different graph structures via a\nclosed form of linear graph contributions. The closed form is applied to\npredict the sequence space free energy of lattice proteins, which is a key\nfactor determining the designability of a protein structure.\n", "  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are among the best\nmotivated dark matter (DM) candidates, could make up all or only a fraction of\nthe total DM budget. We consider a scenario in which WIMPs are a sub-dominant\nDM component; such a scenario would affect both current direct and indirect\nbounds on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section. In this paper we focus on\nindirect searches for the neutrino flux produced by annihilation of\nsub-dominant WIMPs captured by the Sun or the Earth via either spin-dependent\nor spin-independent scattering. We derive the annihilation rate and the\nexpected neutrino flux at neutrino observatories. In our computation, we\ninclude an updated chemical composition of the Earth with respect to the\nprevious literature, leading to an increase of the Earth's capture rate for\nspin-dependent scattering by a factor three. Results are compared with current\nbounds from Super-Kamiokande and IceCube. We discuss the scaling of bounds from\nboth direct and indirect detection methods with the WIMP abundance.\n", "  We propose an analytical model describing Fermi arc surface states observed\nin the recent investigations of Weyl semimetals. The effective two-valley\nHamiltonian is supplemented by the boundary conditions taking into account both\nthe intravalley and intervalley interfacial interaction. We demonstrate that\nthe latter is crucial for the formation of the surface states having the form\nconsistent with the experimental data. Depending on the magnitude and interplay\nbetween the intravalley and intervalley interactions, the Fermi arc connects\ntwo nearby or distant valleys. Moreover, the emergence of additional Fermi\ncontours (closed curves not intersecting the Weil points) can be understood in\nthe simplest four-valley approximation. These results open the opportunities\nfor search of new effects in Weyl semimetals under the external fields.\n", "  We study the effect of the electron-phonon coupling on vibrational eigenmodes\nof nano- and micro-mechanical systems made of semiconductors with equivalent\nenergy valleys. We show that the coupling can lead to a strong mode\nnonlinearity. The mechanism is the lifting of the valley degeneracy by the\nstrain. The redistribution of the electrons between the valleys is controlled\nby a large ratio of the electron-phonon coupling constant to the electron\nchemical potential or temperature. We find the quartic in the strain terms in\nthe electron free energy, which determine the amplitude dependence of the mode\nfrequencies. This dependence is calculated for silicon micro-systems. It is\nsignificantly different for different modes and the crystal orientation, and\ncan vary nonmonotonously with the electron density and temperature.\n", "  We cast the problem of illuminating an object in a noisy environment into a\ncommunication protocol. A probe is sent into the environment, and the presence\nor absence of the object constitutes a signal encoded on the probe. The probe\nis then measured to decode the signal. We calculate the Holevo information and\nbounds to the accessible information between the encoded and received signal\nwith two different Gaussian probes---an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state and\na coherent state. We also evaluate the Gaussian discord consumed during the\nencoding process with the EPR probe. We find that the Holevo quantum advantage,\ndefined as the difference between the Holevo information obtained from the EPR\nand coherent state probes, is approximately equal to the discord consumed.\nThese quantities become exact in the typical illumination regime of low object\nreflectivity and low probe energy. Hence we show that discord is the resource\nresponsible for the quantum advantage in Gaussian quantum illumination.\n", "  In order to construct a gauge invariant two-point function in a Yang-Mills\ntheory, we propose the use of the all-order gauge invariant transverse\nconfigurations A^h. Such configurations can be obtained through the\nminimization of the functional A^2_{min} along the gauge orbit within the BRST\ninvariant formulation of the Gribov-Zwanziger framework recently put forward in\n[1,2] for the class of the linear covariant gauges. This correlator turns out\nto provide a characterization of non-perturbative aspects of the theory in a\nBRST invariant and gauge parameter independent way. In particular, it turns out\nthat the poles of <A^h A^h> are the same as those of the transverse part of the\ngluon propagator, which are also formally shown to be independent of the gauge\nparameter entering the gauge condition through the Nielsen identities. The\nlatter follow from the new exact BRST invariant formulation introduced before.\nMoreover, the correlator <A^h A^h> enables us to attach a BRST invariant\nmeaning to the possible positivity violation of the corresponding temporal\nSchwinger correlator, giving thus for the first time a consistent, gauge\nparameter independent, setup to adopt the positivity violation of <A^h A^h> as\na signature for gluon confinement. Finally, in the context of gauge theories\nsupplemented with a fundamental Higgs field, we use <A^h A^h> to probe the pole\nstructure of the massive gauge boson in a gauge invariant fashion.\n", "  Recent experiments revealed intriguing similarities in the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{207}$Pb, $^{132}$Xe+$^{208}$Pb, and $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U reactions\nat energies around the Coulomb barrier. The experimental data indicate that for\nall systems substantial energy dissipation takes place, in the first stage of\nthe reaction, although the number of transferred nucleons is small. On the\nother hand, in the second stage, a large number of nucleons are transferred\nwith small friction and small consumption of time. To understand the observed\nbehavior, various reactions were analyzed based on the microscopic\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. From a systematic analysis for\n$^{40,48}$Ca+$^{124}$Sn, $^{40}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb, $^{40}$Ar+$^{208}$Pb,\n$^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb, $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U, $^{136}$Xe+ $^{198}$Pt, and\n$^{238}$U+$^{238}$U reactions, we find that TDHF reproduces well the measured\ntrends. In addition, the Balian-V\\'en\\'eroni variational principle is applied\nto head-on collisions of $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U, and the variance of the fragment\nmasses is compared with the experimental data, showing significant improvement.\nThe underlying reaction mechanisms and possible future studies are discussed.\n", "  Non-locality is one of the most striking signatures of the topological nature\nof Weyl semimetals. We propose to probe the non-locality in these materials via\na measurement of a magnetic field dependent Coulomb drag between two sheets of\ngraphene which are separated by a three-dimensional slab of Weyl semimetal. We\npredict a new mechanism of Coulomb drag, based on cyclotron orbits that are\nsplit between opposite surfaces of the semi-metal. In the absence of impurity\nscattering between different Weyl nodes, this mechanism does not decay with the\nthickness of the semi-metal.\n", "  We propose a new technique to study fast transitions during inflation, by\nstudying the dynamics of quantum quenches in an $O(N)$ scalar field theory in\nde Sitter spacetime. We compute the time evolution of the system using a\nnon-perturbative large-$N$ limit approach. We derive the self-consistent mass\nequation for several physically relevant transitions of the parameters of the\ntheory, in a slow motion approximation. Our computations reveal that the\neffective mass after the quench evolves in the direction of recovering its\nvalue before the quench, but stopping at a different asymptotic value, in which\nthe mass squared is strictly positive. Furthermore, we tentatively find\nsituations in which the effective mass squared can be temporarily negative,\nthus breaking the $O(N)$ symmetry of the system for a certain time, only to\nthen come back to a positive value, restoring the symmetry. We argue the\nrelevance of our new method in a cosmological scenario.\n", "  [abridged] In large-scale time-domain surveys, the processing of data, from\nprocurement up to the detection of sources, is generally automated. One of the\nmain challenges is contamination by artifacts, especially in regions of strong\nunresolved emission. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for\nvariables and transients from the outputs of such surveys' data pipelines. We\nuse the method to systematically search for novae in iPTF observations of the\nbulge of M31. We demonstrate that most artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline\nform a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying\nPoissonian statistics, whereas genuine variables and transients as well as\nartifacts associated with bright stars result in clusters of detections, whose\nspread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the\nproblem analogous to source detection on images produced by X-ray telescopes,\nenabling one to utilize tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we\nuse a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis\npackage CIAO. Starting from ~2.5x10^5 raw detections made by the iPTF data\npipeline, we obtain ~4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these\ncandidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image, we find\ncounterparts for ~90% of them. These are either artifacts due to imperfect PSF\nmatching or genuine variable sources. The remaining ~400 detections are\ntransient sources. We identify novae among these candidates by applying\nselection cuts based on the expected properties of nova lightcurves. Thus, we\nrecovered all 12 known novae registered during the time span of the survey and\ndiscovered three nova candidates. Our method is generic and can be applied for\nmining any target out of the artifacts in optical time-domain data. As it is\nfully automated, its incompleteness can be accurately computed and corrected\nfor.\n", "  Kinetically-constrained models are lattice-gas models that are used for\ndescribing glassy systems. By construction, their equilibrium state is trivial\nand there are no equal-time correlations between the occupancy of different\nsites. We drive such models out of equilibrium by connecting them to two\nreservoirs of different densities, and measure the response of the system to\nthis perturbation. We find that under the proper coarse-graining, the behavior\nof these models may be expressed by a nonlinear diffusion equation, with a\nmodel- and density-dependent diffusion coefficient. We find a simple\napproximation for the diffusion coefficient, and show that the relatively mild\ndiscrepancy between the approximation and our numerical results arises due to\nnon-negligible correlations that appear as the system is driven out of\nequilibrium, even when the density gradient is infinitesimally small. Similar\ncorrelations appear when such kinetically-constrained models are driven out of\nequilibrium by applying a uniform external force. We suggest that these\ncorrelations are the reason for the same discrepancy between the approximate\ndiffusion coefficient and the numerical results for a broader group of models,\nnon-gradient lattice-gas models, for which kinetically-constrained models are\narguably the simplest example thereof.\n", "  In this paper we present a new set of asymptotic boundary conditions for\nEinstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions with vanishing cosmological constant that\nare a generalization of the Barnich-Comp{\\`e}re boundary conditions\ngr-qc/0610130. These new boundary conditions lead to an asymptotic symmetry\nalgebra that is generated by a $\\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra and two affine\n$\\hat{\\mathfrak{u}}(1)$ current algebras. We then apply these boundary\nconditions to Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) and determine how the\npresence of the gravitational Chern-Simons term affects the central extensions\nof the asymptotic symmetry algebra. We furthermore determine the thermal\nentropy of solutions obeying our new boundary conditions for both Einstein\ngravity and TMG.\n", "  Globules and pillars, impressively revealed by the Spitzer and Herschel\nsatellites, for example, are pervasive features found in regions of massive\nstar formation. We studied the globule IRAS 20319+3958 in Cygnus X by means of\nvisible and near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, complemented with\nmid-infrared Spitzer/IRAC imaging, in order to obtain a census of its stellar\ncontent and the nature of its embedded sources. Our observations show that the\nglobule contains an embedded aggregate of about 30 very young ($\\lesssim\n1$~Myr) stellar objects, for which we estimate a total mass of ~ 90 M_sun. The\nmost massive members are three systems containing early B-type stars. Two of\nthem most likely produced very compact HII regions, one of them being still\nhighly embedded and coinciding with a peak seen in emission lines\ncharacterising the photon dominated region (PDR). Two of these three systems\nare resolved binaries, and one of those contains a visible Herbig Be star. An\napproximate derivation of the mass function of the members of the aggregate\ngives hints of a slope at high masses shallower than the classical Salpeter\nslope, and a peak of the mass distribution at a mass higher than that at which\nthe widely adopted log-normal initial mass function peaks. The emission\ndistribution of H$_2$ and Br gamma, tracing the PDR and the ionised gas phase,\nrespectively, suggests that molecular gas is distributed as a shell around the\nembedded aggregate, filled with centrally-condensed ionised gas. Both, the\nmorphology and the low excitation of the HII region, indicate that the sources\nof ionisation are the B stars of the embedded aggregate, rather than the\nexternal UV field caused by the O stars of Cygnus OB2. The youth of the\nembedded cluster, combined with the isolation of the globule, suggests that\nstar formation in the globule was triggered by the passage of the ionisation\nfront.\n", "  Ab initio modeling of electrochemical systems is becoming a key tool for\nunderstanding and predicting electrochemical behavior. Development and careful\nbenchmarking of computational electrochemical methods are essential to ensure\ntheir accuracy. Here, using charging curves for an electrode in the presence of\nan inert aqueous electrolyte, we demonstrate that most continuum models, which\nare parameterized and benchmarked for molecules, anions, and cations in\nsolution, undersolvate metal surfaces, and underestimate the surface charge as\na function of applied potential. We examine features of the electrolyte and\ninterface that are captured by these models, and identify improvements\nnecessary for realistic electrochemical calculations of metal surfaces.\nFinally, we reparameterize popular solvation models using the surface charge of\nAg(100) as a function of voltage to find improved accuracy for metal surfaces\nwithout significant change in utility for molecular and ionic solvation.\n", "  In this paper, we compute the first set of ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ corrections\nto semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering structure functions. We start by\nstudying the impact of the contribution of the partonic subprocesses that open\nat this order for the longitudinal structure function. We perform the full\ncalculation analytically, and obtain the expression of the factorized cross\nsection at this order. Special care is given to the study of their flavour\ndecomposition structure. We analyze the phenomenological effect of the\ncorrections finding that, even though expected to be small a priori, it turns\nout to be sizable with respect to the previous order know, calling for a full\nNNLO calculation.\n", "  We present a theoretical study based upon quantum Monte Carlo methods of the\nBose polaron in one-dimensional systems with contact interactions. In this\ninstance of the problem of a single impurity immersed in a quantum bath, the\nmedium is a Lieb-Liniger gas of bosons ranging from the weakly interacting to\nthe Tonks-Girardeau regime, whereas the impurity is coupled to the bath via a\ndifferent contact potential producing both repulsive and attractive\ninteractions. Both the case of a mobile impurity, having the same mass as the\nparticles in the medium, and of a static impurity with infinite mass are\nconsidered. We make use of exact numerical techniques that allow us to\ncalculate the ground-state energy of the impurity, its effective mass as well\nas the contact parameter between the impurity and the bath. These quantities\nare investigated as a function of the strength of interactions between the\nimpurity and the bath and within the bath. In particular, we find that the\neffective mass rapidly increases to very large values when the impurity gets\nstrongly coupled to an otherwise weakly repulsive bath. This heavy impurity\nhardly moves within the medium, thereby realizing the \"self-localization\"\nregime of the Landau-Pekar polaron. Furthermore, we compare our results with\npredictions of perturbation theory valid for weak interactions and with exact\nsolutions available when the bosons in the medium behave as impenetrable\nparticles.\n", "  Suppression of electron motion under an alternating current (AC) electric\nfield is examined in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. Utilizing three\ncomplementary calculation methods, it is found unambiguously that magnitudes of\nthe kinetic-energy suppressions are influenced sensitively by the Coulomb\ninteraction as well as the electron density. The phase and frequency in the AC\nfield do not bring about major effects. The results are interpreted as a\ncombined effect of the Coulomb interaction and the AC field, and provide a\nguiding principle for the photocontrol of correlated electron motion.\n", "  Aims. To investigate the mid-infrared (MIR) characteristics of Saturn's\nrings. Methods. We collected and analyzed MIR high spatial resolution images of\nSaturn's rings obtained in January 2008 and April 2005 with COMICS mounted on\nSubaru Telescope, and investigated the spatial variation in the surface\nbrightness of the rings in multiple bands in the MIR. We also composed the\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the C, B, and A rings and the Cassini\nDivision, and estimated the temperatures of the rings from the SEDs assuming\nthe optical depths. Results. We find that the C ring and the Cassini Division\nwere warmer than the B and A rings in 2008, which could be accounted for by\ntheir lower albedos, lower optical depths, and smaller self-shadowing effect.\nWe also find that the C ring and the Cassini Division were considerably\nbrighter than the B and A rings in the MIR in 2008 and the radial contrast of\nthe ring brightness is the inverse of that in 2005, which is interpreted as a\nresult of a seasonal effect with changing elevations of the sun and observer\nabove the ring plane.\n", "  The Galactic supernova remnant Kes 78 is surrounded by dense molecular\nclouds, whose projected position overlaps with the extended HESS gamma-ray\nsource HESS J1852-000. The X-ray emission from the remnant has been recently\nrevealed by Suzaku observations, which have shown indications for a hard X-ray\ncomponent in the spectra, possibly associated with synchrotron radiation. We\naim at describing the spatial distribution of the physical properties of the\nX-ray emitting plasma and at revealing the effects of the interaction of the\nremnant with the inhomogeneous ambient medium. We also aim at investigating the\norigin of the gamma-ray emission, which may be Inverse Compton radiation\nassociated with X-ray synchrotron emitting electrons or hadronic emission\noriginating from the impact of high energy protons on the nearby clouds. We\nanalyzed an XMM-Newton EPIC observation of Kes 78 by performing image analysis\nand spatially resolved spectral analysis on a set of three regions. We tested\nour findings against the observations of the 12CO and 13CO emission in the\nenvironment of the remnant. We revealed the complex X-ray morphology of Kes 78\nand found variations of the spectral properties of the plasma, with\nsignificantly denser and cooler material at the eastern edge of the remnant,\nwhich we interpret as a signature of interaction with a molecular cloud. We\nalso exclude the presence of narrow filaments emitting X-ray synchrotron\nradiation. Assuming that the very high energy gamma-ray emission is associated\nwith Kes 78, the lack of synchrotron emission rules out a leptonic origin. A\nhadronic origin is further supported by evidence for interaction of the remnant\nwith a dense molecular cloud in its eastern limb.\n", "  Hyperuniform systems, which include crystals, quasicrystals and special\ndisordered systems, have attracted considerable recent attention, but rigorous\nanalyses of the hyperuniformity of quasicrystals have been lacking because the\nsupport of the spectral intensity is dense and discontinuous. We employ the\nintegrated spectral intensity, $Z(k)$, to quantitatively characterize the\nhyperuniformity of quasicrystalline point sets generated by projection methods.\nThe scaling of $Z(k)$ as $k$ tends to zero is computed for one-dimensional\nquasicrystals and shown to be consistent with independent calculations of the\nvariance, $\\sigma^2(R)$, in the number of points contained in an interval of\nlength $2R$. We find that one-dimensional quasicrystals produced by projection\nfrom a two-dimensional lattice onto a line of slope $1/\\tau$ fall into distinct\nclasses determined by the width of the projection window. For a countable dense\nset of widths, $Z(k) \\sim k^4$; for all others, $Z(k)\\sim k^2$. This\ndistinction suggests that measures of hyperuniformity define new classes of\nquasicrystals in higher dimensions as well.\n", "  We study non-Markovian effects present in a driven qubit coupled to a finite\nenvironment using a recently proposed model developed in the context of\ncalorimetric measurements of open quantum systems. To quantify the degree of\nnon-Markovianity we use the Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) measure [Breuer \\textit{et\nal.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{103}, 210401 (2009)]. We show that information\nbackflow only occurs in the case of driving in which case we investigate the\ndependence of memory effects on the environment size, driving amplitude and\ncoupling to the environment. We show that the degree of non-Markovianity\nstrongly depends on the ratio between the driving amplitude and the coupling\nstrength. We also show that the degree of non-Markovianity does not decrease\nmonotonically as a function of the environment size.\n", "  We explored the sparticle mass spectrum in light of the muon g-2 anomaly and\nthe little hierarchy problem in a class of gauge mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking model. Here the messenger fields transform in the adjoint\nrepresentation of the Standard Model gauge symmetry. To avoid unacceptably\nlight right-handed slepton masses the standard model is supplemented by\nadditional U(1)_B-L gauge symmetry. Considering a non-zero U(1)_B-L D-term\nleads to an additional contribution to the soft supersymmetry breaking mass\nterms which makes the right-handed slepton masses compatible with the current\nexperimental bounds. We show that in the framework of Lambda_{3}<0 and mu < 0,\nthe muon g-2 anomaly and the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson mass a can be\nsimultaneously accommodated. The slepton masses in this case are predicted to\nlie in the few hundred GeV range, which can be tested at LHC. Despite the heavy\ncolored spectrum the the little hierarchy problem in this model can be\nameliorated and electroweak fine tuning parameter can be as low as 10 or so.\n", "  We establish purely geometric or metric-based criteria for the validity of\nthe separate universe ansatz, under which the evolution of small-scale\nobservables in a long-wavelength perturbation is indistinguishable from a\nseparate Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology in their angle average. In order\nto be able to identify the local volume expansion and curvature in a\nlong-wavelength perturbation with those of the separate universe, we show that\nthe lapse perturbation must be much smaller in amplitude than the curvature\npotential on a time slicing that comoves with the Einstein tensor. Interpreting\nthe Einstein tensor as an effective stress energy tensor, the condition is that\nthe effective stress energy comoves with freely falling synchronous observers\nwho establish the local expansion, so that the local curvature is conserved. By\nmatching the expansion history of these synchronous observers in cosmological\nsimulations, one can establish and test consistency relations even in the\nnonlinear regime of modified gravity theories.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) to explore the\nelectronic structure of single crystals of FeSe over a wide range of binding\nenergies and study the effects of strong electron-electron correlations. We\nprovide evidence for the existence of \"Hubbard-like bands\" at high binding\nenergies consisting of incoherent many-body excitations originating from Fe\n$3d$ states in addition to the renormalized quasiparticle bands near the Fermi\nlevel. Many high energy features of the observed ARPES data can be accounted\nfor when incorporating effects of strong local Coulomb interactions in\ncalculations of the spectral function via dynamical mean-field theory,\nincluding the formation of a Hubbard-like band. This shows that over the energy\nscale of several eV, local correlations arising from the on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion and Hund's coupling are essential for a proper understanding of the\nelectronic structure of FeSe and other related iron based superconductors.\n", "  We derive the constitutive equations of an active polar gel from a model for\nthe dynamics of elastic molecules that link polar elements. Molecular binding\nkinetics induces the fluidization of the material, giving rise to Maxwell\nviscoelasticity and, provided that detailed balance is broken, to the\ngeneration of active stresses. We give explicit expressions for the transport\ncoefficients of active gels in terms of molecular properties, including\nnonlinear contributions on the departure from equilibrium. In particular, when\nactivity favors linker unbinding, we predict a decrease of viscosity with\nactivity - active thinning - of kinetic origin, which could explain some\nexperimental results on the cell cortex. By bridging the molecular and\nhydrodynamic scales, our results could help understand the interplay between\nmolecular perturbations and the mechanics of cells and tissues.\n", "  Context. This paper presents an overview of the photometric data that are\npart of the first Gaia data release. Aims. The principles of the processing and\nthe main characteristics of the Gaia photometric data are presented. Methods.\nThe calibration strategy is outlined briefly and the main properties of the\nresulting photometry are presented. Results. Relations with other broadband\nphotometric systems are provided. The overall precision for the Gaia photometry\nis shown to be at the milli-magnitude level and has a clear potential to\nimprove further in future releases.\n", "  We consider the gauge invariant Drell-Yan hadron tensor which includes the\nstandard and non-standard diagram contributions. The non-standard diagram\ncontribution is appeared owing to the complexity of the twist three\n$B^V(x_1,x_2)$-function where the gluon pole manifests. We use the contour\ngauge conception which allows us to fix easily the spurious uncertainties in\nthe gluon propagator. The contour gauge condition is generated by the\ncorresponding Wilson lines in both the standard and non-standard diagrams. We\ndemonstrate the substantial role of the non-standard diagram for forming of the\nrelevant contour in the Wilson path-ordered exponential that leads to the\nspurious singularity fixing.\n", "  The quark-meson model is often used as an effective low-energy model for QCD\nto study the chiral transition at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical\npotential $\\mu_B$. The parameters in the quark-meson model can be found by\nexpressing them in terms of the sigma mass $m_{\\sigma}$, the pion mass\n$m_{\\pi}$, the constituent quark mass $m_q$ and the pion decay constant\n$f_{\\pi}$. In practice, this matching is done at tree level, which is\ninconsistent once we take loop effects of the effective potential into account.\nWe show how to properly perform the matching in the quark-meson model by using\nthe on-shell and the modified minimal subtraction renormalization schemes\nrelating the physical masses and the pion decay constant to the running mass\nparameter and couplings. We map out the phase diagram in the $\\mu_B$--$T$ plane\nand compare our results with other approximations.\n", "  The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature provides an important distance\nscale for the measurement of the expansion history of the Universe. Theoretical\nmodels of the BAO in the distribution of biased tracers of the large scale\nstructure usually rely on an initially linear BAO. With aid of N-body\nsimulations, we demonstrate that the BAO in the initial (Lagrangian) halo\n2-point function is significantly sharper than in the linear matter\ndistribution, in agreement with peak theory. Using this approach, we delineate\nthe scale-dependence induced by the higher-derivative and velocity bias before\nassessing how much of the initial BAO enhancement survives until the collapse\nepoch. Finally, we discuss the extent to which the velocity or gravity bias,\nwhich is also imprinted in the displacement field of halos, affects the\ncontrast of the BAO obtained with a reconstruction.\n", "  This paper is the second in a series devoted to the study of Langevin systems\nsubjected to a continuous time-delayed feedback control. The goal of our\nprevious paper [Phys. Rev. E 91, 042114 (2015)] was to derive second-law-like\ninequalities that provide bounds to the average extracted work. Here we study\nstochastic fluctuations of time-integrated observables such as the heat\nexchanged with the environment, the extracted work, or the (apparent) entropy\nproduction. We use a path-integral formalism and focus on the long-time\nbehavior in the stationary cooling regime, stressing the role of rare events.\nThis is illustrated by a detailed analytical and numerical study of a Langevin\nharmonic oscillator driven by a linear feedback.\n", "  Abridged. The 12CO/13CO ratio in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has been extensively used as the tracer of\nthe photospheric 12C/13C ratio. However, spatially-resolved ALMA observations\nof R Scl, a carbon rich AGB star, have shown that the 12CO/13CO ratio is not\nconsistent over the entire CSE. Hence, it can not necessarily be used as a\ntracer of the 12C/13C ratio. The most likely hypothesis to explain the observed\ndiscrepancy between the 12CO/13CO and 12C/13C ratios is CO isotopologue\nselective photodissociation by UV radiation. Unlike the CO isotopologue ratio,\nthe HCN isotopologue ratio is not affected by UV radiation. Therefore, HCN\nisotopologue ratios can be used as the tracer of the atomic C ratio in UV\nirradiated regions. We have performed a detailed non-LTE excitation analysis of\ncircumstellar H12CN and H13CN line emission around R Scl, observed with ALMA\nand APEX, using a radiative transfer code, ALI. The spatial extent of the\nmolecular distribution for both isotopologues is constrained based on the\nspatially resolved H13CN(4-3) ALMA observations. We find fractional abundances\nof H12CN/H2 = (5.0 +\\- 2.0) x 10^{-5} and H13CN/H2 = (1.9 +\\- 0.4) x 10^{-6} in\nthe inner wind (r < (2.0 +\\- 0.25) x 10^{15} cm) of R Scl. The derived\ncircumstellar isotopologue ratio of H12CN/H13CN = 26.3 +\\- 11.9 is consistent\nwith the photospheric ratio of 12C/13C ~ 19 \\pm 6. We show that the\ncircumstellar H12CN/H13CN ratio traces the photospheric 12C/13C ratio. These\nresults support the previously proposed explanation that CO isotopologue\nselective-shielding is the main factor responsible for the observed discrepancy\nbetween 12C/13C and 12CO/13CO ratios in the inner CSE of R Scl. This indicates\nthat UV radiation impacts on the CO isotopologue ratio.\n", "  Gravitational lensing information from the two and higher point statistics of\nthe CMB temperature and polarization fields are intrinsically correlated\nbecause they are lensed by the same realization of structure between last\nscattering and observation. Using an analytic model for lens sample covariance,\nwe show that there is one mode, separately measurable in the lensed CMB power\nspectra and lensing reconstruction, that carries most of this correlation. Once\nthese measurements become lens sample variance dominated, this mode should\nprovide a useful consistency check between the observables that is largely free\nof sampling and cosmological parameter errors. Violations of consistency could\nindicate systematic errors in the data and lens reconstruction or new physics\nat last scattering, any of which could bias cosmological inferences and\ndelensing for gravitational waves. A second mode provides a weaker consistency\ncheck for a spatially flat universe. Our analysis isolates the additional\ninformation supplied by lensing in a model independent manner but is also\nuseful for understanding and forecasting CMB cosmological parameter errors in\nthe extended $\\Lambda$CDM parameter space of dark energy, curvature and massive\nneutrinos. We introduce and test a simple but accurate forecasting technique\nfor this purpose that neither double counts lensing information nor neglects\nlensing in the observables.\n", "  We study the magnetohydrodynamics of relativistic plasmas accounting for the\nchiral magnetic effect (CME). To take into account the evolution of the plasma\nvelocity, obeying the Navier-Stokes equation, we approximate it by the Lorentz\nforce accompanied by the phenomenological drag time parameter. On the basis of\nthis ansatz, we obtain the contributions of both the turbulence effects,\nresulting from the dynamo term, and the magnetic field instability, caused by\nthe CME, to the evolution of the magnetic field governed by the modified\nFaraday equation. In this way, we explore the evolution of the magnetic field\nenergy and the magnetic helicity density spectra in the early Universe plasma.\nWe find that the right-left electron asymmetry is enhanced by the turbulent\nplasma motion in a strong seed magnetic field compared to the pure the CME case\nstudied earlier for the hot Universe plasma in the same broken phase.\n", "  We construct a simple model of heavy ion collisions, local in the impact\nparameter plane, and appropriate for the SPS energy range. This model can be\nregarded as a new realization of the \"fire-streak\" approach, originally applied\nto studies of lower energy nucleus-nucleus reactions. Starting from local\nenergy and momentum conservation, we nicely describe the broadening of the pion\nrapidity distribution when going from central to peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=17.3 GeV. The results of our calculations are compared with SPS\nexperimental data. We discuss the resulting implications on the role of energy\nand momentum conservation for the dynamics of particle production in heavy ion\ncollisions. A specific space-time picture emerges, where the longitudinal\nevolution of the system strongly depends on the position in the impact\nparameter (${b_x}$, ${b_y}$) plane. This picture is consistent with our earlier\nfindings on the longitudinal evolution of the system as deduced from\nelectromagnetic effects on charged pion directed flow, and can provide an\nexplanation for specific low-$p_T$ phenomena seen in the fragmentation region\nof Pb+Pb collisions.\n", "  The Taubes equation for Abelian Higgs vortices is generalised to five\ndistinct U(1) vortex equations. These include the Popov and Jackiw--Pi vortex\nequations, and two new equations. The Baptista metric, a conformal rescaling of\nthe background metric by the squared Higgs field, gives insight into these\nvortices, and shows that vortices can be interpreted as conical singularities\nsuperposed on the background geometry. When the background has a constant\ncurvature adapted to the vortex type, then the vortex equation is integrable by\na reduction to Liouville's equation, and the Baptista metric has a constant\ncurvature too, apart from its conical singularities. The conical geometry is\nfairly easy to visualise in some cases.\n", "  The trimer resonating valence bond (tRVB) state consisting of an equal-weight\nsuperposition of trimer coverings on a square lattice is proposed. A model\nHamiltonian of the Rokhsar-Kivelson type for which the tRVB becomes the exact\nground state is written. The state is shown to have $9^g$ topological\ndegeneracy on genus g surface and support $Z_3$ vortex excitations. Correlation\nfunctions show exponential behavior with a very short correlation length\nconsistent with the gapped spectrum. The classical problem of the degeneracy of\ntrimer configurations is investigated by the transfer matrix method.\n", "  We discuss the procedure of different partitions in the finite set of $N$\ninteger numbers and construct generic formulas for a bijective map of real\nnumbers $s_y$, where $y=1,2,\\ldots,N$, $N=\\prod \\limits_{k=1}^{n} X_k$, and\n$X_k$ are positive integers, onto the set of numbers\n$s(y(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n))$. We give the functions used to present the bijective\nmap, namely, $y(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ and $x_k(y)$ in an explicit form and call\nthem the functions detecting the hidden correlations in the system. The idea to\nintroduce and employ the notion of \"hidden gates\" for a single qudit is\nproposed. We obtain the entropic-information inequalities for an arbitrary\nfinite set of real numbers and consider the inequalities for arbitrary\nClebsch--Gordan coefficients as an example of the found relations for real\nnumbers.\n", "  The matrix element method usually employs leading-order matrix elements. We\ndiscuss the generalisation towards higher orders in perturbation theory and\nshow how the matrix element method can be used at next-to-leading order for\narbitrary infrared-safe jet algorithms. We discuss three variants at\nnext-to-leading order. The first two variants work at the level of the jet\nmomenta. The first variant adheres to strict fixed-order in perturbation\ntheory. We present a method for the required integration over the radiation\nphase space. The second variant is inspired by the POWHEG method and works as\nthe first variant at the level of the jet momenta. The third variant is a more\nexclusive POWHEG version. Here we resolve exactly one jet into two sub-jets. If\nthe two sub-jets are resolved above a scale $p_\\bot^{\\mathrm{min}}$, the\nlikelihood is computed from the POWHEG-modified real emission part, otherwise\nit is given by the POWHEG-modified virtual part.\n", "  The effects of Rashba interaction and electromagnetic field on the edge\nstates of a two-dimensional topological insulator are investigated in a\nnon-perturbative way. We show that the electron dynamics is equivalent to a\nproblem of massless Dirac fermions propagating with an inhomogeneous velocity,\nenhanced by the Rashba profile with respect to the bare Fermi value $v_F$.\nDespite the inelastic and time-reversal breaking processes induced by the\nelectromagnetic field, no backscattering occurs without interaction. The\nphotoexcited electron densities are explicitly obtained in terms of the\nelectric field and the Rashba interaction, and are shown to fulfil generalised\nchiral anomaly equations. The case of a Gaussian electromagnetic pulse is\nanalysed in detail. When the photoexcitation occurs far from the Rashba region,\nthe latter effectively acts as a \"superluminal gate\" boosting the photoexcited\nwavepacket outside the light-cone determined by $v_F$. In contrast, for an\nelectric pulse overlapping the Rashba region the emerging wavepackets are\nsqueezed in a manner that depends on the overlap area. The electron-electron\ninteraction effects are also discussed, for both intra-spin and inter-spin\ndensity-density coupling. The results suggest that Rashba interaction, often\nconsidered as an unwanted disorder effect, may be exploited to tailor the shape\nand the propagation time of photoexcited spin-polarised wave packets.\n", "  Using Dirac's method for the quantization of constrained systems QED is\ncanonically quantized in the front-form in a gauge which is the light-front\nanalog of the Weyl gauge. From the obtained vacuum wave functional the spatial\nWilson loop is calculated. The result known from the canonical instant-form\nquantization or from the covariant path integral quantization is found only if\nthe static limit $x^+ \\to 0$ is taken in a specific order. The same ambiguity\nis also found in the static photon propagator in coordinate space.\n", "  We study by first principle computer simulations the low temperature phase\ndiagram of bosonic dipolar gases in a bilayer geometry, as a function of the\ntwo control parameters, i.e., the in-plane density and the interlayer distance.\nWe observe four distinct phases, namely paired and decoupled superfluids, as\nwell as a crystal of dimers and one consisting of two aligned crystalline\nlayers. A direct quantum phase transition from a dimer crystal to two\nindependent superfluids is observed in a relatively wide range of parameters.\nNo supersolid phase is predicted for this system.\n", "  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been conventionally bifurcated into two distinct\ncategories dubbed \"short\" and \"long\", depending on whether their durations are\nless than or greater than two seconds respectively. However, many authors have\npointed to the existence of a third class of GRBs with mean durations\nintermediate between the short and long GRBs. Here, we apply multiple model\ncomparison techniques to verify these claims. For each category, we obtain the\nbest-fit parameters by maximizing a likelihood function based on a weighted\nsuperposition of lognormal distributions. We then do model-comparison between\neach of these hypotheses by comparing the chi-square probabilities, Akaike\nInformation criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information criterion (BIC). We\nuniformly apply these techniques to GRBs from Swift (both observer and\nintrinsic frame), BATSE, BeppoSAX, and Fermi-GBM. We find that the Swift GRB\ndistributions (in the observer frame) show evidence for three categories at\nabout $2.4\\sigma$ from difference in chi-squares and show decisive evidence in\nfavor of the two components using both AIC and BIC. For all the other datasets,\nevidence for three components is either very marginal or not favored.\n", "  Simulation of the so-called monatomic and diatomic chains by the computer\nprogram CHAINPLOT is described. The simulation provides useful teaching\nmaterial for undergraduate condensed matter physics lecture courses, and has\nrevealed that for the last 63 years a fundamental description of the actual\natomic motions has been copied in the literature, despite being incorrect or at\nleast misleading..\n", "  We study the time lags between the continuum emission of quasars at different\nwavelengths, based on more than four years of multi-band ($g$, $r$, $i$, $z$)\nlight-curves in the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Fields. As photons from different\nbands emerge from different radial ranges in the accretion disk, the lags\nconstrain the sizes of the accretion disks. We select 240 quasars with\nredshifts $z \\approx 1$ or $z \\approx 0.3$ that are relatively emission line\nfree. The light curves are sampled from day to month timescales, which makes it\npossible to detect lags on the scale of the light crossing time of the\naccretion disks. With the code JAVELIN, we detect typical lags of several days\nin the rest frame between the $g$ band and the $riz$ bands. The detected lags\nare $\\sim 2-3$ times larger than the light crossing time estimated from the\nstandard thin disk model, consistent with the recently measured lag in NGC5548\nand micro-lensing measurements of quasars. The lags in our sample are found to\nincrease with increasing luminosity. Furthermore, the increase in lags going\nfrom $g-r$ to $g-i$ and then to $g-z$ is slower than predicted in the thin disk\nmodel, particularly for high luminosity quasars. The radial temperature profile\nin the disk must be different from what is assumed. We also find evidence that\nthe lags decrease with increasing line ratios between ultraviolet FeII lines\nand MgII, which may point to changes in the accretion disk structure at higher\nmetallicity.\n", "  We demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that geometric frustration\nin two-dimensional periodic acoustic networks consisting of arrays of narrow\nair channels can be harnessed to form band gaps (ranges of frequency in which\nthe waves cannot propagate in any direction through the system). While resonant\nstanding wave modes and interferences are ubiquitous in all the analyzed\nnetwork geometries, we show that they give rise to band gaps only in the\ngeometrically frustrated ones (i.e. those comprising of triangles and\npentagons). Our results not only reveal a new mechanism based on geometric\nfrustration to suppress the propagation of pressure waves in specific frequency\nranges, but also opens avenues for the design of a new generation of smart\nsystems that control and manipulate sound and vibrations.\n", "  Modern experimental facilities, such as CBELSA, ELPH, JLab, MAMI and SPring-8\nhave provided a tremendous volume of data, often with wide energy and angular\ncoverage, and with increasing precision. For reactions with two hadrons in the\nfinal state, these data are often presented as multiple sets of panels, with\nangular distributions at numerous specific energies. Such presentations have\nlimited visual appeal, and their physical content is typically extracted\nthrough some model- dependent treatment. Instead, we explore the use of a\nLegendre series expansion with a relatively small number of essential\ncoefficients. This approach has been applied in several recent experimental\ninvestigations. We present some general properties of the Legendre coefficients\nin the helicity framework and consider what physical information can be\nextracted without any model-dependent assumptions.\n", "  Before the publication of the Gaia Catalogue, the contents of the first data\nrelease have undergone multiple dedicated validation tests. These tests aim at\nanalysing in-depth the Catalogue content to detect anomalies, individual\nproblems in specific objects or in overall statistical properties, either to\nfilter them before the public release, or to describe the different caveats of\nthe release for an optimal exploitation of the data. Dedicated methods using\neither Gaia internal data, external catalogues or models have been developed\nfor the validation processes. They are testing normal stars as well as various\npopulations like open or globular clusters, double stars, variable stars,\nquasars. Properties of coverage, accuracy and precision of the data are\nprovided by the numerous tests presented here and jointly analysed to assess\nthe data release content. This independent validation confirms the quality of\nthe published data, Gaia DR1 being the most precise all-sky astrometric and\nphotometric catalogue to-date. However, several limitations in terms of\ncompleteness, astrometric and photometric quality are identified and described.\nFigures describing the relevant properties of the release are shown and the\ntesting activities carried out validating the user interfaces are also\ndescribed. A particular emphasis is made on the statistical use of the data in\nscientific exploitation.\n", "  The coefficient of the dimensionally regularized two-loop R^3 divergence of\n(nonsupersymmetric) gravity theories has recently been shown to change when\nnon-dynamical three forms are added to the theory, or when a pseudo-scalar is\nreplaced by the anti-symmetric two-form field to which it is dual. This\nphenomenon involves evanescent operators, whose matrix elements vanish in four\ndimensions, including the Gauss-Bonnet operator which is also connected to the\ntrace anomaly. On the other hand, these effects appear to have no physical\nconsequences in renormalized scattering processes. In particular, the\ndependence of the two-loop four-graviton scattering amplitude on the\nrenormalization scale is simple. In this paper, we explain this result for any\nminimally-coupled massless gravity theory with renormalizable matter\ninteractions by using unitarity cuts in four dimensions and never invoking\nevanescent operators.\n", "  We compute the polylogarithmic parts of the two-loop four and five-graviton\namplitudes where the external helicities are positive and express these in a\nsimple compact analytic form. We use these to extract the $\\ln(\\mu^2)$ terms\nfrom both the four and five-point amplitudes and show that these match the same\n  $R^3$ counterterm.\n", "  It is shown that the single-particle spin-orbit coupling terms, which---in\nthe cold atom context---are associated with synthetic gauge fields, can\nsignificantly and non-trivially modify the phase accumulation at small\ninterparticle distances even if the length scale $(k_{\\text{so}})^{-1}$\nassociated with the spin-orbit coupling term is significantly larger than the\nvan der Waals length $r_{\\text{vdW}}$ that characterizes the two-body\ninteraction potential. A theoretical framework, which utilizes a generalized\nlocal frame transformation and accounts for the phase accumulation\nanalytically, is developed. Comparison with numerical coupled-channels\ncalculations demonstrates that the phase accumulation can, to a very good\napproximation, be described over a wide range of energies by the free-space\nscattering phase shifts---evaluated at a scattering energy that depends on\n$k_{\\text{so}}$---and the spin-orbit coupling strength $k_{\\text{so}}$.\n", "  In the Standard Model of electroweak interactions and in the\ntree--approximation we calculate the rate and branching ratio of the neutron\nradiative beta decay with one-real photon emission by taking into account the\ncontributions of the weak magnetism and proton recoil to order 1/m_p of the\nlarge proton mass m_p expansion. We find that the obtained contributions of the\nweak magnetism and proton recoil increase the rate and branching ratio of the\nneutron radiative beta decay by about 0.70%. This is large compared with the\ncontribution of the weak magnetism and proton recoil of about 0.16% to the rate\nof the neutron beta decay, calculated in Phys. Rev. D88, 073002 (2013).\n", "  We investigate the excitation dynamics at a first-order quantum phase\ntransition (QPT). More specifically, we consider the quench-induced QPT in the\nquantum search algorithm, which aims at finding out a marked element in an\nunstructured list. We begin by deriving the exact dynamics of the model, which\nis shown to obey a Riccati differential equation. Then, we discuss the\nprobabilities of success by adopting either global or local adiabaticity\nstrategies. Moreover, we determine the disturbance of the quantum criticality\nas a function of the system size. In particular, we show that the critical\npoint exponentially converges to its thermodynamic limit even in a fast\nevolution regime, which is characterized by both entanglement QPT estimators\nand the Schmidt gap. The excitation pattern is manifested in terms of quantum\ndomains walls separated by kinks. The kink density is then shown to follow an\nexponential scaling as a function of the evolution speed, which can be\ninterpreted as a Kibble-Zurek mechanism for first-order QPTs.\n", "  We make a detailed comparison between two attempts in recent years to\nconstruct hydrodynamic effective actions: we compare our work [1-7] with that\nof Crossley-Glorioso-Liu [8] and Glorioso-Liu [9]. The general philosophy\nespoused by the two approaches has a degree of overlap, despite various\ndifferences. We will try to outline the similarities to eke out the general\nlessons that have been uncovered, hoping that it will ease the access to the\nsubject for interested readers.\n", "  These notes were prepared for the introductory lectures on Higher Spin\nHolography presented at the Twelfth Modave Summer School in Mathematical\nPhysics 2016, aimed at Ph.D. students and researchers new to this topic.\nContents:\n  1.

The mechanisms reported so far are local\nexcitability and excitation of a localized structure. Here we introduce an\nalternative mechanism based on the coexistence of two homogeneous stable states\nand spatial coupling. We show the existence of a threshold for perturbations of\nthe homogeneous state. Sub-threshold perturbations decay exponentially.\nSuper-threshold perturbations induce the emergence of a long-lived structure\nformed by two back to back fronts that join the two homogeneous states. While\nin typical excitability the trajectory follows the remnants of a limit cycle,\nhere reinjection is provided by front interaction, such that fronts slowly\napproach each other until eventually annihilating. This front-mediated\nmechanism shows that extended systems with no oscillatory regimes can display\nexcitability.\n", "  We investigate the high-pressure behaviour of beryllium, magnesium and\ncalcium difluorides using ab initio random structure searching and density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations, over the pressure range 0-70 GPa.\nBeryllium fluoride exhibits extensive polymorphism at low pressures, and we\nfind two new phases for this compound - the silica moganite and CaCl2\nstructures - which are stable over the wide pressure range 12-57 GPa. For\nmagnesium fluoride, our searching results show that the orthorhombic `O-I' TiO2\nstructure (Pbca, Z=8) is stable for this compound between 40 and 44 GPa. Our\nsearches find no new phases at the static-lattice level for calcium difluoride\nbetween 0 and 70 GPa; however, a phase with P62m symmetry is close to stability\nover this pressure range, and our calculations predict that this phase is\nstabilised at high temperature. The P62m structure exhibits an unstable phonon\nmode at large volumes which may signal a transition to a superionic state at\nhigh temperatures. The Group-II difluorides are isoelectronic to a number of\nother AB2-type compounds such as SiO2 and TiO2, and we discuss our results in\nlight of these similarities.\n", "  Nuclear forces and hyperon forces are studied by lattice QCD. Simulations are\nperformed with (almost) physical quark masses, $m_\\pi \\simeq 146$ MeV and $m_K\n\\simeq 525$ MeV, where $N_f=2+1$ nonperturbatively ${\\cal O}(a)$-improved\nWilson quark action with stout smearing and Iwasaki gauge action are employed\non the lattice of $(96a)^4 \\simeq (8.1\\mbox{fm})^4$ with $a^{-1} \\simeq 2.3$\nGeV. In this report, we give the overview of the theoretical framework and\npresent the numerical results for two-nucleon forces ($S=0$) and two-$\\Xi$\nforces ($S=-4$). Central forces are studied in $^1S_0$ channel, and central and\ntensor forces are obtained in $^3S_1$-$^3D_1$ coupled channel analysis.\n", "  For quite some time non-monotonic flow curve was thought to be a requirement\nfor shear banded flows in complex fluids. Thus, in simple yield stress fluids\nshear banding was considered to be absent. Recent spatially resolved\nrheological experiments have found simple yield stress fluids to exhibit shear\nbanded flow profiles. One proposed mechanism for the initiation of such\ntransient shear banding process has been a small stress heterogeneity rising\nfrom the experimental device geometry. Here, using Computational Fluid Dynamics\nmethods, we show that transient shear banding can be initialized even under\nhomogeneous stress conditions by the fluid start-up inertia, and that such\nmechanism indeed is present in realistic experimental conditions.\n", "  Near-solar metallicity (and low-redshift) Pair-Instability Supernova (PISN)\ncandidates challenge stellar evolution models. Indeed, at such a metallicity,\neven an initially very massive star generally loses so much mass by stellar\nwinds that it will avoid the electron-positron pair-creation instability. We\nuse recent results showing that a magnetic field at the surface of a massive\nstar can significantly reduce its effective mass-loss rate to compute magnetic\nmodels of very massive stars (VMSs) at solar metallicity and explore the\npossibility that such stars end as PISNe. We implement the quenching of the\nmass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar\nevolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of\n$200\\,M_\\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably\nreduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life. For the\nnon-rotating model, the total (CO-core) mass of the models is $72.8\\,M_\\odot$\n($70.1\\,M_\\odot$) at the onset of the electron-positron pair-creation\ninstability. For the rotating model, we obtain $65.6\\,M_\\odot$\n($62.4\\,M\\odot$). In both cases, a significant fraction of the internal mass\nlies in the region where pair instability occurs in the $\\log(T)-\\log(\\rho)$\nplane. The interaction of the reduced mass loss with the magnetic field\nefficiently brakes the surface of the rotating model, producing a strong shear\nand hence a very efficient mixing that makes the star evolve nearly\nhomogeneously. The core characteristics of our models indicate that solar\nmetallicity models of magnetic VMSs may evolve to PISNe (and pulsation PISNe).\n", "  In this paper, the mass spectra are obtained for doubly heavy $\\Xi$ baryons,\nnamely, $\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, $\\Xi_{bb}^{-}$, $\\Xi_{bb}^{0}$,\n$\\Xi_{bc}^{0}$ and $\\Xi_{bc}^{+}$. These baryons are consist of two heavy\nquarks($cc$, $bb$ and $bc$) with a light($d$ or $u$) quark. The ground, radial\nand orbital states are calculated in framework of Hypercentral constituent\nquark model with coul- omb plus linear potential. Our outcomes are also\ncompared with other predictions, thus, the average possible range of excited\nstates masses of these $\\Xi$ baryons can be determined. The study of the Regge\ntrajectories are performed in (n, $M^{2}$) and (J, $M^{2}$) planes and their\nslopes and intercepts are also determined. Lastly, the ground state magnetic\nmoments of these doubly heavy baryons are also calculated.\n", "  We have detected four flares from UV Ceti at 154 MHz using the Murchison\nWidefield Array. The flares have flux densities between 10--65 mJy --- a factor\nof 100 fainter than most flares in the literature at these frequencies --- and\nare only detected in polarization. The circular polarized fractions are limited\nto $>27$% at 3$\\sigma$ confidence and two of the flares exhibit polarity\nreversal. We suggest that these flares occur periodically on a time scale\nconsistent with the rotational period of UV Ceti. During the brightest observed\nflare, we also detect significant linear polarization with polarization\nfraction $>18$%. Averaging the data in 6-minute, 10 MHz frequency bins we find\nthat the flux density of these flares does not vary over the 30 MHz bandwidth\nof the Murchison Widefield Array, however we cannot rule out finer\ntime-frequency structure. Using the measured flux densities for the flares, we\nestimate brightness temperatures between $(10^{13}-10^{14})\\,$K, indicative of\na coherent emission mechanism. The brightness temperature and polarization\ncharacteristics point to the electron cyclotron maser mechanism. We also\ncalculate the flare rates given our four observed flares and compare them to\nflare rates for the set of M dwarf stars with known 100--200 MHz flares. Our\nmeasurement is the first for flares with intensities $<100$ mJy at 100-200 MHz.\n", "  An obvious criterion to classify theories of modified gravity is to identify\ntheir gravitational degrees of freedom and their coupling to the metric and the\nmatter sector. Using this simple idea, we show that any theory which depends on\nthe curvature invariants is equivalent to general relativity in the presence of\nnew fields that are gravitationally coupled to the energy-momentum tensor. We\nshow that they can be shifted into a new energy-momentum tensor. There is no a\npriori reason to identify these new fields as gravitational degrees of freedom\nor matter fields. This leads to an equivalence between dark matter particles\ngravitationally coupled to the standard model fields and modified gravity\ntheories designed to account for the dark matter phenomenon. Due to this\nambiguity, it is impossible to differentiate experimentally between these\ntheories and any attempt of doing so should be classified as a mere\ninterpretation of the same phenomenon.\n", "  Seasonal patterns associated with stress modulation, as evidenced by\nearthquake occurrence, have been detected in regions characterized by present\nday mountain building and glacial retreat in the Northern Hemisphere. In the\nHimalaya and the Alps, seismicity is peaking in spring and summer; opposite\nbehaviour is observed in the Apennines. This diametrical behaviour, confirmed\nby recent strong earthquakes, well correlates with the dominant tectonic\nregime: peak in spring and summer in shortening areas, peak in fall and winter\nin extensional areas. The analysis of the seasonal effect is extended to\nseveral shortening (e.g. Zagros and Caucasus) and extensional regions, and\ncounter-examples from regions where no seasonal modulation is expected (e.g.\nTropical Atlantic Ridge). This study generalizes to different seismotectonic\nsettings the early observations made about short-term (seasonal) and long-term\n(secular) modulation of seismicity and confirms, with some statistical\nsignificance, that snow and ice thaw may cause crustal deformations that\nmodulate the occurrence of major earthquakes.\n", "  As an application of the Covariant Spectator Theory (CST) we calculate the\nspectrum of heavy-light and heavy-heavy mesons using covariant versions of a\nlinear confining potential, a one- gluon exchange, and a constant interaction.\nThe CST equations possess the correct one-body limit and are therefore\nwell-suited to describe mesons in which one quark is much heavier than the\nother. We find a good fit to the mass spectrum of heavy-light and heavy-heavy\nmesons with just three parameters (apart from the quark masses). Remarkably,\nthe fit parameters are nearly unchanged when we fit to experimental\npseudoscalar states only or to the whole spectrum. Because pseudoscalar states\nare insensitive to spin-orbit interactions and do not determine spin-spin\ninteractions separately from central interactions, this result suggests that it\nis the covariance of the kernel that correctly predicts the spin-dependent\nquark-antiquark interactions\n", "  We study the spatial statistics of velocity gradient volatility (i,e., the\nenergy dissipation rate) in turbulent flow. We extend the Kolmogorov-Obukhov\ntheory but also narrow its scope. The models are log normal, with verification\nfrom finely resolved large eddy and direct numerical simulations. They are\nparameterized by a mean and a covariance operator. Addressing applications to\nlarge eddy simulations, the mean and the covariance depend on the resolved\nscale solution. Removing this resolved scale dependence by a locally defined\nrescaling of the turbulent statistics yields a universal theory for the subgrid\nstatistics, specifically for the mean and variance of turbulent fluctuations,\ni.e., the log of the energy dissipation rate {\\epsilon}. The variance of the\nvelocity gradient statistics is found to be log normal, in accordance with\nKolmogorov 1962. Rescaling by the resolved scale mean and variance removes the\ninfluence of the resolved scales on the subgrid scales, justifying conceptually\nthe universality we observe. The universality is the basis of new power scaling\nlaws. The new power laws, in turn, allow a simple parameterization of the mean\nand covariance of the subgrid rescaled dissipation rate, i.e., velocity\ngradient volatility. We treat the coarse grid resolved space- time location as\na random variable. A restriction of the theory to a small range of unresolved\nbut stochastically modelled scales is proposed, with renormalization group\nideas offered to overcome this restriction.\n", "  We establish a functional weak law of large numbers for observable\nmacroscopic state variables of interacting particle systems (e.g., voter and\ncontact processes) over fast time-varying sparse random networks of\ninteractions. We show that, as the number of agents $N$ grows large, the\nproportion of agents $\\left(\\overline{Y}_{k}^{N}(t)\\right)$ at a certain state\n$k$ converges in distribution -- or, more precisely, weakly with respect to the\nuniform topology on the space of \\emph{c\\`adl\\`ag} sample paths -- to the\nsolution of an ordinary differential equation over any compact interval\n$\\left[0,T\\right]$. Although the limiting process is Markov, the prelimit\nprocesses, i.e., the normalized macrostate vector processes\n$\\left(\\mathbf{\\overline{Y}}^{N}(t)\\right)=\\left(\\overline{Y}_{1}^{N}(t),\\ldots,\\overline{Y}_{K}^{N}(t)\\right)$,\nare non-Markov as they are tied to the \\emph{high-dimensional} microscopic\nstate of the system, which precludes the direct application of standard\narguments for establishing weak convergence. The techniques developed in the\npaper for establishing weak convergence might be of independent interest.\n", "  Cosmic strings are topological defects possibly formed in the early Universe,\nwhich may be observable due to their gravitational effects on the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation or gravitational wave experiments. To this\neffect it is important to quantitatively ascertain the network properties,\nincluding their density, velocity or the number of strings present, at the\nvarious epochs in the observable Universe. Attempts to estimate these numbers\noften rely on simplistic approximations for the string parameters, such as\nassuming that the network is scaling. However, in cosmological models\ncontaining realistic amounts of radiation, matter and dark energy a string\nnetwork is never exactly scaling. Here we use the velocity-dependent one-scale\nmodel for the evolution of a string network to better quantify how these\nnetworks evolve. In particular we obtain new approximate analytic solutions for\nthe behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and\nmatter-to-acceleration transitions (assuming, in the latter case, the canonical\n$\\Lambda$ cold dark matter model), and numerically calculate the relevant\nquantities for a range of possible dark energy models.\n", "  We study the lower deviation probability of the position of the rightmost\nparticle in a branching Brownian motion and obtain its large deviation function\n", "  Given constant data of density $\\rho_0$, velocity $-u_0{\\bf e}_r$, pressure\n$p_0$ and electric force $-E_0{\\bf e}_r$ for supersonic flow at the entrance,\nand constant pressure $p_{\\rm ex}$ for subsonic flow at the exit, we prove that\nEuler-Poisson system admits a unique transonic shock solution in a two\ndimensional convergent nozzle, provided that $u_0>0$, $E_0>0$, and that $E_0$\nis sufficiently large depending on $(\\rho_0, u_0, p_0)$ and the length of the\nnozzle.\n", "  The quantum weak value draws many attentions recently from theoretical\ncuriosity to experimental applications. Now we design an unusual weak measuring\nprocedure as the pre-selection, mid-selection and post-selection to study the\ncorrelation function of two weak values, which we called the weak correlation\nfunction. In this paper, we proposed an weak measurement experiment to measure\nthe canonical commutator $[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i\\hbar$ in quantum mechanics.\nFurthurmore, we found the intriguing equivalence between the canonical\ncommutation relation and Riemann hypothesis, and then obtained the weak value\nof nontrivial Riemann zeros. Finally, as an nontrivial example of weak\ncorrelations, we also passed successfully a testing on the (anti-)commutators\nof Pauli operators, which followed the experimental setup of the landmark paper\nof Aharonov, et al. in 1988. Our proposed experiments could hopefully test the\nfundamental canonical relationship in quantum worlds and trigger more testing\nexperiments on weak correlations.\n", "  A number of recent estimates of the total luminosities of galaxies in the\nSDSS are significantly larger than those reported by the SDSS pipeline. This is\nbecause of a combination of three effects: one is simply a matter of defining\nthe scale out to which one integrates the fit when defining the total\nluminosity, and amounts on average to < 0.1 mags even for the most luminous\ngalaxies. The other two are less trivial and tend to be larger; they are due to\ndifferences in how the background sky is estimated and what model is fit to the\nsurface brightness profile. We show that PyMorph sky estimates are fainter than\nthose of the SDSS DR7 or DR9 pipelines, but are in excellent agreement with the\nestimates of Blanton et al. (2011). Using the SDSS sky biases luminosities by\nmore than a few tenths of a magnitude for objects with half-light radii > 7\narcseconds. In the SDSS main galaxy sample these are typically luminous\ngalaxies, so they are not necessarily nearby. This bias becomes worse when\nallowing the model more freedom to fit the surface brightness profile. When\nPyMorph sky values are used, then two component Sersic-Exponential fits to\nE+S0s return more light than single component deVaucouleurs fits (up to ~0.2\nmag), but less light than single Sersic fits (0.1 mag). Finally, we show that\nPyMorph fits of Meert et al. (2015) to DR7 data remain valid for DR9 images.\nOur findings show that, especially at large luminosities, these PyMorph\nestimates should be preferred to the SDSS pipeline values.\n", "  We propose a 2D generalization to the $M$-band case of the dual-tree\ndecomposition structure (initially proposed by N. Kingsbury and further\ninvestigated by I. Selesnick) based on a Hilbert pair of wavelets. We\nparticularly address (\\textit{i}) the construction of the dual basis and\n(\\textit{ii}) the resulting directional analysis. We also revisit the necessary\npre-processing stage in the $M$-band case. While several reconstructions are\npossible because of the redundancy of the representation, we propose a new\noptimal signal reconstruction technique, which minimizes potential estimation\nerrors. The effectiveness of the proposed $M$-band decomposition is\ndemonstrated via denoising comparisons on several image types (natural,\ntexture, seismics), with various $M$-band wavelets and thresholding strategies.\nSignificant improvements in terms of both overall noise reduction and direction\npreservation are observed.\n", "  High-resolution non-invasive 3D study of intact spine and spinal cord\nmorphology on the level of complex vascular and neuronal organization is a\ncrucial issue for the development of treatments for the injuries and\npathologies of central nervous system (CNS). X-ray phase contrast tomography\nenables high quality 3D visualization in ex-vivo mouse model of both vascular\nand neuronal network of the soft spinal cord tissue at the scale from\nmillimeters to hundreds of nanometers without any contrast agents and\nsectioning. Until now, 3D high resolution visualization of spinal cord mostly\nhas been limited by imaging of organ extracted from vertebral column because\nhigh absorbing boney tissue drastically reduces the morphological details of\nsoft tissue in image. However, the extremely destructive procedure of bones\nremoval leads to sample deterioration and, therefore, to the lack of\nconsiderable part of information about the object. In this work we present the\ndata analysis procedure to get high resolution and high contrast 3D images of\nintact mice spinal cord surrounded by vertebras, preserving all richness of\nmicro-details of the spinal cord inhabiting inside. Our results are the first\nstep forward to the difficult way toward the high- resolution investigation of\nin-vivo model central nervous system.\n", "  We report a theoretical analysis showing that Rayleigh scattering could be\nused to monitor the growth of nanoparticles under arc discharge conditions. We\ncompute the Rayleigh scattering cross sections of the nanoparticles by\ncombining light scattering theory for gas-particle mixtures with calculations\nof the dynamic electronic polarizability of the nanoparticles. We find that the\nresolution of the Rayleigh scattering probe is adequate to detect nanoparticles\nas small as C60 at the expected concentrations of synthesis conditions in the\narc periphery. Larger asymmetric nanoparticles would yield brighter signals,\nmaking possible to follow the evolution of the growing nanoparticle population\nfrom the evolution of the scattered intensity. Observable spectral features\ninclude characteristic resonant behaviour, shape-dependent depolarization\nratio, and mass-dependent line shape. Direct observation of nanoparticles in\nthe early stages of growth with unobtrusive laser probes should give insight on\nthe particle formation mechanisms and may lead to better-controlled synthesis\nprotocols.\n", "  We present observations of the ground state 1$_{0,1}$-0$_{0,0}$ rotational\ntransition of HDO at 464.925 GHz and the 1$_{1,0}$-1$_{0,1}$ transition at\n509.292 GHz toward the three high-mass star forming regions: G34.26+0.15, W49N,\nand W51e$_{1}$/e$_{2}$, carried out with the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory.\nThe latter transition is observed for the first time from the ground. The\nspectra are modeled, together with observations of higher-energy HDO\ntransitions, as well as submillimeter dust continuum fluxes from the\nliterature, using a spherically symmetric radiative transfer model to derive\nthe radial distribution of the HDO abundance in the target sources. The\nabundance profile is divided into an inner hot core region, with kinetic\ntemperatures higher than 100~K, and a cold outer envelope with lower kinetic\ntemperatures. The derived HDO abundance with respect to H$_2$ is\n(0.3-3.7)$\\times 10^{-8}$ in the hot inner region ($T > 100 \\mathrm{K}$) and\n(7.0-10.0)$\\times 10^{-11}$ in the cold outer envelope. We also used two\nH$_{2}^{18}$O fundamental transitions to constrain the H$_{2}$O abundances in\nthe outer envelopes. The HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios in these cold regions are found to\nbe (1.8-3.1)$\\times 10^{-3}$ and are consequently higher than in the hot inner\nregions of these sources.\n", "  The ability to apply GHz frequencies to control the quantum state of a single\n$P$ atom is an essential requirement for the fast gate pulsing needed for qubit\ncontrol in donor based silicon quantum computation. Here we demonstrate this\nwith nanosecond accuracy in an all epitaxial single atom transistor by applying\nexcitation signals at frequencies up to $\\approx$ 13 GHz to heavily phosphorous\ndoped silicon leads. These measurements allow the differentiation between the\nexcited states of the single atom and the density of states in the one\ndimensional leads. Our pulse spectroscopy experiments confirm the presence of\nan excited state at an energy $\\approx$ 9 meV consistent with the first excited\nstate of a single $P$ donor in silicon. The relaxation rate of this first\nexcited state to ground is estimated to be larger than 2.5 GHz, consistent with\ntheoretical predictions. These results represent a systematic investigation of\nhow an atomically precise single atom transistor device behaves under rf\nexcitations.\n", "  Verlinde argued \\cite{Verlinde:2016toy} that baryonic matter in de Sitter\nUniverse with a Hubble constant $H$ produces a bulk contribution to the vacuum\nentanglement entropy $\\delta S_{ent}$. Using the de Sitter temperature\n$T_{dS}=\\frac{H}{2\\pi}$, he interpreted $\\delta M$ in the first law $T_{dS}\\\n\\delta S_{ent}=-\\delta M$ with the Dark Matter energy. We use standard tools of\nthe gauge/gravity correspondence to present some evidence for the Verlinde's\nproposal.\n", "  The Fermi LAT has opened the way for comparative studies of cosmic rays (CRs)\nand high-energy objects in the Milky Way (MW) and in other, external,\nstar-forming galaxies. Using 2 yr of observations with the Fermi LAT, local\nGroup galaxy M31 was detected as a marginally extended gamma-ray source, while\nonly an upper limit (UL) has been derived for the other nearby galaxy M33. We\nrevisited the gamma-ray emission in the direction of M31 and M33 using more\nthan 7 yr of LAT Pass 8 data in the energy range 0.1-100 GeV, presenting\ndetailed morphological and spectral analyses. M33 remains undetected and we\ncomputed an UL for it. This revised UL remains consistent with the observed\ncorrelation between gamma-ray luminosity and star-formation rate tracers and\nimplies an average CR density in M33 that is at most half of that of the MW.\nM31 is detected with a significance of nearly 10 sigma and to be extended with\n4 sigma. Its spectrum is consistent with a power law. The spatial distribution\nof the emission is consistent with a uniform disk with a radius of 0.4 deg and\nno offset from the center of M31, but nonuniform intensity distributions cannot\nbe excluded. The flux from M31 appears confined to the inner regions of the\ngalaxy and does not fill the disk or extend far from it. The gamma-ray signal\nis not correlated with regions rich in gas or star-formation activity\nsuggesting that the emission is not interstellar in origin, unless the\nenergetic particles radiating in gamma rays do not originate in recent star\nformation. Alternative and nonexclusive interpretations are that the emission\nresults from a population of millisecond pulsars dispersed in the bulge and\ndisk of M31 by disrupted globular clusters or from the decay or annihilation of\ndark matter particles, similar to what has been proposed to account for the\nso-called Galactic Center excess found in Fermi-LAT observations of the MW.\n", "  The classical habitable zone is the circular region around a star in which\nliquid water could exist on the surface of a rocky planet. The outer edge of\nthe traditional N2-CO2-H2O habitable zone (HZ) extends out to nearly 1.7 AU in\nour Solar System, beyond which condensation and scattering by CO2 outstrips its\ngreenhouse capacity. Here, we show that volcanic outgassing of atmospheric H2\non a planet near the outer edge can extend the habitable zone out to ~2.4 AU in\nour solar system. This wider volcanic hydrogen habitable zone (N2-CO2-H2O-H2)\ncan be sustained as long as volcanic H2 output offsets its escape from the top\nof the atmosphere. We use a single-column radiative-convective climate model to\ncompute the HZ limits of this volcanic hydrogen habitable zone for hydrogen\nconcentrations between 1% and 50%, assuming diffusion-limited atmospheric\nescape. At a hydrogen concentration of 50%, the effective stellar flux required\nto support the outer edge decreases by ~35% to 60% for M to A stars. The\ncorresponding orbital distances increase by ~30% to 60%. The inner edge of this\nHZ only moves out by ~0.1 to 4% relative to the classical HZ because H2 warming\nis reduced in dense H2O atmospheres. The atmospheric scale heights of such\nvolcanic H2 atmospheres near the outer edge of the HZ also increase,\nfacilitating remote detection of atmospheric signatures.\n", "  It has been found that contrarian oscillators usually take a negative role in\nthe collective behaviors formed by conformist oscillators. However, experiments\nrevealed that it is also possible to achieve a strong coherence even when there\nare contrarians in the system such as neuron networks with both excitable and\ninhibitory neurons. To understand the underlying mechanism of this abnormal\nphenomenon, we here consider a complex network of coupled Kuramoto oscillators\nwith mixed positive and negative couplings and present an efficient approach,\ni.e. tit-for-tat strategy, to suppress the negative role of contrarian\noscillators in synchronization and thus increase the order parameter of\nsynchronization. Two classes of contrarian oscillators are numerically studied\nand a brief theoretical analysis is provided to explain the numerical results.\n", "  In this work, we study the dynamical robustness in a system consisting of\nboth active and inactive oscillators. We analytically show that the dynamical\nrobustness of such system is determined by the cross link density between\nactive and inactive subpopulations, which depends on the specific process of\ninactivation. It is the multi-valued dependence of the cross link density on\nthe control parameter, i.e., the ratio of inactive oscillators in the system,\nthat leads to the fluctuation of the critical points. We further investigate\nhow different network topologies and inactivation strategies affect the\nfluctuation. Our results explain why the fluctuation is more obvious in\nheterogeneous networks than in homogeneous ones, and why the low-degree nodes\nare crucial in terms of dynamical robustness. The analytical results are\nsupported by numerical verifications.\n", "  Synchronization in a frequency-weighted Kuramoto model with a uniform\nfrequency distribution is studied. We plot the bifurcation diagram and identify\nthe asymptotic coherent states. Numerical simulations show that the system\nundergoes two first-order transitions in both the forward and backward\ndirections. Apart from the trivial phase-locked state, a novel nonstationary\ncoherent state, i.e., a nontrivial standing wave state is observed and\ncharacterized. In this state, oscillators inside the coherent clusters are not\nfrequency-locked as they would be in the usual standing wave state. Instead,\ntheir average frequencies are locked to a constant. The critical coupling\nstrength from the incoherent state to the nontrivial standing wave state can be\nobtained by performing linear stability analysis. The theoretical results are\nsupported by the numerical simulations.\n", "  The feature-rich electronic and magnetic properties of fluorine-doped\ngraphene nanoribbons are investigated by the first-principles calculations.\nThey arise from the cooperative or competitive relations among the significant\nchemical bonds, finite-size quantum confinement and edge structure. There exist\nC-C, C-F, and F-F bonds with the multi-orbital hybridizations. Fluorine adatoms\ncan create the p-type metals or the concentration- and distribution-dependent\nsemiconductors, depending on whether the $\\pi$ bonding is seriously suppressed\nby the top-site chemical bonding. Furthermore, five kinds of spin-dependent\nelectronic and magnetic properties cover the non-magnetic and ferromagnetic\nmetals, the non-magnetic semiconductors, and the anti-ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors with/without the spin splitting. The diverse essential\nproperties are clearly revealed in the spatial charge distribution, the spin\ndensity, and the orbital-projected density of states.\n", "  We determine the stability and instability of a sufficiently small and\nperiodic traveling wave to long wavelength perturbations, for a nonlinear\ndispersive equation which extends a Camassa-Holm equation to include all the\ndispersion of water waves and the Whitham equation to include nonlinearities of\nmedium amplitude waves. In the absence of the effects of surface tension, the\nresult qualitatively agrees with the Benjamin-Feir instability of a Stokes\nwave. In the presence of the effects of surface tension, it qualitatively\nagrees with those from formal asymptotic expansions of the physical problem and\nit improves upon that for the Whitham equation, correctly predicting the limit\nof strong surface tension. We discuss the modulational stability and\ninstability in the Camassa-Holm equation and related models.\n", "  A critical analysis of the feasibility of reversible computing is performed.\nThe key question is: Is it possible to build a completely reversible computer?\nA closer look into the internal aspects of the reversible computing as well as\nthe external constraints such as the second law of thermodynamics has\ndemonstrated that several difficulties would have to be solved before\nreversible computer is being built. It is shown that a conventional reversible\ncomputer would require energy for setting up the reversible inputs from\nirreversible signals, for the reading out of the reversible outputs, for the\ntransport of the information between logic elements and finally for the control\nsignals that will require more energy dissipating into the environment. A loose\nbound on the minimum amount of energy required to be dissipated during the\nphysical implementation of a reversible computer is obtained and a\ngeneralization of the principles for reversible computing is provided.\n", "  Guided wave modes in a symmetric slab waveguide formed by an isotropic\ndielectric layer with cubic nonlinear response placed in the hyperbolic\nsurrounding medium are investigated theoretically. Optical axis of the\nhyperbolic medium is normal to the slab plane. If dielectric permittivity of\nthe waveguide core is more than extraordinary permittivity of the hyperbolic\nmedium each TM mode has two cut-off frequencies. The dispersion relations for\nthese modes are found and numerically solved for cases of focusing and\ndefocussing medium of the core. Number of possible modes at given frequency\ndepends on the applied field intensity. It is shown that zero values of the TM\nmodes propagation constants are possible in the waveguide. Moreover in the\nself-defocussing case they can be obtained by increasing field intensity. The\ndependence of a propagation constant and width of the mode on radiation\nintensity is obtained and analyzed.\n", "  Differential cross-section measurements of highly boosted top quarks are\npresented. The dataset used has an integrated luminosity of $3.2$ fb$^{-1}$,\nrecorded at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS\ndetector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Events are selected in the\nlepton + jets channel, containing one isolated lepton and a large radius jet\nthat is identified as originating from a top quark using substructure tagging\ntechniques. The measured transverse momentum and absolute rapidity\ndistributions are unfolded to remove detector effects and compared to a range\nof Monte Carlo simulations. The transverse momentum distribution shows that all\nMonte Carlo generators used predict a harder spectrum than observed in data,\nwhile the rapidity distribution agrees well between MC and data.\n", "  Cosmic rays around the knee are generally believed to be of galactic origin.\nObservations on their energy spectrum and chemical composition are important\nfor understanding the acceleration and propagation of these cosmic rays. In\naddition, it is required to clarify the transition from galactic to\nextragalactic sources. In this paper, results of recent experiments measuring\naround the knee will be reviewed along with the detection techniques. The\nresults on the all-particle energy spectrum and composition in the energy range\nof the knee up to the ankle will be discussed.\n", "  Oscillations in a stochastic dynamical system, whose deterministic\ncounterpart has a stable steady state, are a widely reported phenomenon.\nTraditional methods of finding parameter regimes for stochastically-driven\nresonances are, however, cumbersome for any but the smallest networks. In this\nletter we show by example of the Brusselator how to use real root counting\nalgorithms and graph theoretic tools to efficiently determine the number of\nresonant modes and parameter ranges for stochastic oscillations. We argue that\nstochastic resonance is a network property by showing that resonant modes only\ndepend on the squared Jacobian matrix $J^2$ , unlike deterministic oscillations\nwhich are determined by $J$. By using graph theoretic tools, analysis of\nstochastic behaviour for larger networks is simplified and chemical reaction\nnetworks with multiple resonant modes can be identified easily.\n", "  The present short review article illustrates the latest theoretical\ndevelopments on quantum tomography, regarding general optimization methods for\nboth data-processing and setup. The basic theoretical tool is the\ninformationally complete measurement. The optimization theory for the setup is\nbased on the new theoretical approach of quantum combs.\n", "  Room temperature simulations of graphene have been performed as a function of\nthe mechanical tension of the layer. Finite-size effects are accurately\nreproduced by an acoustic dispersion law for the out-of-plane vibrations that,\nin the long-wave limit, behaves as $\\rho\\omega^2=\\sigma k^2+\\kappa k^4$. The\nfluctuation tension $\\sigma$ is finite ($\\sim 0.1$ N/m) even when the external\nmechanical tension vanishes. Transverse vibrations imply a duplicity in the\ndefinition of the elastic constants of the layer, as observables related to the\nreal area of the surface may differ from those related to the in-plane\nprojected area. This duplicity explains the variability of experimental data on\nthe Young modulus of graphene based on electron spectroscopy, interferometric\nprofilometery, and indentation experiments.\n", "  Single phase, sol-gel prepared Cu1-xFexO (0<x<0.125) are characterized in\nterms of structural, electronic and magnetic properties. Using dielectric and\nmagnetic studies we investigate the coupling of electron and spin. The\nelectrical conductivities and activation energies are studied with increasing\nFe content. Modeling of experimental conductivity data emphasizes on a single\nhopping mechanism for all samples except x=0.125, which have two activation\nenergies. Hole doping is confirmed from Hall effect [1] and by confirming a\nmajority Fe3+ substitution of Cu2+ in CuO from XPS studies. Such a substitution\nresults in stabilized ferromagnetism. Fe substitution introduces variation in\ncoercivity as an intrinsic magnetic property in Fe-doped CuO, and not as a\nsecondary impurity phase.\n", "  In this overview paper, we investigate the dispersion of electromagnetic\nwaves for dissipative and non-dissipative dielectric-magnetic uniaxial mediums.\nChanging the sign of one component of dielectric permittivity ({\\epsilon}) or\nmagnetic permeability ({\\mu}) from positive to negative will lead to sixteen\ndifferent cases (real or imaginary) for a non-dissipative medium and eight\ndifferent cases for dissipative one. In a non-dissipative medium, dispersion\nrelations follow the elliptic/hyperbolic relations. This rule completely\nvanishes regarding the dissipative medium. While the number of dispersion cases\nin a dissipative medium is lower than a non-dissipative one, there are cases\nwhich are not allowed in non-dissipative mediums but allowed in dissipative\nmediums.\n", "  Co-orbital planets have not yet been discovered, although they constitute a\nfrequent by-product of planetary formation and evolution models. This lack may\nbe due to observational biases, since the main detection methods are unable to\nspot co-orbital companions when they are small or near the Lagrangian\nequilibrium points. However, for a system with one known transiting planet\n(with mass $m_1$), we can detect a co-orbital companion (with mass $m_2$) by\ncombining the time of mid-transit with the radial-velocity data of the star.\nHere, we propose a simple method that allows the detection of co-orbital\ncompanions, valid for eccentric orbits, that relies on a single parameter\n$\\alpha$, which is proportional to the mass ratio $m_2/m_1$. Therefore, when\n$\\alpha$ is statistically different from zero, we have a strong candidate to\nharbour a co-orbital companion. We also discuss the relevance of false\npositives generated by different planetary configurations.\n", "  We report on finite-sized-induced transitions to synchrony in a population of\nphase oscillators coupled via a nonlinear mean field, which microscopically is\nequivalent to a hypernetwork organization of interactions. Using a\nself-consistent approach and direct numerical simulations, we argue that a\ntransition to synchrony occurs only for finite-size ensembles, and disappears\nin the thermodynamic limit. For all considered setups, that include purely\ndeterministic oscillators with or without heterogeneity in natural oscillatory\nfrequencies, and an ensemble of noise-driven identical oscillators, we\nestablish scaling relations describing the order parameter as a function of the\ncoupling constant and the system size.\n", "  For the IV-VI semiconductor family we derive an exact relation between the\nmicroscopic gap edge wave functions of the bulk insulator and the Dirac-Weyl\ntopological surface state wave function, thus obtaining a fully microscopic\nsurface state. We find that the balance of spin-orbit interaction and crystal\nfield in the bulk, and the band bending at the surface, can profoundly\ninfluence the surface state spin-momentum locking. As a manifestation of this\nwe predict that the spin texture of the $M$-point Dirac cones of SnTe can be\ntuned through an unexpectedly rich sequence of spin textures -- warped helical\nwith winding number $\\pm 1$, $k_x$ linear, hyperbolic, and $k_y$ linear -- e.g.\nby tuning the band bending at the surface.\n", "  We analyze quasiperiodic partially synchronous states in an ensemble of\nStuart-Landau oscillators with global nonlinear coupling. We reveal two types\nof such dynamics: in the first case the time-averaged frequencies of\noscillators and of the mean field differ, while in the second case they are\nequal, but the motion of oscillators is additionally modulated. We describe\ntransitions from the synchronous state to both types of quasiperiodic dynamics,\nand a transition between two different quasiperiodic states. We present an\nexample of a bifurcation diagram, where we show the borderlines for all these\ntransitions, as well as domain of bistability.\n", "  We conducted a large spectroscopic survey of 336 red giants in the direction\nof the Leo II dwarf galaxy using Hectochelle on the MMT, and conclude that 175\nof them are members based on their radial velocities and surface gravities. Of\nthis set, 40 stars have never before been spectroscopically observed. The\nsystemic velocity of the dwarf is 78.3+-0.6 km/s with a velocity dispersion of\n7.4+-0.4 km/s . We identify one star beyond the tidal radius of Leo II but find\nno signatures of uniform rotation, kinematic asymmetries, or streams. The stars\nshow a strong metallicity gradient of -1.53+-0.10 dex/kpc and have a mean\nmetallicity of -1.70+-0.02 dex. There is also evidence of two different\nchemodynamic populations, but the signal is weak. A larger sample of stars\nwould be necessary to verify this feature.\n", "  According to a well-known principle of thermodynamics, the transfer of heat\nbetween two bodies is reversible when their temperatures are infinitesimally\nclose. As we demonstrate, a little-known alternative exists: two bodies with\ntemperatures different by an arbitrary amount can completely exchange their\ntemperatures in a reversible way if split into infinitesimal parts that are\nbrought into thermal contact sequentially.\n", "  This paper studies the influence of electric fields on the skyrmion lattice\n(SkL) in insulating skyrmion compounds with weak magnetoelectric (ME) coupling.\nThe ME coupling mechanism is an interaction between the external electric field\n$E$ and local magnetization in the sample. Physically, the $E$-field perturbs\nthe spin modulation wave vectors resulting in the distortion of the SkL and the\n$E$-field induced shift in energy. Due to the relativistic smallness of ME\ncoupling, the important physics is captured already in the elastic\n($\\propto$$E$) and inelastic ($\\propto$$E^2$) responses. In this spirit, the\neffect of the fourth-order cubic anisotropy responsible for stabilization of\nthe skyrmion phase is taken into account perturbatively. The shift in energy\ncan be either positive or negative, -- depending on the direction of electric\nfield, -- thus stabilizing or destabilizing the SkL phase. Understanding the\n$E$-field energetics is important from the viewpoint of creation (writing) and\ndestruction (erasing) of skyrmion arrays over the bulk, which is paramount for\ndeveloping skyrmion-based logical elements and data storage.\n", "  This paper presents a system based on a Two-Way Particle-Tracking Model to\nanalyze possible crash positions of flight MH370. The particle simulator\nincludes a simple flow simulation of the debris based on a Lagrangian approach\nand a module to extract appropriated ocean current data from netCDF files. The\ninfluence of wind, waves, immersion depth and hydrodynamic behavior are not\nconsidered in the simulation.\n", "  We numerically investigate the effect of phase-amplitude coupling modulation\non power spectra in semiconductor lasers subject to optical injection in a face\nto face configuration, when a non-negligible injection delay time is taken into\naccount. We find that as phase-amplitude coupling factor alpha varies, the\nsystem goes through a sequence of phase transactions between In-phase locking\nstates to anti-phase locking states via phase-flip bifurcation. Moreover, we\nobserved the signature of frequency discretization (Frequency Island) and\nuncovered the physical mechanism for the existence of multi-stability near the\nphase transitions regimes. Within the windows between successive anti-phases to\nin-phase locking regions, optical injection induced modulation in alpha,\nunveiling a remarkable universal feature in the various dynamics of coupled\nlasers system which could be useful in controlling the chirp or pulse\nrepetition rate of a photonic integrated compact device with the aid of phase\ncontrol.\n", "  Optical frequency combs generated in normally dispersive Kerr microresonators\nhave been observed to correspond to dark temporal structures, and theoretically\nexplained as interlocked switching waves (also known as domain walls or\nfronts). The time-domain dynamics that underpin the formation of this type of\nfrequency combs has however so far eluded direct experimental observation. Here\nwe use a closely related system - a synchronously driven optical fibre ring\nresonator - to experimentally study the dynamics of deterministically excited\nswitching waves. We measure the switching wave velocities across broad\nparameter regions, and observe clear signatures of interlocking behaviour\nleading to the formation of persisting dark pulses. Our experimental findings\nare in good agreement with simulations of the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever\nequation, and strongly support the nature of normal-dispersion microresonator\nfrequency combs suggested in the literature.\n"]}
