Analytical results are derived for the stationary current response to\na constant bias without assuming any specific coupling to the external fields.\nIt is shown that anomalous large effective jump lengths, as observed in recent\nexperiments by taking the ratio of the third order nonlinear and the linear\nconductivity, can occur already in ordered systems. Rectification effects due\nto site energy disorder in ring systems are expected to become irrelevant for\nlarge system sizes. In open channels in contrast, rectification effects occur\nalready for disorder in the jump barriers and do not vanish in the\nthermodynamic limit. Numerical solutions for a sinusoidal bias show that the\nring system provides a good description for the transport behavior in the open\nchannel for intermediate and high frequencies. For low frequencies temporal\nvariations in the mean particle number have to be taken into account in the\nopen channel, which cannot be captured in the more simple ring model.\n", "  An alternative methodology to investigate indirect polyatomic processes with\nquasi-classical trajectories is proposed, which effectively avoids any binning\nor weighting procedure while provides rovibrational resolution. Initial\nclassical states are started in terms of angle-action variables to closely\nmatch the quantum experimental conditions and later transformed into Cartesian\ncoordinates, following an algorithm very recently published [J. Chem. Phys.\n130, 114103 (2009)]. Trajectories are then propagated using the 'association'\npicture, i.e. an inverse dynamics simulation in the spirit of the exit-channel\ncorrected phase space theory of Hamilton and Brumer [J. Chem. Phys. 82, 595\n(1985)], which is shown to be particularly convenient. Finally, an approximate\nquasi-classical formula is provided which under general conditions can be used\nto add possible rotational structures into the vibrationally-resolved\nquasi-classical distributions. To introduce the method and illustrate its\ncapabilities, correlated translational energy distributions from recent\nexperiments in the photo-dissociation of ketene at 308 nm [J. Chem. Phys. 124,\n014303 (2006)] are investigated. Quite generally, the overall theoretical\nalgorithm reduces the total number of trajectories to integrate and allows for\nfully theoretical predictions of experiments on polyatomics.\n", "  We develop an analytic model of vector correlations in rotationally inelastic\natom-diatom collisions and test it against the much examined Ar--NO ($\\mathbf\nX^2 \\Pi$) system. Based on the Fraunhofer scattering of matter waves, the model\nfurnishes complex scattering amplitudes needed to evaluate the polarization\nmoments characterizing the quantum stereodynamics. The analytic polarization\nmoments are found to be in an excellent agreement with experimental results and\nwith close-coupling calculations available at thermal energies. The model\nreveals that the stereodynamics is governed by diffraction from the repulsive\ncore of the Ar--NO potential, which can be characterized by a single Legendre\nmoment.\n", "  We investigated the spatial correlation between the arrival directions of the\nhighest energy cosmic rays (HECRs) detected by the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array\n(AGASA) with energies above $4 \\times 10^{19}$ eV and the positions of galaxies\nobserved by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) within $z = 0.024$. We\nsystematically tested the dependence of the correlation on the redshift ranges\nand properties of the galaxies, i.e., absolute luminosity, color, and\nmorphology, to understand where HECR sources are and what objects are HECR\nsources. In the systematic survey, we found potential signals of the positive\ncorrelation at small angular scale ($<10^{\\circ}$) with the (non-penalized)\nchance probability less than 5% in intermediate redshift ranges. Then, we\nestimated penalized probabilities to compensate the trial effects of angular\nscan, and found that the strongest correlation is produced by early-type\ngalaxies in $0.012 \\leq z < 0.018$ at 90% C.L. The possible origin of HECRs\nwhich correlating galaxies imply is also discussed.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the structural, electronic, magnetic and\nferroelectric properties of prototypical \\textit{proper} and \\textit{improper}\nmultiferroic (MF) systems such as BiFeO$_{3}$ and orthorhombic HoMnO$_{3}$,\nrespectively, within density functional theory (DFT) and using the\nHeyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE). By comparing our results with\navailable experimental data as well as with state-of-the-art GW calculations,\nwe show that the HSE formalism is able to account well for the relevant\nproperties of these compounds and it emerges as an accurate tool for predictive\nfirst-principles investigations on multiferroic systems. We show that effects\nbeyond local and semilocal DFT approaches (as provided by HSE) are necessary\nfor a realistic description of MFs. For the electric polarization, a decrease\nis found for MFs with magnetically-induced ferroelectricity, such as HoMnO$_3$,\nwhere the calculated polarization changes from $\\sim$ 6 $\\mu C/cm^2$ using\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) to $\\sim$ 2 $\\mu C/cm^2$ using HSE. However, for\n\\textit{proper} MFs, such as BiFeO$_{3}$, the polarization slightly increases\nupon introduction of exact exchange. Our findings therefore suggest that a\ngeneral trend for the HSE correction to bare density functional cannot be\nextracted; rather, a specific investigation has to be carried out on each\ncompound.\n", "  Dynamics of a coarse-grained model for the room-temperature ionic liquid,\n1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate, couched in the united-atom\nsite representation are studied via molecular dynamics simulations. The\ndynamically heterogeneous behavior of the model resembles that of fragile\nsupercooled liquids. At or close to room temperature, the model ionic liquid\nexhibits slow dynamics, characterized by nonexponential structural relaxation\nand subdiffusive behavior. The structural relaxation time, closely related to\nthe viscosity, shows a super-Arrhenius behavior. Local excitations, defined as\ndisplacement of an ion exceeding a threshold distance, are found to be mainly\nresponsible for structural relaxation in the alternating structure of cations\nand anions. As the temperature is lowered, excitations become progressively\nmore correlated. This results in the decoupling of exchange and persistence\ntimes, reflecting a violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation.\n", "  Our goal is to determine the rotational and magnetic-related activity\nproperties of stars at different stages of evolution. We have focussed our\nattention on 6 young loose stellar associations within 100 pc and ages in the\nrange 8-70 Myr: TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta Pictoris (~10 Myr), Tucana/Horologium,\nColumba, Carina (~30 Myr), and AB Doradus (~70 Myr). Additional data on alpha\nPersei and the Pleiades from the literature is also considered. Rotational\nperiods of stars showing rotational modulation due to photospheric magnetic\nactivity (i.e. starspots) have been determined applying the Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram technique to photometric time-series obtained by the All Sky\nAutomated Survey (ASAS). The magnetic activity level has been derived from the\namplitude of the V lightcurves. We detected the rotational modulation and\nmeasured the rotation periods of 93 stars for the first time, and confirmed the\nperiods of 41 stars already known from the literature. For further 10 stars we\nrevised the period determinations by other authors. The sample was augmented\nwith periods of 21 additional stars retrieved from the literature. In this way,\nfor the first time we were able to determine largest set of rotation periods at\nages of ~8, ~10 and ~30 Myr, as well as increase by 150\\% the number of known\nperiodic members of AB Dor.The analysis of the rotation periods in young\nstellar associations, supplemented by Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and NGC2264\ndata from the literature, has allowed us to find that in the 0.6 - 1.2 solar\nmasses range the most significant variations of the rotation period\ndistribution are the spin-up between 9 and 30 Myr and the spin-down between 70\nand 110 Myr. Variations between 30 and 70 Myr are rather doubtful, despite the\nmedian period indicates a significant spin-up.\n", "  Recent work suggests a link between chiral asymmetry in the amino acid\niso-valine extracted from the Murchison meteorite and the extent of hydrous\nalteration. We present the results of neutron scattering experiments on an\nexchanged, 1-dimensionally ordered n-propyl ammonium vermiculite clay. The\nvermiculite gel has a (001) d-spacing of order 5nm at the temperature and\nconcentration of the experiments and the d-spacing responds sensitively to\nchanges in concentration, temperature and electronic environment. The data show\nthat isothermal addition of D-histidine or L-histidine solutions produces\nshifts in the d-spacing that are different for each enantiomer. This chiral\nspecificity is of interest for the question of whether clays could have played\nan important role in the origin of biohomochirality.\n", "  Surveys based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect provide a fresh view of\nthe galaxy cluster population, one that is complementary to X-ray surveys. To\nbetter understand the relation between these two kinds of survey, we construct\nan empirical cluster model using scaling relations constrained by current X-ray\nand SZ data. We apply our model to predict the X-ray properties of the Planck\nSZ Cluster Catalog (PCC) and compare them to existing X-ray cluster catalogs.\nWe find that Planck should significantly extend the depth of the previous\nall-sky cluster survey, performed in the early 1990s by the ROSAT satellite,\nand should be particularly effective at finding hot, massive clusters (T > 6\nkeV) out to redshift unity. These are rare objects, and our findings suggest\nthat Planck could increase the observational sample at z > 0.6 by an order of\nmagnitude. This would open the way for detailed studies of massive clusters out\nto these higher redshifts. Specifically, we find that the majority of\nnewly-detected Planck clusters should have X-ray fluxes 10^{-13} ergs/s/cm^2 <\nf_X[0.5-2 keV] < 10^{-12} ergs/s/cm^2, i.e., distributed over the decade in\nflux just below the ROSAT All Sky Survey limit. This is sufficiently bright for\nextensive X-ray follow-up campaigns. Once Planck finds these objects,\nXMM-Newton and \\textit{Chandra} could measure temperatures to 10% for a sample\nof ~ 100 clusters in the range 0.5 < z < 1, a valuable increase in the number\nof massive clusters studied over this range.\n", "  Smectite clays are hydrated layer silicates that, like micas, occur naturally\nin abundance. Importantly, they have readily modifiable interlayer spaces that\nprovide excellent sites for nanochemistry. Vermiculite is one such smectite\nclay and in the presence of small chain-length alkyl-NH3Cl ions, forms\nsensitive, 1-D ordered model clay systems with expandable nano-pore inter-layer\nregions. These inter-layers readily adsorb organic molecules. N-propyl NH3Cl\nvermiculite clay gels were used to determine the adsorption of alanine, lysine\nand histidine by chiral HPLC. The results show that during reaction with fresh\nvermiculite interlayers, significant chiral enrichment of either L- and\nD-enantiomers occurs depending on the amino acid. Chiral enrichment of the\nsupernatant solutions is up to about 1% per pass. In contrast, addition to clay\ninterlayers already reacted with amino acid solutions resulted in little or no\nchange in D/L ratio during the time of the experiment. Adsorption of small\namounts of amphiphilic organic molecules in clay inter-layers is known to\nproduce Layer-by-Layer or Langmuir-Blodgett films. Moreover atomistic\nsimulations show that self-organization of organic species in clay interlayers\nis important. These non-centrosymmetric, chirally active nanofilms may cause\nclays to act subsequently as chiral amplifiers, concentrating organic material\nfrom dilute solution and having different adsorption energetics for D- and\nL-enantiomers. The additional role of clays in RNA oligimerization already\npostulated by Ferris and others, together with the need for the organization of\namphiphilic molecules and lipids noted by Szostak and others, suggests that\nsuch chiral separation by clays in lagoonal environments at normal biological\ntemperatures might also have played a significant role in the origin of\nbiochirality.\n", "  Originating from the weak interaction, parity violation in chiral molecules\nhas been considered as a possible origin of the biohomochirality. It was\npredicted in 1974 but has never been observed so far. Parity violation should\nlead to a very tiny frequency difference in the rovibrational spectra of the\nenantiomers of a chiral molecule. We have proposed to observe this predicted\nfrequency difference using the two photon Ramsey fringes technique on a\nsupersonic beam. Promising candidates for this experiment are chiral oxorhenium\ncomplexes, which present a large effect, can be synthesized in large quantity\nand enantiopure form, and can be seeded in a molecular beam. As a first step\ntowards our objective, a detailed spectroscopic study of methyltrioxorhenium\n(MTO) has been undertaken. It is an ideal test molecule as the achiral parent\nmolecule of chiral candidates for the parity violation experiment. For the\n187Re MTO isotopologue, a combined analysis of Fourier transform microwave and\ninfrared spectra as well as ultra-high resolution CO2 laser absorption spectra\nenabled the assignment of 28 rotational lines and 71 rovibrational lines, some\nof them with a resolved hyperfine structure. A set of spectroscopic parameters\nin the ground and first excited state, including hyperfine structure constants,\nwas obtained for the antisymmetric Re=O stretching mode of this molecule. This\nresult validates the experimental approach to be followed once a chiral\nderivative of MTO will be synthesized, and shows the benefit of the combination\nof several spectroscopic techniques in different spectral regions, with\ndifferent set-ups and resolutions. First high resolution spectra of jet-cooled\nMTO, obtained on the set-up being developed for the observation of molecular\nparity violation, are shown, which constitutes a major step towards the\ntargeted objective.\n", "  The capacity of Ti-capped sp carbon atomic chains for use as hydrogen storage\nmedia is studied using first-principles density functional theory. The Ti atom\nis strongly attached at one end of the carbon chains via d-p hybridization,\nforming stable TiCn complexes. We demonstrate that the number of adsorbed H2 on\nTi through Kubas interaction depends upon the chain types. For polyyne (n even)\nor cumulene (n odd) structures, each Ti atom can hold up to five or six H2\nmolecules, respectively. Furthermore, the TiC5 chain effectively terminated on\na C20 fullerene can store hydrogen with optimal binding of 0.52 eV/H2. Our\nresults reveal a possible way to explore high-capacity hydrogen storage\nmaterials in truly one-dimensional carbon structures.\n", "  This paper describes the image stacks and catalogs of the CFHT Legacy Survey\nproduced using using the MegaPipe data pipeline at the Canadian Astronomy Data\nCentre. The Legacy Survey is divided into to two parts: The Deep Survey\nconsists of 4 fields each of 1 square degree, with magnitude limits of u=27.5,\ng=27.9, r=27.7, i=27.4, and z=26.2, and contains 1.6 million sources. The Wide\nSurvey consists of 171 square degree pointings split over 4 fields, with\nmagnitude limits of u=26.0, g=26.5, r=25.9, i=25.7, and z=24.6, and contains 30\nmillion sources. This paper describes the calibration, image stacking and\ncatalog generation process. The images and catalogs are available on the web\nthrough several interfaces: normal image and text file catalog downloads, a\nGoogle Sky interface, an image cutout service, and a catalog database query\nservice.\n", "  Using density functional theory, we have investigated the structural,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of infinitely periodic organometallic\nvanadium-anthracene ($[V_2Ant]_\\infinity)$ and $[V_4(BNAnt)_2]_\\infinity$(where\nBNAnt is B-N analogue of anthracene) for their possible application in\nspintronics. From our calculations, we find that one-dimensional\n$[V_2Ant]_\\infinity$ and $[V_4(BNAnt)_2]_\\infinity$ wires exhibit robust\nferromagnetic half-metallic and metallic behavior, respectively. The finite\nsized $V_6Ant_2$ and $V_6(BNAnt)_2$ clusters are also found to exhibit\nefficient spin filter properties when coupled to graphene electrodes on either\nside.\n", "  We solve numerically a kinetic model of chiral polymerization in systems\nclosed to matter and energy flow, paying special emphasis to its ability to\namplify the small initial enantiomeric excesses due to the internal and\nunavoidable statistical fluctuations. The reaction steps are assumed to be\nreversible, implying a thermodynamic constraint among some of the rate\nconstants. Absolute asymmetric synthesis is achieved in this scheme. The system\ncan persist for long times in quasi- stationary chiral asymmetric states before\nracemizing. Strong inhibition leads to long-period chiral oscillations in the\nenantiomeric excesses of the longest homopolymer chains. We also calculate the\nentropy production {\\sigma} per unit volume and show that {\\sigma} increases to\na peak value either before or in the vicinity of the chiral symmetry breaking\ntransition.\n", "  The prime evidence underpinning the standard LCDM cosmological model is the\nCMB power spectrum as observed by WMAP and other microwave experiments. But\nSawangwit & Shanks (2010) have recently shown that the WMAP CMB power spectrum\nis highly sensitive to the beam profile of the WMAP telescope. Here, we use the\nsource catalogue from the Planck Early Data Release to test further the WMAP\nbeam profiles. We confirm that stacked beam profiles at Q, V and particularly\nat W appear wider than expected when compared to the Jupiter beam, normalised\neither directly to the radio source profiles or using Planck fluxes. The same\nresult is also found based on WMAP-CMBfree source catalogues and NVSS sources.\nThe accuracy of our beam profile measurements is supported by analysis of CMB\nsky simulations. However the beam profiles from WMAP7 at the W band are\nnarrower than previously found in WMAP5 data and the rejection of the WMAP beam\nis now only at the ~3sigma level. We also find that the WMAP source fluxes\ndemonstrate possible non-linearity with Planck fluxes. But including\nground-based and Planck data for the bright Weiland et al (2011) sources may\nsuggest that the discrepancy is a linear offset rather than a non-linearity.\nAdditionally, we find that the stacked Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) decrements of\n~151 galaxy clusters observed by Planck are in agreement with the WMAP data. We\nfind that there is no evidence for a WMAP SZ deficit as has previously been\nreported. In the particular case of Coma we find evidence for the presence of\nan ~0.1mK downwards CMB fluctuation. We conclude that beam profile systematics\ncan have significant effects on both the amplitude and position of the acoustic\npeaks, with potentially important implications for cosmology parameter fitting.\n", "  Massive clumps within the swept-up shells of bubbles, like that surrounding\nthe galactic HII region RCW 120, have been interpreted in terms of the Collect\nand Collapse (C&C) mechanism for triggered star formation. The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure. Hence, a shell-like configuration of massive clumps does not\nimply that the C&C mechanism is at work. Rather, we find a hybrid form of\ntriggering, which combines elements of C&C and Radiatively Driven Implosion\n(RDI). In addition, we investigate the reliability of deriving clump masses\nfrom their 870 micron emission. We find that for clumps with more than 100\nM_sun the observational estimates are accurate to within a factor of two and\nthat, even at these long wavelengths, it is important to account for the\nradiative heating from triggered, embedded protostars.\n", "  The number of cosmic strings in the observable universe is relevant in\ndetermining the probability of detecting such cosmic defects through their\ngravitational signatures. In particular, we refer to the observation of\ngravitational lensing events and anisotropy in the CMB radiation induced by\ncosmic strings. In this paper, a simple method is adopted to obtain an\napproximate estimate of the number of segments of cosmic strings, crossing the\nparticle horizon, which fall inside the observed part of the universe. We show\nthat there is an appreciable difference in the expected number of segments\nwhich differentiates cosmic strings arising in Abelian Higgs and Nambu-Goto\nmodels, and that a different choice of setting for the cosmological model can\nlead to significant differences in the expected number of cosmic string\nsegments. Of this number, the fraction realistically detectable may be\nconsiderably smaller.\n", "  We show that the Nariai-Bertotti Petrov type D, homogeneous solution of\nEinstein's vacuum field equations with a cosmological constant describes the\nspace-time in the interaction region following the head-on collision of two\nhomogeneous, plane gravitational shock waves each initially traveling in a\nvacuum containing no cosmological constant. A shock wave in this context has a\nstep function profile in contrast to an impulsive wave which has a delta\nfunction profile. Following the collision two light-like signals, each composed\nof a plane, homogeneous light-like shell of matter and a plane, homogeneous\nimpulsive gravitational wave, travel away from each other and a cosmological\nconstant is generated in the interaction region. Furthermore a plane,\nlight-like signal consisting of an electromagnetic shock wave accompanying a\ngravitational shock wave is described with the help of two real parameters, one\nfor each wave. The head-on collision of two such light-like signals is examined\nand we show that if a simple algebraic relation is satisfied between the two\npairs of parameters associated with each incoming light-like signal then the\nspace-time in the interaction region following the collision is a Bertotti\nspace-time which is a homogeneous solution of the vacuum Einstein-Maxwell field\nequations with a cosmological constant.\n", "  Hydrogen-based fuel cells are promising solutions for the efficient and clean\ndelivery of electricity. Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, a key step for\nthe development of a reliable hydrogen-based technology requires solving the\nissue of storage and transport of hydrogen. Several proposals based on the\ndesign of advanced materials such as metal hydrides and carbon structures have\nbeen made to overcome the limitations of the conventional solution of\ncompressing or liquefying hydrogen in tanks. Nevertheless none of these systems\nare currently offering the required performances in terms of hydrogen storage\ncapacity and control of adsorption/desorption processes. Therefore the problem\nof hydrogen storage remains so far unsolved and it continues to represent a\nsignificant bottleneck to the advancement and proliferation of fuel cell and\nhydrogen technologies. Recently, however, several studies on graphene, the\none-atom-thick membrane of carbon atoms packed in a honeycomb lattice, have\nhighlighted the potentialities of this material for hydrogen storage and raise\nnew hopes for the development of an efficient solid-state hydrogen storage\ndevice. Here we review on-going efforts and studies on functionalized and\nnanostructured graphene for hydrogen storage and suggest possible developments\nfor efficient storage/release of hydrogen at ambient conditions.\n", "  In quantum chemistry, the price paid by all known efficient model chemistries\nis either the truncation of the Hilbert space or uncontrolled approximations.\nTheoretical computer science suggests that these restrictions are not mere\nshortcomings of the algorithm designers and programmers but could stem from the\ninherent difficulty of simulating quantum systems. Extensions of computer\nscience and information processing exploiting quantum mechanics has led to new\nways of understanding the ultimate limitations of computational power.\nInterestingly, this perspective helps us understand widely used model\nchemistries in a new light. In this article, the fundamentals of computational\ncomplexity will be reviewed and motivated from the vantage point of chemistry.\nThen recent results from the computational complexity literature regarding\ncommon model chemistries including Hartree-Fock and density functional theory\nare discussed.\n", "  This chapter reviews the nature of turbulence in the Galactic interstellar\nmedium (ISM) and its connections to the star formation (SF) process. The ISM is\nturbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating, and is subject to heating and cooling\nprocesses that control its thermodynamic behavior. The turbulence in the warm\nand hot ionized components of the ISM appears to be trans- or subsonic, and\nthus to behave nearly incompressibly. However, the neutral warm and cold\ncomponents are highly compressible, as a consequence of both thermal\ninstability in the atomic gas and of moderately-to-strongly supersonic motions\nin the roughly isothermal cold atomic and molecular components. Within this\ncontext, we discuss: i) the production and statistical distribution of\nturbulent density fluctuations in both isothermal and polytropic media; ii) the\nnature of the clumps produced by thermal instability, noting that, contrary to\nclassical ideas, they in general accrete mass from their environment; iii) the\ndensity-magnetic field correlation (or lack thereof) in turbulent density\nfluctuations, as a consequence of the superposition of the different wave modes\nin the turbulent flow; iv) the evolution of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio\n(MFR) in density fluctuations as they are built up by dynamic compressions; v)\nthe formation of cold, dense clouds aided by thermal instability; vi) the\nexpectation that star-forming molecular clouds are likely to be undergoing\nglobal gravitational contraction, rather than being near equilibrium, and vii)\nthe regulation of the star formation rate (SFR) in such gravitationally\ncontracting clouds by stellar feedback which, rather than keeping the clouds\nfrom collapsing, evaporates and diperses them while they collapse.\n", "  Research on thermoelectrical energy conversion, the reuse of waste heat\nproduced by some mechanical or chemical processes to generate electricity, has\nrecently gained some momentum. The calculation of the electronic parameters\nentering the figure of merit of this energy conversion, and therefore the\ndiscovery of efficient materials, is usually performed starting from the\nLandauer's approach to quantum transport coupled with the Onsager's linear\nresponse theory. As it is well known, that approach suffers of certain serious\ndrawbacks. Here, we discuss alternative dynamical methods that can go beyond\nthe validity of the Landauer's/Onsager's approach for electronic transport.\nThey can be used to validate the predictions of the Landauer's/Onsager's\napproach and to investigate systems for which that approach has shown to be\nunsatisfactory.\n", "  Accurate and efficient approaches to predict the optical properties of\norganic semiconducting compounds could accelerate the search for efficient\norganic photovoltaic materials. Nevertheless, predicting the optical properties\nof organic semiconductors has been plagued by the inaccuracy or computational\ncost of conventional first-principles calculations. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that orbital-dependent density-functional theory based upon\nKoopmans' condition [Phys. Rev. B 82, 115121 (2010)] is apt at describing donor\nand acceptor levels for a wide variety of organic molecules, clusters, and\noligomers within a few tenths of an electron-volt relative to experiment, which\nis comparable to the predictive performance of many-body perturbation theory\nmethods at a fraction of the computational cost.\n", "  We present an online catalog of distance determinations for $\\rm 6036$ K\ngiants, most of which are members of the Milky Way's stellar halo. Their\nmedium-resolution spectra from SDSS/SEGUE are used to derive metallicities and\nrough gravity estimates, along with radial velocities. Distance moduli are\nderived from a comparison of each star's apparent magnitude with the absolute\nmagnitude of empirically calibrated color-luminosity fiducials, at the observed\n$(g-r)_0$ color and spectroscopic [Fe/H]. We employ a probabilistic approach\nthat makes it straightforward to properly propagate the errors in\nmetallicities, magnitudes, and colors into distance uncertainties. We also fold\nin ${\\it prior}$ information about the giant-branch luminosity function and the\ndifferent metallicity distributions of the SEGUE K-giant targeting\nsub-categories. We show that the metallicity prior plays a small role in the\ndistance estimates, but that neglecting the luminosity prior could lead to a\nsystematic distance modulus bias of up to 0.25 mag, compared to the case of\nusing the luminosity prior. We find a median distance precision of $16\\%$, with\ndistance estimates most precise for the least metal-poor stars near the tip of\nthe red-giant branch. The precision and accuracy of our distance estimates are\nvalidated with observations of globular and open clusters. The stars in our\ncatalog are up to 125 kpc distant from the Galactic center, with 283 stars\nbeyond 50 kpc, forming the largest available spectroscopic sample of distant\ntracers in the Galactic halo.\n", "  We upgraded the chemical network from the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry\n2006 to include isotopes such as ^{13}C and ^{18}O. This includes all\ncorresponding isotopologues, their chemical reactions and the properly scaled\nreaction rate coefficients. We study the fractionation behavior of\nastrochemically relevant species over a wide range of model parameters,\nrelevant for modelling of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). We separately\nanalyze the fractionation of the local abundances, fractionation of the total\ncolumn densities, and fractionation visible in the emission line ratios. We\nfind that strong C^+ fractionation is possible in cool C^+ gas. Optical\nthickness as well as excitation effects produce intensity ratios between 40 and\n400. The fractionation of CO in PDRs is significantly different from the\ndiffuse interstellar medium. PDR model results never show a fractionation ratio\nof the CO column density larger than the elemental ratio. Isotope-selective\nphoto-dissociation is always dominated by the isotope-selective chemistry in\ndense PDR gas. The fractionation of C, CH, CH^+, and HCO^+ is studied in\ndetail, showing that the fractionation of C, CH and CH^+ is dominated by the\nfractionation of their parental species. The light hydrides chemically derive\nfrom C^+, and, consequently, their fractionation state is coupled to that of\nC^+. The fractionation of C is a mixed case depending on whether formation from\nCO or HCO^+ dominates. Ratios of the emission lines of [C II], [C I], ^{13}CO,\nand H^{13}CO^+ provide individual diagnostics to the fractionation status of\nC^+, C, and CO.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are the most massive objects in the Universe and comprise a\nhigh-temperature intracluster medium of about 10^7 K, believed to offer a main\nforeground effect for cosmic microwave background (CMB) data in the form of the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This assumption has been confirmed by\nSZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge\nnumbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we\nintroduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most\ngalaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground\neffect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data\n(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the\nnearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified\ndata pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected\nby the sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds\nof pixels, we can see how the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We\nfind that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples\n(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP\nseven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each\noptically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean\ntemperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies\nthat the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected\nSZ effect. This may be the reason why the SZ signal detection result is lower\nthan expected from the model.\n", "  An isolated and fast decayed active region (NOAA 9729) was observed when\npassing through solar disk. There is only one CME related with it that give us\na good opportunity to investigate the whole process of the CME. Filament in\nthis active region rises up rapidly and then hesitates and disintegrates into\nflare loops. The rising filament from EIT images separates into two parts just\nbefore eruption. A new filament reforms several hours later after CME and the\naxis of this new one rotates clockwise about 22 degrees comparing with that of\nthe former one. We also observed a bright transient J-shaped X-ray sigmoid\nimmediately appears after filament eruption. It quickly develops into a soft\nX-ray cusp and rises up firstly then drops down. Two magnetic cancelation\nregions have been observed clearly just before filament eruption. Moreover, the\nmagnetic flux rope erupted as the magnetic helicity approach the maximum and\nthe normalized helicity is -0.036 when the magnetic flux rope erupted, which is\nclose to the prediction value based on the theoretical non-linear force-free\nmodel.\n", "  The evidence for the dark matter of the hot big bang cosmology is about as\ngood as it gets in natural science. The exploration of its nature is now led by\ndirect and indirect detection experiments, to be complemented by advances in\nthe full range of cosmological tests, including judicious consideration of the\nrich phenomenology of galaxies. The results may confirm ideas about DM already\nunder discussion. If we are lucky we also will be surprised once again.\n", "  The new Planck constraints on the local bispectrum parameter fnl are about\n10^5 times tighter than the current constraints on the trispectrum parameter\ngnl, which means that the allowed numerical values of the second and third\norder terms in the perturbative expansion of the curvature perturbation are\ncomparable. We show that a consequence of this is that if gnl is large enough\nto be detectable, then it will induce a large variation between the observable\nvalue of fnl and its value in a larger inflated volume. Even if there were only\na few extra efoldings between the beginning of inflation and horizon crossing\nof our Hubble horizon, an observably large gnl means that fnl is unlikely to be\nas small as its current constraint, regardless of its true background value.\nThis result is very general, it holds regardless of how many fields contributed\nto the curvature perturbation. We also generalise this result to other shapes\nof non-Gaussianity, beyond the local model. We show that the variance of the\n3-point function in the squeezed limit is bounded from below by the square of\nthe squeezed limit of the 4-point function.\n", "  We cross-correlate \\hip\\ main-sequence star catalog with \\fis\\ catalog, and\nidentify 136 stars (at $>90$% reliability) with far-infrared detections at\nleast in one band. After rejecting 51 stars classified as young stellar\nobjects, Be stars, other type stars with known dust disks or with potential\ncontaminations and 2 stars without infrared excess emission, we obtain a sample\nof 83 candidate stars with debris disks. Stars in our sample cover spectral\ntypes from B to K-types with most being early types. This represents an unique\nsample of luminous debris disks that derived uniformly from all sky survey with\na spatial resolution a factor of two better than the previous such survey by\n\\iras. Moreover, by collecting the infrared photometric data from other public\narchives, 85% of them have infrared excesses in more than one bands, allowing\nthe estimate of the dust temperatures. We fit the blackbody model to the broad\nband spectral energy distribution of these stars to derive the statistical\ndistribution of the disk parameters. 7 stars require an additional warm\ncomponent of temperature around 200 K. While a substantial fraction of our\nsample(58 stars) have weak 12 \\micron\\ excess indicating that a warm dust\ncomponent maybe common among these bright debris disk systems.\n", "  Glycolaldehyde, the simplest monosaccharide sugar, has recently been detected\nin low- and high-mass star-forming cores. Following on from our previous\ninvestigation into glycolaldehyde formation (Woods et al. 2012, ApJ, 750, 19),\nwe now consider a further mechanism for the formation of glycolaldehyde that\ninvolves the dimerisation of the formyl radical, HCO. Quantum mechanical\ninvestigation of the HCO dimerisation process upon an ice surface is predicted\nto be barrierless and therefore fast. In an astrophysical context, we show that\nthis mechanism can be very efficient in star-forming cores. It is limited by\nthe availability of the formyl radical, but models suggest that only very small\namounts of CO are required to be converted to HCO to meet the observational\nconstraints.\n", "  Recent studies of the nearest star-forming clouds of the Galaxy at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths with the Herschel Space Observatory have provided us\nwith unprecedented images of the initial conditions and early phases of the\nstar formation process. The Herschel images reveal an intricate network of\nfilamentary structure in every interstellar cloud. These filaments all exhibit\nremarkably similar widths - about a tenth of a parsec - but only the densest\nones contain prestellar cores, the seeds of future stars. The Herschel results\nfavor a scenario in which interstellar filaments and prestellar cores represent\ntwo key steps in the star formation process: first turbulence stirs up the gas,\ngiving rise to a universal web-like structure in the interstellar medium, then\ngravity takes over and controls the further fragmentation of filaments into\nprestellar cores and ultimately protostars. This scenario provides new insight\ninto the inefficiency of star formation, the origin of stellar masses, and the\nglobal rate of star formation in galaxies. Despite an apparent complexity,\nglobal star formation may be governed by relatively simple universal laws from\nfilament to galactic scales.\n", "  The reconstruction of galaxy cluster's gas density profiles is usually\nperformed by assuming spherical symmetry and averaging the observed X-ray\nemission in circular annuli. In the case of a very inhomogeneous and asymmetric\ngas distribution, this method has been shown to return biased results in\nnumerical simulations because of the $n^2$ dependence of the X-ray emissivity.\nWe propose a method to recover the true density profiles in the presence of\ninhomogeneities, based on the derivation of the azimuthal median of the surface\nbrightness in concentric annuli. We demonstrate the performance of this method\nwith numerical simulations, and apply it to a sample of 31 galaxy clusters in\nthe redshift range 0.04-0.2 observed with ROSAT/PSPC. The clumping factors\nrecovered by comparing the mean and the median are mild and show a slight trend\nof increasing bias with radius. For $R<R_{500}$, we measure a clumping factor\n$\\sqrt{C}<1.1$, which indicates that the thermodynamic properties and\nhydrostatic masses measured in this radial range are only mildly affected by\nthis effect. Comparing our results with three sets of hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations, we found that non-radiative simulations significantly overestimate\nthe level of inhomogeneities in the ICM, while the runs including cooling, star\nformation, and AGN feedback reproduce the observed trends closely. Our results\nindicate that most of the accretion of X-ray emitting gas is taking place in\nthe diffuse, large-scale accretion patterns rather than in compact structures.\n", "  We revisit Starobinsky inflation in a quantum gravitational context, by means\nof the exact Renormalisation Group (RG). We calculate the non-perturbative beta\nfunctions for Newton's `constant' G and the dimensionless R^2 coupling, and\nshow that there exists an attractive UV fixed point where the latter one\nvanishes but not the former one, and we provide the corresponding beta\nfunctions. The smallness of the R^2 coupling, required for agreement with\ninflationary observables, is naturally ensured by its vanishing at the UV fixed\npoint, ensuring the smallness of the primordial fluctuations, as well as\nproviding a theoretical motivation for the initial conditions needed for\nsuccessful inflation in this context. We discuss the corresponding RG dynamics,\nshowing both how inflationary and classical observations define the\nrenormalisation conditions for the couplings, and also how the UV regime is\nconnected with lower energies along the RG flow. Finally, we discuss the\nconsistency of our results when higher order curvature corrections are\nincluded, and show that they are robust to the inclusion of R^3 corrections.\n", "  The halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach has proven to be an effective\nmethod for modeling galaxy clustering and bias. In this approach, galaxies of a\ngiven type are probabilistically assigned to individual halos in N-body\nsimulations. In this paper, we present a fast emulator for predicting the fully\nnonlinear galaxy power spectrum over a range of freely specifiable HOD modeling\nparameters. The emulator is constructed using results from 100 HOD models run\non a large LCDM N-body simulation, with Gaussian Process interpolation applied\nto a PCA-based representation of the galaxy power spectrum. The total error is\ncurrently ~3% (~2% in the simulation and ~1% in the emulation process) from z=1\nto z=0, over the considered parameter range. We use the emulator to investigate\nparametric dependencies in the HOD model, as well as the behavior of galaxy\nbias as a function of HOD parameters. The emulator is publicly available at\nhttp://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/CosmicEmu/emu.html.\n", "  We combine photometric information of the WISE and 2MASS all-sky infrared\ndatabases, and demonstrate how to produce clean and complete galaxy catalogs\nfor future analyses. Adding 2MASS colors to WISE photometry improves\nstar-galaxy separation efficiency substantially at the expense of loosing a\nsmall fraction of the galaxies. We find that 93% of the WISE objects within\nW1<15.2 mag have a 2MASS match, and that a class of supervised machine learning\nalgorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), are efficient classifiers of objects\nin our multicolor data set. We constructed a training set from the SDSS\nPhotoObj table with known star-galaxy separation, and determined redshift\ndistribution of our sample from the GAMA spectroscopic survey. Varying the\ncombination of photometric parameters input into our algorithm we show that W1\n- J is a simple and effective star-galaxy separator, capable of producing\nresults comparable to the multi-dimensional SVM classification. We present a\ndetailed description of our star-galaxy separation methods, and characterize\nthe robustness of our tools in terms of contamination, completeness, and\naccuracy. We explore systematics of the full sky WISE-2MASS galaxy map, such as\ncontamination from Moon glow. We show that the homogeneity of the full sky\ngalaxy map is improved by an additional J<16.5 mag flux limit. The all-sky\ngalaxy catalog we present in this paper covers 21,200 sq. degrees with dusty\nregions masked out, and has an estimated stellar contamination of 1.2% and\ncompleteness of 70.1% among 2.4 million galaxies with $z_{med}= 0.14$.\nWISE-2MASS galaxy maps with well controlled stellar contamination will be\nuseful for spatial statistical analyses, including cross correlations with\nother cosmological random fields, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background. The\nsame techniques also yield a statistically controlled sample of stars as well.\n", "  We present measurements of the rates of high-redshift Type Ia supernovae\nderived from the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS). We carried out repeat\ndeep imaging observations with Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, and\ndetected 1040 variable objects over 0.918 deg$^2$ in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep\nField. From the imaging observations, light curves in the observed $i'$-band\nare constructed for all objects, and we fit the observed light curves with\ntemplate light curves. Out of the 1040 variable objects detected by the SXDS,\n39 objects over the redshift range $0.2 < z < 1.4$ are classified as Type Ia\nsupernovae using the light curves. These are among the most distant SN Ia rate\nmeasurements to date. We find that the Type Ia supernova rate increase up to $z\n\\sim 0.8$ and may then flatten at higher redshift. The rates can be fitted by a\nsimple power law, $r_V(z)=r_0(1+z)^\\alpha$ with\n$r_0=0.20^{+0.52}_{-0.16}$(stat.)$^{+0.26}_{-0.07}$(syst.)$\\times 10^{-4} {\\rm\nyr}^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, and\n$\\alpha=2.04^{+1.84}_{-1.96}$(stat.)$^{+2.11}_{-0.86}$(syst.).\n", "  We have developed a new formulation to obtain self-gravitating, axisymmetric\nconfigurations in permanent rotation. The formulation is based on the\nLagrangian variational principle, and treats not only barotropic but also\nbaroclinic equations of state, for which angular momentum distributions are not\nnecessarily cylindrical. We adopt a Monte Carlo technique, which is analogous\nto those employed in other fields, e.g. nuclear physics, in minimizing the\nenergy functional, which is evaluated on a triangulated mesh. This letter is a\nproof of principle and detailed comparisons with existing results will be\nreported in the sequel, but some test calculations are presented, in which we\nhave achieved an error of $O(10^{-4})$ in the Virial relation. We have in mind\nthe application of this method to two-dimensional calculations of the\nevolutions of rotating stars, for which the Lagrangian formulation is best\nsuited.\n", "  Galaxy clusters provide unique laboratories to study astrophysical processes\non large scales and are important probes for cosmology. X-ray observations are\ncurrently the best means of detecting and characterizing galaxy clusters. In\nthis paper we describe the construction of the REFLEX II galaxy cluster survey\nbased on the southern part of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. REFLEX II extends the\nREFLEX I survey by a factor of about two down to a flux limit of $1.8 \\times\n10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (0.1 - 2.4 keV). We describe the determination\nof the X-ray parameters, the process of X-ray source identification, and the\nconstruction of the survey selection function. The REFLEX II cluster sample\ncomprises currently 915 objects. A standard selection function is derived for a\nlower source count limit of 20 photons in addition to the flux limit. The\nmedian redshift of the sample is $z = 0.102$. Internal consistency checks and\nthe comparison to several other galaxy cluster surveys imply that REFLEX II is\nbetter than 90\\% complete with a contamination less than 10\\%.\n", "  We present thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) measurements for 42 galaxy\nclusters observed at 150 GHz with the APEX-SZ experiment. For each cluster, we\nmodel the pressure profile and calculate the integrated Comptonization $Y$ to\nestimate the total thermal energy of the intracluster medium (ICM). We compare\nthe measured $Y$ values to X-ray observables of the ICM from the literature\n(cluster gas mass $M_{\\rm{gas}}$, temperature $T_X$, and $Y_X\n=M_{\\rm{gas}}T_X$) that relate to total cluster mass. We measure power law\nscaling relations, including an intrinsic scatter, between the SZE and X-ray\nobservables for three subsamples within the set of 42 clusters that have\nuniform X-ray analysis in the literature. We observe that differences between\nthese X-ray analyses introduce significant variability into the measured\nscaling relations, particularly affecting the normalization. For all three\nsubsamples, we find results consistent with a self-similar model of cluster\nevolution dominated by gravitational effects. Comparing to predictions from\nnumerical simulations, these scaling relations prefer models that include\ncooling and feedback in the ICM. Lastly, we measure an intrinsic scatter of\n$\\sim28$ per cent in the $Y-Y_X\\,$ scaling relation for all three subsamples.\n", "  We study the spatially resolved stellar kinematics of two star-forming\ngalaxies at z = 0.1 from the larger DYnamics of Newly Assembled Massive Objects\n(DYNAMO) sample. These galaxies, which have been characterized by high levels\nof star formation and large ionized gas velocity dispersions, are considered\npossible analogs to high-redshift clumpy disks. They were observed using the\nGMOS instrument in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) mode at the Gemini\nObservatory with high spectral resolution (R=5400, equivalent to 24 km/s at the\nobserved wavelengths) and 6 hour exposure times in order to measure the\nresolved stellar kinematics via absorption lines. We also obtain higher-quality\nemission line kinematics than previous observations. The spatial resolution\n(1.2 kpc) is sufficient to show that the ionized gas in these galaxies (as\ntraced by H-beta emission) is morphologically irregular, forming multiple giant\nclumps while stellar continuum light is smooth and well described by an\nexponential profile. Clumpy gas morphologies observed in IFS data are confirmed\nby complementary narrow band H-alpha imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope.\nMorphological differences between the stars and ionized gas are not reflected\ndynamically as stellar kinematics are found the be closely coupled to the\nkinematics of the ionized gas: both components are smoothly rotating with large\nvelocity dispersions (~40 km/s) suggesting that the high gas dispersions are\nnot primarily driven by star-formation feedback. In addition, the stellar\npopulation ages of these galaxies are estimated to be quite young (60-500 Myr).\nThe large velocity dispersions measured for these young stars suggest that we\nare seeing the formation of thick disks and/or stellar bulges in support of\nrecent models which produce these from clumpy galaxies at high redshift.\n", "  Analyses of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters suggest\nthat X-ray masses can be underestimated by 10% to 30%. The largest bias\noriginates by both violation of hydrostatic equilibrium and an additional\ntemperature bias caused by inhomogeneities in the X-ray emitting intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM). To elucidate on this large dispersion among theoretical\npredictions, we evaluate the degree of temperature structures in cluster sets\nsimulated either with smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) and\nadaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) codes. We find that the SPH simulations produce\nlarger temperature variations connected to the persistence of both\nsubstructures and their stripped cold gas. This difference is more evident in\nno-radiative simulations, while it is reduced in the presence of radiative\ncooling. We also find that the temperature variation in radiative cluster\nsimulations is generally in agreement with the observed one in the central\nregions of clusters. Around R_500 the temperature inhomogeneities of the SPH\nsimulations can generate twice the typical hydrostatic-equilibrium mass bias of\nthe AMR sample. We emphasize that a detailed understanding of the physical\nprocesses responsible for the complex thermal structure in ICM requires\nimproved resolution and high sensitivity observations in order to extend the\nanalysis to higher temperature systems and larger cluster-centric radii.\n", "  The first building block to use galaxy clusters in astrophysics and cosmology\nis the accurate determination of their mass. Two of the most well regarded\ndirect mass estimators are based on weak lensing (WL) determinations or X-ray\nanalyses assuming hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). By comparing these two mass\nmeasurements in samples of rich clusters, we determined the intrinsic scatters,\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{WL}\\sim$15 per cent for WL masses and\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{HE}\\sim$25 per cent for HE masses. The certain assessment of\nthe bias is hampered by differences as large as $\\sim$40 per cent in either WL\nor HE mass estimates reported by different groups. If the intrinsic scatter in\nthe mass estimate is not considered, the slope of any scaling relation\n`observable--mass' is biased towards shallower values, whereas the intrinsic\nscatter of the scaling is over-estimated.\n", "  Context. The interpretation of polarised radiation emerging from a planetary\natmosphere must rely on solutions to the vector Radiative Transport Equation\n(vRTE). Monte Carlo integration of the vRTE is a valuable approach for its\nflexible treatment of complex viewing and/or illumination geometries and\nbecause it can intuitively incorporate elaborate physics. Aims. We present a\nnovel Pre-Conditioned Backward Monte Carlo (PBMC) algorithm for solving the\nvRTE and apply it to planetary atmospheres irradiated from above. As classical\nBMC methods, our PBMC algorithm builds the solution by simulating the photon\ntrajectories from the detector towards the radiation source, i.e. in the\nreverse order of the actual photon displacements. Methods. We show that the\nneglect of polarisation in the sampling of photon propagation directions in\nclassical BMC algorithms leads to unstable and biased solutions for\nconservative, optically-thick, strongly-polarising media such as Rayleigh\natmospheres. The numerical difficulty is avoided by pre-conditioning the\nscattering matrix with information from the scattering matrices of prior (in\nthe BMC integration order) photon collisions. Pre-conditioning introduces a\nsense of history in the photon polarisation states through the simulated\ntrajectories. Results. The PBMC algorithm is robust and its accuracy is\nextensively demonstrated via comparisons with examples drawn from the\nliterature for scattering in diverse media. Since the convergence rate for MC\nintegration is independent of the integral's dimension, the scheme is a\nvaluable option for estimating the disk-integrated signal of stellar radiation\nreflected from planets. Such a tool is relevant in the prospective\ninvestigation of exoplanetary phase curves. We lay out two frameworks for disk\nintegration and, as an application, explore the impact of atmospheric\nstratification on planetary phase curves...\n", "  The advent of the LHC, and the proposal of building future colliders as the\nILC, both programmed to explore new physics at the TeV scale, justifies the\nrecent interest in studying all kind of seesaw mechanisms whose signature lies\non such energy scale. The natural candidate for this kind of seesaw mechanism\nis the inverse one. The conventional inverse seesaw mechanism is implemented in\nan arrangement involving six new heavy neutrinos in addition to the three\nstandard ones. In this paper we develop the inverse seesaw mechanism based on\nHiggs triplet model and probe its signature at the LHC and ILC. We argue that\nthe conjoint analysis of the LHC together with the ILC may confirm the\nmechanism and, perhaps, infer the hierarchy of the neutrino masses.\n", "  In conventional model independent approaches, the power spectrum of\nprimordial perturbations is characterized by such free parameters as spectral\nindex, its running, the running of running, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. In\nthis work we, show that, at least for simple inflationary potentials, one can\nfind the primordial scalar and tensor power spectra exactly by resumming over\nall the running terms. In this model-dependent method, we expand the power\nspectra about the pivot scale to find the series terms as functions of the\ne-folding number for some single field models of inflation. Interestingly, for\nthe viable models studied here, one can sum over all the terms and evaluate the\nexact form of the power spectra. This in turn gives more accurate\nparametrization of the specific models studied in this work. We finally compare\nour results with the recent cosmic microwave background data to find that our\nnew power spectra are in good agreement with the data.\n", "  The phase space distribution of matter out to $\\sim 100 \\rm Mpc$ is probed by\ntwo types of observational data: galaxy redshift surveys and peculiar motions\nof galaxies. Important information on the process of structure formation and\ndeviations from standard gravity have been extracted from the accumulating\ndata.\n  The remarkably simple Zel'dovich approximation is the basis for much of our\ninsight into the dynamics of structure formation and the development of data\nanalyses methods.\n  Progress in the methodology and some recent results is reviewed.\n", "  Bailey & Basu (2014) show analysis of density and mass-to-flux ratio maps for\nsimulations with either an ionisation profile which takes into account\nphotoionisation (step-like profile) or a cosmic ray only ionisation profile. We\nextend this study to analyse the effect of these ionisation profiles on\nvelocity structures, kinematics, and synthetic spectra. Clump regions are found\nto occur at the convergence of two flows with a low velocity region and\nvelocity direction transition occurring at the junction. Models with evident\nsubstructure show that core formation occurs on the periphery of these velocity\nvalleys. Analysis of synthetic spectra reveals the presence of large\nnon-thermal components within low-density gas, especially for models with the\nstep-like ionisation profile. All cores show small, sub-thermal relative\nmotions compared to background gas. Large deviations within this analysis are\ndue to the line of sight intersecting low- and high-density regions across the\nvelocity switch transition. Positive deviations correspond to a foreground core\nmoving away from the observer while negative deviations correspond to a\nbackground core moving toward the observer. Comparison of velocities resulting\nfrom different ionisation profiles suggest that high ionisation fractions yield\nsupersonic velocities, up to two times the sound speed, while regions with low\nionisation fractions tend to be subsonic or mildly supersonic. This suggests\nthat the transition to coherence within cores could be a transition between\nhigh and low ionisation fractions within the gas.\n", "  We have developed an analytical method based on forward-modeling techniques\nto characterize the high-mass end of the red sequence (RS) galaxy population at\nredshift $z\\sim0.55$, from the DR10 BOSS CMASS spectroscopic sample, which\ncomprises $\\sim600,000$ galaxies. The method, which follows an unbinned maximum\nlikelihood approach, allows the deconvolution of the intrinsic CMASS\ncolour-colour-magnitude distributions from photometric errors and selection\neffects. This procedure requires modeling the covariance matrix for the i-band\nmagnitude, g-r colour and r-i colour using Stripe 82 multi-epoch data. Our\nresults indicate that the error-deconvolved intrinsic RS distribution is\nconsistent, within the photometric uncertainties, with a single point\n($<0.05~{\\rm{mag}}$) in the colour-colour plane at fixed magnitude, for a\nnarrow redshift slice. We have computed the high-mass end ($^{0.55}M_i \\lesssim\n-22$) of the $^{0.55}i$-band RS Luminosity Function (RS LF) in several redshift\nslices within the redshift range $0.52<z<0.63$. In this narrow redshift range,\nthe evolution of the RS LF is consistent, within the uncertainties in the\nmodeling, with a passively-evolving model with $\\Phi_* = (7.248 \\pm 0.204)\n\\times10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$, fading at a rate of $1.5\\pm0.4$ mag per\nunit redshift. We report RS completeness as a function of magnitude and\nredshift in the CMASS sample, which will facilitate a variety of\ngalaxy-evolution and clustering studies using BOSS. Our forward-modeling method\nlays the foundations for future studies using other dark-energy surveys like\neBOSS or DESI, which are affected by the same type of photometric\nblurring/selection effects.\n", "  Many weak lensing calculations make use of the Born approximation where the\nlight ray is approximated by a straight path. We examine the effect of\nBorn-corrections for lensing of the cosmic microwave background in an\nanalytical approach by taking perturbative corrections to the geodesic into\naccount. The resulting extra power in the lensing potential spectrum is\ncomparable to the power generated by nonlinear structure formation and affects\nespecially the polarisation spectra, leading to relative changes of the order\nof one per cent for the $E$-mode spectrum and up to 10 per cent on all scales\nto the $B$-mode spectrum. In contrast, there is only little change of spectra\ninvolving the CMB temperature. Additionally, the corrections excite one more\ndegree of freedom resulting in a deflection component which can not be\ndescribed as a gradient of the lensing potential as it is related to image\nrotation in lens-lens coupling. We estimate the magnitude of this effect on the\nCMB-spectra and find it to be negligible.\n", "  We have functionalized the sides of fd bacteriophage virions with\noligonucleotides to induce DNA hybridization driven self-assembly of high\naspect ratio filamentous particles. Potential impacts of this new structure\nrange from an entirely new building block in DNA origami structures, inclusion\nof virions in DNA nanostructures and nanomachines, to a new means of adding\nthermotropic control to lyotropic liquid crystal systems. A protocol for\nproducing the virions in bulk is reviewed. Thiolated oligonucleotides are\nattached to the viral capsid using a heterobifunctional chemical linker. A\ncommonly used system is utilized, where a sticky, single-stranded DNA strand is\nconnected to an inert double-stranded spacer to increase inter-particle\nconnectivity. Solutions of fd virions carrying complementary strands are mixed,\nannealed, and their aggregation is studied using dynamic light scattering\n(DLS), fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Aggregation\nis clearly observed on cooling, with some degree of local order, and is\nreversible when temperature is cycled through the DNA hybridization transition.\n", "  If the Universe undergoes a phase transition, at which global monopoles are\ncreated or destroyed, topology of its spatial sections can change. More\nspecifically, by making use of Myers' theorem, we show that, after a transition\nin which global monopoles form, spatial sections of a spatially flat Universe\nbecome finite and closed. This implies that global monopoles can change\ntopology of Universe's spatial sections (from infinite and open to finite and\nclosed). We emphasize that global monopoles cannot alter topology of the\nspace-time manifold.\n", "  In the present paper we study the evolution of the modes of a scalar field in\na cyclic cosmology. In order to keep the discussion clear, we study the\nfeatures of a scalar field in a toy model, a Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe\nwith a periodic scale factor, in which the universe expands, contracts and\nbounces infinite times, in the approximation in which the dynamic features of\nthis universe are driven by some external factor, without the backreaction of\nthe scalar field under study. In particular, we show that particle production\nexhibits features of the cyclic cosmology. Also, by studying the Berry phase of\nthe scalar field, we show that contrarily to what is commonly believed, the\nscalar field carries information from one bounce to another in the form of a\nglobal phase which occurs to be generically non-zero. {The Berry phase is then\nevaluated numerically in the case of the effective Loop Quantum Cosmology\nclosed Universe. We observe that Berry's phase is nonzero, but that in the\nquantum regime the particle content is non-negligible.\n", "  Many applications and algorithms in the field of gravitational lensing make\nuse of meshes with a finite number of nodes to analyze and manipulate data.\nSpecific examples in lensing are astronomical CCD images in general, the\nreconstruction of density distributions from lensing data, lens-source plane\nmapping or the characterization and interpolation of a point-spread-function.\nWe present a numerical framework to interpolate and differentiate in the\nmesh-free domain, defined by nodes with coordinates that follow no regular\npattern. The framework is based on radial basis functions (RBFs) to smoothly\nrepresent data around the nodes. We demonstrate the performance of Gaussian\nRBF-based, mesh-free interpolation and differentiation, which reaches the\nsub-percent level in both cases. We use our newly developed framework to\ntranslate ideas of free-form mass reconstruction from lensing onto the\nmesh-free domain. By reconstructing a simulated mock lens we find that strong\nlensing only reconstructions achieve < 10% accuracy in the areas where these\nconstraints are available but provide poorer results when departing from these\nregions. Weak-lensing only reconstructions give < 10% percent accuracy outside\nthe strong lensing regime, but cannot resolve the inner core structure of the\nlens. Once both regimes are combined, accurate reconstructions can be achieved\nover the full field of view. The reconstruction of a simulated lens, using\nconstraints that mimics real observations, yields accurate results in terms of\nsurface-mass density, NFW parameter, Einstein radius and magnification map\nrecovery, encouraging the application of this method to real data.\n", "  The delayed cosmology [JCAP 02(2012)046] assumes that the evolution of\ngeometries is delayed relative to that of matter and/or energies. This idea\nallows inflation occur without inflaton fields or vacuum energies of any kind\nas drivings. We considered the production and evolution of primordial\nperturbations in this model. The results indicate that, with delaying, we could\nget a nearly scale-free power spectrum of perturbations starting from a\nradiation dominated early universe.\n", "  In light of the recent Planck 2015 results for the measurement of the CMB\nanisotropy, we study simple inflationary models in the context of the\nGauss-Bonnet brane-world cosmology. The brane-world cosmological effect\nmodifies the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated by\ninflation and causes a dramatic change for the inflationary predictions of the\nspectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) from those obtained\nin the standard cosmology. In particular, the power spectrum of tensor\nperturbation is suppressed due to the Gauss-Bonnet brane-world cosmological\neffect, which is in sharp contrast with inflationary scenario in the\nRandall-Sundrum brane-world cosmology where the power spectrum is enhanced.\nHence, these two brane-world cosmological scenarios are distinguishable. With\nthe dramatic change of the inflationary predictions, the inflationary scenario\nin the Gauss-Bonnet brane-world cosmology can be tested by more precise\nmeasurements of $n_s$ and future observations of the CMB $B$-mode polarization.\n", "  We implement a conformal time scale factor duality for\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models, which is consistent with the\nweak energy condition. The requirement for self-duality determines the\nequations of state for a broad class of barotropic fluids. We study the example\nof a universe filled with two interacting fluids, presenting an accelerated and\na decelerated period, with manifest UV/IR duality. The associated self-dual\nscalar field interaction turns out to coincide with the \"radiation-like\"\nmodified Chaplygin gas models. We present an equivalent realization of them as\ngauged K\\\"ahler sigma models (minimally coupled to gravity) with very specific\nand interrelated K\\\"ahler- and super-potentials. Their applications in the\ndescription of hilltop inflation and also as quintessence models for the late\nuniverse are discussed.\n", "  We use direct numerical simulations to compute structure functions, scaling\nexponents, probability density functions and turbulent transport coefficients\nof passive scalars in turbulent rotating helical and non-helical flows. We show\nthat helicity affects the inertial range scaling of the velocity and of the\npassive scalar when rotation is present, with a spectral law consistent with\n$\\sim k_{\\perp}^{-1.4}$ for the passive scalar variance spectrum. This scaling\nlaw is consistent with the phenomenological argument presented in\n\\cite{imazio2011} for rotating non-helical flows, wich states that if energy\nfollows a $E(k)\\sim k^{-n}$ law, then the passive scalar variance follows a law\n$V(k) \\sim k^{-n_{\\theta}}$ with $n_{\\theta}=(5-n)/2$. With the second order\nscaling exponent obtained from this law, and using the Kraichnan model, we\nobtain anomalous scaling exponents for the passive scalar that are in good\nagreement with the numerical results. Intermittency of the passive scalar is\nfound to be stronger than in the non-helical rotating case, a result that is\nalso confirmed by stronger non-Gaussian tails in the probability density\nfunctions of field increments. Finally, Fick's law is used to compute the\neffective diffusion coefficients in the directions parallel and perpendicular\nto the rotation axis. Calculations indicate that horizontal diffusion decreases\nin the presence of helicity in rotating flows, while vertical diffusion\nincreases. We use a mean field argument to explain this behavior in terms of\nthe amplitude of velocity field fluctuations.\n", "  The OPERA experiment, exposed to the CERN to Gran Sasso $\\nu_\\mu$ beam,\ncollected data from 2008 to 2012. Four oscillated $\\nu_\\tau$ Charged Current\ninteraction candidates have been detected in appearance mode, which are\nconsistent with $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$ oscillations at the atmospheric $\\Delta\nm^2$ within the \"standard\" three-neutrino framework. In this paper, the OPERA\n$\\nu_\\tau$ appearance results are used to derive limits on the mixing\nparameters of a massive sterile neutrino.\n", "  With the discovery of the binary black hole coalescence GW150914, the era of\ngravitational-wave astrophysics has started. Gravitational-wave signals emitted\nby compact binary coalescences will be detected in large number by LIGO and\nVirgo in the coming months and years. Much about compact binaries is still\nuncertain, including some key details about their formation channels. The two\nscenarios which are typically considered, common envelope evolution and\ndynamical capture, result in different distributions for the orientation of the\nblack hole spins. In particular, common envelope evolution is expected to be\nhighly efficient in aligning spins with the orbital angular momentum. In this\npaper we simulate catalogs of gravitational-wave signals in which a given\nfraction of events comes from common envelop evolution, and has spins nearly\naligned with the orbital angular momentum. We show how the fraction of aligned\nsystems can be accurately estimated using Bayesian parameter estimation, with 1\n$\\sigma$ uncertainties of the order of 10% after 100-200 sources are detected.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate synchronization between two distinct ensembles\nof cold atoms undergoing steady state superradiance within a single\nlongitudinal and transverse mode of the same optical cavity. The\nsynchronization process is studied first in terms of the time dynamics of\nre-synchronization when the phase alignment of the two oscillators is abruptly\nbroken. We also observe the steady state behavior of the lasers as their\nrelative frequency is continuously varied. This system has the potential to\nrealize a non-equilibrium quantum phase transition and could inform future\nimplementations of milliHertz linewidth lasers.\n", "  In this paper we examine gauge coupling unification of the the non-SUSY\nSO(10) grand unified theory proposed by Babu and Mohapatra at the two loop\nlevel. This theory breaks down to the standard model in a single step and has\nthe distinguishing feature of TeV non-standard model scalars. This leads to a\nplethora of interesting new physics at the TeV scale and the discovery of new\nparticles at the LHC. This model gives rise to testable proton decay,\nneutron-antineutron oscillations, provides a mechanism for baryogenesis, and\ncontains potential dark matter candidates. In this paper, we compute the two\nloop beta function and show that this model unifies to two loop order around\n$10^{15}$ GeV. We then compute the proton lifetime, taking into account\nthreshold effects and show that these effects place it above the Super\nKamiokande limit.\n", "  We present a new method of finding cosmic voids using tomographic maps of\nLy{\\alpha} forest flux. We identify cosmological voids with radii of 2 - 12\n$h^{-1}$Mpc in a large N-body simulation at $z = 2.5$, and characterize the\nsignal of the high-redshift voids in density and Ly{\\alpha} forest flux. The\nvoid properties are similar to what has been found at lower redshifts, but they\nare smaller and have steeper radial density profiles. Similarly to what has\nbeen found for low-redshift voids, the radial velocity profiles have little\nscatter and agree very well with the linear theory prediction. We run the same\nvoid finder on an ideal Ly{\\alpha} flux field and tomographic reconstructions\nat various spatial samplings. We compare the tomographic map void catalogs to\nthe density void catalog and find good agreement even with modest-sized voids\n($r > 6 \\, h^{-1}$Mpc). Using our simple void-finding method, the configuration\nof the ongoing CLAMATO survey covering 1 deg$^2$ would provide a sample of\nabout 100 high-redshift voids. We also provide void-finding forecasts for\nlarger area surveys, and discuss how these void samples can be used to test\nmodified gravity models, study high-redshift void galaxies, and to make an\nAlcock-Paczynski measurement. To aid future work in this area, we provide\npublic access to our simulation products, catalogs, and sample tomographic flux\nmaps.\n", "  We present SymPix, a special-purpose spherical grid optimized for efficient\nsampling of rotationally invariant linear operators. This grid is conceptually\nsimilar to the Gauss-Legendre (GL) grid, aligning sample points with\niso-latitude rings located on Legendre polynomial zeros. Unlike the GL grid,\nhowever, the number of grid points per ring varies as a function of latitude,\navoiding expensive over-sampling near the poles and ensuring nearly equal sky\narea per grid point. The ratio between the number of grid points in two\nneighbouring rings is required to be a low-order rational number (3, 2, 1, 4/3,\n5/4 or 6/5) to maintain a high degree of symmetries. Our main motivation for\nthis grid is to solve linear systems using multi-grid methods, and to construct\nefficient preconditioners through pixel-space sampling of the linear operator\nin question. The GL grid is not suitable for these purposes due to its massive\nover-sampling near the poles, leading to nearly degenerate linear systems,\nwhile HEALPix, another commonly used spherical grid, exhibits few symmetries,\nand is therefore computationally inefficient for these purposes. As a benchmark\nand representative example, we compute a preconditioner for a linear system\nwith both HEALPix and SymPix that involves the operator $D + B^T N^{-1} B$,\nwhere $B$ and $D$ may be described as both local and rotationally invariant\noperators, and $N$ is diagonal in pixel domain. For a bandwidth limit of\n$\\ell_\\text{max}=3000$, we find that SymPix, due to its higher number of\ninternal symmetries, yields average speed-ups of 360 and 23 for $B^T N^{-1} B$\nand $D$, respectively, relative to HEALPix.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological production of gravitational waves in a\nnonsingular flat cosmology powered by a \"running vacuum\" energy density\ndescribed by $\\rho_{\\Lambda}\\equiv\\rho_{\\Lambda}(H)$, a phenomenological\nexpression potentially linked with the renormalization group approach in\nquantum field theory in curved spacetimes. The model can be interpreted as a\nparticular case of the class recently discussed by Perico et al. (Phys. Rev. D\n{\\bf 88}, 063531, 2013) which is termed complete in the sense that the cosmic\nevolution occurs between two extreme de Sitter stages (early and late time de\nSitter phases). {The gravitational wave equation is derived and its\ntime-dependent part numerically integrated since the primordial de Sitter\nstage. The generated spectrum of gravitons is also compared with the standard\ncalculations where an abrupt transition, from the early de Sitter to the\nradiation phase, is usually assumed.} It is found that the stochastic\nbackground of gravitons is very similar to the one predicted by the cosmic\nconcordance model plus inflation except at higher frequencies ($\\nu \\gtrsim\n100$ kHz). This remarkable signature of a \"running vacuum\" cosmology combined\nwith the proposed high frequency gravitational wave detectors and measurements\nof the CMB polarization (B-modes) may provide a new window to confront more\nconventional models of inflation.\n", "  We use a Bayesian software package to analyze CARMA-8 data towards 19\nunconfirmed Planck SZ-cluster candidates from Rodriguez-Gonzalvez et al.\n(2015), that are associated with significant overdensities in WISE. We used two\ncluster parameterizations, one based on a (fixed shape) generalized-NFW\npressure profile and another based on a beta-gas-density profile (with varying\nshape parameters) to obtain parameter estimates for the nine CARMA-8\nSZ-detected clusters. We find our sample is comprised of massive,\nY_{500}=0.0010 \\pm 0.0015 arcmin^2, relatively compact, theta_{500}= 3.9 \\pm\n2.0 arcmin systems. Results from the beta model show that our cluster\ncandidates exhibit a heterogeneous set of brightness-temperature profiles.\nComparison of Planck and CARMA-8 measurements showed good agreement in Y_{500}\nand an absence of obvious biases. We estimated the total cluster mass M_{500}\nas a function of z for one of the systems; at the preferred photometric\nredshift of 0.5, the derived mass, M_{500} \\approx 0.8 \\pm 0.2 \\times 10^{15}\nMsun. Spectroscopic Keck/MOSFIRE data confirmed a galaxy member of one of our\ncluster candidates to be at z=0.565. Applying a Planck prior in Y_{500} to the\nCARMA-8 results reduces uncertainties for both parameters by a factor >4,\nrelative to the independent Planck or CARMA-8 measurements. We here demonstrate\na powerful technique to find massive clusters at intermediate z \\gtrsim 0.5\nredshifts using a cross-correlation between Planck and WISE data, with\nhigh-resolution follow-up with CARMA-8. We also use the combined capabilities\nof Planck and CARMA-8 to obtain a dramatic reduction by a factor of several, in\nparameter uncertainties.\n", "  We investigate how galaxies in VIPERS (the VIMOS Public Extragalactic\nRedshift Survey) inhabit the cosmological density field by examining the\ncorrelations across the observable parameter space of galaxy properties and\nclustering strength. The high-dimensional analysis is made manageable by the\nuse of group-finding and regression tools. We find that the major trends in\ngalaxy properties can be explained by a single parameter related to stellar\nmass. After subtracting this trend, residual correlations remain between galaxy\nproperties and the local environment pointing to complex formation\ndependencies. As a specific application of this work we build subsamples of\ngalaxies with specific clustering properties for use in cosmological tests.\n", "  In a metastable de Sitter space any object has a finite life expectancy\nbeyond which it undergoes vacuum decay. However, by spreading into different\nparts of the universe which will fall out of causal contact of each other in\nfuture, a civilization can increase its collective life expectancy, defined as\nthe average time after which the last settlement disappears due to vacuum\ndecay. We study in detail the collective life expectancy of two comoving\nobjects in de Sitter space as a function of the initial separation, the horizon\nradius and the vacuum decay rate. We find that even with a modest initial\nseparation, the collective life expectancy can reach a value close to the\nmaximum possible value of 1.5 times that of the individual object if the decay\nrate is less than 1% of the expansion rate. Our analysis can be generalized to\nany number of objects, general trajectories not necessarily at rest in the\ncomoving coordinates and general FRW space-time. As part of our analysis we\nfind that in the current state of the universe dominated by matter and\ncosmological constant, the vacuum decay rate is increasing as a function of\ntime due to accelerated expansion of the volume of the past light cone. Present\ndecay rate is about 3.7 times larger than the average decay rate in the past\nand the final decay rate in the cosmological constant dominated epoch will be\nabout 56 times larger than the average decay rate in the past. This\nconsiderably weakens the lower bound on the half-life of our universe based on\nits current age.\n", "  Assuming Majorana nature of neutrinos, we investigate the singular one\ntexture zero neutrino mass matrices in the flavor basis. We find that for the\nnormal mass ordering with $m_1=0$, all the six one texture zero classes are now\nruled out at 3$\\sigma$ confidence level, whereas for inverted mass ordering\nwith $m_3=0$ only four classes out of total six can accommodate the latest\nneutrino oscillation data at 3$\\sigma$ confidence level. Moreover, only two\nclasses can accommodate the present data at 1$\\sigma$ confidence level. We\nexamine the phenomenological implications of the allowed classes for the\neffective Majorana mass, Dirac and Majorana CP-violating phases. Working within\nthe framework of type-I seesaw mechanism, we present simple discrete Abelian\nsymmetry models leading to all the phenomenologically allowed classes.\n", "  We investigate the influence of different analytical parameterizations and\nfit functions for the local star formation rate in AMR simulations of an\nisolated disk galaxy with the Nyx code. Such parameterizations express the star\nformation efficiency as function of the local turbulent Mach number and virial\nparameter. By employing the method of adaptively refined large eddy\nsimulations, we are able to evaluate these physical parameters from the\nnumerically unresolved turbulent energy associated with the grid scale. We\nconsider both single and multi free-fall variants of star formation laws\nproposed by Padoan & Nordlund, Hennebelle & Chabrier, and Krumholz & McKee,\nsummarised and tested recently with numerical simulations by Federrath &\nKlessen. We find that the global star formation rate and the relation between\nthe local star formation rate and the gas column density is reproduced in\nagreement with observational constraints by all multi free-fall models of star\nformation. Some models with obsolete calibration or a single free-fall time\nscale, however, result in an overly clumpy disk that does not resemble the\nstructure of observed spirals.\n", "  In this paper we revisit and update the computation of thermal corrections to\nthe stability of the electroweak vacuum in the Standard Model. At zero\ntemperature, we make use of the full two-loop effective potential, improved by\nthree-loop beta functions with two-loop matching conditions. At finite\ntemperature, we include one-loop thermal corrections together with resummation\nof daisy diagrams. We solve numerically---both at zero and finite\ntemperature---the bounce equation, thus providing an accurate description of\nthe thermal tunneling. Assuming a maximum temperature in the early Universe of\nthe order of $10^{18}$ GeV, we find that at finite temperature the instability\nbound excludes values of the top mass $M_t \\gtrsim 173.6$ GeV, with $M_h \\simeq\n125$ GeV and including uncertainties on the strong coupling. We discuss the\nvalidity and temperature-dependence of this bound in the early Universe, with a\nspecial focus on the reheating phase after inflation.\n", "  The dislocation in Dirac semimetal carries an emergent magnetic flux parallel\nto the dislocation axis. We show that due to the emergent magnetic field the\ndislocation accommodates a single fermion massless mode of the corresponding\nlow-energy one-particle Hamiltonian. The mode is propagating along the\ndislocation with its spin directed parallel to the dislocation axis. In\nagreement with the chiral anomaly observed in Dirac semimetals, an external\nelectric field results in the spectral flow of the one-particle Hamiltonian, in\npumping of the fermionic quasiparticles out from the vacuum, and in creating a\nnonzero axial (chiral) charge in the vicinity of the dislocation.\n", "  G-band bright points (GBPs) are thought to be the foot-points of magnetic\nflux tubes. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relation between the\ndiffusion regimes of GBPs and the associated longitudinal magnetic field\nstrengths. Two high resolution observations of different magnetized\nenvironments were acquired with the Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope. Each\nobservation was recorded simultaneously with G-band filtergrams and Narrow-band\nFilter Imager (NFI) Stokes I and V images. GBPs are identified and tracked\nautomatically, and then categorized into several groups by their longitudinal\nmagnetic field strengths, which are extracted from the calibrated NFI\nmagnetograms using a point-by-point method. The Lagrangian approach and the\ndistribution of diffusion indices approach are adopted separately to explore\nthe diffusion regime of GBPs for each group. It is found that the values of\ndiffusion index and diffusion coefficient both decrease exponentially with the\nincreasing longitudinal magnetic field strengths whichever approach is used.\nThe empirical formulas deduced from the fitting equations are proposed to\ndescribe these relations. Stronger elements tend to diffuse more slowly than\nweak elements, independently of the magnetic flux of the surrounding medium.\nThis may be because the magnetic energy of stronger elements is not negligible\ncompared with the kinetic energy of the gas, and therefore the flows cannot\nperturb them so easily.Yang\n", "  We report results of quantum chemical calculations for the neutral and\nanionic species of (4,4{'})-bipyridine (44BPY), a prototypical molecule with a\nfloppy degree of freedom, placed in vacuo and in solvents. In addition to\nequilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies and spectra, we present\nadiabatic energy curves for the vibrational modes with significant\nintramolecular reorganization upon charge transfer. Special attention is paid\nto the floppy strongly anharmonic degree of freedom of 44BPY, which is related\nto the most salient structural feature, namely the twist angle $\\theta$ between\nthe two pyridine rings. The relevance of the present results for molecular\ntransport will be emphasized. We show that the solvent acts as an effective\ngate electrode and propose a scissor operator to account for solvent effects on\nmolecular transport. Our result on the conductance $G$ vs. $\\cos^2\\theta$ is\nconsistent with a significant transmission in perpendicular conformation\nindicated by previous microscopic analysis.\n", "  In this paper, we establish a general relation which directly links the\ndissipated work done on a system driven arbitrarily far from equilibrium, a\nfundamental quantity in thermodynamics, and the R\\'{e}nyi divergences, a\nfundamental concept in information theory. Specifically, we find that the\ngenerating function of the dissipated work under an arbitrary time-dependent\ndriving process is related to the R\\'{e}nyi divergences between a\nnon-equilibrium state in the driven process and a non-equilibrium state in its\ntime reversed process. This relation is a consequence of time reversal symmetry\nin driven process and is universally applicable to both finite classical system\nand finite quantum system, arbitrarily far from equilibrium.\n", "  We present the results of work involving a statistically complete sample of\n34 galaxy clusters, in the redshift range 0.15$\\le$z$\\le$0.3 observed with\n$Chandra$. We investigate the luminosity-mass ($LM$) relation for the cluster\nsample, with the masses obtained via a full hydrostatic mass analysis. We\nutilise a method to fully account for selection biases when modeling the $LM$\nrelation, and find that the $LM$ relation is significantly different than the\nrelation modelled when not account for selection effects. We find that the\nluminosity of our clusters is 2.2$\\pm$0.4 times higher (when accounting for\nselection effects) than the average for a given mass, its mass is 30% lower\nthan the population average for a given luminosity. Equivalently, using the\n$LM$ relation measured from this sample without correcting for selection biases\nwould lead to the underestimation by 40% of the average mass of a cluster with\na given luminosity. Comparing the hydrostatic masses to mass estimates\ndetermined from the $Y_{X}$ parameter, we find that they are entirely\nconsistent, irrespective of the dynamical state of the cluster.\n", "  The statistical properties of the temperature anisotropies and polarization\nof the of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offer a powerful probe of\nthe physics of the early universe. In recent works a statistical procedure\nbased upon the calculation of the kurtosis and skewness of the data in patches\nof CMB sky-sphere has been proposed and used to investigate the large-angle\ndeviation from Gaussianity in WMAP maps. Here we briefly address the question\nas to how this analysis of Gaussianity is modified if the foreground-cleaned\nPlanck maps are considered. We show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck\nmaps present significant deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when a\nless severe mask is used, they become consistent with Gaussianity, as detected\nby our indicators, when masked with the union mask U73.\n", "  We present multiwavelength, multi-telescope, ground-based follow-up\nphotometry of the white dwarf WD 1145+017, that has recently been suggested to\nbe orbited by up to six or more, short-period, low-mass, disintegrating\nplanetesimals. We detect 9 significant dips in flux of between 10% and 30% of\nthe stellar flux from our ground-based photometry. We observe transits deeper\nthan 10% on average every ~3.6 hr in our photometry. This suggests that WD\n1145+017 is indeed being orbited by multiple, short-period objects. Through\nfits to the multiple asymmetric transits that we observe, we confirm that the\ntransit egress timescale is usually longer than the ingress timescale, and that\nthe transit duration is longer than expected for a solid body at these short\nperiods, all suggesting that these objects have cometary tails streaming behind\nthem. The precise orbital periods of the planetesimals in this system are\nunclear from the transit-times, but at least one object, and likely more, have\norbital periods of ~4.5 hours. We are otherwise unable to confirm the specific\nperiods that have been reported, bringing into question the long-term stability\nof these periods. Our high precision photometry also displays low amplitude\nvariations suggesting that dusty material is consistently passing in front of\nthe white dwarf, either from discarded material from these disintegrating\nplanetesimals or from the detected dusty debris disk. For the significant\ntransits we observe, we compare the transit depths in the V- and R-bands of our\nmultiwavelength photometry, and find no significant difference; therefore, for\nlikely compositions the radius of single-size particles in the cometary tails\nstreaming behind the planetesimals in this system must be ~0.15 microns or\nlarger, or ~0.06 microns or smaller, with 2-sigma confidence.\n", "  Natural supersymmetric theories of the weak scale are under growing pressure\ngiven present LHC constraints, raising the question of whether untuned\nsupersymmetric (SUSY) solutions to the hierarchy problem are possible. In this\npaper, we explore a class of 5-dimensional natural SUSY theories in which SUSY\nis broken by the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We pedagogically explain how\nScherk-Schwarz elegantly solves the traditional problems of 4-dimensional SUSY\ntheories (based on the MSSM and its many variants) that usually result in an\nunsettling level of fine-tuning. The minimal Scherk-Schwarz set up possesses\nnovel phenomenology, which we briefly outline. We show that achieving the\nobserved physical Higgs mass motivates extra structure that does not\nsignificantly affect the level of tuning (always better than $\\sim 10\\%$) and\nwe explore three qualitatively different extensions: the addition of extra\nmatter that couples to the Higgs, an extra $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge group under\nwhich the Higgs is charged and an NMSSM-like solution to the Higgs mass\nproblem.\n", "  On the triangular and kagome lattices, short-ranged resonating valence bond\n(RVB) wave functions can be sampled without the sign problem using a\nrecently-developed Pfaffian Monte Carlo scheme. In this paper, we study the\nRenyi entanglement entropy in these wave functions using a replica-trick\nmethod. Using various spatial bipartitions, including the Levin-Wen\nconstruction, our finite-size scaled Renyi entropy gives a topological\ncontribution consistent with $\\gamma = \\text{ln}(2)$, as expected for a gapped\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid. We prove that the mutual statistics are\nconsistent with the toric code anyon model and rule out any other quasiparticle\nstatistics such as the double semion model.\n", "  The presence of megaparsec-scale radio halos in galaxy clusters has already\nbeen established by many observations over the last two decades. The emerging\nexplanation for the formation of these giant sources of diffuse synchrotron\nradio emission is that they trace turbulent regions in the intracluster medium,\nwhere particles are trapped and accelerated during cluster mergers. Our current\nobservational knowledge is, however, mainly limited to massive systems. Here we\npresent observations of a sample of 14 mass-selected galaxy clusters, i.e.\n$M_{\\rm 500} > 4\\times10^{14}$~M${_\\odot}$, in the Southern Hemisphere, aimed\nto study the occurrence of radio halos in low mass clusters and test the\ncorrelation between the radio halo power at 1.4 GHz $P_{\\rm 1.4}$ and the\ncluster mass $M_{\\rm 500}$. Our observations were performed with the 7-element\nKaroo Array Telescope at 1.86 GHz. We found three candidates to host diffuse\ncluster-scale emission and derived upper limits at the level of $0.6 - 1.9\n\\times 10^{24}$~Watt~Hz$^{-1}$ for $\\sim 50\\%$ of the clusters in the sample,\nsignificantly increasing the number of clusters with radio halo information in\nthe considered mass range. Our results confirm that bright radio halos in less\nmassive galaxy clusters are statistically rare.\n", "  We show how several properties of the QCD axion can be extracted at high\nprecision using only first principle QCD computations. By combining NLO results\nobtained in chiral perturbation theory with recent Lattice QCD results the full\naxion potential, its mass and the coupling to photons can be reconstructed with\npercent precision. Axion couplings to nucleons can also be derived reliably,\nwith uncertainties smaller than ten percent. The approach presented here allows\nthe precision to be further improved as uncertainties on the light quark masses\nand the effective theory couplings are reduced. We also compute the finite\ntemperature dependence of the axion potential and its mass up to the crossover\nregion. For higher temperature we point out the unreliability of the\nconventional instanton approach and study its impact on the computation of the\naxion relic abundance.\n", "  The photoelectron spectrum in the ultra-relativistic limit of tunneling\nionization is strongly affected by wave-particle resonance and finite spot-size\neffects, in contradistinction with the usual assumptions of strong field\nphysics. Near term laser facilities will access a regime where ionized\nelectrons are abruptly accelerated in the laser propagation direction, such\nthat they stay in phase with the laser fields through a substantial portion of\nthe confocal region. The final momentum of the electron depends significantly\non where in the confocal region it originated. By manipulating the target and\ncollection geometry, it is possible to obtain low emittance, low energy spread,\ngigavolt photoelectrons. Radiation reaction effects play a negligible role in\nnear term scenarios, but become interesting in the multi-exawatt regime. A\nsignificant advance in numerical particle tracking is introduced.\n", "  In this work we reformulate the forward modelling of the redshift-space power\nspectrum multipole moments for a masked density field, as encountered in galaxy\nredshift surveys. Exploiting the symmetries of the redshift-space correlation\nfunction, we provide a masked-field generalisation of the Hankel transform\nrelation between the multipole moments in real and Fourier space. Using this\nresult, we detail how a likelihood analysis requiring computation for a broad\nrange of desired $P(k)$ models may be executed $10^3-10^4$ times faster than\nwith other common approaches, together with significant gains in spectral\nresolution. We present a concrete application to the complex angular geometry\nof the VIPERS PDR-1 release and discuss the validity of this technique for\nfinite-angle surveys.\n", "  Thermal corrections to Schwinger pair production are potentially important in\nparticle physics, nuclear physics and cosmology. However, the lowest-order\ncontribution, arising at one loop, has proved difficult to calculate\nunambiguously. We show that this thermal correction may be calculated for\ncharged scalars using the worldline formalism, where each term in the decay\nrate is associated with a worldline instanton. We calculate all\nfinite-temperature worldline instantons, their actions and fluctuations\nprefactors, thus determining the complete one-loop decay rate at finite\ntemperature. The thermal contribution to the decay rate becomes nonzero at a\nthreshold temperature $T=eE/2m$, above which it dominates the zero temperature\nresult. This is the lowest of an infinite set of thresholds at $T=neE/2m$. The\ndecay rate is singular at each threshold as a consequence of the failure of the\nquadratic approximation to the worldline path integral. We argue that that\nhigher-order effects will make the decay rates finite everywhere, and model\nthose effects by the inclusion of hard thermal loop damping rates. We also\ndemonstrate that the formalism developed here generalizes to the case of\nfinite-temperature pair production in inhomogeneous fields.\n", "  Knowledge of the scatter in the mass-observable relation is a key ingredient\nfor a cosmological analysis based on galaxy clusters in a photometric survey.\nIn this paper we aim to quantify the capability of the correlation function of\ngalaxy cluster to constrain the intrinsic scatter $\\sigma_{\\ln M}$. We\ndemonstrate how the linear bias measured in the correlation function of\nclusters can be used to determine the value of this parameter. The new method\nis tested in simulations of a $5, 000 deg^2$ optical survey up to $z \\sim 1$,\nsimilar to the ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES). Our results show that our\nmethod works better at lower scatter values. We can measured the intrinsic\nscatter $\\sigma_{ln M} = 0.1$ with a standard deviation of $\\sigma(\\sigma_{ln\nM}) \\sim 0.03$ using this technique. However, the expected intrinsic scatter of\nthe DES RedMaPPer cluster catalog $\\sigma_{ln M} \\sim 0.2$ cannot be recovered\nwith this method at suitable accuracy and precision because the area coverage\nis insufficient. For future photometric surveys with a larger area such as LSST\nand Euclid, the statistical errors will be reduced. Therefore, we forecast\nhigher precision to measure the intrinsic scatter including the value mention\nbefore. We conclude that this method can be used as an internal consistency\ncheck method on their simplifying assumptions and complementary to\ncross-calibration techniques in multi-wavelength cluster observations\n", "  Following the 2015 Planck release, we briefly comment on the status and some\nongoing opportunities in the interface between inflationary cosmology, string\ntheory, and CMB data. The constraints in the $r$-$n_s$ plane introduce a new\nparameter into inflationary cosmology relative to the simplest quadratic\ninflation model, in a direction which fits well with couplings to heavy fields\nas occurs in string theory. The precision of the data permits further searches\nfor and constraints on additional model-dependent features, such as oscillatory\n$N$-spectra, a program requiring specific theoretically motivated shapes. Since\nthe perturbations can easily be affected by additional sectors and couplings,\nnull results can usefully bound such contributions. We also review the broader\nlessons string theory has contributed to our understanding of primordial\ninflation, and close with some approaches to a more complete framework.\nPublished in a special volume of Comptes Rendus on Inflation: Theoretical and\nObservational Status.\n", "  Fathoming interplay between symmetry and topology of many-electron\nwave-functions has deepened understanding of quantum many body systems,\nespecially after the discovery of topological insulators. Topology of electron\nwave-functions enforces and protects emergent gapless excitations, and symmetry\nis intrinsically tied to the topological protection in a certain class. Namely,\nunless the symmetry is broken, the topological nature is intact. We show novel\ninterplay phenomena between symmetry and topology in topological phase\ntransitions associated with line-nodal superconductors. The interplay may\ninduce an exotic universality class in sharp contrast to that of the\nphenomenological Landau-Ginzburg theory. Hyper-scaling violation and emergent\nrelativistic scaling are main characteristics, and the interplay even induces\nunusually large quantum critical region. We propose characteristic experimental\nsignatures around the phase transitions in three spatial dimensions, for\nexample, a linear phase boundary in a temperature-tuning parameter\nphase-diagram.\n", "  V1184 Tau is a young variable for long time monitored at optical wavelengths.\nIts variability has been ascribed to a sudden and repetitive increase of the\ncircumstellar extinction (UXor-type variable), but the physical origin of such\nvariation, although hypothesized, has not been fully supported on observational\nbasis. To get a new insight into the variability of V1184 Tau, we present new\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations taken in the period 2008-2015.\nDuring these years the source has reached the same high brightness level that\nhad before the remarkable fading of about 5 mag undergone in 2004. The optical\nspectrum is the first obtained when the continuum is at its maximum level. The\nobservations are interpreted in the framework of extinction driven variability.\nWe analyze light curves, optical and near-infrared colors, SED and optical\nspectrum. The emerging picture indicates that the source fading is due to an\nextinction increase of DeltaA_V about 5 mag, associated with a strong infrared\nexcess, attributable to a thermal component at T=1000 K. From the flux of\nH(alpha) we derive a mass accretion rate between 10^-11 -5 10^-10 M_sun yr^-1\ns, consistent with that of classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. The source\nSED was fitted for both the high and low level of brightness. A scenario\nconsistent with the known stellar properties (such as spectral type, mass and\nradius) is obtained only if the distance to the source is of few hundreds of\nparsecs, in contrast with the commonly assumed value of 1.5 kpc. Our analysis\npartially supports that presented by Grinin (2009), according to which the\ncircumstellar disk undergoes a periodical puffing, whose observational effects\nare both to shield the central star and to evidence a disk wind activity.\nHowever, since the mass accretion rate remains almost constant with time, the\nsource is likely not subject to accretion bursts.\n", "  We demonstrate that four top-quark production is a powerful tool to constrain\nthe top Yukawa coupling. The constraint is robust in the sense that it does not\nrely on the Higgs boson decay. Taking into account the projection of the\n$t\\bar{t}H$ production by the ATLAS collaobration, we obtain a bound on Higgs\nboson width, $\\Gamma_H\\leq 3.1~\\Gamma_H^{\\rm SM}$, at the 14 TeV LHC with an\nintegrated luminosity of $300~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$. Increasing the luminosity to\n$500~{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ yields $\\Gamma_H\\leq 2.1~\\Gamma_H^{\\rm SM}$.\n", "  The Draco nebula is a high Galactic latitude interstellar cloud likely to\nhave been formed by the collision of a Galactic halo cloud entering the disk of\nthe Milky Way. Such conditions are ideal to study the formation of cold and\ndense gas in colliding flows of warm gas. We present Herschel-SPIRE\nobservations that reveal the fragmented structure of the interface between the\ninfalling cloud and the Galactic layer. This front is characterized by a\nRayleigh-Taylor instability structure. From the determination of the typical\nlength of the periodic structure (2.2 pc) we estimated the gas kinematic\nviscosity and the turbulence dissipation scale (0.1 pc) that is compatible with\nthat expected if ambipolar diffusion is the main mechanism of energy\ndissipation in the WNM. The small-scale structures of the nebula are typical of\nthat seen in some molecular clouds. The gas density has a log-normal\ndistribution with an average value of $10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. The size of the\nstructures is 0.1-0.2 pc but this estimate is limited by the resolution of the\nobservations. The mass ranges from 0.2 to 20 M$_{\\odot}$ and the distribution\nof the more massive clumps follows a power law $dN/d\\log(M) \\sim M^{-1.4}$. We\nidentify a mass-size relation with the same exponent as that found in GMCs\n($M\\sim L^{2.3}$) but only 15% of the mass of the cloud is in gravitationally\nbound structures. We conclude that the increase of pressure in the collision is\nstrong enough to trigger the WNM-CNM transition caused by the interplay between\nturbulence and thermal instability as self-gravity is not dominating the\ndynamics.\n", "  We investigated the magnetic ground state and low-energy excitations of the\nspin chains compounds SrCuO$_{2}$ (zigzag chains) and Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$ (linear\nchains) in the presence of quantum impurities induced by lightly doping ($\\leq\n1 \\%$) with Zn$^{2+}$ ($S = 0$), Co$^{2+}$ ($S =1/2$) and Ni$^{2+}$ ($S = 1$)\nimpurities at the Cu$^{2+}$ site. We show that the ground states and the nature\nof low-lying excitations (i.e., gapped or gapless) depend on the spin state and\nsymmetry of the defects. For Ni doped chains a spin gap is observed but for Zn\nand Co doping the excitations remain gapless. Co-doped chains exhibit magnetic\norder with critical temperatures significantly enhanced compared to those of\nthe pristine compounds. In the specific case of 1 \\% Co impurities, the linear\nchains exhibit long-range order below 11 K, while the zigzag chain is\ncharacterized by a quasi-long range ordered phase below 6 K with correlation\nlengths of about 12\\textit{a} and 40\\textit{c} units along the crystal axes\n\\textit{a} and \\textit{c}, respectively. The different magnetic behaviours of\nthese two compounds with comparable intra- and interchain couplings underpin\nthe role of spin frustration in the zigzag chains.\n", "  We present several models where the QCD axion arises accidentally. Confining\ngauge theories can generate axion candidates whose properties are uniquely\ndetermined by the quantum numbers of the new fermions under the Standard Model.\nThe Peccei-Quinn symmetry can emerge accidentally if the gauge theory is\nchiral. We generalise previous constructions in a unified framework. In some\ncases these models can be understood as the deconstruction of 5-dimensional\ngauge theories where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is protected by locality but\nmore general constructions are possible.\n", "  The predictions of Standard Model Higgs inflation are in excellent agreement\nwith the Planck data, without the need for new fields. However, consistency of\nthe theory requires the presence of (unknown) threshold corrections. These\nmodify the running of the couplings, and thereby change the shape of the\ninflationary potential. This raises the question how sensitive the CMB\nparameters are to the UV completion. We show that, due to a precise\ncancellation, the inflationary predictions are almost unaffected. This implies\nin general that one cannot relate the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio\nto the precise top and Higgs mass measurements at the LHC, nor can one probe\neffects of UV physics on the running.\n", "  In this paper, we study the cosmic constraint to $w$CDM model via $118$\nstrong gravitational lensing systems which are complied from SLACS, BELLS, LSD\nand SL2S surveys, where the ratio between two angular diameter distances\n$D^{obs} = D_A(z_l,z_s)/D_A(0,z_s)$ is taken as a cosmic observable. To obtain\nthis ratio, we adopt two strong lensing models: one is the singular isothermal\nsphere model (SIS), the other one is the power-law density profile (PLP) model.\nVia the Markov Chain Mote Carlo method, the posterior distribution of the\ncosmological model parameters space is obtained. The results show that the\ncosmological model parameters are not sensitive to the parameterized forms of\nthe power-law index $\\gamma$. Furthermore, the PLP model gives a relative\ntighter constraint to the cosmological parameters than that of the SIS model.\nThe predicted value of $\\Omega_m=0.31^{+0.44}_{-0.24}$ by SIS model is\ncompatible with that obtained by {\\it Planck}2015: $\\Omega_{m}=0.313\\pm0.013$.\nHowever, the value of $\\Omega_m=0.15^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ based on the PLP model is\nsmaller and has $1.25\\sigma$ tension with that obtained by {\\it Planck}2015\nresult. This discrepancy maybe come from the systematic errors.\n", "  The precision of concentration sensing is improved when cells communicate.\nHere we derive the physical limits to concentration sensing for cells that\ncommunicate over short distances by directly exchanging small molecules\n(juxtacrine signaling), or over longer distances by secreting and sensing a\ndiffusive messenger molecule (autocrine signaling). In the latter case, we find\nthat the optimal cell spacing can be large, due to a tradeoff between\nmaintaining communication strength and reducing signal cross-correlations. This\nleads to the surprising result that autocrine signaling allows more precise\nsensing than juxtacrine signaling for sufficiently large populations. We\ncompare our results to data from a wide variety of communicating cell types.\n", "  The experimental study of gravity became much more active in the late 1950s,\na change pronounced enough be termed the birth, or naissance, of experimental\ngravity physics. I present a review of developments in this subject since 1915,\nthrough the broad range of new approaches that commenced in the late 1950s, and\nup to the transition of experimental gravity physics to what might be termed a\nnormal and accepted part of physical science in the late 1960s. This review\nshows the importance of advances in technology, here as in all branches of\nnatural science. The role of contingency is illustrated by Robert Dicke's\ndecision in the mid-1950s to change directions in mid-career, to lead a\nresearch group dedicated to the experimental study of gravity. The review also\nshows the power of nonempirical evidence. Some in the 1950s felt that general\nrelativity theory is so logically sound as to be scarcely worth the testing.\nBut Dicke and others argued that a poorly tested theory is only that, and that\nother nonempirical arguments, based on Mach's Principle and Dirac's Large\nNumbers hypothesis, suggested it would be worth looking for a better theory of\ngravity. I conclude by offering lessons from this history, some peculiar to the\nstudy of gravity physics during the naissance, some of more general relevance.\nThe central lesson, which is familiar but not always well advertised, is that\nphysical theories can be empirically established, sometimes with surprising\nresults.\n", "  X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) are characterized by Planckian\nspectra in X-ray bands, but show optical/ultraviolet(UV) excesses which are the\nmeasured photometry exceeding that is extrapolated from X-ray spectra. To solve\nthis problem, a radiative model of bremsstrahlung emission from a plasma\natmosphere is established in the regime of strangeon star. A strangeon star\natmosphere could simply be regarded as the upper layer of a normal neutron\nstar. This plasma atmosphere, formed and maintained by the ISM-accreted matter\ndue to the so-called strangeness barrier, is supposed to be of two-temperature.\nAll the seven XDINS spectra could be well fitted by the radiative model, from\noptical/UV to X-ray bands. The fitted radiation radii of XDINSs are from 7 to\n13km, while the modelled electron temperatures are between 50 and 250eV, except\nRX J0806.4-4123 with a radiation radius ~3.5km, indicating that this source\ncould be a low-mass strangeon star candidate. This strangeon star model could\nfurther be tested by soft X-ray polarimetry, such as the Lightweight Asymmetry\nand Magnetism Probe which is expected to work on Chinese space station around\n2020.\n", "  The coupled evolution of pulsar rotation and inclination angle in the wind\nbraking model is calculated. The oblique pulsar tends to align. The pulsar\nalignment will affect its spin-down behavior. As a pulsar evolves from the\nmagneto-dipole radiation dominated case to the particle wind dominated case,\nthe braking index will first increase and then decrease. In the early time, the\nbraking index may be larger than 3. And during the following long time, the\nbraking index will be always smaller than 3. The minimum braking index is about\none. This can explain the existence of high braking index larger than 3, and\nlow braking index of pulsars simultaneously. The pulsar braking index is\nexpected to evolve from larger than three to about one. A general trend is that\nthe pulsar braking index will evolve from the Crab-like case to the Vela-like\ncase.\n", "  Dynamical decoupling techniques are the method of choice for increasing gate\nfidelities. While these methods have produced very impressive results in terms\nof decreasing local noise and increasing the fidelities of single qubit\noperations, dealing with the noise of two qubit gates has proven more\nchallenging. The main obstacle is that the noise time scale is shorter than the\ntwo qubit gate itself so that refocusing methods do not work. We present a\nmeasurement and feedback based method to refocus two qubit gates which cannot\nbe refocused by conventional methods. We analyze in detail this method for an\nerror model which is relevant for trapped ions quantum information.\n", "  We study inflation for a quantum scalar electrodynamics model in curved\nspace-time and for higher-derivative quantum gravity (QG) coupled with scalar\nelectrodynamics. The corresponding renormalization-group (RG) improved\npotential is evaluated for both theories in Jordan frame where non-minimal\nscalar-gravitational coupling sector is explicitly kept. The role of one-loop\nquantum corrections is investigated by showing how these corrections enter in\nthe expressions for the slow-roll parameters, the spectral index and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and how they influence the bound of the Hubble parameter\nat the beginning of the primordial acceleration. We demonstrate that the viable\ninflation maybe successfully realized, so that it turns out to be consistent\nwith last Planck and BICEP2/Keck Array data.\n", "  Recent high-precision results for the critical exponent of the localization\nlength at the integer quantum Hall (IQH) transition differ considerably between\nexperimental ($\\nu_\\text{exp} \\approx 2.38$) and numerical ($\\nu_\\text{CC}\n\\approx 2.6$) values obtained in simulations of the Chalker-Coddington (CC)\nnetwork model. We revisit the arguments leading to the CC model and consider a\nmore general network with geometric (structural) disorder. Numerical\nsimulations of this new model lead to the value $\\nu \\approx 2.37$ in very\nclose agreement with experiments. We argue that in a continuum limit the\ngeometrically disordered model maps to the free Dirac fermion coupled to\nvarious random potentials (similar to the CC model) but also to quenched\ntwo-dimensional quantum gravity. This explains the possible reason for the\nconsiderable difference between critical exponents for the CC model and the\ngeometrically disordered model and may shed more light on the analytical theory\nof the IQH transition. We extend our results to network models in other\nsymmetry classes.\n", "  We analyze the physical properties and dynamical origin of a curved jet of\ncomet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that was observed repeatedly in several nucleus\nrotations starting on May 30 and persisting until early August, 2015. We\nsimulated the motion of dust grains ejected from the nucleus surface under the\ninfluence of the gravity and viscous drag effect of the expanding gas flow from\nthe rotating nucleus. The formation of the curved jet is a combination of the\nsize of the dust particles (~0.1-1 mm) and the location of the source region\nnear the nucleus equator. This enhances the spiral feature of the collimated\ndust stream after the dust is accelerated to a terminal speed on the order of\nm/s.\n", "  We use quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics to study an\nazimuthally-symmetric boost-invariant quark-gluon plasma including the effects\nof both shear and bulk viscosities. In quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics,\na single finite-temperature quasiparticle mass is introduced and fit to the\nlattice data in order to implement a realistic equation of state. We compare\nresults obtained using the quasiparticle method with the standard method of\nimposing the equation of state in anisotropic hydrodynamics and viscous\nhydrodynamics. Using these three methods, we extract the primordial particle\nspectra, total number of charged particles, and average transverse momentum for\nvarious values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s. We find\nthat the three methods agree well for small shear viscosity to entropy density\nratio, eta/s, but differ at large eta/s. We find, in particular, that when\nusing standard viscous hydrodynamics, the bulk-viscous correction can drive the\nprimordial particle spectra negative at large p_T which is clearly unphysical.\nSuch a behavior is not seen in either anisotropic hydrodynamics approach,\nirrespective of the value of eta/s.\n", "  Stimulated by experimental advances in electrolyte gating methods, we\ninvestigate theoretically percolation in thin films of inhomogenous complex\noxides, such as La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO$_{3}$ (LSCO), induced by a combination of\nbulk chemical and surface electrostatic doping. Using numerical and analytical\nmethods, we identify two mechanisms that describe how bulk dopants reduce the\namount of electrostatic surface charge required to reach percolation: (i)\nbulk-assisted surface percolation, and (ii) surface-assisted bulk percolation.\nWe show that the critical surface charge strongly depends on the film thickness\nwhen the film is close to the chemical percolation threshold. In particular,\nthin films can be driven across the percolation transition by modest surface\ncharge densities \\emph{via} surface-assisted bulk percolation. If percolation\nis associated with the onset of ferromagnetism, as in LSCO, we further\ndemonstrate that the presence of critical magnetic clusters extending from the\nfilm surface into the bulk results in considerable volume enhancement of the\nsaturation magnetization, with pronounced experimental consequences. These\nresults should significantly guide experimental work seeking to verify\ngate-induced percolation transitions in such materials.\n", "  Saturable absorption is a non-perturbative nonlinear optical phenomenon that\nplays a pivotal role in the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Here we show\nthat this effect emerges in graphene at unprecedentedly low light intensities,\nthus opening avenues to new nonlinear physics and applications in optical\ntechnology. Specifically, we theoretically investigate saturable absorption in\nextended graphene by developing a non-perturbative single-particle approach,\ndescribing conduction-electron dynamics in the atomically-thin material using\nthe two-dimensional Dirac equation for massless Dirac fermions, which is recast\nin the form of generalized Bloch equations. By solving the electron dynamics\nnon-perturbatively, we account for both interband and intraband contributions\nto the intensity-dependent saturated conductivity and conclude that the former\ndominates regardless of the intrinsic doping state of the material. The results\nare in excellent agreement with atomistic quantum-mechanical simulations\nincluding higher-band effects. Additionally, we find that the modulation depth\nof saturable absorption in graphene can be electrically manipulated through an\nexternally applied gate voltage. Our results are relevant for the development\nof graphene-based optoelectronic devices, as well as for applications in\nmode-locking and random lasers.\n", "  The kinetic glass transition in short-range attractive colloids is\ntheoretically studied by time-convolutionless mode-coupling theory (TMCT). By\nnumerical calculations, TMCT is shown to recover all the remarkable features\npredicted by the mode-coupling theory for attractive colloids, namely the\nglass-liquid-glass reentrant, the glass-glass transition, and the higher-order\nsingularities. It is also demonstrated through the comparisons with the results\nof molecular dynamics for the binary attractive colloids that TMCT improves the\ncritical values of the volume fraction. In addition, a schematic model of three\ncontrol parameters is investigated analytically. It is thus confirmed that TMCT\ncan describe the glass-glass transition and higher-order singularities even in\nsuch a schematic model.\n", "  We examine the long-term behaviour of non-integrable, energy-conserved, 1D\nsystems of macroscopic grains interacting via a contact-only generalized Hertz\npotential and held between stationary walls. Existing dynamical studies showed\nthe absence of energy equipartitioning in such systems, hence their long-term\ndynamics was described as quasi-equilibrium. Here we show that these systems do\nin fact reach thermal equilibrium at sufficiently long times, as indicated by\nthe calculated heat capacity. As a byproduct, we show how fluctuations of\nsystem quantities, and thus the distribution functions, are influenced by the\nHertz potential. In particular, the variance of the system's kinetic energy\nprobability density function is reduced by a factor related to the contact\npotential.\n", "  Ion cyclotron emission (ICE) offers unique promise as a diagnostic of the\nfusion born alpha-particle population in magnetically confined plasmas.\nPioneering observations from JET and TFTR found that ICE intensity $P_{ICE}$\nscales approximately linearly with the measured neutron flux from fusion\nreactions, and with the inferred concentration, $n_\\alpha/n_i$, of fusion-born\nalpha-particles confined within the plasma. We present fully nonlinear\nself-consistent kinetic simulations that reproduce this scaling for the first\ntime. This resolves a longstanding question in the physics of fusion\nalpha-particle confinement and stability in MCF plasmas. It confirms the\nmagnetoacoustic cyclotron instability (MCI) as the likely emission mechanism\nand greatly strengthens the basis for diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future\nburning plasmas.\n", "  In the proximity of the QCD critical point the bulk viscosity of quark-gluon\nmatter is expected to be proportional to nearly the third power of the critical\ncorrelation length, and become significantly enhanced. This work is the first\nattempt to study the phenomenological consequences of enhanced bulk viscosity\nnear the QCD critical point. For this purpose, we implement the expected\ncritical behavior of the bulk viscosity within a non-boost-invariant,\nlongitudinally expanding $1+1$ dimensional causal relativistic hydrodynamical\nevolution at non-zero baryon density. We demonstrate that the\ncritically-enhanced bulk viscosity induces a substantial non-equilibrium\npressure, effectively softening the equation of state, and leads to sizable\neffects in the flow velocity and single particle distributions at the\nfreeze-out. The observable effects that may arise due to the enhanced bulk\nviscosity in the vicinity of the QCD critical point can be used as\ncomplimentary information to facilitate searches for the QCD critical point.\n", "  In this work we provide for a description of the low-energy physics of\ninteracting multi-species fermions in terms of the bound-states that are\nstabilized in these systems when a spin gap opens. We argue that, at energies\nmuch smaller than the spin gap, these systems are described by a Luttinger\nliquid of bound-states that depends, on top of the charge stiffness $\\nu$ and\nthe charge velocity $u$, on a \"Fermi\" momentum $P_F$ satisfying $qP_F = Nk_F$\nwhere $q$ is the charge of the bound-state, $N$ the number of species and $k_F$\nis the Fermi momentum in the non-interacting limit. We further argue that for\ngeneric interactions, generic bound-states are likely to be stabilized. They\nare associated with emergent, in general non-local, symmetries and are in the\nnumber of five. The first two consist of either a charge $q=N$ local $SU(N)$\nsinglet or a charge $q=N$ bound-state made of two local $SU(p)$ and $SU(N-p)$\nsinglets. In this case the Fermi momentum $P_F=k_F$ is preserved. The three\nothers have an enhanced Fermi vector $P_F$. The latter are either charge $q=2$\nbosonic p-wave and s-wave pairs with $SO(N)$ and $SP(N)$ symmetry and\n$P_F=Nk_F/2$ or a composite fermion of charge $q=1$ with $P_F=Nk_F$. The\ninstabilities of these Luttinger liquid states towards incompressible phases\nand their possible topological nature are also discussed.\n", "  The debate about whether the insulating phases of vanadium dioxide (VO2) can\nbe described by band theory or must be described by a theory of strong electron\ncorrelations remains unresolved even after decades of research. Energy-band\ncalculations using hybrid exchange functionals or including self-energy\ncorrections account for the insulating or metallic nature of different phases,\nbut have not yet successfully accounted for the observed magnetic orderings.\nStrongly-correlated theories have had limited quantitative success. Here we\nreport that, by using hard pseudopotentials and an optimized hybrid exchange\nfunctional, the energy gaps and magnetic orderings of both monoclinic VO2\nphases and the metallic nature of the high-temperature rutile phase are\nconsistent with available experimental data, obviating an explicit role for\nstrong correlations. We also report a potential candidate for the newly-found\nmetallic monoclinic phase and present a detailed magnetic structure of the M2\nmonoclinic phase.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum dots can emit antibunched, single photons on demand\nwith narrow linewidths. However, the observed linewidths are broader than\nlifetime measurements predict, due to spin and charge noise in the environment.\nThis noise randomly shifts the transition energy and destroys coherence and\nindistinguishability of the emitted photons. Fortunately, the fluctuations can\nbe reduced by a stabilization using a suitable feedback loop. In this work we\ndemonstrate a fast feedback loop that manifests itself in a strong hysteresis\nand bistability of the exciton resonance fluorescence signal. Field ionization\nof photogenerated quantum dot excitons leads to the formation of a charged\ninterface layer that drags the emission line along over a frequency range of\nmore than 30 GHz. This internal charge-driven feedback loop could be used to\nreduce the spectral diffusion and stabilize the emission frequency within\nmilliseconds, presently only limited by the sample structure, but already\nfaster than nuclear spin feedback.\n", "  In atoms spin-orbit coupling (SOC) cannot raise the angular momentum above a\nmaximum value or lower it below a minimum. Here we show that this need not be\nthe case in materials built from nanoscale structures including multi-nuclear\ncoordination complexes, materials with decorated lattices, or atoms on\nsurfaces. In such cyclic molecules the electronic spin couples to currents\nrunning around the molecule. For odd-fold symmetric molecules (e.g., odd\nmembered rings) the SOC is highly analogous to the atomic case; but for\neven-fold symmetric molecules every angular momentum state can be both raised\nand lowered. These differences arise because for odd-fold symmetric molecules\nthe maximum and minimum molecular orbital angular momentum states are time\nreversal conjugates, whereas for even-fold symmetric molecules they are aliases\nof the same single state. We show, from first principles calculations, that in\nsuitable molecules this molecular SOC is large, compared to the energy\ndifferences between frontier molecular orbitals. Finally, we show that, when\nelectronic correlations are strong, molecular SOC can cause highly anisotropic\nexchange interactions and discuss how this can lead to effective spin models\nwith compass Hamiltonians.\n", "  Helical intergalactic magnetic fields at the $\\sim 10^{-14}~{\\rm G}$ level on\n$\\sim 10~{\\rm Mpc}$ length scales are indicated by current gamma ray\nobservations. The existence of magnetic fields in cosmic voids and their\nnon-trivial helicity suggest that they must have originated in the early\nuniverse and thus have implications for the fundamental interactions. I combine\npresent knowledge of the observational constraints and the dynamics of\ncosmological magnetic fields to derive characteristics that would need to be\nexplained by the magnetic field generation mechanism. The importance of CP\nviolation and a possible crucial role for chiral effects in the early universe\nare pointed out.\n", "  Measurements of the London penetration depth and tunneling conductance in\nsingle crystals of the recently discovered stoicheometric, iron - based\nsuperconductor, CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ (CaK1144) show nodeless, two effective gap\nsuperconductivity with a larger gap of about 6-9 meV and a smaller gap of about\n1-4 meV. Having a critical temperature, $T_{c,onset}\\approx$35.8 K, this\nmaterial behaves similar to slightly overdoped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)Fe$_2$As$_2$\n(e.g. $x=$0.54, $T_c \\approx$ 34 K)---a known multigap $s_{\\pm}$\nsuperconductor. We conclude that the superconducting behavior of stoichiometric\nCaK1144 demonstrates that two-gap $s_{\\pm}$ superconductivity is an essential\nproperty of high temperature superconductivity in iron - based superconductors,\nindependent of the degree of substitutional disorder.\n", "  We introduce the ALMA Redshift 4 Survey (AR4S), a systematic ALMA survey of\nall the known galaxies with stellar mass (M*) larger than 5e10 Msun at 3.5<z<5\nin the GOODS--south, UDS and COSMOS CANDELS fields. The sample we have analyzed\nin this paper is composed of 96 galaxies observed with ALMA at 890um (180um\nrest-frame) with an on-source integration time of 1.3 min per galaxy. We\ndetected 32% of the sample at more than 3 sigma significance. Using the stacked\nALMA and Herschel photometry, we derived an average dust temperature of 40+/-2\nK for the whole sample, and extrapolate the Lir and SFR for all our galaxies\nbased on their ALMA flux. We then used a forward modeling approach to estimate\ntheir intrinsic sSFR distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and\nselection effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and M*, with a median\nsSFR=2.8+/-0.8 Gyr and a dispersion around that relation of 0.28+/-0.13 dex.\nThis latter value is consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is\nproof that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in place at\nz=4, at least among massive galaxies. These new constraints on the properties\nof the main sequence are in good agreement with the latest predictions from\nnumerical simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in galaxies\nis driven by the same mechanism from z=4 to the present day, that is, over at\nleast 90% of the cosmic history. We also discuss the consequences of our\nresults on the population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a\nseries that will employ these new ALMA observations to explore the star\nformation and dust properties of the massive end of the z=4 galaxy population.\n", "  Teleportation of an entangled state, known as entanglement swapping, plays an\nessential role in quantum communication and network.Here we report a field-test\nentanglement swapping experiment with two independent telecommunication band\nentangled photon-pair sources over the optical fibre network of Hefei city. The\ntwo sources are located at two nodes 12 km apart and the Bell-state measurement\nis performed in a third location which is connected to the two source nodes\nwith 14.7 km and 10.6 km optical fibres. An average visibility of 79.9+/-4.8%\nis observed in our experiment, which is high enough to infer a violation of\nBell inequality. With the entanglement swapping setup, we demonstrate a source\nindependent quantum key distribution, which is also immune to any attack\nagainst detection in the measurement site.\n", "  Accelerated charges radiate, and therefore must lose energy. The impact of\nthis energy loss on particle motion, called radiation reaction, becomes\nsignificant in intense-laser matter interactions, where it can reduce collision\nenergies, hinder particle acceleration schemes, and is seemingly unavoidable.\nHere we show that this common belief breaks down in short laser pulses, and\nthat energy losses and radiation reaction can be controlled and effectively\nswitched off by appropriate tuning of the pulse length. This \"quenching\" of\nemission is impossible in classical physics, but becomes possible in QED due to\nthe discrete nature of quantum emissions.\n", "  Very massive stars in the final phases of their lives often show\nunpredictable outbursts that can mimic supernovae, so-called, \"SN impostors\",\nbut the distinction is not always straigthforward. Here we present observations\nof a luminous blue variable (LBV) in NGC 2770 in outburst over more than 20\nyears that experienced a possible terminal explosion as type IIn SN in 2015,\nnamed SN 2015bh. This possible SN or \"main event\" was preceded by a precursor\npeaking $\\sim$ 40 days before maximum. The total energy release of the main\nevent is $\\sim$1.8$\\times$10$^{49}$ erg, which can be modeled by a $<$ 0.5\nM$_\\odot$ shell plunging into a dense CSM. All emission lines show a single\nnarrow P-Cygni profile during the LBV phase and a double P-Cygni profile post\nmaximum suggesting an association of this second component with the possible\nSN. Since 1994 the star has been redder than during a typical S-Dor like\noutburst. SN 2015bh lies within a spiral arm of NGC 2770 next to a number of\nsmall star-forming regions with a metallicity of $\\sim$ 0.5 solar and a stellar\npopulation age of 7-10 Myr. SN 2015bh shares many similarities with SN 2009ip,\nwhich, together with other examples may form a new class of objects that\nexhibit outbursts a few decades prior to \"hyper-eruption\" or final\ncore-collapse. If the star survives this event it is undoubtedly altered, and\nwe suggest that these \"zombie stars\" may evolve from an LBV to a Wolf Rayet\nstar over a very short timescale of only a few years. The final fate of these\ntypes of massive stars can only be determined with observations years after the\npossible SN.\n", "  Nowadays neutrino physics is undergoing a change of perspective: the\ndiscovery period is almost over and the phase of precise measurements is\nstarting. Despite the limited statistics collected for some variables, the\nthree--flavour oscillation neutrino framework is strengthening well. In this\nframework a new method has been developed to determine the neutrino mass\nordering, one of the still unknown and most relevant parameters. The method is\napplied to the 2015 results of the NOvA experiment for $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow\n\\nu_e$ appearance, including its systematic errors. A substantial gain in\nsignificance is obtained compared to the traditional $\\Delta\\chi^2$ approach.\nPerspectives are provided for future results obtainable by NOvA with larger\nexposures. Assuming the number of the 2015 $\\nu_e$ observed events scales with\nthe exposure, an increase in only a factor three would exclude the inverted\nhierarchy at more than 95\\% C.L. over the full range of the CP violating phase.\nThe preliminary 2016 NOvA measurement on \\numunue appearance has also been\nanalyzed.\n", "  Spatiotemporal disorder has been recently associated to the occurrence of\nanomalous nonergodic diffusion of molecular components in biological systems,\nbut the underlying microscopic mechanism is still unclear. We introduce a model\nin which a particle performs continuous Brownian motion with changes of\ndiffusion coefficients induced by transient molecular interactions with\ndiffusive binding partners. In spite of the exponential distribution of waiting\ntimes, the model shows subdiffusion and nonergodicity similar to the\nheavy-tailed continuous time random walk. The dependence of these properties on\nthe density of binding partners is analyzed and discussed. Our work provide an\nexperimentally-testable microscopic model to investigate the nature of\nnonergodicity in disordered media.\n", "  We present a new measurement of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect using\ndata from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Using 600 square degrees of overlapping sky area,\nwe evaluate the mean pairwise baryon momentum associated with the positions of\n50,000 bright galaxies in the BOSS DR11 Large Scale Structure catalog. A\nnon-zero signal arises from the large-scale motions of halos containing the\nsample galaxies. The data fits an analytical signal model well, with the\noptical depth to microwave photon scattering as a free parameter determining\nthe overall signal amplitude. We estimate the covariance matrix of the mean\npairwise momentum as a function of galaxy separation, using microwave sky\nsimulations, jackknife evaluation, and bootstrap estimates. The most\nconservative simulation-based errors give signal-to-noise estimates between 3.6\nand 4.1 for varying galaxy luminosity cuts. We discuss how the other error\ndeterminations can lead to higher signal-to-noise values, and consider the\nimpact of several possible systematic errors. Estimates of the optical depth\nfrom the average thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal at the sample galaxy\npositions are broadly consistent with those obtained from the mean pairwise\nmomentum signal.\n", "  Extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray jets occur frequently in magnetically open\ncoronal holes on the Sun, especially at high solar latitudes. Some of these\njets are observed by white-light coronagraphs as they propagate through the\nouter corona toward the inner heliosphere, and it has been proposed that they\ngive rise to microstreams and torsional Alfv\\'{e}n waves detected in situ in\nthe solar wind. To predict and understand the signatures of coronal-hole jets,\nwe have performed a detailed statistical analysis of such a jet simulated with\nan adaptively refined magnetohydrodynamics model. The results confirm the\ngeneration and persistence of three-dimensional, reconnectiondriven magnetic\nturbulence in the simulation. We calculate the spatial correlations of magnetic\nfluctuations within the jet and find that they agree best with the M\\\"{u}ller -\nBiskamp scaling model including intermittent current sheets of various sizes\ncoupled via hydrodynamic turbulent cascade. The anisotropy of the magnetic\nfluctuations and the spatial orientation of the current sheets are consistent\nwith an ensemble of nonlinear Alfv\\'{e}n waves. These properties also reflect\nthe overall collimated jet structure imposed by the geometry of the\nreconnecting magnetic field. A comparison with Ulysses observations shows that\nturbulence in the jet wake is in quantitative agreement with that in the fast\nsolar wind.\n", "  We report the discovery of a high mass-ratio planet $q=0.012$, i.e., 13 times\nhigher than the Jupiter/Sun ratio. The host mass is not presently measured but\ncan be determined or strongly constrained from adaptive optics imaging. The\nplanet was discovered in a small archival study of high-magnification events in\npure-survey microlensing data, which was unbiased by the presence of anomalies.\nThe fact that it was previously unnoticed may indicate that more such planets\nlie in archival data and could be discovered by similar systematic study. In\norder to understand the transition from predominantly survey+followup to\npredominately survey-only planet detections, we conduct the first analysis of\nthese detections in the observational $(s,q)$ plane. Here $s$ is projected\nseparation in units of the Einstein radius. We find some evidence that\nsurvey+followup is relatively more sensitive to planets near the Einstein ring,\nbut that there is no statistical difference in sensitivity by mass ratio.\n", "  IceTop is an air shower array located on the Antarctic ice sheet at the\ngeographic South Pole. IceTop can detect an astrophysical flux of neutrons from\nGalactic sources as an excess of cosmic ray air showers arriving from the\nsource direction. Neutrons are undeflected by the Galactic magnetic field and\ncan typically travel 10 ($E$ / PeV) pc before decay. Two searches are performed\nusing 4 years of the IceTop dataset to look for a statistically significant\nexcess of events with energies above 10 PeV ($10^{16}$ eV) arriving within a\nsmall solid angle. The all-sky search method covers from -90$^{\\circ}$ to\napproximately -50$^{\\circ}$ in declination. No significant excess is found. A\ntargeted search is also performed, looking for significant correlation with\ncandidate sources in different target sets. This search uses a higher energy\ncut (100 PeV) since most target objects lie beyond 1 kpc. The target sets\ninclude pulsars with confirmed TeV energy photon fluxes and high-mass X-ray\nbinaries. No significant correlation is found for any target set. Flux upper\nlimits are determined for both searches, which can constrain Galactic neutron\nsources and production scenarios.\n", "  Majorana fermion dynamics may arise at the edge of Kitaev wires or\nsuperconductors. Alternatively, it can be engineered by using trapped ions or\nultracold atoms in an optical lattice as quantum simulators. This motivates the\ntheoretical study of Majorana fermions confined to a finite volume, whose\nboundary conditions are characterized by self-adjoint extension parameters.\nWhile the boundary conditions for Dirac fermions in $(1+1)$-d are characterized\nby a 1-parameter family, $\\lambda = - \\lambda^*$, of self-adjoint extensions,\nfor Majorana fermions $\\lambda$ is restricted to $\\pm i$. Based on this result,\nwe compute the frequency spectrum of Majorana fermions confined to a 1-d\ninterval. The boundary conditions for Dirac fermions confined to a 3-d region\nof space are characterized by a 4-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions,\nwhich is reduced to two distinct 1-parameter families for Majorana fermions. We\nalso consider the problems related to the quantum mechanical interpretation of\nthe Majorana equation as a single-particle equation. Furthermore, the equation\nis related to a relativistic Schr\\\"odinger equation that does not suffer from\nthese problems.\n", "  The spectral shape of cosmic ray positrons and antiprotons has been\naccurately measured in the broad kinetic energy range 1-350 GeV. In the higher\npart of this range (E > 30 GeV) the e+ and pbar are both well described by\npower laws with spectral indices gamma[e+] = 2.77 +-0.02 and gamma[pbar] = 2.78\n+- 0.04 that are approximately equal to each other and to the spectral index of\nprotons.\n  In the same energy range the positron/antiproton flux ratio has the\napproximately constant value 2.04+-0.04, that is consistent with being equal to\nthe ratio e_/pbar calculated for the conventional mechanism of production,\nwhere the antiparticles are created as secondaries in the inelastic\ninteractions of primary cosmic rays with interstellar gas.\n  The positron/antiproton ratio at lower energy is significantly higher\n(reaching the approximate value e+/pbar = 100 for E around 1 GeV), but in the\nentire energy range 1-350 GeV, the flux ratio is consistent with being equal to\nratio of the production rates in the conventional mechanism, as the production\nof low energy antiprotons is kinematically suppressed in collisions with a\ntarget at rest.\n  These results strongly suggest that cosmic ray positrons and antiprotons have\na common origin as secondaries in hadronic interactions. This conclusion has\nbroad implications for the astrophysics of cosmic rays in the Galaxy.\n", "  Systems of mobile physical entities exchanging information with their\nneighborhood can be found in many different situations. The understanding of\ntheir emergent cooperative behaviour has become an important issue across\ndisciplines, requiring a general conceptual framework in order to harvest the\npotential of these systems. We study the synchronization of coupled oscillators\nin time-evolving networks defined by the positions of self-propelled agents\ninteracting in real space. In order to understand the impact of mobility in the\nsynchronization process on general grounds, we introduce a simple model of\nself-propelled hard disks performing persistent random walks in 2$d$ space and\ncarrying an internal Kuramoto phase oscillator. For non-interacting particles,\nself-propulsion accelerates synchronization. The competition between agent\nmobility and excluded volume interactions gives rise to a richer scenario,\nleading to an optimal self-propulsion speed. We identify two extreme dynamic\nregimes where synchronization can be understood from theoretical\nconsiderations. A systematic analysis of our model quantifies the departure\nfrom the latter ideal situations and characterizes the different mechanisms\nleading the evolution of the system. We show that the synchronization of\nlocally coupled mobile oscillators generically proceeds through coarsening\nverifying dynamic scaling and sharing strong similarities with the phase\nordering dynamics of the 2$d$ XY model following a quench. Our results shed\nlight into the generic mechanisms leading the synchronization of mobile agents,\nproviding a efficient way to understand more complex or specific situations\ninvolving time-dependent networks where synchronization, mobility and excluded\nvolume are at play.\n", "  We explore a new low-threshold direct-detection concept for dark matter,\nbased on the breaking of chemical bonds between atoms. This includes the\ndissociation of molecules and the creation of defects in a lattice. With\nthresholds of a few to 10's of eV, such an experiment could probe the nuclear\ncouplings of dark matter particles as light as a few MeV. We calculate the\nexpected rates for dark matter to break apart diatomic molecules, which we take\nas a case study for more general systems. We briefly mention ideas for how\nchemical-bond breaking might be detected in practice. We also discuss the\npossibility of detecting solar neutrinos, including pp neutrinos, with this\nexperimental concept. With an event rate of $\\mathcal{O}$(0.1/kg-year), large\nexposures are required, but measuring low-energy solar neutrinos would provide\na crucial test of the solar model.\n", "  We analyzed the occurrence rates of flares on stars of spectral types K, G,\nF, and A, observed by Kepler. We found that the histogram of occurrence\nfrequencies of stellar flares is systematically shifted towards a high-energy\ntail for A-type stars compared to stars of cooler spectral types. We\nextrapolated the fitted power laws towards flares with smaller energies\n(nanoflares) and made estimates for total energy flux to stellar atmospheres by\nflares. We found that for A-type stars the total energy flux density was at\nleast 4-times smaller than for G-stars. We speculate that this deficit in\nenergy supply may explain the lack of hot coronae on A-type stars. Our results\nindicate an importance of nanoflares for heating and formation of the solar\ncorona.\n", "  A new type of topological state in strongly corrected condensed matter\nsystems, heavy Weyl fermion state, has been found in a heavy fermion material\nCeRu$_4$Sn$_6$, which has no inversion symmetry. Both two different types of\nWeyl points, type I and II, can be found in the quasi-particle band structure\nobtained by the LDA+Guztwiller calculations, which can treat the strong\ncorrelation effects among the f-electrons from Cerium atoms. The surface\ncalculations indicate that the topologically protected Fermi arc states exist\non the (010) but not on the (001) surfaces.\n", "  A binary mixture of super-paramagnetic colloidal particles is confined\nbetween glass plates such that the large particles become fixed and provide a\ntwo-dimensional disordered matrix for the still mobile small particles, which\nform a fluid. By varying fluid and matrix area fractions and tuning the\ninteractions between the super-paramagnetic particles via an external magnetic\nfield, different regions of the state diagram are explored. The mobile\nparticles exhibit delocalized dynamics at small matrix area fractions and\nlocalised motion at high matrix area fractions, and the localization transition\nis rounded by the soft interactions [T. O. E. Skinner et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 111}, 128301 (2013)]. Expanding on previous work, we find the dynamics of\nthe tracers to be strongly heterogeneous and show that molecular dynamics\nsimulations of an ideal gas confined in a fixed matrix exhibit similar\nbehavior. The simulations show how these soft interactions make the dynamics\nmore heterogenous compared to the disordered Lorentz gas and lead to strong\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations.\n", "  We calculate the low-lying spectrum of the $^{16}$O nucleus using an\n$\\alpha$-cluster model which includes the important tetrahedral and square\nconfigurations. Our approach is motivated by the dynamics of $\\alpha$-particle\nscattering in the Skyrme model. We are able to replicate the large energy\nsplitting that is observed between states of identical spin but opposite\nparities, as well as introduce states that were previously not found in other\ncluster models, such as a $0^-$ state. We also provide a novel interpretation\nof the first excited state of $^{16}$O and make predictions for the energies of\n$6^-$ states that have yet to be observed experimentally.\n", "  In a recent work (Chattopadhyay, A. K. et al, Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 91},\n58003, 2010) based on food consumption statistics, we showed how a stochastic\nagent based model could represent the time variation of the income distribution\nstatistics in a developing economy, thereby defining an alternative\n\\enquote{poverty index} (PI) that largely agreed with poverty gap index data.\nThis PI used two variables, the probability density function of the income\nstatistics and a consumption deprivation (CD) function, representing the\nshortfall in the minimum consumption needed for survival. Since the time\ndependence of the CD function was introduced there through data extrapolation\nonly and not through an endogenous time dependent series, this model left\nunexplained how the minimum consumption needed for survival varies with time.\nThe present article overcomes these limitations and arrives at a new unified\ntheoretical structure through time varying consumption and income distributions\nwhere trade is only allowed when the income exceeds consumption deprivation\n(CD). Our results reveal that such CD-dynamics reduces the threshold level of\nconsumption of basic necessities, suggesting a possible dietary transition in\nterms of lower saturation level of food-grain consumption. The new poverty\nindex conforms to recently observed trends more closely than conventional\nmeasures of poverty and allows probabilistic prediction of PI for future times.\n", "  We report on the spin waves and crystal field excitations in single crystal\nLiFePO$_4$ by inelastic neutron scattering over a wide range of temperatures,\nbelow and above the antiferromagnetic transition of this system. In particular,\nwe find extra excitations below $T_N=50$ K that are nearly dispersionless and\nare most intense around magnetic zone centers. We show that these excitations\ncorrespond to transitions between thermally occupied excited states of\nFe$^{2+}$ due to splitting of the $S=2$ levels that arise from crystal field\nand spin-orbit interaction. These excitations are further amplified by the\nhighly distorted nature of the oxygen octahedron surrounding the iron atoms.\nAbove $T_N$, magnetic fluctuations are observed up to at least 720~K, with\nadditional excitation around 4 meV, likely caused by single-ion splittings\nthrough spin-orbit and crystal field interactions. The latter weakens slightly\nat 720~K compared to 100~K, which is consistent with calculated cross-sections\nusing a single-ion model. Our theoretical analysis, using the MF-RPA model,\nprovides both detailed spectra of the Fe $d-$ shell and estimates of the\naverage ordered magnetic moment and $T_N$. By applying the MF-RPA model to a\nnumber of existing spin-wave results from other Li$M$PO$_4$ ($M=$ Mn, Co, and\nNi), we are able to obtain reasonable predictions for the moment sizes and\ntransition temperatures.\n", "  Transverse mode coupling instability of a bunch with space charge and wake\nfield is considered within the frameworks of the boxcar model. Eigenfunctions\nof the bunch without wake are used as a basis for the solution of the equations\nwith the wake field included. A dispersion equation for constant wake is\npresented in the form of an infinite continued fraction and also as the\nrecursive relation with an arbitrary number of the basis functions. Realistic\nwake fields are considered as well including resistive wall, square, and\noscillating wakes. It is shown that the TMCI threshold of the negative wake\ngrows up in absolute value when the SC tune shift increases. Threshold of\npositive wake goes down at the increasing SC tune shift. The explanation is\ndeveloped by an analysis of the bunch spectrum.\n", "  Here we report a random lasing based sensor which shows pH sensitivity\nexceeding by 2-orders of magnitude that of a conventional fluorescence sensor.\nWe explain the sensing mechanism as related to gain modifications and lasing\nthreshold nonlinearities. A dispersive diffusive lasing theory matches well the\nexperimental results, and allow us to predict the optimal sensing conditions\nand a maximal sensitivity as large as 200 times that of an identical\nfluorescence-based sensor. The simplicity of operation and high sensitivity\nmake it promising for future biosensing applications.\n", "  Any possible Lorentz violation in the hadron sector must be tied to Lorentz\nviolation at the underlying quark level. The relationships between the theories\nat these two levels are studied using chiral perturbation theory. Starting from\na two-flavor quark theory that includes dimension-four Lorentz-violation\noperators, the effective Lagrangians are derived for both pions and nucleons,\nwith novel terms appearing in both sectors. Since the Lorentz violation\ncoefficients for nucleons and pions are all related to a single set of\nunderlying quark coefficients, it is possible to place approximate bounds on\npion Lorentz violation using only proton and neutron observations. The\nresulting bounds on four pion parameters are at the $10^{-23}$ level,\nrepresenting improvements of ten orders of magnitude.\n", "  We present the X-ray luminosity (L) versus dynamical mass (M) relation for 63\nnearby clusters in the HIFLUGCS. The luminosity measurements are obtained based\non ~1.3 Ms of clean XMM data and ROSAT pointed observations. The masses are\nestimated using optical spectroscopic redshifts of 13647 cluster galaxies in\ntotal. Given sufficient numbers of member galaxies in computing the dynamical\nmasses, the L-M relations agree between the disturbed and undisturbed clusters.\nThe cool-core clusters still dominate the scatter in the L-M relation even when\na core corrected X-ray luminosity is used, which indicates that the scatter\nmainly reflects the structure formation history of the clusters. As shown by\nthe clusters with a small number of redshifts, the dynamical masses can be\nunderestimated leading to a biased scaling relation. To investigate the\npotential of spectroscopic surveys to follow up high-redshift galaxy\nclusters/groups observed in X-ray surveys for the identifications and mass\ncalibrations, we carried out Monte-Carlo re-sampling of the cluster galaxy\nredshifts and calibrated the uncertainties of the redshift and dynamical mass\nestimates when only reduced numbers of galaxy redshifts per cluster are\navailable. The re-sampling considers the SPIDERS and 4MOST configurations,\ndesigned for the follow-up of the eROSITA clusters, and was carried out for\neach cluster at the actual cluster redshift as well as at z=0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and\n0.8. For following up very distant cluster/groups, we carried out the mass\ncalibration based on the re-sampling with only 10zs/cluster, and redshift\ncalibration based on the re-sampling with only 5zs/cluster and 10zs/cluster,\nrespectively. Our results demonstrate the power of combining upcoming X-ray and\noptical spectroscopic surveys for mass calibration. The scatter in the\ndynamical mass estimates for the clusters with at least ten members is within\n50%.\n", "  The measured (central) values of the Higgs and top quark masses indicate that\nthe Standard Model (SM) effective potential develops an instability at high\nfield values. The scale of this instability, determined as the Higgs field\nvalue at which the potential drops below the electroweak minimum, is about\n$10^{11}$ GeV. However, such a scale is unphysical as it is not gauge-invariant\nand suffers from a gauge-fixing uncertainty of up to two orders of magnitude.\nSubjecting our system, the SM, to several probes of the instability (adding\nhigher order operators to the potential; letting the vacuum decay through\ncritical bubbles; heating up the system to very high temperature; inflating it)\nand asking in each case physical questions, we are able to provide several\ngauge-invariant scales related with the Higgs potential instability.\n", "  Linear sweep and cyclic voltammetry techniques are important tools for\nelectrochemists and have a variety of applications in engineering. Voltammetry\nhas classically been treated with the Randles-Sevcik equation, which assumes an\nelectroneutral supported electrolyte. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive\nmathematical theory of voltammetry in electrochemical cells with unsupported\nelectrolytes and for other situations where diffuse charge effects play a role,\nand present analytical and simulated solutions of the time-dependent\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations with generalized Frumkin-Butler-Volmer\n(FBV) boundary conditions for a 1:1 electrolyte and a simple reaction. Using\nthese solutions, we construct theoretical and simulated currentvoltage curves\nfor liquid and solid thin films, membranes with fixed background charge, and\ncells with blocking electrodes. The full range of dimensionless parameters is\nconsidered, including the dimensionless Debye screening length (scaled to the\nelectrode separation), Damkohler number (ratio of characteristic diffusion and\nreaction times) and dimensionless sweep rate (scaled to the thermal voltage per\ndiffusion time). The analysis focuses on the coupling of Faradaic reactions and\ndiffuse charge dynamics, although capacitive charging of the electrical double\nlayers (EDL) is also studied, for early time transients at reactive electrodes\nand for non-reactive blocking electrodes. Our work highlights cases where\ndiffuse charge effects are important in the context of voltammetry, and\nillustrates which regimes can be approximated using simple analytical\nexpressions and which require more careful consideration.\n", "  High precision polarization measurements open new opportunities for the study\nof the magnetic field structure as traced by polarimetric measurements of the\ninterstellar dust emission. Polarization parameters suffer from bias in the\npresence of measurement noise. It is critical to take into account all the\ninformation available in the data in order to accurately derive these\nparameters. The goal of this paper is to characterize the bias on the\npolarization angle dispersion function that is used to study the spatial\ncoherence of the polarization angle. We characterize, for the first time, the\nbias on the conventional estimator of the polarization angle dispersion\nfunction (S hereafter) and show that it can be positive or negative depending\non the true value. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to explore\nthe impact of the noise properties of the polarization data, as well as the\nimpact of the distribution of the true polarization angles on the bias. We show\nthat in the case where the ellipticity of the noise in (Q, U) varies by less\nthan 10 percent, one can use simplified, diagonal approximation of the noise\ncovariance matrix. In other cases, the shape of the noise covariance matrix\nshould be taken into account in the estimation of S. We also study new\nestimators such as the dichotomic and the polynomial estimators. Though the\ndichotomic estimator cannot be directly used to estimate S, we show that, on\nthe one hand, it can serve as an indicator of the accuracy of the conventional\nestimator and, on the other hand, it can be used for deriving the polynomial\nestimator. We propose a method for determining the upper limit of the bias on\nthe conventional estimator of S. The method is applicable to any linear\npolarization data set for which the noise covariance matrices are known.\n", "  We have used the Spitzer Space Telescope in February 2016 to obtain high\ncadence, high signal-to-noise, 17-hour duration light curves of Neptune at 3.6\nand 4.5 $\\mu$m. The light curve duration was chosen to correspond to the\nrotation period of Neptune. Both light curves are slowly varying with time,\nwith full amplitudes of 1.1 mag at 3.6 $\\mu$m and 0.6 mag at 4.5 $\\mu$m. We\nhave also extracted sparsely sampled 18-hour light curves of Neptune at W1 (3.4\n$\\mu$m) and W2 (4.6 $\\mu$m) from the WISE/NEOWISE archive at six epochs in\n2010-2015. These light curves all show similar shapes and amplitudes compared\nto the Spitzer light curves but with considerable variation from epoch to\nepoch. These amplitudes are much larger than those observed with Kepler/K2 in\nthe visible (amplitude $\\sim$0.02 mag) or at 845 nm with the Hubble Space\nTelescope in 2015 and at 763 nm in 2016 (amplitude $\\sim$ 0.2 mag). We\ninterpret the Spitzer and WISE light curves as arising entirely from reflected\nsolar photons, from higher levels in Neptune's atmosphere than for K2. Methane\ngas is the dominant opacity source in Neptune's atmosphere, and methane\nabsorption bands are present in the HST 763, and 845 nm, WISE W1, and Spitzer\n3.6 $\\mu$m filters.\n", "  The Griffiths phase has been proposed to induce a stretched critical regime\nthat facilitates self-organizing of brain networks for optimal function. This\nphase stems from the intrinsic structural heterogeneity of brain networks, such\nas the hierarchical modular structure. In this work, we extend this concept to\nmodified hierarchical networks with small-world connections based on Hanoi\nnetworks. Through extensive simulations, we identify the role of an exponential\ndistribution of the inter-moduli connectivity probability across hierarchies\ndetermining the emergence of the Griffiths phase. Numerical results and the\ncomplementary spectral analysis on the relevant networks can be helpful for a\ndeeper understanding of the essential structural characteristics of finite\ndimensional networks to support the Griffiths phase.\n", "  We present the first study of the process $J/\\psi \\rightarrow\n\\gamma\\eta\\pi^{0}$ using $(223.7\\pm1.4)\\times10^{6}$ $J/\\psi$ events\naccumulated with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII facility. The branching\nfraction for $J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\gamma\\eta\\pi^{0}$ is measured to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\gamma\\eta\\pi^{0})\n=(2.14\\pm0.18(stat)\\pm0.25(syst))\\times10^{-5}$. With a Bayesian approach, the\nupper limits of the branching fractions $\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\gamma\na_{0}(980),a_0(980)\\rightarrow\\eta\\pi^0)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow\n\\gamma a_{2}(1320),a_2(1320)\\rightarrow\\eta\\pi^0)$ are determined to be\n$2.5\\times10^{-6}$ and $6.6\\times10^{-6}$ at the 95\\% confidence level,\nrespectively. All of these measurements are given for the first time.\n", "  Metal-insulator transition accompanied by charge-ordering has been widely\ninvestigated in quasi-one-dimensional conductors, including in particular\norganic charge-transfer solids. Among such materials the 1/4-filled band\ncharge-transfer solids are of strong interest, because of the commensurate\nnature of the charge-ordering in these systems. The period-four charge-order\npattern ...1100... here is accompanied by two distinct bond distortion\npatterns, giving rise to bond-charge-density waves (BCDW) of types 1 and 2.\nUsing quantum Monte Carlo methods, we determine the phase diagram within the\nextended Hubbard Hamiltonian that gives both types 1 and 2 BCDW in the\nthermodynamic limit. We further investigate the effect of electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon interactions on the amount of charge disproportionation. Our\nresults show that between these two bond patterns, one (BCDW2) in general\ncoexists with a large magnitude charge order, which is highly sensitive to\nelectron-phonon interactions, while the other (BCDW1) is characterized by weak\ncharge order. We discuss the relevance of our work to experiments on several\n1/4-filled conductors, focusing in particular on the materials (EDO-TTF)_2X and\n(DMEDO-TTF)_2X with large amplitude charge-order.\n", "  We present Kepler light curves and optical spectroscopy of twenty X-ray\nbright stars located in the Kepler field of view. The stars, spectral type FK,\nshow evidence for rapid rotation including chromospheric activity 100 times or\nmore above the Sun at maximum and flaring behavior in their light curves.\nEighteen of our objects appear to be (sub)giants and may belong to the class of\nFK Com variables, that is evolved rapidly spinning single stars with no\nexcretion disk and high levels of chromospheric activity. Such stars are rare\nand are likely the result of W UMa binary mergers, a process believed to\nproduce the FK Com class of variable and their descendants. The FK Com stage,\nincluding the presence of an excretion disk, is short-lived but leads to\nlonger-lived stages consisting of single, rapidly rotating evolved (sub)giants\nwith high levels of stellar activity.\n", "  We present the analysis of the emission line galaxies members of 46 low\nredshift (0.04 < z < 0.07) clusters observed by WINGS (WIde-field Nearby Galaxy\ncluster Survey, Fasano et al. 2006). Emission line galaxies were identified\nfollowing criteria that are meant to minimize biases against non-star forming\ngalaxies and classified employing diagnostic diagrams. We have examined the\nemission line properties and frequencies of star forming galaxies, transition\nobjects and active galactic nuclei (AGNs: LINERs and Seyferts), unclassified\ngalaxies with emission lines, and quiescent galaxies with no detectable line\nemission. A deficit of emission line galaxies in the cluster environment is\nindicated by both a lower frequency with respect to control samples, and by a\nsystematically lower Balmer emission line equivalent width and luminosity (up\nto one order of magnitude in equivalent width with respect to control samples\nfor transition objects) that implies a lower amount of ionised gas per unit\nmass and a lower star formation rate if the source is classified as Hii region.\nA sizable population of transition objects and of low-luminosity LINERs\n(approx. 10 - 20% of all emission line galaxies) is detected among WINGS\ncluster galaxies. With respect to Hii sources they are a factor of approx. 1.5\nmore frequent than (or at least as frequent as) in control samples. Transition\nobjects and LINERs in cluster are most affected in terms of line equivalent\nwidth by the environment and appear predominantly consistent with \"retired\"\ngalaxies. Shock heating can be a possible gas excitation mechanism able to\naccount for observed line ratios. Specific to the cluster environment, we\nsuggest interaction between atomic and molecular gas and the intracluster\nmedium as a possible physical cause of line-emitting shocks.\n", "  We examine the bolometric lightcurves of five Type II-P supernovae (SNe\n1998A, 2000cb, 2006V, 2006au and 2009E) which are thought to originate from\nblue supergiant progenitors using a new python package named SuperBoL. With\nthis code, we calculate SNe lightcurves using three different techniques common\nin the literature: the quasi-bolometric method, which integrates the observed\nphotometry, the direct integration method, which additionally corrects for\nunobserved flux in the UV and IR, and the bolometric correction method, which\nuses correlations between observed colors and V-band bolometric corrections. We\npresent here the lightcurves calculated by SuperBoL along with previously\npublished lightcurves, as well as peak luminosities and Ni-56 yields. We find\nthat the direct integration and bolometric correction lightcurves largely agree\nwith previously published lightcurves, but with what we believe to be more\nrobust error calculations, with $0.2 \\leq \\delta L_{bol}/L_{bol} \\leq 0.5$.\nPeak luminosities and Ni-56 masses are similarly comparable to previous work.\nSN 2000cb remains an unusual member of this sub-group, owing to the faster rise\nand flatter plateau than the other supernovae in the sample. Initial\ncomparisons with the NLTE atmosphere code PHOENIX show that the direct\nintegration technique re-produces the luminosity of a model supernova spectrum\nto ~5% when given synthetic photometry of the spectrum as input. Our code is\npublicly available. The ability to produce bolometric lightcurves from observed\nsets of broad-band light curves should be helpful in the interpretation of\nother types of supernovae, particularly those that are not well characterized,\nsuch as extremely luminous supernovae and faint fast objects.\n", "  We explore the origin and Yukawa interactions of the scalars with peculiar\nCP-properties which were recently found in a multi-Higgs model based on an\norder-4 CP symmetry. We relate the existence of such scalars to the enhanced\nfreedom of defining CP, even beyond the well-known generalized CP symmetries,\nwhich arises in models with several zero-charge scalar fields. We also show\nthat despite possessing exotic CP quantum numbers, these scalars do not have to\nbe inert: they can have CP-conserving Yukawa interactions provided the CP acts\non fermions by also mixing generations. This paper focuses on formal\naspects---exposed in a pedagogical manner---and includes a brief discussion of\npossible phenomenological consequences.\n", "  We demonstrate a scheme for in-plane initialization and readout of a single\nexciton spin in an InGaAs quantum dot (QD) coupled to a GaAs nanobeam\nwaveguide. The chiral coupling of the QD and the optical mode of the nanobeam\nenables spin initialization and readout fidelity approaching unity in magnetic\nfield $B=1$ T and $\\sim$0.9 without the field. We further show that this\nin-plane excitation scheme is independent of the incident excitation laser\npolarization and depends solely on the excitation direction. This scheme\nprovides a robust in-plane spin excitation basis for a photon-mediated spin\nnetwork for quantum information applications.\n", "  Like Hipparcos, Gaia is designed to give absolute parallaxes, independent of\nany astrophysical reference system. And indeed, Gaia's internal zero-point\nerror for parallaxes is likely to be smaller than any individual parallax\nerror. Nevertheless, due in part to mechanical issues of unknown origin, there\nare many astrophysical questions for which the parallax zero-point error\n$\\sigma(\\pi_0)$ will be the fundamentally limiting constraint. These include\nthe distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic Center. We show\nthat by using the photometric parallax estimates for RR Lyrae stars (RRL)\nwithin 8kpc, via the ultra-precise infrared period-luminosity relation, one can\nindependently determine a hyper-precise value for $\\pi_{0}$. Despite their\npaucity relative to bright quasars, we show that RRL are competitive due to\ntheir order-of-magnitude improved parallax precision for each individual object\nrelative to bright quasars. We show that this method is mathematically robust\nand well-approximated by analytic formulae over a wide range of relevant\ndistances.\n", "  Finite temperature effects have a pronounced impact on the transport\nproperties of solids. In magnetic systems, besides the scattering of conduction\nelectrons by impurities and phonons, an additional scattering source coming\nfrom the magnetic degrees of freedom must be taken into account. A\nfirst-principle scheme which treats all these scattering effects on equal\nfooting was recently suggested within the framework of the multiple scattering\nformalism. Employing the alloy analogy model treated by means of the CPA,\nthermal lattice vibrations and spin fluctuations are effectively taken into\naccount. In the present work the temperature dependence of the longitudinal\nresistivity and the anomalous Hall effect in the strongly correlated metal Gd\nis considered. The comparison with experiments demonstrates that the proposed\nnumerical scheme does provide an adequate description of the electronic\ntransport at finite temperatures.\n", "  We report the anisotropic magneto-transport measurement on a non-compound\nband semiconductor black phosphorus (BP) with magnetic field B up to 16 Tesla\napplied in both perpendicular and parallel to electric current I under\nhydrostatic pressures. The BP undergoes a topological Lifshitz transition from\nband semiconductor to a zero-gap Dirac semimetal state, characterized by a weak\nlocalization-weak antilocaliation transition at low magnetic fields and the\nemergence of a nontrivial Berry Phase of detected by SdH magneto-oscillations\nin magnetoresistance curves. In the transition region, we observe a\npressure-dependent negative MR only in the B//I configuration. This negative\nlongitudinal MR is attributed to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly (topological\nE$\\cdot$B term) in the presence of weak antilocalization corrections.\n", "  We develop a magnetic ribbon model for molecular cloud filaments. These\nresult from turbulent compression in a molecular cloud in which the background\nmagnetic field sets a preferred direction. We argue that this is a natural\nmodel for filaments and is based on the interplay between turbulence, strong\nmagnetic fields, and gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion, rather than\npure gravity and thermal pressure. An analytic model for the formation of\nmagnetic ribbons that is based on numerical simulations is used to derive a\nlateral width of a magnetic ribbon. This differs from the thickness along the\nmagnetic field direction, which is essentially the Jeans scale. We use our\nmodel to calculate a synthetic observed relation between apparent width in\nprojection versus observed column density. The relationship is relatively flat,\nsimilar to observations, and unlike the simple expectation based on a Jeans\nlength argument.\n", "  We propose a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) which has a viable\ndark matter (DM) candidate, as well as can explain the generation of tiny\nneutrino masses. The DM is an electroweak (EW) singlet scalar $S$, odd under an\nimposed exact $Z_2$ symmetry, interacting to SM through `Higgs-portal'\ncoupling, while all other particles are even under $Z_2$. The model also has an\nEW isospin $3/2$ scalar, $\\Delta$ and a pair of EW isospin vector, $\\Sigma$ and\n$\\bar{\\Sigma}$, responsible for generating tiny neutrino mass via the effective\ndimension seven operator. Thanks to the additional interactions with $\\Delta$,\nthe scalar singlet DM $S$ survives a large region of parameter space by relic\ndensity constraints from WMAP/PLANCK and direct search bounds from updated LUX\ndata. Constraints on the model from Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has also been\ndiscussed.\n", "  Observational constraints on the birth and early evolution of massive black\nholes (BHs) come from two extreme regimes. At high redshift, quasars signal the\nrapid growth of billion-solar-mass BHs and indicate that these objects began\nremarkably heavy and/or accreted mass at rates above the Eddington limit. At\nlow redshift, the smallest nuclear BHs known are found in dwarf galaxies and\nprovide the most concrete limits on the mass of BH seeds. Here we review\ncurrent observational work in these fields that together are critical for our\nunderstanding of the origin of massive BHs in the Universe.\n", "  We calculate the two-terminal current noise generated by a magnetic moment\ncoupled to a helical edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator. When the\nsystem is symmetric with respect to in-plane spin rotation, the noise is\ndominated by the Nyquist component even in the presence of a voltage bias $V$.\nThe corresponding noise spectrum $S(V,\\omega)$ is determined by a modified\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem with the differential conductance $G(V,\\omega)$\nin place of the linear one. The differential noise $\\partial S/ \\partial V$,\ncommonly measured in experiments, is strongly dependent on frequency on a small\nscale $\\tau_{K}^{-1}\\ll T$ set by the Korringa relaxation rate of the local\nmoment. This is in stark contrast with the case of conventional mesoscopic\nconductors where $\\partial S/ \\partial V$ is frequency-independent and defined\nby the shot noise. In a helical edge, a violation of the spin-rotation symmetry\nleads to the shot noise, which becomes important only at a high bias.\nUncharacteristically for a fermion system, this noise in the backscattered\ncurrent is super-Poissonian.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss tensor network descriptions of AdS/CFT from two\ndifferent viewpoints. First, we start with an Euclidean path-integral\ncomputation of ground state wave functions with a UV cut off. We consider its\nefficient optimization by making its UV cut off position dependent and define a\nquantum state at each length scale. We conjecture that this path-integral\ncorresponds to a time slice of AdS. Next, we derive a flow of quantum states by\nrewriting the action of Killing vectors of AdS3 in terms of the dual 2d CFT.\nBoth approaches support a correspondence between the hyperbolic time slice H2\nin AdS3 and a version of continuous MERA (cMERA). We also give a heuristic\nargument why we can expect a sub-AdS scale bulk locality for holographic CFTs.\n", "  We perform in-situ two-cycle thermal cycling and annealing studies for a\ntransferred CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 on a SiO2/Si substrate, using spatially\nresolved micro-Raman and PL spectroscopy. After the thermal cycling and being\nannealed at 305 deg C twice, the film morphology and film-substrate bonding are\nsignificantly modified, which together with the removal of polymer residues\ncause major changes in the strain and doping distribution over the film, and\nthus the optical properties. Before annealing, the strain associated with\nripples in the transferred film dominates the spatial distributions of the PL\npeak position and intensity over the film; after annealing, the variation in\nfilm-substrate bonding, affecting both strain and doping, becomes the leading\nfactor. This work reveals that the film-substrate bonding, and thus the strain\nand doping, is unstable under thermal stress, which is important for\nunderstanding the substrate effects on the optical and transport properties of\nthe 2D material and their impact on device applications.\n", "  We construct a nonperturbative nonequilibrium theory for graphene electrons\ninteracting via the instantaneous Coulomb interaction by combining the\nfunctional renormalization group method with the nonequilibrium Keldysh\nformalism. The Coulomb interaction is partially bosonized in the forward\nscattering channel resulting in a coupled Fermi-Bose theory. Quantum kinetic\nequations for the Dirac fermions and the Hubbard-Stratonovich boson are derived\nin Keldysh basis, together with the exact flow equation for the effective\naction and the hierarchy of one-particle irreducible vertex functions, taking\ninto account a possible non-zero expectation value of the bosonic field.\nEventually, the system of equations is solved approximately under thermal\nequilibrium conditions at finite temperature, providing results for the\nrenormalized Fermi velocity and the static dielectric function, which extends\nthe zero-temperature results of Bauer~\\textit{et~al.}, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ B {\\bf 92},\n121409 (2015).\n", "  We report the first lattice QCD calculation of the glue spin in the nucleon.\nThe lattice calculation is carried out with valence overlap fermions on 2+1\nflavor DWF gauge configurations on four lattice spacings and four volumes\nincluding an ensemble with physical values for the quark masses. The glue spin\n$S_{G}$ in the Coulomb gauge in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme is obtained\nwith the 1-loop perturbative matching. We find the results fairly insensitive\nto lattice spacing and quark masses. We also find that the proton momentum\ndependence of $S_G$ in the range $0\\leq |\\vec{p}| < 1.5$ GeV is very mild, and\nwe determine it in the large momentum limit to be $S_{G}=0.251(47)(16)$ at the\nphysical pion mass in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\\mu^2=10$ GeV$^2$.\nIf the matching procedure in large momentum effective theory is neglected,\n$S_G$ is equal to the glue helicity measured in high-energy scattering\nexperiments.\n", "  A dilutely filled $N$-site optical lattice near zero temperature within a\nhigh-$Q$ multimode cavity can be mapped to a spin ensemble with tailorable\ninteractions at all length scales. The effective full site to site interaction\nmatrix can be dynamically controlled by the application of up to $N(N+1)/2$\nlaser beams of suitable geometry, frequency and power, which allows for the\nimplementation of quantum annealing dynamics relying on the all-to-all\neffective spin coupling controllable in real time. Via an adiabatic sweep\nstarting from a superfluid initial state one can find the lowest energy\nstationary state of this system. As the cavity modes are lossy, errors can be\namended and the ground state can still be reached even from a finite\ntemperature state via ground state cavity cooling. The physical properties of\nthe final atomic state can be directly and almost non-destructively read off\nfrom the cavity output fields. As example we simulate a quantum Hopfield\nassociative memory scheme.\n", "  We consider Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background when\nboth the neutrino temperature and neutrino number are allowed to vary from\ntheir standard values. The neutrino temperature is assumed to differ from its\nstandard model value by a fixed factor from Big Bang nucleosynthesis up to the\npresent. In this scenario, the effective number of relativistic degrees of\nfreedom, $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm CMB}$, derived from observations of the cosmic\nmicrowave background is not equal to the true number of neutrinos, $N_\\nu$. We\ndetermine the element abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a\nfunction of the neutrino number and temperature, converting the latter to the\nequivalent value of $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm CMB}$. We find that a value of $N_{\\rm\neff}^{\\rm CMB} \\approx 3$ can be made consistent with $N_\\nu = 4$ with a\ndecrease in the neutrino temperature of $\\sim 5\\%$, while $N_\\nu = 5$ is\nexcluded for any value of $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm CMB}$. No observationally-allowed\nvalues for $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm CMB}$ and $N_\\nu$ can solve the lithium problem.\n", "  We report the second complete molecular line data release from the {\\em\nCensus of High- and Medium-mass Protostars} (CHaMP), a large-scale, unbiased,\nuniform mapping survey at sub-parsec resolution, of mm-wave line emission from\n303 massive, dense molecular clumps in the Milky Way. This release is for all\n$^{12}$CO $J$=1$\\rightarrow$0 emission associated with the dense gas, the first\nfrom Phase II of the survey, which includes $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and\nC$^{18}$O. The observed clump emission traced by both $^{12}$CO and HCO$^+$\n(from Phase I) shows very similar morphology, indicating that, for dense\nmolecular clouds and complexes of all sizes, parsec-scale clumps contain $\\Xi$\n~ 75% of the mass, while only 25% of the mass lies in extended (>~ 10 pc) or\n\"low density\" components in these same areas. The mass fraction of all gas\nabove a density 10$^9$ m$^{-3}$ is $\\xi_9$ >~ 50%. This suggests that\nparsec-scale clumps may be the basic building blocks of the molecular ISM,\nrather than the standard GMC concept. Using $^{12}$CO emission, we derive\nphysical properties of these clumps in their entirety, and compare them to\nproperties from HCO$^+$, tracing their denser interiors. We compare the\nstandard X-factor converting $I_{CO}$ to $N_{H_2}$ with alternative\nconversions, and show that only the latter give whole-clump properties that are\nphysically consistent with those of their interiors. We infer that the clump\npopulation is systematically closer to virial equilibrium than when considering\nonly their interiors, with perhaps half being long-lived (10s of Myr),\npressure-confined entities which only terminally engage in vigorous massive\nstar formation, supporting other evidence along these lines previously\npublished.\n", "  The resonant filtering method transforming frequency modulated radiation\nfield into a train of short pulses is proposed to apply in optical domain.\nEffective frequency modulation can be achieved by electro-optic modulator or by\nresonant frequency modulation of the filter with a narrow absorption line. Due\nto frequency modulation narrow-spectrum CW radiation field is seen by the\nresonant filter as a comb of equidistant spectral components separated by the\nmodulation frequency. Tuning narrow-bandwidth filter in resonance with $n$-th\nspectral component of the comb transforms the radiation field into bunches of\npulses with $n$ pulses in each bunch. The transformation is explained by the\ninterference of the coherently scattered resonant component of the field with\nthe whole comb. Constructive interference results in formation of pulses, while\ndestructive interference is seen as dark windows between pulses. It is found\nthat the optimal thickness of the resonant filter is several orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the necessary thickness of the dispersive filters used\nbefore in optical domain to produce short pulses from the frequency modulated\nfield.\n", "  We characterize the carrier density profile of the ground state of graphene\nin the presence of particle-particle interaction and random charged impurity\nfor zero gate voltage. We provide detailed analysis on the resulting spatially\ninhomogeneous electron gas taking into account the particle-particle\ninteraction and the remote coulomb disorder on an equal footing within the\nThomas-Fermi-Dirac theory. We present some general features of the carrier\ndensity probability measure of the graphene sheet. We also show that, when\nviewed as a random surface, the resulting electron-hole puddles at zero\nchemical potential show peculiar self-similar statistical properties. Although\nthe disorder potential is chosen to be Gaussian, we show that the charge field\nis non-Gaussian with unusual Kondev relations which can be regarded as a new\nclass of two-dimensional (2D) random-field surfaces.\n", "  We study several types of tree-level improvement in the Yang-Mills gradient\nflow method in order to reduce the lattice discretization errors in line with\nFodor et al. [arXiv:1406.0827]. The tree-level $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ improvement\ncan be achieved in a simple manner, where an appropriate weighted average is\ncomputed between two definitions of the action density $\\langle E(t)\\rangle$\nmeasured at every flow time $t$. We further develop the idea of achieving the\ntree-level $\\mathcal{O}(a^4)$ improvement. For testing our proposal, we present\nnumerical results for $\\langle E(t) \\rangle$ obtained on gauge configurations\ngenerated with the Wilson and Iwasaki gauge actions at three lattice spacings\n($a\\approx 0.1, 0.07,$ and 0.05 fm). Our results show that tree-level improved\nflows significantly eliminate the discretization corrections on $t^2\\langle\nE(t)\\rangle$ in the relatively small-$t$ regime. To demonstrate the feasibility\nof our tree-level improvement proposal, we also study the scaling behavior of\nthe dimensionless combinations of the $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}}$\nparameter and the new reference scale $t_X$, which is defined through\n$t_X^2\\langle E(t_X)\\rangle=X$ for the smaller $X$, e.g., $X= 0.15$. It is\nfound that $\\sqrt{t_{0.15}}\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}}$ shows a nearly\nperfect scaling behavior as a function of $a^2$ regardless of the types of\ngauge action and flow, after tree-level improvement is achieved up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^4)$. Further detailed study of the scaling behavior exposes the\npresence of the remnant $\\mathcal{O}(g^{2n} a^2)$ corrections, which are beyond\nthe tree level. Although our proposal is not enough to eliminate all\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ effects, we show that the $\\mathcal{O}(g^{2n} a^2)$\ncorrections can be well under control even by the simplest tree-level\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ improved flow.\n", "  Some chemically peculiar stars in the upper main sequence show rotational\nperiod variations of unknown origin. We propose these variations are a\nconsequence of the propagation of internal waves in magnetic rotating stars\nthat lead to the torsional oscillations of the star. We simulate the\nmagnetohydrodynamic waves and calculate resonant frequencies for two stars that\nshow rotational variations: CU Vir and HD 37776. We provide updated analyses of\nrotational period variations in these stars and compare our results with\nnumerical models. For CU Vir, the length of the observed rotational-period\ncycle, $\\mathit\\Pi=67.6(5)$ yr, can be well reproduced by the models, which\npredict a cycle length of 51 yr. However, for HD 37776, the observed lower\nlimit of the cycle length, $\\mathit\\Pi\\geq100$ yr, is significantly longer than\nthe numerical models predict. We conclude that torsional oscillations provide a\nreasonable explanation at least for the observed period variations in CU Vir.\n", "  We investigate the $a_0(980)$ resonance within chiral effective field theory\nthrough a three-coupled-channel analysis, namely $\\pi\\eta$, $K\\bar{K}$ and\n$\\pi\\eta'$. A global fit to recent lattice finite-volume energy levels from\n$\\pi\\eta$ scattering and relevant experimental data on a $\\pi\\eta$ event\ndistribution and the $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\pi\\eta$ cross section is performed. Both\nthe leading and next-to-leading-order analyses lead to similar and successful\ndescriptions of the finite-volume energy levels and the experimental data.\nHowever, these two different analyses yield different $\\pi\\eta$ scattering\nphase shifts for the physical masses for the $\\pi, K, \\eta$ and $\\eta'$ mesons.\nThe inelasticities, the pole positions in the complex energy plane and their\nresidues are calculated both for unphysical and physical meson masses.\n", "  We demonstrate an all-optical method for manipulating the magnetization in a\n1-mm YIG (yttrium-iron-garnet) sphere placed in a $\\sim0.17\\,$T uniform\nmagnetic field. An harmonic of the frequency comb delivered by a multi-GHz\ninfrared laser source is tuned to the Larmor frequency of the YIG sphere to\ndrive magnetization oscillations, which in turn give rise to a radiation field\nused to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon. The radiation damping issue that\noccurs at high frequency and in the presence of highly magnetizated materials,\nhas been overcome by exploiting magnon-photon strong coupling regime in\nmicrowave cavities. Our findings demonstrate an effective technique for\nultrafast control of the magnetization vector in optomagnetic materials via\npolarization rotation and intensity modulation of an incident laser beam. We\neventually get a second-order susceptibility value of $\\sim10^{-7}$ cm$^2$/MW\nfor single crystal YIG.\n", "  Ferroelectrics usually adopt a multi-domain state with domain walls\nseparating domains with polarization axes oriented differently. It has long\nbeen recognized that domain walls can dramatically impact the properties of\nferroelectric materials. The enhancement of low-field\nsusceptibility/permittivity under subswitching conditions is usually attributed\nto the reversible domain wall vibration. Recent experiments highlight the\nstationary domain wall contribution to the dielectric susceptibility\nirrespective of any lateral displacements or deformations of the wall. We study\nthe effects of domain walls on low-field permittivity of PbTiO$_3$ with density\nfunctional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. The static dielectric\nconstant is calculated as a function of increasing domain wall density and\ntemperature. We find an increase of dielectric permittivity with increasing\ndomain wall density, which is expected to occur at low driving field where the\nlateral motion of domain walls is forbidden. Real-space decomposition of\ndielectric response reveals that frustrated dipoles within the finite width of\nthe domain walls are responsible for the enhanced low-field permittivity.\n", "  The stability of a light sail riding on a laser beam is analyzed both\nanalytically and numerically. Conical sails on Gaussian beams, which have been\nstudied in the past, are shown to be unstable without active control or\nadditional mechanical modifications. A new architecture for a passively stable\nsail-and-beam configuration is proposed. The novel spherical shell design for\nthe sail is capable of \"beam riding\" without the need for active feedback\ncontrol. Full three-dimensional ray-tracing simulations are performed to verify\nour analytical results.\n", "  KIC~8262223 is an eclipsing binary with a short orbital period ($P=1.61$ d).\nThe {\\it Kepler} light curves are of Algol-type and display deep and partial\neclipses, ellipsoidal variations, and pulsations of Delta Scuti type. We\nanalyzed the {\\it Kepler} photometric data, complemented by phase-resolved\nspectra from the R-C Spectrograph on the 4-meter Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak\nNational Observatory and determined the fundamental parameters of this system.\nThe low mass and oversized secondary ($M_2=0.20M_{\\odot}$, $R_2=1.31R_{\\odot}$)\nis the remnant of the donor star that transferred most of its mass to the\ngainer, and now the primary star. The current primary star is thus not a normal\n$\\delta$ Scuti star but the result of mass accretion from a lower mass\nprogenitor. We discuss the possible evolutionary history and demonstrate with\nthe MESA evolution code that the system can be understood as the result of\nnon-conservative binary evolution similar to that for the formation of EL CVn\ntype binaries. The pulsations of the primary star can be explained as radial\nand non-radial pressure modes. The equilibrium models from single star\nevolutionary tracks can match the observed mass and radius\n($M_1=1.94M_{\\odot}$, $R_1=1.67R_{\\odot}$) but the predicted unstable modes\nassociated with these models differ somewhat from those observed. This work\npresents a preliminary asteroseismic analysis of the abnormal Delta Scuti\npulsators, and we discuss the need for better theoretical understanding of such\npulsating mass gaining stars.\n", "  Recent work has shown that the symmetries of classical gravitational\nscattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes include, at the linearized level,\ninfinitesimal superrotations. These act like Virasoro generators on the\ncelestial sphere at null infinity. However, due to the singularities in these\ngenerators, the physical status of finite superrotations has remained unclear.\nHere we address this issue in the context of the breaking of a cosmic string\nvia quantum black hole pair nucleation. This process is described by a\ngravitational instanton known as the $C$-metric. After pair production, the\nblack holes are pulled by the string to null infinity with a constant\nacceleration. At late times the string decays and the spacetime settles into a\nvacuum state. We show that the early and late spacetimes before and after\nstring decay differ by a finite superrotation. This provides a physical\ninterpretation of superrotations. They act on spacetimes which are\nasymptotically flat everywhere except at isolated singularities with cosmic\nstring defects.\n", "  Drawing from the optimal transport theory adapted to the relativistic setting\nwe formulate the principle of a causal flow of probability and apply it in the\nwave packet formalism. We demonstrate that whereas the Dirac system is causal,\nthe relativistic-Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian impels a superluminal evolution of\nprobabilities. We quantify the causality breakdown in the latter system and\nargue that, in contrast to the popular viewpoint, it is not related to the\nlocalisation properties of the states.\n", "  The decoherence of trapped-ion quantum gates due to heating of their motional\nmodes is a fundamental science and engineering problem. This heating is\nattributed to electric-field noise arising from the trap-electrode surfaces. In\nthis work, we investigate the source of this noise by focusing on the diffusion\nof carbon-containing adsorbates on the surface of Au(110). We show by density\nfunctional theory, based on detailed scanning probe microscopy, how the carbon\nadatom diffusion on the gold surface changes the energy landscape, and how the\nadatom dipole moment varies with the diffusive motion. A simple model for the\ndiffusion noise, which varies quadratically with the variation of the dipole\nmoment, qualitatively reproduces the measured noise spectrum, and the estimate\nof the noise spectral density is in accord with measured values.\n", "  We show that a homogeneous and isotropic slab, illuminated by a circularly\npolarized beam with no topological charge, produces vortices of order two in\nthe opposite circularly polarized components of the reflected and transmitted\nfields, as a consequence of the difference between transverse magnetic and\ntransverse electric dynamics. In the epsilon-near-zero regime, we find that\nvortex generation is remarkably efficient in sub-wavelength thick slabs up to\nthe paraxial regime. This physically stems from the fact that a vacuum paraxial\nfield can excite a nonparaxial field inside an epsilon-near-zero slab since it\nhosts slowly varying fields over physically large portion of the bulk. Our\ntheoretical predictions indicate that epsilon-near-zero media hold great\npotential as nanophotonic elements for manipulating the angular momentum of the\nradiation, since they are available without resorting to complicated micro/nano\nfabrication processes and can operate even at very small (ultraviolet)\nwavelengths.\n", "  We present VLT/SINFONI imaging spectroscopy of the warm ionized gas in 33\npowerful radio galaxies at redshifts z>~2, which are excellent sites to study\nthe interplay of rapidly accreting active galactic nuclei and the interstellar\nmedium of the host galaxy in the very late formation stages of massive\ngalaxies. Our targets span two orders of magnitude in radio size (2-400 kpc)\nand kinetic jet energy (a few 10^46 to almost 10^48 erg s^-1). All sources have\ncomplex gas kinematics with broad line widths up to ~1300 km s^-1. About half\nhave bipolar velocity fields with offsets up to 1500 km s^-1 and are consistent\nwith global back-to-back outflows. The others have complex velocity\ndistributions, often with multiple abrupt velocity jumps far from the nucleus\nof the galaxy, and are not associated with a major merger in any obvious way.\nWe present several empirical constraints that show why gas kinematics and radio\njets seem to be physically related. The gas kinetic energy from large scale\nbulk and local outflow or turbulent motion corresponds to a few 10^-3 to 10^-2\nof the kinetic energy of the jet. In galaxies with jet power >~10^47 erg s^-1,\nthe bulk kinetic energy dominates the total energy budget of the gas,\nsuggesting that the outflows encompasses the global interstellar medium,\nperhaps facilitated by the strong gas turbulence. We compare with recent\nhydrodynamic simulations, and discuss the potential consequences for the\nsubsequent evolution of massive high-z galaxies. The gas-phase metallicities in\nour galaxies are lower than in most low-z AGN, but nonetheless solar or even\nsuper-solar, suggesting that the ISM in these galaxies is very similar to the\ngas from which massive low-redshift galaxies formed most of their gas. This\nfurther highlights that we are seeing these galaxies near the end of their\nactive formation phase.\n", "  The 2-dimensional electron system at the interface between LaAlO$_{3}$ and\nSrTiO$_{3}$ has several unique properties that can be tuned by an externally\napplied gate voltage. In this work, we show that this gate-tunability extends\nto the effective band structure of the system. We combine a magnetotransport\nstudy on top-gated Hall bars with self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson\ncalculations and observe a Lifshitz transition at a density of\n$2.9\\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Above the transition, the carrier density of one\nof the conducting bands decreases with increasing gate voltage. This surprising\ndecrease is accurately reproduced in the calculations if electronic\ncorrelations are included. These results provide a clear, intuitive picture of\nthe physics governing the electronic structure at complex oxide interfaces.\n", "  We calculate the fluxes of neutrinos and gamma rays from interactions of\ncosmic rays with interstellar matter in our galaxy. We use EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL and\nGHEISHA to obtain the yield of these particles in proton, helium and iron\ncollisions at kinetic energies between 1 and 10^8 GeV, and we correlate the\ncosmic ray density with the mean magnetic field strength in the disk and the\nhalo of our galaxy. We find that at E>1 PeV the fluxes depend very strongly on\nthe cosmic-ray composition, whereas at 1-5 GeV the main source of uncertainty\nis the cosmic-ray spectrum out of the heliosphere. We show that the diffuse\nflux of galactic neutrinos becomes larger than the conventional atmospheric one\nat E>1 PeV, but that at all IceCube energies it is 4 times smaller than the\natmospheric flux from forward-charm decays.\n", "  Diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) such as the\ndynamical vertex approximation (D$\\Gamma$A) allow us to include non-local\ncorrelations beyond DMFT on all length scales and proved their worth for model\ncalculations. Here, we develop and implement an AbinitioD$\\Gamma$A approach for\nelectronic structure calculations of materials. Starting point is the\ntwo-particle irreducible vertex in the two particle-hole channels which is\napproximated by the bare non-local Coulomb interaction and all local vertex\ncorrections. From this we calculate the full non-local vertex and the non-local\nself-energy through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The AbinitioD$\\Gamma$A\napproach naturally generates all local DMFT correlations and all non-local $GW$\ncontributions, but also further non-local correlations beyond: mixed terms of\nthe former two and non-local spin fluctuations. We apply this new methodology\nto the prototypical correlated metal SrVO$_3$.\n", "  The majority of investigations characterizing the motion of single or\nmultiple particles in fluid flows consider canonical body shapes, such as\nspheres, cylinders, discs, etc. However, protrusions on bodies -- being either\nas surface imperfections or appendages that serve a function -- are ubiquitous\nin both nature and applications. In this work, we characterize how the dynamics\nof a sphere with an axis-symmetric wake is modified in the presence of thin\nthree-dimensional elliptic-shaped protrusions. By investigating a wide range of\nthree-dimensional appendages with different aspect ratios and lengths, we\nclearly show that the sphere with an appendage may robustly undergo an\ninverted-pendulum-like (IPL) instability. This means that the position of the\nappendage placed behind the sphere and aligned with the free-stream direction\nis unstable, in a similar way that an inverted pendulum is unstable under\ngravity. Due to this instability, non-trivial forces are generated on the body,\nleading to turn and drift, if the body is free to fall under gravity. Moreover,\nwe identify the aspect ratio and length of the appendage that induces the\nlargest side force on the sphere, and therefore also the largest drift for a\nfreely falling body. Finally, we explain the physical mechanisms behind these\nobservations in the context of the IPL instability, i.e., the balance between\nsurface area of the appendage exposed to reversed flow in the wake and the\nsurface area of the appendage exposed to fast free-stream flow.\n", "  In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a new way of controlling the\ngroup velocity of an optical pulse by using a combination of spectral hole\nburning, slow light effect and linear Stark effect in a rare-earth-ion-doped\ncrystal. The group velocity can be changed continuously by a factor of 20\nwithout significant pulse distortion or absorption of the pulse energy. With a\nsimilar technique, an optical pulse can also be compressed in time. Theoretical\nsimulations were developed to simulate the group velocity control and the pulse\ncompression processes. The group velocity as well as the pulse reshaping are\nsolely controlled by external voltages which makes it promising in quantum\ninformation and quantum communication processes. It is also proposed that the\ngroup velocity can be changed even more in an Er doped crystal while at the\nsame time having a transmission band matching the telecommunication wavelength.\n", "  We present a simple and natural dark sector model in which dark matter\nparticles arise as composite states of hidden strong dynamics and their\nstability is ensured by accidental symmetries. The model has only a few free\nparameters. In particular, the gauge symmetry of the model forbids the masses\nof dark quarks, and the confinement scale of the dynamics provides the unique\nmass scale of the model. The gauge group contains an Abelian symmetry $U(1)_D$,\nwhich couples the dark and standard model sectors through kinetic mixing. This\nmodel, despite its simple structure, has rich and distinctive phenomenology. In\nthe case where the dark pion becomes massive due to $U(1)_D$ quantum\ncorrections, direct and indirect detection experiments can probe thermal relic\ndark matter which is generically a mixture of the dark pion and the dark\nbaryon, and the Large Hadron Collider can discover the $U(1)_D$ gauge boson.\nAlternatively, if the dark pion stays light due to a specific $U(1)_D$ charge\nassignment of the dark quarks, then the dark pion constitutes dark radiation.\nThe signal of this radiation is highly correlated with that of dark baryons in\ndark matter direct detection.\n", "  We construct exact initial data for closed cosmological models filled with\nregularly arranged black holes in the presence of $\\Lambda$. The intrinsic\ngeometry of the 3-dimensional space described by this data is a sum of simple\nclosed-form expressions, while the extrinsic curvature is just proportional to\n$\\Lambda$. We determine the mass of each of the black holes in this space by\nperforming a limiting procedure around the location of each of the black holes,\nand then compare the result to an appropriate slice through the\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. The consequences of the inhomogeneity of\nthis model for the large-scale expansion of space are then found by comparing\nthe lengths of curves in the cosmological region to similar curves in a\nsuitably chosen Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solution. Finally,\nwe locate the positions of the apparent horizons of the black holes, and\ndetermine the extremal values of their mass, for every possible regular\narrangement of masses. We find that as the number of black holes is increased,\nthe large-scale expansion of space approaches that of an FLRW model filled with\ndust and $\\Lambda$, and that the extremal values of the black hole masses\napproaches that of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution.\n", "  The spin reorientation transition of an ultrathin film from perpendicular to\nin-plane magnetization is driven by a competition between dipole and anisotropy\nenergies. \\textit{In situ} measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of Fe/2\nML Ni/W(110) films as a function of Fe coverage, made as the films are\ndeposited at constant temperature, show two clear peaks; one at the long-range\nand one at the local realization of the transition. In the long-range\nrealization, the susceptibility probes the striped domain pattern that is\nformed in response to the balance of energetics on a mesoscopic scale. Here the\nreorientation transition occurs at a non-integer layer thickness. In the local\nrealization, the susceptibility probes the response of small islands with\nin-plane anisotropy in the 3rd atomic Fe layer that are grown on the 2nd atomic\nFe layer, which has perpendicular anisotropy. It is a response to the local\nfinite-size, metastable energetics due to discrete steps in thickness. An\nexcellent quantitative description of the susceptibility data is obtained when\nboth local and long-range aspects of the spin reorientation transition are\nincluded.\n", "  [Abridged] Snowlines in protoplanetary disks play an important role in planet\nformation and composition. Since the CO snowline is difficult to observe\ndirectly with CO emission, its location has been inferred in several disks from\nspatially resolved ALMA observations of DCO+ and N2H+. N2H+ is considered to be\na good tracer of the CO snowline based on astrochemical considerations\npredicting an anti-correlation between N2H+ and gas-phase CO. In this work, the\nrobustness of N2H+ as a tracer of the CO snowline is investigated. A simple\nchemical network is used in combination with the radiative transfer code LIME\nto model the N2H+ distribution and corresponding emission in the disk around TW\nHya. The assumed CO and N2 abundances, corresponding binding energies, cosmic\nray ionization rate, and degree of large-grain settling are varied to determine\nthe effects on the N2H+ emission and its relation to the CO snowline. For the\nadopted physical structure of the TW Hya disk and molecular binding energies\nfor pure ices, the balance between freeze-out and thermal desorption predicts a\nCO snowline at 19 AU, corresponding to a CO midplane freeze-out temperature of\n20 K. A model with a total, i.e. gas plus ice, CO abundance of 3e-6 with\nrespect to H2 fits the position of the emission peak observed by Qi et al. 2013\nfor the TW Hya disk. However, the relationship between N2H+ and the CO snowline\nis more complicated than generally assumed: for the investigated parameters,\nthe N2H+ column density peaks at least 5 AU outside the CO snowline. Moreover,\nthe N2H+ emission can peak much further out, as far as ~50 AU beyond the\nsnowline. Hence, chemical modeling, as done here, is necessary to derive a CO\nsnowline location from N2H+ observations.\n", "  (Abridged) We combine deep HST grism spectroscopy with a new Bayesian method\nto derive maps of gas-phase metallicity, nebular dust extinction, and\nstar-formation rate for 10 star-forming galaxies at high redshift\n($1.2<z<2.3$). Exploiting lensing magnification by the foreground cluster\nMACS1149.6+2223, we reach sub-kpc spatial resolution and push the stellar mass\nlimit associated with such high-z spatially resolved measurements below\n$10^8M_\\odot$ for the first time. Our maps exhibit diverse morphologies,\nindicative of various effects such as efficient radial mixing from tidal\ntorques, rapid accretion of low-metallicity gas, etc., which can affect the gas\nand metallicity distributions in individual galaxies. Based upon an exhaustive\nsample of all existing sub-kpc metallicity gradients at high-z, we find that\npredictions given by analytical chemical evolution models assuming a relatively\nextended star-formation profile in the early disk formation phase can explain\nthe majority of observed gradients, without involving galactic feedback or\nradial outflows. We observe a tentative correlation between stellar mass and\nmetallicity gradient, consistent with the downsizing galaxy formation picture\nthat more massive galaxies are more evolved into a later phase of disk growth,\nwhere they experience more coherent mass assembly at all radii and thus show\nshallower metallicity gradients. In addition, we compile a sample of\nhomogeneously cross-calibrated integrated metallicity measurements spanning\nthree orders of magnitude in stellar mass at $z\\sim1.8$. We use this sample to\nstudy the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and test the fundamental metallicity\nrelation (FMR). The slope of the observed MZR can rule out the momentum-driven\nwind model at 3-$\\sigma$ confidence level. We find no significant offset with\nrespect to the FMR, taking into account the intrinsic scatter and measurement\nuncertainties.\n", "  Spin-orbitronics and Dirac quasiparticles are two fields of condensed matter\nphysics initiated independently about a decade ago. Here we predict that Dirac\nquasiparticles can be controlled by the spin-orbit torque reorientation of the\nN\\'{e}el vector in an antiferromagnet. Using CuMnAs as an example, we formulate\nsymmetry criteria allowing for the co-existence of Dirac quasiparticles and\nN\\'{e}el spin-orbit torques. We identify the non-symmorphic crystal symmetry\nprotection of Dirac band crossings whose on and off switching is mediated by\nthe N\\'{e}el vector reorientation. We predict that this concept, verified by\nminimal model and density functional calculations in the CuMnAs semimetal\nantiferromagnet, can lead to a topological metal-insulator transition driven by\nthe N\\'{e}el vector and to the corresponding topological anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance.\n", "  The protoplanetary disk around the GGTau A binary system is so far one of the\nmost studied young circumbinary disk. Observations of the dust continuum\nemission at sub-mm/mm wavelengths detected a dust ring located between 200AU\nand 300AU from the center of mass of the system. If the disk and the binary\norbit are coplanar, given the observed projected separation of the stars in the\nbinary system, the classical theory of tidal interaction between a binary\nsystem and its circumbinary disk predicts a truncation radius which is\nsignificantly smaller than the measured inner radius of the mm-sized dust ring.\nWe investigate the origin of this dust ring structure in the GG Tau A disk,\ntest whether the interaction between the binary and the disk can produce a dust\ntrap at the location of the observed ring, and discuss an alternative scenario\nwhich invokes a misalignment between the disk and the stellar orbital planes.\nWe run a set of hydrodynamical simulations for an orbit consistent with the\nastrometric solutions for the GG Tau A stellar proper motions, and for\ndifferent disk temperature and viscosities. We then apply a dust evolution\nmodel in post-processing in order to to retrieve the distribution of mm-sized\ngrains. Comparing models and observations, we show that, if the binary orbit\nand the disk were coplanar,the tidal truncation of the circumbinary disk would\noccur at a radius that is too small compared to the inner edge inferred by the\ndust observations, and that the pressure bump and the dust ring in the models\nwould be located at <150AU from the center of mass of the stellar system. This\nshows that the GG Tau A disk cannot be coplanar with the binary orbital plane.\nWe also discuss the viability of the misaligned disk scenario, suggesting that\nin order for dust trapping to occur at the observed radius, the disk and\norbital plane must be misaligned by an angle of about 25 degrees.\n", "  From existing broad-band images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, we\nlocated 92 globules, for which we derived positions, dimensions, orientations,\nextinctions, masses, proper motions, and their distributions. The globules have\nmean radii ranging from 400 to 2000 AU and are not resolved in current infrared\nimages of the nebula. The extinction law for dust grains in these globules\nmatches a normal interstellar extinction law. Derived masses of dust range from\n1 to 60 x 10^(-6) solar masses, and the total mass contained in globules\nconstitute a fraction of approximately 2% or less of the total dust content of\nthe nebula. The globules are spread over the outer part of the nebula, and a\nfraction of them coincide in position with emission filaments, where we find\nelongated globules that are aligned with these filaments. Only 10% of the\nglobules are coincident in position with the numerous H2-emitting knots found\nin previous studies. All globules move outwards from the centre with\ntransversal velocities of 60 to 1600 km/s, along with the general expansion of\nthe remnant. We discuss various hypotheses for the formation of globules in the\nCrab Nebula.\n", "  I propose a general, covariant way of defining when one region is \"deeper in\nthe bulk\" than another. This definition is formulated outside of an event\nhorizon (or in the absence thereof) in generic geometries; it may be applied to\nboth points and surfaces, and may be used to compare the depth of bulk points\nor surfaces relative to a particular boundary subregion or relative to the\nentire boundary. Using the recently proposed \"lightcone cut\" formalism, the\ncomparative depth between two bulk points can be determined from the\nsingularity structure of Lorentzian correlators in the dual field theory. I\nprove that, by this definition, causal wedges of progressively larger regions\nprobe monotonically deeper in the bulk. The definition furthermore matches\nexpectations in pure AdS and in static AdS black holes with isotropic spatial\nslices, where a well-defined holographic coordinate exists. In terms of\nholographic RG flow, this new definition of bulk depth makes contact with\ncoarse-graining over both large distances and long time scales.\n", "  We examine how the distribution of contour lengths and the high-stretch\nstiffening of individual chain segments affect the macroscopic shear modulus of\nflexible polymer gels, using a 2D numerical model, in which polymer segments\nform a triangular network and disorder is introduced by varying their contour\nlengths. We show that in the relevant parameter range: (i) the non-affine\ncontribution to the shear modulus is negligible, i.e. the Born approximation is\nsatisfactory; (ii) the shear modulus is dominated by the contribution\noriginating from equilibrium chain tensions. Moreover, mechanical equilibration\nat the nodes induces specific correlations between the end-to-end distances and\ncontour lengths of chain segments, which must be properly accounted for to\nconstruct reasonable estimates of chain pressure and shear modulus.\n", "  We extend previous results on healthy derivative self-interactions for a\nProca field to the case of a set of massive vector fields. We obtain non-gauge\ninvariant derivative self-interactions for the vector fields that maintain the\nappropriate number of propagating degrees of freedom. In view of the potential\ncosmological applications, we restrict to interactions with an internal\nrotational symmetry. We provide a systematical construction order by order in\nderivatives of the fields and making use of the antisymmetric Levi-Civita\ntensor. We then compare with the one single vector field case and show that the\ninteractions can be broadly divided into two groups, namely the ones obtained\nfrom a direct extension of the generalized Proca terms and genuine multi-Proca\ninteractions with no correspondence in the single Proca case. We also discuss\nthe curved spacetime version of the interactions to include the necessary\nnon-minimal couplings to gravity. Finally, we explore the cosmological\napplications and show that there are three different vector fields\nconfigurations giving rise to isotropic solutions. Two of them have already\nbeen considered in the literature and the third one, representing a combination\nof the first two, is new and offers unexplored cosmological scenarios.\n", "  The ATLASGAL survey provides an ideal basis for detailed studies of large\nnumbers of massive star forming clumps covering the whole range of evolutionary\nstages. The ATLASGAL Top100 is a sample of clumps selected from their infrared\nand radio properties to be representative for the whole range of evolutionary\nstages. The ATLASGAL Top100 sources are the focus of a number of detailed\nfollow-up studies that will be presented in a series of papers. In the present\nwork we use the dust continuum emission to constrain the physical properties of\nthis sample and identify trends as a function of source evolution.\n  We determine flux densities from mid-infrared to submm wavelength (8-870\nmicron) images and use these values to fit their spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) and determine their dust temperature and flux. Combining these with\nrecent distances from the literature including maser parallax measurements we\ndetermine clump masses, luminosities and column densities. We find trends for\nincreasing temperature, luminosity and column density with the proposed\nevolution sequence, confirming that this sample is representative of different\nevolutionary stages of massive star formation. We show that most of the sample\nhas the ability to form massive stars (including the most massive O-type stars)\nand that the majority is gravitationally unstable and hence likely to be\ncollapsing.\n  The highest column density ATLASGAL sources presented cover the whole range\nof evolutionary stages from the youngest to the most evolved high-mass star\nforming clumps. Their study provides a unique starting point for more in-depth\nresearch on massive star formation in four distinct evolutionary stages whose\nwell defined physical parameters afford more detailed studies. As most of the\nsample is closer than 5 kpc, these sources are also ideal for follow-up\nobservations with high spatial resolution.\n", "  We evaluate the $\\Lambda_c\\Sigma_c\\pi$ coupling constant ($G_{\\Lambda_c\n\\Sigma_c \\pi}$) and the width of the strong decay $\\Sigma_c\n\\rightarrow\\Lambda_c \\pi$ in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD on four different ensembles\nwith pion masses ranging from 700 MeV to 300 MeV. We find $G_{\\Lambda_c\n\\Sigma_c \\pi}=18.332(1.476)_{\\rm{stat.}}(2.171)_{\\rm{syst.}}$ and the decay\nwidth $\\Gamma(\\Sigma_c \\rightarrow\\Lambda_c\n\\pi)=1.65(28)_{\\rm{stat.}}(30)_{\\rm{syst.}}$~MeV on the physical quark-mass\npoint, which is in agreement with the recent experimental determination.\n", "  We consider two-component fermions with short-range interactions and large\nscattering length. This system has universal properties that are realized in\nseveral different fields of physics. In the limit of large fermion-fermion\nscattering length $a_\\mathrm{ff}$ and zero-range interaction, all properties of\nthe system scale proportionally with $a_\\mathrm{ff}$. For the case with shallow\nbound dimers, we calculate the dimer-dimer scattering phase shifts using\nlattice effective field theory. We extract the universal dimer-dimer scattering\nlength $a_\\mathrm{dd}/a_\\mathrm{ff}=0.618(30)$ and effective range\n$r_\\mathrm{dd}/a_\\mathrm{ff}=-0.431(48)$. This result for the effective range\nis the first calculation with quantified and controlled systematic errors. We\nalso benchmark our methods by computing the fermion-dimer scattering parameters\nand testing some predictions of conformal scaling of irrelevant operators near\nthe unitarity limit.\n", "  We study properties of a periodically driven system coupled to a thermal\nbath. As a nontrivial example, we consider periodically driven metallic system\ncoupled to a superconducting bath. The effect of the superconductor on the\ndriven system is two-fold: it (a) modifies density of states in the metal via\nthe proximity effect and (b) acts as a thermal bath for light-excited\nquasi-particles. Using Keldysh formalism, we calculate, nonpertubatively in the\nsystem-bath coupling, the steady-state properties of the system and obtain\nnon-equilibrium distribution function. The latter allows one to calculate\nobservable quantities which can be spectroscopically measured in tunneling\nexperiments.\n", "  Electronic properties of few-layer phosphorenes are investigated by the\ngeneralized tight-binding model. They are greatly diversified by the electric\nand magnetic fields ($E_z$ and $B_z$). The $E_z$-induced gap transition, Dirac\ncones, oscillatory bands and critical points are present in bilayer system, but\nabsent in monolayer one. The diverse magnetic quantization phenomena cover the\ncoexistent two subgroups of Landau levels, the uniform and non-uniform energy\nspacings, and the crossing and anti-crossing behaviors. Specifically, the\nwavefunctions exhibit the dramatic changes between the well-behaved and\nmulti-mode oscillations. The feature-rich energy spectra are reveled in density\nof states as .many special structures which could be verified from scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  Using lunar seismological data, constraints have been proposed on the\navailable parameter space of macroscopic dark matter (macros). We show that\nactual limits are considerably weaker by considering in greater detail the\nmechanism through which macro impacts generate detectable seismic waves, which\nhave wavelengths considerably longer than the diameter of the macro. We show\nthat the portion of the macro parameter space that can be ruled out by current\nseismological evidence is considerably smaller than previously reported, and\nspecifically that candidates with greater than or equal to nuclear density are\nnot excluded by lunar seismology.\n", "  A quantum mechanical formulation of de Sitter cosmological spacetimes still\neludes string theory. In this paper we conjecture a potentially rigorous\nframework in which the status of de Sitter space is the same as that of a\nresonance in a scattering process. We conjecture that transition amplitudes\nbetween certain states with asymptotically supersymmetric flat vacua contain\nresonant poles characteristic metastable intermediate states. A calculation\nemploying constrained instantons illustrates this idea.\n", "  We use coupled-cluster quantum chemical methods to calculate the energetics\nof molecular clusters cut out of periodic molecular hydrogen structures that\nmodel observed phases of solid hydrogen. The hydrogen structures are obtained\nfrom Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations at pressures of\n150, 250 and 350 GPa, which are within the pressure range in which phases II,\nIII and IV are found to be stable. The calculated deviations in the DFT\nenergies from the coupled-cluster data are reported for different functionals,\nand optimized functionals are generated which provide reduced errors. We give\nrecommendations for semi-local and hybrid density functionals that are expected\nto accurately describe hydrogen at high pressures.\n", "  A primordial magnetic field (PMF) present before recombination can leave\nspecific signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. Of\nparticular importance is its contribution to the B-mode polarization power\nspectrum. Indeed, vortical modes sourced by the PMF can dominate the B-mode\npower spectrum on small scales, as they survive damping up to a small fraction\nof the Silk length. Therefore, measurements of the B-mode polarization at\nhigh-$\\ell$ , such as the one recently performed by the South Pole Telescope\n(SPT), have the potential to provide stringent constraints on the PMF. We use\nthe publicly released SPT B-mode polarization spectrum, along with the\ntemperature and polarization data from the Planck satellite, to derive\nconstraints on the magnitude, the spectral index and the energy scale at which\nthe PMF was generated. We find that, while Planck data constrains the magnetic\namplitude to $B_{1 \\, \\text{Mpc}} < 3.3$ nG at 95\\% confidence level (CL), the\nSPT measurement improves the constraint to $B_{1 \\, \\text{Mpc}} < 1.5$ nG. The\nmagnetic spectral index, $n_B$, and the time of the generation of the PMF are\nunconstrained. For a nearly scale-invariant PMF, predicted by simplest\ninflationary magnetogenesis models, the bound from Planck+SPT is $B_{1 \\,\n\\text{Mpc}} < 1.2$ nG at 95% CL. For PMF with $n_B=2$, expected for fields\ngenerated in post-inflationary phase transitions, the 95% CL bound is $B_{1 \\,\n\\text{Mpc}} < 0.002$ nG, corresponding to the magnetic fraction of the\nradiation density $\\Omega_{B\\gamma} < 10^{-3}$ or the effective field $B_{\\rm\neff} < 100$ nG. The patches for the Boltzmann code CAMB and the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo engine CosmoMC, incorporating the PMF effects on CMB, are made\npublicly available.\n", "  Quantum corrections to Thomas-Fermi (TF) theory are investigated for\nnoninteracting one-dimensional fermions with known uniform semiclassical\napproximations to the density and kinetic energy. Their structure is analyzed,\nand contributions from distinct phase space regions (classically-allowed versus\nforbidden at the Fermi energy) are derived analytically. Universal formulas are\nderived for both particle numbers and energy components in each region. For\nexample, in the semiclassical limit, exactly 1/(6\\pi3^{1/2}) of a particle\nleaks into the evanescent region beyond a turning point. The correct\nnormalization of semiclassical densities is proven analytically in the\nsemiclassical limit. Energies and densities are tested numerically in a variety\nof one-dimensional potentials, especially in the limit where TF theory becomes\nexact. The subtle relation between the pointwise accuracy of the semiclassical\napproximation and integrated expectation values is explored. The limitations of\nthe semiclassical formulas are also investigated when the potential varies too\nrapidly. The approximations are shown to work for multiple wells, except right\nat the mid-phase point of the evanescent regions. The implications for density\nfunctional approximations are discussed.\n", "  We describe the Bayesian BARCODE formalism that has been designed towards the\nreconstruction of the Cosmic Web in a given volume on the basis of the sampled\ngalaxy cluster distribution. Based on the realization that the massive compact\nclusters are responsible for the major share of the large scale tidal force\nfield shaping the anisotropic and in particular filamentary features in the\nCosmic Web. Given the nonlinearity of the constraints imposed by the cluster\nconfigurations, we resort to a state-of-the-art constrained reconstruction\ntechnique to find a proper statistically sampled realization of the original\ninitial density and velocity field in the same cosmic region. Ultimately, the\nsubsequent gravitational evolution of these initial conditions towards the\nimplied Cosmic Web configuration can be followed on the basis of a proper\nanalytical model or an N-body computer simulation. The BARCODE formalism\nincludes an implicit treatment for redshift space distortions. This enables a\ndirect reconstruction on the basis of observational data, without the need for\na correction of redshift space artifacts. In this contribution we provide a\ngeneral overview of the the Cosmic Web connection with clusters and a\ndescription of the Bayesian BARCODE formalism. We conclude with a presentation\nof its successful workings with respect to test runs based on a simulated large\nscale matter distribution, in physical space as well as in redshift space.\n", "  The dark photon and the axion (or axion-like particle) are popular light\nparticles of the hidden sector. Each of them has been actively searched for\nthrough the couplings called the vector portal and the axion portal. We\nintroduce a new portal connecting the dark photon and the axion\n(axion--photon--dark photon, axion--dark photon--dark photon), which emerges in\nthe presence of the two particles. This dark axion portal is genuinely new\ncouplings, not just from a product of the vector portal and the axion portal,\nbecause of the internal structure of these couplings. We present a simple model\nthat realizes the dark axion portal and discuss why it warrants a rich\nphenomenology.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the high-frequency shear modulus measured in\nthe kHz range is compared to the mean-squared displacement measured in the\nnanosecond range for the two van der Waals bonded glass-forming liquids cumene\nand 5PPE. This provides an experimental test for the assumption connecting two\nversions of the shoving model for the non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of\nthe relaxation time in glass formers. The two versions of the model are also\ntested directly and both are shown to work well for these liquids.\n", "  We study the universal contributions to the entanglement entropy (EE) of 2+1d\nand 3+1d holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) on topologically\nnon-trivial manifolds, focusing on tori. The holographic bulk corresponds to\nAdS-soliton geometries. We characterize the properties of these\nregulator-independent EE terms as a function of both the size of the\ncylindrical entangling region, and the shape of the torus. In 2+1d, in the\nsimple limit where the torus becomes a thin 1d ring, the EE reduces to a\nshape-independent constant $2\\gamma$. This is twice the EE obtained by\nbipartitioning an infinite cylinder into equal halves. We study the RG flow of\n$\\gamma$ by defining a renormalized EE that 1) is applicable to general QFTs,\n2) resolves the failure of the area law subtraction, and 3) is inspired by the\nF-theorem. We find that the renormalized $\\gamma$ decreases monotonically when\nthe holographic CFT is deformed by a relevant operator for all allowed scaling\ndimensions. We also discuss the question of non-uniqueness of such renormalized\nEEs both in 2+1d and 3+1d.\n", "  We propose a novel branch of the Galilean Genesis scenario as an alternative\nto inflation, in which the universe starts expanding from Minkowski in the\nasymptotic past with a gross violation of the null energy condition (NEC). This\nvariant, described by several functions and parameters within the Horndeski\nscalar-tensor theory, shares the same background dynamics with the existing\nGenesis models, but the nature of primordial quantum fluctuations is quite\ndistinct. In some cases, tensor perturbations grow on superhorizon scales. The\ntensor power spectrum can be red, blue, or scale invariant, depending on the\nmodel, while scalar perturbations are nearly scale invariant. This is in sharp\ncontrast to typical NEC-violating cosmologies, in which a blue tensor tilt is\ngenerated. Though the primordial tensor and scalar spectra are both nearly\nscale invariant as in the inflationary scenario, the consistency relation in\nour variant of Galilean Genesis is non-standard.\n", "  This study presents a search for IR excess in the 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 $\\mu$m\nbands in a sample of 216 targets, composed of solar sibling, twin and analog\nstars observed by the \\textit{WISE} mission. In general, an infrared excess\nsuggests the existence of warm dust around a star. We detected 12 $\\mu$m and/or\n22 $\\mu$m excesses at the 3$\\sigma$ level of confidence in five solar analog\nstars, corresponding to a frequency of 4.1 $\\%$ of the entire sample of solar\nanalogs analyzed, and in one out of 29 solar sibling candidates, confirming\nprevious studies. The estimation of the dust properties shows that the sources\nwith infrared excesses possess circumstellar material with temperatures that,\nwithin the uncertainties, are similar to that of the material found in the\nasteroid belt in our solar system. No photospheric flux excess was identified\nat the W1 (3.4 $\\mu$m) and W2 (4.6 $\\mu$m) \\textit{WISE} bands, indicating\nthat, in the majority of stars of the present sample, no detectable dust is\ngenerated. Interestingly, among the sixty solar twin stars analyzed in this\nwork, no \\textit{WISE} photospheric flux excess was detected. However, a\nnull-detection excess does not necessarily indicate the absence of dust around\na star because different causes, including dynamic processes and instrument\nlimitations, can mask its presence.\n", "  We study the effect of the elastic scattering on the non-thermal WIMP, which\nis produced by direct decay of heavy particles at the end of reheating. The\nnon-thermal WIMP becomes important when the reheating temperature is well below\nthe freeze-out temperature. Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.\nOne is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly\nthermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations. The\ncorresponding relic abundance is determined by the thermally averaged\nannihilation cross-section at the reheating temperature. The other one is that\nthe initial abundance is too small for the dark matter to annihilate so that\nthe final relic is determined by the initial amount itself. We study the\nregions between these two limits, and show that the relic density depends not\nonly on the annihilation rate, but also on the elastic scattering rate.\nEspecially, the relic abundance of the p-wave annihilating dark matter\ncrucially relies on the elastic scattering rate because the annihilation\ncross-section is sensitive to the dark matter velocity. We categorize the\nparameter space into several regions where each region has distinctive\nmechanism for determining the relic abundance of the dark matter at the present\nUniverse. The consequence on the (in)direct detection is also studied.\n", "  We use x-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as its linear and circular\nmagnetic dichroisms to characterize relevant interactions and energy scales in\nthe surface intermetallic CePt$_5$/Pt(111). The experiments provide insight\ninto crystal field splitting, effective paramagnetic moments, their Kondo\nscreening and mutual interactions and thus into many aspects which typically\ndetermine the low temperature behavior of correlated rare earth compounds.\nExploiting the tuneability of Ce valence through the thickness dependent\nepitaxial strain at the CePt$_5$/Pt(111) interface, we are able to\nsystematically investigate the impact of hybridization strength on these\ninteractions. Considerable Kondo screening is indeed observed at all CePt$_5$\nthicknesses, and found to be strongest in case of strongest hybridization.\nWhile the magnetic response is commensurate with an impurity Kondo scale of\n$T_K \\gtrsim 10^2$ K for specimen temperatures $T \\gtrsim 30$ K, this is no\nlonger the case at lower temperature. Its detailed study by XMCD at one\nspecific thickness of CePt$_5$ reveals an anomaly of the susceptibility at $T^*\n\\approx 25$ K instead, which we tentatively associate with the onset of lattice\ncoherence. At lowest temperature we observe paramagnetic saturation with a\nsmall Ce $4f$ saturation magnetization. Within the framework of itinerant $4f$\nelectrons, saturation is due to a field induced Lifshitz transition involving a\nvery heavy band with correspondingly small degeneracy temperature of $T_F\n\\approx 7$ K. This small energy scale results in the persistence of Curie-Weiss\nbehavior across the entire range of experimentally accessible temperatures ($T\n\\gtrsim 2$ K). Our work highlights the potential of magnetic circular dichroism\nstudies in particular for Kondo and heavy fermion materials, which so far has\nremained largely unexplored.\n", "  Fully accounting for non-dipole effects in the electron dynamics, double\nionization is studied for He driven by a near-infrared laser field and for Xe\ndriven by a mid-infrared laser field. Using a three-dimensional semiclassical\nmodel, the average sum of the electron momenta along the propagation direction\nof the laser field is computed. This sum is found to be an order of magnitude\nlarger than twice the average electron momentum along the propagation direction\nof the laser field in single ionization. Moreover, the average sum of the\nelectron momenta in double ionization is found to be maximum at intensities\nsmaller than the intensities satisfying previously predicted criteria for the\nonset of magnetic field effects. It is shown that strong recollisions are the\nreason for this unexpectedly large value of the sum of the momenta along the\ndirection of the magnetic component of the Lorentz force.\n", "  Although oxygen is an important tracer of the early Galactic evolution, its\nabundance trends with metallicity are still relatively poorly known at [Fe/H] <\n-2.5. This is in part due to a lack of reliable oxygen abundance indicators in\nthe metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.\nIn this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant\nHD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was\nto understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of\noxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained\nusing standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was\ndetermined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330\nnm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D\nLTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical\nATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance\ncorrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in\nprevious studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined\nfrom OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential\nand the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D\nLTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of\nA(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13. This is in fair agreement with the oxygen abundance\nobtained from OH IR lines, A(O) = 6.39 +/- 0.11, but it is noticeably lower\nthan that determined using the forbidden [OI] line, A(O) = 6.53 +/- 0.15. While\nthe exact cause for this discrepancy remains unclear, it is very likely that\nnon-LTE effects may play a decisive role here.\n", "  We give a detailed account of the phenomenology of all-order resummations of\nlogarithmically enhanced contributions at small momentum fraction of the\nobserved hadron in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation and the\ntime-like scale evolution of parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions. The\nformalism to perform resummations in Mellin moment space is briefly reviewed,\nand all relevant expressions up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order\nare derived, including their explicit dependence on the factorization and\nrenormalization scales. We discuss the details pertinent to a proper numerical\nimplementation of the resummed results comprising an iterative solution to the\ntime-like evolution equations, the matching to known fixed-order expressions,\nand the choice of the contour in the Mellin inverse transformation. First\nextractions of parton-to-pion fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive\nannihilation data are performed at different logarithmic orders of the\nresummations in order to estimate their phenomenological relevance. To this\nend, we compare our results to corresponding fits up to fixed,\nnext-to-next-to-leading order accuracy and study the residual dependence on the\nfactorization scale in each case.\n", "  We perform a thorough study of an extended Hubbard model featuring local and\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion. Using dynamical mean-field theory we\ninvestigated the zero temperature phase-diagram of this model as a function of\nthe chemical doping. The interplay between local and non-local interaction\ndrives a variety of phase-transitions connecting two distinct charge-ordered\ninsulators, i.e., half-filled and quarter-filled, a charge-ordered metal and a\nMott insulating phase. We characterize these transitions and the relative\nstability of the solutions and we show that the two interactions conspire to\nstabilize the quarter-filled charge ordered phase.\n", "  The aim of this work is to provided the details of a calculation summarized\nin the recent paper by Maltz and Susskind which conjectured a potentially\nrigorous framework where the status of de Sitter space is the same as that of a\nresonance in a scattering process. The conjecture being that transition\namplitudes between certain states with asymptotically supersymmetric flat vacua\ncontain resonant poles characteristic metastable intermediate states. A\ncalculation employing constrained instantons is presented that illustrates this\nidea.\n", "  Theoretical predictions need quantified uncertainties for a meaningful\ncomparison to experimental results. This is an idea which presently permeates\nthe field of theoretical nuclear physics. In light of the recent progress in\nestimating theoretical uncertainties in ab initio nuclear physics, we here\npresent and compare methods for evaluating the statistical part of the\nuncertainties. A special focus is put on the (for the field) novel method of\nLagrange multipliers (LM). Uncertainties from the fit of the nuclear\ninteraction to experimental data are propagated to a few observables in\nlight-mass nuclei to highlight any differences between the presented methods.\nThe main conclusion is that the LM method is more robust, while covariance\nbased methods are less demanding in their evaluation.\n", "  We investigate the response of the bound state structure of a two-boson\nsystem, within a Yukawa model with a scalar boson exchange, to the inclusion of\nthe cross-ladder contribution to the ladder kernel of the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation. The equation is solved by means of the Nakanishi integral\nrepresentation and light-front projection. The valence light-front wave\nfunction and the elastic electromagnetic form factor beyond the impulse\napproximation, with the inclusion of the two-body current, generated by the\ncross-ladder kernel, are computed. The valence wave function and\nelectromagnetic form factor, considering both ladder and ladder plus\ncross-ladder kernels, are studied in detail. Their asymptotic forms are found\nto be quite independent of the inclusion of the cross-ladder kernel, for a\ngiven binding energy. The asymptotic decrease of form factor agrees with the\ncounting rules. This analysis can be generalized to fermionic systems, with a\nwide application in the study of the meson structure.\n", "  The evolution of inflationary fluctuations can be recast as an inverse\nscattering problem. In this context, we employ the Gel'fand-Levitan method from\ninverse-scattering theory to reconstruct the evolution of both the inflaton\nfield freeze-out horizon and the Hubble parameter during inflation. We\ndemonstrate this reconstruction procedure numerically for a scenario of\nslow-roll inflation, as well as for a scenario which temporarily departs from\nslow-roll. The field freeze-out horizon is reconstructed from the accessible\nprimordial scalar power spectrum alone, while the reconstruction of the Hubble\nparameter requires additional information from the tensor power spectrum. We\nbriefly discuss the application of this technique to more realistic cases\nincorporating estimates of the primordial power spectra over limited ranges of\nscales and with specified uncertainties.\n", "  We have investigated the superconducting gap of optimally doped\nBa(Fe$_{0.65}$Ru$_{0.35}$)$_2$As$_2$ by angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (APRES) using bulk-sensitive 7 eV laser and synchrotron radiation.\nIt was found that the gap is isotropic in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane both on the\nelectron and hole Fermi surfaces (FSs). The gap magnitudes of two resolved hole\nFSs show similar $k_z$ dependences and decrease as $k_z$ approaches $\\sim$\n2$\\pi$/$c$ (i.e., around the Z point) unlike the other Fe-based superconductors\nreported so far, where the superconducting gap of only one hole FS shows a\nstrong $k_z$ dependence. This unique gap structure can be understood in the\nscenario that the $d_{z^2}$ orbital character is mixed into both hole FSs due\nto the finite spin-orbit coupling between almost degenerate FSs and is\nreproduced by calculations within the random phase approximation including the\nspin-orbit coupling.\n", "  The Gross Pitaevski map is a discrete time, split operator version of the\nGross Pitaevski dynamics in the circle, for which exponential instability has\nbeen recently reported. Here it is studied as a classical dynamical system in\nits own right. A systematic analysis of Lyapunov exponents exposes strongly\nchaotic behavior. Exponential growth of energy is then shown to be a direct\nconsequence of rotational invariance and for stationary solutions the full\nspectrum of Lyapunov exponents is analytically computed. The present analysis\nincludes the resonant case, when the free rotation period is commensurate to\n$2\\pi$, and the map has countably many constants of the motion. Except for\nlowest order resonances, this case exhibits an integrable-chaotic transition.\n", "  The Quantum renormalization group (QRG) is a realisation of holography\nthrough a coarse graining prescription that maps the beta functions of a\nquantum field theory thought to live on the `boundary' of some space to\nholographic actions in the `bulk' of this space. A consistency condition will\nbe proposed that translates into general covariance of the gravitational theory\nin the $D + 1$ dimensional bulk. This emerges from the application of the QRG\non a planar matrix field theory living on the $D$ dimensional boundary. This\nwill be a particular form of the Wess--Zumino consistency condition that the\ngenerating functional of the boundary theory needs to satisfy. In the bulk,\nthis condition forces the Poisson bracket algebra of the scalar and vector\nconstraints of the dual gravitational theory to close in a very specific\nmanner, namely, the manner in which the corresponding constraints of general\nrelativity do. A number of features of the gravitational theory will be fixed\nas a consequence of this form of the Poisson bracket algebra. In particular, it\nwill require the metric beta function to be of gradient form.\n", "  We study the Higgs boson $(h)$ decay to two light jets at the 14 TeV\nHigh-Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC), where a light jet ($j$) represents any non-flavor\ntagged jet from the observational point of view. The decay mode $h\\to gg$ is\nchosen as the benchmark since it is the dominant channel in the Standard Model\n(SM), but the bound obtained is also applicable to the light quarks\n$(j=u,d,s)$. We estimate the achievable bounds on the decay branching fractions\nthrough the associated production $Vh\\ (V=W^\\pm,Z)$. Events of the Higgs boson\ndecaying into heavy (tagged) or light (un-tagged) jets are correlatively\nanalyzed. We find that with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ data at the HL-LHC, we should expect\napproximately $1\\sigma$ statistical significance on the SM $Vh(gg)$ signal in\nthis channel. This corresponds to a reachable upper bound ${\\rm BR}(h\\to jj)\n\\leq 4~ {\\rm BR}^{SM}(h\\to gg)$ at $95\\%$ confidence level. A consistency fit\nalso leads to an upper bound ${\\rm BR}(h\\to cc) < 15~ {\\rm BR}^{SM}(h\\to cc)$\nat $95\\%$ confidence level. The estimated bound may be further strengthened by\nadopting multiple variable analyses, or adding other production channels.\n", "  We develop an effective medium theory for electromagnetic wave propagation\nthrough gapless non-uniform systems with dynamic chiral magnetic effect. The\ntheory allows to calculate macroscopic-disorder-induced corrections to the\nvalues of optical, as well as chiral magnetic conductivities. In particular, we\nshow that spatial fluctuations of optical conductivity induce corrections to\nthe effective value of the chiral magnetic conductivity. Experimentally, these\ncorrections can be observed as sharp features in the Faraday rotation angle\nnear frequencies that correspond to the bulk plasmon resonances of a material.\nSuch features are not expected to be present in single crystal samples.\n", "  The localization of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been hindered by the poor\nangular resolution of the detection observations and inconclusive\nidentification of transient or variable counterparts. Recently a $\\gamma$-ray\npulse of $380$ s duration has been associated with the fast radio burst FRB\n131104. We report on radio-continuum imaging observations of the original\nlocalization region of the FRB, beginning three days after the event and\ncomprising 25 epochs over 2.5 yr. Besides probabilistic arguments that suggest\nthat the association between the $\\gamma$-ray transient and the FRB is not\ncompelling, we provide upper limits on a putative radio afterglow of this\ntransient that are at odds with standard models for its progenitor. We further\nreport the discovery of an unusual variable radio source spatially and\ntemporally coincident with FRB 131104, but not spatially coincident with the\n$\\gamma$-ray event. The radio variable flares by a factor of $3$ above its long\nterm average within $10$ d of the FRB at 7.5 GHz, with a factor-of-$2$ increase\nat $5.5$ GHz. Within our observations, the variable has persisted with only\nmodest modulation and never approached the flux density observed in the days\nafter the FRB. We identify an optical counterpart to the variable. Optical and\ninfrared photometry, and deep optical spectroscopy, suggest that the object is\na narrow-line radio AGN.\n", "  We introduce a cluster extension of multipole moments to discuss the\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) in both ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) states in a unified framework. We first derive general symmetry\nrequirements for the AHE in the presence or absence of the spin-orbit coupling,\nby considering the symmetry of the Berry curvature in k space. The cluster\nmultipole (CMP) moments are then defined to quantify the macroscopic\nmagnetization in non-collinear AFM states, as a natural generalization of the\nmagnetization in FM states. We identify the macroscopic CMP order which induces\nthe AHE. The theoretical framework is applied to the non-collinear AFM states\nof Mn3Ir, for which an AHE was predicted in a first-principles calculation, and\nMn3Z (Z=Sn, Ge), for which a large AHE was recently discovered experimentally.\nWe further compare the AHE in Mn3Z and bcc Fe in terms of the CMP. We show that\nthe AHE in Mn3Z is characterized with the magnetization of a cluster octupole\nmoment in the same manner as that in bcc Fe characterized with the\nmagnetization of the dipole moment.\n", "  We perform nonlinear MHD simulations to study the propagation of\nmagnetoacoustic waves from the photosphere to the low corona. We focus on a 2D\nsystem with a gravitationally stratified atmosphere and three photospheric\nconcentrations of magnetic flux that give rise to a magnetic null point with a\nmagnetic dome topology. We find that a single wavepacket introduced at the\nlower boundary splits into multiple secondary wavepackets. A portion of the\npacket refracts towards the null due to the varying Alfv\\'en speed. Waves\nincident on the equipartition contour surrounding the null, where the sound and\nAlfv\\'en speeds coincide, partially transmit, reflect, and mode convert between\nbranches of the local dispersion relation. Approximately $15.5\\%$ of the\nwavepacket's initial energy ($E_{input}$) converges on the null, mostly as a\nfast magnetoacoustic wave. Conversion is very efficient: $70\\%$ of the energy\nincident on the null is converted to slow modes propagating away from the null,\n$7\\%$ leaves as a fast wave, and the remaining $23\\%$ (0.036$E_{input}$) is\nlocally dissipated. The acoustic energy leaving the null is strongly\nconcentrated along field lines near each of the null's four separatrices. The\nportion of the wavepacket that refracts towards the null, and the amount of\ncurrent accumulation, depends on the vertical and horizontal wavenumbers and\nthe centroid position of the wavepacket as it crosses the photosphere. Regions\nthat refract towards or away from the null do not simply coincide with regions\nof open versus closed magnetic field or the local field orientation. We also\nmodeled wavepacket propagation using a WKB method and found that it agrees\nqualitatively, though not quantitatively, with the results of the numerical\nsimulation.\n", "  If the flavor dependent non-standard interactions (NSI) in neutrino\npropagation exist, then the matter effect is modified and the modification is\nparametrized by the dimensionless parameter\n$\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}~(\\alpha,\\beta=e, \\mu, \\tau)$. In this paper we discuss\nthe sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment, whose possibility is now seriously\ndiscussed as a future extension of the T2K experiment, to such NSI. On the\nassumption that $\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu}=0~(\\alpha=e, \\mu\\tau)$ and\n$\\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau}=|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|/(1+\\epsilon_{ee})$, which are satisfied\nby other experiments to a good approximation, we find that, among the possible\noff-axis flux configurations of $1.3^\\circ$, $1.5^\\circ$, $2.0^\\circ$ and\n$2.5^\\circ$, the case of the off-axis angle $1.3^\\circ$ gives the highest\nsensitivity to $\\epsilon_{ee}$ and $|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|$. Our results show that\nthe $1.3^\\circ$ off-axis configuration can exclude NSI for\n$|\\epsilon_{ee}|\\gtrsim 1$ or $|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|\\gtrsim 0.2$ at 3$\\sigma$. We\nalso find that in the presence of NSI, T2HKK (for the off-axis angle\n$1.3^\\circ$) has better sensitivity to the two CP phases ($\\delta_{CP}$ and\narg($\\epsilon_{e \\tau}$)) than DUNE. This is because of the synergy between the\ntwo detectors i.e., one at Kamioka and one at Korea. T2HKK has better\nsensitivity to the CP phases than the atmospheric neutrino experiment at\nHyperkamiokande in inverted hierarchy, but in normal hierarchy the atmospheric\nneutrino experiment has the best sensitivity to the CP phases.\n", "  We propose that measurements of time-of-arrival correlations in multi-partite\nsystems can sharply distinguish between different approaches to the\ntime-of-arrival problem. To show this, we construct a Positive-Operator-Valued\nmeasure for two distinct time-of-arrival measurements in a bipartite system,\nand we prove that the resulting probabilities differ strongly from ones defined\nin terms of probability currents. We also prove that time-of-arrival\ncorrelations are entanglement witnesses, a result suggesting the use of\ntemporal observables for quantum information processing tasks. Finally, we\nconstruct the probabilities for sequential time-of-arrival measurements on a\nsingle particle. We derive the state-reduction rule for time-of-arrival\nmeasurements; it differs significantly from the standard one, because\ntime-of-arrival measurements are not defined at a single predetermined moment\nof time.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the linear stability of the Linet - Tian solution\nwith negative cosmological constant. In the limit of vanishing cosmological\nconstant the Linet - Tian metric reduces to a form of the Levi - Civita metric,\nand, therefore, it can be considered as a generalization of the former to\ninclude a cosmological constant. The gravitational instability of the Levi -\nCivita metric was recently established, and the purpose of this paper is to\ninvestigate what changes result from the introduction of a cosmological\nconstant. A fundamental difference brought about by a (negative) cosmological\nconstant is in the structure at infinity. This introduces an added problem in\nattempting to define an evolution for the perturbations because the constant\ntime hypersurfaces are not Cauchy surfaces. In this paper we show that under a\nlarge set of boundary conditions that lead to a unique evolution of the\nperturbations, we always find unstable modes, that would generically be present\nin the evolution of arbitrary initial data, leading to the conclusion that the\nLinet - Tian space times with negative cosmological constant are linearly\nunstable under gravitational perturbations.\n", "  We prove that the initial value problem for Force-free Electrodynamics in\nEuler variables is not well posed. We establish this result by showing that a\nwell-posedness criterion provided by Kreiss fails to hold for this theory, and\nusing a theorem provided by Strang. To show the nature of the problem we\ndisplay a particular bounded (in Sobolev norms) sequence of initial data for\nthe Force-free equations such that at any given time as close to zero as one\nwishes, the corresponding evolution sequence is not bounded. Thus, the\nForce-free evolution is non continuous in that norm with respect to the initial\ndata. We furthermore prove that this problem is also ill-posed in the\nLeray-Ohya sense.\n", "  We show how the classical action, an adiabatic invariant, can be preserved\nunder non-adiabatic conditions. Specifically, for a time-dependent Hamiltonian\n$H = p^2/2m + U(q,t)$ in one degree of freedom, and for an arbitrary choice of\naction $I_0$, we construct a \"fast-forward\" potential energy function $V_{\\rm\nFF}(q,t)$ that, when added to $H$, guides all trajectories with initial action\n$I_0$ to end with the same value of action. We use this result to construct a\nlocal dynamical invariant $J(q,p,t)$ whose value remains constant along these\ntrajectories. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations. Finally, we\nsketch how our classical results may be used to design approximate quantum\nshortcuts to adiabaticity.\n", "  In the lepton-specific version of two Higgs doublet models, a discrete\nsymmetry is used to couple one Higgs, $\\Phi_2$, to quarks and the other,\n$\\Phi_1$, to leptons. The symmetry eliminates tree level flavor changing\nneutral currents (FCNC). Motivated by strong constraints on such currents in\nthe quark sector from meson-antimeson mixing, and by hints of $h \\to \\mu\\tau$\nin the lepton sector, we study a simple three Higgs doublet model in which one\ndoublet couples to quarks and the other two to leptons. Unlike most other\nstudies of three Higgs doublet models, we impose no flavor symmetry and just\nuse a $Z_2$ symmetry to constrain the Yukawa couplings. We present the model\nand discuss the various mixing angles. Constraining the parameters to be\nconsistent with observations of the Higgs boson at the LHC, we study the\nproperties of the charged Higgs boson(s) in the model, focusing on the case in\nwhich the charged Higgs is above the top threshold. It is found that one can\nhave the branching fraction of the charged Higgs into $\\tau\\nu_\\tau$ comparable\nto $t\\bar{b}$ decay without needing very large values for the ratios of vevs.\nOne can also get a large branching fraction for the much more easily observable\n$\\mu\\nu_\\tau$ decay.\n", "  A new renormalization scheme is defined for fermion bilinears in QCD at non\nvanishing quark masses. This new scheme, denoted RI/mSMOM, preserves the\nbenefits of the nonexceptional momenta introduced in the RI/SMOM scheme, and\nallows a definition of renormalized composite fields away from the chiral\nlimit. Some properties of the scheme are investigated by performing explicit\none-loop computation in dimensional regularization.\n", "  Understanding how accretion proceeds in proto-planetary discs and more\ngenerally their dynamics is a crucial issue for explaining the conditions in\nwhich planets form. The role that accretion of gas from the surrounding\nmolecular cloud onto the disc may have on its structure needs to be quantified.\nWe perform tri-dimensional simulations using the Cartesian AMR code RAMSES of\nan accretion disc subject to infalling material. For the aspect ratio of $H/R\n\\simeq 0.15$ and disk mass $M_d \\simeq 10^{-2}$ M$_\\odot$ used in our study, we\nfind that for typical accretion rates on the order of a few 10$^{-7}$ M$_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$, values of the $\\alpha$ parameter as high as a few 10$^{-3}$ are\ninferred. The mass that is accreted in the inner part of the disc is typically\nat least $50\\%$ of the total mass that has been accreted onto the disc. Our\nresults suggest that external accretion of gas at moderate values, onto\ncircumstellar discs may trigger prominent spiral arms, reminiscent of recent\nobservations made with various instruments, and lead to significant transport\nthrough the disc. If confirmed from observational studies, such accretion may\ntherefore influence disc evolution.\n", "  Asymmetric mass ejection in the early phase of supernova (SN) explosions can\nimpart a kick velocity to the new-born neutron star (NS). For neutrino-driven\nexplosions the NS acceleration was shown to be mainly caused by the\ngravitational attraction of the anisotropically expelled inner ejecta, while\nhydrodynamic forces contribute on a subdominant level, and asymmetric neutrino\nemission plays only a secondary role. Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain\nthe observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s. Here, we\ndiscuss how the NS kick depends on the energy, ejecta mass, and asymmetry of\nthe SN explosion, and which role the compactness of the pre-collapse stellar\ncore plays for the momentum transfer to the NS. We also provide simple analytic\nexpressions for the NS velocity in terms of these quantities. Referring to\nresults of hydrodynamic simulations in the literature, we argue why within the\ndiscussed scenario of NS acceleration, electron-capture SNe, low-mass Fe-core\nSNe and ultra-stripped SNe can be expected to have considerably lower intrinsic\nNS kicks than core-collapse SNe of massive stellar cores. Our basic arguments\nremain valid also if progenitor stars possess large-scale asymmetries in their\nconvective silicon and oxygen burning layers. Possible scenarios for spin-kick\nalignment are sketched. Much of our discussion remains on a conceptual and\nqualitative level and more work is needed on the numerical modeling side to\ndetermine the dependences of involved parameters, whose prescriptions will be\nneeded for recipes that can be used to better describe NS kicks in binary\nevolution and population synthesis studies.\n", "  It has been suggested that non-relativistic outflows from quasars can\nnaturally account for the missing component of the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray\nbackground and explain the cumulative neutrino background through pion decay in\ncollisions between protons accelerated by the outflow shock and interstellar\nprotons. Here we show that the same quasar outflows are capable of accelerating\nprotons to energies of $\\sim 10^{20}$ eV during the early phase of their\npropagation. The overall quasar population is expected to produce a cumulative\nultra high energy cosmic ray flux of $\\sim10^{-7}\\,\\rm\nGeV\\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}$ at $E_{\\rm CR}\\gtrsim10^{18}$ eV. The spectral shape\nand amplitude is consistent with recent observations for outflow parameters\nconstrained to fit secondary $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos without any additional\nparameter tuning. This indicates that quasar outflows simultaneously account\nfor all three messengers at their observed levels.\n", "  We present systematic constructions of tensor-network wavefunctions for\nbosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases respecting both onsite and\nspatial symmetries. From the classification point of view, our results show\nthat in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, the cohomological bosonic SPT phases\nprotected by a general symmetry group $SG$ involving onsite and spatial\nsymmetries are classified by the cohomology group $H^{d+1}(SG,U(1))$, in which\nboth the time-reversal symmetry and mirror reflection symmetries should be\ntreated as anti-unitary operations. In addition, for every SPT phase protected\nby a discrete symmetry group and some SPT phases protected by continous\nsymmetry groups, generic tensor-network wavefunctions can be constructed which\nwould be useful for the purpose of variational numerical simulations. As a\nby-product, our results demonstrate a generic connection between rather\nconventional symmetry enriched topological phases and SPT phases via an anyon\ncondensation mechanism.\n", "  This paper presents 828 new 21 cm neutral hydrogen line measurements carried\nout with the FORT receiver of the meridian transit Nan\\c{c}ay radio telescope\n(NRT) in the years 2000 -- 2007. This observational program was part of a\nlarger project aimed at collecting an exhaustive and magnitude-complete HI\nextragalactic catalog for Tully-Fisher applications. Through five massive data\nreleases, the KLUN series has collected a homogeneous sample of 4876 HI-spectra\nof spiral galaxies, complete down to a flux of 5 Jy.km.s^{-1} and with\ndeclination delta > -40{\\deg}. We publish here the last release of the KLUN HI\nobservational program, corresponding to the faint end of the survey, with HI\nmasses ranging from 5 10^8 to 5 10^{10} solar masses. The size of this final\nsample is comparable to the catalogs based on the Arecibo and Parkes radio\ntelescope campaigns, and it allows general HI mass distribution studies from a\nset of homogeneous radio measurements.\n", "  We verify the finite time fluctuation theorem for a linear Ising chain at its\nends in contact with heat reservoirs. Analytic results are derived for a chain\nconsisting of only two spins. The system can be mapped onto a model for\nparticle transport, namely the symmetric exclusion process, in contact with\nthermal and particle reservoirs. We modify the symmetric exclusion process to\nrepresent a thermal engine and reproduce universal features of the efficiency\nat maximum power.\n", "  We consider transport properties of a two dimensional topological insulator\nin a double quantum point contact geometry in presence of a time-dependent\nexternal field. In the proposed setup an external gate is placed above a single\nconstriction and it couples only with electrons belonging to the top edge. This\nasymmetric configuration and the presence of an ac signal allow for a quantum\npumping mechanism, which, in turn, can generate finite heat and charge currents\nin an unbiased device configuration. A microscopic model for the coupling with\nthe external time-dependent gate potential is developed and the induced finite\nheat and charge currents are investigated. We demonstrate that in the\nnon-interacting case, heat flow is associated with a single spin component, due\nto the helical nature of the edge states, and therefore a finite and polarized\nheat current is obtained in this configuration. The presence of e-e\ninterchannel interactions strongly affects the current signal, lowering the\ndegree of polarization of the system. Finally, we also show that separate heat\nand charge flows can be achieved, varying the amplitude of the external gate.\n", "  We study the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ distribution amplitudes (DAs) in the context\nof a nonlocal SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R chiral quark model. The corresponding\nLagrangian allows to reproduce the phenomenological values of pseudoscalar\nmeson masses and decay constants, as well as the momentum dependence of the\nquark propagator arising from lattice calculations. It is found that the\nobtained DAs have two symmetric maxima, which arise from new contributions\ngenerated by the nonlocal character of the interactions. These DAs are then\napplied to the calculation of the $\\eta$-$\\gamma$ and $\\eta'$-$\\gamma$\ntransition form factors. Implications of our results regarding higher twist\ncorrections and/or contributions to the transition form factors originated by\ngluon-gluon components in the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ mesons are discussed.\n", "  Magnetic loops filled with hot plasma are the main building blocks of the\nsolar corona. Usually they have lengths of the order of the barometric scale\nheight in the corona that is 50 Mm. Previously it has been suggested that\nminiature versions of hot loops exist. These would have lengths of only 1 Mm\nbarely protruding from the chromosphere and spanning across just one granule in\nthe photosphere. Such short loops are well established at transition region\ntemperatures (0.1 MK), and we investigate if such miniature loops also exist at\ncoronal temperatures (>1 MK). We used extreme UV imaging (EUV) observations\nfrom the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) at an unprecedented spatial\nresolution of 0.3\" to 0.4\". Together with EUV imaging and magnetogram data from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and X-Ray Telescope (XRT) data from Hinode\nwe investigated the spatial, temporal and thermal evolution of small loop-like\nstructures in the solar corona above a plage region close to an active region\nand compared this to a moss area within the active region. We find that the\nsize, motion and temporal evolution of the loop-like features are consistent\nwith photospheric motions, suggesting a close connection to the photospheric\nmagnetic field. Aligned magnetograms show that one of their endpoints is rooted\nat a magnetic concentration. Their thermal structure, as revealed together with\nthe X-ray observations, shows significant differences to moss-like features.\nConsidering different scenarios, these features are most probably miniature\nversions of hot loops rooted at magnetic concentrations at opposite sides of a\ngranule in small emerging magnetic loops (or flux tubes).\n", "  Hydrogen recombination emission lines commonly observed in accreting young\nstellar objects represent a powerful tracer for the gas conditions in the\ncircumstellar structures. Here we perform a study of the HI decrements and line\nprofiles, from the Balmer and Paschen lines detected in the X-Shooter spectra\nof a homogeneous sample of 36 T Tauri stars in Lupus, the accretion and stellar\nproperties of which were already derived in a previous work. We aim to obtain\ninformation on the gas physical conditions to derive a consistent picture of\nthe HI emission mechanisms in pre-main sequence low-mass stars. We have\nempirically classified the sources based on their HI line profiles and\ndecrements. We identified four Balmer decrement types (classified as 1, 2, 3,\nand 4) and three Paschen decrement types (A, B, and C), characterised by\ndifferent shapes. We first discussed the connection between the decrement types\nand the source properties and then compared the observed decrements with\npredictions from recently published local line excitation models. One third of\nthe objects show lines with narrow symmetric profiles, and present similar\nBalmer and Paschen decrements (straight decrements, types 2 and A). Lines in\nthese sources are consistent with optically thin emission from gas with\nhydrogen densities of order 10^9 cm^-3 and 5000<T<15000 K. These objects are\nassociated with low mass accretion rates. Type 4 (L-shaped) Balmer and type B\nPaschen decrements are found in conjunction with very wide line profiles and\nare characteristic of strong accretors, with optically thick emission from\nhigh-density gas (log n_H > 11 cm^-3). Type 1 (curved) Balmer decrements are\nobserved only in three sub-luminous sources viewed edge-on, so we speculate\nthat these are actually reddened type 2 decrements. About 20% of the objects\npresent type 3 Balmer decrements (bumpy), which cannot be reproduced with\ncurrent models.\n", "  A new class of universal \"three-body\" bound states has been recently\npredicted theoretically for identical fermions interacting at p-wave resonance\nin two dimensions. This phenomenon is called the super Efimov effect since the\nbinding energies of the states follow a intriguing double exponential scaling.\nHowever, experimental resolution of this scaling is expected to meet formidable\nchallenges. In this work, we introduce a new thermodynamic quantity, the\nthree-body contact $C_\\theta$, to quantify three-body correlations in a two\ndimensional gas composed of the resonantly interacting fermions; the contact\n$C_\\theta$ is the consequence of the underlying universal super Efimov effect\nin the many-body context. We show how $C_\\theta$ affects physical observables\nsuch as the radio-frequency spectrum, the momentum distribution and the atom\nloss rate. Signature of the elusive super Efimov effect in the thermodynamic\nsystem can be pinned down by the detection of the three-body contact $C_\\theta$\nvia these observables.\n", "  We present forecasts for cosmological parameters from future Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) data measured by the Stage-4 (S4) generation of ground-based\nexperiments in combination with large-scale anisotropy data from the PIXIE\nsatellite. We demonstrate the complementarity of the two experiments and focus\non science targets that benefit from their combination. We show that a\ncosmic-variance-limited measurement of the optical depth to reionization\nprovided by PIXIE, with error $\\sigma(\\tau)=0.002$, is vital for enabling a\n5$\\sigma$ detection of the sum of the neutrino masses when combined with a\nCMB-S4 lensing measurement, and with lower-redshift constraints on the growth\nof structure and the distance-redshift relation. Parameters characterizing the\nepoch of reionization will also be tightly constrained; PIXIE's $\\tau$\nconstraint converts into $\\sigma(\\rm{z_{re}})=0.2$ for the mean time of\nreionization, and a kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurement from S4 gives\n$\\sigma(\\Delta \\rm{z_{re}})=0.03$ for the duration of reionization. Both PIXIE\nand S4 will put strong constraints on primordial tensor fluctuations, vital for\ntesting early-universe models, and will do so at distinct angular scales. We\nforecast $\\sigma(r)\\approx 5\\times10^{-4}$ for a signal with a tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r=10^{-3}$, after accounting for diffuse foreground removal and\nde-lensing. The wide and dense frequency coverage of PIXIE results in an\nexpected foreground-degradation factor on $r$ of only $\\approx$25%. By\nmeasuring large and small scales PIXIE and S4 will together better limit the\nenergy injection at recombination from dark matter annihilation, with $p_{\\rm\nann}<0.09 \\times 10^{-6} \\ {\\rm m^3/s/Kg}$ projected at 95% confidence.\nCosmological parameters measured from the damping tail with S4 will be best\nconstrained by polarization, which has the advantage of minimal contamination\nfrom extragalactic emission.\n", "  We investigate the interaction of spin-2 fields with those of Standard Model\nin a model independent framework. We have considered interactions where the\nspin-2 fields couple to two sets of gauge invariant tensorial operators that\nare not conserved unlike the energy momentum tensor with different coupling\nstrengths. Such interactions not only change the ultraviolet behaviour of the\ncouplings but also expand the scope of the searches of spin-2 particles at the\ncolliders. We present all the relevant renormalisation constants up to three\nloop level in QCD and also the form factors that contribute to potential\nobservables. This sets the ground to investigate the phenomenological\nconsequences of these interactions with spin-2 fields through more than one\ntensorial operator.\n", "  Collider signals of dark photons are an exciting probe for new gauge forces\nand are characterized by events with boosted lepton jets. Existing techniques\nare efficient in searching for muonic lepton jets but due to substantial\nbackgrounds have difficulty constraining lepton jets containing only electrons.\nThis is unfortunate since upcoming intensity frontier experiments are sensitive\nto dark photon masses which only allow electron decays. Analyzing a recently\nproposed model of kinetic mixing, with new scalar particles decaying into dark\nphotons, we find that existing techniques for electron jets can be\nsubstantially improved. We show that using lepton-jet-substructure variables,\nin association with a boosted decision tree, improves background rejection,\nsignificantly increasing the LHC's reach for dark photons in this region of\nparameter space.\n", "  We revisit the action principle for general relativity motivated by the path\nintegral approach to quantum gravity. We consider a spacetime region whose\nboundary has piecewise $C^2$ components, each of which can be spacelike,\ntimelike or null and consider metric variations in which only the pullback of\nthe metric to the boundary is held fixed. Allowing all such metric variations\nwe present a unified treatment of the spacelike, timelike and null boundary\ncomponents using Cartan's tetrad formalism. Apart from its computational\nsimplicity, this formalism gives us a simple way of identifying corner terms.\nWe also discuss \"creases\" which occur when the boundary is the event horizon of\na black hole. Our treatment is geometric and intrinsic and we present our\nresults both in the computationally simpler tetrad formalism as well as the\nmore familiar metric formalism. We recover known results from a simpler and\nmore general point of view and find some new ones.\n", "  The aim of this work is to provide a precise and accurate measurement of the\n238U(n,g) reaction cross section in the energy region from 1 eV to 700 keV.\nThis reaction is of fundamental importance for the design calculations of\nnuclear reactors, governing the behaviour of the reactor core. In particular,\nfast reactors, which are experiencing a growing interest for their ability to\nburn radioactive waste, operate in the high energy region of the neutron\nspectrum. In this energy region most recent evaluations disagree due to\ninconsistencies in the existing measurements of up to 15%. In addition, the\nassessment of nuclear data uncertainty performed for innovative reactor systems\nshows that the uncertainty in the radiative capture cross-section of 238U\nshould be further reduced to 1-3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV. To\nthis purpose, addressed by the Nuclear Energy Agency as a priority nuclear data\nneed, complementary experiments, one at the GELINA and two at the n_TOF\nfacility, were proposed and carried out within the 7th Framework Project ANDES\nof the European Commission.\n  The results of one of these 238U(n,g) measurements performed at the n_TOF\nCERN facility are presented in this work. The gamma-ray cascade following the\nradiative neutron capture has been detected exploiting a setup of two C6D6\nliquid scintillators. Resonance parameters obtained from this work are on\naverage in excellent agreement with the ones reported in evaluated libraries.\nIn the unresolved resonance region, this work yields a cross section in\nagreement with evaluated libraries up to 80 keV, while for higher energies our\nresults are significantly higher.\n", "  We present a theory of parametric mixing within the coplanar waveguide (CPW)\nof a superconducting nonlinear kinetic-inductance traveling-wave (KIT)\namplifier engineered with periodic dispersion loadings. This is done by first\ndeveloping a metamaterial band theory of the dispersion-engineered KIT using a\nFloquet-Bloch construction and then applying it to the description of mixing of\nthe nonlinear RF traveling waves. Our theory allows us to calculate signal gain\nvs. signal frequency in the presence of a frequency stop gap, based solely on\nloading design. We present results for both three-wave mixing (3WM), with\napplied DC bias, and four-wave mixing (4WM), without DC. Our theory predicts an\nintrinsic and deterministic origin to undulations of 4WM signal gain with\nsignal frequency, apart from extrinsic sources, such as impedance mismatch, and\nshows that such undulations are absent from 3WM signal gain achievable with DC.\nOur theory is extensible to amplifiers based on Josephson junctions in a lumped\nLC transmission line (TWPA).\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of the lepton flavour and number violating\nconversion of bound muons into positrons. This process is a viable alternative\nto neutrinoless double beta decay and, given that experiments on ordinary\n$\\mu^-$- $e^-$ conversion are expected to improve their sensitivities by\nseveral orders of magnitude in the coming years, we can also assume the limit\non $\\mu^-$- $e^+$ conversion to improve by roughly the same factor. We discuss\nhow new physics at a high scale can lead to short-range contributions to this\nconversion process and we present one explicit case in great detail (the single\none for which the corresponding nuclear matrix element is presently known). The\nmain goal of our discussion is to make the respective computation accessible to\nthe particle physics community, so that promising models can be investigated\nwhile the nuclear physics community can simultaneously advance the computation\nof nuclear matrix elements. Given the progress to be expected on the\nexperimental side, it may even be possible that lepton number violation in the\n$e\\mu$-sector is discovered by $\\mu^-$- $e^+$ conversion before neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay can show its existence in the $ee$-sector.\n", "  With the recent discovery of Gravitational waves, marking the start of the\nnew field of GW astronomy, the push for building more sensitive\nlaser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors (GWD) has never been\nstronger. Balanced homodyne detection (BHD) allows for a quantum noise limited\nreadout of arbitrary light field quadratures, and has therefore been suggested\nas a vital building block for upgrades to Advanced LIGO and third generation\nobservatories. In terms of the practical implementation of BHD, we develop a\nfull framework for analyzing the static optical high order modes (HOMs)\noccurring in the BHD paths related to the misalignment or mode matching at the\ninput and output ports of the laser interferometer. We find the effects of HOMs\non the quantum noise limited sensitivity is independent of the actual\ninterferometer configuration, e.g. Michelson and Sagnac interferometers are\neffected in the same way. We show that output misalignment only effects the\nhigh frequency part of the quantum noise limited sensitivity. However, at low\nfrequencies, HOMs reduce the interferometer response and the radiation pressure\nnoise by the same amount and hence the quantum noise limited sensitivity is not\nnegatively effected. We show that the input misalignment to the interferometer\nproduces the same effect as output misalignment and additionally decreases the\npower inside the interferometer. We also analyze dynamic HOM effects, such as\nbeam jitter created by the suspended mirrors of the BHD. Our analyses can be\ndirectly applied to any BHD implementation in a future GWD. Moreover, we apply\nour analytical techniques to the example of the speed meter proof of concept\nexperiment under construction in Glasgow. We find that for our experimental\nparameters, the performance of our seismic isolation system in the BHD paths is\ncompatible with the design sensitivity of the experiment.\n", "  Measurement of 4-particle symmetric cumulants has been considered to be a\ngood tool to study the correlations between amplitudes of different orders of\nanisotropic flow harmonics in the heavy-ion collision. These new observables\nnot yet been measured at RHIC. Using A Multi-Phase Transport model, a set of\npredictions for the centrality dependence of the normalized 4-particle\nsymmetric cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV has been\ngiven. In addition, the effects of shear viscosity and hadronic rescattering on\nthe magnitude of symmetric cumulants are discussed using AMPT model at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. It is shown that $sc(2,3)$ is found to be more\nsensitive to hadronic rescattering, whereas $sc(2,4)$ is more sensitive to the\nshear viscosity. Rapidity dependence of symmetric cumulants is also shown. A\nrelation between symmetric cumulant and event plane correlation is investigated\nusing AMPT model.\n", "  We propose to combine a mean field approach with all atom molecular dynamics\ninto a multistage algorithm that can model protein folding and dynamics over\nvery long time periods yet with atomic level precision. As an example we\ninvestigate an isolated monomeric Myc oncoprotein that has been implicated in\ncarcinomas including those in colon, breast and lungs. Under physiological\nconditions a monomeric Myc is presumed to be an example of intrinsically\ndisordered proteins, that pose a serious challenge to existing modelling\ntechniques. We argue that a room temperature monomeric Myc is in a dynamical\nstate, it oscillates between different conformations that we identify. For this\nwe adopt the C-alpha backbone of Myc in a crystallographic heteromer as an\ninitial Ansatz for the monomeric structure. We construct a multisoliton of the\npertinent Landau free energy, to describe the C-alpha profile with ultra high\nprecision. We use Glauber dynamics to resolve how the multisoliton responds to\nrepeated increases and decreases in ambient temperature. We confirm that the\ninitial structure is unstable in isolation. We reveal a highly degenerate\nground state landscape, an attractive set towards which Glauber dynamics\nconverges in the limit of vanishing ambient temperature. We analyse the thermal\nstability of this Glauber attractor using room temperature molecular dynamics.\nWe identify and scrutinise a particularly stable subset in which the two\nhelical segments of the original multisoliton align in parallel, next to each\nother. During the MD time evolution of a representative structure from this\nsubset, we observe intermittent quasiparticle oscillations along the C-terminal\nalpha-helix, some of which resemble a translating Davydov's Amide-I soliton. We\npropose that the presence of oscillatory motion is in line with the expected\nintrinsically disordered character of Myc.\n", "  Feedback from central supermassive blackholes is often invoked to explain the\nlow star formation rates in massive galaxies at the centers of galaxy clusters.\nHowever, the detailed physics of the coupling of the injected feedback energy\nwith the intracluster medium is still unclear. Using high-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation, we\ninvestigate the role of anisotropic thermal conduction in shaping the\nthermodynamic structure of clusters, and, in particular, in modifying the\nimpact of black hole feedback. Stratified anisotropically conducting plasmas\nare formally always unstable, and thus more prone to mixing, an expectation\nborne out by our results. The increased mixing efficiently isotropizes the\ninjected feedback energy which in turn significantly improves the coupling\nbetween the feedback energy and the intracluster medium. This facilitates an\nearlier disruption of the cool core, reduces the star formation rate by more\nthan an order of magnitude, and results in earlier quenching despite an overall\nlower amount of feedback energy injected into the cluster core. With\nconduction, the metallicity gradients and dispersions are lowered, aligning\nthem better with observational constraints. These results highlight the\nimportant role of thermal conduction in establishing and maintaining quiescence\nof massive galaxies.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is nearing its launch date of 2018, and\nwill undoubtedly revolutionize our knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres. While\nseveral studies have explored what the limits of the telescope will be in terms\nof exoplanet characterization, less has been done to specifically identify\nwhich observing modes will be most useful for characterizing a diverse range of\nexoplanetary atmospheres. We use an information content based approach commonly\nused in the studies of Solar System atmospheres. We develop a system based upon\nthese information content methods to trace the instrumental and atmospheric\nmodel phase space in order to identify which observing modes are best suited\nfor particular classes of planets, focusing on transmission spectra.\nSpecifically, the atmospheric parameter space we cover is T=600-1800 K,\nC/O=0.55-1, [M/H]=1-100$\\times$Solar for a R=1.39 R$_J$, M=0.59 M$_J$ planet\norbiting WASP-62-like star. We find that obtaining broader wavelength coverage\nover multiple modes is preferred over higher precision in a single mode given\nthe same amount of observing time. Regardless of the planet temperature and\ncomposition, the best modes for constraining terminator temperatures, C/O\nratios, and metalicity are NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. If the target's host star\nis dim enough such that the NIRSpec prism can be used, then it cam be used\ninstead of NIRISS SOSS+NIRSpec G395. Lastly, observations that use more than\ntwo modes, should be carefully analyzed because sometimes the addition of a\nthird mode results in no gain of information. In these cases, higher precision\nin the original two modes is favorable.\n", "  The velocity distribution of galaxies in clusters is not universal; rather,\ngalaxies are segregated according to their spectral type and relative\nluminosity. We examine the velocity distributions of different populations of\ngalaxies within 89 Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters spanning $\n0.28 < z < 1.08$. Our sample is primarily draw from the SPT-GMOS spectroscopic\nsurvey, supplemented by additional published spectroscopy, resulting in a final\nspectroscopic sample of 4148 galaxy spectra---2868 cluster members. The\nvelocity dispersion of star-forming cluster galaxies is $17\\pm4$% greater than\nthat of passive cluster galaxies, and the velocity dispersion of bright ($m <\nm^{*}-0.5$) cluster galaxies is $11\\pm4$% lower than the velocity dispersion of\nour total member population. We find good agreement with simulations regarding\nthe shape of the relationship between the measured velocity dispersion and the\nfraction of passive vs. star-forming galaxies used to measure it, but we find a\nsmall offset between this relationship as measured in data and simulations in\nwhich suggests that our dispersions are systematically low by as much as 3\\%\nrelative to simulations. We argue that this offset could be interpreted as a\nmeasurement of the effective velocity bias that describes the ratio of our\nobserved velocity dispersions and the intrinsic velocity dispersion of dark\nmatter particles in a published simulation result. Measuring velocity bias in\nthis way suggests that large spectroscopic surveys can improve dispersion-based\nmass-observable scaling relations for cosmology even in the face of velocity\nbiases, by quantifying and ultimately calibrating them out.\n", "  For the first time accurate pulsation properties of the ancient variable\nstars of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) are discussed in the broad\ncontext of galaxy formation and evolution. Homogeneous multi-band $BVI$ optical\nphotometry of spanning {\\it twenty} years has allowed us to identify and\ncharacterize more than 1400 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in this galaxy. Roughly 70\\%\nare new discoveries. We investigate the period-amplitude distribution and find\nthat Fornax shows a lack of High Amplitude (A$_V\\gsim$0.75 mag) Short Period\nfundamental-mode RRLs (P$\\lsim$0.48 d, HASPs). These objects occur in stellar\npopulations more metal-rich than [Fe/H]$\\sim$-1.5 and they are common in the\nGalactic halo (Halo) and in globulars. This evidence suggests that old (age\nolder than 10 Gyr) Fornax stars are relatively metal-poor.\n  A detailed statistical analysis of the role of the present-day Fornax dSph in\nreproducing the Halo period distribution shows that it can account for only a\nfew to 20\\% of the Halo when combined with RRLs in massive dwarf galaxies\n(Sagittarius dSph, Large Magellanic Cloud). This finding indicates that\nFornax-like systems played a minor role in building up the Halo when compared\nwith massive dwarfs. We also discuss the occurrence of HASPs in connection with\nthe luminosity and the early chemical composition of nearby dwarf galaxies. We\nfind that, independently of their individual star formation histories, bright\n(M$_V\\lsim$-13.5 mag) galaxies have HASPs, whereas faint ones (M$_V\\gsim$-11\nmag) do not. Interestingly enough, Fornax belongs to a luminosity range\n(--11$<$M$_V<$--13.5 mag) in which the occurrence of HASPs appears to be\ncorrelated with the early star formation and chemical enrichment of the host\ngalaxy.\n", "  The photochemistry of ices with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has\nbeen extensively studied, but to date no investigation has been made of PAHs in\ninteraction with low numbers (n < 4) of molecules of water. We performed\nphotochemical matrix isolation studies of coronene:water complexes, probing the\nargon matrix with FTIR spectroscopy. We find that coronene readily reacts with\nwater upon irradiation with a mercury vapour lamp to produce oxygenated PAH\nphotoproducts, and we postulate a reaction mechanism via a charge transfer\nRydberg state. This result suggests that oxygenated PAHs should be widely\nobserved in regions of the ISM with sufficiently high water abundances, for\nexample near the edges of molecular clouds where water molecules begin to form,\nbut before icy layers are observed, that is at AV <3. In order to explain the\nlow derived observational abundances of oxygenated PAHs, additional destruction\nroutes must be invoked.\n", "  In the heavy-fermion metal CePdAl long-range antiferromagnetic order coexists\nwith geometric frustration of one third of the Ce moments. At low temperatures\nthe Kondo effect tends to screen the frustrated moments. We use magnetic fields\n$B$ to suppress the Kondo screening and study the magnetic phase diagram and\nthe evolution of the entropy with $B$ employing thermodynamic probes. We\nestimate the frustration by introducing a definition of the frustration\nparameter based on the enhanced entropy, a fundamental feature of frustrated\nsystems. In the field range where the Kondo screening is suppressed the\nliberated moments tend to maximize the magnetic entropy and strongly enhance\nthe frustration. Based on our experiments, this field range may be a promising\ncandidate to search for a quantum spin liquid.\n", "  Result on the locations of the tricritical points of $N_f=2$ lattice QCD with\nimaginary chemical potential is presented. Simulations are carried out with\nSymanzik improved gauge action and Asqtad fermion action. With imaginary\nchemical potential $i\\mu_I=i\\pi T$, previous studies show that the\nRoberge-Weiss (RW) transition endpoints are triple points at both large and\nsmall quark masses, and second order transition points at intermediate quark\nmasses. The triple and second order endpoints are separated by two tricritical\nones. Our simulations are carried out at 7 values of quark mass $am$ ranging\nfrom 0.024 to 0.070 on lattice volume $12^3\\times 4, 16^3\\times 4,\\,\n20^3\\times4$. The susceptibility and Binder cumulant of the imaginary part of\nPolyakov loop are employed to determine the nature of RW transition endpoints.\nThe simulations suggest that the two tricritical points are within the range\n$0.024-0.026$ and $0.040-0.050$, respectively.\n", "  We examine Simplified Models in which fermionic DM interacts with Standard\nModel (SM) fermions via the exchange of an $s$-channel scalar mediator. The\nsingle-mediator version of this model is not gauge invariant, and instead we\nmust consider models with two scalar mediators which mix and interfere. The\nminimal gauge invariant scenario involves the mixing of a new singlet scalar\nwith the Standard Model Higgs boson, and is tightly constrained. We construct\ntwo Higgs doublet model (2HDM) extensions of this scenario, where the singlet\nmixes with the 2nd Higgs doublet. Compared with the one doublet model, this\nprovides greater freedom for the masses and mixing angle of the scalar\nmediators, and their coupling to SM fermions. We outline constraints on these\nmodels, and discuss Yukawa structures that allow enhanced couplings, yet keep\npotentially dangerous flavour violating process under control. We examine the\ndirect detection phenomenology of these models, accounting for interference of\nthe scalar mediators, and interference of different quarks in the nucleus.\nRegions of parameter space consistent with direct detection measurements are\ndetermined.\n", "  The detection and characterisation of Earth-like planets with Doppler signals\nof the order of 1 m/s currently represent one of the greatest challenge for\nextrasolar-planet hunters. As results for such findings are often\ncontroversial, it is desirable to provide independent confirmations of the\ndiscoveries. Testing different models for the suppression of non-Keplerian\nstellar signals usually plaguing radial velocity data is essential to ensuring\nfindings are robust and reproducible. Using an alternative treatment of the\nstellar noise to that discussed in the discovery paper, we re-analyse the\nradial velocity dataset that led to the detection of a candidate terrestrial\nplanet orbiting the star Proxima Centauri. We aim to confirm the existence of\nthis outstanding planet, and test the existence of a second planetary signal.\nOur technique jointly modelled Keplerian signals and residual correlated\nsignals in radial velocities using Gaussian processes. We analysed only radial\nvelocity measurements without including other ancillary data in the fitting\nprocedure. In a second step, we have compared our outputs with results coming\nfrom photometry, to provide a consistent physical interpretation. Our analysis\nwas performed in a Bayesian framework to quantify the robustness of our\nfindings. We show that the correlated noise can be successfully modelled as a\nGaussian process regression, and contains a periodic term modulated on the\nstellar rotation period and characterised by an evolutionary timescale of the\norder of one year. Both findings appear to be robust when compared with results\nobtained from archival photometry, thus providing a reliable description of the\nnoise properties. We confirm the existence of a coherent signal described by a\nKeplerian orbit equation that can be attributed to the planet Proxima b [...]\n", "  Theories of gravity in the beyond Horndeski class encompass a wide range of\nscalar-tensor theories that will be tested on cosmological scales over the\ncoming decade. In this work, we investigate the possibility of testing them in\nthe strong-field regime by looking at the properties of compact\nobjects-neutron, hyperon, and quark stars-embedded in an asymptotically de\nSitter space-time, for a specific subclass of theories. We extend previous\nworks to include slow rotation and find a relation between the dimensionless\nmoment of intertia, ($\\bar{I}=Ic^2/G_{\\rm N} M^3$), and the compactness,\n$\\cal{C}=G_{\\rm N} M/Rc^2$ (an $\\bar{I}$-$\\cal{C}$ relation), independent of\nthe equation of state, that is reminiscent of but distinct from the general\nrelativity prediction. Several of our equations of state contain hyperons and\nfree quarks, allowing us to revisit the hyperon puzzle. We find that the\nmaximum mass of hyperon stars can be larger than $2M_\\odot$ for small values of\nthe beyond Horndeski parameter, thus providing a resolution of the hyperon\npuzzle based on modified gravity. Moreover, stable quark stars exist when\nhyperonic stars are unstable, which means that the phase transition from\nhyperon to quark stars is predicted just as in general relativity, albeit with\nlarger quark star masses. Two important and potentially observable consequences\nof some of the theories we consider are the existence of neutron stars in a\nrange of masses significantly higher than in GR, and $\\bar{I}$-$\\mathcal{C}$\nrelations that differ from their GR counterparts. In the former case, we find\nobjects that, if observed, could not be accounted for in GR because they\nviolate the usual GR causality condition. We end by discussing several\ndifficult technical issues that remain to be addressed in order to reach more\nrealistic predictions that may be tested using gravitational wave searches or\nneutron star observations.\n", "  In this paper we present a thorough study of transport, spectral and\nwave-function properties at the Anderson localization critical point in spatial\ndimensions $d = 3$, $4$, $5$, $6$. Our aim is to analyze the dimensional\ndependence and to asses the role of the $d\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit provided by\nBethe lattices and tree-like structures. Our results strongly suggest that the\nupper critical dimension of Anderson localization is infinite. Furthermore, we\nfind that the $d_U=\\infty$ is a much better starting point compared to $d_L=2$\nto describe even three dimensional systems. We find that critical properties\nand finite size scaling behavior approach by increasing $d$ the ones found for\nBethe lattices: the critical state becomes an insulator characterized by\nPoisson statistics and corrections to the thermodynamics limit become\nlogarithmic in $N$. In the conclusion, we present physical consequences of our\nresults, propose connections with the non-ergodic delocalised phase suggested\nfor the Anderson model on infinite dimensional lattices and discuss\nperspectives for future research studies.\n", "  Based on the collective linear and nonlinear processes in a magnetized plasma\nsurrounding the black hole at the galactic center (GC), an acceleration\nmechanism is proposed to explain the recent detection/discovery of PeV protons.\nIn a two stage process, the gravitation energy is first converted to the\nelectrical energy in fast growing Langmuir waves, and then the electrical\nenergy is transformed to the particle kinetic energy through Landau damping of\nwaves. It is shown that, for the characteristics parameters of GC plasma,\nproton energy can be boosted upto 5PeV.\n", "  Based on previous studies in a single particle system in both the integrable\n[Jarzynski, Quan, and Rahav, Phys.~Rev.~X {\\bf 5}, 031038 (2015)] and the\nchaotic systems [Zhu, Gong, Wu, and Quan, Phys.~Rev.~E {\\bf 93}, 062108\n(2016)], we study the the correspondence principle between quantum and\nclassical work distributions in a quantum many-body system. Even though the\ninteraction and the indistinguishability of identical particles increase the\ncomplexity of the system, we find that for a quantum many-body system the\ncumulative quantum work distribution still converges to its classical\ncounterpart in the semiclassical limit. Our results imply that there exists a\ncorrespondence principle between quantum and classical work distributions in an\ninteracting quantum many-body system, especially in the large particle number\nlimit, and further justify the definition of quantum work via two point energy\nmeasurements in quantum many-body systems.\n", "  We present an analysis of the diffuse ultraviolet (UV) emission near the\nTaurus Molecular Cloud based on observations made by the Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer (GALEX). We used a Monte Carlo dust scattering model to show that\nabout half of the scattered flux originates in the molecular cloud with 25%\narising in the foreground and 25% behind the cloud. The best-fit albedo of the\ndust grains is 0.3 but the geometry is such that we could not constrain the\nphase function asymmetry factor (g).\n", "  Solar chromospheric fibrils, as observed in the core of strong chromospheric\nspectral lines, extend from photospheric field concentrations suggesting that\nthey trace magnetic field lines. These images have been historically used as\nproxies of magnetic fields for many purposes. We use a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodel to analyze several tens of thousands of pixels in spectro-polarimetric\nchromospheric images of penumbrae and chromospheric fibrils. We compare the\nalignment between the field azimuth inferred from the linear polarization\nsignals through the transverse Zeeman effect and the direction of the fibrils\nin the image. We conclude that, in the analyzed fields of view, fibrils are\noften well aligned with the magnetic field azimuth. Despite this alignment, the\nanalysis also shows that there is a non-negligible dispersion. In penumbral\nfilaments, we find a dispersion with a standard deviation of ~16 degrees, while\nthis dispersion goes up to ~34 degrees in less magnetized regions.\n", "  We consider optical systems where propagation of light can be described by a\nDirac-like equation with $PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian. In order to construct\nexactly solvable configurations, we extend the confluent Crum-Darboux\ntransformation for the one-dimensional Dirac equation. The properties of the\nassociated intertwining operators are discussed and the explicit form for\nhigher-order transformations is presented. We utilize the results to derive a\nmulti-parametric class of exactly solvable systems where the balanced gain and\nloss represented by the $PT$-symmetric refractive index can imply localization\nof the electric field in the material.\n", "  Pulsators on and near the main sequence show period and amplitude changes\nthat are too large to be the product of stellar evolution. The multiperiodic\nDelta Scuti stars are well suited to study these changes. This requires a very\nlarge amount of photometric data covering years and decades as well as mode\nidentifications. We have examined over 800 nights of high-precision photometry\nof the multiperiodic pulsator 4 CVn obtained from 1966 through 2012. Because\nmost of the data were obtained in adjacent observing seasons, it is possible to\nderive very accurate period values for a number of the excited pulsation modes\nand to study their systematic changes from 1974 to 2012. Most pulsation modes\nshow systematic significant period and amplitude changes on a timescale of\ndecades. For the well-studied modes, around 1986 a general reversal of the\ndirections of both the positive and negative period changes occurred.\nFurthermore, the period changes between the different modes are strongly\ncorrelated, although they differ in size and sign. For the modes with known\nvalues of the spherical degree and azimuthal order, we find a correlation\nbetween the direction of the period changes and the identified azimuthal order,\nm. The associated amplitude changes generally have similar timescales of years\nor decades, but show little systematic or correlated behavior from mode to\nmode. A natural explanation for the opposite behavior of the prograde and\nretrograde modes is that their period changes are driven by a changing rotation\nprofile. The changes in the rotation profile could in turn be driven by\nprocesses, perhaps the pulsations themselves, that redistribute angular\nmomentum within the star. In general, different modes have different rotation\nkernels, so this will produce period shifts of varying magnitude for different\nmodes.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study focussing on the\nquantum tunneling of atoms in the reaction between CH4 and OH. The importance\nof this reaction pathway is derived by investigating isotope substituted\nanalogs. Quantitative reaction rates needed for astrochemical models at low\ntemperature are currently unavailable both in the solid state and in the gas\nphase. Here, we study tunneling effects upon hydrogen abstraction in CH4 + OH\nby focusing on two reactions: CH4 + OD -> CH3 + HDO and CD4 + OH -> CD3 + HDO.\nThe experimental study shows that the solid-state reaction rate R(CH4 + OD) is\nhigher than R(CD4 + OH) at 15 K. Experimental results are accompanied by\ncalculations of the corresponding unimolecular and bimolecular reaction rate\nconstants using instanton theory taking into account surface effects. From the\nwork presented here, the unimolecular reactions are particularly interesting as\nthese provide insight into reactions following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood process.\nThe resulting ratio of the rate constants shows that the H abstraction (k(CH4 +\nOD)) is approximately ten times faster than D-abstraction (k(CD4 + OH)) at 65\nK. We conclude that tunneling is involved at low temperatures in the\nabstraction reactions studied here. The unimolecular rate constants can be used\nby the modeling community as a first approach to describe OH-mediated\nabstraction reactions in the solid phase. For this reason we provide fits of\nour calculated rate constants that allow the inclusion of these reactions in\nmodels in a straightforward fashion.\n", "  We revisit the problem of deriving the mean-field values of avalanche\ncritical exponents in systems with absorbing states. These are well-known to\ncoincide with those of an un-biased branching process. Here, we show that for\nat least 4 different universality classes (directed percolation, dynamical\npercolation, the voter model or compact directed percolation class, and the\nManna class of stochastic sandpiles) this common result can be obtained by\nmapping the corresponding Langevin equations describing each of these classes\ninto a random walker confined close to the origin by a logarithmic potential.\nMany of the results derived here appear in the literature as independently\nderived for individual universality classes or for the branching process.\nHowever, the emergence of non-universal continuously-varying exponent values\n--which, as shown here, stems fro the presence of small external driving, that\nmight induce avalanche merging-- has not been noticed (or emphasized) in the\npast. We believe that a simple an unified perspective as the one presented here\ncan (i) help to clarify the overall picture, (ii) underline the\nsuper-universality of the behavior as well as the dependence on external\ndriving, and (iii) help avoiding the common existing confusion between\nun-biased branching processes (equivalent to a random walker in a balanced\nlogarithmic potential) and standard (un-confined) random walkers.\n", "  We present the derivation of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics\nfrom an effective Boltzmann equation for a system consisting of quasiparticles\nof a single species. We consider temperature-dependent masses of the\nquasiparticles and devise a thermodynamically-consistent framework to formulate\nsecond-order evolution equations for shear and bulk viscous pressure\ncorrections. The main advantage of this formulation is that one can\nconsistently implement realistic equation of state of the medium within the\nframework of kinetic theory. Specializing to the case of one-dimensional\npurely-longitudinal boost-invariant expansion, we study the effect of this new\nformulation on viscous hydrodynamic evolution of strongly-interacting matter\nformed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We study the effect of applied strain as a physical control parameter for the\nphase transitions of Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 using resistivity, magnetization, x-ray\ndiffraction and 57Fe M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Biaxial strain, namely\ncompression of the basal plane of the tetragonal unit cell, is created through\nfirm bonding of samples to a rigid substrate, via differential thermal\nexpansion. This strain is shown to induce a magneto-structural phase transition\nin originally paramagnetic samples; and superconductivity in previously\nnon-superconducting ones. The magneto-structural transition is gradual as a\nconsequence of using strain instead of pressure or stress as a tuning\nparameter.\n", "  In this work, we use a test based on the differential ages of galaxies for\ndistinguishing the dark energy models. As proposed by Jimenez and Loeb,\nrelative ages of galaxies can be used to put constraints on various\ncosmological parameters. In the same vein, we reconstruct $H_0dt/dz$ and its\nderivative ($H_0d^2t/dz^2$) using a model independent technique called\nnon-parametric smoothing. Basically, $dt/dz$ is the change in the age of the\nobject as a function of redshift which is directly link with the Hubble\nparameter. Hence for reconstruction of this quantity, we use the most recent\n$H(z)$ data. Further, we calculate $H_0dt/dz$ and its derivative for several\nmodels like Phantom, Einstein de Sitter (EdS), $\\Lambda$CDM,\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan\n(JBP) parametrization and Feng-Shen-Li-Li (FSLL) parametrization. We check the\nconsistency of these models with the results of reconstruction obtained in\nmodel independent way from the data. It is observed that $H_0dt/dz$ as a tool\nis not able to distinguish between the $\\Lambda$CDM, CPL, JBP and FSLL\nparametrizations but as expected EdS and Phantom models show noticeable\ndeviation from the reconstructed results. Further, the derivative of $H_0dt/dz$\nfor various dark energy models is more sensitive at low redshift. It is\nobserved that the FSLL model is not consistent with the reconstructed results\nat redshifts less than $0.5$, however, the $\\Lambda$CDM model is in concordance\nwith the 3$\\sigma$ region of the reconstruction.\n", "  We consider finite-sized interfaces of a Weyl semi-metal and show that the\ncorresponding confinement potential is similar to the application of a magnetic\nfield. Among the numerous states, which can be labeled by indices n like in\nLandau levels, the n = 0 surface state describes the Weyl semimetal Fermi arc\nat a given chemical potential. Moreover, the analogy with a magnetic field\nshows that an external in-plane magnetic field can be used to distort the Fermi\narc and would explain some features of magneto-transport in Weyl semimetals. We\nderive the Fermi arc for type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals where we deal with\nthe tilt anisotropy by the use of Lorentz boosts. In the case of type-II Weyl\nsemimetals, this leads to many additional topologically trivial surface states\nat low energy. Finally, we extend the Aharonov-Casher argument and demonstrate\nthe stability of the Fermi arc over fluctuations of the surface potential.\n", "  We study the absorption and scattering of X-ray radiation by interstellar\ndust particles, which allows us to access the physical and chemical properties\nof dust. The interstellar dust composition is not well understood, especially\non the densest sight lines of the Galactic Plane. X-rays provide a powerful\ntool in this study. We present newly acquired laboratory measurements of\nsilicate compounds taken at the Soleil synchrotron facility in Paris using the\nLucia beamline. The dust absorption profiles resulting from this campaign were\nused in this pilot study to model the absorption by interstellar dust along the\nline of sight of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 5-1. The measured\nlaboratory cross-sections were adapted for astrophysical data analysis and the\nresulting extinction profiles of the Si K-edge were implemented in the SPEX\nspectral fitting program. We derive the properties of the interstellar dust\nalong the line of sight by fitting the Si K-edge seen in absorption in the\nspectrum of GX 5-1. We measured the hydrogen column density towards GX 5-1 to\nbe $3.40\\pm0.1\\times10^{22} \\rm cm^{-2}$. The best fit of the silicon edge in\nthe spectrum of GX 5-1 is obtained by a mixture of olivine and pyroxene. In\nthis study, our modeling is limited to Si absorption by silicates with\ndifferent Mg:Fe ratios. We obtained an abundance of silicon in dust of\n$4.0\\pm0.3\\times10^{-5}$ per H atom and a lower limit for total abundance,\nconsidering both gas and dust, of $>4.4\\times10^{-5}$ per H atom, which leads\nto a gas to dust ratio of >0.22. Furthermore, an enhanced scattering feature in\nthe Si K-edge may suggest the presence of large particles along the line of\nsight.\n", "  We study three-body recombination in an ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. We\nfirst show theoretically that, for weak inter-species coupling, the loss rate\nis proportional to Tan's contact. Second, using a 7 Li/ 6 Li mixture we probe\nthe recombination rate in both the thermal and dual superfluid regimes. We find\nexcellent agreement with our model in the BEC-BCS crossover. At unitarity where\nthe fermion-fermion scattering length diverges, we show that the loss rate is\nproportional the 4/3 power of the fermionic density. Our results demonstrate\nthat impurity-induced losses can be used as a quantitative probe of many-body\ncorrelations.\n", "  We discuss the duality in three dimensional quantum field theory at infrared\nlimit. The starting point is to use a conjecture of a duality between the free\nfermion and the interacting scalar field theories at the Wilson-Fisher fixed\npoint. The conjecture is useful for deriving various dualities in three\ndimensions to obtain a duality web. The study is also interesting for\nunderstanding the dualities, or equivalence of different theories from the\nperspective of the renormalization group flow. We first discuss the\n\"derivation\" without losing the holonomy. Furthermore, we also derive these\ndualities from the mean-field study, and consider the extension of the\nconjecture or dualities at finite temperature.\n", "  We theoretically analyze contributions from the Kondo effect to the spin\npolarization and spin diffusion length in all-metal nonlocal spin valves.\nInterdiffusion of ferromagnetic atoms into the normal metal layer creates a\nregion in which Kondo physics plays a significant role, giving discrepancies\nbetween experiment and existing theory. We start from a simple model and\nconstruct a modified spin drift-diffusion equation which clearly demonstrates\nhow the Kondo physics not only suppresses the electrical conductivity but even\nmore strongly reduces the spin diffusion length. We also present an explicit\nexpression for the suppression of spin polarization due to Kondo physics in an\nillustrative regime. We compare this theory to previous experimental data to\nextract an estimate of the Elliot-Yafet probability for Kondo spin flip\nscattering of 0.7 $\\pm$ 0.4, in good agreement with the value of 2/3 derived in\nthe original theory of Kondo.\n", "  Aims: In this paper we focus on the occurrence of glycolaldehyde (HCOCH2OH)\nin young solar analogs by performing the first homogeneous and unbiased study\nof this molecule in the Class 0 protostars of the nearby Perseus star forming\nregion. Methods: We obtained sub-arcsec angular resolution maps at 1.3mm and\n1.4mm of glycolaldehyde emission lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure (PdB)\ninterferometer in the framework of the CALYPSO IRAM large program. Results:\nGlycolaldehyde has been detected towards 3 Class 0 and 1 Class I protostars out\nof the 13 continuum sources targeted in Perseus: NGC1333-IRAS2A1,\nNGC1333-IRAS4A2, NGC1333-IRAS4B1, and SVS13-A. The NGC1333 star forming region\nlooks particularly glycolaldehyde rich, with a rate of occurrence up to 60%.\nThe glycolaldehyde spatial distribution overlaps with the continuum one,\ntracing the inner 100 au around the protostar. A large number of lines (up to\n18), with upper-level energies Eu from 37 K up to 375 K has been detected. We\nderived column densities > 10^15 cm^-2 and rotational temperatures Trot between\n115 K and 236 K, imaging for the first time hot-corinos around NGC1333-IRAS4B1\nand SVS13-A. Conclusions: In multiple systems glycolaldehyde emission is\ndetected only in one component. The case of the SVS13-A+B and IRAS4-A1+A2\nsystems support that the detection of glycolaldehyde (at least in the present\nPerseus sample) indicates older protostars (i.e. SVS13-A and IRAS4-A2), evolved\nenough to develop the hot-corino region (i.e. 100 K in the inner 100 au).\nHowever, only two systems do not allow us to firmly conclude whether the\nprimary factor leading to the detection of glycolaldehyde emission is the\nenvironments hosting the protostars, evolution (e.g. low value of Lsubmm/Lint),\nor accretion luminosity (high Lint).\n", "  We examine the possibility that Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) originate from the\nactivity of extragalactic civilizations. Our analysis shows that beams used for\npowering large light sails could yield parameters that are consistent with\nFRBs. The characteristic diameter of the beam emitter is estimated through a\ncombination of energetic and engineering constraints, and both approaches\nintriguingly yield a similar result which is on the scale of a large rocky\nplanet. Moreover, the optimal frequency for powering the light sail is shown to\nbe similar to the detected FRB frequencies. These `coincidences' lend some\ncredence to the possibility that FRBs might be artificial in origin. Other\nrelevant quantities, such as the characteristic mass of the light sail, and the\nangular velocity of the beam, are also derived. By using the FRB occurrence\nrate, we infer upper bounds on the rate of FRBs from extragalactic\ncivilizations in a typical galaxy. The possibility of detecting fainter signals\nis briefly discussed, and the wait time for an exceptionally bright FRB event\nin the Milky Way is estimated.\n", "  One version of the energy-time uncertainty principle states that the minimum\ntime $T_{\\perp}$ for a quantum system to evolve from a given state to any\northogonal state is $h/(4 \\Delta E)$ where $\\Delta E$ is the energy\nuncertainty. A related bound called the Margolus-Levitin theorem states that\n$T_{\\perp} \\geq h/(2 E)$ where E is the expectation value of energy and the\nground energy is taken to be zero. Many subsequent works have interpreted\n$T_{\\perp}$ as defining a minimal time for an elementary computational\noperation and correspondingly a fundamental limit on clock speed determined by\na system's energy. Here we present local time-independent Hamiltonians in which\ncomputational clock speed becomes arbitrarily large relative to E and $\\Delta\nE$ as the number of computational steps goes to infinity. We argue that energy\nconsiderations alone are not sufficient to obtain an upper bound on\ncomputational speed, and that additional physical assumptions such as limits to\ninformation density and information transmission speed are necessary to obtain\nsuch a bound.\n", "  3D non-LTE radiative transfer problems are computationally demanding, and\nthis sets limits on the size of the problems that can be solved. So far\nMultilevel Accelerated Lambda Iteration (MALI) has been to the method of choice\nto perform high-resolution computations in multidimensional problems. The\ndisadvantage of MALI is that its computing time scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$,\nwith $n$ the number of grid points. When the grid gets finer, the computational\ncost increases quadratically. We aim to develop a 3D non-LTE radiative transfer\ncode that is more efficient than MALI. We implement a non-linear multigrid,\nfast approximation storage scheme, into the existing Multi3D radiative transfer\ncode. We verify our multigrid implementation by comparing with MALI\ncomputations. We show that multigrid can be employed in realistic problems with\nsnapshots from 3D radiative-MHD simulations as input atmospheres. With\nmultigrid, we obtain a factor 3.3-4.5 speedup compared to MALI. With\nfull-multigrid the speed-up increases to a factor 6. The speedup is expected to\nincrease for input atmospheres with more grid points and finer grid spacing.\nSolving 3D non-LTE radiative transfer problems using non-linear multigrid\nmethods can be applied to realistic atmospheres with a substantial speed-up.\n", "  We study the galactic wind in the edge-on spiral galaxy UGC 10043 with the\ncombination of the CALIFA integral field spectroscopy data, scanning\nFabry-Perot interferometry (FPI), and multiband photometry. We detect ionized\ngas in the extraplanar regions reaching a relatively high distance, up to ~ 4\nkpc above the galactic disk. The ionized gas line ratios ([N ii]/Ha, [S ii]/Ha\nand [O i]/Ha) present an enhancement along the semi minor axis, in contrast\nwith the values found at the disk, where they are compatible with ionization\ndue to H ii-regions. These differences, together with the biconic symmetry of\nthe extra-planar ionized structure, makes UGC 10043 a clear candidate for a\ngalaxy with gas outflows ionizated by shocks. From the comparison of shock\nmodels with the observed line ratios, and the kinematics observed from the FPI\ndata, we constrain the physical properties of the observed outflow. The data\nare compatible with a velocity increase of the gas along the extraplanar\ndistances up to < 400 km/s and the preshock density decreasing in the same\ndirection. We also observe a discrepancy in the SFR estimated based on Ha (0.36\nMsun/yr ) and the estimated with the CIGALE code, being the latter 5 times\nlarger. Nevertheless, this SFR is still not enough to drive the observed\ngalactic wind if we do not take into account the filling factor. We stress that\nthe combination of the three techniques of observation with models is a\npowerful tool to explore galactic winds in the Local Universe.\n", "  Radial transport of particles, elements and fluid driven by internal stresses\nin three-dimensional (3D) astrophysical accretion disks is an important\nphenomenon, potentially relevant for the outward dust transport in\nprotoplanetary disks, origin of the refractory particles in comets, isotopic\nequilibration in the Earth-Moon system, etc. To gain better insight into these\nprocesses, we explore the dependence of meridional circulation in 3D disks with\nshear viscosity on their thermal stratification, and demonstrate strong effect\nof the latter on the radial flow. Previous locally isothermal studies have\nnormally found a pattern of the radial outflow near the midplane, switching to\ninflow higher up. Here we show, both analytically and numerically, that a flow,\nwhich is inward at all altitudes, is possible in disks with entropy and\ntemperature steeply increasing with height. Such thermodynamic conditions may\nbe typical in the optically thin, viscously heated accretion disks. Disks in\nwhich these conditions do not hold should feature radial outflow near the\nmidplane, as long as their internal stress is provided by the shear viscosity.\nOur results can also be used for designing hydrodynamical disk simulations with\na prescribed pattern of the meridional circulation.\n", "  We investigate the existence of a metallicity threshold for the production of\nlong gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). We used the host galaxies of the Swift/BAT6\nsample of LGRBs. We considered the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and\nmetallicity determined from the host galaxy photometry and spectroscopy up to z\n= 2 and used them to compare the distribution of host galaxies to that of field\ngalaxies in the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relation plane. We\nfind that although LGRBs also form in galaxies with relatively large stellar\nmasses, the large majority of host galaxies have metallicities below\nlog(O=H)~8.6. The extension to z = 2 results in a good sampling of stellar\nmasses also above Log(Mstar/Msun)~9.5 and provides evidence that LGRB host\ngalaxies do not follow the fundamental metallicity relation. As shown by the\ncomparison with dedicated numerical simulations of LGRB host galaxy population,\nthese results are naturally explained by the existence of a mild (~0.7 Zsun)\nthreshold for the LGRB formation. The present statistics does not allow us to\ndiscriminate between different shapes of the metallicity cutoff, but the\nrelatively high metallicity threshold found in this work is somewhat in\ndisagreement to most of the standard single-star models for LGRB progenitors.\n", "  Turbulent state of spectrally stable shear flows may be developed and\nsustained according to the bypass scenario of transition. If it works in\nnon-magnetised boundless and homogeneous quasi-Keplerian flow, transiently\ngrowing shearing vortices should supply turbulence with energy. Employing the\nlarge shearing box approximation, as well as a set of global disc models, we\nstudy the optimal growth of the shearing vortices in such a flow in the whole\nrange of azimuthal length-scales, $\\lambda_y$, as compared to the flow\nscale-height, $H$. It is shown that with the account of the viscosity the\nhighest possible amplification of shearing vortices, $G_{max}$, attains maximum\nat $\\lambda_y\\lesssim H$ and declines towards both the large scales\n$\\lambda_y\\gg H$ and the small scales $\\lambda_y\\ll H$ in a good agreement with\nanalytical estimations based on balanced solutions. We pay main attention to\nthe large-scale vortices $\\lambda_y\\gg H$, which produce $G_{max}\\propto\n(\\Omega/\\kappa)^4$, where $\\Omega$ and $\\kappa$ denote local rotational and\nepicyclic frequencies, respectively. It is demonstrated that the large-scale\nvortices acquire high density perturbation as they approach the instant of\nswing. At the same time, their growth is not affected by bulk viscosity. We\ncheck that $G_{max}$ obtained globally is comparable to its local counterpart\nand the shape and localisation of global optimal vortices can be explained in\nterms of the local approach. The obtained results allow us to suggest that the\ncritical Reynolds number of subcritical transition to turbulence in\nquasi-Keplerian flow, as well as the corresponding turbulent effective\nazimuthal stress should substantially depend on shear rate.\n", "  Context. The Odin satellite is now into its sixteenth year of operation, much\nsurpassing its design life of two years. One of the sources which Odin has\nobserved in great detail is the Sgr A Complex in the centre of the Milky Way.\nAims. To study the presence of NH3 in the Galactic Centre and spiral arms.\nMethods. Recently, Odin has made complementary observations of the 572 GHz NH3\nline towards the Sgr A +50 km/s Cloud and Circumnuclear Disk (CND). Results.\nSignificant NH3 emission has been observed in both the +50 km/s Cloud and the\nCND. Clear NH3 absorption has also been detected in many of the spiral arm\nfeatures along the line of sight from the Sun to the core of our Galaxy.\nConclusions. The very large velocity width (80 km/s) of the NH3 emission\nassociated with the shock region in the southwestern part of the CND may\nsuggest a formation/desorption scenario similar to that of gas-phase H2O in\nshocks/outflows.\n", "  Nuclear burning near the surface of an accreting neutron star produces ashes\nthat, when compressed deeper by further accretion, alter the star's thermal and\ncompositional structure. Bygone nucleosynthesis can be constrained by the\nimpact of compressed ashes on the thermal relaxation of quiescent neutron star\ntransients. In particular, Urca cooling nuclei pairs in nuclear burning ashes,\nwhich cool the neutron star crust via neutrino emission from\nelectron-capture/beta-decay cycles, provide signatures of prior nuclear burning\nover the ~century timescales it takes to accrete to the electron-capture depth\nof the strongest cooling pairs. Using crust cooling models of the accreting\nneutron star transient MAXI J0556-332, we show that this source likely lacked\nType I X-ray bursts and superbursts >120 years ago. Reduced nuclear physics\nuncertainties in rp-process reaction rates and electron-capture ft-values for\nlow-lying transitions will improve nucleosynthesis constraints using this\ntechnique.\n", "  The photon mass, $m_\\gamma$, can in principle be constrained using\nmeasurements of the dispersion measures (DMs) of fast radio bursts (FRBs), once\nthe FRB redshifts are known. The DM of the repeating FRB 121102 is known to $<\n1$\\%, a host galaxy has now been identified with high confidence,and its\nredshift, $z$, has now been determined with high accuracy: $z = 0.19273(8)$.\nTaking into account the plasma contributions to the DM from the Intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) and the Milky Way, we use the data on FRB 121102 to derive the\nconstraint $m_\\gamma \\lesssim 2.2 \\times 10^{-14}$ eV c$^{-2}$ ($3.9 \\times\n10^{-50}$ kg). Since the plasma and photon mass contributions to DMs have\ndifferent redshift dependences, they could in principle be distinguished by\nmeasurements of more FRB redshifts, enabling the sensitivity to $m_\\gamma$ to\nbe improved.\n", "  We present a semi-analytical correction to the seminal solution for the\nsecular motion of a planet's orbit under gravitational influence of an external\nperturber derived by Heppenheimer (1978). A comparison between analytical\npredictions and numerical simulations allows us to determine corrective factors\nfor the secular frequency and forced eccentricity in the co-planar restricted\nthree-body problem. The correction is given in the form of a polynomial\nfunction of the system's parameters that can be applied to first-order forced\neccentricity and secular frequency estimates. The resulting secular equations\nare simple, straight forward to use and improve the fidelity of Heppenheimer's\nsolution well beyond higher-order models. The quality and convergence of the\ncorrected secular equations are tested for a wide range of parameters and\nlimits of its applicability are given.\n", "  Phase transitions in isotropic quantum antiferromagnets are associated with\nthe condensation of bosonic triplet excitations. In three dimensional quantum\nantiferromagnets, such as TlCuCl$_3$, condensation can be either pressure or\nmagnetic field induced. The corresponding magnetic order obeys universal\nscaling with thermal critical exponent $\\phi$. Employing a relativistic quantum\nfield theory, the present work predicts the emergence of multiple (three)\nuniversalities under combined pressure and field tuning. Changes of\nuniversality are signalled by changes of the critical exponent $\\phi$.\nExplicitly, we predict the existence of two new exponents $\\phi=1$ and $1/2$ as\nwell as recovering the known exponent $\\phi=3/2$. We also predict logarithmic\ncorrections to the power law scaling.\n", "  We consider two (natural) families of observables $O_k$ for systems with\ndimension $d=3,4,5$: the spin observables $S_x$, $S_y$ and $S_z$, and the\nobservables that have mutually unbiased bases as eigenstates. We derive tight\nentropic uncertainty relations for these families, in the form\n$\\sum_kH(O_k)\\geqslant\\alpha_d$, where $H(O_k)$ is the Shannon entropy of the\nmeasurement outcomes of $O_k$ and $\\alpha_d$ is a constant. We show that most\nof our bounds are stronger than previously known ones. We also give the form of\nthe states that attain these inequalities.\n", "  We calculated the QCD equation of state using Taylor expansions that include\ncontributions from up to sixth order in the baryon, strangeness and electric\ncharge chemical potentials. Calculations have been performed with the Highly\nImproved Staggered Quark action in the temperature range $T\\in [135~{\\rm MeV},\n330~{\\rm MeV}]$ using up to four different sets of lattice cut-offs\ncorresponding to lattices of size $N_\\sigma^3\\times N_\\tau$ with aspect ratio\n$N_\\sigma/N_\\tau=4$ and $N_\\tau =6-16$. The strange quark mass is tuned to its\nphysical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$\nand $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$\nMeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV. We provide a parametrization of basic thermodynamic quantities that\ncan be readily used in hydrodynamic simulation codes. The results on up to\nsixth order expansion coefficients of bulk thermodynamics are used for the\ncalculation of lines of constant pressure, energy and entropy densities in the\n$T$-$\\mu_B$ plane and are compared with the crossover line for the QCD chiral\ntransition as well as with experimental results on freeze-out parameters in\nheavy ion collisions. These coefficients also provide estimates for the\nlocation of a possible critical point. We argue that results on sixth order\nexpansion coefficients disfavor the existence of a critical point in the QCD\nphase diagram for $\\mu_B/T\\le 2$ and $T/T_c(\\mu_B=0) > 0.9$.\n", "  Light-by-light scattering sumrules based on general field theory principles\nrelate cross-sections with different helicities. In this paper the simplest\nsumrule is tested for the $I=0$ and $2$ channels for \"real\" photon-photon\ncollisions. Important contributions come from the long-lived pseudoscalar\nmesons and from di-meson intermediate states. The latest Amplitude Analysis of\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\pi\\pi, \\overline{K}K$ allows this contribution to be\nevaluated. However, we find that other multi-meson contributions up to 2.5 GeV\nare required to satisfy the sumrules. While data on three and four pion\ncross-sections exist, there is no information about their isospin and helicity\ndecomposition. Nevertheless, we show the measured cross-sections are\nsufficiently large to ensure the sumrules for the helicity differences are\nlikely fulfilled.\n", "  We study the Casimir interaction between perfectly conducting sphere and\nplate in the classical limit of high temperatures. By taking the small-distance\nexpansion of the exact scattering formula, we compute the leading correction to\nthe Casimir energy beyond the commonly employed proximity force approximation.\nWe find that for a sphere of radius $R$ at distance $d$ from the plate the\ncorrection is of the form $\\ln^2 (d/R)$, in agreement with indications from\nrecent large-scale numerical computations. We develop a fast-converging\nnumerical scheme for computing the Casimir interaction to high precision, based\non bispherical partial waves, and we verify that the short-distance formula\nprovides precise values of the Casimir energy also for fairly large distances.\n", "  We study the rotation-activity correlations (RACs) in a sample stars from\nspectral type dK4 to dM4. We study RACs using chromospheric data and coronal\ndata. We study the Ca\\,{\\sc ii} line surface fluxes-$P/\\sin i$ RACs. We fit the\nRACs with linear homoscedastic and heteroscedastic regression models. We find\nthat these RACs differ substantially from one spectral sub-type to another. For\ndM3 and dM4 stars, we find that the RACs cannot be described by a simple model,\nbut instead that there may exist two distinct RAC behaviors for the low\nactivity and the high activity stellar sub-samples respectively. Although these\nresults are preliminary and will need confirmation, the data suggest that these\ndistinct RACs may be associated with different dynamo regimes.\n  We also study R'$_{HK}$ as a function of the Rossby number R$_{0}$. We find\nthat: (i) For dK4 stars, we confirm R'$_{HK}$ as a function of R$_{0}$ agrees\nwell with previous results for F-G-K stars. (ii) In dK6, dM2, dM3 and dM4\nstars, we find that, at a given R$_{0}$, the values of R'$_{HK}$ lie a factor\nof 3, 10, 20 and 90 respectively below the F-G-K RAC. Our results suggest a\nsignificant decrease in the efficiency of the dynamo mechanism(s) as regards\nchromospheric heating before and at dM3, i.e. before and at the TTCC.\n  We also show that the ratio of coronal heating to chromospheric heating\n$L_{X}/L_{HK}$ increases by a factor of 100 between dK4 and dM4 stars.\n", "  For the past three years we have been conducting a survey for WR stars in the\nLarge and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC). Our previous work has resulted in\nthe discovery of a new type of WR star in the LMC, which we are calling WN3/O3.\nThese stars have the emission-line properties of a WN3 star (strong N V but no\nN IV), plus the absorption-line properties of an O3 star (Balmer hydrogen plus\nPickering He II but no He I). Yet these stars are 15x fainter than an O3 V star\nwould be by itself, ruling out these being WN3+O3 binaries. Here we report the\ndiscovery of two more members of this class, bringing the total number of these\nobjects to 10, 6.5% of the LMC's total WR population. The optical spectra of\nnine of these WN3/O3s are virtually indistinguishable from each other, but one\nof the newly found stars is significantly different, showing a lower excitation\nemission and absorption spectrum (WN4/O4-ish). In addition, we have newly\nclassified three unusual Of-type stars, including one with a strong C III 4650\nline, and two rapidly rotating \"Oef\" stars. We also \"rediscovered\" a low mass\nx-ray binary, RX J0513.9-6951, and demonstrate its spectral variability.\nFinally, we discuss the spectra of ten low priority WR candidates that turned\nout not to have He II emission. These include both a Be star and a B[e] star.\n", "  We present high-speed, multicolour photometry of the faint, eclipsing\ncataclysmic variable (CV) SDSS J105754.25+275947.5. The light from this system\nis dominated by the white dwarf. Nonetheless, averaging many eclipses reveals\nadditional features from the eclipse of the bright spot. This enables the\nfitting of a parameterised eclipse model to these average light curves,\nallowing the precise measurement of system parameters. We find a mass ratio of\nq = 0.0546 $\\pm$ 0.0020 and inclination i = 85.74 $\\pm$ 0.21$^{\\circ}$. The\nwhite dwarf and donor masses were found to be M$_{\\mathrm{w}}$ = 0.800 $\\pm$\n0.015 M$_{\\odot}$ and M$_{\\mathrm{d}}$ = 0.0436 $\\pm$ 0.0020 M$_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. A temperature T$_{\\mathrm{w}}$ = 13300 $\\pm$ 1100 K and distance\nd = 367 $\\pm$ 26 pc of the white dwarf were estimated through fitting model\natmosphere predictions to multicolour fluxes. The mass of the white dwarf in\nSDSS 105754.25+275947.5 is close to the average for CV white dwarfs, while the\ndonor has the lowest mass yet measured in an eclipsing CV. A low-mass donor and\nan orbital period (90.44 min) significantly longer than the period minimum\nstrongly suggest that this is a bona fide period-bounce system, although\nformation from a white dwarf/brown dwarf binary cannot be ruled out. Very few\nperiod-minimum/period-bounce systems with precise system parameters are\ncurrently known, and as a consequence the evolution of CVs in this regime is\nnot yet fully understood.\n", "  The advancement of our understanding of MHD turbulence opens ways to develop\nnew techniques to probe magnetic fields. In MHD turbulence, the velocity\ngradients are expected to be perpendicular to magnetic fields and this fact was\nused by Gonsalvez-Casanova & Lazarian to introduce a new technique to trace\nmagnetic fields using velocity centroid gradients. The latter can be obtained\nfrom spectroscopic observations. We apply the technique to GALFA HI survey data\nand compare the directions of magnetic fields obtained with our technique with\nthe direction of magnetic fields obtained using PLANCK polarization. We find\nexcellent correspondence between the two ways of magnetic field tracing, which\nis obvious via visual comparison and through measuring of the statistics of\nmagnetic field fluctuations obtained with the polarization data and our\ntechnique. This suggests that the velocity centroid gradients can provide a\nreliable way of measuring of the foreground magnetic field fluctuations and\nthus provide a new way of separating foreground and CMB polarization signals.\n", "  We study the processes $e^+ e^-\\to K^0_S K^0_L\\pi^0\\gamma$, $K^0_S\nK^0_L\\eta\\gamma$, and $K^0_S K^0_L\\pi^0\\pi^0\\gamma$, where the photon is\nradiated from the initial state, providing cross section measurements for the\nhadronic final states over a continuum of center-of-mass energies. The results\nare based on 469~$fb^{-1}$ of data collected at or near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$~\nresonance with the BaBar detector at SLAC. We present the first measurements of\nthe $e^+ e^-\\to K^0_S K^0_L\\pi^0$, $K^0_S K^0_L\\eta$, and $K^0_S\nK^0_L\\pi^0\\pi^0$ cross sections up to a center-of-mass energy of 4~GeV, and\nstudy their intermediate resonance structures. We observe $J/\\psi$ decays to\nall of these final states for the first time, present measurements of their\n$J/\\psi$ branching fractions, and search for $\\psi(2S)$ decays.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are extremely powerful cosmic objects, driven by\naccretion of hot gas upon super-massive black holes. The zoo of AGN classes are\ndivided into two major groups, with Type-1 AGN displaying broad Balmer emission\nlines and Type-2 narrow ones. For a long time it was believed that a Type-2 AGN\nis a Type-1 AGN viewed through a dusty kiloparsec-size torus, but an emerging\nbody of observations suggests more than just the viewing angle matters. Here we\nreport significant differences in supernova counts and classes in the first\nstudy to date of supernovae near Type-1 and Type-2 AGN host galaxies, using\ndata from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 7 and Galaxy Zoo. We detect many more supernovae in Type-2\nAGN hosts (size of effect $\\sim$ 5.1$\\sigma$) compared to Type-1 hosts, which\nshows that the two classes of AGN are located inside host galaxies with\ndifferent properties. In addition, Type-1 and Type-2 AGN that are dominated by\nstar formation according to WISE colours $m_{W1} - m_{W2} < 0.5$ and are\nmatched in 22 $\\mu$m absolute magnitude differ by a factor of ten in\n$L$[OIII]$\\lambda$5007 luminosity, suggesting that when residing in similar\ntype of host galaxies Type-1 AGN are much more luminous. Our results\ndemonstrate two more factors that play an important role in completing the\ncurrent picture: the age of stellar populations and the AGN luminosity. This\nhas immediate consequences for understanding the many AGN classes and galaxy\nevolution.\n", "  A series of Yb2Ti2O7 doped samples demonstrates the effects of\noff-stoichiometry on Yb2Ti2O7's structure, properties, and magnetic ground\nstate via x-ray diffraction, specific heat, and magnetization measurements. A\nstoichiometric single crystal of Yb2Ti2O7 grown by the traveling solvent\nfloating zone technique (solvent = 30 wt% rutile TiO2 and 70 wt% Yb2Ti2O7) is\ncharacterized and evaluated in light of this series. Our data shows that upon\npositive x doping, the cubic lattice parameter a increases and the Curie-Weiss\ntemperature decreases. Heat capacity measurements of stoichiometric Yb2Ti2O7\nsamples exhibit a sharp, first-order peak at T = 268(4) mK that is suppressed\nin magnitude and temperature in samples doped off ideal stoichiometry. The full\nentropy recovered per Yb ion is 5.7 J/K ~ Rln2. Our work establishes the\neffects of doping on Yb2Ti2O7's physical properties, which provides further\nevidence indicating that previous crystals grown by the traditional floating\nzone method are doped off ideal stoichiometry. Additionally, we present how to\ngrow high-quality colorless single crystals of Yb2Ti2O7 by the traveling\nsolvent floating zone growth method.\n", "  The competition between spin-orbit coupling, bandwidth ($W$) and\nelectron-electron interaction ($U$) makes iridates highly susceptible to small\nexternal perturbations, which can trigger the onset of novel types of\nelectronic and magnetic states. Here we employ {\\em first principles}\ncalculations based on density functional theory and on the constrained random\nphase approximation to study how dimensionality and strain affect the strength\nof $U$ and $W$ in (SrIrO$_3$)$_m$/(SrTiO$_3$) superlattices. The result is a\nphase diagram explaining two different types of controllable magnetic and\nelectronic transitions, spin-flop and insulator-to-metal, connected with the\ndisruption of the $J_{eff}=1/2$ state which cannnot be understood within a\nsimplified local picture.\n", "  We present results from a Keck/HIRES radial velocity campaign to study four\nsub-Saturn-sized planets, K2-27b, K2-32b, K2-39b, and K2-108b, with the goal of\nunderstanding their masses, orbits, and heavy element enrichment. The planets\nhave similar sizes $(R_P = 4.5-5.5~R_E)$, but have dissimilar masses $(M_P =\n16-60~M_E)$, implying a diversity in their core and envelope masses. K2-32b is\nthe least massive $(M_P = 16.5 \\pm 2.7~M_E)$ and orbits in close proximity to\ntwo sub-Neptunes near a 3:2:1 period commensurability. K2-27b and K2-39b are\nsignificantly more massive at $M_P = 30.9 \\pm 4.6~M_E$ and $M_P = 39.8 \\pm\n4.4~M_E$, respectively, and show no signs of additional planets. K2-108b is the\nmost massive at $M_P = 59.4 \\pm 4.4~M_E$, implying a large reservoir of heavy\nelements of about $\\approx50~M_E$. Sub-Saturns as a population have a large\ndiversity in planet mass at a given size. They exhibit remarkably little\ncorrelation between mass and size; sub-Saturns range from $\\approx 6-60~M_E$,\nregardless of size. We find a strong correlation between planet mass and host\nstar metallicity, suggesting that metal-rich disks form more massive planet\ncores. The most massive sub-Saturns tend to lack detected companions and have\nmoderately eccentric orbits, perhaps as a result of a previous epoch of\ndynamical instability. Finally, we observe only a weak correlation between the\nplanet envelope fraction and present-day equilibrium temperature, suggesting\nthat photo-evaporation does not play a dominant role in determining the amount\nof gas sub-Saturns accrete from their protoplanetary disks.\n", "  Eruptive flares are sudden releases of magnetic energy that involve many\nphenomena, several of which can be explained by the standard 2D flare model and\nits realizations in three-dimensions. We analyze a three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulation in the framework of this model that naturally\nexplains the contraction of coronal loops in the proximity of the flare sites,\nas well as the inflow towards the region above the cusp-shaped loops.\n  We find that two vorticity arcs located along the flanks of the erupting\nmagnetic flux rope are generated as soon as the eruption begins. The magnetic\narcades above the flux-rope legs are then subjected to expansion, rotation or\ncontraction depending on which part of the vortex-flow advects them. In\naddition to the vortices, an inward-directed magnetic pressure gradient exists\nin the current sheet below the magnetic flux rope. It results in the formation\nof a sink that is maintained by reconnection.\n  We conclude that coronal loop apparent implosions observed during eruptive\nflares are the result of hydro-magnetic effects related to the generation of\nvortex- and sink-flows when a flux rope moves in a magnetized environment.\n", "  Measurements of high-velocity clouds' metallicities provide important clues\nabout their origins, and hence on whether they play a role in fueling ongoing\nstar formation in the Galaxy. However, accurate interpretation of these\nmeasurements requires compensating for the galactic material that has been\nmixed into the clouds. In order to determine how much the metallicity changes\nas a result of this mixing, we have carried out three-dimensional\nwind-tunnel-like hydrodynamical simulations of an example cloud. Our model\ncloud is patterned after the Smith Cloud, a particularly well-studied cloud of\nmass $\\sim 5 \\times 10^6~M_\\odot$. We calculated the fraction of the\nhigh-velocity material that had originated in the galactic halo,\n$F_\\mathrm{h}$, for various sight lines passing through our model cloud. We\nfind that $F_\\mathrm{h}$ generally increases with distance from the head of the\ncloud, reaching $\\sim$0.5 in the tail of the cloud. Models in which the\nmetallicities (relative to solar) of the original cloud, $Z_\\mathrm{cl}$, and\nof the halo, $Z_\\mathrm{h}$, are in the approximate ranges $0.1 \\lesssim\nZ_\\mathrm{cl} \\lesssim 0.3$ and $0.7 \\lesssim Z_\\mathrm{h} \\lesssim 1.0$,\nrespectively, are in rough agreement with the observations. Models with\n$Z_\\mathrm{h} \\sim 0.1$ and $Z_\\mathrm{cl} \\gtrsim 0.5$ are also in rough\nagreement with the observations, but such a low halo metallicity is\ninconsistent with recent independent measurements. We conclude that the Smith\nCloud's observed metallicity may not be a true reflection of its original\nmetallicity and that the cloud's ultimate origin remains uncertain.\n", "  We report the discovery of a 20-kpc-sized H{\\alpha} emission in SDSS\nJ083803.68+540642.0, a ringed dwarf galaxy (M$_V$ = -17.89 mag) hosting an\naccreting intermediate-mass black hole at z=0.02957. Analysis of the HST images\nindicates that it is an early-type galaxy with a featureless low-surface\nbrightness disk ({\\mu}0 = 20.39 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the V band) and a\nprominent, relatively red bulge (V - I = 2.03, Re = 0.28 kpc or 0.\"48) that\naccounts for ~81% of the total light in the I band. A circumgalactic ring of a\ndiameter 16 kpc is also detected, with a disperse shape on its south side. The\noptical emission lines reveal the nucleus to be a broad-line LINER. Our MMT\nlongslit observation indicates that the kinematics of the extended H{\\alpha}\nemission is consistent with a rotational gaseous disk, with a mean blueshifted\nvelocity of 162 km s$^{-1}$ and mean redshifted velocity of 86 km s$^{-1}$ .\nAccording to our photoionization calculations, the large-scale H{\\alpha}\nemission is unlikely to be powered by the central nucleus or by hot evolved\n(post-AGB) stars interspersed in the old stellar populations, but by in situ\nstar formation; this is vindicated by the line-ratio diagnostic of the extended\nemission. We propose that both the ring and large-scale H{\\alpha}-emitting gas\nare created by the tidal accretion in a collision-and then merger-with a\ngas-rich galaxy of a comparable mass.\n", "  Hot, diffuse, relativistic plasmas such as sub-Eddington black hole accretion\nflows are expected to be collisionless, yet are commonly modeled as a fluid\nusing ideal general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). Dissipative\neffects such as heat conduction and viscosity can be important in a\ncollisionless plasma and will potentially alter the dynamics and radiative\nproperties of the flow from that in ideal fluid models; we refer to models that\ninclude these processes as Extended GRMHD. Here we describe a new conservative\ncode, grim, that enables all the above and additional physics to be efficiently\nincorporated. grim combines time evolution and primitive variable inversion\nneeded for conservative schemes into a single step using an algorithm that only\nrequires the residuals of the governing equations as inputs. This algorithm\nenables the code to be physics agnostic as well as flexibility regarding\ntime-stepping schemes. grim runs on CPUs, as well as on GPUs, using the same\ncode. We formulate a performance model, and use it to show that our\nimplementation runs optimally on both architectures. grim correctly captures\nclassical GRMHD test problems as well as a new suite of linear and nonlinear\ntest problems with anisotropic conduction and viscosity in special and general\nrelativity. As tests and example applications, we resolve the shock\nsubstructure due to the presence of dissipation, and report on relativistic\nversions of the magneto-thermal instability and heat flux driven buoyancy\ninstability, which arise due to anisotropic heat conduction, and of the\nfirehose instability, which occurs due to anisotropic pressure (i.e.\nviscosity). Finally, we show an example integration of an accretion flow around\na Kerr black hole, using Extended GRMHD.\n", "  To investigate AGN outflows as a tracer of AGN feedback on star-formation, we\nperform integral-field spectroscopy of 20 type 2 AGNs at z<0.1, which are\nluminous AGNs with the [O III] luminosity >10$^{41.5}$ erg/s, and exhibit\nstrong outflow signatures in the [O III] kinematics. By decomposing the\nemission-line profile, we obtain the maps of the narrow and broad components of\n[O III] and H$\\alpha$ lines, respectively. The broad components in both [O III]\nand H$\\alpha$ represent the non-gravitational kinematics, i.e., gas outflows,\nwhile the narrow components, especially in H$\\alpha$, represent the\ngravitational kinematics, i.e., rotational disk. By using the integrated\nspectra within the flux-weighted size of the narrow-line region, we estimate\nthe energetics of the gas outflows. The ionized gas mass is 1.0-38.5$\\times\n10^5$ $M_{\\odot}$, and the mean mass outflow rate is 4.6$\\pm$4.3\n$M_{\\odot}$/yr, which is a factor of ~260 higher than the mean mass accretion\nrate 0.02$\\pm$0.01 $M_{\\odot}$/yr. The mean energy injection rate of the sample\nis 0.8$\\pm$0.6% of the AGN bolometric luminosity, while the momentum flux is\n(5.4$\\pm$3.6)$\\times$ $L_{bol}$/c on average, except for two most kinematically\nenergetic AGNs with low $L_{bol}$, which are possibly due to the dynamical\ntimescale of the outflows. The estimated outflow energetics are consistent with\nthe theoretical expectations for energy-conserving outflows from AGNs, yet we\nfind no supporting evidence of instantaneous quenching of star formation due to\nthe outflows.\n", "  The formation of massive stars remains poorly understood and little is known\nabout their birth multiplicity properties. Here, we investigate the strikingly\nlow radial-velocity dispersion measured for a sample of 11 massive pre- and\nnear-main-sequence stars (sigma_rv = 5.6 +/- 0.2 km/s) in the young massive\nstar forming region M17 to obtain first constraints on the multiplicity\nproperties of young massive stellar objects. Methods: We compute the RV\ndispersion of synthetic populations of massive stars for various multiplicity\nproperties and we compare the simulated sigma_rv distributions to the observed\nvalue. We specifically investigate two scenarios: a low binary fraction and a\ndearth of short-period binary systems. Results: Simulated populations with low\nbinary fractions (f_bin = 0.12_{-0.09}^{+0.16}) or with truncated period\ndistributions (P_cutoff > 9 months) are able to reproduce the low sigma_rv\nobserved within their 68%-confidence intervals. Parent populations with f_bin >\n0.42 or P_cutoff < 47 d can however be rejected at the 5%-significance level.\nBoth constraints are contrast with the high binary fraction and plethora of\nshort-period systems found in few Myr-old, OB-type populations. To explain the\ndifference, the first scenario requires a variation of the outcome of the\nmassive star formation process. In the the second scenario, compact binaries\nmust form later on, and the cut-off period may be related to physical\nlength-scales representative of the bloated pre-main-sequence stellar radii or\nof their accretion disks. Conclusions: If the obtained constraints are\nrepresentative of the overall properties of massive young stellar objects, our\nresults may provide support to a formation process in which binaries are\ninitially formed at larger separations, then harden or migrate to produce the\ntypical (untruncated) power-law period distribution observed in few Myr-old OB\nbinaries.\n", "  We present radio and mm continuum observations of the Galactic center taken\nwith the VLA and ALMA at 44 and 226 GHz, respectively. We detect radio and mm\nemission from IRS 3, lying ~4.5\" NW of Sgr A*, with a spectrum that is\nconsistent with the photospheric emission from an AGB star at the Galactic\ncenter. Millimeter images reveal that the envelope of IRS 3, the brightest and\nmost extended 3.8$\\mu$m Galactic center stellar source, consists of two\nsemi-circular dust shells facing the direction of Sgr A*. The outer\ncircumstellar shell at the distance of 1.6$\\times10^4$ AU, appears to break up\ninto \"fingers\" of dust directed toward Sgr A*. These features coincide with\nmolecular CS (5-4) emission and a near-IR extinction cloud distributed between\nIRS 3 and Sgr A*. The NE-SW asymmetric shape of the IRS 3 shells seen at 3.8\nmicron and radio are interpreted as structures that are tidally distorted by\nSgr A*. Using the kinematics of CS emission and the proper motion of IRS 3, the\ntidally distorted outflowing material from the envelope after 5000 years\nconstrains the distance of IRS 3 to $\\sim$0.7 pc in front of or $\\sim$0.5 pc\nbehind Sgr A*. This suggests that the mass loss by stars near Sgr A* can supply\na reservoir of molecular material near Sgr A*. We also present dark features in\nradio continuum images coincident with the envelope of IRS 3. These dusty stars\nprovide examples in which high resolution radio continuum images can identify\ndust enshrouded stellar sources embedded an ionized medium.\n", "  We conducted a two-night photometric survey of small Kuiper Belt objects\n(KBOs) near opposition using the wide-field Hyper Suprime-Cam instrument on the\n8.2 m Subaru Telescope. The survey covered about 90 deg^2 of sky, with each\nfield imaged in the g and i bands. We detected 356 KBOs, ranging in absolute\nmagnitude from 6.5 to 10.4. Filtering for high-inclination objects within the\nhot KBO population, we show that the g-i color distribution is strongly\nbimodal, indicative of two color classes - the red and very red subpopulations.\nAfter categorizing objects into the two subpopulations by color, we present the\nfirst dedicated analysis of the magnitude distributions of the individual color\nsubpopulations and demonstrate that the two distributions are roughly identical\nin shape throughout the entire size range covered by our survey. Comparing the\ncolor distribution of small hot KBOs with that of Centaurs, we find that they\nhave similar bimodal shapes, thereby providing strong confirmation of previous\nexplanations for the attested bimodality of Centaurs. We also show that the\nmagnitude distributions of the two KBO color subpopulations and the two color\nsubpopulations observed in the Jupiter Trojans are statistically\nindistinguishable. Finally, we discuss a hypothesis describing the origin of\nthe KBO color bimodality based on our survey results.\n", "  We present a photometric and astrometric study of the split active asteroid\nP/2016 J1 (PANSTARRS). The two components (hereafter J1-A and J1-B) separated\neither $\\sim$1500 days (2012 May to June) or 2300 days (2010 April) prior to\nthe current epoch, with a separation speed $V_{\\mathrm{sep}} = 0.70 \\pm 0.02$ m\ns$^{-1}$ for the former scenario, or $0.83 \\pm 0.06$ m s$^{-1}$ for the latter.\nKeck photometry reveals that the two fragments have similar, Sun-like colors\nwhich are comparable to the colors of primitive C- and G-type asteroids. With a\nnominal comet-like albedo, $p_{R} = 0.04$, the effective, dust-contaminated\ncross sections are estimated to be 2.4 km$^{2}$ for J1-A, and 0.5 km$^{2}$ for\nJ1-B. We estimate that the nucleus radii lie in the range $140 \\lesssim\nR_{\\mathrm{N}} \\lesssim 900$ m for J1-A and $40 \\lesssim R_{\\mathrm{N}}\n\\lesssim 400$ m, for J1-B. A syndyne-synchrone simulation shows that both\ncomponents have been active for 3 to 6 months, by ejecting dust grains at\nspeeds $\\sim$0.5 m s$^{-1}$ with rates $\\sim$1 kg s$^{-1}$ for J1-A and 0.1 kg\ns$^{-1}$ for J1-B. In its present orbit, the rotational spin-up and\ndevolatilization times of 2016 J1 are very small compared to the age of the\nsolar system, raising the question of why this object still exists. We suggest\nthat ice that was formerly buried within this asteroid became exposed at the\nsurface, perhaps via a small impact, and that sublimation torques then rapidly\ndrove it to break-up. Further disintegration events are anticipated due to the\nrotational instability.\n", "  The interaction of a light field with a quantum-mechanical system can be\nstudied in an optically controlled semiconductor quantum dot. When driven by a\ncontinuous light field switched on instantaneously, the quantum dot occupation\nperforms Rabi oscillations. Unlike an atomic system, the quantum dot is coupled\nto phonons, which leads to a damping of the Rabi oscillations. Here we model\nthe time-resolved probe spectra to monitor these dynamics and study the\ninfluence of phonons on the spectra. The spectra consist of up to three peaks,\nsimilar to the Mollow-triplet known from quantum optics. We develop analytical\nequations within a rate equation model and show that they agree excellently\nwith a numerical solution using a well established correlation expansion\napproach.\n", "  We report here on our search for excess power in photometry of Neptune\ncollected by the K2 mission that may be due to intrinsic global oscillations of\nthe planet Neptune. To conduct this search, we developed new methods to correct\nfor instrumental effects such as intrapixel variability and gain variations. We\nthen extracted and analyzed the time-series photometry of Neptune from 49 days\nof nearly continuous broadband photometry of the planet. We find no evidence of\nglobal oscillations and place an upper limit of $\\sim$5 ppm at 1000 \\uhz\\ for\nthe detection of a coherent signal. With an observed cadence of 1-minute and\npoint-to-point scatter less than 0.01\\%, the photometric signal is dominated by\nreflected light from the Sun, which is in turn modulated by atmospheric\nvariability of Neptune at the 2\\% level. A change in flux is also observed due\nto the increasing distance between Neptune and the K2 spacecraft, and solar\nvariability with convection-driven solar p modes present.\n", "  We present modelling of line polarization to study multi-dimensional geometry\nof stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We demonstrate that a\npurely axisymmetric, two-dimensional geometry cannot reproduce a loop in the\nStokes Q-U diagram, i.e., a variation of the polarization angles along the\nvelocities associated with the absorption lines. On the contrary,\nthree-dimensional (3D) clumpy structures naturally reproduce the loop. The fact\nthat the loop is commonly observed in stripped-envelope SNe suggests that SN\nejecta generally have a 3D structure. We study the degree of line polarization\nas a function of the absorption depth for various 3D clumpy models with\ndifferent clump sizes and covering factors. Comparison between the calculated\nand observed degree of line polarization indicates that a typical size of the\nclump is relatively large, >~ 25 % of the photospheric radius. Such large-scale\nclumps are similar to those observed in the SN remnant Cassiopeia A. Given the\nsmall size of the observed sample, the covering factor of the clumps is only\nweakly constrained (~ 5-80 %). The presence of large-scale clumpy structure\nsuggests that the large-scale convection or standing accretion shock\ninstability takes place at the onset of the explosion.\n", "  Conventional definitions of habitability require abundant liquid surface\nwater to exist continuously over geologic timescales. Water in each of its\nthermodynamic phases interacts with solar and thermal radiation and is the\ncause for strong climatic feedbacks. Thus, assessments of the habitable zone\nrequire models to include a complete treatment of the hydrological cycle over\ngeologic time. Here, we use the Community Atmosphere Model from the National\nCenter for Atmospheric Research to study the evolution of climate for an\nEarth-like planet at constant CO2, under a wide range of stellar fluxes from\nF-, G-, and K-dwarf main sequence stars. Around each star we find four stable\nclimate states defined by mutually exclusive global mean surface temperatures\n(Ts); snowball (Ts < 235 K), waterbelt (235 K < Ts < 250 K), temperate (275 K <\nTs < 315 K), and moist greenhouse (Ts > 330 K). Each is separated by abrupt\nclimatic transitions. Waterbelt, temperate, and cooler moist greenhouse\nclimates can maintain open-ocean against both sea-ice albedo and hydrogen\nescape processes respectively, and thus constitute habitable worlds. We\nconsider the warmest possible habitable planet as having Ts ~ 355 K, at which\npoint diffusion limited water-loss could remove an Earth ocean in ~1 Gyr.\nWithout long timescale regulation of non-condensable greenhouse species at\nEarth-like temperatures and pressures, such as CO2, habitability can be\nmaintained for an upper limit of ~2.2, ~2.4 and ~4.7 Gyr around F-, G- and\nK-dwarf stars respectively due to main sequence brightening.\n", "  Synchrotron radiation is widely considered as the origin of the pulsed\nnon-thermal emissions from rotation-powered pulsars in optical and X-ray bands.\nIn this paper, we study the synchrotron radiation emitted by the created\nelectron and positron pairs in the pulsar magnetosphere to constrain on the\nenergy conversion efficiency from the Poynting flux to the particle energy\nflux. We model two pair creation processes, two-photon collision which\nefficiently works in young $\\gamma$-ray pulsars ($\\lesssim10^6$ yr), and\nmagnetic pair creation which is the dominant process to supply pairs in old\npulsars ($\\gtrsim10^6$ yr). Using the analytical model, we derive the maximum\nsynchrotron luminosity as a function of the energy conversion efficiency. From\nthe comparison with observations, we find that the energy conversion efficiency\nto the accelerated particles should be an order of unity in the magnetosphere,\neven though we make a number of the optimistic assumptions to enlarge the\nsynchrotron luminosity. In order to explain the luminosity of the non-thermal\nX-ray/optical emission from pulsars with low spin-down luminosity $L_{\\rm\nsd}\\lesssim10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, non-dipole magnetic field components should\nbe dominant at the emission region. For the $\\gamma$-ray pulsars with $L_{\\rm\nsd}\\lesssim10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, observed $\\gamma$-ray to X-ray and optical\nflux ratios are much higher than the flux ratio between curvature and the\nsynchrotron radiations. We discuss some possibilities such as the coexistence\nof multiple accelerators in the magnetosphere as suggested from the recent\nnumerical simulation results. The obtained maximum luminosity would be useful\nto select observational targets in X-ray and optical bands.\n", "  Many magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere evolve rather slowly so that\nthey can be assumed as (quasi-)static or (quasi-)stationary and represented via\nmagneto-hydrostatic (MHS) or stationary magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria,\nrespectively. While exact 3D solutions would be desired, they are extremely\ndifficult to find in stationary MHD. We construct solutions with magnetic and\nflow vector fields that have three components depending on all three\ncoordinates. We show that the non-canonical transformation method produces\nquasi-3D solutions of stationary MHD by mapping 2D or 2.5D MHS equilibria to\ncorresponding stationary MHD states, i.e., states that display the same field\nline structure as the original MHS equilibria. These stationary MHD states\nexist on magnetic flux surfaces of the original 2D MHS states. Although the\nflux surfaces and therefore also the equilibria have a 2D character, these\nstationary MHD states depend on all three coordinates and display highly\ncomplex currents. The existence of geometrically complex 3D currents within\nsymmetric field-line structures provide the base for efficient dissipation of\nthe magnetic energy in the solar corona by Ohmic heating. We also discuss the\npossibility of maintaining an important subset of non-linear MHS states, namely\nforce-free fields, by stationary flows. We find that force-free fields with\nnon-linear flows only arise under severe restrictions of the field-line\ngeometry and of the magnetic flux density distribution.\n", "  A broad range of membrane proteins display anomalous diffusion on the cell\nsurface. Different methods provide evidence for obstructed subdiffusion and\ndiffusion on a fractal space, but the underlying structure inducing anomalous\ndiffusion has never been visualized due to experimental challenges. We\naddressed this problem by imaging the cortical actin at high resolution while\nsimultaneously tracking individual membrane proteins in live mammalian cells.\nOur data confirm that actin introduces barriers leading to compartmentalization\nof the plasma membrane and that membrane proteins are transiently confined\nwithin actin fences. Furthermore, superresolution imaging shows that the\ncortical actin is organized into a self-similar meshwork. These results present\na hierarchical nanoscale picture of the plasma membrane.\n", "  We compare quasar positions of the auxiliary quasar solution with ICRF2\nsources using different samples and evaluate the influence on the {\\it Gaia}\nDR1 reference frame owing to the Galactic aberration effect over the\nJ2000.0-J20015.0 period. Then we estimate the global rotation between TGAS with\n{\\it Tycho}-2 proper motion systems to investigate the property of the {\\it\nGaia} DR1 reference frame. Finally, the Galactic kinematics analysis using the\nK-M giant proper motions is performed to understand the property of {\\it Gaia}\nDR1 reference frame. The positional comparison between the auxiliary quasar\nsolution and ICRF2 shows negligible orientation and validates the declination\nbias of $\\sim$$-0.1$\\mas~in {\\it Gaia} quasar positions with respect to ICRF2.\nGalactic aberration effect is thought to cause an offset $\\sim$$0.01$\\mas~of\nthe $Z$ axis direction of {\\it Gaia} DR1 reference frame. The global rotation\nbetween TGAS and {\\it Tycho}-2 proper motion systems, obtained by different\nsamples, shows a much smaller value than the claimed value $0.24$\\masyr. For\nthe Galactic kinematics analysis of the TGAS K-M giants, we find possible\nnon-zero Galactic rotation components beyond the classical Oort constants: the\nrigid part $\\omega_{Y_G} = -0.38 \\pm 0.15$\\masyr~and the differential part\n$\\omega^\\prime_{Y_G} = -0.29 \\pm 0.19$\\masyr~around the $Y_G$ axis of Galactic\ncoordinates, which indicates possible residual rotation in {\\it Gaia} DR1\nreference frame or problems in the current Galactic kinematical model.\n", "  Massive stellar clusters provide radiation ($\\mathrm{\\sim\n10^7-10^8~L_{\\odot}}$) and winds ($\\mathrm{\\sim 1000~km/s}$) that act to heat\ndust and shape their surrounding environment. In this paper, the Arched\nFilaments in the Galactic center were studied to better understand the\ninfluence of the Arches cluster on its nearby interstellar medium (ISM). The\nArched Filaments were observed with the Faint Object InfraRed CAMera for the\nSOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) at 19.7, 25.2, 31.5, and 37.1 $\\mu$m.\nColor-temperature maps of the region created with the 25.2 and 37.1 $\\mu$m data\nreveal relatively uniform dust temperatures (70-100 K) over the extent of the\nfilaments ($\\sim 25$ pc). Distances between the cluster and the filaments were\ncalculated assuming equilibrium heating of standard size ISM dust grains\n($\\sim$0.1 $\\mu$m). The distances inferred by this method are in conflict with\nthe projected distance between the filaments and the cluster, although this\ninconsistency can be explained if the characteristic grain size in the\nfilaments is smaller ($\\sim$0.01 $\\mu$m) than typical values. DustEM models of\nselected locations within the filaments show evidence of depleted abundances of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by factors of $\\sim$1.6-10 by mass\ncompared to the diffuse ISM. The evidence for both PAH depletion and a smaller\ncharacteristic grain size points to processing of the ISM within the filaments.\nWe argue that the eroding of dust grains within the filaments is not likely\nattributable to the radiation or winds from the Arches cluster, but may be\nrelated to the physical conditions in the Galactic center.\n", "  We study the B ring's complex optical depth structure. The source of this\nstructure may be the complex dynamics of the Keplerian shear and the\nself-gravity of the ring particles. The outcome of these dynamic effects\ndepends sensitively on the collisional and physical properties of the\nparticles. Two mechanisms can emerge that dominate the macroscopic physical\nstructure of the ring: self-gravity wakes and viscous overstability. Here we\nstudy the interplay between these two mechanisms by using our recently\ndeveloped particle collision method that allows us to better model the\ninter-particle contact physics. We find that for a constant ring surface\ndensity and particle internal density, particles with rough surfaces tend to\nproduce axisymmetric ring features associated with the viscous overstability,\nwhile particles with smoother surfaces produce self-gravity wakes.\n", "  We observed the afterglow of GRB 130427A with the RATIR instrument on the\n1.5-m Harold L. Johnson telescope of the Observatorio Astron\\'omico Nacional on\nSierra San Pedro M\\'artir. Our homogenous $griZYJH$ photometry extends from the\nnight of burst to three years later. We fit a model for the afterglow. There is\na significant positive residual which matches the behavior of SN 1998bw in the\n$griZ$ filters; we suggest that this is a photometric signature of the\nsupernova SN 2013cq associated with the GRB. The peak absolute magnitude of the\nsupernova is $M_r=-18.43\\pm0.11$.\n", "  We present an update to the ultraviolet-to-radio database of global broadband\nphotometry for the 79 nearby galaxies that comprise the union of the KINGFISH\n(Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) and\nSINGS (Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey) samples. The 34-band dataset\npresented here includes contributions from observational work carried out with\na variety of facilities including GALEX, SDSS, PS, NOAO, 2MASS, WISE, Spitzer,\nHerschel, Planck, JCMT, and the VLA. Improvements of note include\nrecalibrations of previously-published SINGS BVRcIc and KINGFISH\nfar-infrared/submillimeter photometry. Similar to previous results in the\nliterature, an excess of submillimeter emission above model predictions is seen\nprimarily for low-metallicity dwarf/irregular galaxies. This 34-band\nphotometric dataset for the combined KINGFISH$+$SINGS sample serves as an\nimportant multi-wavelength reference for the variety of galaxies observed at\nlow redshift. A thorough analysis of the observed spectral energy distributions\nis carried out in a companion paper.\n", "  We report the ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the Class I binary protostellar\nsystem L1551 NE in the 0.9-mm continuum, C18O (3-2), 13CO (3-2), SO (7_8-6_7),\nand the CS (7-6) emission. At 0.18\" (= 25 AU) resolution, ~4-times higher than\nthat of our Cycle 0 observations, the circumbinary disk as seen in the 0.9-mm\nemission is shown to be comprised of a northern and a southern spiral arm, with\nthe southern arm connecting to the circumstellar disk around Source B. The\nwestern parts of the spiral arms are brighter than the eastern parts,\nsuggesting the presence of an m=1 spiral mode. In the C18O emission, the infall\ngas motions in the inter-arm regions and the outward gas motions in the arms\nare identified. These observed features are well reproduced with our numerical\nsimulations, where gravitational torques from the binary system impart angular\nmomenta to the spiral-arm regions and extract angular momenta from the\ninter-arm regions. Chemical differentiation of the circumbinary disk is seen in\nthe four molecular species. Our Cycle 2 observations have also resolved the\ncircumstellar disks around the individual protostars, and the beam-deconvolved\nsizes are 0.29\" X 0.19\" (= 40 X 26 AU) (P.A. = 144 deg) and 0.26\" X 0.20\" (= 36\nX 27 AU) (P.A. = 147 deg) for Sources A and B, respectively. The position and\ninclination angles of these circumstellar disks are misaligned with that of the\ncircumbinary disk. The C18O emission traces the Keplerian rotation of the\nmisaligned disk around Source A.\n", "  Vibration-rotation lines of H$_{2}$ from highly excited levels approaching\nthe dissociation limit have been detected at a number of locations in the\nshocked gas of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC-1), including in a Herbig-Haro\nobject near the tip of one of the OMC-1 \"fingers.\" Population diagrams show\nthat while the excited H$_{2}$ is almost entirely at a kinetic temperature of\n$\\sim$1,800 K, (typical for vibrationally shock-excited H$_{2}$), as in the\npreviously reported case of Herbig-Haro object HH 7 up to a few percent of the\nH$_{2}$ is at a kinetic temperature of $\\sim$5,000~K. The location with the\nlargest fraction of hot H$_{2}$ is the Herbig-Haro object, where the outflowing\nmaterial is moving at a higher speed than at the other locations. Although\ntheoretical work is required for a better understanding of the 5,000 K H$_{2}$,\n(including how it cools), its existence and the apparent dependence of its\nabundance relative to that of the cooler component on the relative velocities\nof the outflow and the surrounding ambient gas appear broadly consistent with\nit having recently reformed. The existence of this high temperature H$_{2}$\nappears to be a common characteristic of shock-excited molecular gas.\n", "  Some short-period, detached binary systems have recently been reported to\nexperience very rapid orbital decay, much faster than is expected from the\nangular-momentum loss caused by gravitational radiation alone. As these systems\ncontain fully convective stars, magnetic braking is not believed to be\noperative, making the large orbital-period derivative puzzling. Here we explore\nwhether a resonant interaction between the binary and a surrounding\ncircumbinary (CB) disk could account for the observed orbital decay. Our\ncalculations indicate that the observed orbital-period derivatives in seven\ndetached binaries can be produced by the resonant interaction between the\nbinary and a CB disk if the latter has a mass in the range of $10^{-4}-10^{-2}~\nM_{\\odot}$, which is of the same order as the inferred disk mass\n($\\sim2.4\\times 10^{-4}~ M_{\\odot}$) in the post-common-envelope binary NN Ser.\n", "  We construct an integral equation for the first crossing distributions for\nfractional Brownian motion in the case of a constant barrier and we present an\nexact analytical solution. Additionally we present first crossing distributions\nderived by simulating paths from fractional Brownian motion. We compare the\nresults of the analytical solutions with both those of simulations and those of\nsome approximated solutions which have been used in the literature. Finally, we\npresent multiplicity functions for dark matter structures resulting from our\nanalytical approach and we compare with those resulting from N-body\nsimulations.\n  We show that the results of analytical solutions are in good agreement with\nthose of path simulations but differ significantly from those derived from\napproximated solutions. Additionally, multiplicity functions derived from\nfractional Brownian motion are poor fits of the those which result from N-body\nsimulations. We also present comparisons with other models which exist in the\nliterature and we discuss different ways of improving the agreement between\nanalytical results and N-body simulations.\n", "  We describe a method to identify inclined water maser disks orbiting massive\nblack holes and to potentially use them to measure black hole masses. Due to\nthe geometry of maser amplification pathways, the minority of water maser disks\nare observable: only those viewed nearly edge-on have been identified,\nsuggesting that an order of magnitude additional maser disks exist. We suggest\nthat inward-propagating masers will be gravitationally deflected by the central\nblack hole, thereby scattering water maser emission out of the disk plane and\nenabling detection. The signature of an inclined water maser disk would be\nnarrow masers near the systemic velocity that appear to emit from the black\nhole position, as identified by the radio continuum core. To explore this\npossibility, we present high resolution (0.07\"-0.17\") Very Large Array line and\ncontinuum observations of 13 galaxies with narrow water maser emission and show\nthat three are good inclined disk candidates (five remain ambiguous). In the\nbest case, for CGCG 120$-$039, we show that the maser and continuum emission\nare coincident to within $3.5\\pm1.4$ pc ($6.7\\pm2.7$ milliarcsec). Subsequent\nvery long baseline interferometric maps can confirm candidate inclined disks\nand have the potential to show maser rings or arcs that provide a direct\nmeasurement of black hole mass, although the mass precision will rely on\nknowledge of the size of the maser disk.\n", "  Fast interplanetary coronal mass ejections (interplanetary CMEs, or ICMEs)\nare the drivers of strongest space weather storms such as solar energetic\nparticle events and geomagnetic storms. The connection between space weather\nimpacting solar wind disturbances associated with fast ICMEs at Earth and the\ncharacteristics of causative energetic CMEs observed near the Sun is a key\nquestion in the study of space weather storms as well as in the development of\npractical space weather prediction. Such shock-driving fast ICMEs usually\nexpand at supersonic speed during the propagation, resulting in the continuous\naccumulation of shocked sheath plasma ahead. In this paper, we propose the\n\"sheath-accumulating propagation\" (SAP) model that describe the coevolution of\nthe interplanetary sheath and decelerating ICME ejecta by taking into account\nthe process of upstream solar wind plasma accumulation within the sheath\nregion. Based on the SAP model, we discussed (1) ICME deceleration\ncharacteristics, (2) the fundamental condition for fast ICME at Earth, (3)\nthickness of interplanetary sheath, (4) arrival time prediction and (5) the\nsuper-intense geomagnetic storms associated with huge solar flares. We\nquantitatively show that not only speed but also mass of the CME are crucial in\ndiscussing the above five points. The similarities and differences among the\nSAP model, the drag-based model and the`snow-plough' model proposed by\n\\citet{tappin2006} are also discussed.\n", "  We report on the detection at $>$98% confidence of an optical counterpart to\nAGC 249525, an Ultra-Compact High Velocity Cloud (UCHVC) discovered by the\nALFALFA blind neutral hydrogen survey. UCHVCs are compact, isolated HI clouds\nwith properties consistent with their being nearby low-mass galaxies, but\nwithout identified counterparts in extant optical surveys. Analysis of the\nresolved stellar sources in deep $g$- and $i$-band imaging from the WIYN pODI\ncamera reveals a clustering of possible Red Giant Branch stars associated with\nAGC 249525 at a distance of 1.64$\\pm$0.45 Mpc. Matching our optical detection\nwith the HI synthesis map of AGC 249525 from Adams et al. (2016) shows that the\nstellar overdensity is exactly coincident with the highest-density HI contour\nfrom that study. Combining our optical photometry and the HI properties of this\nobject yields an absolute magnitude of $-7.1 \\leq M_V \\leq -4.5$, a stellar\nmass between $2.2\\pm0.6\\times10^4 M_{\\odot}$ and $3.6\\pm1.0\\times10^5\nM_{\\odot}$, and an HI to stellar mass ratio between 9 and 144. This object has\nstellar properties within the observed range of gas-poor Ultra-Faint Dwarfs in\nthe Local Group, but is gas-dominated.\n", "  Haze in Pluto's atmosphere was detected in images by both the Long Range\nReconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera\n(MVIC) on New Horizons. LORRI observed haze up to altitudes of at least 200 km\nabove Pluto's surface at solar phase angles from ~20{\\deg} to ~169{\\deg}. The\nhaze is structured with about ~20 layers, and the extinction due to haze is\ngreater in the northern hemisphere than at equatorial or southern latitudes.\nHowever, more haze layers are discerned at equatorial latitudes. A search for\ntemporal variations found no evidence for motions of haze layers (temporal\nchanges in layer altitudes) on time scales of 2 to 5 hours, but did find\nevidence of changes in haze scale height above 100 km altitude. An ultraviolet\nextinction attributable to the atmospheric haze was also detected by the ALICE\nultraviolet spectrograph on New Horizons. The haze particles are strongly\nforward-scattering in the visible, and a microphysical model of haze is\npresented which reproduces the visible phase function just above the surface\nwith 0.5 {\\mu}m spherical particles, but also invokes fractal aggregate\nparticles to fit the visible phase function at 45 km altitude and account for\nUV extinction. A model of haze layer generation by orographic excitation of\ngravity waves is presented. This model accounts for the observed layer\nthickness and distribution with altitude. Haze particles settle out of the\natmosphere and onto Pluto's surface, at a rate sufficient to alter surface\noptical properties on seasonal time scales. Pluto's regional scale albedo\ncontrasts may be preserved in the face of the haze deposition by atmospheric\ncollapse.\n", "  Chondrules are primitive materials in the Solar System. They are formed in\nthe first about 3 Myr of the Solar System's history. This timescale is longer\nthan that of Mars formation, and it is conceivable that protoplanets,\nplanetesimals and chondrules might have existed simultaneously in the solar\nnebula. Due to protoplanets perturbation on the planetesimal dynamics and\nchondrule accretion on them, all the formed chondrules are unlikely to be\naccreted by planetesimals. We investigate the amount of chondrules accreted by\nplanetesimals in such a condition. We assume that a protoplanet is in\noligarchic growth, and we perform analytical calculations of chondrule\naccretion both by a protoplanet and by planetesimals. Through the oligarchic\ngrowth stage, planetesimals accrete about half of the formed chondrules. The\nsmallest planetesimals get the largest amount of the chondrules, compared with\nthe amount accreted by more massive planetesimals. We perform a parameter study\nand find that this fraction is not largely changed for a wide range of\nparameter sets.\n", "  Observations of free-free continuum radio emission of four young\nmain-sequence solar-type stars (EK Dra, Pi1 UMa, Chi1 Ori; and Kappa1 Cet) are\nstudied to detect stellar winds or at least to place upper limits on their\nthermal radio emission, which is dominated by the ionized wind. These stars are\nexcellent proxies for representing the young Sun. Upper limits on mass loss\nrates are calculated using their observational radio emission. Our aim is to\nre-examine the faint young Sun paradox by assuming that the young Sun was more\nmassive in its past, and hence to find a possible solution for this famous\nproblem. The observations of our sample are performed with the Karl G. Jansky\nVLA with excellent sensitivity, using the C-band and the Ku-band. ALMA\nobservations are performed at 100 GHz. For the estimation of the mass loss\nlimits, spherically symmetric winds and stationary, anisotropic, ionized winds\nare assumed. We compare our results to 1) mass loss rate estimates of\ntheoretical rotational evolution models, and 2) to results of the indirect\ntechnique of determining mass loss rates: Lyman-alpha absorption. We are able\nto derive the most stringent direct upper limits on mass loss so far from radio\nobservations. Two objects, EK Dra and Chi1 Ori, are detected at 6 and 14 GHz\ndown to an excellent noise level. These stars are very active and additional\nradio emission identified as non-thermal emission was detected, but limits for\nthe mass loss rates of these objects are still derived. The stars Pi1 UMa and\nKappa1 Cet were not detected in either C-band or in Ku-band. For these objects\nwe give upper limits to their radio free-free emission and calculate upper\nlimits to their mass loss rates. Finally, we reproduce the evolution of the Sun\nand derive an estimate for the solar mass of the Sun at a younger age.\n", "  We report on the detailed analysis of a gravitationally-lensed Y-band\ndropout, A2744_YD4, selected from deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the\nFrontier Field cluster Abell 2744. Band 7 observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) indicate the proximate detection of a significant 1mm\ncontinuum flux suggesting the presence of dust for a star-forming galaxy with a\nphotometric redshift of $z\\simeq8$. Deep X-SHOOTER spectra confirms the high\nredshift identity of A2744_YD4 via the detection of Lyman $\\alpha$ emission at\na redshift $z$=8.38. The association with the ALMA detection is confirmed by\nthe presence of [OIII] 88$\\mu$m emission at the same redshift. Although both\nemission features are only significant at the 4 $\\sigma$ level, we argue their\njoint detection and the positional coincidence with a high redshift dropout in\nthe HST images confirms the physical association. Analysis of the available\nphotometric data and the modest gravitational magnification ($\\mu\\simeq2$)\nindicates A2744_YD4 has a stellar mass of $\\sim$ 2$\\times$10$^9$ M$_{\\odot}$, a\nstar formation rate of $\\sim20$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr and a dust mass of\n$\\sim$6$\\times$10$^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We discuss the implications of the\nformation of such a dust mass only $\\simeq$200 Myr after the onset of cosmic\nreionisation.\n", "  We present a study of the connection between brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs) and their host galaxy clusters. Using galaxy clusters at $0.1<z<0.3$\nfrom the Hectospec Cluster Survey (HeCS) with X-ray information from the\nArchive of {\\it Chandra} Cluster Entropy Profile Tables (ACCEPT), we confirm\nthat BCGs in low central entropy clusters are well aligned with the X-ray\ncenter. Additionally, the magnitude difference between BCG and the 2nd\nbrightest one also correlates with the central entropy of the intracluster\nmedium. From the red-sequence (RS) galaxies, we cannot find significant\ndependence of RS color scatter and stellar population on the central entropy of\nthe intracluster medium of their host cluster. However, BCGs in low entropy\nclusters are systematically less massive than those in high entropy clusters,\nalthough this is dependent on the method used to derive the stellar mass of\nBCGs. In contrast, the stellar velocity dispersion of BCGs shows no dependence\non BCG activity and cluster central entropy. This implies that the potential of\nthe BCG is established earlier and the activity leading to optical emission\nlines is dictated by the properties of the intracluster medium in the cluster\ncore.\n", "  We make use of a Hylleraas-type wave function to derive an exact analytical\nmodel to quantify correlation in two-electron atomic/ionic systems and\nsubsequently employ it to examine the role of inter-electronic repulsion in\naffecting (i) the bare (uncorrelated) single-particle position- and\nmomentum-space charge distributions and (ii) corresponding Shannon's\ninformation entropies. The results presented for the first five members in the\nhelium iso-electronic sequence, on the one hand, correctly demonstrate the\neffect of correlation on bare charge distributions and, on the other hand, lead\nus to some important results for the correlated and uncorrelated values of the\nentropies. These include the limiting behavior of the correlated entropy sum\n(sum of position- and momentum-space entropies) and geometrical realization for\nthe variation of information entropies as a function of Z. We suggest that,\nrather than the entropy sum, individual entropies should be regarded as better\ncandidates for the measure of correlation.\n", "  We examine constraints obtained from SNIa surveys on a two parameter model of\ndark energy in which the equation of state $w (z) = P(z) / \\rho (z)$ undergoes\na transition over a period significantly shorter than the Hubble time. We find\nthat a transition between $w \\sim -0.2$ and $w \\sim -1$ (the first value being\nsomewhat arbitrary) is allowed at redshifts as low as 0.1, despite the fact\nthat data extend beyond $z \\sim 1$. Surveys with the precision anticipated for\nspace experiments should allow only slight improvement on this constraint, as a\ntransition occurring at a redshift as low as $\\sim 0.17$ could still remain\nundistinguishable from a standard cosmological constant. The addition of a\nprior on the matter density $\\Omega_\\MAT = 0.3$ only modestly improves the\nconstraints. Even deep space experiments would still fail to identify a rapid\ntransition at a redshift above 0.5. These results illustrate that a Hubble\ndiagram of distant SNIa alone will not reveal the actual nature of dark energy\nat a redshift above 0.2 and that only the local dynamics of the quintessence\nfield can be infered from a SNIa Hubble diagram. Combinations, however, seem to\nbe very efficient: we found that the combination of present day CMB data and\nSNIa already excludes a transition at redshifts below 0.8.\n", "  Low-frequency radio observations of neutral hydrogen during and before the\nepoch of cosmic reionization will provide ~ 1000 quasi-independent source\nplanes, each of precisely known redshift, if a resolution of ~1 arcminutes or\nbetter can be attained. These planes can be used to reconstruct the projected\nmass distribution of foreground material. Structure in these source planes is\nlinear and gaussian at high redshift (30<z<300) but is nonlinear and\nnongaussian during re ionization. We demonstrate that this structure can, in\nprinciple, be used to make mass images with a formal signal-to-noise per pixel\nexceeding 10, even for pixels as small as an arc-second. With an ideal\ntelescope, both resolution and signal-to-noise can exceed those of even the\nmost optimistic idealized mass maps from galaxy lensing by more than an order\nof magnitude. Individual dark halos similar in mass to that of the Milky Way\ncould be imaged with high signal-to-noise out to z ~ 10. Even with a much less\nambitious telescope, a wide-area survey of 21 cm lensing would provide very\nsensitive constraints on cosmological parameters, in particular on dark energy.\nThese are up to 20 times tighter than the constraints obtainable from\ncomparably sized, very deep surveys of galaxy lensing, although the best\nconstraints come from combining data of the two types. Any radio telescope\ncapable of mapping the 21cm brightness temperature with good frequency\nresolution (~ 0.05 MHz) over a band of width >~ 10 MHz should be able to make\nmass maps of high quality. The planned Square Kilometer Array (SKA) may be able\nto map the mass with moderate signal-to-noise down to arcminute scales,\ndepending on the reionization history of the universe and the ability to\nsubtract foreground sources.\n"]}
