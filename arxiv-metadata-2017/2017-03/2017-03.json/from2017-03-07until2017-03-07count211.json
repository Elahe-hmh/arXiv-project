By\ntreating the $m_s$ effects on both kaon condensate and Fermi-surface phenomenon\nself-consistently, we develop a new treatment to evaluate color neutral\nsolutions within the model-independent framework. It is pointed out that, in\nthe general sense, the expectation values of gluon fields obtained from\ndynamics of Goldstone bosons solely are not identified with the factual color\nchemical potentials.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the question of the global well-posedness and\nscattering for the cubic Klein-Gordon equation $u_{tt}-\\Delta u+u+|u|^2u=0$ in\ndimension $d\\geq5$. We show that if the solution $u$ is apriorily bounded in\nthe critical Sobolev space, that is, $(u, u_t)\\in L_t^\\infty(I;\nH^{s_c}_x(\\R^d)\\times H_x^{s_c-1}(\\R^d))$ with $s_c:=\\frac{d}2-1>1$, then $u$\nis global and scatters. The impetus to consider this problem stems from a\nseries of recent works for the energy-supercritical nonlinear wave equation and\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, the scaling invariance is broken in\nthe Klein-Gordon equation. We will utilize the concentration compactness ideas\nto show that the proof of the global well-posedness and scattering is reduced\nto disprove the existence of the scenario: soliton-like solutions. And such\nsolutions are precluded by making use of the Morawetz inequality, finite speed\nof propagation and concentration of potential energy.\n", "  We report on an investigation into the dynamics of the stripe phase of\nLa5/3Sr1/3CoO4, a material recently shown to have an hour-glass magnetic\nexcitation spectrum. A combination of magnetic susceptibility, muon-spin\nrelaxation and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements strongly suggest that\nthe physics is determined by a disordered configuration of charge and spin\nstripes whose frustrated magnetic degrees of freedom are strongly dynamic at\nhigh temperature and which freeze out in a glassy manner as the temperature is\nlowered. Our results broadly confirm a recent theoretical prediction, but show\nthat the charge quenching remains incomplete well below the charge ordering\ntemperature and reveal, in detail, the manner in which the magnetic degrees of\nfreedom are frozen.\n", "  The increasing pervasiveness of social media creates new opportunities to\nstudy human social behavior, while challenging our capability to analyze their\nmassive data streams. One of the emerging tasks is to distinguish between\ndifferent kinds of activities, for example engineered misinformation campaigns\nversus spontaneous communication. Such detection problems require a formal\ndefinition of meme, or unit of information that can spread from person to\nperson through the social network. Once a meme is identified, supervised\nlearning methods can be applied to classify different types of communication.\nThe appropriate granularity of a meme, however, is hardly captured from\nexisting entities such as tags and keywords. Here we present a framework for\nthe novel task of detecting memes by clustering messages from large streams of\nsocial data. We evaluate various similarity measures that leverage content,\nmetadata, network features, and their combinations. We also explore the idea of\npre-clustering on the basis of existing entities. A systematic evaluation is\ncarried out using a manually curated dataset as ground truth. Our analysis\nshows that pre-clustering and a combination of heterogeneous features yield the\nbest trade-off between number of clusters and their quality, demonstrating that\na simple combination based on pairwise maximization of similarity is as\neffective as a non-trivial optimization of parameters. Our approach is fully\nautomatic, unsupervised, and scalable for real-time detection of memes in\nstreaming data.\n", "  Trending topics are the online conversations that grab collective attention\non social media. They are continually changing and often reflect exogenous\nevents that happen in the real world. Trends are localized in space and time as\nthey are driven by activity in specific geographic areas that act as sources of\ntraffic and information flow. Taken independently, trends and geography have\nbeen discussed in recent literature on online social media; although, so far,\nlittle has been done to characterize the relation between trends and geography.\nHere we investigate more than eleven thousand topics that trended on Twitter in\n63 main US locations during a period of 50 days in 2013. This data allows us to\nstudy the origins and pathways of trends, how they compete for popularity at\nthe local level to emerge as winners at the country level, and what dynamics\nunderlie their production and consumption in different geographic areas. We\nidentify two main classes of trending topics: those that surface locally,\ncoinciding with three different geographic clusters (East coast, Midwest and\nSouthwest); and those that emerge globally from several metropolitan areas,\ncoinciding with the major air traffic hubs of the country. These hubs act as\ntrendsetters, generating topics that eventually trend at the country level, and\ndriving the conversation across the country. This poses an intriguing\nconjecture, drawing a parallel between the spread of information and diseases:\nDo trends travel faster by airplane than over the Internet?\n", "  Some examples of branched Hamiltonians are explored both classically and in\nthe context of quantum mechanics, as recently advocated by Shapere and Wilczek.\nThese are in fact cases of switchback potentials, albeit in momentum space, as\npreviously analyzed for quasi-Hamiltonian chaotic dynamical systems in a\nclassical setting, and as encountered in analogous renormalization group flows\nfor quantum theories which exhibit RG cycles. A basic two-worlds model, with a\npair of Hamiltonian branches related by supersymmetry, is considered in detail.\n", "  We investigate a possibility of realization of structurally stable chaotic\ndynamics in neural systems. The considered model of interacting neurons\nconsists of a pair of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo systems, with the parameters\nbeing periodically modulated in antiphase, so that the neurons undergo\nalternate excitation with a successive transmission of the phase of\noscillations from one neuron to another. It is shown that 4D map arising in a\nstroboscopic Poincare section of the model flow system possesses a hyperbolic\nstrange attractor of the Smale-Williams type. The dynamical regime observed in\nthe system represents a sequence of amplitude bursts, in which the phase\ndynamics of oscillatory spikes is described by chaotic mapping of Bernoulli\ntype. The results are confirmed by numerical calculation of Lyapunov exponents\nand their parameter dependencies, as well as by direct computation of the\ndistributions of angles between stable and unstable tangent subspaces of\nchaotic trajectories.\n", "  Group elements of SU(2) are expressed in closed form as finite polynomials of\nthe Lie algebra generators, for all definite spin representations of the\nrotation group. The simple explicit result exhibits connections between group\ntheory, combinatorics, and Fourier analysis, especially in the large spin\nlimit. Salient intuitive features of the formula are illustrated and discussed.\n", "  As a guideline for experimental tests of the ideal glass transition (Random\nPinning Glass Transition, RPGT) that shall be induced in a system by randomly\npinning particles, we performed first-principle computations within the\nHypernetted chain approximation and numerical simulations of a Hard Sphere\nmodel of glass-former. We obtain confirmation of the expected enhancement of\nglassy behaviour under the procedure of random pinning, which consists in\nfreezing a fraction $c$ of randomly chosen particles in the positions they have\nin an equilibrium configuration. We present the analytical phase diagram as a\nfunction of $c$ and of the packing fraction $\\phi$, showing a line of RPGT\nending in a critical point. We also obtain first microscopic results on\ncooperative length-scales characterizing medium-range amorphous order in Hard\nSpere glasses and indirect quantitative information on a key thermodynamic\nquantity defined in proximity of ideal glass transitions, the amorphous surface\ntension. Finally, we present numerical results of pair correlation functions\nable to differentiate the liquid and the glass phases, as predicted by the\nanalytic computations.\n", "  The study of criminal networks using traces from heterogeneous communication\nmedia is acquiring increasing importance in nowadays society. The usage of\ncommunication media such as phone calls and online social networks leaves\ndigital traces in the form of metadata that can be used for this type of\nanalysis. The goal of this work is twofold: first we provide a theoretical\nframework for the problem of detecting and characterizing criminal\norganizations in networks reconstructed from phone call records. Then, we\nintroduce an expert system to support law enforcement agencies in the task of\nunveiling the underlying structure of criminal networks hidden in communication\ndata. This platform allows for statistical network analysis, community\ndetection and visual exploration of mobile phone network data. It allows\nforensic investigators to deeply understand hierarchies within criminal\norganizations, discovering members who play central role and provide connection\namong sub-groups. Our work concludes illustrating the adoption of our\ncomputational framework for a real-word criminal investigation.\n", "  Online socio-technical systems can be studied as proxy of the real world to\ninvestigate human behavior and social interactions at scale. Here we focus on\nInstagram, a media-sharing online platform whose popularity has been rising up\nto gathering hundred millions users. Instagram exhibits a mixture of features\nincluding social structure, social tagging and media sharing. The network of\nsocial interactions among users models various dynamics including\nfollower/followee relations and users' communication by means of\nposts/comments. Users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and\nthey can \"like\" and comment each piece of information on the platform. In this\nwork we investigate three major aspects on our Instagram dataset: (i) the\nstructural characteristics of its network of heterogeneous interactions, to\nunveil the emergence of self organization and topically-induced community\nstructure; (ii) the dynamics of content production and consumption, to\nunderstand how global trends and popular users emerge; (iii) the behavior of\nusers labeling media with tags, to determine how they devote their attention\nand to explore the variety of their topical interests. Our analysis provides\nclues to understand human behavior dynamics on socio-technical systems,\nspecifically users and content popularity, the mechanisms of users'\ninteractions in online environments and how collective trends emerge from\nindividuals' topical interests.\n", "  The Turing test aimed to recognize the behavior of a human from that of a\ncomputer algorithm. Such challenge is more relevant than ever in today's social\nmedia context, where limited attention and technology constrain the expressive\npower of humans, while incentives abound to develop software agents mimicking\nhumans. These social bots interact, often unnoticed, with real people in social\nmedia ecosystems, but their abundance is uncertain. While many bots are benign,\none can design harmful bots with the goals of persuading, smearing, or\ndeceiving. Here we discuss the characteristics of modern, sophisticated social\nbots, and how their presence can endanger online ecosystems and our society. We\nthen review current efforts to detect social bots on Twitter. Features related\nto content, network, sentiment, and temporal patterns of activity are imitated\nby bots but at the same time can help discriminate synthetic behaviors from\nhuman ones, yielding signatures of engineered social tampering.\n", "  The problem of clustering content in social media has pervasive applications,\nincluding the identification of discussion topics, event detection, and content\nrecommendation. Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and\nclustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering\nprocedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of\ninformation carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based\non multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets\nreflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm\ntakes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including\nnatural language, the social network, and the patterns of information\ndiffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically,\nstructurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on\na variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to\n\"forget\" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation\nof our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics.\nOver a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was\nable to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method\noutperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a\nstate-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the\nunderlying follower network. We finally show that our online learning framework\nis flexible, due to its independence of the adopted clustering algorithm, and\nbest suited to work in a streaming scenario.\n", "  This posting addresses the incorrect information (about my papers) and\nanalysis provided in the following articles: arXiv:1405.4000/Nanotechnology 26,\n245202 (2015), arXiv:1412.7765/Scientific Reports 4, 7553 (2014), Appl.

Exploiting the\ncomplementary information from multiple receive coils, parallel imaging is able\nto recover images from under-sampled k-space data and to accelerate the\nmeasurement. Because parallel magnetic resonance imaging can be used to\naccelerate basically any imaging sequence it has many important applications.\nParallel imaging brought a fundamental shift in image reconstruction: Image\nreconstruction changed from a simple direct Fourier transform to the solution\nof an ill-conditioned inverse problem. This work gives an overview of image\nreconstruction from the perspective of inverse problems. After introducing\nbasic concepts such as regularization, discretization, and iterative\nreconstruction, advanced topics are discussed including algorithms for\nauto-calibration, the connection to approximation theory, and the combination\nwith compressed sensing.\n", "  The notion of non-classical correlations is a powerful contrivance for\nexplaining phenomena exhibited in quantum systems. It is well known, however,\nthat quantum systems are not free to explore arbitrary correlations---the\nchurch of the smaller Hilbert space only accepts monogamous congregants. We\ndemonstrate how to characterize the limits of what is quantum mechanically\npossible with a computable measure, entanglement negativity. We show that\nnegativity only saturates the standard linear monogamy inequality in trivial\ncases implied by its monotonicity under LOCC, and derive a necessary and\nsufficient inequality which, for the first time, is a non-linear higher degree\npolynomial. For very large quantum systems, we prove that the negativity can be\ndistributed at least linearly for the tightest constraint and conjecture that\nit is at most linear.\n", "  Information extracted from social media streams has been leveraged to\nforecast the outcome of a large number of real-world events, from political\nelections to stock market fluctuations. An increasing amount of studies\ndemonstrates how the analysis of social media conversations provides cheap\naccess to the wisdom of the crowd. However, extents and contexts in which such\nforecasting power can be effectively leveraged are still unverified at least in\na systematic way. It is also unclear how social-media-based predictions compare\nto those based on alternative information sources. To address these issues,\nhere we develop a machine learning framework that leverages social media\nstreams to automatically identify and predict the outcomes of soccer matches.\nWe focus in particular on matches in which at least one of the possible\noutcomes is deemed as highly unlikely by professional bookmakers. We argue that\nsport events offer a systematic approach for testing the predictive power of\nsocial media, and allow to compare such power against the rigorous baselines\nset by external sources. Despite such strict baselines, our framework yields\nabove 8% marginal profit when used to inform simple betting strategies. The\nsystem is based on real-time sentiment analysis and exploits data collected\nimmediately before the games, allowing for informed bets. We discuss the\nrationale behind our approach, describe the learning framework, its prediction\nperformance and the return it provides as compared to a set of betting\nstrategies. To test our framework we use both historical Twitter data from the\n2014 FIFA World Cup games, and real-time Twitter data collected by monitoring\nthe conversations about all soccer matches of four major European tournaments\n(FA Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, and Bundesliga), and the 2014 UEFA\nChampions League, during the period between Oct. 25th 2014 and Nov. 26th 2014.\n", "  It is common to attribute a flat rotation curve to our Galaxy. However\nGalazutdinov et al. (2015) in a recent paper have obtained a Keplerian rotation\ncurve for interstellar clouds in outer parts of the Galaxy. They have\ncalculated the distances from equivalent widths of interstellar CaII lines. The\nradial velocity was also measured on the interstellar CaII absorption line.\n  We verify the result by Galazutdinov et al. (2015) basing on observations of\nold open clusters. We propose, that the observations of flat and Keplerian\nrotation curves may be caused by the assumption of circular orbits. The\napplication of formulas derived with the assumption of circular orbits to\nelliptical ones may mimics the flat rotation curve. The interstellar clouds\nwith cross-sections larger than stars may have almost circular orbits, and the\nderived rotation curve will be Keplerian.\n", "  The computer science research community has became increasingly interested in\nthe study of social media due to their pervasiveness in the everyday life of\nmillions of individuals. Methodological questions and technical challenges\nabound as more and more data from social platforms become available for\nanalysis. This data deluge not only yields the unprecedented opportunity to\nunravel questions about online individuals' behavior at scale, but also allows\nto explore the potential perils that the massive adoption of social media\nbrings to our society. These communication channels provide plenty of\nincentives (both economical and social) and opportunities for abuse. As social\nmedia activity became increasingly intertwined with the events in the offline\nworld, individuals and organizations have found ways to exploit these platforms\nto spread misinformation, to attack and smear others, or to deceive and\nmanipulate. During crises, social media have been effectively used for\nemergency response, but fear-mongering actions have also triggered mass\nhysteria and panic. Criminal gangs and terrorist organizations like ISIS adopt\nsocial media for propaganda and recruitment. Synthetic activity and social bots\nhave been used to coordinate orchestrated astroturf campaigns, to manipulate\npolitical elections and the stock market. The lack of effective content\nverification systems on many of these platforms, including Twitter and\nFacebook, rises concerns when younger users become exposed to cyber-bulling,\nharassment, or hate speech, inducing risks like depression and suicide. This\narticle illustrates some of the recent advances facing these issues and\ndiscusses what it remains to be done, including the challenges to address in\nthe future to make social media a more useful and accessible, safer and\nhealthier environment for all users.\n", "  Social media are used as main discussion channels by millions of individuals\nevery day. The content individuals produce in daily social-media-based\nmicro-communications, and the emotions therein expressed, may impact the\nemotional states of others. A recent experiment performed on Facebook\nhypothesized that emotions spread online, even in absence of non-verbal cues\ntypical of in-person interactions, and that individuals are more likely to\nadopt positive or negative emotions if these are over-expressed in their social\nnetwork. Experiments of this type, however, raise ethical concerns, as they\nrequire massive-scale content manipulation with unknown consequences for the\nindividuals therein involved. Here, we study the dynamics of emotional\ncontagion using Twitter. Rather than manipulating content, we devise a null\nmodel that discounts some confounding factors (including the effect of\nemotional contagion). We measure the emotional valence of content the users are\nexposed to before posting their own tweets. We determine that on average a\nnegative post follows an over-exposure to 4.34% more negative content than\nbaseline, while positive posts occur after an average over-exposure to 4.50%\nmore positive contents. We highlight the presence of a linear relationship\nbetween the average emotional valence of the stimuli users are exposed to, and\nthat of the responses they produce. We also identify two different classes of\nindividuals: highly and scarcely susceptible to emotional contagion. Highly\nsusceptible users are significantly less inclined to adopt negative emotions\nthan the scarcely susceptible ones, but equally likely to adopt positive\nemotions. In general, the likelihood of adopting positive emotions is much\ngreater than that of negative emotions.\n", "  Social media have become the main vehicle of information production and\nconsumption online. Millions of users every day log on their Facebook or\nTwitter accounts to get updates and news, read about their topics of interest,\nand become exposed to new opportunities and interactions. Although recent\nstudies suggest that the contents users produce will affect the emotions of\ntheir readers, we still lack a rigorous understanding of the role and effects\nof contents sentiment on the dynamics of information diffusion. This work aims\nat quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion, to understand:\n(i) whether positive conversations spread faster and/or broader than negative\nones (or vice-versa); (ii) what kind of emotions are more typical of popular\nconversations on social media; and, (iii) what type of sentiment is expressed\nin conversations characterized by different temporal dynamics. Our findings\nshow that, at the level of contents, negative messages spread faster than\npositive ones, but positive ones reach larger audiences, suggesting that people\nare more inclined to share and favorite positive contents, the so-called\npositive bias. As for the entire conversations, we highlight how different\ntemporal dynamics exhibit different sentiment patterns: for example, positive\nsentiment builds up for highly-anticipated events, while unexpected events are\nmainly characterized by negative sentiment. Our contribution is a milestone to\nunderstand how the emotions expressed in short texts affect their spreading in\nonline social ecosystems, and may help to craft effective policies and\nstrategies for content generation and diffusion.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the so called carbuncle phenomenon by means of\nnumerical experiments and heuristic considerations. We identify two main\nsources for the carbuncle: instability of the 1d shock position and low\nnumerical viscosity on shear waves. We also describe how higher order\nstabilizes the 1d shock position and, thus, reduces the carbuncle.\n", "  Given a time function $\\tau$ on a spacetime $M$, we define a `null distance\nfunction', $\\hat{d}_\\tau$, built from and closely related to the causal\nstructure of $M$. In basic models with timelike $\\nabla \\tau$, we show that 1)\n$\\hat{d}_\\tau$ is a definite distance function, which induces the manifold\ntopology, 2) the causal structure of $M$ is completely encoded in\n$\\hat{d}_\\tau$ and $\\tau$. In general, $\\hat{d}_\\tau$ is a conformally\ninvariant pseudometric, which may be indefinite. We give an `anti-Lipschitz'\ncondition on $\\tau$, which ensures that $\\hat{d}_\\tau$ is definite, and show\nthis condition to be satisfied whenever $\\tau$ has gradient vectors $\\nabla\n\\tau$ almost everywhere, with $\\nabla \\tau$ locally `bounded away from the\nlight cones'. As a consequence, we show that the cosmological time function of\n[1] is anti-Lipschitz when `regular', and hence induces a definite null\ndistance function. This provides what may be interpreted as a canonical metric\nspace structure on spacetimes which emanate from a common initial singularity,\ne.g. a `big bang'.\n", "  Fashion is a multi-billion dollar industry with social and economic\nimplications worldwide. To gain popularity, brands want to be represented by\nthe top popular models. As new faces are selected using stringent (and often\ncriticized) aesthetic criteria, \\emph{a priori} predictions are made difficult\nby information cascades and other fundamental trend-setting mechanisms.\nHowever, the increasing usage of social media within and without the industry\nmay be affecting this traditional system. We therefore seek to understand the\ningredients of success of fashion models in the age of Instagram. Combining\ndata from a comprehensive online fashion database and the popular mobile\nimage-sharing platform, we apply a machine learning framework to predict the\ntenure of a cohort of new faces for the 2015 Spring\\,/\\,Summer season\nthroughout the subsequent 2015-16 Fall\\,/\\,Winter season. Our framework\nsuccessfully predicts most of the new popular models who appeared in 2015. In\nparticular, we find that a strong social media presence may be more important\nthan being under contract with a top agency, or than the aesthetic standards\nsought after by the industry.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of the study of Sicilian Mafia\norganization by using Social Network Analysis. The study investigates the\nnetwork structure of a Mafia organization, describing its evolution and\nhighlighting its plasticity to interventions targeting membership and its\nresilience to disruption caused by police operations. We analyze two different\ndatasets about Mafia gangs built by examining different digital trails and\njudicial documents spanning a period of ten years: the former dataset includes\nthe phone contacts among suspected individuals, the latter is constituted by\nthe relationships among individuals actively involved in various criminal\noffenses. Our report illustrates the limits of traditional investigation\nmethods like tapping: criminals high up in the organization hierarchy do not\noccupy the most central positions in the criminal network, and oftentimes do\nnot appear in the reconstructed criminal network at all. However, we also\nsuggest possible strategies of intervention, as we show that although criminal\nnetworks (i.e., the network encoding mobsters and crime relationships) are\nextremely resilient to different kind of attacks, contact networks (i.e., the\nnetwork reporting suspects and reciprocated phone calls) are much more\nvulnerable and their analysis can yield extremely valuable insights.\n", "  Two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, boron nitride and transition\nmetal dichalcogenides, have attracted increased interest due to their potential\napplications in electronics and optoelectronics. Thermal transport in\ntwo-dimensional materials could be quite different from three-dimensional bulk\nmaterials. This article reviews the progress on experimental measurements and\ntheoretical modeling of phonon transport and thermal conductivity in\ntwo-dimensional materials. We focus our review on a few typical two-dimensional\nmaterials, including graphene, boron nitride, silicene, transition metal\ndichalcogenides, and black phosphorus. The effects of different physical\nfactors, such as sample size, strain and defects, on thermal transport in\nTwo-dimensional materials are summarized. We also discuss the environmental\neffect on the thermal transport of two-dimensional materials, such as substrate\nand when two-dimensional materials are presented in heterostructures and\nintercalated with inorganic components or organic molecules.\n", "  The well-known Horodecki criterion asserts that a state $\\rho$ on\n$\\mathbf{C}^d \\otimes \\mathbf{C}^d$ is entangled if and only if there exists a\npositive map $\\Phi : \\mathsf{M}_d \\to \\mathsf{M}_d$ such that the operator\n$(\\Phi \\otimes \\mathrm{Id})(\\rho)$ is not positive semi-definite. We show that\nthe number of such maps needed to detect all the robustly entangled states\n(i.e., states $\\rho$ which remain entangled even in the presence of substantial\nrandomizing noise) exceeds $\\exp(c d^3 / \\log d)$. The proof is based on the\n1977 inequality of Figiel--Lindenstrauss--Milman, which ultimately relies on\nDvoretzky's theorem about almost spherical sections of convex bodies. We\ninterpret that inequality as a statement about approximability of convex bodies\nby polytopes with few vertices or with few faces and apply it to the study of\nfine properties of the set of quantum states and that of separable states. Our\nresults can be thought of as geometrical manifestations of the complexity of\nentanglement detection.\n", "  This paper presents our study of the asymptotic behavior of a two-component\nsystem of Brownian motions undergoing certain singular interactions. In\nparticular, the system is a combination of two different types of particles and\nthe mechanical properties and interaction parameters depend on the\ncorresponding type of particles. We prove that the hydrodynamic limit of the\nempirical densities of two types is the solution of a certain quasi-linear\nparabolic partial differential equation known as the Maxwell-Stefan equation.\n", "  The quark saturation behavior at low $Q^2$ is shown in a numeric solution of\nthe DGLAP equation with parton recombination corrections, which resembles the\nwidely discussed JIMWLK saturation of gluons. Our calculation suggests that the\npartonic saturation can be interpreted as a dynamical balance between the\nsplitting and the fusion processes of partons, without any other condensation\nmechanisms added. The nuclear shadowing saturation at small $x$ resulted from\nthe proposed quark saturation is also discussed.\n", "  With the emergence of social networking services, researchers enjoy the\nincreasing availability of large-scale heterogenous datasets capturing online\nuser interactions and behaviors. Traditional analysis of techno-social systems\ndata has focused mainly on describing either the dynamics of social\ninteractions, or the attributes and behaviors of the users. However,\noverwhelming empirical evidence suggests that the two dimensions affect one\nanother, and therefore they should be jointly modeled and analyzed in a\nmulti-modal framework. The benefits of such an approach include the ability to\nbuild better predictive models, leveraging social network information as well\nas user behavioral signals. To this purpose, here we propose the Constrained\nLatent Space Model (CLSM), a generalized framework that combines Mixed\nMembership Stochastic Blockmodels (MMSB) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\nincorporating a constraint that forces the latent space to concurrently\ndescribe the multiple data modalities. We derive an efficient inference\nalgorithm based on Variational Expectation Maximization that has a\ncomputational cost linear in the size of the network, thus making it feasible\nto analyze massive social datasets. We validate the proposed framework on two\nproblems: prediction of social interactions from user attributes and behaviors,\nand behavior prediction exploiting network information. We perform experiments\nwith a variety of multi-modal social systems, spanning location-based social\nnetworks (Gowalla), social media services (Instagram, Orkut), e-commerce and\nreview sites (Amazon, Ciao), and finally citation networks (Cora). The results\nindicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy over state of the art\nmethods, and demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach for\naddressing a variety of different learning problems commonly occurring with\nmulti-modal social data.\n", "  Mechanical metamaterials are engineered materials that gain their remarkable\nmechanical properties, such as negative Poisson's ratios, negative\ncompressibility, phononic bandgaps, and topological phonon modes, from their\nstructure rather than composition. Here we propose a new design principle,\nbased on a uniform soft deformation of the whole structure, to allow\nmetamaterials to be immediately and reversibly transformed between states with\ncontrasting mechanical and acoustic properties. These properties are protected\nby the topological structure of the phonon band of the whole structure and are\nthus highly robust against disorder and noise. We discuss the general\nclassification of all structures that exhibit such soft deformations, and\nprovide specific examples to demonstrate how to utilize soft deformations to\ntransform a system between different regimes such that remarkable changes in\ntheir properties, including edge stiffness and speed of sound, can be achieved.\n", "  We introduce a new network statistic that measures diverse structural\nproperties at the micro-, meso-, and macroscopic scales, while still being easy\nto compute and easy to interpret at a glance. Our statistic, the onion\nspectrum, is based on the onion decomposition, which refines the k-core\ndecomposition, a standard network fingerprinting method. The onion spectrum is\nexactly as easy to compute as the k-cores: It is based on the stages at which\neach vertex gets removed from a graph in the standard algorithm for computing\nthe k-cores. But the onion spectrum reveals much more information about a\nnetwork, and at multiple scales; for example, it can be used to quantify node\nheterogeneity, degree correlations, centrality, and tree- or lattice-likeness\nof the whole network as well as of each k-core. Furthermore, unlike the k-core\ndecomposition, the combined degree-onion spectrum immediately gives a clear\nlocal picture of the network around each node which allows the detection of\ninteresting subgraphs whose topological structure differs from the global\nnetwork organization. This local description can also be leveraged to easily\ngenerate samples from the ensemble of networks with a given joint degree-onion\ndistribution. We demonstrate the utility of the onion spectrum for\nunderstanding both static and dynamic properties on several standard graph\nmodels and on many real-world networks.\n", "  We have carried out a spectroscopic analysis of the far ultraviolet spectra\nof six symbiotic variables. Two systems, LT Del, which has had one recorded\noutburst, and BD-21 3873 (= IV Vir) which has had no recorded outburst, are\nyellow symbiotic systems. Two other systems, V443 Her and RW Hya, have also\nnever had a recorded outburst. Two other symbiotics, StHa190 and CQ Dra, are\nmore strongly interacting with an outburst history. We have studied these\nsystems during their quiescence in order to shed light on the nature of their\nhot components by fitting their archival far ultraviolet spectra with optically\nthick accretion disk models and NLTE model white dwarf photospheres. Using the\ncritical advantage offered by extending wavelength coverage down to the Lyman\nLimit with FUSE spectra, we find that the hot component in RW Hya is a low mass\nwhite dwarf with a surface temperature of 160,000K while the symbiotic system\nCQ Dra is a triple system with a red giant transferring matter to a hot\ncomponent made up of a cataclysmic variable whose white dwarf has a surface\ntemperature of $\\sim$50,000K. Implications are discussed.\n", "  We study the onset of localization from excited states of trapped Bose-\nEinstein Condensates expanding in presence of Gaussian uncorrelated random\ndisorder. In 1D systems, we observe that for a fixed ratio between the disorder\nstrength and the initial energy, excited states localize exponentially with a\nlocalization length that decreases as the energy of the initial state\nincreases. Moreover, the localized state keeps the shape of the initial state\nwave function with an exponential tail. In 2D, we analyze the interplay between\nvorticiy and localization by examining the dispersion of a state containing a\nvortex on it in a disordered media. Despite localization can be associated to\nislands of constant phase, the presence of a vortex in the initial state leads\nto dislocations and phase jumps in the localized state. The study of dispersion\nof a bosonic condensate with vorticity bears similarities to the stability of\ntopological excitations in 2D p-wave fermionic superfluids.\n", "  In theory ratchets enable energy harvesting by rectifying electrical\nfluctuations in conductors and semiconductors. Certain rectification effects in\nnanostructures have been demonstrated earlier. But these were not found to be\nusable for energy harvesting, as they were not accomplished by asymmetric\ntransmission probabilities in the nanochannels, but rather by other secondary\neffects. We propose and experimentally prove a nano-ratchet effect directly\nlinked to an asymmetry in the equilibrium transmission probability, which\nbecomes possible when a magnetic field is present. Remarkably, the\ncurrent/voltage do not disappear even without any intentional external\nexcitation. The rectification is manifested to be highly efficient to the\nextent that generation of energy out of environmental electrical noises is\nachieved.\n", "  As nanoelectronics approaches the nanometer scale, a massive effort is\nunderway to identify the next scalable logic technology beyond Complementary\nMetal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) computing. Such computing technology needs to\nimprove switching energy & delay at reduced dimensions, allow improved\ninterconnects and provide a complete logic/memory family. However, a viable\nbeyond-CMOS logic technology has remained elusive. Here, we propose a scalable\nspintronic logic device which operates via spin-orbit transduction combined\nwith magneto-electric switching. The proposed Magneto-Electric Spin Orbit\n(MESO) logic enables a new paradigm to continue scaling of logic performance to\nnear thermodynamic limits for GHz logic (100 kT switching energy at 100 ps\ndelay). The proposed MESO devices scale strongly and favorably with critical\ndimensions of the device, showing a cubic dependence of switching energy on\nsize, (E_m proportional to W^3), and square dependence on voltage (E_m\nproportional to V^2). The excellent scaling is obtained thanks to the\nproperties of the spin orbit effects (e.g. Inverse Spin Hall Effect (ISHE) and\nInverse Rashba-Edelstein Effect (IREE)) and the dependence of capacitance on\nsize. The operating voltages for these devices are predicted to be < 100 mV\nallowing a significant jump ahead of historic trends of scaling voltage with\nsize and corresponding reduction of energy. Interconnect resistance is a\ncritical obstacle for scaling beyond 10 nm dimensions. We project a less\ndetrimental impact of interconnect resistance and show that MESO logic is\namenable for highly resistive interconnects (100 uOhm.cm-1 mOhm.cm) which opens\na possibility to use nano-metallic (width < bulk electron mean free path) or\ndoped semiconducting wires (width<5 nm). A scalable, CMOS compatible,\nnon-volatile logic family proposed here may enable the next multi-generational\nscaling of computing devices.\n", "  A number of organizations ranging from terrorist groups such as ISIS to\npoliticians and nation states reportedly conduct explicit campaigns to\ninfluence opinion on social media, posing a risk to democratic processes. There\nis thus a growing need to identify and eliminate \"influence bots\" - realistic,\nautomated identities that illicitly shape discussion on sites like Twitter and\nFacebook - before they get too influential. Spurred by such events, DARPA held\na 4-week competition in February/March 2015 in which multiple teams supported\nby the DARPA Social Media in Strategic Communications program competed to\nidentify a set of previously identified \"influence bots\" serving as ground\ntruth on a specific topic within Twitter. Past work regarding influence bots\noften has difficulty supporting claims about accuracy, since there is limited\nground truth (though some exceptions do exist [3,7]). However, with the\nexception of [3], no past work has looked specifically at identifying influence\nbots on a specific topic. This paper describes the DARPA Challenge and\ndescribes the methods used by the three top-ranked teams.\n", "  We investigate the breathing of optical spatial solitons in highly nonlocal\nmedia. Generalizing the Ehrenfest theorem, we demonstrate that oscillations in\nbeam width obey a fourth-order ordinary differential equation. Moreover, in\nactual highly nonlocal materials, the original accessible soliton model by\nSnyder and Mitchell [Science \\textbf{276}, 1538 (1997)] cannot accurately\ndescribe the dynamics of self-confined beams as the transverse size\noscillations have a period which not only depends on power but also on the\ninitial width. Modeling the nonlinear response by a Poisson equation driven by\nthe beam intensity we verify the theoretical results against numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  In solid, the crystalline structure can endow electron an internal degree of\nfreedom known as valley, which characterizes the degenerate energy minima in\nmomentum space. The recent success in optical pumping of valley polarization in\n2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has greatly promoted the concept of\nvalley-based informatics and electronics. However, between the demonstrated\nvalley polarization of transient electron-hole pair excitations and practical\nvalleytronic operations, there exist obvious gaps to fill, among which is the\nvalley pump of long-lived charge carriers. Here we discover that the quested\nvalley pump of electrons or holes can be realized simply by scattering at the\nubiquitous nonmagnetic disorders, not relying on any specific material\nproperty. The mechanism is rooted in the nature of valley as a momentum space\nindex: the intervalley backscattering in general has valley contrasted rate due\nto the distinct momentum transfers, causing a net transfer of population from\none valley to another. As examples, we numerically demonstrate the sizable\nvalley pump effects driven by charge current in nanoribbons of monolayer TMDs,\nwhere the spin-orbit scattering by non-magnetic disorders also realizes spin\npump for the spin-valley locked holes. Our finding points to an unexpected new\nopportunity towards valley-spintronics, turning disorders from a deleterious\nfactor to a resource of valley and spin polarization.\n", "  We have treated numerous illustrative examples of spin relaxation problems\nusing Wigner's phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics of particles and\nspins. The merit of the phase space formalism as applied to spin relaxation\nproblems is that only master equations for the phase-space distributions akin\nto Fokker-Planck equations for the evolution of classical phase-space\ndistributions in configuration space are involved so that operators are\nunnecessary. The explicit solution of these equations can be expanded for an\narbitrary spin Hamiltonian in a finite series of spherical harmonics like in\nthe classical case. The expansion coefficients (statistical moments or averages\nof the spherical harmonics which are obviously by virtue of the\nWigner-Stratonovich map the averages of the polarization operators) may be\ndetermined from differential-recurrence relations in a manner similar to the\nclassical case. Furthermore, the phase space representation via the Weyl\nsymbols of the relevant spin operators suggests how powerful computation\ntechniques developed for Fokker-Planck equations (matrix continued fractions,\nmean first passage time, etc.) may be transparently extended to the quantum\ndomain.\n", "  It is conjectured that dark matter (DM) was produced before inflation from\nneutral particles present after the Big Bang and survived inflation due to a\nspecific coupling with gravitation, while the charged particles existing after\nthe Big Bang disappeared during inflation in a process of charge\nnon-conservation. Ordinary matter was produced at a later stage at a lower\ntemperature following a symmetry restoring phase transition. In this way the\nnon-luminous character of dark matter and the existence of two types of matter,\nordinary and dark, get a natural explanation. Because of the high temperatures\npreceding inflation, the masses of particles produced during that time are too\nlarge to be detected by conventional particle physics methods and possibly will\nnever be detected.\n", "  We combine a general formulation of microswimmmer equations of motion with a\nnumerical bead-shell model to calculate the hydrodynamic interactions with the\nfluid, from which the swimming speed, power and efficiency are extracted. From\nthis framework, a generalized Scallop Theorem emerges. The applicability to\narbitrary shapes allows for the optimization of the efficiency with respect to\nthe swimmer geometry. We apply this scheme to `three-body swimmers' of various\nshapes and find that the efficiency is characterized by the single body\nfriction coefficient in the long-arm regime, while in the short-arm regime the\nminimal approachable distance becomes the determining factor. Next, we apply\nthis scheme to a biologically inspired swimmer that propels itself using a\nrotating helical flagellum. Interestingly, we find two distinct optimal shapes,\none of which is fundamentally different from the shapes observed in nature\n(e.g. bacteria).\n", "  We compute couplings between the $\\rho$-meson and $D$- and $D^\\ast$-mesons -\n$D^{(\\ast)}\\rho D^{(\\ast)}$ - that are relevant to phenomenological\nmeson-exchange models used to analyse nucleon-$D$-meson scattering and explore\nthe possibility of exotic charmed nuclei. Our framework is built from elements\nconstrained by Dyson-Schwinger equation studies in QCD, and therefore expresses\na consistent, simultaneous description of light- and heavy-quarks and the\nstates they constitute, We find that all interactions, including the three\nindependent $D^{\\ast} \\rho \\,D^{\\ast}$ couplings, differ markedly amongst\nthemselves in strength and also in range, as measured by their evolution with\n$\\rho$-meson virtuality. As a consequence, it appears that no single coupling\nstrength or parametrization can realistically be employed in the study of\ninteractions between $D^{(\\ast)}$-mesons and matter.\n", "  Entanglement R\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entropy is an entanglement measure. It\ngeneralizes the entanglement of formation, and they coincide when $\\alpha$\ntends to 1. We derive analytical lower and upper bounds for the entanglement\nR\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entropy of arbitrary dimensional bipartite quantum systems. We\nalso demonstrate the application our bound for some concrete examples.\nMoreover, we establish the relation between entanglement R\\'enyi-$\\alpha$\nentropy and some other entanglement measures.\n", "  Small oscillations evolved a great deal from Klein to Robinson. We propose a\nconcept of solution of differential equation based on Euler's method with\ninfinitesimal mesh, with well-posedness based on a relation of adequality\nfollowing Fermat and Leibniz. The result is that the period of infinitesimal\noscillations is independent of their amplitude.\n  Keywords: harmonic motion; infinitesimal; pendulum; small oscillations\n", "  To evade the well-known impossibility of unconditionally secure quantum\ntwo-party computations, previous quantum private comparison protocols have to\nadopt a third party. Here we study how far we can go with two parties only. We\npropose a very feasible and efficient protocol. Intriguingly, although the\naverage amount of information leaked cannot be made arbitrarily small, we find\nthat it never exceeds 14 bits for any length of the bit-string being compared.\n", "  We present a machine learning framework that leverages a mixture of metadata,\nnetwork, and temporal features to detect extremist users, and predict content\nadopters and interaction reciprocity in social media. We exploit a unique\ndataset containing millions of tweets generated by more than 25 thousand users\nwho have been manually identified, reported, and suspended by Twitter due to\ntheir involvement with extremist campaigns. We also leverage millions of tweets\ngenerated by a random sample of 25 thousand regular users who were exposed to,\nor consumed, extremist content. We carry out three forecasting tasks, (i) to\ndetect extremist users, (ii) to estimate whether regular users will adopt\nextremist content, and finally (iii) to predict whether users will reciprocate\ncontacts initiated by extremists. All forecasting tasks are set up in two\nscenarios: a post hoc (time independent) prediction task on aggregated data,\nand a simulated real-time prediction task. The performance of our framework is\nextremely promising, yielding in the different forecasting scenarios up to 93%\nAUC for extremist user detection, up to 80% AUC for content adoption\nprediction, and finally up to 72% AUC for interaction reciprocity forecasting.\nWe conclude by providing a thorough feature analysis that helps determine which\nare the emerging signals that provide predictive power in different scenarios.\n", "  Using the worldline formalism we compute an effective action for fermions\nunder a temporally modulated electric field and a spatially modulated magnetic\nfield. It is known that the former leads to an enhanced Schwinger Mechanism,\nwhile we find that the latter can also result in enhanced particle production\nand even cause a reorganization of the vacuum to acquire a larger dynamical\nmass in equilibrium which spatially assists the Magnetic Catalysis.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of various tensor network parameterizations\nwithin the Complete Graph Tensor Network States (CGTNS) approach. We extend our\n2-site CGTNS scheme by introducing 3-site correlators. For this we devise three\ndifferent strategies. The first relies solely on 3-site correlators and the\nsecond on 3-site correlators added on top of the 2-site correlator ansatz. To\navoid an inflation of the variational space introduced by higher-order\ncorrelators, we limit the number of higher-order correlators to the most\nsignificant ones in the third strategy. Approaches for the selection of these\nmost significant correlators are discussed. The sextet and doublet spin states\nof the spin-crossover complex manganocene serve as a numerical test case. In\ngeneral, the CGTNS scheme achieves a remarkable accuracy for a significantly\nreduced size of the variational space. The advantages, drawbacks, and\nlimitations of all CGTNS parameterizations investigated are rigorously\ndiscussed.\n", "  Quantum information processors promise fast algorithms for problems\ninaccessible to classical computers. But since qubits are noisy and\nerror-prone, they will depend on fault-tolerant quantum error correction\n(FTQEC) to compute reliably. Quantum error correction can protect against\ngeneral noise if -- and only if -- the error in each physical qubit operation\nis smaller than a certain threshold. The threshold for general errors is\nquantified by their diamond norm. Until now, qubits have been assessed\nprimarily by randomized benchmarking, which reports a different \"error rate\"\nthat is not sensitive to all errors, and cannot be compared directly to diamond\nnorm thresholds. Here we use gate set tomography (GST) to completely\ncharacterize operations on a trapped-Yb$^+$-ion qubit and demonstrate with very\nhigh ($>95\\%$) confidence that they satisfy a rigorous threshold for FTQEC\n(diamond norm $\\leq6.7\\times10^{-4}$).\n", "  We present a theoretical study of Ge-core/Si-shell nanocrystals in a wide\nbandgap matrix and compare the results with experimental data obtained from the\nsamples prepared by co-sputtering. The empirical tight-binding technique allows\nus to account for the electronic structure under strain on the atomistic level.\nWe find that a Si shell as thick as 1 monolayer is enough to reduce the\nradiative recombination rate as a result of valley $L - X$ cross-over. Thin Si\nshell leads to a dramatic reduction of the optical bandgap from visible to\nnear-infrared range, which is promising for photovoltaics and photodetector\napplications. Our detailed analysis of the structure of the confined electron\nand hole states in real and reciprocal spaces indicates that the type-II\nheterostructure is not yet achieved for Si shells with the thickness below 0.8\nnm, despite some earlier theoretical predictions. The energy levels of holes\nare affected by the Si shell stronger than the electron states, even though\nholes are completely confined to the Ge core. This occurs probably due to a\nstrong influence of strain on the band offsets.\n", "  Contextuality in quantum physics provides a key resource for quantum\ninformation and computation. The topological approach in [Abramsky and\nBrandenburger, New J. Phys., 2011, Abramsky et al., CSL 2015, 2015]\ncharacterizes contextuality as \"global inconsistency\" coupled with \"local\nconsistency\", revealing it to be a phenomenon also found in many other fields.\nThis has yielded a logical method of detecting and proving the \"global\ninconsistency\" part of contextuality. Our goal is to capture the other, \"local\nconsistency\" part, which requires a novel approach to logic that is sensitive\nto the topology of contexts. To achieve this, we formulate a logic of local\ninference by using context-sensitive theories and models in regular categories.\nThis provides a uniform framework for local consistency, and lays a foundation\nfor high-level methods of detecting, proving, and moreover using contextuality\nas computational resource.\n", "  The navigation satellite constellations in medium-Earth orbit exist in a\nbackground of third-body secular resonances stemming from the perturbing\ngravitational effects of the Moon and the Sun. The resulting chaotic motions,\nemanating from the overlapping of neighboring resonant harmonics, induce\nespecially strong perturbations on the orbital eccentricity, which can be\ntransported to large values, thereby increasing the collision risk to the\nconstellations and possibly leading to a proliferation of space debris. We show\nhere that this transport is of a diffusive nature and we present representative\ndiffusion maps that are useful in obtaining a global comprehension of the\ndynamical structure of the navigation satellite orbits.\n", "  We consider the tensors generating matrix product states and density\noperators in a spin chain. For pure states, we revise the renormalization\nprocedure introduced by F. Verstraete et al. in 2005 and characterize the\ntensors corresponding to the fixed points. We relate them to the states\npossessing zero correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to\nthose which generate ground states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. For\nmixed states, we introduce the concept of renormalization fixed points and\ncharacterize the corresponding tensors. We also relate them to concepts like\nfinite correlation length, saturation of the area law, as well as to those\nwhich generate Gibbs states of local and commuting Hamiltonians. One of the\nmain result of this work is that the resulting fixed points can be associated\nto the boundary theories of two-dimensional topological states, through the\nbulk-boundary correspondence introduced by Cirac et al. in 2011.\n", "  It is proved that the $n$-twistor expression of a particle's four-momentum\nvector reduces, by a unitary transformation, to the two-twistor expression for\na massive particle or the one-twistor expression for a massless particle.\nTherefore the {\\em genuine} $n$-twistor description of a massive particle in\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space fails for the case $n\\ge3$.\n", "  In the theoretical framework of Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) plus three\nright-handed neutrinos we consider a universal treatment for the mass matrices,\naside from that the active neutrinos acquire their small mass through the\ntype-I seesaw mechanism. Then, as long as a matrix with four-zero texture is\nused to represent the right-handed neutrinos and Yukawa matrices, we obtain a\nunified treatment where all fermion mass matrices have four-zero texture. We\nobtain analytical and explicit expressions for the lepton flavour mixing matrix\nPMNS in terms of fermion masses and parameters associated with the 2HDM-III.\nFurther, we compare these expressions of the PMNS matrix with the most up to\ndate values of masses and mixing in the lepton sector, via a likelihood test\n$\\chi^{2}$. We find that the analytical expressions that we derived reproduce\nremarkably well the most recent experimental data of neutrino oscillations.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger's illustration of an imaginary cat in a box, neither alive nor\ndead, leads to a question of whether and how long a macroscopic quantum\nsuperposition can exist in various situations. It is well known that a\nmacroscopic superposition is destroyed very quickly by environmental effects\ncalled decoherence. On the contrary, it is often believed that a macroscopic\nsuperposition continues to \"survive\" if it is ideally isolated from its\nenvironment. In this paper, using a well-established measure of macroscopic\nsuperpositions and the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, we show that\nmacroscopic superpositions even in ideally closed systems are destroyed by\nthermalization processes. We further investigate specific examples of a\ndisordered Heisenberg spin chain varied between the thermalization phase and\nthe many-body localized (MBL) phase. This leads to consistent results; initial\nmacroscopic superpositions disappear under thermalization while they may be\npreserved in the MBL phase in which thermalization does not occur.\n", "  We give a pedagogical description of the method to extract the charge radii\nand Rydberg constant from laser spectroscopy in regular hydrogen (H) and\ndeuterium (D) atoms, that is part of the CODATA least-squares adjustment (LSA)\nof the fundamental physical constants. We give a deuteron charge radius Rd from\nD spectroscopy alone of 2.1415(45) fm. This value is independent of the\nmeasurements that lead to the proton charge radius, and five times more\naccurate than the value found in the CODATA Adjustment 10. The improvement is\ndue to the use of a value for the 1S->2S transition in atomic deuterium which\ncan be inferred from published data or found in a PhD thesis.\n", "  An integrable deformation of the well-known Neumann-Rosochatius system is\nstudied by considering generalised bosonic spinning solutions on the\neta-deformed AdS_5 x S^5 background. For this integrable model we construct a\n4x4 Lax representation and a set of integrals of motion that ensures its\nLiouville integrability. These integrals of motion correspond to the deformed\nanalogues of the Neumann-Rosochatius integrals and generalise the previously\nfound integrals for the eta-deformed Neumann and (AdS_5 x S^5)_eta geodesic\nsystems. Finally, we briefly comment on consistent truncations of this model.\n", "  The halo of the Milky-Way circumgalactic gas extends up to the virial radius\nof the Galaxy, ~250 kpc. The halo properties may be deduced from X-ray\nspectroscopic observations and from studies of the ram-pressure stripping of\nsatellite dwarf galaxies. The former method is more precise but its results\ndepend crucially on the assumed metallicity of the circumgalactic gas; the\nlatter one does not need these assumptions. Here, the information from both\napproaches is combined to constrain observationally the gas metallicity and\ndensity as functions of the galactocentric distance. It is demonstrated that\nthe two kinds of data could be reconciled if the metallicity decreased to\nZ~0.1Z_Sun in the outer parts of the extended halo. The corresponding gas\ndensity profile is rather flat, falling as r^{-(0.45...0.75)} at large\ngalactocentric distances r.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate spatiotemporal steering of photoelectron\nemission in multiphoton above-threshold single ionization of atoms exposed to a\nphase-controlled orthogonally polarized two-color (OTC) laser pulse. Spatial\nand energy resolved photoelectron angular distributions are measured as a\nfunction of the laser phase, allowing us to look into the fine structures and\nemission dynamics. The slow and fast photoelectrons, distinguished by the\nenergy larger or smaller than 2Up with Up being the ponderomotive energy of a\nfree electron in the laser field, have distinct spatiotemporal dependences of\nthe laser waveform. The phase-of-phase of the slow electron oscillates as\nfunctions of both the energy and emission direction, however, the fast electron\npresent rather flat phase structure which merely depends on its emission\ndirection. Three-dimensional generalized quantum trajectory Monte Carlo\nsimulations are performed to explore the sub-cycle dynamics of the electron\nemission in the phase-controlled OTC pulse.\n", "  The number of times spin s appears in the Kronecker product of n spin j\nrepresentations is computed, and the large n asymptotic behavior of the result\nis obtained. Applications are briefly sketched.\n", "  Social media play an increasingly important role in political communication.\nVarious studies investigated how individuals adopt social media for political\ndiscussion, to share their views about politics and policy, or to mobilize and\nprotest against social issues. Yet, little attention has been devoted to the\nmain actors of political discussions: the politicians. In this paper, we\nexplore the topics of discussion of U.S. President Obama and the 50 U.S. State\nGovernors using Twitter data and agenda-setting theory as a tool to describe\nthe patterns of daily political discussion, uncovering the main topics of\nattention and interest of these actors. We examine over one hundred thousand\ntweets produced by these politicians and identify seven macro-topics of\nconversation, finding that Twitter represents a particularly appealing vehicle\nof conversation for American opposition politicians. We highlight the main\nmotifs of political conversation of the two parties, discovering that\nRepublican and Democrat Governors are more or less similarly active on Twitter\nbut exhibit different styles of communication. Finally, by reconstructing the\nnetworks of occurrences of Governors' hashtags and keywords related to\npolitical issues, we observe that Republicans form a tight core, with a\nstronger shared agenda on many issues of discussion.\n", "  A new proposal is given to control local magnetic field in a molecular\njunction. In presence of finite bias a net circular current is established in\nthe molecular ring which induces a magnetic field at its centre. Allowing a\ndirect coupling between two electrodes, due to their close proximity, and\nchanging its strength we can regulate circular current as well as magnetic\nfield for a wide range, without disturbing any other physical parameters. We\nstrongly believe that our proposal is quite robust compared to existing\napproaches of controlling local magnetic field and can be verified\nexperimentally.\n", "  The spin-orbit interaction of 2D electrons in the quantum wells grown from\nthe III-V semiconductors consists of the two parts with different symmetry: the\nBychkov-Rashba and the Dresselhaus terms. The last term is usually attributed\nto the bulk spin-orbit Hamiltonian which reflects the Td symmetry of the\nzincblende lattice. While it is known that the quantum well interfaces may also\ncontribute to the Dresselhaus term, the exact structure and the relative\nimportance of the interface and the bulk contributions are not well understood\nyet. To compare the bulk contribution with the interface one, we perform\ntight-binding calculations of the spin splittings of the electron levels in\n[100] GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells and analyze the obtained spin splittings within\nthe one-band effective mass electron Hamiltonian containing the two interface\ncontributions to the Dresselhaus term. We show that the dependencies of the\nspin splittings on the quantum well width and the electric field along the\ngrowth direction are perfectly reproduced by the analytical one-band\ncalculations and the magnitude of the interface contribution to the spin-orbit\ninteraction for sufficiently narrow quantum wells is of the same order as the\ncontribution from the bulk Dresselhaus Hamiltonian.\n", "  Nonlinear, multiplicative Langevin equations for a complete set of slow\nvariables in equilibrium systems are generally derived on the basis of the\nseparation of time scales. The form of the equations is universal and\nequivalent to that obtained by Green. An equation with a nonlinear friction\nterm for Brownian motion turns out to be an example of the general results. A\nkey method in our derivation is to use different discretization schemes in a\npath integral formulation and the corresponding Langevin equation, which also\nleads to a consistent understanding of apparently different expressions for the\npath integral in previous studies.\n", "  We give a simple formula for finding the spectral norm of d-mode symmetric\ntensor in two variables over the complex or real numbers in terms of the\ncomplex or real roots of a corresponding polynomial in one complex variable.\nThis result implies that the geometric measure of entanglement of symmetric\nd-qubits is polynomial-time computable. We discuss a generalization to d-mode\nsymmetric tensor in more than two variables.\n", "  We investigate how precisely we can determine the nature of dark energy such\nas the equation of state (EoS) and its time dependence by using future\nobservations of 21 cm fluctuations at the epoch of reionization (6.8 <~ z <~\n10) such as Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and Omniscope in combination with\nthose from cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia\nsupernovae and direct measurement of the Hubble constant. We consider several\nparametrizations for the EoS and find that future 21 cm observations will be\npowerful in constraining models of dark energy, especially when its EoS varies\nat high redshifts.\n", "  We consider a class of zero-range processes exhibiting a condensation\ntransition in the stationary state, with a critical single-site distribution\ndecaying faster than a power law. We present the analytical study of the\ncoarsening dynamics of the system on the complete graph, both at criticality\nand in the condensed phase. In contrast with the class of zero-range processes\nwith critical single-site distribution decaying as a power law, in the present\ncase the role of finite-time corrections are essential for the understanding of\nthe approach to scaling.\n", "  We present a second-order N-electron valence state perturbation theory\n(NEVPT2) based on a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) reference wave\nfunction that exploits a Cholesky decomposition of the two-electron repulsion\nintegrals (CD-DMRG-NEVPT2). With a parameter-free multireference perturbation\ntheory approach at hand, the latter allows us to efficiently describe static\nand dynamic correlation in large molecular systems. We demonstrate the\napplicability of CD-DMRG-NEVPT2 for spin-state energetics of spin-crossover\ncomplexes involving calculations with more than 1000 atomic basis functions. We\nfirst assess in a study of a heme model the accuracy of the strongly- and\npartially-contracted variant of CD-DMRG-NEVPT2 before embarking on resolving a\ncontroversy about the spin ground state of a cobalt tropocoronand complex.\n", "  Recent measurements at the LHC involve the correlation of different azimuthal\nflow harmonics $v_n$. These new observables add constraints to theoretical\nmodels and probe aspects of the system that are independent of the traditional\nsingle-harmonic measurements such as 2- and multi-particle cumulants\n$v_n\\{m\\}$. Many of these new observables have not yet been measured at RHIC,\nleaving an opportunity to make predictions as a test of models across energies.\nWe make predictions using NeXSPheRIO, a hydrodynamical model which has\naccurately reproduced a large set of single-harmonic correlations in a large\nrange of transverse momenta and centralities at RHIC. Our predictions thus\nprovide an important baseline for comparison to correlations of flow harmonics,\nwhich contain non-trivial information about the initial state as well as QGP\ntransport properties. We also point out significant biases that can appear when\nusing wide centrality bins and non-trivial event weighting, necessitating care\nin performing experimental analyses and in comparing theoretical calculations\nto these measurements.\n", "  Single particle transverse mass spectra and HBT radii of identical pion and\nidentical kaon are analyzed with a blast-wave parametrization under the\nassumptions local thermal equilibrium and transverse expansion. Under the\nassumptions, temperature parameter $T$ and transverse expansion rapidity $\\rho$\nare sensitive to the shapes of transverse mass $m_\\text T$ spectrum and HBT\nradius $R_\\text{s}(K_\\text T)$. Negative and positive correlations between $T$\nand $\\rho$ are observed by fitting $m_\\text{T}$ spectrum and HBT radius\n$R_\\text s (K_\\text T)$, respectively. For a Monte Carlo simulation using the\nblast-wave function, $T$ and $\\rho$ are extracted by fitting $m_T$ spectra and\nHBT radii together utilizing a combined optimization function $\\chi^2$. With\nthis method, $T$ and $\\rho$ of the Monte Carlo sources can be extracted. Using\nthis method for A Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) at RHIC energy, the\ndifferences of $T$ and $\\rho$ between pion and kaon are observed obviously, and\nthe tendencies of $T$ and $\\rho$ vs collision energy $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}}$ are\nsimilar with the results extracted directly from the AMPT model.\n", "  We study the evolution of magnetic excitations in the disordered\ntwo-dimensional antiferromagnet Sr2Ir1-xRuxO4. A gigantic magnetic gap greater\nthan 40 meV opens at x = 0.27 and increases with Ru concentration, rendering\nthe dispersive magnetic excitations in Sr2IrO4 almost momentum independent. Up\nto a Ru concentration of x = 0.77, both experiments and first-principles\ncalculations show the Ir Jeff = 1/2 state remains intact. The magnetic gap\narises from the local interaction anisotropy in the proximity of the Ru\ndisorder. Under the coherent potential approximation, we reproduce the\nexperimental magnetic excitations using the disordered Heisenberg\nantiferromagnetic model with suppressed next-nearest neighbor ferromagnetic\ncoupling.\n", "  A general formulation of the problem of calculating the spectrum of stable\nand unstable eigenmodes of linearized perturbations about a magnetically\nconfined toroidal plasma is presented. The analysis is based on a new\nhydromagnetic dynamical model, Multi-region Relaxed Magnetohydrodynamics\n(MRxMHD), which models the plasma-magnetic field system as consisting of\nmultiple regions, containing compressible Euler fluid and Taylor-relaxed\nmagnetic field, separated by flexible ideal-MHD current sheets. This is\nillustrated using a first-principles analysis of a two-region slab geometry,\nwith periodic boundary conditions to model the outer regions of typical tokamak\nor reversed-field pinch plasmas. The lowest and second-lowest eigenvalues in\nplasmas unstable to tearing and kink-tearing modes are calculated. Very near\nmarginal stability the lowest mode obtained using the incompressible\napproximation to the kinetic energy normalization of the present study is shown\nto correspond to the eigenvalues found in previous studies with less physical\nnormalizations.\n", "  Matter-wave interferometry is a highly sensitive tool to measure small\nperturbations in a quantum system. This property allows the creation of\nprecision sensors for dephasing mechanisms such as mechanical vibrations. They\nare a challenge for phase measurements under perturbing conditions that cannot\nbe perfectly decoupled from the interferometer, e.g. for mobile interferometric\ndevices or vibrations with a broad frequency range. Here, we demonstrate a\nmethod based on second-order correlation theory in combination with Fourier\nanalysis, to use an electron interferometer as a sensor that precisely\ncharacterizes the mechanical vibration spectrum of the interferometer. Using\nthe high spatial and temporal single-particle resolution of a delay line\ndetector, the data allows to reveal the original contrast and spatial\nperiodicity of the interference pattern from \"washed-out\" matter-wave\ninterferograms that have been vibrationally disturbed in the frequency region\nbetween 100 and 1000 Hz. Other than with electromagnetic dephasing, due to\nexcitations of higher harmonics and additional frequencies induced from the\nenvironment, the parts in the setup oscillate with frequencies that can be\ndifferent to the applied ones. The developed numerical search algorithm is\ncapable to determine those unknown oscillations and corresponding amplitudes.\nThe technique can identify vibrational dephasing and decrease damping and\nshielding requirements in electron, ion, neutron, atom and molecule\ninterferometers that generate a spatial fringe pattern on the detector plane.\n", "  The asymmetric electron dispersion in type-II Weyl semimetal theoretically\nhosts anisotropic transport properties. Here we observe the significant\nanisotropic Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly in the Fermi-level delicately\nadjusted WTe$_{1.98}$ crystals. Quantitatively, $C_w$ , a coefficient\nrepresenting intensity of ABJ anomaly, along a- and b-axis of WTe$_{1.98}$ are\n0.030 and 0.051 T$^{-2}$ at 2 K, respectively. We found that\ntemperature-sensitive ABJ anomaly is attributed to topological phase transition\nfrom type-II Weyl semimetal to trivial semimetal, which is verified by\nfirst-principles calculation using experimentally determined lattice parameters\nat different temperatures. Theoretical electrical transport study reveals that\nobservation of ansotropic ABJ both along a- and b-axis in WTe$_{1.98}$ is\nattributed to electrical transport in the quasi-classical regime. Our work may\nsuggest that electron-doped WTe$_2$ is an ideal playground to explore the novel\nproperties in type-II Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We investigate electromagnetic propagation in uniaxial dielectrics with a\ntransversely varying orientation of the optic axis, the latter staying\northogonal everywhere to the propagation direction. In such a geometry, the\nfield experiences no refractive index gradients, yet it acquires a\ntransversely-modulated Pancharatnam-Berry phase, that is, a geometric phase\noriginating from a spin-orbit interaction. We show that the periodic evolution\nof the geometric phase versus propagation gives rise to a\nlongitudinally-invariant effective potential. In certain configurations, this\ngeometric phase can provide transverse confinement and waveguiding. The\ntheoretical findings are tested and validated against numerical simulations of\nthe complete Maxwell's equations. Our results introduce and illustrate the role\nof geometric phases on electromagnetic propagation over distances well\nexceeding the diffraction length, paving the way to a whole new family of\nguided waves and waveguides which do not rely on refractive index tailoring.\n", "  We discuss the propagation of an electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneously\nanisotropic material where the optic axis is rotated in the transverse plane\nbut is invariant along the propagation direction. In such a configuration, the\nevolution of an electromagnetic wavepacket is governed by the\nPancharatnam-Berry phase (PBP), responsible for the appearance of an effective\nphotonic potential. In a recent paper [A. Alberucci et al., \"Electromagnetic\nconfinement via spin-orbit interaction in anisotropic dielectrics\", ACS\nPhotonics \\textbf{3}, 2249 (2016)] we demonstrated that the effective potential\nsupports transverse confinement. Here we find the profile of the quasi-modes\nand show that the photonic potential arises from the Kapitza effect of light.\nThe theoretical results are confirmed by numerical simulations, accounting for\nthe medium birefringence. Finally, we analyze in detail a configuration able to\nsupport non-leaky guided modes.\n", "  We calculate that an appropriate modification of the field associated with\nonly one of the photons of a photon pair can suppress generation of the pair\nentirely. From this general result, we develop a method for suppressing the\ngeneration of undesired photon pairs utilizing photonic stop bands. For a\nthird-order nonlinear optical source of frequency-degenerate photons we\ncalculate the modified frequency spectrum (joint spectral intensity) and show a\nsignificant increase in a standard metric, the coincidence to accidental ratio.\nThese results open a new avenue for photon-pair frequency correlation\nengineering.\n", "  The Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics is a generalization of Maxwell theory with\nreduced gauge invariance. It allows to couple the electromagnetic field to a\ncharge which is not locally conserved, and has an additional degree of freedom,\nthe scalar field $S=\\partial_\\alpha A^\\alpha$, usually interpreted as a\nlongitudinal wave component. By re-formulating the theory in a compact\nLagrangian formalism, we are able to eliminate $S$ explicitly from the dynamics\nand we obtain generalized Maxwell equation with interesting properties: they\ngive $\\partial_\\mu F^{\\mu \\nu}$ as the (conserved) sum of the (possibly\nnon-conserved) physical current density $j^\\nu$, and a \"secondary\" current\ndensity $i^\\nu$ which is a non-local function of $j^\\nu$. This implies that any\nnon-conservation of $j^\\nu$ is effectively \"censored\" by the observable field\n$F^{\\mu \\nu}$, and yet it may have real physical consequences. We give examples\nof stationary solutions which display these properties. Possible applications\nare to systems where local charge conservation is violated due to anomalies of\nthe ABJ kind or to macroscopic quantum tunnelling with currents which do not\nsatisfy a local continuity equation.\n", "  We report the first laser spectroscopy of the $^1$S$_0$ to $^3$D$_1$ clock\ntransition in $^{175}$Lu$^+$. Clock operation is demonstrated on three pairs of\nZeeman transitions, one pair from each hyperfine manifold of the $^3$D$_1$\nterm. We measure the hyperfine intervals of the $^3$D$_1$ to 10 ppb uncertainty\nand infer the optical frequency averaged over the three hyperfine transitions\nto be 353.639 915 952 2 (6) THz. The lifetime of the $^3$D$_1$ state is\ninferred to be $174^{+23}_{-32}$ hours from the M1 coupling strength.\n", "  We explore the entire form of S-Matrix elements of a potential $C_{n-1}$\nRamond-Ramond (RR) form field, a tachyon and two transverse scalar fields on\nboth world volume and transverse directions of type IIB and IIA superstring\ntheories. Apart from $<V_{C^{-2}}V_{\\phi^{0}}V_{\\phi ^{0}}V_{T ^{0}}>$ the\nother scattering amplitude, namely $<V_{C^{-1}}V_{\\phi^{-1}}V_{\\phi ^{0}}V_{T\n^{0}}>$ is also revealed. We then start to compare all singularity structures\nof symmetric and asymmetric analysis, generating all infinite singularity\nstructures as well as all order $\\alpha'$ contact interactions on the whole\ndirections. This leads to deriving various new contact terms and several new\nrestricted Bianchi identities in both type IIB and IIA. It is also shown that\njust some of the new couplings of type IIB (IIA) string theory can be\nre-verified in an Effective Field Theory (EFT) by pull-back of branes. To\nconstruct the rest of S-matrix elements one needs to first derive restricted\nworld volume (or bulk) Bianchi identities and then discover new EFT couplings\nin both type IIB and IIA. Finally the presence of commutator of scalar fields\ninside the exponential of Wess-Zumino action for non-BPS branes has been\nconfirmed as well.\n", "  Motivated by advances in the manipulation and detection of ultracold atoms\nwith multiple internal degrees of freedom, we present a finite-temperature\nlattice Monte Carlo calculation of the density and pressure equations of state,\nas well as Tan's contact, of attractively interacting SU(4)- and\nSU(6)-symmetric fermion systems in one spatial dimension. We also furnish a\nnonperturbative proof of a universal relation whereby quantities computable in\nthe SU(2) case completely determine the virial coefficients of the SU($N_f$)\ncase. These one-dimensional systems are appealing because they can be\nexperimentally realized in highly constrained traps and because of the dominant\nrole played by correlations. The latter are typically nonperturbative and are\ncrucial for understanding ground states and quantum phase transitions. While\nquantum fluctuations are typically overpowered by thermal ones in one and two\ndimensions at any finite temperature, we find that quantum effects do leave\ntheir imprint in thermodynamic quantities. Our calculations show that the\nadditional degrees of freedom, relative to the SU(2) case, provide a dramatic\nenhancement of the density and pressure (in units of their noninteracting\ncounterparts) in a wide region around vanishing $\\beta\\mu$, where $\\beta$ is\nthe inverse temperature and $\\mu$ the chemical potential. As shown recently in\nexperiments, the thermodynamics we explore here can be measured in a controlled\nand precise fashion in highly constrained traps and optical lattices. Our\nresults are a prediction for such experiments in one dimension with atoms of\nhigh nuclear spin.\n", "  We present a state-interaction approach for matrix product state (MPS) wave\nfunctions in a nonorthogonal molecular orbital basis. Our approach allows us to\ncalculate for example transition and spin-orbit coupling matrix elements\nbetween arbitrary electronic states provided that they share the same\none-electron basis functions and active orbital space, respectively. The key\nelement is the transformation of the MPS wave functions of different states\nfrom a nonorthogonal to a biorthonormal molecular orbital basis representation\nexploiting a sequence of non-unitary transformations following a proposal by\nMalmqvist (Int. J. Quantum Chem. 30, 479 (1986)). This is well-known for\ntraditional wave-function parametrizations but has not yet been exploited for\nMPS wave functions.\n", "  St\\\"uckelberg interferometry describes the interference of two strongly\ncoupled modes during a double passage through an avoided energy level crossing.\nIn this work, we experimentally investigate finite time effects in\nSt\\\"uckelberg interference and provide an exact analytical solution of the\nSt\\\"uckelberg problem. Approximating this solution in distinct limits reveals\nuncharted parameter regimes of St\\\"uckelberg interferometry. Experimentally, we\nstudy these regimes using a purely classical, strongly coupled nanomechanical\ntwo-mode system of high quality factor. The classical two-mode system consists\nof the in-plane and out-of-plane fundamental flexural mode of a high stress\nsilicon nitride string resonator, coupled via electric gradient fields. The\ndielectric control and microwave cavity enhanced universal transduction of the\nnanoelectromechanical system allows for the experimental access to all\ntheoretically predicted St\\\"uckelberg parameter regimes. We exploit our\nexperimental and theoretical findings by studying the onset of St\\\"uckelberg\ninterference in dependence of the characteristic system control parameters and\nobtain characteristic excitation oscillations between the two modes even\nwithout the explicit need of traversing the avoided crossing. The presented\ntheory is not limited to classical mechanical two-mode systems but can be\napplied to every strongly coupled (quantum) two-level system, for example a\nspin-1/2 system or superconducting qubit.\n", "  We discuss Bragg scattering on both Bose and Fermi gases with strong\nshort-range interactions in the deep inelastic regime of large wave vector\ntransfer $q$, where the dynamic structure factor is dominated by a resonance\nnear the free-particle energy $\\hbar\\omega=\\varepsilon_{\\bf q}=\\hbar^2q^2/2m$.\nUsing a systematic short-distance expansion, the structure factor at high\nmomentum is shown to exhibit a nontrivial dependence on frequency characterized\nby two separate scaling regimes. First, for frequencies that differ from the\nsingle-particle energy by terms of order ${\\cal O}(q)$ (i.e., small deviations\ncompared to the single-particle energy), the dynamic structure factor is\ndescribed by the impulse approximation of Hohenberg and Platzman. Second,\ndeviations of order ${\\cal O}(q^2)$ (i.e., of the same order or larger than the\nsingle-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a\nuniversal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with a\nnumber of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an\nexact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large\nmomentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [JETP 7, 299\n(1958)] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering\nlength $a$. The shift exhibits a maximum around $qa \\simeq 1$, which is\nconnected with a maximum in the static structure factor due to strong\nshort-range correlations. For Bose gases with moderate interaction strengths,\nthe theoretically predicted shift is consistent with the value observed by Papp\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 135301 (2008)]. Finally, we develop a\ndiagrammatic theory for the dynamic structure factor which accounts for the\ncorrelations beyond Bogoliubov theory and which covers the full range of\nmomenta and frequencies, showing the correct asymptotic scaling at large\nmomentum.\n", "  Mergers and the spin of the dark matter halo are factors traditionally\nbelieved to determine the morphology of galaxies within a $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. We study this hypothesis by considering approximately 18,000 central\ngalaxies at $z=0$ with stellar masses $M_{\\ast} = 10^{9}-10^{12} \\, {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ selected from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation.\nThe fraction of accreted stars -- which measures the importance of massive,\nrecent and dry mergers -- increases steeply with galaxy stellar mass, from less\nthan 5 per cent in dwarfs to 80 per cent in the most massive objects, and the\nimpact of mergers on galaxy morphology increases accordingly. For galaxies with\n$M_{\\ast} \\gtrsim 10^{11} \\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, mergers have the expected\neffect: if gas-poor they promote the formation of spheroidal galaxies, whereas\ngas-rich mergers favour the formation and survivability of massive discs. This\ntrend, however, breaks at lower masses. For objects with $M_{\\ast} \\lesssim\n10^{11} \\, {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, mergers do not seem to play any significant role\nin determining the morphology, with accreted stellar fractions and mean merger\ngas fractions that are indistinguishable between spheroidal and disc-dominated\ngalaxies. On the other hand, halo spin correlates with morphology primarily in\nthe least massive objects in the sample ($M_{\\ast} \\lesssim 10^{10} \\, {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$), but only weakly for galaxies above that mass. Our results support\na scenario where (1) mergers play a dominant role in shaping the morphology of\nmassive galaxies, (2) halo spin is important for the morphology of dwarfs, and\n(3) the morphology of medium-sized galaxies -- including the Milky Way -- shows\nlittle dependence on galaxy assembly history or halo spin, at least when these\ntwo factors are considered individually.\n", "  We consider strained graphene, modelled by the two-dimensional massive Dirac\noperator, with potentials corresponding to charge distributions with vanishing\ntotal charge, non-vanishing dipole moment and finitely many point charges of\nsubcritical coupling constants located in the graphene sheet. We show that the\nbound state energies accumulate exponentially fast at the edges of the spectral\ngap by determining the leading order of the accumulation rate.\n", "  We study an one dimensional model where an interface is the stationary\nsolution of a mesoscopic non local evolution equation which has been derived by\na microscopic stochastic spin system. Deviations from this evolution equation\ncan be quantified by obtaining the large deviations cost functional from the\nunderlying stochastic process. For such a functional, derived in a companion\npaper, we investigate the optimal way for a macroscopic interface to move from\nan initial to a final position distant by R within fixed time T. We find that\nfor small values of R/T the interface moves with a constant speed, while for\nlarger values there appear nucleations of the other phase ahead of the front.\n", "  Dry and wet drawing materials were investigated by THz time-domain\nspectroscopy in transmission mode. Carbon-based and iron-gall inks have been\nstudied, some prepared following ancient recipes and others using current\nsynthetic materials; a commercial ink was studied as well. We measured the THz\nsignals on thin film of liquid inks deposited on polyethylene pellicles,\ncomparing the results with the thick pellets of dried inks blended with\npolyethylene powder. This study required the implementation of a new\nexperimental method and data analysis procedure able to provide a reliable\nextraction of the material transmission parameters from a structured sample\ncomposed of thin layers, down to thickness of few tens of micrometers. THz\nmeasurements on thin ink layers enabled the determination of both the\nabsorption and the refractive index in an absolute scale in the 0.1 - 3 THz\nrange, as well as the layer thickness. THz spectroscopic features of a paper\nsheet dyed by one of the iron-gall inks were also investigated. Our results\nshowed that THz time-domain spectroscopy enables to discriminate the various\ninks on different supports, including the application on paper, together with a\nproper determination of the absorption coefficients and indices of refraction.\n", "  We investigate the occurrence of magnetic and charge density wave\ninstabilities in rhombohedral-stacked multilayer (three to eight layers)\ngraphene by first principles calculations including exact exchange. Neglecting\nspin-polarization, an extremely flat surface band centered at the special point\n${\\bf K}$ of the Brillouin zone occurs at the Fermi level. Spin polarization\nopens a gap in the surface state by stabilizing an antiferromagnetic state. The\ntop and the bottom surface layers are weakly ferrimagnetic in-plane (net\nmagnetization smaller than $10^{-3}\\mu_B$), and are antiferromagnetic coupled\nto each other. This coupling is propagated by the out-of-plane\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the nearest neighbors. The gap is very small\nin a spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation, while it is\nproportional to the amount of exact exchange in hybrid functionals. For\ntrilayer rhombohedral graphene it is $38.6$ meV in PBE0, in agreement with the\n$42$ meV gap found in experiments. We study the temperature and doping\ndependence of the magnetic gap. At electron doping of $n \\sim 7 \\times 10^{11}$\ncm$^{-2}$ the gap closes. Charge density wave instabilities with\n$\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ periodicity do not occur.\n", "  The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describes the dynamics of a damped\nmagnetization vector that can be understood as a generalization of Larmor spin\nprecession. The LLG equation cannot be deduced from the Hamiltonian framework,\nby introducing a coupling to a usual bath, but requires the introduction of\nadditional constraints. It is shown that these constraints can be formulated\nelegantly and consistently in the framework of dissipative Nambu mechanics.\nThis has many consequences for both the variational principle and for\ntopological aspects of hidden symmetries that control conserved quantities. We\nparticularly study how the damping terms of dissipative Nambu mechanics affect\nthe consistent interaction of magnetic systems with stochastic reservoirs and\nderive a master equation for the magnetization. The proposals are supported by\nnumerical studies using symplectic integrators that preserve the topological\nstructure of Nambu equations. These results are compared to computations\nperformed by direct sampling of the stochastic equations and by using closure\nassumptions for the moment equations, deduced from the master equation.\n", "  Vector-like quarks are featured by a wealth of beyond the Standard Model\ntheories and are consequently an important goal of many LHC searches for new\nphysics. Those searches, as well as most related phenomenological studies,\nhowever rely on predictions evaluated at the leading-order accuracy in QCD and\nconsider well-defined simplified benchmark scenarios. Adopting an effective\nbottom-up approach, we compute next-to-leading-order predictions for\nvector-like-quark pair-production and single production in association with\njets, with a weak or with a Higgs boson in a general new physics setup. We\nadditionally compute vector-like-quark contributions to the production of a\npair of Standard Model bosons at the same level of accuracy. For all processes\nunder consideration, we focus both on total cross sections and on differential\ndistributions, most these calculations being performed for the first time in\nour field. As a result, our work paves the way to precise extraction of\nexperimental limits on vector-like quarks thanks to an accurate control of the\nshapes of the relevant observables and emphasize the extra handles that could\nbe provided by novel vector-like-quark probes never envisaged so far\n", "  Reconstructing weighted networks from partial information is necessary in\nmany important circumstances, e.g. for a correct estimation of systemic risk.\nIt has been shown that, in order to achieve an accurate reconstruction, it is\ncrucial to reliably replicate the empirical degree sequence, which is however\nunknown in many realistic situations. More recently, it has been found that the\nknowledge of the degree sequence can be replaced by the knowledge of the\nstrength sequence, which is typically accessible, complemented by that of the\ntotal number of links, thus considerably relaxing the observational\nrequirements. Here we further relax these requirements and devise a procedure\nvalid when even the the total number of links is unavailable. We assume that,\napart from the heterogeneity induced by the degree sequence itself, the network\nis homogeneous, so that its (global) link density can be estimated by sampling\nsubsets of nodes with representative density. We show that the best way of\nsampling nodes is the random selection scheme, any other procedure being biased\ntowards unrealistically large, or small, link densities. We then introduce our\ncore technique for reconstructing both the topology and the link weights of the\nunknown network in detail. When tested on real economic and financial data\nsets, our method achieves a remarkable accuracy and is very robust with respect\nto the sampled subsets, thus representing a reliable practical tool whenever\nthe available topological information is restricted to small portions of nodes.\n", "  The `optimal' factorization scale $\\mu_0$ is calculated for open heavy quark\nproduction. We find that the optimal value is $\\mu_F=\\mu_0\\simeq\n0.85\\sqrt{p^2_T+m_Q^2} $; a choice which allows us to resum the\ndouble-logarithmic, $(\\alpha_s\\ln\\mu^2_F\\ln(1/x))^n$ corrections (enhanced at\nLHC energies by large values of $\\ln(1/x)$) and to move them into the incoming\nparton distributions, PDF$(x,\\mu_0^2)$. Besides this result for the single\ninclusive cross section (corresponding to an observed heavy quark of transverse\nmomentum $p_T$), we also determined the scale for processes where the\nacoplanarity can be measured; that is, events where the azimuthal angle between\nthe quark and the antiquark may be determined experimentally. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the important role played by the $2\\to 2$ subprocesses, $gg\\to\nQ\\bar{Q}$ at NLO and higher orders. In summary, we achieve a better stability\nof the QCD calculations, so that the data on $c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$\nproduction can be used to further constrain the gluons in the small $x$,\nrelatively low scale, domain, where the uncertainties of the global analyses\nare large at present.\n", "  Existence of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes whose minimal\ndistance scales linearly with the number of qubits is a major open problem in\nquantum information. Its practical interest stems from the need to protect\ninformation in a future quantum computer, and its theoretical appeal relates to\na deep \"global-to-local\" notion in quantum mechanics: whether we can constrain\nlong-range entanglement using local checks. Given the inability of\nlattice-based quantum LDPC codes to achieve linear distance, research has\nrecently shifted to the other extreme end of topologies, so called\nhigh-dimensional expanders. In this work we show that trying to leverage the\nmere \"random-like\" property of these expanders to find good quantum codes may\nbe futile: quantum CSS codes of $n$ quits built from $d$-complexes that are\n$\\varepsilon$-far from perfectly random, in a well-known sense called\ndiscrepancy, have a small minimal distance. Quantum codes aside, our work\nplaces a first upper-bound on the systole of high-dimensional expanders with\nsmall discrepancy, and a lower-bound on the discrepancy of skeletons of\nRamanujan complexes due to Lubotzky.\n", "  A search for heavy resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a vector boson is\npresented. The analysis is performed using data samples collected in 2015 by\nthe CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.2-2.5 inverse\nfemtobarns. The search is performed in channels in which the vector boson\ndecays into leptonic final states (Z to nu nu, W to l nu, and Z to l l, with l\n= e, mu), while the Higgs boson decays to collimated b quark pairs detected as\na single massive jet. The discriminating power of a jet mass requirement and a\nb jet tagging algorithm are exploited to suppress the standard model\nbackgrounds. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the\nbackground expectation. In the context of a theoretical model with a heavy\nvector triplet, a resonance with mass less than 2 TeV is excluded at 95%\nconfidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of limits on the\nparameters of the model, improving on the reach of previous searches.\n", "  We discuss a supersymmetric generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.\nThese are quantum mechanical models involving $N$ Majorana fermions. The\nsupercharge is given by a polynomial expression in terms of the Majorana\nfermions with random coefficients. The Hamiltonian is the square of the\nsupercharge. The ${\\cal N}=1$ model with a single supercharge has unbroken\nsupersymmetry at large $N$, but non-perturbatively spontaneously broken\nsupersymmetry in the exact theory. We analyze the model by looking at the large\n$N$ equation, and also by performing numerical computations for small values of\n$N$. We also compute the large $N$ spectrum of \"singlet\" operators, where we\nfind a structure qualitatively similar to the ordinary SYK model. We also\ndiscuss an ${\\cal N}=2$ version. In this case, the model preserves\nsupersymmetry in the exact theory and we can compute a suitably weighted Witten\nindex to count the number of ground states, which agrees with the large $N$\ncomputation of the entropy. In both cases, we discuss the supersymmetric\ngeneralizations of the Schwarzian action which give the dominant effects at low\nenergies.\n", "  We generalize the recently developed inchworm quantum Monte Carlo method to\nthe full Keldysh contour with forward, backward, and equilibrium branches to\ndescribe the dynamics of strongly correlated impurity problems with time\ndependent parameters. We introduce a method to compute Green's functions,\nspectral functions, and currents for inchworm Monte Carlo and show how\nsystematic error assessments in real time can be obtained. We then illustrate\nthe capabilities of the algorithm with a study of the behavior of quantum\nimpurities after an instantaneous voltage quench from a thermal equilibrium\nstate.\n", "  We analyze the cosmology of a general Scalar-Tensor theory which encompasses\ngeneralized Brans-Dicke theory, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, non-minimal derivative\ngravity, generalized Galileon gravity and also the general k-essence type\nmodels. Instead of taking into account phenomenological considerations we adopt\na Noether symmetry approach, as a physical criterion, to single out the form of\nundetermined functions in the action. These specified functions symmetrize\nequations of motion in the simplest possible form which result in exact\nsolutions. Demanding de Sitter, power-law and bouncing universe solutions in\nthe absence and presence of matter density leads to exploring new as well as\nwell-investigated models. We show that there are models for which dynamics of\nthe system allow transition from a decelerating phase (matter dominated era) to\nan accelerating phase (dark energy epoch) and could also lead to general\nBrans-Dicke with string correction without a self-interaction potential.\nFurthermore, we classify the models based on phantom or quintessence dark\nenergy point of view. Finally, we obtain the condition for stability of a de\nSitter solution for which the solution is an attractor of the system.\n", "  A comparative analysis of three different time-independent approaches to\nstudying open quantum structures in uniform electric field $\\mathscr{E}$ was\nperformed using the example of one-dimensional attractive or repulsive\n$\\delta$-potential and surface that supports the Robin boundary condition. The\nthree considered methods exploit different properties of the scattering matrix\n$S(\\mathscr{E};E)$ as a function of energy $E$: its poles, real values, and\nzeros of the second derivative of its phase. The essential feature of the\nmethod of zeroing the resolvent, which produces complex energies, is the\nunlimited growth of the wave function at infinity, which is, however,\neliminated by the time-dependent interpretation. The real energies at which the\nunitary scattering matrix becomes real correspond to the largest possible\ndistortion, $S=+1$, or its absence at $S=-1$ which in either case leads to the\nformation of quasibound states. Depending on their response to increasing\nelectric intensity, two types of field-induced positive energy quasibound\nlevels are identified: electron- and hole-like states. Their evolution and\ninteraction in enlarging field lead ultimately to the coalescence of pairs of\nopposite states, with concomitant divergence of the associated dipole moments\nin what is construed as an electric breakdown of the structure. The\ncharacteristic features of the coalescence fields and energies are calculated\nand the behavior of the levels in their vicinity is analyzed. Similarities\nbetween the different approaches and their peculiarities are highlighted; in\nparticular, for zero-field bound state in limit of vanishing $\\mathscr{E}$, all\nthree methods produce same results, with their outcomes deviating from each\nother according to growing electric intensity.\n", "  A new solution of a unitary moving mirror is found to produce finite energy\nand emit thermal radiation despite the absence of an acceleration horizon. In\nthe limit that the mirror approaches the speed of light, the model corresponds\nto a black hole formed from the collapse of a null shell. For speeds less than\nlight, the black hole correspondence, if it exists, is that of a remnant.\n", "  The effect of thermal annealing on wurtzite ZnO, terminated by two surfaces,\n(0 0 0 $\\bar 1$) (which is oxygen-terminated) and (0 0 0 1) (which is\nZn-terminated), is investigated via molecular dynamics simulation using\nreactive force field (ReaxFF). As a result of annealing at a threshold\ntemperature range of 700~K $ < T_{\\mbox{\\small t}} \\leq 800$~K, surface oxygen\natoms begin to sublimate from the (0 0 0 $\\bar 1$) surface, while no atom\nleaves the (0 0 0 1) surface. The ratio of oxygen leaving the surface increases\nwith temperature $T$ (for $T \\geq T_{\\mbox{\\small t}}$). The relative\nluminescence intensity of the secondary peak in the photoluminescence (PL)\nspectra, interpreted as a measurement of amount of vacancies on the sample\nsurfaces, qualitatively agrees with the threshold behavior as found in the MD\nsimulations. Our simulations have also revealed the formation of oxygen dimers\non the surface and evolution of partial charge distribution during the\nannealing process. Our MD simulation based on the ReaxFF is consistent with\nexperimental observations.\n", "  Quadratic algebras are generalizations of Lie algebras which include the\nsymmetry algebras of 2nd order superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions as\nspecial cases. The superintegrable systems are exactly solvable physical\nsystems in classical and quantum mechanics. Distinct superintegrable systems\nand their quadratic algebras can be related by geometric contractions, induced\nby B\\^ocher contractions of the conformal Lie algebra\n${\\mathfrak{so}}(4,\\mathbb {C})$ to itself. In this paper we give a precise\ndefinition of B\\^ocher contractions and show how they can be classified. They\nsubsume well known contractions of ${\\mathfrak{e}}(2,\\mathbb {C})$ and\n${\\mathfrak{so}}(3,\\mathbb {C})$ and have important physical and geometric\nmeanings, such as the derivation of the Askey scheme for obtaining all\nhypergeometric orthogonal polynomials as limits of Racah/Wilson polynomials. We\nalso classify abstract nondegenerate quadratic algebras in terms of an\ninvariant that we call a canonical form. We describe an algorithm for finding\nthe canonical form of such algebras. We calculate explicitly all canonical\nforms arising from quadratic algebras of 2D nondegenerate superintegrable\nsystems on constant curvature spaces and Darboux spaces. We further discuss\ncontraction of quadratic algebras, focusing on those coming from\nsuperintegrable systems.\n", "  We introduce a solvable system of equations that describes non-extremal\nmulticenter solutions to six-dimensional ungauged supergravity coupled to\ntensor multiplets. The system involves a set of functions on a\nthree-dimensional base metric. We obtain a family of non-extremal axisymmetric\nsolutions that generalize the known multicenter extremal solutions, using a\nparticular base metric that introduces a bolt. We analyze the conditions for\nregularity, and in doing so we show that this family does not include solutions\nthat contain an extremal black hole and a smooth bolt. We determine the\nconstraints that are necessary to obtain smooth horizonless solutions involving\na bolt and an arbitrary number of Gibbons-Hawking centers.\n", "  Below the melting temperature $T_m$ crystals are the stable phase of typical\nelemental or molecular systems. However, cooling down a liquid below $T_m$,\ncrystallization is anything but inevitable. The liquid can be supercooled,\neventually forming a glass below the glass transition temperature $T_g$.\nDespite their long lifetimes and the presence of strong barriers that produces\nan apparent stability, supercooled liquids and glasses remain intrinsically\nmetastable state and thermodynamically unstable towards the crystal. Here we\ninvestigated the isothermal crystallization kinetics of the prototypical strong\nglassformer GeO$_2$ in the deep supercooled liquid at 1100 K, about half-way\nbetween $T_m$ and $T_g$. The crystallization process has been observed through\ntime-resolved neutron diffraction for about three days. Data show a continuous\nreorganization of the amorphous structure towards the alpha-quartz phase with\nthe final material composed by crystalline domains plunged into a low-density,\nresidual amorphous matrix. A quantitative analysis of the diffraction patterns\nallows determining the time evolution of the relative fractions of crystal and\namorphous, that was interpreted through an empirical model for the\ncrystallization kinetics. This approach provides a very good description of the\nexperimental data and identifies a predator-prey-like mechanism between crystal\nand amorphous, where the density variation acts as blocking barrier.\n", "  By using the theoretical approaches describing well the available data on\n$t$-integrated coherent photoproduction of light and heavy vector mesons in\nPb-Pb ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in\nRun 1, we calculate the momentum transfer distributions for this process for\n$\\rho$ and $J/\\psi$ vector mesons in the kinematics of Run 2 at the LHC. We\ndemonstrate that nuclear shadowing not only suppresses the absolute value of\nthe cross sections, but also shifts the momentum transfer distributions toward\nsmaller values of the momentum transfer $|t|$. This result can be interpreted\nas a broadening in the impact parameter space of the effective nucleon density\nin nuclei by 14\\% in the case of $\\rho$ and the nuclear gluon distribution by\n$5-11$\\% in the case of $J/\\psi$.\n", "  One of the intriguing characteristics of honeycomb lattices is the appearance\nof a pseudo-magnetic field as a result of mechanical deformation. In the case\nof graphene, the Landau quantization resulting from this pseudo-magnetic field\nhas been measured using scanning tunneling microscopy. Here we show that a\nsignature of the pseudo-magnetic field is a local sublattice symmetry breaking\nobservable as a redistribution of the local density of states. This can be\ninterpreted as a polarization of graphene's pseudospin due to a strain induced\npseudo-magnetic field, in analogy to the alignment of a real spin in a magnetic\nfield. We reveal this sublattice symmetry breaking by tunably straining\ngraphene using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip locally\nlifts the graphene membrane from a SiO$_2$ support, as visible by an increased\nslope of the $I(z)$ curves. The amount of lifting is consistent with molecular\ndynamics calculations, which reveal a deformed graphene area under the tip in\nthe shape of a Gaussian. The pseudo-magnetic field induced by the deformation\nbecomes visible as a sublattice symmetry breaking which scales with the lifting\nheight of the strained deformation and therefore with the pseudo-magnetic field\nstrength. Its magnitude is quantitatively reproduced by analytic and\ntight-binding models, revealing fields of 1000 T. These results might be the\nstarting point for an effective THz valley filter, as a basic element of\nvalleytronics.\n", "  We examine a recent proposal to show the presence of nonlocal Pancharatnam\ntype geometric phases in a quantum mechanical treatment of intensity\ninterferometry measurements upon inclusion of polarizing elements in the setup.\nIt is shown that a completely classical statistical treatment of such effects\nis adequate for practical purposes. Further we show that the phase angles that\nappear in the correlations, while at first sight appearing to resemble\nPancharatnam phases in their mathematical structure, cannot actually be\ninterpreted in that manner. We also describe a simpler Mach-Zehnder type setup\nwhere similar effects can be observed without use of the paraxial\napproximation.\n", "  The term analytic continuation emerges in many branches of Mathematics,\nPhysics, and, more generally, applied Science. Generally speaking, in many\nsituations, given some amount of information that could arise from experimental\nor numerical measurements, one is interested in extending the domain of such\ninformation, to infer the values of some variables which are central for the\nstudy of a given problem. For example, focusing on Condensed Matter Physics,\nstate-of-the-art methodologies to study strongly correlated quantum physical\nsystems are able to yield accurate estimations of dynamical correlations in\nimaginary time. Those functions have to be extended to the whole complex plane,\nvia analytic continuation, in order to infer real-time properties of those\nphysical systems. In this Review, we will present the Genetic Inversion via\nFalsification of Theories method, which allowed us to compute dynamical\nproperties of strongly interacting quantum many--body systems with very high\naccuracy. Even though the method arose in the realm of Condensed Matter\nPhysics, it provides a very general framework to face analytic continuation\nproblems that could emerge in several areas of applied Science. Here we provide\na pedagogical review that elucidates the approach we have developed.\n", "  The synthesis of transition metal heterostructures is currently one of the\nmost vivid fields in the design of novel functional materials. In this paper we\npropose a simple scheme to predict \\emph{band alignment }and \\emph{charge\ntransfer} in complex oxide interfaces. For semiconductor heterostructures band\nalignment rules like the well known Anderson or Schottky-Mott rule are based on\ncomparison of the work function or electron affinity of the bulk components.\nThis scheme breaks down for oxides due to the invalidity of a single\nworkfunction approximation as recently shown (Phys. Rev. B 93, 235116; Adv.\nFunct. Mater. 26, 5471). Here we propose a new scheme which is built on a\ncontinuity condition of valence states originating in the compounds' shared\nnetwork of oxygen. It allows for the prediction of sign and relative amplitude\nof the intrinsic charge transfer, taking as input only information about the\nbulk properties of the components. We support our claims by numerical density\nfunctional theory simulations as well as (where available) experimental\nevidence. Specific applications include i) controlled doping of SrTiO$_3$\nlayers with the use of 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metal oxides and ii) the\ncontrol of magnetic ordering in manganites through tuned charge transfer.\n", "  We report a high-precision numerical estimation of the critical exponent\n$\\alpha$ of the specific heat of the random-field Ising model in four\ndimensions. Our result $\\alpha = 0.12(1)$ indicates a diverging specific-heat\nbehavior and is consistent with the estimation coming from the modified\nhyperscaling relation using our estimate of $\\theta$ via the anomalous\ndimensions $\\eta$ and $\\bar{\\eta}$. Our analysis benefited form a\nhigh-statistics zero-temperature numerical simulation of the model for two\ndistributions of the random fields, namely a Gaussian and Poissonian\ndistribution, as well as recent advances in finite-size scaling and reweighting\nmethods for disordered systems. An original estimate of the critical slowing\ndown exponent $z$ of the maximum-flow algorithm used is also provided.\n", "  Martingale concentration inequalities constitute a powerful mathematical tool\nin the analysis of problems in a wide variety of fields ranging from\nprobability and statistics to information theory and machine learning. Here we\napply techniques borrowed from this field to quantum hypothesis testing, which\nis the problem of discriminating quantum states belonging to two different\nsequences $\\{\\rho_n\\}_{n}$ and $\\{\\sigma_n\\}_n$. We obtain upper bounds on the\nfinite blocklength type II Stein- and Hoeffding errors, which, for i.i.d.\nstates, are in general tighter than the corresponding bounds obtained by\nAudenaert, Mosonyi and Verstraete [Journal of Mathematical Physics, 53(12),\n2012]. We also derive finite blocklength bounds and moderate deviation results\nfor pairs of sequences of correlated states satisfying a (non-homogeneous)\nfactorization property. Examples of such sequences include Gibbs states of spin\nchains with translation-invariant finite range interaction, as well as finitely\ncorrelated quantum states. We apply our results to find bounds on the capacity\nof a certain class of classical-quantum channels with memory, which satisfy a\nso-called channel factorization property- both in the finite blocklength and\nmoderate deviation regimes.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate non-trivial topological effects for a probe\nfield in a Raman medium undergoing molecular modulation processes. The medium\nis driven by two non-collinear pump beams. We show that the angle between the\npumps is related to an effective gauge potential and an effective magnetic\nfield for the probe field in the synthetic space consisting of a synthetic\nfrequency dimension and a spatial dimension. As a result of such effective\nmagnetic field, the probe field can exhibit topologically-protected one-way\nedge state in the synthetic space, as well as Landau levels which manifests as\nsuppression of both diffraction and sideband generation. Our work identifies a\npreviously unexplored route towards creating topological photonics effects, and\nhighlights an important connection between topological photonics and nonlinear\noptics.\n", "  In strong magnetic fields, massless electrons in graphene populate\nrelativistic Landau levels with the square-root dependence of each level energy\non its number and magnetic field. Interaction-induced deviations from this\nsingle-particle picture were observed in recent experiments on cyclotron\nresonance and magneto-Raman scattering. Previous attempts to calculate such\ndeviations theoretically using the unscreened Coulomb interaction resulted in\noverestimated many-body effects. This work presents many-body calculations of\ncyclotron and magneto-Raman transitions in single-layer graphene in the\npresence of Coulomb interaction, which is statically screened in the\nrandom-phase approximation. We take into account self-energy and excitonic\neffects as well as Landau level mixing, and achieve good agreement of our\nresults with the experimental data for graphene on different substrates.\nImportant role of a self-consistent treatment of the screening is found.\n", "  The NA62 experiment collected a large sample of charged kaon decays in 2007\nwith a highly efficient trigger for decays into electrons. A measurement of the\n$\\pi^0$ electromagnetic transition form factor slope parameter from\n$1.11\\times10^{6}$ fully reconstructed $K^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\pi^0_D, \\pi^0_D \\to\ne^+ e^-\\gamma$ events is reported. The measured value $a = (3.68 \\pm\n0.57)\\times10^{-2}$ is in good agreement with theoretical expectations and\nprevious measurements, and represents the most precise experimental\ndetermination of the slope in the time-like momentum transfer region.\n", "  We define a kind of heat engine via three-dimensional charged BTZ black\nholes. This case is quite subtle and needs to be more careful. The heat flow\nalong the isochores does not equal to zero since the specific heat $C_V\\neq0$\nand this point completely differs from the cases discussed before whose\nisochores and adiabats are identical. So one cannot simply apply the paradigm\nin the former literatures. However, if one introduces a new thermodynamic\nparameter associated with the renormalization length scale, the above problem\ncan be solved. We obtain the analytical efficiency expression of the\nthree-dimensional charged BTZ black hole heat engine for two different schemes.\nMoreover, we double check with the exact formula. Our result presents the first\nspecific example for the sound correctness of the exact efficiency formula. We\nargue that the three-dimensional charged BTZ black hole can be viewed as a toy\nmodel for further investigation of holographic heat engine. Furthermore, we\ncompare our result with that of the Carnot cycle and extend the former result\nto three-dimensional spacetime. In this sense, the result in this paper would\nbe complementary to those obtained in four-dimensional spacetime or ever\nhigher. Last but not the least, the heat engine efficiency discussed in this\npaper may serve as a criterion to discriminate the two thermodynamic approaches\nintroduced in Ref.[29] and our result seems to support the approach which\nintroduces a new thermodynamic parameter $R=r_0$.\n", "  The ground state of quantum chromodynamics in sufficiently strong external\nmagnetic fields and at moderate baryon chemical potential is a chiral soliton\nlattice (CSL) of neutral pions. We investigate the interplay between the CSL\nstructure and dynamical electromagnetic fields. Our main result is that in\npresence of the CSL background, the two physical photon polarizations and the\nneutral pion mix, giving rise to two gapped excitations and one gapless mode\nwith a nonrelativistic dispersion relation. The nature of this mode depends on\nthe direction of its propagation, interpolating between a circularly polarized\nelectromagnetic wave and a neutral pion surface wave, which in turn arises from\nthe spontaneously broken translation invariance. Quite remarkably, there is a\nneutral-pion-like mode that remains gapped even in the chiral limit, in seeming\ncontradiction to the Goldstone theorem. Finally, we have a first look at the\neffect of thermal fluctuations of the CSL, showing that even the soft\nnonrelativistic excitation does not lead to the Landau-Peierls instability.\nHowever, it leads to an anomalous contribution to pressure that scales with\ntemperature and magnetic field as $T^{5/2}(B/f_\\pi)^{3/2}$.\n", "  First principle gyrokinetic simulation of the edge turbulent transport in\ntoroidal plasmas finds a reverse trend in the turbulent transport coefficients\nunder strong gradients. It is found that there exist both linear and nonlinear\ncritical gradients for the nonmonotonicity of transport characteristics. The\ndiscontinuity of transport flux slope around the turning gradient shows\nfeatures of second order phase transition. Under strong gradient the most\nunstable modes are in non-ground eigenstates with unconventional mode\nstructures, which significantly reduces the effective correlation length and\nthus reverse the transport trend. Our results suggest a completely new\nmechanism for the low to high confinement mode transition without invoking\nshear flow or zonal flow.\n", "  We present the results of 3D-hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flow in\nthe eclipsing dwarf nova V1239 Her in quiescence. The model includes the\noptical star filling its Roche lobe, a gas stream emanating from the inner\nLagrangian point of the binary system, and the accretion disc structure. A cold\nhydrogen gas stream is initially emitted towards a point-like gravitational\ncentre. A stationary accretion disc is formed in about 15 orbital periods after\nthe beginning of accretion. The model takes into account partial ionization of\nhydrogen and uses realistic cooling function for hydrogen. The light curve of\nthe system is calculated as the volume emission of optically thin layers along\nthe line of sight up to the optical depth \\tau =2/3 calculated using\nPlanck-averaged opacities. The calculated eclipse light curves show good\nagreement with observations, with the changing shape of pre-eclipse and\npost-eclipse light curves being explained entirely due to ~ 50% variations in\nthe mass accretion rate through the gas stream.\n", "  The spin-dependent electron transmission through a helical membrane with\naccount of linear spin-orbit interaction has been investigated by numerically\nsolving the Schr\\\"odinger equation in cylindrical coordinates . It is shown\nthat the spin precession is affected by the magnitude of geometric parameters\nand chirality of the membrane. This effect is also explained analytically by\nusing the perturbation theory in the weak coupling regime. In the strong\ncoupling regime, the current spin polarization is evident when the number of\nthe open modes in leads is larger than that of the open channels in the\nmembrane. Moreover, we find that the chirality of the helical membrane can\ndetermine the orientation of current spin polarization. Therefore, one may get\ntotally opposite spin currents from the helical membranes rolled against\ndifferent directions.\n", "  This review discusses both experimental and theoretical aspects of searches\nfor dark matter at the LHC. An overview of the various experimental search\nchannels is given, followed by a summary of the different theoretical\napproaches for predicting dark matter signals. A special emphasis is placed on\nthe interplay between LHC dark matter searches and other kinds of dark matter\nexperiments, as well as among different types of LHC searches.\n", "  Optical frequency combs (OFC) provide a convenient reference for the\nfrequency stabilization of continuous-wave lasers. We demonstrate a frequency\ncontrol method relying on tracking over a wide range and stabilizing the beat\nnote between the laser and the OFC. The approach combines fast frequency ramps\non a millisecond timescale in the entire mode-hop free tuning range of the\nlaser and precise stabilization to single frequencies. We apply it to a\ncommercially available optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and demonstrate\ntuning over more than 60 GHz with a ramping speed up to 3 GHz/ms. Frequency\nramps spanning 15 GHz are performed in less than 10 ms, with the OPO instantly\nrelocked to the OFC after the ramp at any desired frequency. The developed\ncontrol hardware and software is able to stabilize the OPO to sub-MHz precision\nand to perform sequences of fast frequency ramps automatically.\n", "  There possibly exists some direct, non-gravitational coupling between dark\nenergy and dark matter. This possibility should be seriously tested by using\nobservations, which requires us to understand such a scenario from the aspects\nof both expansion history and growth of structure. It is found that once\ncalculating the perturbations in the interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario,\nfor most cases the curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales is divergent,\nwhich is a catastrophe for the IDE cosmology. We found a solution to this\nissue, which is to establish an effective theory to treat the dark energy\nperturbations totally based on the basic facts of dark energy. This scheme\ngeneralizes the parametrized post-Friedmann framework of uncoupled dark energy\nand can be used to cure the instability of the IDE cosmology. The whole\nparameter space of IDE models can henceforward be explored by observational\ndata. The IDE scenario can thus be tested or falsified with current and future\nobservational data by using the PPF approach. We expect that the future highly\naccurate observational data would offer the certain answer to the question\nwhether there is a direct coupling between dark energy and dark matter.\n", "  We report the detection of extended Halpha emission from the tip of the HI\ndisk of the nearby edge-on galaxy UGC 7321, observed with the Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope. The\nHalpha surface brightness fades rapidly where the HI column density drops below\nN(HI) = 10^19 cm^-2 , consistent with fluorescence arising at the ionisation\nfront from gas that is photoionized by the extragalactic ultraviolet background\n(UVB). The surface brightness measured at this location is (1.2 +/- 0.5)x10^-19\nerg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2, where the error is mostly systematic and results from the\nproximity of the signal to the edge of the MUSE field of view, and from the\npresence of a sky line next to the redshifted Halpha wavelength. By combining\nthe Halpha and the HI 21 cm maps with a radiative transfer calculation of an\nexponential disk illuminated by the UVB, we derive a value for the HI\nphotoionization rate of Gamma ~ (6-8)x10^-14 1/s . This value is consistent\nwith transmission statistics of the Lyalpha forest and with recent models of a\nUVB which is dominated by quasars.\n", "  Prompt photon production is known as a powerful tool for testing perturbative\nQCD predictions and also the validity of parton densities in the nucleon and\nnuclei especially of the gluon. In this work, we have performed a detailed\nstudy on this subject focusing on the isolated prompt photon production in $ p\n$-Pb collisions at forward rapidity at the LHC. The impact of input nuclear\nmodifications obtained from different global analyses by various groups on\nseveral quantities has been investigated to estimate the order of magnitude of\nthe difference between their predictions. We have also studied in detail the\ntheoretical uncertainties in the results due to various sources. We found that\nthere is a remarkable difference between the predictions from the nCTEQ15 and\nother groups in all ranges of photon transverse momentum $ p_\\textrm{T}^\\gamma\n$. Their differences become more explicit in the calculation of the nuclear\nmodification ratio and also the yield asymmetry between the forward and\nbackward rapidities rather than single differential cross sections. We\nemphasize that future measurements with ALICE will be very useful not only for\ndecreasing the uncertainty of the gluon nuclear modification, but also to\naccurately determine its central values, especially in the shadowing region.\n", "  We propose a one-dimensional model for collecting lymphatics coupled with a\nnovel Electro-Fluid-Mechanical Contraction (EFMC) model for dynamical\ncontractions, based on a modified FitzHugh-Nagumo model for action potentials.\nThe one-dimensional model for a compliant lymphatic vessel is a set of\nhyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The EFMC model combines the\nelectrical activity of lymphangions (action potentials) with fluid-mechanical\nfeedback (stretch of the lymphatic wall and wall shear stress) and the\nmechanical variation of the lymphatic wall properties (contractions). The EFMC\nmodel is governed by four Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and\nphenomenologically relies on: (1) environmental calcium influx, (2)\nstretch-activated calcium influx, and (3) contraction inhibitions induced by\nwall shear stresses. We carried out a complete mathematical analysis of the\nstability of the stationary state of the EFMC model. Overall, the EFMC model\nallows imitating the influence of pressure and wall shear stress on the\nfrequency of contractions observed experimentally. Lymphatic valves are\nmodelled using a well-established lumped-parameter model which allows\nsimulating stenotic and regurgitant valves. We analysed several lymphodynamical\nindexes of a single lymphangion for a wide range of upstream and downstream\npressure combinations. Stenotic and regurgitant valves were modelled, and their\neffects are here quantified. Results for stenotic valves showed in the\ndownstream lymphangion that for low frequencies of contractions the Calculated\nPump Flow (CPF) index remained almost unaltered, while for high frequencies the\nCPF dramatically decreased depending on the severity of the stenosis (up to 93%\nfor a severe stenosis). Results for incompetent valves showed that the net flow\nduring a lymphatic cycle tends to zero as the degree of incompetence increases.\n", "  We analyse the renormalization of the of two-nucleon interaction with\nmultiple subtractions in peripheral waves considering two chiral forces at\nN3LO. Phase shifts at low energies are then computed with several subtraction\npoints below \\mu = 10 / fm. We show that for most peripheral waves the phase\nshifts have nearly no dependence on the renormalization scale. In two cases the\nphase shifts converge slowly as the renormalization scale approaches \\mu = 1 /\nfm and in one case the phase shifts presented oscillations with respect to the\nsubtraction point \\mu.\n", "  We say that a formal power series $\\sum a_n z^n$ with rational coefficients\nis a 2-function if the numerator of the fraction $a_{n/p}-p^2 a_n$ is divisible\nby $p^2$ for every prime number $p$. One can prove that 2-functions with\nrational coefficients appear as building block of BPS generating functions in\ntopological string theory. Using the Frobenius map we define 2-functions with\ncoefficients in algebraic number fields. We establish two results pertaining to\nthese functions. First, we show that the class of 2-functions is closed under\nthe so-called framing operation (related to compositional inverse of power\nseries). Second, we show that 2-functions arise naturally in geometry as\n$q$-expansion of the truncated normal function associated with an algebraic\ncycle extending a degenerating family of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.\n", "  Group discussions are a way for individuals to exchange ideas and arguments\nin order to reach better decisions than they could on their own. One of the\npremises of productive discussions is that better solutions will prevail, and\nthat the idea selection process is mediated by the (relative) competence of the\nindividuals involved. However, since people may not know their actual\ncompetence on a new task, their behavior is influenced by their self-estimated\ncompetence --- that is, their confidence --- which can be misaligned with their\nactual competence.\n  Our goal in this work is to understand the effects of confidence-competence\nmisalignment on the dynamics and outcomes of discussions. To this end, we\ndesign a large-scale natural setting, in the form of an online team-based\ngeography game, that allows us to disentangle confidence from competence and\nthus separate their effects.\n  We find that in task-oriented discussions, the more-confident individuals\nhave a larger impact on the group's decisions even when these individuals are\nat the same level of competence as their teammates. Furthermore, this\nunjustified role of confidence in the decision-making process often leads teams\nto under-perform. We explore this phenomenon by investigating the effects of\nconfidence on conversational dynamics.\n", "  In this note, we propose an extension of the Wasserstein 1-metric ($W_1$) for\nmatrix probability densities, matrix-valued density measures, and an unbalanced\ninterpretation of mass transport. The key is using duality theory, in\nparticular, a \"dual of the dual\" formulation of $W_1$. This matrix analogue of\nthe Earth Mover's Distance has several attractive features including ease of\ncomputation.\n", "  Earthquakes cannot be predicted with precision, but algorithms exist for\nintermediate-term middle range prediction of main shocks above a pre-assigned\nthreshold, based on seismicity patterns. Few years ago, a first attempt was\nmade in the framework of project SISMA, funded by Italian Space Agency, to\njointly use seismological tools, like CN algorithm and scenario earthquakes,\nand geodetic methods and techniques, like GPS and SAR monitoring, in order to\neffectively constrain priority areas where to concentrate prevention and\nseismic risk mitigation. We present a further development of integration of\nseismological and geodetic information, clearly showing the contribution of\ngeodesy to the understanding and prediction of earthquakes. As a relevant\napplication, the seismic crisis that started in Central Italy in August 2016 is\nconsidered in a retrospective analysis. Differently from the much more common\napproach, here GPS data are not used to estimate the standard 2D velocity and\nstrain field in the area, but to reconstruct the velocity and strain pattern\nalong transects, which are properly oriented according to the a priori\ninformation about the known tectonic setting. Overall, the analysis of the\navailable geodetic data indicates that it is possible to highlight the velocity\nvariation and the related strain accumulation in the area of Amatrice event,\nwithin the area alarmed by CN since November 1st, 2012. The considered counter\nexamples, across CN alarmed and not-alarmed areas, do not show any comparable\nspatial acceleration localized trend. Therefore, we show that the combined\nanalysis of the results of CN prediction algorithms, with those from the\nprocessing of adequately dense and permanent GNSS network data, may allow the\nroutine highlight in advance of the strain accumulation. Thus it is possible to\nsignificantly reduce the size of the CN alarmed areas.\n", "  The present CORE 3.1 (COmpendium of RElations, Version 3.1) contains various\nformulas and relations used in the practical calculations in the Standard\nModel. The properties of the Pauli, Dirac, Gell--Mann matrices, wave functions\nof free fermions and gauge bosons are considered. We present the full\nLagrangian of the Standard Model and the corresponding Feynman rules. The\nmethod of the evaluation of the Feynman (loop) integrals and calculations in\nnon-covariant gauges is considered. We discuss in brief the relativistic\nkinematic and present a large number of the matrix elements of the various\nprocesses in the Standard Model.\n", "  The beginning of the calendar record inscribed on the Mamari tablet has been\ndated to the day of the summer solstice of December 20, 1680 A.D. The moon was\nnot visible earlier at night. Because of a possible solar eclipse it was a\nperilous day, a precursor of the future misfortunes: the motion of Halley's\nComet of 1682 A.D. and the rebellion of the western tribes. The new data about\nthe watchings of the star Antares have been obtained, too.\n", "  Entangled photon pairs-discrete light quanta that exhibit non-classical\ncorrelations-play a central role in quantum information and quantum\ncommunication technologies. It is a natural demand from technological\napplications on the intensity of the entangled photon pairs, such that\nsufficient signal strength can be achieved. Here we propose approaches based on\nklystron tubes that could potentially achieve stable amplification of the\nentangled photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion\n(SPDC) and entanglement transfer.\n", "  The aurorae of Uranus were recently detected in the far ultraviolet with the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) providing a new, so far unique, means to remotely\nstudy the asymmetric Uranian magnetosphere from Earth. We analyze here two new\nHST Uranus campaigns executed in Sept. 2012 and Nov. 2014 with different\ntemporal coverage and under variable solar wind conditions numerically\npredicted by three different MHD codes. Overall, HST images taken with the\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph reveal auroral emissions in three pairs of\nsuccessive images (one pair acquired in 2012 and two in 2014), hence six\nadditional auroral detections in total, including the most intense Uranian\naurorae ever seen with HST. The detected emissions occur close the expected\narrival of interplanetary shocks. They appear as extended spots at southern\nlatitudes, rotating with the planet. They radiate 5-24 kR and 1.3-8.8 GW of\nultraviolet emission from H$_2$, last for tens of minutes and vary on\ntimescales down to a few seconds. Fitting the 2014 observations with model\nauroral ovals constrains the longitude of the southern (northern) magnetic pole\nto 104+\\-26{\\deg} (284-\\-26{\\deg}) in the Uranian Longitude System. We suggest\nthat the Uranian near-equinoctial aurorae are pulsed cusp emissions possibly\ntriggered by large-scale magnetospheric compressions.\n", "  The aim of this communication is to correct inaccurate statements presented\nin a Commentary on the paper titled: \"Radiation forces and torque on a rigid\nelliptical cylinder in acoustical plane progressive and (quasi)standing waves\nwith arbitrary incidence\" [Phys. Fluids 28, 077104 (2016)].\n", "  A combination of a priority queueing model and mean field theory shows the\nemergence of traders' swarm behavior, even when each has a subjective\nprediction of the market driven by a limit order book. Using a nonlinear Markov\nmodel, we analyze the dynamics of traders who select a favorable order price\ntaking into account the waiting cost incurred by others. We find swarm behavior\nemerges because of the delay in trader reactions to the market, and the\ndirection of the swarm is decided by the current market position and the\nintensity of zero-intelligent random behavior, rather than subjective trader\npredictions.\n", "  A technique to derive the propagation characteristics and field distributions\nof waves guided by scalar and tensorial reactance surfaces modulated by\nperiodic or discrete Fourier spectrum functions in the propagation direction is\npresented. The method, based on an equivalent lumped circuits approach, can be\nseen as a generalization of the Oliner method for the TM propagation on scalar\nsinusoidally modulated reactance surfaces. Numerical results are obtained for\nboth surface wave and leaky wave solutions. The relevance of these studies to\nmodulated metasurface antennas is discussed.\n", "  We study MNLS related to the D.III-type symmetric spaces. Applying to them\nMikhailov reduction groups of the type $\\mathbb{Z}_r\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ we\nderive new types of 2-component NLS equations. These are {\\bf not}\ncounterexamples to the Zakharov-Schulman theorem because the corresponding\ninteraction Hamiltonians depend not only on $|q_k|^2$, but also on $q_1q_2^*\n+q_1^* q_2$.\n", "  Three dimensional topological insulators are bulk insulators with\n$\\mathbf{Z}_2$ topological electronic order that gives rise to conducting\nlight-like surface states. These surface electrons are exceptionally resistant\nto localization by non-magnetic disorder, and have been adopted as the basis\nfor a wide range of proposals to achieve new quasiparticle species and device\nfunctionality. Recent studies have yielded a surprise by showing that in spite\nof resisting localization, topological insulator surface electrons can be\nreshaped by defects into distinctive resonance states. Here we use numerical\nsimulations and scanning tunneling microscopy data to show that these resonance\nstates have significance well beyond the localized regime usually associated\nwith impurity bands. At native densities in the model Bi$_2$X$_3$ (X=Bi, Te)\ncompounds, defect resonance states are predicted to generate a new quantum\nbasis for an emergent electron gas that supports diffusive electrical\ntransport.\n", "  The 70-m DSN's Deep Space Station antenna 14 (DSS-14) at Goldstone has\nrecently been outfitted with instrumentation to enable pulsar searching and\ntiming operation. Systems capable of similar operations are undergoing\ninstallation at DSS-63, and are planned for DSS-43. The Goldstone system is the\nfirst of these to become operational, with a 640 MHz bandwidth stretching from\n1325-1965 MHz. Initial results from the pulsar timing pipeline show short-term\nresiduals of < 100 ns for pulsar B1937+21. Commissioning obsefvations at DSS-14\nto obtain a baseline set of TOA measurements on several millisecond pulsars are\ncurrently underway.\n", "  Plasma proteins such as fibrinogen induce the aggregation of red blood cells\n(RBC) into rouleaux, which are responsible for the pronounced shear thinning\nbehavior of blood, control the erythro- cyte sedimentation rate (ESR) a common\nhematological test and are involved in many situations of physiological\nrelevance such as structuration of blood in the microcirculation or clot\nformation in pathological situations. Confocal microscopy is used to\ncharacterize the shape of RBCs within rouleaux at equilibrium as a function of\nmacromolecular concentration, revealing the diversity of contact zone\nmorphology. Three different configurations that have only been partly predicted\nbefore are identified, namely parachute, male-female and sigmoid shapes, and\nquantitatively recovered by numerical simulations. A detailed experimental and\ntheoretical analysis of clusters of two cells shows that the deformation\nincreases nonlinearly with the interaction energy. Models indicate a forward\nbifurcation in which the contacting membrane undergoes a buckling instability\nfrom a flat to a de- formed contact zone at a critical value of the interaction\nenergy. These results are not only relevant for the understanding of the\nmorphology and stability of RBC aggregates, but also for a whole class of\ninteracting soft deformable objects such as vesicles, capsules or cells in\ntissues.\n", "  Industrial development is the process by which economies learn how to produce\nnew products and services. But how do economies learn? And who do they learn\nfrom? The literature on economic geography and economic development has\nemphasized two learning channels: inter-industry learning, which involves\nlearning from related industries; and inter-regional learning, which involves\nlearning from neighboring regions. Here we use 25 years of data describing the\nevolution of China's economy between 1990 and 2015--a period when China\nmultiplied its GDP per capita by a factor of ten--to explore how Chinese\nprovinces diversified their economies. First, we show that the probability that\na province will develop a new industry increases with the number of related\nindustries that are already present in that province, a fact that is suggestive\nof inter-industry learning. Also, we show that the probability that a province\nwill develop an industry increases with the number of neighboring provinces\nthat are developed in that industry, a fact suggestive of inter-regional\nlearning. Moreover, we find that the combination of these two channels exhibit\ndiminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning\nchannels is redundant when the other one is present. Finally, we address\nendogeneity concerns by using the introduction of high-speed rail as an\ninstrument to isolate the effects of inter-regional learning. Our\ndifferences-in-differences (DID) analysis reveals that the introduction of high\nspeed-rail increased the industrial similarity of pairs of provinces connected\nby high-speed rail. Also, industries in provinces that were connected by rail\nincreased their productivity when they were connected by rail to other\nprovinces where that industry was already present. These findings suggest that\ninter-regional and inter-industry learning played a role in China's great\neconomic expansion.\n", "  Oxide interfaces play very important roles for the physical and chemical\nproperties of nanostructured materials, such as an ionic conductivity,\nsuperconductivity, and magnetism. Gadolinia-doped Ceria (GDC) is commonly\nselected as the interlayer between (La,Sr)MnO3 and Y2O3-stabilized ZrO2 in fuel\ncells. The chemical expansions across the oxide interlayer were carefully\nexamined at the atomic resolution in order to understand the cation diffusion\nand existence of oxygen deficiency at the interfaces.\n", "  Spin-polarized field-effect transistor (spin-FET), where a dielectric layer\nis generally employed for the electrical gating as the traditional FET, stands\nout as a seminal spintronic device under the miniaturization trend of\nelectronics. It would be fundamentally transformative if optical gating was\nused for spin-FET. We report a new type of spin-polarized field-effect\ntransistor (spin-FET) with optical gating, which is fabricated by partial\nexposure of the (La,Sr)MnO3 channel to light-emitting diode (LED) light. The\nmanipulation of the channel conductivity is ascribed to the enhanced scattering\nof the spin-polarized current by photon-excited antiparallel aligned spins. And\nthe photon-gated spin-FET shows strong light power dependence and reproducible\nenhancement of resistance under light illumination, indicting well-defined\nconductivity cycling features. Our finding would enrich the concept of spin-FET\nand promote the use of optical means in spintronics for low power consumption\nand ultrafast data processing.\n", "  The purpose of this expository note is to revisit Morawetz's method for\nobtaining a lower bound on the rate of exponential decay of waves for the\nDirichlet problem outside star-shaped obstacles, and to discuss the uniqueness\nof the sphere as the extremizer of the sharp lower bound proved by Ralston.\n", "  This work takes inspiration from chemistry where the spectral characteristics\nof the molecules are determined by hybridization of electronic states evolving\nfrom the individual atomic orbitals. Based on analogy between quantum mechanics\nand the classical electrodynamics, we sorted dielectric microspheres with\nalmost identical positions of their whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances.\nUsing these microspheres as classical photonic atoms, we assembled them in a\nwide range of structures including linear chains and planar photonic molecules.\nWe studied WGM hybridization effects in such structures using side coupling by\ntapered microfibers as well as finite difference time domain modeling. We\ndemonstrated that the patterns of WGM spectral splitting are representative of\nthe symmetry, number of constituting atoms and topology of the photonic\nmolecules which in principle can be viewed as \"spectral signatures\" of various\nmolecules. We also show new ways of controlling WGM coupling constants in such\nmolecules. Excellent agreement was found between measured transmission spectra\nand spectral signatures of photonic molecules predicted by simulation.\n", "  This paper is a continuation of our recent paper devoted to refining the\nparameters of three component (bulge, disk, halo) axisymmetric model Galactic\ngravitational potentials differing by the expression for the dark matter halo\nusing the velocities of distant objects. In all models the bulge and disk\npotentials are described by the Miyamoto-Nagai expressions. In our previous\npaper we used the Allen-Santill'an (I), Wilkinson--Evans (II), and\nNavarro-Frenk-White (III) models to describe the halo. In this paper we use a\nspherical logarithmic Binney potential (model IV), a Plummer sphere (model V),\nand a Hernquist potential (model VI) to describe the halo. A set of present-day\nobservational data in the range of Galactocentric distances R from 0 to 200 kpc\nis used to refine the parameters of the listed models, which are employed most\ncommonly at present. The model rotation curves are fitted to the observed\nvelocities by taking into account the constraints on the local matter density\nand the vertical force . Model VI looks best among the three models considered\nhere from the viewpoint of the achieved accuracy of fitting the model rotation\ncurves to the measurements. This model is close to the Navarro-Frenk-White\nmodel III refined and considered best in our previous paper, which is shown\nusing the integration of the orbits of two globular clusters, Lynga 7 and NGC\n5053, as an example.\n", "  One focus of modern astronomy is to detect temperate terrestrial exoplanets\nwell-suited for atmospheric characterisation. A milestone was recently achieved\nwith the detection of three Earth-sized planets transiting (i.e. passing in\nfront of) a star just 8% the mass of the Sun 12 parsecs away. Indeed, the\ntransiting configuration of these planets with the Jupiter-like size of their\nhost star - named TRAPPIST-1 - makes possible in-depth studies of their\natmospheric properties with current and future astronomical facilities. Here we\nreport the results of an intensive photometric monitoring campaign of that star\nfrom the ground and with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our observations reveal\nthat at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to the Earth revolve\naround TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain such that\ntheir orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.21, 12.35 days) are near\nratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed\nfarther from the star and migrated inward. The seven planets have equilibrium\ntemperatures low enough to make possible liquid water on their surfaces.\n", "  After a general discussion of the thermodynamics of conductive processes, we\nintroduce specific observables enabling the connection of the diffusive\ntransport properties with the microscopic dynamics. We solve the case of\nBrownian particles, both analytically and numerically, and address then whether\naspects of the classic Onsager's picture generalize to the non-local\nnon-reversible dynamics described by logistic map iterates. While in the\nchaotic case numerical evidence of a monotonic relaxation is found, at the\nonset of chaos complex relaxation patterns emerge.\n", "  HD 219134 is a K-dwarf star at a distance of 6.5 parsecs around which several\nlow-mass planets were recently discovered. The Spitzer space telescope detected\na transit of the innermost of these planets, HD 219134 b, whose mass and radius\n(4.5 MEarth and 1.6 REarth respectively) are consistent with a rocky\ncomposition. Here, we report new highprecision time-series photometry of the\nstar acquired with Spitzer revealing that the second innermost planet of the\nsystem, HD 219134 c, is also transiting. A global analysis of the Spitzer\ntransit light curves and the most up-to-date HARPS-N velocity data set yields\nmass and radius estimations of 4.74+-0.19 MEarth and 1.602+-0.055 REarth for HD\n219134 b, and of 4.36+-0.22 MEarth and 1.511+-0.047 REarth for HD 219134 c.\nThese values suggest rocky compositions for both planets. Thanks to the\nproximity and the small size of their host star (0.778+-0.005 Rsun), these two\ntransiting exoplanets - the nearest to the Earth to date - are well-suited for\na detailed characterization (precision of a few percent on mass and radius,\nconstraints on the atmospheric properties...) that could give important\nconstraints on the nature and formation mechanism of the ubiquitous\nshort-period planets of a few Earth masses.\n", "  A new search strategy for the detection of the elusive dark matter (DM) axion\nis proposed. The idea is based on streaming DM axions, whose flux might get\ntemporally enormously enhanced due to gravitational lensing. This can happen if\nthe Sun or some planet (including the Moon) is found along the direction of a\nDM stream propagating towards the Earth location. The experimental requirements\nto the axion haloscope are a wide-band performance combined with a fast axion\nrest mass scanning mode, which are feasible. Once both conditions have been\nimplemented in a haloscope, the axion search can continue parasitically almost\nas before. Interestingly, some new DM axion detectors are operating wide-band\nby default. In order not to miss the actually unpredictable timing of a\npotential short duration signal, a network of co-ordinated axion antennae is\nrequired, preferentially distributed world-wide. The reasoning presented here\nfor the axions applies to some degree also to any other DM candidates like the\nWIMPs.\n", "  A cellular non-linear network (CNN) is a uniform regular array of locally\nconnected continuous-state machines, or nodes, which update their states\nsimultaneously in discrete time. A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is an\nelectro-chemical reactor using the metabolism of bacteria to drive an\nelectrical current. In a CNN model of the MFC, each node takes a vector of\nstates which represent geometrical characteristics of the cell, like the\nelectrodes or impermeable borders, and quantify measurable properties like\nbacterial population, charges produced and hydrogen ions concentrations. The\nmodel allows the study of integral reaction of the MFC, including temporal\noutputs, to spatial disturbances of the bacterial population and supply of\nnutrients. The model can also be used to evaluate inhomogeneous configurations\nof bacterial populations attached on the electrode biofilms.\n", "  In this work we address systems described by time-dependent non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians under time-dependent Dyson maps. We shown that when starting from\na given time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which is not itself an\nobservable, an infinite chain of gauge linked time-dependent non-observable\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians can be derived from it. The matrix elements of the\nobservables associated with all these non observable Hamiltonians are, however,\nall linked to each other, and in the particular case where global gauges exist,\nthese matrix elements becomes all identical to each other. In this case,\ntherefore, by approaching whatever the Hamiltonian in the chain we can get\ninformation about any other Hamiltonian. We then show that the whole chain of\ntime-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonians collapses to a single time-dependent\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian when, under particular choices for the time-dependent\nDyson maps, the observability of the Hamiltonians is assured. This collapse\nthus shows that the observability character of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian\nprevents the construction of the gauge-linked Hamiltonian chain and,\nconsequently, the possibility of approaching one Hamiltonian from another.\n", "  X-ray fluorescence computed tomography based on sheet-beam can save a huge\namount of time to obtain a whole set of projections using synchrotron. However,\nit is clearly unpractical for most biomedical research laboratories. In this\npaper, polychromatic X-ray fluorescence computed tomography with sheet-beam\ngeometry is tested by Monte Carlo simulation. First, two phantoms (A and B)\nfilled with PMMA are used to simulate imaging process through GEANT 4. Phantom\nA contains several GNP-loaded regions with the same size (10 mm) in height and\ndiameter but different Au weight concentration ranging from 0.3% to 1.8%.\nPhantom B contains twelve GNP-loaded regions with the same Au weight\nconcentration (1.6%) but different diameter ranging from 1mm to 9mm. Second,\ndiscretized presentation of imaging model is established to reconstruct more\naccurate XFCT images. Third, XFCT images of phantom A and B are reconstructed\nby fliter backprojection (FBP) and maximum likelihood expectation maximization\n(MLEM) with and without correction, respectively. Contrast to noise ratio (CNR)\nis calculated to evaluate all the reconstructed images. Our results show that\nit is feasible for sheet-beam XFCT system based on polychromatic X-ray source\nand the discretized imaging model can be used to reconstruct more accurate\nimages.\n", "  We present 21 new radio-continuum detections at catalogued planetary nebula\n(PN) positions in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using all presently\navailable data from the Australia Telescope Online Archive at 3, 6, 13 and 20\ncm. Additionally, 11 previously detected LMC radio PNe are re-examined with $ 7\n$ detections confirmed and reported here. An additional three PNe from our\nprevious surveys are also studied. The last of the 11 previous detections is\nnow classified as a compact \\HII\\ region which makes for a total sample of 31\nradio PNe in the LMC. The radio-surface brightness to diameter ($\\Sigma$-D)\nrelation is parametrised as $\\Sigma \\propto {D^{ - \\beta }}$. With the\navailable 6~cm $\\Sigma$-$D$ data we construct $\\Sigma$-$D$ samples from 28 LMC\nPNe and 9 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) radio detected PNe. The results of our\nsampled PNe in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are comparable to previous\nmeasurements of the Galactic PNe. We obtain $\\beta=2.9\\pm0.4$ for the MC PNe\ncompared to $\\beta = 3.1\\pm0.4$ for the Galaxy. For a better insight into\nsample completeness and evolutionary features we reconstruct the $\\Sigma$-$D$\ndata probability density function (PDF). The PDF analysis implies that PNe are\nnot likely to follow linear evolutionary paths. To estimate the significance of\nsensitivity selection effects we perform a Monte Carlo sensitivity simulation\non the $\\Sigma$-$D$ data. The results suggest that selection effects are\nsignificant for values larger than $\\beta \\sim 2.6$ and that a measured slope\nof $\\beta=2.9$ should correspond to a sensitivity-free value of $\\sim 3.4$.\n", "  On the morning of the August 11th 1999, a total eclipse of the sun plunged\nCornwall and parts of Devon into darkness. The event of the eclipse was bound\nto attract a great deal of scientific and media attention. Realizing that the\ndifferences in day-time/night-time propagation of VLF/LF/MF to HF bands would\nalso apply during the darkness of the eclipse, the eclipse offered a rare PR\nopportunity to promote radio to the general public. At the same time the\nspecific nature of the disturbance to the upper atmosphere and the effect on\nradio propagation could be examined in detail using scientific instruments at\nminimum cost since most instruments would not have to be moved. This would\nallow prediction models to be tested in a controlled fashion. Contained within\nthis report are the details and results of the radio and ionospheric\nexperiments conducted by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory during the 1999\ntotal solar eclipse. The promoting of the radio experiments with the general\npublic produced nearly 60 appearances on local and national TV, newspapers and\nperiodicals. Close to 1700 people responded to the general public medium wave\nexperiment and 16 million people looked in on the general eclipse web site\n(part funded by RA) that included the details of the radio experiments. A large\ndatabase of systematic observations across VLF to HF was collected from radio\namateurs and from the RA Regional Offices allowing comparisons to be made with\nITU estimates. There is a brief look at the scientific results and a forward\nlook as to how the analysis of this disturbance might have impact on the use of\nionospheric models for Space Weather tools in the future.\n", "  The event GW150914 was the first historical detection of gravitational waves\n(GWs). The emergence of this ground-breaking discovery came not only from\nincredibly innovative experimental work, but also from a centennial of\ntheoretical analyses. Many such analyses were performed by pioneering\nscientists who had wandered through a wild territory of mathematical laws. We\nexplore such wandering and explain how it may impact the grand goal of\nunification in physics.\n", "  In this work, we use player behavior during the closed beta test of the\nMMORPG ArcheAge as a proxy for an extreme situation: at the end of the closed\nbeta test, all user data is deleted, and thus, the outcome (or penalty) of\nplayers' in-game behaviors in the last few days loses its meaning. We analyzed\n270 million records of player behavior in the 4th closed beta test of ArcheAge.\nOur findings show that there are no apparent pandemic behavior changes, but\nsome outliers were more likely to exhibit anti-social behavior (e.g., player\nkilling). We also found that contrary to the reassuring adage that \"Even if I\nknew the world would go to pieces tomorrow, I would still plant my apple tree,\"\nplayers abandoned character progression, showing a drastic decrease in quest\ncompletion, leveling, and ability changes at the end of the beta test.\n", "  We present an introduction to a novel model of an individual and group\nopinion dynamics, taking into account different ways in which different sources\nof information are filtered due to cognitive biases. The agent based model,\nusing Bayesian updating of the individual belief distribution, is based on the\nrecent psychology work by Dan Kahan. Open nature of the model allows to study\nthe effects of both static and time-dependent biases and information processing\nfilters. In particular, the paper compares the effects of two important\npsychological mechanisms: the confirmation bias and the politically motivated\nreasoning. Depending on the effectiveness of the information filtering (agent\nbias), the agents confronted with an objective information source may either\nreach a consensus based on the truth, or remain divided despite the evidence.\nIn general, the model might provide an understanding into the increasingly\npolarized modern societies, especially as it allows mixing of different types\nof filters: psychological, social, and algorithmic.\n", "  It is shown that the total set of equations, which determines the dynamics of\nthe domain bounds (DB) in a weak ferromagnet, has the same type of specific\nsolution as the well-known Walker's solution for ferromagnets. We calculated\nthe functional dependence of the velocity of the DB on the magnetic field,\nwhich is described by the obtained solution. This function has a maximum at a\nfinite field and a section of the negative differential mobility of the DB.\nAccording to the calculation, the maximum velocity $ c \\approx 2 \\times 10^6$\ncm/sec in YFeO$_3$ is reached at $H_m \\approx 4 \\times 10^3$ Oe.\n", "  According to quantum theory, randomness is a fundamental property of the\nuniverse yet classical physics is mostly deterministic. In this article I show\nthat it is possible for deterministic systems to arise from random ones and\ndiscuss the implications of this for the concept of free will.\n", "  Surface codes are among the best candidates to ensure the fault-tolerance of\na quantum computer. In order to avoid the accumulation of errors during a\ncomputation, it is crucial to have at our disposal a fast decoding algorithm to\nquickly identify and correct errors as soon as they occur. We propose a\nlinear-time maximum likelihood decoder for surface codes over the quantum\nerasure channel. This decoding algorithm for dealing with qubit loss is optimal\nboth in terms of performance and speed.\n", "  In this work, a relation is found between state dependence of bulk\nobservables in the gauge/gravity correspondence and nonperturbative\ndiffeomorphism invariance. Certain bulk constraints, such as the black hole\ninformation paradox, appear to obstruct the existence of a linear map from bulk\noperators to exact CFT operators that is valid over the entire expected range\nof validity of the bulk effective theory. By formulating the bulk gravitational\nphysics in the Hartle-Hawking framework to address these nonperturbative IR\nquestions, I will demonstrate, in the context of eternal AdS-Schwarzschild,\nthat the problematic operators fail to satisfy the Hamiltonian constraints\nnonperturbatively. In this way, the map between bulk effective theory\nHartle-Hawking wavefunctions and exact CFT states can be linear on the full\nHilbert space.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength compilation of new and previously-published\nphotometry for 55 Galactic field RR Lyrae variables. Individual studies,\nspanning a time baseline of up to 30 years, are self-consistently phased to\nproduce light curves in 10 photometric bands covering the wavelength range from\n0.4 to 4.5 microns. Data smoothing via the GLOESS technique is described and\napplied to generate high-fidelity light curves, from which mean magnitudes,\namplitudes, rise-times, and times of minimum and maximum light are derived.\n60,000 observations were acquired using the new robotic Three-hundred\nMilliMeter Telescope (TMMT), which was first deployed at the Carnegie\nObservatories in Pasadena, CA, and is now permanently installed and operating\nat Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. We provide a full description of the TMMT\nhardware, software, and data reduction pipeline. Archival photometry\ncontributed approximately 31,000 observations. Photometric data are given in\nthe standard Johnson UBV, Kron-Cousins RI, 2MASS JHK, and Spitzer [3.6] & [4.5]\nbandpasses.\n", "  The recent observation of gravitational waves confirms one of the most\ninteresting predictions in general relativity: the black holes. Because the\ngravitational waves detected by LIGO fit very well within general relativity as\na phenomenon produced by two colliding black holes. Then the reality of black\nholes seems almost undoubted today. However, a stronger proof on the reality of\nblack holes would be indicated by the observation of the event horizon, which\nis what defines it. In this article, it is indicated that only the event\nhorizon defines a black hole. There is no mention to the singularity in its\ndefinition. Thus, it will be shown that black holes without a singularity are\npossible. Such black holes are called regular black holes.\n", "  Early and accurate identification of parkinsonian syndromes (PS) involving\npresynaptic degeneration from non-degenerative variants such as Scans Without\nEvidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEDD) and tremor disorders, is important for\neffective patient management as the course, therapy and prognosis differ\nsubstantially between the two groups. In this study, we use Single Photon\nEmission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images from healthy normal, early PD and\nSWEDD subjects, as obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative\n(PPMI) database, and process them to compute shape- and surface fitting-based\nfeatures for the three groups. We use these features to develop and compare\nvarious classification models that can discriminate between scans showing\ndopaminergic deficit, as in PD, from scans without the deficit, as in healthy\nnormal or SWEDD. Along with it, we also compare these features with Striatal\nBinding Ratio (SBR)-based features, which are well-established and clinically\nused, by computing a feature importance score using Random forests technique.\nWe observe that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier gave the best\nperformance with an accuracy of 97.29%. These features also showed higher\nimportance than the SBR-based features. We infer from the study that shape\nanalysis and surface fitting are useful and promising methods for extracting\ndiscriminatory features that can be used to develop diagnostic models that\nmight have the potential to help clinicians in the diagnostic process.\n", "  The spontaneous emergence of collective flows is a generic property of active\nfluids and often leads to chaotic flow patterns characterised by swirls, jets,\nand topological disclinations in their orientation field. However, the ability\nto achieve structured flows and ordered disclinations is of particular\nimportance in the design and control of active systems. By confining an active\nnematic fluid within a channel, we find a regular motion of disclinations, in\nconjunction with a well defined and dynamic vortex lattice. As pairs of moving\ndisclinations travel through the channel, they continually exchange partners\nproducing a dynamic ordered state, reminiscent of Ceilidh dancing. We\nanticipate that this biomimetic ability to self-assemble organised topological\ndisclinations and dynamically structured flow fields in engineered geometries\nwill pave the road towards establishing new active topological microfluidic\ndevices.\n", "  I review some recent work on low-mass star formation, with an emphasis on\ntheory, basic principles, and unresolved questions. Star formation is both a\ngravitational fragmentation problem as well as an accretion problem. Molecular\ncloud structure can be understood as a fragmentation process driven by the\ninterplay of turbulence, magnetic fields, and gravity (acting on either a\ndynamical or ambipolar-diffusion time scale). This results in a natural way to\nunderstand filamentary structure as magnetic ribbons that have an apparent\nwidth that scales differently than the Jeans length. Recent work also shows\nthat stellar mass accretion through a disk is episodic. We show through\nnumerical simulations that bursts of FU Ori type may be clustered, since the\nclump that accretes to the center is tidally sheared apart in its last stage of\ninfall. Finally, we utilize a simplified model of stellar mass accretion and\naccretion termination to derive an analytic form for the initial mass function\nthat has a lognormal-like body and a power-law tail. This scenario is\nconsistent with an expectation of a larger number of substellar objects than\nmay have been previously detected.\n", "  For muonic hydrogen, positronium, and ordinary hydrogen, we show that the\nexistence of a relativistic two-body wave equation whose energy levels are\nphysically accurate to order $(Z\\alpha )^4$ (where $Z\\alpha$ is the binding\ncoupling constant) implies a previously unknown two-body Sommerfeld energy\nformula which can be used to predict energy terms to order $(Z\\alpha )^6$ using\nsimple algebra. Two such terms are verified to be physically correct by earlier\n$(Z\\alpha )^6$ calculations for positronium. For muonic hydrogen and ordinary\nhydrogen, these terms are predictions.\n", "  In this technical note, we address the comments on the energy estimates for\nMagnetoelectric Spin-orbit (MESO) Logic, a new logic device proposed by the\nauthors. We provide an analytical derivation of the switching energy, and\nsupport it with time-domain circuit simulations using a self-consistent\nferroelectric (FE) compact model. While the energy to charge a capacitor is\ndissipated in the interconnect and transistor resistance, we note that the\nenergy to switch a capacitor and a FE is independent of the interconnect\nresistance value to the first order. Also device design can mitigate the\nparasitic energy losses. We further show the circuit simulations for a sub 10\naJ switching operation of a MESO logic device comprehending: a) Energy stored\nin multiferroic; b) Energy dissipation in the resistance of the interconnect,\nRic ; c) Energy dissipation in the inverse spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) spin to\ncharge converter Risoc; d) Supply, ground resistance, and transistor losses. We\nalso identify the requirements for the resistivity of the spin-orbit coupling\nmaterials and address the effect of internal resistance of the spin to charge\nconversion layer. We provide the material parameter space where MESO (with a\nfan-out of 1 and interconnect) achieves sub 10 aJ switching energy with path\nfor scaling via ferroelectric/magnetoelectric/spin-orbit materials development.\n", "  The radiation symmetry and laser-plasma instabilities (LPIs) inside the\nconventional cylindrical hohlraum configuration are the two daunting challenges\non the approach to ignition in indirectly driven inertial confinement fusion.\nRecently, near-vacuum cylindrical hohlraum (NVCH), octahedral spherical\nhohlraum (SH) and novel three-axis cylindrical hohlraum (TACH) were proposed to\nmitigate these issues. While the coupling efficiency might still be a critical\nrisk. In this paper, an advanced three-axis elliptical hohlraum (TAEH) is\nproposed to make a compromise among these hohlraum performance. Preliminary\nsimulations indicate that the TAEH (with a case-to-capsule ratio, CCR=2.8)\ncould provide excellent radiation symmetry during the thorough laser pulse of\nthe high-foot drive, comparable to the ones inside the SH (CCR=5.1) and TACH\n(CCR=2.2). The filling time of plasma affecting the LPIs is between those of SH\nand TACH, and about 1.5 times of that in the ignition hohlraum Rev5-CH of NIC\nand close to the one inside the NVCH (CCR=3.4). In particular, the coupling\nefficiency is about 22%, 29% and 17% higher than the one inside the NVCH, SH\nand TACH, respectively. It would be envisioned that the proposed hohlraum\nconfiguration merits consideration as an alternative route to indirect-drive\nignition, complementary to the traditional cylindrical hohlraum and the\nproposed recently novel hohlraums.\n", "  Sub-nanometer and nanometer-sized tips provide high coherence electron\nsources. Conventionally, the effective source size is estimated from the extent\nof the experimental biprism interference pattern created on the detector by\napplying the van Cittert Zernike theorem. Previously reported experimental\nintensity distributions on the detector exhibit Gaussian distribution and our\nsimulations show that this is an indication that such electron sources must be\nat least partially coherent. This, in turn means that strictly speaking the Van\nCittert Zernike theorem cannot be applied, since it assumes an incoherent\nsource. The approach of applying the van Cittert Zernike theorem is examined in\nmore detail by performing simulations of interference patterns for the electron\nsources of different size and different coherence length, evaluating the\neffective source size from the extent of the simulated interference pattern and\ncomparing the obtained result with the pre-defined value. The intensity\ndistribution of the source is assumed to be Gaussian distributed, as it is\nobserved in experiments. The visibility or the contrast in the simulated\nholograms is found to be always less than 1 which agrees well with previously\nreported experimental results and thus can be explained solely by the Gaussian\nintensity distribution of the source. The effective source size estimated from\nthe extent of the interference pattern turns out to be of about 2-3 times\nlarger than the pre-defined size, but it is approximately equal to the\nintrinsic resolution of the imaging system. A simple formula for estimating the\nintrinsic resolution, which could be useful when employing nano-tips in in-line\nGabor holography or point-projection microscopy, is provided.\n", "  There is only a handful of scanning techniques that can provide surface\ntopography at nanometre resolution. At the same time, there are no methods that\nare capable of non-invasive imaging of the three-dimensional surface topography\nof a thin free-standing crystalline material. Here we propose a new technique -\nthe divergent beam electron diffraction (DBED) and show that it can directly\nimage the inhomogeneity in the atomic positions in a crystal. Such\ninhomogeneities are directly transformed into the intensity contrast in the\nfirst order diffraction spots of DBED patterns and the intensity contrast\nlinearly depends on the wavelength of the employed probing electrons.\nThree-dimensional displacement of atoms as small as 1 angstrom can be detected\nwhen imaged with low-energy electrons (50 - 250 eV). The main advantage of DBED\nis that it allows visualisation of the three-dimensional surface topography and\nstrain distribution at the nanometre scale in non-scanning mode, from a single\nshot diffraction experiment.\n", "  The boundary problem about behavior (oscillations) of the electronic plasmas\nwith arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas in half-space with\nspecular boundary conditions is analytically solved. The kinetic equation of\nVlasov--Boltzmann with integral of collisions of type BGK (Bhatnagar, Gross,\nKrook) and Maxwell equation for electric field are applied. Distribution\nfunction for electrons and electric field in plasma in the form of expansion\nunder eigen solutions of the initial system of equations are received.\nCoefficients of these expansions are found by means of the boundary conditions.\n", "  Although a nuclear spin is weakly coupled to its environment, due to its\nsmall gyromagnetic ratio, its coherence time is limited by the hyperfine\ncoupling to a nearby noisy electron. Here, we propose to utilize continuous\ndynamical decoupling to refocus the coupling to the electron. If the random\nphase accumulated by the nuclear spin through the reduced coupling terms is\nsufficient small, we can increase the nuclear coherence time. Initially, we\ndemonstrate this on a simple case with a two-level electron spin, while taking\nall relevant hyperfine coupling terms and noise terms into account. We then\nextend the analysis to a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond having a three\nlevel structure.\n", "  Recent CMS results on diffraction are presented. These include the\nmeasurements of the soft diffractive cross sections, of the forward rapidity\ngap cross section, of the diffractive dijet cross section, the measurement of a\nlarge rapidity gap in W and Z boson events and the measurement of the\npseudorapidity distribution of charged particles in a single diffractive\nenhanced sample. This last measurement is the first common result of the CMS\nand TOTEM collaborations. Some prospects of common CMS-TOTEM data taking are\nalso discussed.\n", "  It is argued that the strong coupling version of recent experiment [Denkmayr\net al., PRL 118, 010402 (2017)] while correctly estimating the pre-selected\nstates of the neutrons does not perform strong measurements of weak values as\nclaimed.\n", "  This document provides a writeup of contributions to the FCC-ee mini-workshop\non \"Physics behind precision\" held at CERN, on 2-3 February 2016.\n", "  We report on the latest direct searches for light exotics at LHCb, conducted\nduring Run I of LHC. This proceedings are divided into two sections, the first\npart will cover the search for the lepton number violating decay\n${B}\\rightarrow {\\pi^{+}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{-}}$ while the second part will cover the\nsearch for a low mass dark boson in the decay $B^0 \\rightarrow K^{*0}\\chi$,\nwith $\\chi \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $K^{*0} \\rightarrow K^+\\pi^-$. The data\nused in these searches correspond to integrated luminosities of 1.0 and $2.0$\nfb$^{-1}$ collected in $pp$ collisions at centre of mass energies of\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV in $pp$ collisions with the LHCb detector.\n", "  We consider light-induced binding and motion of dielectric microparticles in\nan optical waveguide that gives rise to a back-action effect such as light\ntransmission oscillating with time. Modeling the particles by dielectric slabs\nallows us to solve the problem analytically and obtain a rich variety of\ndynamical regimes both for Newtonian and damped motion. This variety is clearly\nreflected in temporal oscillations of the light transmission. The\ncharacteristic frequencies of the oscillations are within the ultrasound range\nof the order of $10^{5}$ Hz for micron size particles and injected power of the\norder of 100 mW. In addition, we consider driven by propagating light dynamics\nof a dielectric particle inside a Fabry-Perot resonator. These phenomena pave a\nway for optical driving and monitoring of motion of particles in waveguides and\nresonators.\n", "  Observations of an enhanced mass transfer in nanofluids have led to several\npropositions for the underlying cause, but none of them have been clearly\nestablished. Here, we reproduce the enhancement phenomenon within a glass\ncapillary containing fluorescein di-sodium dye solution on one side and alumina\nnanoparticle suspension on the other, avoiding convective interferences present\nearlier. The enhancement is explained by the counter-convective motion of the\ndye solution in response to the diffusiophoretic motion of the nanoparticles\ntowards a higher concentration of the dye. The velocity of the dye front agrees\nwith the theoretical estimate obtained from the diffusiophoretic velocity of\nalumina nanoparticles in a gradient of fluorescein di-sodium electrolyte\nsolution. With a suitably chosen nanofluid, it should now be possible to effect\nthe enhancement (or suppression) of mass transfer of a given solute.\n", "  We present a novel three-dimensional (3D) model of coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) that unifies all key evolutionary aspects of CMEs and encapsulates their\n3D magnetic field configuration. This fully analytic model is capable of\nreproducing the global geometrical shape of a CME with all major deformations\ntaken into account, i.e., deflection, rotation, expansion, \"pancaking\", front\nflattening and rotational skew. Encapsulation of 3D magnetic structure allows\nthe model to reproduce in-situ measurements of magnetic field for trajectories\nof spacecraft-CME encounters of any degree of complexity. As such, the model\ncan be used single-handedly for consistent analysis of both remote and in-situ\nobservations of CMEs at any heliocentric distance. We demonstrate the latter by\nsuccessfully applying the model for analysis of two CMEs.\n", "  The molecular dynamics of solid benzene are extremely complex; especially\nbelow 77 K, its inner mechanics remain mostly unexplored. Benzene is also a\nprototypical molecular crystal that becomes energetically frustrated at low\ntemperatures and usually unusual phenomena accompanies such scenarios. We\nperformed dielectric constant measurements on solid benzene down to 5 K and\nobserved a previously unidentified minimum in the imaginary part of the\ndielectric constant at Tm=17.9 K. Results obtained on deuterated solid benzene\n(C6D6, where D is deuterium) show an isotope effect in the form of a shift of\nthe critical temperature to Tm'=18.9 K. Our findings indicate that at Tm, only\nthe protons without the carbon atoms continue again to undergo rotational\ntunneling about the hexad axes. The deuterons appear to do the same accounting\nfor an indirect observation of a continued and sustained 12-body tunneling\nevent. We discuss how similar experiments performed on hydrogen-based molecular\ncrystals can be exploited to help us obtain more insight on the quantum\nmechanics of many-body tunneling.\n", "  The content of today's social media is becoming more and more rich,\nincreasingly mixing text, images, videos, and audio. It is an intriguing\nresearch question to model the interplay between these different modes in\nattracting user attention and engagement. But in order to pursue this study of\nmultimodal content, we must also account for context: timing effects, community\npreferences, and social factors (e.g., which authors are already popular) also\naffect the amount of feedback and reaction that social-media posts receive. In\nthis work, we separate out the influence of these non-content factors in\nseveral ways. First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the\nsame community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds, this framing\nencourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content\nfeatures. Within that setting, we determine the relative performance of author\nvs. content features. We find that victory usually belongs to \"cats and\ncaptions,\" as visual and textual features together tend to outperform\nidentity-based features. Moreover, our experiments show that when considered in\nisolation, simple unigram text features and deep neural network visual features\nyield the highest accuracy individually, and that the combination of the two\nmodalities generally leads to the best accuracies overall.\n", "  In this paper we give the explicit formulas for the solution of the singular\ngeneralized heat and wave equations on the Euclidian space $\\R^n$.\n", "  In the present paper we argue that the correction to the Higgs mass coming\nfrom the bound state of 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks, predicted early by C.D.\nFroggatt, H.B. Nielsen and L.V. Laperashvili, leads to the Standard Model (SM)\nvacuum stability and confirms the accuracy of the multiple point principle\n(principle of degenerate vacua) for all experimentally valued SM parameters\n(Higgs mass, top-quark mass, etc.). The aim to get the vacua degeneracy\nrequires a mass of the bound state in the region of 770 GeV.\n", "  THz time-domain spectroscopy in transmission mode was applied to study dry\nand wet drawing inks. In specific, cochineal-, indigo- and iron-gall based inks\nhave been investigated; some prepared following ancient recipes and others by\nusing synthetic materials. The THz investigations have been realized on both\npellet samples, made by dried inks blended with polyethylene powder, and\nlayered inks, made by liquid deposition on polyethylene pellicles. We\nimplemented an improved THz spectroscopic technique that enabled the\nmeasurement of the material optical parameters and thicknesses of the layered\nink samples on absolute scale. This experimental investigation shows that the\nTHz techniques have the potentiality to recognize drawing inks by their\nspectroscopic features.\n", "  The interfacial band configuration of the high-k dielectric Al$_2$O$_3$\ndeposited at 120{\\deg}C by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on boron- and\nphosphorus-doped hydrogen-terminated (111) diamond was investigated. Performing\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of core level binding energies\nand valence band maxima values, the valence band offsets of both\nheterojunctions are concluded to be {\\Delta}E$_V$ = 1.8 eV and {\\Delta}E$_V$ =\n2.7 eV for the Al$_2$O$_3$/H(111)p and the Al$_2$O$_3$/H(111)n respectively.\nThe ALD Al$_2$O$_3$ bandgap energy was measured from the O 1s photoelectron\nenergy loss spectra to be $E_G^{ Al_2O_3}$ = 7.1 eV. The interfacial band\ndiagram configuration is concluded to be of type II for both\nAl$_2$O$_3$/H(111)p and Al$_2$O$_3$/H(111)n heterostructures having conduction\nband offsets of {\\Delta}E$_C$ = 0.2 eV and {\\Delta}E$_C$ = 1.1 eV respectively.\nThe use of doped (111) hydrogen-terminated diamond for developing future\ndiamond MOSFET is discussed.\n", "  The dependence of valence band structures of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ with 0 $\\leq$\n$x$ $\\leq$ 0.2 on Sn content, biaxial strain, and substrate orientation is\ncalculated using the nonlocal empirical pseudopotential method. The first\nvalence subband structure in p-type Ge cap/fully strained Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$\nquantum well/Ge (001) and (111) inversion layers are theoretically studied\nusing the 6$\\times$6 k$\\cdot$p model. A wave-function coupling of a Ge cap with\nrespect to a strained Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ quantum well, which is influenced by the\ncap thickness, valence band offset, and confined effective mass, changes the\nenergy dispersion relation in the two-dimensional $k$-space. The increase in Sn\ncontent and the decrease in cap thickness increase the hole population in the\nstrained Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$ quantum well to reduce the transport effective mass\nat the zone center in the Ge/strained Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$/Ge inversion layers.\n", "  We investigate the inherent influence of light polarization on the intensity\ndistribution in anisotropic media undergoing a local inhomogeneous rotation of\nthe principal axes. Whereas in general such configuration implies a complicated\ninteraction between geometric and dynamic phase, we show that, in a medium\nshowing an inhomogeneous circular birefringence, the geometric phase vanishes.\nDue to the spin-orbit interaction, the two circular polarizations perceive\nreversed spatial distribution of the dynamic phase. Based upon this effect,\npolarization-selective lens, waveguides and beam deflectors are proposed.\n", "  The population of known minor bodies in retrograde orbits ($i > 90 ^{\\circ}$)\nthat are classified as asteroids is still growing. The aim of our study was to\nestimate the dynamical lifetimes of these bodies by use of the latest\nobservational data, including astrometry and physical properties. We selected\n25 asteroids with the best determined orbital elements. We studied their\ndynamical evolution in the past and future for $\\pm$ 100 My ($\\pm$ 1 Gy for\nthree particular cases).\n  We first used orbit determination and cloning to produce swarms of test\nparticles. These swarms were then input into long-term numerical integrations\nand orbital elements were averaged. Next, we collected the available thermal\nproperties of our objects and used them in an enhanced dynamical model with\nYarkovsky forces. We also used a gravitational model for comparison. Finally,\nwe estimated the median lifetimes of 25 asteroids.\n  We found three objects whose retrograde orbits were stable with a dynamical\nlifetime $\\tau \\sim 10 \\div 100$ My. A large portion of the objects studied\ndisplayed smaller values of $\\tau$ ($\\tau \\sim 1$ My). In addition, we studied\nthe possible influence of the Yarkovsky effect on our results.\n  We found that the Yarkovsky effect can have a significant influence on the\nlifetimes of asteroids in retrograde orbits. Due to the presence of this\neffect, it is possible that the median lifetimes of these objects are extended.\nAdditionally, the changes in orbital elements, caused by Yarkovsky forces,\nappear to depend on the integration direction. To explain this more precisely,\nthe same model based on new physical parameters, determined from future\nobservations, will be required.\n", "  We revisit the problem of finding the Naimark extension of a probability\noperator-valued measure (POVM), i.e. its implementation as a projective\nmeasurement in a larger Hilbert space. In particular, we suggest an iterative\nmethod to build the projective measurement from the sole requirements of\northogonality and positivity. Our method improves existing ones, as it may be\nemployed also to extend POVMs containing elements with rank larger than one. It\nis also more effective in terms of computational steps.\n", "  In this third of a series of papers related to cataclysmic variables (CVs)\nand related objects, we analyse the population of CVs in a set of 12 globular\ncluster models evolved with the MOCCA Monte Carlo code, for two initial binary\npopulations (IBPs), two choices of common-envelope phase (CEP) parameters, and\nthree different models for the evolution of CVs and the treatment of angular\nmomentum loss. When more realistic models and parameters are considered, we\nfind that present-day cluster CV duty cycles are extremely-low ($\\lesssim 0.1$\nper cent) which makes their detection during outbursts rather difficult.\nAdditionally, the IBP plays a significant role in shaping the CV population\nproperties, and models that follow the Kroupa IBP are less affected by enhanced\nangular momentum loss. We also predict from our simulations that CVs formed\ndynamically in the past few Gyr (massive CVs) correspond to bright CVs (as\nexpected), and that faint CVs formed several Gyr ago (dynamically or not)\nrepresent the overwhelming majority. Regarding the CV formation rate, we rule\nout the notion that it is similar irrespective of the cluster properties.\nFinally, we discuss the differences in the present-day CV properties related to\nthe IBPs, the initial cluster conditions, the CEP parameters, formation\nchannels, the CV evolution models, and the angular momentum loss treatments.\n", "  Material and product life cycles are based on complex value chains of\ntechnology-specific elements. Resource strategy aspects of essential and\nstrategic raw materials have a direct impact on applications of new\nfunctionalized materials or the development of novel products. Thus, an urgent\nchallenge of modern materials science is to obtain information about the supply\nrisk and environmental aspects of resource utilization, especially at an early\nstage of basic research. Combining the fields of materials science, industrial\nengineering and resource strategy enables a multidisciplinary research approach\nto identify specific risks within the value chain, aggregated as the so-called\nresource criticality. Here, we demonstrate a step-by-step criticality\nassessment in the sector of basic materials research for multifunctional\nhexagonal manganite YMnO3, which can be a candidate for future electronic\nsystems. Raw material restrictions can be quantitatively identified, even at\nsuch an early stage of materials research, from eleven long-term indicators\nincluding our new developed Sector Competition Index. This approach for\nresource strategy for modern material science integrates two objective targets:\nreduced supply risk and enhanced environmental sustainability of new\nfunctionalized materials, showing drawbacks but also benefits towards a\nsustainable materials research and development.\n", "  JEM-EUSO is an international collaboration for the development of\nspace--based Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) detectors. The instrument\nconsists of a wide Field Of View (FOV) camera for the detection of the UV light\nemitted by Extensive Air Showers (EAS) in the atmosphere. Within the JEM-EUSO\nframework several pathfinders have been developed or are in course of\ndevelopment: EUSO-TA, EUSO-Balloon, EUSO-SPB and Mini-EUSO. For the near future\nthe K-EUSO detector is foreseen to detect cosmic rays from space. In this paper\nwe present the JEM-EUSO project and give an overview of the pathfinders and of\ntheir results.\n", "  Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems is of exceptional\nrelevance in everyday life, from biology to economy. In order to describe the\ndynamical organization of complex systems, existing methods require the\nknowledge of the network topology. By contrast, in this thesis we develop a new\nmethod based on Information Theory which does not require any topological\nknowledge. We introduce the Dynamical Cluster Index to detect those groups of\nsystem elements which have strong mutual interactions, named as Relevant\nSubsets. Among them, we identify those which exchange most information with the\nrest of the system, thus being the most influential for its dynamics. In order\nto detect such Functional Dynamical Structures, we introduce another\ninformation theoretic measure, called D-index. The experimental results make us\nconfident that our method can be effectively used to study both artificial and\nnatural complex systems.\n", "  In many cases a scalar field can lead to accelerated expansion in\ncosmological models. This paper contains mathematical results on this subject\nparticularly on type I Bianchi space-time. In this paper, global existence to\nthe coupled Einstein-scalar field system which rules the dynamics of a kind of\npure matter in the presence of a scalar field and cosmological constant is\nproven.\n", "  We study analytically the existence and uniqueness of the ground state of the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE) with a general power nonlinearity\ndescribed by the power index $\\sigma\\ge0$. For the NLSE under a box or a\nharmonic potential, we can derive explicitly the approximations of the ground\nstates and their corresponding energy and chemical potential in weak or strong\ninteraction regimes with a fixed nonlinearity $\\sigma$. Besides, we study the\ncase where the nonlinearity $\\sigma\\to\\infty$ with a fixed interaction\nstrength. In particular, a bifurcation in the ground states is observed.\nNumerical results in 1D and 2D will be reported to support our asymptotic\nresults.\n", "  Long-term series of measurement of spectral transparency of the atmosphere\n(\\lambda = 430 nm) and atmospheric optical thickness (AOT) measured by\nmultimode photometer CE 318 in the region of Yakutsk array are analyzed.\nCorrelation of AOT with intensity of air showers with small energies 10^{15} -\n10^{16} eV is found. The variability of aerosol composition of the atmosphere\nduring the registration period of the Cherenkov light should be taken into\naccount since it may affect the quality of determining characteristics of air\nshowers.\n", "  In this work we study the problem of communication over the quantum wiretap\nchannel. For this channel there are three parties Alice (sender), Bob\n(legitimate receiver) and Eve (eavesdropper). We obtain upper and lower bounds\non the amount of information Alice can communicate to Bob such that Eve gets to\nknow as little information as possible about the transmitted messages. Our\nbounds are in terms of quantum hypothesis testing divergence and smooth max\nquantum relative entropy. To obtain our result we prove a one-shot version of\nthe quantum covering lemma along with operator Chernoff bound for non-square\nmatrices.\n", "  A particularly interesting feature of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is\nthe monogamy laws of entanglement. Although the monogamy relation has been\nexplored extensively in the last decade, it is still not clear to what extent a\ngiven entanglement measure is monogamous. We give here a conjecture on the\namount of entanglement contained in the reduced states by observing all the\nknown related results at first. Consequently, we propose the monogamy power of\nan entanglement measure and the polygamy power for its dual quantity, the\nassisted entanglement, and show that both the monogamy power and the polygamy\npower exist in any multipartite systems with any dimension, from which we\nformalize exactly for the first time when an entanglement measure and an\nassisted entanglement obey the monogamy relation and the polygamy relation\nrespectively in a unified way. In addition, we show that any entanglement\nmeasure violates the polygamy relation, which is misstated in some recent\npapers. Only the existence of monogamy power is conditioned on the conjecture,\nall other results are strictly proved.\n", "  This is a brief review of charge asymmetries in top-antitop quark production\nat the LHC. Proposed asymmetry observables in processes of associated top-pair\nproduction $t\\bar t$ + jet, $t\\bar t + W$, and $t\\bar t + \\gamma$ are analyzed\nand compared. While the focus is on standard-model predictions, we also comment\non the sensitivity to possible new physics and observation prospects during the\nsecond runtime of the LHC.\n", "  We compute the rate for diffractive $\\phi$ electro-production using the Color\nGlass Condensate dipole model. The model parameters are obtained from fits to\nthe most recent combined HERA data on inclusive deep inelastic scattering. As\nfor the $\\phi$ meson, we use an AdS/QCD holographic light front wavefunction.\nOur predictions are compared to the available data collected at the HERA\ncollider.\n", "  Research and development on alternative thermal neutron detection\ntechnologies and methods are nowadays needed as a possible replacement of\n3He-based ones. Commercial solid state silicon detectors, coupled with neutron\nconverter layers containing 6Li, have been proved to represent a viable\nsolution for several applications as present in literature. In order to better\nunderstand the detailed operation and the response and efficiency of such\ndetectors, a series of dedicated GEANT4 simulations were performed and compared\nwith real data collected in a few different configurations. The results show a\nremarkable agreement between data and simulations, indicating that the behavior\nof the detector is fully understood.\n", "  We investigate the task of $d$-level random access codes ($d$-RACs) and\nconsider the possibility of encoding classical strings of $d$-level symbols\n(dits) into a quantum system of dimension $d'$ strictly less than $d$. We show\nthat the average success probability of recovering one (randomly chosen) dit\nfrom the encoded string can be larger than that obtained in the best classical\nprotocol for the task. Our result is intriguing as we know from Holevo's\ntheorem (and more recently from Frenkel-Weiner's result [Commun. Math. Phys.\n340, 563 (2015)]) that there exist communication scenarios wherein quantum\nresources prove to be of no advantage over classical resources. A\ndistinguishing feature of our protocol is that it establishes a stronger\nquantum advantage in contrast to the existing quantum $d$-RACs where $d$-level\nquantum systems are shown to be advantageous over their classical $d$-level\ncounterparts.\n", "  Attractive negative-$U$ interactions between electrons facilitated by strong\nelectron-phonon interaction are common in highly polarizable and disordered\nmaterials such as amorphous chalcogenides, but there is no direct evidence for\nthem in large-band-gap insulators. Here we report how such negative-$U$ centers\nare responsible for widespread insulator-to-metal transitions in amorphous\nHfO$_2$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ thin films with a 10$^9$-fold resistance drop.\nTriggered by a static hydraulic pressure or a 0.1 ps impulse of magnetic\npressure, the transition can proceed at such low pressure that there is very\nlittle overall deformation (strain~10$^{-5}$). Absent a significant energy\nchange overall, the transition is attributed to the reversal of localized\nelectron-phonon interaction: By reversing the sign of $U$, trapped electrons\nare destabilized and released, thus clearing conduction paths previously\nblocked by charged traps. The results also suggest that Mott insulators when\ndisordered may become Anderson insulators with strong electron-phonon\ninteractions regulating incipient conduction paths, a novel finding of\ntechnological significance for electronic devices.\n", "  The alignment of the frontier orbital energies of an adsorbed molecule with\nthe substrate Fermi level at metal-organic interfaces is a fundamental\nobservable of significant practical importance in nanoscience and beyond.\nTypical density functional theory calculations, especially those using local\nand semi-local functionals, often underestimate level alignment leading to\ninaccurate electronic structure and charge transport properties. In this work,\nwe develop a new fully self-consistent predictive scheme to accurately compute\nlevel alignment at certain classes of complex heterogeneous molecule-metal\ninterfaces based on optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals.\nStarting from a highly accurate description of the gas-phase electronic\nstructure, our method by construction captures important nonlocal surface\npolarization effects via tuning of the long-range screened exchange in a\nrange-separated hybrid in a non-empirical and system-specific manner. We\nimplement this functional in a plane-wave code and apply it to several\nphysisorbed and chemisorbed molecule-metal interface systems. Our results are\nin quantitative agreement with experiments, both the level alignment and work\nfunction changes. Our approach constitutes a new practical scheme for accurate\nand efficient calculations of the electronic structure of molecule-metal\ninterfaces.\n", "  The paper considers non-stationary responses in reduced-order model of\npartially liquid-filled tank under external forcing. The model involves one\ncommon degree of freedom for the tank and the non-sloshing portion of the\nliquid, and the other one -- for the sloshing portion of the liquid. The\ncoupling between these degrees of freedom is nonlinear, with the lowest-order\npotential dictated by symmetry considerations. Since the mass of the sloshing\nliquid in realistic conditions does not exceed 10% of the total mass of the\nsystem, the reduced-order model turns to be formally equivalent to well-studied\noscillatory systems with nonlinear energy sinks (NES). Exploiting this analogy,\nand applying the methodology known from the studies of the systems with the\nNES, we predict a multitude of possible non-stationary responses in the\nconsidered model. These responses conform, at least on the qualitative level,\nto the responses observed in experimental sloshing settings, multi-modal\ntheoretical models and full-scale numeric simulations.\n", "  Platonic solids such as polyhedra based on DNA have been deployed for\nmultifarious applications such as RNAi delivery, biological targeting and\nbioimaging. All of these applications hinge on the capability of DNA polyhedra\nfor molecular display with high spatial precision. Therefore high resolution\nstructural models of such polyhedra are critical to widen their applications in\nboth materials and biology. Here, we present an atomistic model of a\nwell-characterized DNA icosahedron, with demonstrated versatile functionalities\nin biological systems. We study the structure and dynamics of this DNA\nicosahedron using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation in explicit\nwater and ions. The major modes of internal motion have been identified using\nprincipal component analysis. We provide a quantitative estimate of the radius\nof gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and volume of the\nicosahedron which is essential to estimate its maximal cargo carrying capacity.\nImportantly, our simulation of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) encapsulated within\nDNA icosahedra revealed enhanced stability of the AuNP loaded DNA icosahedra\ncompared to empty icosahedra. This is consistent with experimental results that\nshow high yields of cargo-encapsulated DNA icosahedra that have led to its\ndiverse applications for precision targeting. These studies reveal that the\nstabilizing interactions between the cargo and the DNA scaffold powerfully\npositions DNA polyhedra as targetable nanocapsules for payload delivery. These\ninsights can be exploited for precise molecular display for diverse biological\napplications.\n"]}
