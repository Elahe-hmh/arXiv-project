Two models are constructed that\napproximate known sharp-interface equations without adding undesired\nconstraints. Linear stability of a planar interface is investigated for the\nresulting phase-field equations and shown to reduce to the desired limit.\nFinally, numerical simulations of the standard and a more sophisticated model\nfrom the literature as well as of our two new models are performed to assess\nthe relative merits of each approach. The results suggest superior performance\nof the new models in at least some situations.\n", "  The generation of intrinsic rotation by turbulence and neoclassical effects\nin tokamaks is considered. To obtain the complex dependences observed in\nexperiments, it is necessary to have a model of the radial flux of momentum\nthat redistributes the momentum within the tokamak in the absence of a\npreexisting velocity. When the lowest order gyrokinetic formulation is used, a\nsymmetry of the model precludes this possibility, making small effects in the\ngyroradius over scale length expansion necessary. These effects that are\nusually small become important for momentum transport because the symmetry of\nthe lowest order gyrokinetic formulation leads to the cancellation of the\nlowest order momentum flux. The accuracy to which the gyrokinetic equation\nneeds to be obtained to retain all the physically relevant effects is\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Kruskal-Segur approach to selection theory in diffusion-limited or\nLaplacian growth is extended via combination with the Zauderer decomposition\nscheme. This way nonlinear bulk equations become tractable. To demonstrate the\nmethod, we apply it to two-dimensional crystal growth in a potential flow. We\nomit the simplifying approximations used in a preliminary calculation for the\nsame system [T. Fischaleck, K. Kassner, EPL 81, 54004 (2008)], thus exhibiting\nthe capability of the method to extend mathematical rigor to more complex\nproblems than hitherto accessible.\n", "  We prove that a uniformly chosen proper $3$-coloring of the $d$-dimensional\ndiscrete torus has a very rigid structure when the dimension $d$ is\nsufficiently high. We show that with high probability the coloring takes just\none color on almost all of either the even or the odd sub-torus. In particular,\none color appears on nearly half of the torus sites. This model is the zero\ntemperature case of the $3$-state anti-ferromagnetic Potts model from\nstatistical physics.\n  Our work extends previously obtained results for the discrete torus with\nspecific boundary conditions. The main challenge in this extension is to\novercome certain topological obstructions which appear when no boundary\nconditions are imposed on the model. Locally, a proper $3$-coloring defines the\ndiscrete gradient of an integer-valued height function which changes by exactly\none between adjacent sites. However, these locally-defined functions do not\nalways yield a height function on the entire torus, as the gradients may\naccumulate to a non-zero quantity when winding around the torus. Our main\nresult is that in high dimensions, a global height function is well defined\nwith high probability, allowing to deduce the rigid structure of the coloring\nfrom previously known results. Moreover, the probability that the gradients\naccumulate to a vector $m$, corresponding to the winding in each of the $d$\ndirections, is at most exponentially small in the product of $\\|m\\|_\\infty$ and\nthe area of a cross-section of the torus.\n  In the course of the proof we develop discrete analogues of notions from\nalgebraic topology. This theory is developed in some generality and may be of\nuse in the study of other models.\n", "  Many realistic networks are scale-free, with small characteristic path\nlengths, high clustering, and power law in their degree distribution. They can\nbe obtained by dynamical networks in which a preferential attachment process\ntakes place. However, this mechanism is non-local, in the sense that it\nrequires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be updated.\nInstead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical\nsystems, these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we\npropose a local model and show that a possible ingredient (which is often\nunderrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with local rules is memory. Such\na model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive\nelements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.\n", "  We use the $\\Delta_{\\chi^2}$ statistic introduced in \\cite{gup08,gup10} to\nstudy directional dependence, in the high-z supernovae data. This dependence\ncould arise due to departures from the cosmological principle or from direction\ndependent statistical systematics in the data. We apply our statistic to the\ngold data set from \\cite{rie04} and \\cite{rie07}, and Union2 catalogue from\n\\cite{aman10}. Our results show that all the three data sets show a weak but\nconsistent direction dependence. In 2007 data errors are Gaussian, however\nother two data sets show non-Gaussian features.\n", "  Quasisymmetric stellarators are a type of optimized stellarators for which\nflows are undamped to lowest order in an expansion in the normalized Larmor\nradius. However, perfect quasisymmetry is impossible. Since large flows may be\ndesirable as a means to reduce turbulent transport, it is important to know\nwhen a stellarator can be considered to be sufficiently close to quasisymmetry.\nThe answer to this question depends strongly on the size of the spatial\ngradients of the deviation from quasisymmetry and on the collisionality regime.\nRecently, formal criteria for closeness to quasisymmetry have been derived in a\nvariety of situations. In particular, the case of deviations with large\ngradients was solved in the $1/\\nu$ regime. Denoting by $\\alpha$ a parameter\nthat gives the size of the deviation from quasisymmetry, it was proven that\nparticle fluxes do not scale with $\\alpha^{3/2}$, as typically claimed, but\nwith $\\alpha$. It was also shown that ripple wells are not necessarily the main\ncause of transport. This paper reviews those works and presents a new result in\nanother collisionality regime, in which particles trapped in ripple wells are\ncollisional and the rest are collisionless.\n", "  The development of laser cooling coupled with the ability to trap atoms and\nions in electromagnetic fields, has revolutionised atomic and optical physics,\nleading to the development of atomic clocks, high-resolution spectroscopy and\napplications in quantum simulation and processing. However, complex systems,\nsuch as large molecules and nanoparticles, lack the simple internal resonances\nrequired for laser cooling. Here we report on a hybrid scheme that uses the\nexternal resonance of an optical cavity, combined with radio frequency (RF)\nfields, to trap and cool a single charged nanoparticle. An RF Paul trap allows\nconfinement in vacuum, avoiding instabilities that arise from optical fields\nalone, and crucially actively participates in the cooling process. This system\noffers great promise for cooling and trapping a wide range of complex charged\nparticles with applications in precision force sensing, mass spectrometry,\nexploration of quantum mechanics at large mass scales and the possibility of\ncreating large quantum superpositions.\n", "  The radial flux of toroidal angular momentum is needed to determine tokamak\nintrinsic rotation profiles. Its computation requires knowledge of the\ngyrokinetic distribution functions and turbulent electrostatic potential to\nsecond-order in $\\epsilon = \\rho/L$, where $\\rho$ is the ion Larmor radius and\n$L$ is the variation length of the magnetic field. In this article, a complete\nset of equations to calculate the radial transport of toroidal angular momentum\nin any tokamak is presented. In particular, the $O(\\epsilon^2)$ equations for\nthe turbulent components of the distribution functions and electrostatic\npotential are given for the first time without assuming that the poloidal\nmagnetic field over the magnetic field strength is small.\n", "  The emission pattern from a classical dipole located above and oriented\nperpendicular to a metallic or dielectric half space is calculated for a dipole\ndriven at constant amplitude. This is a problem considered originally by\nSommerfeld and analyzed subsequently by numerous authors. In contrast to most\nprevious treatments, however, we focus on the energy flow in the metal or\ndielectric. It is shown that the radial Poynting vector in the metal points\ninwards when the frequency of the dipole is below the surface plasmon resonance\nfrequency. In this case, energy actually flows of the interface at small radii.\nThe Joule heating in the metal is also calculated and it is shown explicitly\nthat Poynting's theorem holds for a cylindrical surface in the metal. When the\nmetal is replaced by a dielectric having permittivity less than that of the\nmedium in which the dipole is immersed, it is found that energy flows out of\nthe interface for sufficiently large radii. In all cases it is assumed that the\nimaginary part of the permittivity of the metal or dielectric is much less than\nunity.\n", "  A thin conducting sheet - graphene, for example - transmits, absorbs, and\nreflects radiation. A sheet that is very thin, even vanishingly so, can still\nproduce 50% absorption at normal incidence if it has conductivity corresponding\nto half the impedance of free space. We find that, regardless of the sheet\nconductivity, there exists a combination of polarization and angle of incidence\nthat achieves this impedance half-matching condition. If the conducting medium\ncan be inverted, the conductivity is formally negative and the sheet amplifies\nthe incident radiation. To the extent that a negative half-match in a thin\nsheet can be maintained, enormous single-pass gain in both transmission and\nreflection is possible. Known semiconductors (e.g., gallium nitride) have the\noptical properties necessary to give large amplification in a structure that\nis, remarkably, both thin and nonresonant.\n", "  Thin sheets deposited on a substrate and interfaces of correlated materials\noffer a plethora of routes towards the realization of exotic phases of matter.\nIn these systems, inversion symmetry is broken which strongly affects the\nproperties of possible instabilities -- in particular in the superconducting\nchannel. By combining symmetry and energetic arguments, we derive general and\nexperimentally accessible selection rules for Cooper instabilities in\nnoncentrosymmetric systems which yield necessary and sufficient conditions for\nspontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking at the superconducting transition\nand constrain the orientation of the triplet vector. We discuss in detail the\nimplications for various different materials. For instance, we conclude that\nthe pairing state in thin layers of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ must, as opposed to its bulk\nsuperconducting state, preserve time-reversal symmetry with its triplet vector\nbeing parallel to the plane of the system. All pairing states of this system\nallowed by the selection rules are predicted to display topological Majorana\nmodes at dislocations or at the edge of the system. Applying our results to the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures, we find that while the condensates of the\n(001) and (110) oriented interfaces must be time-reversal symmetric,\nspontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking can only occur for the less studied\n(111) interface. We also discuss the consequences for thin layers of\nURu$_2$Si$_2$ and UPt$_3$ as well as for single-layer FeSe. On a more general\nlevel, our considerations might serve as a design principle in the search for\ntime-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity in the absence of external\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  In the linear collisionless limit, a zonal potential perturbation in a\ntoroidal plasma relaxes, in general, to a non-zero residual value. Expressions\nfor the residual value in tokamak and stellarator geometries, and for arbitrary\nwavelengths, are derived. These expressions involve averages over the lowest\norder particle trajectories, that typically cannot be evaluated analytically.\nIn this work, an efficient numerical method for the evaluation of such\nexpressions is reported. It is shown that this method is faster than direct\ngyrokinetic simulations performed with the GENE and EUTERPE codes. Calculations\nof the residual value in stellarators are provided for much shorter wavelengths\nthan previously available in the literature. Electrons must be treated\nkinetically in stellarators because, unlike in tokamaks, kinetic electrons\nmodify the residual value even at long wavelengths. This effect, that had\nalready been predicted theoretically, is confirmed by gyrokinetic simulations.\n", "  The 1-2 model on the hexagonal lattice is a model of statistical mechanics in\nwhich each vertex is constrained to have degree either $1$ or $2$. There are\nthree types of edge, and three corresponding parameters $a$, $b$, $c$. It is\nproved that, when $a \\ge b \\ge c > 0$, the surface given by $\\sqrt a = \\sqrt b\n+ \\sqrt c$ is critical. The proof hinges upon a representation of the partition\nfunction in terms of that of a certain dimer model. This dimer model may be\nstudied via the Pfaffian representation of Fisher, Kasteleyn, and Temperley. It\nis proved, in addition, that the two-edge correlation function converges\nexponentially fast with distance when $\\sqrt a \\ne \\sqrt b + \\sqrt c$. Many of\nthe results may be extended to periodic models.\n", "  We investigate beam scanning by lateral feed displacement in novel\nmetasurface based reflector antennas with extremely short focal distances.\nElectric field distributions of the waves reflected from the antenna are\nstudied numerically and experimentally for defocusing angles up to 24 degree.\nThe results show that despite their sub-wavelength focal distances, the\nscanning ability of metamirrors is similar to that of short-focus reflectarrays\n(focal distance about several wavelengths). In addition to offering a\npossibility to realize extremely small focal distances, metamirror antennas are\npractically penetrable and invisible for any radiation outside of the operating\nfrequency range.\n", "  In this work we present an efficient implementation of Canonical Monte Carlo\nsimulation for Coulomb many body systems on graphics processing units (GPU).\nOur method takes advantage of the GPU Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)\narchitectures. It adopts the sequential updating scheme of Metropolis\nalgorithm, and makes no approximation in the computation of energy. It reaches\na remarkable 440-fold speedup, compared with the serial implementation on CPU.\nWe use this method to simulate primitive model electrolytes. We measure very\nprecisely all ion-ion pair correlation functions at high concentrations, and\nextract renormalized Debye length, renormalized valences of constituent ions,\nand renormalized dielectric constants. These results demonstrate unequivocally\nphysics beyond the classical Poisson-Boltzmann theory.\n", "  The notion of the black hole singularity and the proof of the singularity\ntheorem were considered great successes in classical general relativity.\nSingularities had presented deep puzzles to physicists. Conceptual challenges\nwere set up by the intractability of the singularity. The existence of black\nhole horizons which cover up the interior, including the singularity of the\nblack hole from outside observers, builds an information curtain, further\nhindering physicists from understanding the nature of the singularity and the\ninterior structure of black holes. The regular black hole is a concept produced\nout of multiple attempts of establishing a tractable and understandable\ninterior structure for black hole as well as avoiding the singularity behind\nthe black hole horizon. A method is needed to check the correctness of the new\nconstructions of black holes. After studying the Hawking radiation by fermion\ntunnelling from one type of regular black hole, structure dependent results\nwere obtained. The result being structure dependent points out the prospects of\nemploying the Hawking radiation as a method to probe into the structure of\nblack holes.\n", "  As is well-known, the Schwarzschild metric cannot be derived based on\npre-general-relativistic physics alone, which means using only special\nrelativity, the Einstein equivalence principle and the Newtonian limit. The\nstandard way to derive it is to employ Einstein's field equations. Yet, analogy\nwith Newtonian gravity and electrodynamics suggests that a more constructive\nway towards the gravitational field of a point mass might exist. As it turns\nout, the additional physics needed is captured in two plausible postulates.\nThese permit to deduce the exact Schwarzschild metric without invoking the\nfield equations. Since they express requirements essentially designed for use\nwith the spherically symmetric case, they are less general and powerful than\nthe postulates from which Einstein constructed the field equations. It is shown\nthat these imply the postulates given here but that the converse is not quite\ntrue. The approach provides a fairly fast method to calculate the Schwarzschild\nmetric in arbitrary coordinates exhibiting stationarity and sheds new light on\nthe behavior of waves in gravitational fields.\n", "  We provide a simple way for calculating the entropy of a Schwarzschild black\nhole from the entropy of its Hawking radiation. To this end, we show that if a\nthermodynamic system loses its energy only through the black body radiation,\nits loss of entropy is always 3/4 of the entropy of the emitted radiation. This\nproposition enables us to relate the entropy of an evaporating black hole to\nthe entropy of its Hawking radiation. Explicitly, by calculating the entropy of\nthe Hawking radiation emitted in the full period of evaporation of the black\nhole, we find the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the initial black hole.\n", "  The self energy of $\\Delta$-baryon is evaluated at finite temperature and\ndensity using the real time formalism of thermal field theory. The\nDyson-Schwinger equation is used to get the exact thermal propagator followed\nby the spectral function of $\\Delta$. The $\\pi N$ scattering cross section\nobtained using explicit $\\Delta$ exchange is normalized to the experimental\ndata in vacuum and its medium modification is implemented by means of the exact\nthermal propagator. A significant suppression of the peak of the cross-section\nis observed at higher temperature and baryon density. Effects on the mean\nrelaxation time of nucleons and the temperature dependence of the shear\nviscosity of a pion nucleon gas are demonstrated.\n", "  The nature of random errors in any data set that is Gaussian is a well\nestablished fact according to the Central Limit Theorem. Supernovae type Ia\ndata have played a crucial role in major discoveries in cosmology. Unlike in\nlaboratory experiments, astronomical measurements can not be performed in\ncontrolled situations. Thus, errors in astronomical data can be more severe in\nterms of systematics and non-Gaussianity compared to those of laboratory\nexperiments. In this paper, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to test\nnon-Gaussianity in high-z supernovae data. We apply this statistic to four data\nsets, i.e., Gold data(2004), Gold data(2007), Union2 catalogue and the Union2.1\ndata set for our analysis. Our results shows that in all four data sets the\nerrors are consistent with the Gaussian distribution.\n", "  We propose an algorithm to determine Maximally Localized Wannier Functions\n(MLWFs). This algorithm, based on recent theoretical developments, does not\nrequire any physical input such as initial guesses for the Wannier functions,\nunlike popular schemes based on the projection method. We discuss how the\nprojection method can fail on fine grids when the initial guesses are too far\nfrom MLWFs. We demonstrate that our algorithm is able to find localized Wannier\nfunctions through tests on two-dimensional systems, simplified models of\nsemiconductors, and realistic DFT systems by interfacing with the Wannier90\ncode. We also test our algorithm on the Haldane and Kane-Mele models to examine\nhow it fails in the presence of topological obstructions.\n", "  We review the number counts to second order concentrating on the terms which\ndominate on sub horizon scales. We re-derive the result for these terms and\ncompare it with the different versions found in the literature. We generalize\nour derivation to higher order terms, especially the third order number counts\nwhich are needed to compute the 1-loop contribution to the power spectrum.\n", "  In this study, we introduce a relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation\nof the spin-1 particle as an excited state of the zitterbewegung and show that\nit is consistent with the 2+1 dimensional Proca theory. At the same time, we\nsee that in the rest frame this equation has two eigenstates, particle and\nantiparticle states or negative and positive energy eigenstates, respectively,\nand satisfy $SO(2,1)$ spin algebra. As practical applications, we derive the\nexact solutions of the equation in the presence of a constant magnetic field\nand a curved spacetime. From these solutions, we find Noether charge by\nintegrating the constructed spin-1 particle current on hyper surface and\ndiscuss pair production from the charge. And, we see that the discussion on \\\nthe Noether charge is useful tool for undersdantding the pair production\nphenomenon because the charge is derived from a probabilistic particle current.\n", "  Consistency conditions for nonminimally coupled $f(R)$ theories have been\nderived by requiring the absence of tachyons and instabilities in the scalar\nfluctuations. This note confirms these results and clarifies a subtlety\nregarding different definitions of sound speeds.\n", "  We prove a local law in the bulk of the spectrum for random Gram matrices\n$XX^*$, a generalization of sample covariance matrices, where $X$ is a large\nmatrix with independent, centered entries with arbitrary variances. The\nlimiting eigenvalue density that generalizes the Marchenko-Pastur law is\ndetermined by solving a system of nonlinear equations. Our entrywise and\naveraged local laws are on the optimal scale with the optimal error bounds.\nThey hold both in the square case (hard edge) and in the properly rectangular\ncase (soft edge). In the latter case we also establish a macroscopic gap away\nfrom zero in the spectrum of $XX^*$.\n", "  An open question of fundamental importance in thermodynamics is how to\ndescribe the fluctuations of work for quantum coherent processes. In the\nstandard approach, based on a projective energy measurement both at the\nbeginning and at the end of the process, the first measurement destroys any\ninitial coherence in the energy basis. Here we seek for extensions of this\napproach which can possibly account for initially coherent states. We consider\nall measurement schemes to estimate work and require that (i) the difference of\naverage energy corresponds to average work for closed quantum systems, and that\n(ii) the work statistics agree with the standard two-measurement scheme for\nstates with no coherence in the energy basis. We first show that such a scheme\ncannot exist. Next, we consider the possibility of performing collective\nmeasurements on several copies of the state and prove that it is still\nimpossible to satisfy simultaneously requirements (i) and (ii). Nevertheless,\nimprovements do appear, and in particular we develop a measurement scheme which\nacts simultaneously on two copies of the state and allows to describe a whole\nclass of coherent transformations.\n", "  A model is presented in which O(10 TeV) stop masses, typically required by\nthe Higgs boson mass in supersymmetric models, do not originate from soft\nsupersymmetry breaking terms that would drive the Higgs mass squared parameter\nto large negative values but rather from the mixing with vectorlike partners.\nTheir contribution to the Higgs mass squared parameter is reduced to threshold\ncorrections and, thus, it is one loop suppressed compared to usual scenarios.\nNew fermion and scalar partners of the top quark with O(10 TeV) masses are\npredicted.\n", "  The $\\mathrm{^2H}(d,p)\\mathrm{^3H}$ bare nucleus astrophysical S(E) factor\nhas been measured indirectly at energies from about 500 keV down to several keV\nby means of the Trojan-horse method applied to the quasi-free process\n$\\mathrm{^2H({}^6Li},pt)\\mathrm{^4He}$ induced at the lithium beam energy of 11\nand 9.5 MeV, which makes the virtual binary process incident energy $\\mathrm\n{E}_{dd}^{qf}$ go much closer to the zero-quasi-free-energy point than that in\nthe previous similar experiment. The obtained results are compared with direct\ndata as well as with previous indirect investigation of the same binary\nreactions. It shows that the precision of S(E) data in low energy range\nextracted via the same Trojan horse nucleus ($\\mathrm{^6Li}=(d \\oplus \\alpha)$\n) becomes better when the incident energy decreases from high value down to the\nzero-quasi-free-energy point. The very good agreement between data extracted\nfrom different Trojan horse nucleus ($\\mathrm{^6Li}=(d \\oplus \\alpha)$ vs.\n$\\mathrm{^3He}=(d \\oplus p)$) gives a strong updated test for the independence\nof the binary indirect cross section on the chosen Trojan horse nucleus at low\nenergies.\n", "  We discuss different sets of defining constants, fixed values of which are\nconsidered in connection with the transition to new definitions of four SI\nunits (the kilogram, the mole, the ampere, and the kelvin). The notion of\nconstant's order in a given system of units is suggested. We propose an\nalternative set of fixed constants applicable for new definitions of the four\nSI units. We analyse and discuss in detail the set, which consists of the\nPlanck constant, the Avogadro constant, the Boltzmann constant and the magnetic\nconstant.\n", "  The case for the utility of Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates in classroom made by\nAugousti et al. in this journal (Eur. J. Phys. 33:1--11, 2012) is strengthened\nby extending their discussion beyond the event horizon of the black hole.\nObservations made by two adventurers following one another into a Schwarzschild\nblack hole are examined in terms of these nonsingular coordinates. Two\nscenarios are considered, the first corresponding to one observer following the\nother closely, the second to a significant distance between the two of them,\nprecluding the existence of a common inertial system. In particular, the\nconcepts of distance and temporal separation near the horizon and the redshift\nof the first infaller's image as seen by the second are investigated. The\nresults show that the notion of \"touching ghosts\" does not correspond to the\nlocal physics of two observers falling into a black hole. The story line is\ninteresting enough and the mathematical details are sufficiently simple to use\nthe example in a general relativity course, even at the undergraduate level.\n", "  We entertain the possibility that primordialblack holes of mass $\\sim\n(10^{26}$--$10^{29})$~g, with Schwarzschild radii of $\\mathcal{O}{\\text{cm}}$,\nconstitute $\\sim 10\\%$ or more of cosmic dark matter, as allowed by various\nconstraints. These black holes would typically originate from cosmological eras\ncorresponding to temperatures $\\mathcal{O}{10-100}$~GeV, and may be associated\nwith first order phase transitions in the visible or hidden sectors. In case\nthese small primordial black holes get captured in orbits around neutron stars\nor astrophysical black holes in our galactic neighborhood, gravitational waves\nfrom the resulting \"David and Goliath (D\\&G)\" binaries could be detectable at\nAdvanced LIGO or Advanced Virgo for hours or more, possibly over distances of\n$\\mathcal{O}{10}$~Mpc encompassing the Local Supercluster of galaxies. The\nproposed Einstein Telescope would further expand the reach for these signals. A\npositive signal could be further corroborated by the discovery of new particles\nin the $\\mathcal{O}{10-100}$~GeV mass range, and potentially also the detection\nof long wavelength gravitational waves originating from the first order phase\ntransition era.\n", "  Scientists are drawn to synchrotrons and accelerator based light sources\nbecause of their brightness, coherence and flux. The rate of improvement in\nbrightness and detector technology has outpaced Moore's law growth seen for\ncomputers, networks, and storage, and is enabling novel observations and\ndiscoveries with faster frame rates, larger fields of view, higher resolution,\nand higher dimensionality. Here we present an integrated software/algorithmic\nframework designed to capitalize on high throughput experiments, and describe\nthe streamlined processing pipeline of ptychography data analysis. The pipeline\nprovides throughput, compression, and resolution as well as rapid feedback to\nthe microscope operators.\n", "  Most types of supernovae (SNe) have yet to be connected with their progenitor\nstellar systems. Here, we reanalyze the 10-year SN sample collected during\n1998-2008 by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) in order to constrain\nthe progenitors of SNe Ia and stripped-envelope SNe (SE SNe, i.e., SNe~IIb, Ib,\nIc, and broad-lined Ic). We matched the LOSS galaxy sample with spectroscopy\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and measured SN rates as a function of galaxy\nstellar mass, specific star formation rate, and oxygen abundance (metallicity).\nWe find significant correlations between the SN rates and all three galaxy\nproperties. The SN Ia correlations are consistent with other measurements, as\nwell as with our previous explanation of these measurements in the form of a\ncombination of the SN Ia delay-time distribution and the correlation between\ngalaxy mass and age. The ratio between the SE SN and SN II rates declines\nsignificantly in low-mass galaxies. This rules out single stars as SE~SN\nprogenitors, and is consistent with predictions from binary-system progenitor\nmodels. Using well-known galaxy scaling relations, any correlation between the\nrates and one of the galaxy properties examined here can be expressed as a\ncorrelation with the other two. These redundant correlations preclude us from\nestablishing causality - that is, from ascertaining which of the galaxy\nproperties (or their combination) is the physical driver for the difference\nbetween the SE SN and SN II rates. We outline several methods that have the\npotential to overcome this problem in future works.\n", "  In Paper I of this series, we showed that the ratio between stripped-envelope\n(SE) supernova (SN) and Type II SN rates reveals a significant SE SN deficiency\nin galaxies with stellar masses $\\lesssim 10^{10}~{\\rm M}_\\odot$. Here, we test\nthis result by splitting the volume-limited subsample of the Lick Observatory\nSupernova Search (LOSS) SN sample into low- and high-mass galaxies and\ncomparing the relative rates of various SN types found in them. The LOSS\nvolume-limited sample contains 180 SNe and SN impostors and is complete for SNe\nIa out to 80 Mpc and core-collapse SNe out to 60 Mpc. All of these transients\nwere recently reclassified by us in Shivvers et al. (2017). We find that the\nrelative rates of some types of SNe differ between low- and high-mass galaxies:\nSNe Ib and Ic are underrepresented by a factor of ~3 in low-mass galaxies.\nThese galaxies also contain the only examples of SN 1987A-like SNe in the\nsample and host about 9 times as many SN impostors. Normal SNe Ia seem to be\n~30\\% more common in low-mass galaxies, making these galaxies better sources\nfor homogeneous SN Ia cosmology samples. The relative rates of SNe IIb are\nconsistent in both low- and high-mass galaxies. The same is true for broad-line\nSNe Ic, although our sample includes only two such objects. The results\npresented here are in tension with a similar analysis from the Palomar\nTransient Factory, especially as regards SNe IIb.\n", "  The competition for the attention of users is a central element of the\nInternet. Crucial issues are the origin and predictability of big hits, the few\nitems that capture a big portion of the total attention. We address these\nissues analyzing 10 million time series of videos' views from YouTube. We find\nthat the average gain of views is linearly proportional to the number of views\na video already has, in agreement with usual rich-get-richer mechanisms and\nGibrat's law, but this fails to explain the prevalence of big hits. The reason\nis that the fluctuations around the average views are themselves heavy tailed.\nBased on these empirical observations, we propose a stochastic differential\nequation with L\\'evy noise as a model of the dynamics of videos. We show how\nthis model is substantially better in estimating the probability of an ordinary\nitem becoming a big hit, which is considerably underestimated in the\ntraditional proportional-growth models.\n", "  The existence of a self-localization transition in the polaron problem has\nbeen under an active debate ever since Landau suggested it 83 years ago. Here\nwe reveal the self-localization transition for the rotational analogue of the\npolaron -- the angulon quasiparticle. We show that, unlike for the polarons,\nself-localization of angulons occurs at finite impurity-bath coupling already\nat the mean-field level. The transition is accompanied by the\nspherical-symmetry breaking of the angulon ground state and a discontinuity in\nthe first derivative of the ground-state energy. Moreover, the type of the\nsymmetry breaking is dictated by the symmetry of the microscopic impurity-bath\ninteraction, which leads to a number of distinct self-localized states. The\npredicted effects can potentially be addressed in experiments on cold molecules\ntrapped in superfluid helium droplets and ultracold quantum gases, as well as\non electronic excitations in solids and Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  Same- and opposite-sign charge asymmetries are measured in lepton+jets\n$t\\bar{t}$ events in which a $b$-hadron decays semileptonically to a soft muon,\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ from\nproton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV\ncollected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The\ncharge asymmetries are based on the charge of the lepton from the top-quark\ndecay and the charge of the soft muon from the semileptonic decay of a\n$b$-hadron and are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the\nexperimental acceptance. Four CP asymmetries (one mixing and three direct) are\nmeasured and are found to be compatible with zero and consistent with the\nStandard Model.\n", "  In this work, we focus on the theory of Gravito-Electromagnetism (GEM) -- the\ntheory that describes the dynamics of the gravitational field in terms of\nquantities met in Electromagnetism -- and we propose two novel forms of metric\nperturbations. The first one is a generalisation of the traditional GEM ansatz,\nand succeeds in reproducing the whole set of Maxwell's equations even for a\ndynamical vector potential A. The second form, the so-called alternative\nansatz, goes beyond that leading to an expression for the Lorentz force that\nmatches the one of Electromagnetism and is free of additional terms even for a\ndynamical scalar potential \\Phi. In the context of the linearised theory, we\nthen search for scalar invariant quantities in analogy to Electromagnetism. We\ndefine three novel, 3rd-rank gravitational tensors, and demonstrate that the\nlast two can be employed to construct scalar quantities that succeed in giving\nresults very similar to those found in Electromagnetism. Finally, the gauge\ninvariance of the linearised gravitational theory is studied, and shown to lead\nto the gauge invariance of the GEM fields E and B for a general configuration\nof the arbitrary vector involved in the coordinate transformations.\n", "  Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is an indispensable tool for many practical\napplications including material analysis and sensing. Existing IR spectroscopy\ntechniques face challenges related to the inferior performance and the high\ncost of IR-grade components. Here, we develop a new method, which allows\nstudying properties of materials in the IR range using only visible light\noptics and detectors. It is based on the nonlinear interference of entangled\nphotons, generated via Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC). In our\ninterferometer, the phase of the signal photon in the visible range depends on\nthe phase of an entangled IR photon. When the IR photon is traveling through\nthe media, its properties can be found from observations of the visible photon.\nWe directly acquire the SPDC signal with a visible range CCD camera and use a\nnumerical algorithm to infer the absorption coefficient and the refraction\nindex of the sample in the IR range. Our method does not require the use of a\nspectrometer and a slit, thus it allows achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio\nthan the earlier developed method.\n", "  Macroscopic fluctuations have become an essential tool to understand physics\nfar from equilibrium due to the link between their statistics and\nnonequilibrium ensembles. The optimal path leading to a fluctuation encodes key\ninformation on this problem, shedding light on e.g. the physics behind the\nenhanced probability of rare events out of equilibrium, the possibility of\ndynamic phase transitions and new symmetries. This makes the understanding of\nthe properties of these optimal paths a central issue. Here we derive a\nfundamental relation which strongly constraints the architecture of these\noptimal paths for general $d$-dimensional nonequilibrium diffusive systems, and\nimplies a non-trivial structure for the dominant current vector fields.\nInterestingly, this general relation (which encompasses and explains previous\nresults) makes manifest the spatio-temporal non-locality of the current\nstatistics and the associated optimal trajectories.\n", "  Shaping the electron wavefunction in three dimensions may prove to be an\nindispensable tool for research involving atomic-sized particle trapping,\nmanipulation, and synthesis. We utilize computer-generated holograms to sculpt\nelectron wavefunctions in a standard transmission electron microscope in 3D,\nand demonstrate the formation of electron beams exhibiting high intensity along\nspecific trajectories as well as shaping the beam into a 3D lattice of\nhot-spots. The concepts presented here are similar to those used in light\noptics for trapping and tweezing of particles, but at atomic scale resolutions.\n", "  In the study of open quantum systems, one of the most common ways to describe\nenvironmental effects on the reduced dynamics is through the spectral density.\nHowever, in many models this object cannot be computed from first principles\nand needs to be inferred on phenomenological grounds or fitted to experimental\ndata. Consequently, some uncertainty regarding its form and parameters is\nunavoidable; this in turn calls into question the accuracy of any theoretical\npredictions based on a given spectral density. Here, we focus on the spin-boson\nmodel as a prototypical open quantum system, and find two error bounds on\npredicted expectation values in terms of the spectral density variation\nconsidered, and state a sufficient condition for the strongest one to apply. We\nfurther demonstrate an application of our result, by bounding the error brought\nabout by the approximations involved in the Hierarchical Equations of Motion\nresolution method for spin-boson dynamics.\n", "  We study the physics of adhesion and the contact mechanics at the nanoscale\nwith a peeling experiment of a carbon nanotube on a flat substrate. Using an\ninterferometric atomic force microscope and an extended force modulation\nprotocol, we investigate the frequency response of the stiffness of the\nnano-contact from DC to 20 kHz. We show that this dynamic stiffness is only\nweakly frequency dependent, increasing by a factor 2 when the frequency grows\nby 3 orders of magnitude. Such behavior may be the signature of amorphous\nrelaxations during the mechanical solicitation at the nano-scale.\n", "  We propose a new method for optomechanical quantum non-demolition (QND)\ndetection of phonon number, based on a \"shelving\" style measurement. The scheme\nuses a two-mode optomechanical system where the frequency splitting of the two\nphotonic modes is near-resonant with the mechanical frequency. The combination\nof a strong optical drive and the underlying nonlinear optomechanical\ninteraction gives rise to spin-like dynamics which facilitate the measurement.\nThis approach allows phonon number measurement to be accomplished\nparametrically faster than in other schemes which are restricted to weak\ndriving. The ultimate power of the scheme is controlled by the size of the\nsingle photon optomechanical cooperativity.\n", "  We study sample-to-sample fluctuations in a critical two-dimensional Ising\nmodel with quenched random ferromagnetic couplings. Using replica calculations\nin the renormalization group framework we derive explicit expressions for the\nprobability distribution function of the critical internal energy and for the\nspecific heat fluctuations. It is shown that the disorder distribution of\ninternal energies is Gaussian, and the typical sample-to-sample fluctuations as\nwell as the average value scale with the system size $L$ like $\\sim L\n\\ln\\ln(L)$. In contrast, the specific heat is shown to be self-averaging with a\ndistribution function that tends to a $\\delta$-peak in the thermodynamic limit\n$L \\to \\infty$. While previously a lack of self-averaging was found for the\nfree energy, we here obtain results for quantities that are directly measurable\nin simulations, and implications for measurements in the actual lattice system\nare discussed.\n", "  While thermodynamics is a useful tool to describe the driving of large\nsystems close to equilibrium, fluctuations dominate the distribution of heat\nand work in small systems and far from equilibrium. We study the heat generated\nby driving a small system and change the drive parameters to analyse the\ntransition from a drive leaving the system close to equilibrium to driving it\nfar from equilibrium. Our system is a quantum dot in a GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructure hosting a two-dimensional electron gas. The dot is\ntunnel-coupled to one part of the two-dimensional electron gas acting as a heat\nand particle reservoir. We use standard rate equations to model the driven\ndot-reservoir system and find excellent agreement with the experiment.\nAdditionally, we quantify the fluctuations by experimentally test the\ntheoretical concept of the arrow of time, predicting our ability to distinguish\nwhether a process goes in the forward or backward drive direction.\n", "  Light and heavy charged Higgs bosons are predicted by many models with an\nextended Higgs sector such as the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). Searches for\nthe charged Higgs bosons have been done by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in proton-proton collision. However, a\ndefinitive search is a program that still has to be carried out so this belongs\nto the LHC experiments. The experimental observation of charged Higgs bosons\nwould indicate physics beyond the Standard Model. In the present work we study\nthe ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ correction to the energy spectrum of the inclusive\nbottom-flavored mesons $(X_b)$ in polarized top quark decays into a light\ncharged Higgs boson ($m_{H^+}<m_t$) and a massless bottom quark followed by the\nhadronization process $b\\to X_b$ in the 2HDM, i.e. $t(\\uparrow)\\to H^+b\\to\nH^+X_b+Jet$. This spin-dependent energy distribution is studied in two\ndifferent helicity coordinate systems. This study could be considered as a new\nchannel to search for the charged Higgs bosons. To present our phenomenological\npredictions, we restrict ourselves to the unexcluded regions of the MSSM\n$m_{H^+}-\\tan\\beta$ parameter space determined by the recent results of the CMS\nand the ATLAS collaborations.\n", "  The coalescence of a binary neutron star (BNS) pair is expected to produce\ngravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, both of which may\nbe detectable with currently available instruments. We describe a search for a\ntheoretically predicted r-process optical transient from these mergers, dubbed\nthe kilonova (KN), using griz broadband data from the Dark Energy Survey\nSupernova Program (DES-SN). Some models predict KNe to be redder,\nshorter-lived, and dimmer than supernovae (SNe), but at present the event rate\nof KNe is poorly constrained. We simulate observations of KN and SN light\ncurves with the Monte-Carlo simulation code SNANA to optimize selection\nrequirements, determine search efficiency, and predict SN backgrounds. We also\nperform an analysis using fake point sources on images to account for anomalous\nefficiency losses from difference-imaging on bright low-redshift galaxies. Our\nanalysis of the first two seasons of DES-SN data results in 0 events, and is\nconsistent with our prediction of 1.1 background events based on simulations of\nSN. Given our simulation prediction, there is a 33 percent chance of finding 0\nevents in the data. Assuming no underlying galaxy flux, our search sets 90\npercent upper limits on the KN volumetric rate of $1.0\\times10^7$ Gpc$^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$ for the dimmest KN model we consider (peak i-band absolute magnitude\n$M_i=-11.4$ mag) and $2.4\\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the brightest\n($M_i=-16.2$ mag). Accounting for efficiency loss from host galaxy Poisson\nnoise, these limits are 1.1 times higher; accounting for anomalous subtraction\nartifacts on bright galaxies, these limits are ~3 times higher. While previous\nKN searches were based on triggered follow-up, this analysis is the first\nuntriggered optical KN search and informs selection requirements and strategies\nfor future KN searches and GW follow-up observations.\n", "  Classical turbulence theory assumes that energy transport in a 3D turbulent\nflow proceeds through a Richardson cascade whereby larger vortices successively\ndecay into smaller ones. By contrast, an additional inverse cascade\ncharacterized by vortex growth exists in 2D fluids and gases, with profound\nimplications for meteorological flows and fluid mixing. The possibility of a\nhelicity-driven inverse cascade in 3D fluids had been rejected in the 1970s\nbased on equilibrium-thermodynamic arguments. Recently, however, it was\nproposed that certain symmetry-breaking processes could potentially trigger a\n3D inverse cascade, but no physical system exhibiting this phenomenon has been\nidentified to date. Here, we present analytical and numerical evidence for the\nexistence of an inverse energy cascade in an experimentally validated 3D active\nfluid model, describing microbial suspension flows that spontaneously break\nmirror symmetry. We show analytically that self-organized scale selection, a\ngeneric feature of many biological and engineered nonequilibrium fluids, can\ngenerate parity-violating Beltrami flows. Our simulations further demonstrate\nhow active scale selection controls mirror-symmetry breaking and the emergence\nof a 3D inverse cascade.\n", "  We study scenarios where there exists an exotic massive particle charged\nunder QCD in the early Universe. We calculate the formation and dissociation\nrates of bound states formed by pairs of these particles, and apply the results\nin dark matter (DM) coannihilation scenarios, including also the Sommerfeld\neffect. We find that on top of the Sommerfeld enhancement, bound-state effects\ncan further significantly increase the largest possible DM masses which can\ngive the observed DM relic abundance, by $\\sim 30 - 100\\%$ with respect to\nvalues obtained by considering the Sommerfeld effect only, for the color\ntriplet or octet exotic particles we consider. In particular, it indicates that\nthe Bino DM mass in the right-handed stop-Bino coannihilation scenario in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) can reach $\\sim\n2.5$ TeV, even though the potential between the stop and antistop prior to\nforming a bound state is repulsive. We also apply the bound-state effects in\nthe calculations of relic abundance of long-lived or metastable massive colored\nparticles, and discuss the implications on the BBN constraints and the\nabundance of a super-weakly interacting DM. The corrections for the bound-state\neffect when the exotic massive colored particles also carry electric charges,\nand the collider bounds are also discussed.\n", "  A general problem of $2\\rightarrow N_f$ scattering is addressed with all the\nstates being wave packets with arbitrary phases. Depending on these phases, one\ndeals with coherent states in $(3+1)$ D, vortex particles with orbital angular\nmomentum, the Airy beams, and their generalizations. A method is developed in\nwhich a number of events represents a functional of the Wigner functions of\nsuch states. Using width of a packet $\\sigma_p/\\langle p\\rangle$ as a small\nparameter, the Wigner functions, the number of events, and a cross section are\nrepresented as power series in this parameter, the first non-vanishing\ncorrections to their plane-wave expressions are derived, and generalizations\nfor beams are made. Although in this regime the Wigner functions turn out to be\neverywhere positive, the cross section develops new specifically quantum\nfeatures, inaccessible in the plane-wave approximation. Among them is\ndependence on an impact parameter between the beams, on phases of the incoming\nstates, and on a phase of the scattering amplitude. A model-independent\nanalysis of these effects is made. Two ways of measuring how a Coulomb phase\nand a hadronic one change with a transferred momentum $t$ are discussed.\n", "  We analyse the signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the\nscotogenic model, when the lightest Z2-odd particle is a singlet fermion and a\nfeebly interacting massive particle (FIMP). We further assume that the singlet\nfermion constitutes the dark matter and that it is produced in the early\nUniverse via the freeze-in mechanism. The small couplings required to reproduce\nthe observed dark matter abundance translate into decay-lengths for the\nnext-to-lightest Z2-odd particle which can be macroscopic, potentially leading\nto spectacular signatures at the LHC. We characterize the possible signals of\nthe model according to the spectrum of the Z2-odd particles and we derive, for\neach of the cases, bounds on the parameters of the model from current searches.\n", "  We perform a qualitative and thermodynamic study of two models when one takes\ninto account adiabatic particle production. In the first one, there is a\nconstant particle production rate, which leads to solutions depicting the\ncurrent cosmic acceleration but without inflation. The other one has solutions\nthat unify the early and late time acceleration. These solutions converge\nasymptotically to the thermal equilibrium.\n", "  We study the transverse momentum ($Q_T$) distribution of an electro-weak\nvector boson produced via the Drell-Yan mechanism, in the context of joint\nresummation. This formalism allows for the simultaneous resummation of\nlogarithmic contributions that are enhanced at small $Q_T$ and at partonic\nthreshold. We extend joint resummation to next-to-next-to leading logarithmic\naccuracy and we present resummed and matched results for three different\nphenomenological setups. In particular, we study the production of a $Z$ boson\nat the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), as well as the\nproduction of a heavier $Z^\\prime$ at the LHC. We compare our findings to\nstandard $Q_T$ resummation, as well as to fixed-order perturbation theory. We\nfind that joint resummation provides a moderate (but not flat) correction with\nrespect to $Q_T$ resummation and it leads to a reduction of the scale\ndependence of the results. However, our study also shows some limitations of\nthis formalism. While the use of joint resummation for $Z$ production at the\nTevatron and $Z^\\prime$ production at the LHC appears to be justified, our\nimplementation suffers from a stronger dependence on power corrections for\nprocesses which are further away from threshold, such as $Z$ production at the\nLHC, for which we cannot claim an improvement over standard $Q_T$ resummation.\n", "  We present results from high-resolution, optical to near-IR imaging of host\nstars of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs), identified in the original Kepler\nfield. Part of the data were obtained under the Kepler imaging follow-up\nobservation program over seven years (2009 - 2015). Almost 90% of stars that\nare hosts to planet candidates or confirmed planets were observed. We combine\nmeasurements of companions to KOI host stars from different bands to create a\ncomprehensive catalog of projected separations, position angles, and magnitude\ndifferences for all detected companion stars (some of which may not be bound).\nOur compilation includes 2297 companions around 1903 primary stars. From\nhigh-resolution imaging, we find that ~10% (~30%) of the observed stars have at\nleast one companion detected within 1\" (4\"). The true fraction of systems with\nclose (< ~4\") companions is larger than the observed one due to the limited\nsensitivities of the imaging data. We derive correction factors for planet\nradii caused by the dilution of the transit depth: assuming that planets orbit\nthe primary stars or the brightest companion stars, the average correction\nfactors are 1.06 and 3.09, respectively. The true effect of transit dilution\nlies in between these two cases and varies with each system. Applying these\nfactors to planet radii decreases the number of KOI planets with radii smaller\nthan 2 R_Earth by ~2-23% and thus affects planet occurrence rates. This effect\nwill also be important for the yield of small planets from future transit\nmissions such as TESS.\n", "  In superconductors with strong coupling between superconductivity and\nelasticity manifested in a strong dependence of transition temperature on\npressure, there is an additional contribution to inter-vortex interactions due\nto the strain field generated by vortices. When vortex lines are along the $c$\naxis of a tetragonal crystal, a square vortex lattice (VL) is favored at low\nvortex densities, because the vortex-induced strains contribution to the\ninter-vortex interactions is long range. At intermediate magnetic fields, the\ntriangular lattice is stabilized. The triangular lattice evolves to the square\nlattice upon increasing magnetic field, and eventually the system locks to the\nsquare structure. We argue, however, that as $B$ approaches $H_{c2}$ the\nelastic inter-vortex interactions disappear faster than the standard London\ninteractions, so that VL should return to the triangular structure. Our results\nare compared to VLs observed in the heavy fermion superconductor\n$\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$.\n", "  We study molecular beam epitaxially grown, undoped\nAl$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$Sb/InAs/AlSb quantum wells with different buffer and barrier\ndesigns and varying quantum well width. The highest mobilities were achieved\nwith Al$_{0.33}$Ga$_{0.67}$Sb buffers and lower barriers and a quantum well\nwidth of 24 nm. These quasi-single-interface InAs/AlSb quantum well devices\nreached a gate-tuned mobility of 2.4$~\\times~10^{6}~$cm$^2$/Vs at a density of\n1$\\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 1.3 K. In Hall bar devices boundary scattering\nis found to strongly influence the mobility determination in this mobility\nregime. Ionized background impurity scattering at low electron densities,\ndevice boundary scattering at intermediate electron densities, and intersubband\nscattering at high electron densities were identified as most likely dominant\nscattering processes. Ringlike structures in the Landau fan can be explained\nusing a single-particle model of crossing Landau levels.\n", "  We investigate the renormalization group evolution of fermion masses, mixings\nand quartic scalar Higgs self-couplings in an ${\\it extended}$\nnon-supersymmetric SO(10) model, where the Higgs sector contains the ${\\bf\n10}_{\\rm H}$, ${\\bf 120}_{\\rm H}$, and ${\\bf 126}_{\\rm H}$ representations. The\ngroup SO(10) is spontaneously broken at the GUT scale to the Pati-Salam group\nand subsequently to the Standard Model (SM) at an intermediate scale $M_{\\rm\nI}$. We explicitly take into account the effects of the change of gauge groups\nin the evolution. In particular, we derive the renormalization group equations\nfor the different Yukawa couplings. We find that the computed physical fermion\nobservables can be successfully matched to the experimental measured values at\nthe electroweak scale. Using the same Yukawa couplings at the GUT scale, the\nmeasured values of the fermion observables cannot be reproduced with a SM-like\nevolution, leading to differences in the numerical values up to around 80 %.\nFurthermore, a similar evolution can be performed for a ${\\it minimal}$ SO(10)\nmodel, where the Higgs sector consists of the ${\\bf 10}_{\\rm H}$ and ${\\bf\n126}_{\\rm H}$ representations only, showing an equally good potential to\ndescribe the low-energy fermion observables. Finally, for both the extended and\nthe minimal SO(10) models, we present predictions for the three Dirac and\nMajorana CP-violating phases as well as three effective neutrino mass\nparameters.\n", "  A simple model of nonlinear salt-finger convection in two dimensions is\nderived and studied. The model is valid in the limit of small solute to heat\ndiffusivity ratio and large density ratio, which is relevant to both\noceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the\nmagnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers,\nappropriate for astrophysical applications, a modified Rayleigh-B\\'enard system\nwith large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For\nlarge Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines\na prognostic equation for the solute field and a diagnostic equation for\ninertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identified\nfor the second model: The weakly driven regime is characterized by a\nlarge-scale flow associated with a balance between advection and linear\ninstability, while the strongly driven regime produces multiscale structures,\nresulting in a balance between the energy input through linear instability and\nthe energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict\nand numerically confirm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity\nfluxes on the ratio between solute and heat Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and\nprobability density functions are also computed.\n", "  We present a new method to derive oxygen and carbon abundances using the\nultraviolet (UV) lines emitted by the gas-phase ionised by massive stars. The\nmethod is based on the comparison of the nebular emission-line ratios with\nthose predicted by a large grid of photo-ionisation models. Given the large\ndispersion in the O/H - C/O plane, our method firstly fixes C/O using ratios of\nappropriate emission lines and, in a second step, calculates O/H and the\nionisation parameter from carbon lines in the UV. We find abundances totally\nconsistent with those provided by the direct method when we apply this method\nto a sample of objects with an empirical determination of the electron\ntemperature using optical emission lines. The proposed methodology appears as a\npowerful tool for systematic studies of nebular abundances in star-forming\ngalaxies at high redshift.\n", "  Distinctions between quark to $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar\\Lambda$ longitudinal spin\ntransfers in the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering process were observed\nby the E665 and COMPASS Collaborations. There are suggestions that the\ndifference between $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar\\Lambda$ production is related to the\nasymmetric strange-antistrange distribution inside the nucleon. However,\nprevious calculations are still too small to explain the experimental data.\nFrom a realistic consideration of quark to $\\Lambda$ fragmentation due to\ndifferent flavors, we investigate the strange quark contribution for $\\Lambda$\nproduction and polarization. We find that the strange quark-antiquark asymmetry\nof the nucleon sea can be amplified into an observable quantity from the\ndifference between $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar\\Lambda$ polarizations after taking into\naccount the larger probability of the $\\Lambda$ produced from the $s$ quark\nfragmentation process compared to that from the $u$ or $d$ quark. The\nqualitative agreement between our calculation and the experimental data\nsupports the existence of the intrinsic strange sea and the strange-antistrange\nasymmetry. Thus the polarization of $\\Lambda/\\bar\\Lambda$ does open a new\nwindow to probe the nucleon sea properties, especially the strange content and\nits quark-antiquark asymmetry.\n", "  We investigate the scattering of single photons by single atoms and, in\nparticular, the dependence of the atomic dynamics and the scattering\nprobability on the photon bandwidth. We tightly focus the incident photons onto\na single trapped~$^{87}${Rb} atom and use the time-resolved transmission to\ncharacterize the interaction strength. Decreasing the bandwidth of the single\nphotons from 6 to~2 times the atomic linewidth, we observe an increase in\natomic peak excitation and photon scattering probability.\n", "  Massive stars, at least $\\sim$ 10 times more massive than the Sun, have two\nkey properties that make them the main drivers of evolution of star clusters,\ngalaxies, and the Universe as a whole. On the one hand, the outer layers of\nmassive stars are so hot that they produce most of the ionizing ultraviolet\nradiation of galaxies; in fact, the first massive stars helped to re-ionize the\nUniverse after its Dark Ages. Another important property of massive stars are\nthe strong stellar winds and outflows they produce. This mass loss, and finally\nthe explosion of a massive star as a supernova or a gamma-ray burst, provide a\nsignificant input of mechanical and radiative energy into the interstellar\nspace. These two properties together make massive stars one of the most\nimportant cosmic engines: they trigger the star formation and enrich the\ninterstellar medium with heavy elements, that ultimately leads to formation of\nEarth-like rocky planets and the development of complex life. The study of\nmassive star winds is thus a truly multidisciplinary field and has a wide\nimpact on different areas of astronomy. [...]\n  This detailed review summarises the current knowledge on the theory and\nobservations of winds from massive stars, as well as on observations and\naccretion processes in wind-fed high mass X-ray binaries. The aim is to combine\nin the near future all available theoretical diagnostics and observational\nmeasurements to achieve a unified picture of massive star winds in isolated\nobjects and in binary systems.\n", "  I introduced the quadratic gauge for $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory and\ndemonstrated its substantial implications in the non-perturbative theory in my\nprevious works. An interesting case is to understand its implications in a\nperturbative regime and ask whether they differ anyway from the well\nestablished theory in this regime. Here I aim to calculate the beta function at\none loop level in the same gauge.\n", "  We propose a new approach to the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin\nbased on the notion of Airy structure, which we introduce in the paper. We\nexplain why Airy structure is a more fundamental object than the one of the\nspectral curve. We explain how the concept of quantization of Airy structure\nleads naturally to the formulas of topological recursion as well as their\ngeneralizations. The notion of spectral curve is also considered in a more\ngeneral framework of Poisson surfaces endowed with foliation. We explain how\nthe deformation theory of spectral curves is related to Airy structures. Few\nother topics (e.g. the Holomorphic Anomaly Equation) are also discussed from\nthe general point of view of Airy structures.\n", "  We present our recent study on baryon-baryon ($BB$) interactions from lattice\nQCD with almost physical quark masses corresponding to\n$(m_\\pi,m_K)\\approx(146,525)$ MeV and large volume $(La)^4=(96a)^4\\approx$ (8.1\nfm)$^4$. In order to perform a comprehensive study of $BB$ interactions based\non lattice QCD calculation with almost physical masses and to make better use\nof such large scale computer resources, a large number of $BB$ interactions\nfrom $NN$ to $\\Xi\\Xi$ are calculated simultaneously. In this report, we focus\non the strangeness $S=-1$ channels of the hyperon interactions by means of HAL\nQCD method. The coupled-channel HAL QCD method is briefly outlined. The\nsnapshots of central and tensor potentials in $^1S_0$ and $^3S_1-^3D_1$\nchannels are presented for $\\Lambda N$, $\\Sigma N$ (both the isospin $I=1/2,\n3/2$) and their coupled-channel systems.\n", "  Photocurrent in solids is an important phenomenon with many applications\nincluding the solar cells. In conventional photoconductors, the electrons and\nholes created by light irradiation are separated by the external electric\nfield, resulting in a current flowing into electrodes. Shift current in\nnoncentrosymmetric systems is distinct from this conventional photocurrent in\nthe sense that no external electric field is needed, and, more remarkably, is\ndriven by the Berry phase inherent to the Bloch wavefunction. It is analogous\nto the polarization current in the ground state but is a d.c. current\ncontinuously supported by the nonequilibrium steady state under the pumping by\nlight. Here we show theoretically, by employing Keldysh-Floquet formalism\napplied to a simple one-dimensional model, that the local photo excitation can\ninduce the shift current which is independent of the position and width of the\nexcited region and also the length of the system. This feature is in stark\ncontrast to the conventional photocurrent, which is suppressed when the sample\nis excited locally at the middle and increases towards the electrodes. This\nfinding reveals the unconventional nature of shift current and will pave a way\nto design a highly efficient photovoltaic effect in solids.\n", "  We apply moderate-high-energy inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements\nto investigate Yb$^{3+}$ crystalline electric field (CEF) levels in the\ntriangular spin-liquid candidate YbMgGaO$_4$. Three CEF excitations from the\nground-state Kramers doublet are centered at the energies $\\hbar \\omega$ = 39,\n61, and 97\\,meV in agreement with the effective \\mbox{spin-1/2} $g$-factors and\nexperimental heat capacity, but reveal sizable broadening. We argue that this\nbroadening originates from the site mixing between Mg$^{2+}$ and Ga$^{3+}$\ngiving rise to a distribution of Yb--O distances and orientations and, thus, of\nCEF parameters that account for the peculiar energy profile of the CEF\nexcitations. The CEF randomness gives rise to a distribution of the effective\nspin-1/2 $g$-factors and explains the unprecedented broadening of low-energy\nmagnetic excitations in the fully polarized ferromagnetic phase of YbMgGaO$_4$,\nalthough a distribution of magnetic couplings due to the Mg/Ga disorder may be\nimportant as well.\n", "  In the quest for stable 2D arsenic phases, four different structures have\nbeen recently claimed to be stable. We show that, due to phonon contributions,\nthe relative stability of those structures differs from previous reports and\ndepends crucially on temperature. We also show that one of those four phases is\nin fact mechanically unstable. Furthermore, our results challenge the common\nassumption of an inverse correlation between structural complexity and thermal\nconductivity. Instead, a richer picture emerges from our results, showing how\nharmonic interactions, anharmonicity and symmetries all play a role in\nmodulating thermal conduction in arsenenes. More generally, our conclusions\nhighlight how vibrational properties are an essential element to be carefully\ntaken into account in theoretical searches for new 2D materials.\n", "  We make biframe and quaternion extensions on the noncommutative geometry, and\nconstruct the biframe spacetime for the unification of gravity and quantum\nfield theory. The extended geometry distinguishes between the ordinary\nspacetime based on the frame bundle and an extra non-coordinate spacetime based\non the biframe bundle constructed by our extensions. The ordinary spacetime\nframe is globally flat and plays the role as the spacetime frame in which the\nfields of the standard model are defined. The non-coordinate frame is locally\nflat and is the gravity spacetime frame. The field defined in both frames of\nsuch \"flat\" biframe spacetime can be quantized and plays the role as the\ngravity field which couples with all the fields to connect the gravity effect\nwith the standard model. Thus we provide a geometric paradigm in which gravity\nand the quantum field theory can be unified.\n", "  Based on variable components global optimization algorithm, we predict a\nstable two-dimensional (2D) phase of boron phosphide with 1:5 stoichiometry,\ni.e. boron pentaphosphide (BP_5) monolayer, which has a lower formation energy\nthan that of the commonly believed graphitic phase (g-BP). BP_5 monolayer is a\nmultiferroic material with coupled ferroelasticity and ferroelectricity. The\npredicted reversible strain is up to 41.41%, which is the largest among all\nreported ferroelastic materials. Due to the non-centrosymmetric structure and\nelectronegativity differences between boron and phosphorus atoms, an in-plane\nspontaneous polarization of 326.0 pC/m occurs in BP_5. Moreover, the recently\nhunted negative Poisson's ratio property, is also observed in BP_5. As an\nindirect semiconductor with a band gap of 1.34 eV, BP_5 displays outstanding\noptical and electronic properties, for instance strongly anisotropic\nvisible-light absorption and high carrier mobility. The rich and extraordinary\nproperties of BP_5 make it a potential nanomaterial for designing\nelectromechanical or optoelectronic devices, such as nonvolatile memory with\nconveniently readable/writeable capability. Finally, we demonstrate that AlN\n(010) surface could be a suitable substrate for epitaxy growth of BP_5\nmonolayer.\n", "  Black holes are important astrophysical objects describing an end state of\nstellar evolution, which are observed frequently. There are theoretical\npredictions that Kerr black holes with high spins expel magnetic fields.\nHowever, Kerr black holes are pure vacuum solutions, which do not include\naccretion disks, and additionally previous investigations are mainly limited to\nweak magnetic fields. We prove for the first time in full general relativity\nthat generic rapidly spinning black holes including those deformed by accretion\ndisks still expel even strong magnetic fields. Analogously to a similar\nproperty of superconductors, this is called Meissner effect.\n", "  This note announces results on the relations between the approach of\nBeilinson and Drinfeld to the geometric Langlands correspondence based on\nconformal field theory, the approach of Kapustin and Witten based on $N=4$ SYM,\nand the AGT-correspondence. The geometric Langlands correspondence is described\nas the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of a generalisation of the AGT-correspondence\nin the presence of surface operators. Following the approaches of Kapustin -\nWitten and Nekrasov - Witten we interpret some aspects of the resulting picture\nusing an effective description in terms of two-dimensional sigma models having\nHitchin's moduli spaces as target-manifold.\n", "  We investigate the energy landscape of the spherical mixed even p-spin model\nnear its maximum energy. We relate the distance between pairs of near maxima to\nthe support of the Parisi measure at zero temperature. We then provide an\nalgebraic relation that characterizes one-step replica symmetric breaking\nParisi measures. For these measures, we show that any two nonparallel spin\nconfigurations around the maximum energy are asymptotically orthogonal to each\nother. In sharp contrast, we study models with full replica symmetry breaking\nand show that all possible values of the asymptotic distance are attained near\nthe maximum energy.\n", "  755 new CCD observations during the years 2014-2016 have been reduced to\nderive the precise positions of Triton, the first satellite of Neptune. The\nobservations were made by the 1 m telescope at Yunnan Observatory over fifteen\nnights. The positions of Triton are measured with respect to the stars in Gaia\nDR1 star catalogue. The theoretical position of Triton was retrieved from the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) ephemeris nep081xl, while the position of\nNeptune was obtained from the JPL ephemeris DE431mx. Our results show that the\nmean O-Cs (observed minus computed) are 0.042 and -0.006 arcsec in right\nascension and declination respectively. The dispersions of our observations are\nestimated at about 0.012 arcsec in each direction.\n", "  The Hall term has often been neglected in MHD codes as it is difficult to\ncompute. Nevertheless setting it aside for numerical reasons led to ignoring it\naltogether. This is especially problematic when dealing with tokamak physics as\nthe Hall term cannot be neglected as this paper shows.\n", "  Recently Aadne and Gr{\\o}n have argued that dark energy may follow naturally\nfrom a Nash theory of gravity. In this brief note I argue why this cannot be\nthe case.\n", "  The nature of Na ion distribution, diffusion path, and the spin structure of\n$P2$-type Na$_2$Ni$_2$TeO$_6$ with a Ni honeycomb network has been explored.\nThe nuclear density distribution of Na ions reveals a 2D chiral pattern within\nNa layers without breaking the original 3D crystal symmetry, which has been\nachieved uniquely via an inverse Fourier transform (iFT)-assisted neutron\ndiffraction technique. The Na diffusion pathway described by the calculated\niso-surface of Na ion bond valence sum (BVS) map is found consistent to a\nchiral diffusion mechanism. The Na site occupancy and Ni$^{2+}$ spin ordering\nwere examined in detail with the electron density mapping, neutron diffraction,\nmagnetic susceptibility, specific heat, thermal conductivity and transport\nmeasurements. Signatures of both strong incommensurate (ICM) and weak\ncommensurate (CM) antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin ordering were identified in the\npolycrystalline sample studied, and the CM-AFM spin ordering was confirmed by\nusing a single crystal sample through the $k$-scan in the momentum space\ncorresponding to the AFM peak of ($\\frac{1}{2}$, 0, 1).\n", "  As the most successful microscopic superconductivity theory,\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) theory has a very peculiar prediction: at zero\ntemperature, only a fraction of electrons within an energy shell form Cooper\npair and condense, but all electrons participate to form a macroscopic\nsuperfluid and contribute to the superfluid density (inverse square of\npenetration depth). Very recently, this prediction was challenged by directly\nmeasuring the penetration depth upon doping in overdoped cuprates. (Bozovic et\nal., 2016) Here, we show that such a counter-intuitive prediction of BCS theory\nis not right. The key point is to disentangle two fundamental concepts in\nsuperconductors: plasma frequency and superfluid density, which were thought to\nbe equal for more than half a century. In our theory, superfluid density is\ndetermined only by paired electrons while plasma frequency by all electrons. As\na consequence, the widely used technique to obtain superfluid density through\noptical conductivity, based on Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule, measures only\nplasma frequency but not superfluid density. Our theory has been evidenced by\nexisted anomalous scaling laws in different experiments.\n", "  Motivated by low energy effective action of string theory and large\napplications of BTZ black holes, we will consider minimal coupling between\ndilaton and nonlinear electromagnetic fields in three dimensions. The main goal\nis studying thermodynamical structure of black holes in this set up.\nTemperature and heat capacity of these black holes are investigated and a\npicture regarding their phase transitions is given. In addition, the role and\nimportance of studying the mass of black holes is highlighted. We will see how\ndifferent parameters modify thermodynamical quantities, hence thermodynamical\nstructure of these black holes. In addition, geometrical thermodynamics is used\nto investigate thermodynamical properties of these black holes. In this regard,\nthe successful method is presented and the nature of interaction around bound\nand phase transition points is studied.\n", "  It is shown that calculation of the momentum Fisher information of the\nquasione- dimensional hydrogen atom recently presented by Saha et al (2017 Eur.\nJ. Phys. {\\bf 38} 025103) is wrong. A correct derivation is provided and its\ndidactical advantages and scientific significances are highlighted.\n", "  The generation of neutrino masses by inverse seesaw mechanisms has advantages\nover other seesaw models because the possible new particles of the former can\nbe detected at the TeV scale. We propose a model that generates the inverse\nseesaw mechanism via spontaneous breaking of the lepton number. In the minimal\nrealization, we extend the Standard Model (SM) with two scalars and two\nfermions, both groups carrying lepton number but being singlets under the SM\ngauge group. Moreover, the scalar sector allows spontaneously broken CP\nsymmetry as result of the lepton charge assignment. The model gives rise to two\npseudoscalar particles: a massless and a massive Majorons, which correspond to\nthe goldstone boson of the lepton number breaking and a massive pseudoscalar\nrespectively. The latter can take the role of dark matter with main decay\nchannels to neutrinos and massless Majorons. In this scenario, we examine the\nmodel phenomenology under the light of the dark matter lifetime. We found that\nthe decay mode to neutrinos is sensitive to $\\omega$, which is the ratio\nbetween the vevs of the new scalars. We found that the decay mode vanishes\ncompletely when $\\omega \\simeq \\sqrt{2/3}$. The decay width to scalars is\ncrucial because it can destabilize drastically the dark matter. However, we\nfound that this width vanishes completely in a certain region of the parameter\nspace. Besides, we suggest a modification to the model solving the scalar decay\nproblem. Finally, we propose a set of mechanisms that explain the Majoron dark\nmatter relic abundance.\n", "  The Wikipedia is a web portal created by users and its simplicity, references\nand also the inclusion as insets introductory paragraphs for their pages in\nGoogle search results have made it the go-to place to find out about current\nevents or people featured in them. Besides, its open application programming\ninterface (API) allows any user to know about the number of visits some\nparticular page has. In this paper, after certain events that made Copernicus a\nviral meme in Spain, we study the intensity and duration of the increment of\nvisits to his page and other pages related to the event. Using pages related to\nother persons as a comparison, we try to establish a typical duration of\nnotoriety achieved through social networks, mainly comparing with visits in\nprevious years in the same dates. We conclude that a 7 day duration is the\nstatistical mode and that this duration is relatively independent of the\ninitial increase in the number of visits.\n", "  We use first-principles density functional theory total energy and linear\nresponse phonon calculations to compute the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energy as\na function of temperature, pressure, and cell volume in the flexible\nmetal-organic framework material MIL-53(Cr) within the quasiharmonic\napproximation. GGA and metaGGA calculations were performed, each including\nempirical van der Waals (vdW) forces under the D2, D3, or D3(BJ)\nparameterizations. At all temperatures up to 500 K and pressures from -30 MPa\nto 30 MPa, two minima in the free energy versus volume are found, corresponding\nto the narrow pore ($np$) and large pore ($lp$) structures. Critical positive\nand negative pressures are identified, beyond which there is only one free\nenergy minimum. While all results overestimated the stability of the $np$ phase\nrelative to the $lp$ phase, the best overall agreement with experiment is found\nfor the metaGGA PBEsol+RTPSS+U+J approach with D3 or D3(BJ) vdW forces. For\nthese parameterizations, the calculated free energy barrier for the $np$-$lp$\ntransition is only 3 to 6 kJ per mole of Cr$_4$(OH)$_4$(C$_8$H$_4$O$_4$)$_4$.\n", "  We test the time evolution of quite general initial states in a model that is\nexactly solvable, $i.e.$ a semi-infinite $XY$ spin chain with an impurity at\nthe boundary. The dynamics is portrayed through the observation of the site\nmagnetization along the chain, focusing on the long-time behavior of the\nmagnetization, which is estimated using the stationary phase method. Localized\nstates are split off from the continuum for some regions of the impurity\nparameter space. Bound states are essential for the non-ergodic behavior\nreported here. When two impurity states exist, the quantum interference between\nthem leads to magnetization oscillations which settle over very long times with\nthe absence of damping. The frequency of the remanent oscillation is recognized\nas being the Rabi frequency of the localized levels.\n", "  Native horse mucus is characterized with micro- and macrorheology and\ncompared to hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) gel as a model. Both systems show\ncomparable viscoelastic properties on the microscale and for the HEC the\nmacrorheology is in good agreement with the microrheology. For the mucus, the\nviscoelastic moduli on the macroscale are several orders of magnitude larger\nthan on the microscale. Large amplitude oscillatory shear experiments show that\nthe mucus responds nonlinearly at much smaller deformations than HEC. This\nbehavior fosters the assumption that the mucus has a foam like structure on the\nmicroscale compared to the typical mesh like structure of the HEC, a model that\nis supported by cryogenic-scanning-electron-microscopy (CSEM) images. These\nimages allow also to determine the relative amount of volume that is occupied\nby the pores and the scaffold. Consequently, we can estimate the elastic\nmodulus of the scaffold. We conclude that this particular foam like\nmicrostructure should be considered as a key factor for the transport of\nparticulate matter which plays a central role in mucus function with respect to\nparticle penetration. The mesh properties composed of very different components\nare responsible for macroscopic and microscopic behavior being part of\nparticles fate after landing.\n", "  The advances in geometric approaches to optical devices due to transformation\noptics has led to the development of cloaks, concentrators, and other devices.\nIt has also been shown that transformation optics can be used to gravitational\nfields from general relativity. However, the technique is currently constrained\nto linear devices, as a consistent approach to nonlinearity (including both the\ncase of a nonlinear background medium and a nonlinear transformation) remains\nan open question. Here we show that nonlinearity can be incorporated into\ntransformation optics in a consistent way. We use this to illustrate a number\nof novel effects, including cloaking an optical soliton, modeling nonlinear\nsolutions to Einstein's field equations, controlling transport in a Debye\nsolid, and developing a set of constitutive to relations for relativistic\ncloaks in arbitrary nonlinear backgrounds.\n", "  Most binary superlattices created using DNA functionalization or other\napproaches rely on particle size differences to achieve compositional order and\nstructural diversity. Here we study two-dimensional (2D) assembly of\nDNA-functionalized micron-sized particles (DFPs), and employ a strategy that\nleverages the tunable disparity in interparticle interactions, and thus\nenthalpic driving forces, to open new avenues for design of binary\nsuperlattices that do not rely on the ability to tune particle size (i.e.,\nentropic driving forces). Our strategy employs tailored blends of complementary\nstrands of ssDNA to control interparticle interactions between micron-sized\nsilica particles in a binary mixture to create compositionally diverse 2D\nlattices. We show that the particle arrangement can be further controlled by\nchanging the stoichiometry of the binary mixture in certain cases. With this\napproach, we demonstrate the abil- ity to program the particle assembly into\nsquare, pentagonal, and hexagonal lattices. In addition, different particle\ntypes can be compositionally ordered in square checkerboard and hexagonal -\nalternating string, honeycomb, and Kagome arrangements.\n", "  Shift of higher harmonic peak in the spectrum of synchrotron radiation with\nincreasing energy of the radiating particle is investigated by numerical\nmethod. Calculations were carried out for the range till 100 harmonics for all\npolarization components.\n", "  Accurate, experimental rovibronic energy levels, with associated labels and\nuncertainties, are reported for 11 low-lying electronic states of the diatomic\n\\TiO\\ molecule, determined using the \\Marvel\\ (Measured Active\nRotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) algorithm. All levels are based on lines\ncorresponding to critically reviewed and validated high-resolution experimental\nspectra taken from 24 literature sources. The transition data are in the 2 $-$\n22,160 \\cm{} region. Out of the 49,679 measured transitions, 43,885 are\ntriplet-triplet, 5710 are singlet-singlet and 84 are triplet-singlet\ntransitions. A careful analysis of the resulting experimental spectroscopic\nnetwork (SN) allows 48,590 transitions to be validated. The transitions\ndetermine 93 vibrational band origins of \\TiO\\, including 71 triplet and 22\nsinglet ones. There are 276 (73) triplet-triplet (singlet-singlet) band-heads\nderived from \\Marvel\\ experimental energies, 123 (38) of which have never been\nassigned in low or high resolution experiments. The highest $J$ value, where\n$J$ stands for the total angular momentum, for which an energy level is\nvalidated is 163. The number of experimentally-derived triplet and singlet\n\\TiO\\ rovibrational energy levels is 8682 and 1882, respectively. The lists of\nvalidated lines and levels for \\TiO\\ are deposited in the Supporting\nInformation to this paper.\n", "  We performed the calculation of the scattering length for the elastic\ncollision between the rubidium and cesium atoms. For this we applied a\nvariational procedure based on the R-matrix theory for unbound states employing\nthe finite element method (FEM) for expansion of the wave-function in terms of\na finite set of local basis functions. The FEM presents as advantages the\npossibility of the development of a efficient matrix inversion algorithm which\nsignificantly reduces the computation time to calculate the R matrix. We also\ntested a potential energy curve with spectroscopic accuracy obtained before\nfrom a direct adjustment procedure of experimental data of the\n$X^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ state based on genetic algorithm. The quality of our result\nwas evaluated by comparing them with several ones previously published at\nliterature.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in two transverse dimensions, relevant for the propagation of light in\ncertain exotic media. A well known feature of the model is the existence of\nflat-top bright solitons of fixed intensity, whose dynamics resembles the\nphysics of a liquid. They support traveling wave solutions, consisting of\nrarefaction pulses and vortex-antivortex pairs. In this work, we demonstrate\nhow the vortex-antivortex pairs can be generated in bright soliton collisions\ndisplaying destructive interference followed by a snake instability. We then\ndiscuss the collisional dynamics of the dark excitations for different initial\nconditions. We describe a number of distinct phenomena including vortex\nexchange modes, quasielastic flyby scattering, soliton-like crossing, fully\ninelastic collisions and rarefaction pulse merging.\n", "  Wave motion in two- and three-dimensional periodic lattices of beam members\nsupporting longitudinal and flexural waves is considered. An analytic method\nfor solving the Bloch wave spectrum is developed, characterized by a\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation obtained by enforcing the Floquet condition.\nThe dynamic stiffness matrix is shown to be explicitly Hermitian and to admit\npositive eigenvalues. Lattices with hexagonal, rectangular, tetrahedral and\ncubic unit cells are analyzed. The semi-analytical method can be asymptotically\nexpanded for low frequency yielding explicit forms for the Christoffel matrix\ndescribing wave motion in the quasistatic limit.\n", "  We present an upper bound for the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of quantum systems\nhaving a mixing quantum phase space. The method for this estimation is based on\nthe following ingredients: i) the graininess of quantum phase space in virtue\nof the Uncertainty Principle, ii) a time rescaled KS-entropy that introduces\nthe characteristic timescale as a parameter, and iii) the factorization\nproperty of the mixing correlations. The analogy between the structures of the\nmixing level of the ergodic hierarchy and of its quantum counterpart is shown.\nMoreover, the logarithmic timescale, characteristic of quantum chaotic systems,\nis obtained.\n", "  Broadband mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy applications could greatly\nbenefit from today's well-developed, highly scalable silicon photonics\ntechnology; however, this platform lacks broadband transparency due to its\nreliance on absorptive silicon dioxide cladding. Alternative cladding materials\nhave been studied, but the challenge lies in decreasing losses while avoiding\ncomplex fabrication techniques. Here, in contrast to traditional assumptions,\nwe show that silicon photonics can achieve low-loss propagation in the mid-IR\nfrom 3 - 6 um wavelength, thus providing a highly scalable, well-developed\ntechnology in this spectral range. We engineer the waveguide cross section and\noptical mode interaction with the absorptive cladding oxide to reduce loss at\nmid-IR wavelengths. We fabricate a microring resonator and measure an intrinsic\nquality (Q) factor of 10^6 at wavelengths from 3.5 to 3.8 um. This is the\nhighest Q demonstrated on an integrated mid-IR platform to date. With this\nhigh-Q silicon microresonator, we also demonstrate a low optical parametric\noscillation threshold of 5.2 mW, illustrating the utility of this platform for\nnonlinear chip-scale applications in the mid-IR.\n", "  The Beverloo's scaling for the gravity flow of granular materials through\norifices has two distinct universal features. On the one hand, much highlighted\nin the literature, the flow rate is independent of the height of the granular\ncolumn. On the other hand, less celebrated yet more striking, the flow rate is\nfairly insensitive to the material properties of the grains (density, Young's\nmodulus, friction coefficient, etc.). We show that both universal features are\nlost if work is done on the system at a high rate. In contrast with viscous\nfluids, the flow rate increases during discharge if a constant pressure is\napplied to the free surface of a granular column. Moreover, the flow rate\nbecomes sensitive to the material properties. Nevertheless, a new universal\nfeature emerges: the dissipated power scaled by the mean pressure and the flow\nrate follows a master curve for all conditions of forcing and material\nproperties studied. We show that this feature can be explained if the granular\nflow in the silo is assumed to be a quasistatic shear flow.\n", "  The possible origins of metal-bilayer graphene (BLG) contact resistance are\ninvestigated by taking into consideration the bandgap formed by interfacial\ncharge transfer at the metal contacts. Our results show that a charge injection\nbarrier (Schottky barrier) does not contribute to the contact resistance\nbecause the BLG under the contacts is always degenerately doped. We also showed\nthat the contact-doping-induced increase in the density of states (DOS) of BLG\nunder the metal contacts decreases the contact resistance owing to enhanced\ncharge carrier tunnelling at the contacts. The contact doping can be enhanced\nby inserting molecular dopant layers into the metal contacts. However, carrier\ntunnelling through the insertion layer increases the contact resistance, and\nthus, alternative device structures should be employed. Finally, we showed that\nthe inter-band transport by variable range hopping via in-gap states is the\nlargest contributor to contact resistance when the carrier type of the gated\nchannel is opposite to the contact doping carrier type. This indicates that the\nstrategy of contact resistance reduction by the contact-doping-induced increase\nin the DOS is effective only for a single channel transport branch (n- or\np-type) depending on the contact doping carrier type.\n", "  Recent technological advances in controlling materials have developed methods\nto produce idealized two-dimensional (2D) electron systems such as\nheterogeneous interfaces, molecular-beam-epitaxy (MBE) grown atomic layers,\nexfoliated thin flakes and field-effect devices. These 2D electron systems are\nhighly-crystalline with less disorder in common, some of which indeed show\nsheet resistance more than one order of magnitude lower even in atomic layers\nor single layers than that of conventional amorphous/granular thin films. Here,\nwe present a review on the recent developments of highly-crystalline 2D\nsuperconductors and a series of unprecedented physical properties discovered in\nthese systems. In particular, we highlight the quantum metallic state (or\npossible metallic ground state), the quantum Griffiths phase in out-of-plane\nmagnetic fields, and the superconducting state maintained in anomalously large\nin-plane magnetic fields, which were observed in exfoliated 2D materials,\nMBE-grown atomic-layer thin films and electric-double-layer (ion-gated)\ninterfaces. These phenomena are discussed on the basis of weakened disorder\nand/or broken spatial inversion symmetry. These novel aspects suggest that\nhighly-crystalline 2D systems are promising platforms for exploring new quantum\nphysics and superconductors.\n", "  We report the results of broadband (0.95--2.46 $\\mu$m) near-infrared\nspectroscopic observations of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Using a\nclump-finding algorithm in two-dimensional dispersed images, we identify 63\n\"knots\" from eight slit positions and derive their spectroscopic properties.\nAll of the knots emit [Fe II] lines together with other ionic forbidden lines\nof heavy elements, and some of them also emit H and He lines. We identify 46\nemission line features in total from the 63 knots and measure their fluxes and\nradial velocities. The results of our analyses of the emission line features\nbased on principal component analysis show that the knots can be classified\ninto three groups: (1) He-rich, (2) S-rich, and (3) Fe-rich knots. The He-rich\nknots have relatively small, $\\lesssim 200~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$, line-of-sight\nspeeds and radiate strong He I and [Fe II] lines resembling closely optical\nquasi-stationary flocculi of circumstellar medium, while the S-rich knots show\nstrong lines from O-burning material with large radial velocities up to $\\sim\n2000~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$ indicating that they are supernova ejecta material known\nas fast-moving knots. The Fe-rich knots also have large radial velocities but\nshow no lines from O-burning material. We discuss the origin of the Fe-rich\nknots and conclude that they are most likely \"pure\" Fe ejecta synthesized in\nthe innermost region during the supernova explosion. The comparison of [Fe II]\nimages with other waveband images shows that these dense Fe ejecta are mainly\ndistributed along the southwestern shell just outside the unshocked $^{44}$Ti\nin the interior, supporting the presence of unshocked Fe associated with\n$^{44}$Ti.\n", "  We report a precise measurement of hyperfine structure in the $ \\rm\n{3\\,S_{1/2}} $ state of the odd isotope of Li, namely $ \\rm {^7Li} $. The state\nis excited from the ground $ \\rm {2\\,S_{1/2}} $ state (which has the same\nparity) using two single-photon transitions via the intermediate $ \\rm\n{2\\,P_{3/2}} $ state. The value of the hyperfine constant we measure is $ A =\n93.095(52)$ MHz, which resolves two discrepant values reported in the\nliterature measured using other techniques. Our value is also consistent with\ntheoretical calculations.\n", "  An overview of the most recent measurements on top quark charge asymmetry in\ntop quark pair production is presented. The results are obtained using data\ncollected with ATLAS and CMS detectors in proton-proton collisions at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 8 TeV. In these studies, either dileptonic or\nsemileptonic top pair decays are analyzed. All measurements are comparable with\nthe standard model prediction and no sign of new physics is observed.\n", "  The \"free\" water surface is generally prone to contamination with surface\nimpurities be they surfactants, particles or other surface active agents. The\npresence of such impurities can modify flow boundary near such interfaces in a\ndrastic manner. Here we show that vibrating a small sphere mounted on an AFM\ncantilever near a gas bubble immersed in water, is an excellent probe of\nsurface contamination. Both viscous and elastic forces are exerted by an\nair-water interface on the vibrating sphere even when very low doses of\ncontaminants are present. The viscous drag forces show a cross-over from\nno-slip to slip boundary conditions while the elastic forces show a nontrivial\nvariation as the vibration frequency changes. We provide a simple model to\nrationalize these results and propose a simple way of evaluating the\nconcentration of such surface impurities.\n", "  Peculiarities of the defect modes of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) with\nan isotropic/anisotropic defect inside are investigated. The influence of the\ndefect layer thickness and its anisotropy of refraction, the influence of the\nsystem thickness and of the defect layer position in the system, as well as the\ninfluence of the dielectric borders on the defect modes is investigated. It is\nshown that it is possible to change reflection at the defect modes in wide\nintervals and change the defect mode wavelength, by tuning the defect location\nand its thickness. Such a system possesses transmission asymmetry. Also, the\nCLC system thickness and the refraction coefficient of the medium bordering the\nCLC layer on its both sides have essential influence on the reflection at the\ndefect mode and on the reflection frequency.\n", "  The coordinate-space wave function $\\psi(x)$ of quasi-one-dimensional atoms\nis defined in the $x\\geq 0$ region only. This poses a typical problem to write\na physically acceptable momentum-space wave function $\\phi(p)$ from the Fourier\ntransform of $\\psi(x)$. We resolve the problem with special attention to the\nbehavior of real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued function $\\phi(p)$\nas a function of $p$ and confirm that $\\phi_i(p)$ (the imaginary part of\n$\\phi(p)$) represents the correct momentum-space wave function. We make use of\nthe results for $\\psi(x)$ and $\\phi_i(p)$ to express the position- and\nmomentum-space Fisher information in terms of the principal quantum number and\nenergy eigen value of the system and provide some useful checks on the result\npresented with particular attention on the information theoretic uncertainty\nrelation.\n", "  We estimate the shear and the bulk viscous coefficients for a hot hadronic\ngas mixture constituting of pions and nucleons. The viscosities are evaluated\nin the relativistic kinetic theory approach by solving the transport equation\nin the relaxation time approximation for binary collisions ($\\pi\\pi$,$\\pi N$\nand $NN$). Instead of vacuum cross-sections usually used in the literature we\nemploy in-medium scattering amplitudes in the estimation of the relaxation\ntimes. The modified cross-sections for $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\pi N$ scattering are\nobtained using one-loop modified thermal propagators for $\\rho$, $\\sigma$ and\n$\\Delta$ in the scattering amplitudes which are calculated using effective\ninteractions. The resulting suppression of the cross sections at finite\ntemperature and baryon density is observed to significantly affect the $T$ and\n$\\mu_N$ dependence of the viscosities of the system.\n", "  We put forward a method for achieving fast and robust for magnetization\nreversal in a nanomagnet, by combining the inverse engineering and composite\npulses. The magnetic fields, generated by microwave with time-dependent\nfrequency, are first designed inversely within short operation time, and\ncomposite pulses are further incorporated to improve the fidelity through\nreducing the effect of magnetic anisotropy. The high-fidelity magnetization\nreversals are illustrated with numerical examples, and visualized on Bloch\nsphere. The influence of damping parameters, relevant to the pulse sequence, is\nfinally discussed based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilber equation. These results pave\nthe way for precise but fast magnetization reversal or switching, with the\napplications in high density information storage and processing.\n", "  Nowadays, a big part of people rely on available content in social media in\ntheir decisions (e.g. reviews and feedback on a topic or product). The\npossibility that anybody can leave a review provide a golden opportunity for\nspammers to write spam reviews about products and services for different\ninterests. Identifying these spammers and the spam content is a hot topic of\nresearch and although a considerable number of studies have been done recently\ntoward this end, but so far the methodologies put forth still barely detect\nspam reviews, and none of them show the importance of each extracted feature\ntype. In this study, we propose a novel framework, named NetSpam, which\nutilizes spam features for modeling review datasets as heterogeneous\ninformation networks to map spam detection procedure into a classification\nproblem in such networks. Using the importance of spam features help us to\nobtain better results in terms of different metrics experimented on real-world\nreview datasets from Yelp and Amazon websites. The results show that NetSpam\noutperforms the existing methods and among four categories of features;\nincluding review-behavioral, user-behavioral, reviewlinguistic,\nuser-linguistic, the first type of features performs better than the other\ncategories.\n", "  The criticism of the experiment showing disconnected traces of photons\npassing through a nested Mach-Zehnder interferometer is shown to be unfounded.\n", "  The Lounesto spinor classification is an important tool in fundamental\nphysics, because it makes explicit the pleiade of spinors types, beyond the\nused in quantum field theory (QFT). In this work, we show how the\nclassification emerges in two topics: first we show that the bilinear\ncovariants arise naturally in the equation of motion for a fermionic field in a\nRiemann-Cartan background (with gravitational dynamics f(R)) and we identify a\nsingular spinor field (a flag-dipole one) as a solution of the presented model.\nThis is the first solution flag-dipole founded in the literature. We\ninvestigated the behavior of the bilinear covariants in the context of the\ncalled standard model extension of Colladay and Kostelecky and we present\nexamples of transformations that violate the Lorentz symmetry, providing an\nextension of spinors classification, according to bilinear covariants, to\nscenarios with broken Lorentz symmetry. Finally, we proved that singular\nspinors of type flagpole are less susceptible to effects of Lorentz violation.\n", "  We have studied the neutron-capture reactions 8Li(n,gamma)9Li and its role in\nthe primordial nucleosynthesis. The n + 8Li --> 9Li + gamma reaction has a\nsignificant astrophysical interest because it includes one of the variants of\nchain of primordial nucleosynthesis processes of the Universe and thermonuclear\nreactions in type II supernova.\n", "  A special class of multicomponent NLS equations, generalizing the vector NLS\nand related to the {\\bf BD.I}-type symmetric are shown to be integrable through\nthe inverse scattering method (ISM). The corresponding fundamental analytic\nsolutions are constructing thus reducing the inverse scattering problem to a\nRiemann-Hilbert problem. We introduce the minimal sets of scattering data\n$\\mathfrak{T}$ which determines uniquely the scattering matrix and the\npotential $Q$ of the Lax operator. The elements of $\\mathfrak{T}$ can be viewed\nas the expansion coefficients of $Q$ over the `squared solutions' that are\nnatural generalizations of the standard exponentials. Thus we demonstrate that\nthe mapping $\\mathfrak{T} \\to Q$ is a generalized Fourier transform. Special\nattention is paid to two special representatives of this MNLS with\nthree-component and five components which describe spinor ($F=1$ and $F=2$,\nrespectively) Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  We study the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge when an active nematic film\nis topologically constraint. These topological constraints allow to control the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of the active system. We consider ellipsoidal shapes\nfor which the resulting defects are 1/2 disclinations and analyze the relation\nbetween their location and dynamics and local geometric properties of the\nellipsoid. We highlight two dynamic modes: a tunable periodic state that\noscillates between two defect configurations on a spherical shape and a tunable\nrotating state for oblate spheroids. We further demonstrate the relation\nbetween defects and high Gaussian curvature and umbilical points and point out\nlimits for a coarse-grained description of defects as self-propelled particles.\n", "  A liquid crystal optical device made of an optically anisotropic\nheterostructure is considered. The device consists of a cholesteric liquid\ncrystal (CLC) layer sandwiched by two phase-shifting anisotropic layers of a\nnematic liquid crystal (NLC). In this structure each of the NLC layers is a\nquarterwave plate. The problem is solved both by Ambartsumian method of layer\naddition and Muller matrix method. The peculiarities of reflection spectra,\neigen polarizations, rotation of polarization plane and polarization\nellipticity are studied. It is shown that this device can work as a light\nmodulator or a system for obtaining linearly polarized light with electrically\ntunable rotation of the polarization plane (which is especially important for\noptical communication), as well as a device for obtaining the linearly\npolarized light from a non-polarized one.\n", "  A nanofabrication process for realizing optical nanoantennas carved from a\nsingle-crystal gold plate is presented in this communication. The method relies\non synthesizing two-dimensional micron-size gold crystals followed by the dry\netching of a desired antenna layout. The fabrication of single-crystal optical\nnanoantennas with standard electron-beam lithography tool and dry etching\nreactor represents an alternative technological solution to focused ion beam\nmilling of the objects. The process is exemplified by engineering nanorod\nantennas. Dark-field spectroscopy indicates that optical antennas produced from\nsingle crystal flakes have reduced localized surface plasmon resonance losses\ncompared to amorphous designs of similar shape. The present process is easily\napplicable to other metals such as silver or copper and offers a design\nflexibility not found in crystalline particles synthesized by colloidal\nchemistry.\n", "  In physics there are two masses, the gravitational and inertial, and an open\nquestion: what is the relation between these two masses? The answer to that\nmust pass through the explanation of inertia. In the experiments that have been\nmade, it has been shown that the ratio of inertial mass to gravitational mass\nof an object is constant and equal for each material. This has led through the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity in responses which led to dramatic predictions\nconfirmed experimentally. In this paper we will follow a completely different\npath and will give different answers but our predictions will include earlier\npredictions that have been confirmed experimentally. Creating and using a\ntheory in a radically different way of thinking, which affects the whole of\nphysics, we will explain how the inertial forces are generated. In this process\nwe will define the physical quantity of inertial mass. The nature of inertial\nmass, the way it changes and the effect on the measurement of time, will show\nthat it is an extremely useful tool for the explanation of dark matter and dark\nenergy.\n", "  Refractory high entropy alloys containing elements from the Ti, V and Cr\ncolumns of the periodic table form body centered cubic (BCC) structures.\nElements from the Ti column are noteworthy because they take the BCC structure\nat high temperature but undergo a shear instability and transform to the\nhexagonal (HCP) structure at low temperature. We show that the instability of\nthese elements impacts the properties of the HEAs that contain them. In\nparticular, the shear moduli are greatly reduced, causing increased dynamic\ncontributions to lattice distortion. Relatively large size differences between\nelements of the BCC/HCP column compared with the regular BCC columns create\nadditional static contributions to lattice distortion. These findings are\nsupported by direct evaluation of elastic constants and lattice distortion in\nfour representative HEAs. Comparing moduli of HEAs with those of\ncompositionally averaged pure elements verifies the impact of BCC/HCP elements\nand allows us to estimate the compositions at which the BCC phases become\nelastically unstable, predictions that could be useful in material design.\n", "  We report on our studies of the renormalization of flavor singlet quark\nbilinear operators in lattice QCD. The renormalization constants are determined\nnon-perturbatively using gauge field ensembles with Nf=2 dynamical clover\nimproved fermions. The renormalization is performed in the RI'-MOM scheme. The\ndifference between flavor singlet and non-singlet quark bilinear operators is a\ndisconnected contribution, which has to be evaluated by stochastic estimators.\nWe compare our results for the running with perturbation theory.\n", "  We consider N trapped bosons in R 3 interacting via a pair potential w which\nhas a long range of dipolar type. We show the convergence of the energy and of\nthe minimizers for the many-body problem towards those of the dipolar\nGross-Pitaevskii functional, when N tends to infinity. In addition to the usual\ncubic interaction term, the latter has the long range dipolar interaction. Our\nresults hold under the assumption that the two-particle interaction is scaled\nin the form N 3$\\beta$--1 w(N $\\beta$ x) for some 0 $\\le$ $\\beta$ \\textless{}\n$\\beta$max with $\\beta$max = 1/3 + s/(45 + 42s) where s is related to the\ngrowth of the trapping potential.\n", "  In a 1+1 dimensional model of plane gravitational waves the flux-holonomy\nalgebra of loop quantum gravity is modified in such a way that the new basic\noperators satisfy canonical commutation relations. Thanks to this construction\nit is possible to find kinematical solutions for unidirectional plane\ngravitational waves with finite geometric expectation values and fluctuations,\nwhich was problematic in a more conventional approach in a foregoing paper by\nthe author and coauthors.\n", "  We analyze a gas of noninteracting fermions confined to a one-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator potential, with the aim of distinguishing between two\nproposed definitions of the thermodynamic entropy in the microcanonical\nensemble, namely the standard Boltzmann entropy and the Gibbs (or volume)\nentropy. The distinction between these two definitions is crucial for systems\nwith an upper bound on allowed energy levels, where the Boltzmann definition\ncan lead to the notion of negative absolute temperature. Although negative\ntemperatures do not exist for the system of fermions studied here, we still\nfind a significant difference between the Boltzmann and Gibbs entropies, and\nbetween the corresponding temperatures with the Gibbs temperature being closer\n(for small particle number) to the temperature based on a grand canonical\npicture.\n", "  The continuous packing of a flexible rod in two-dimensional cavities yields a\ncountable set of interacting domains that resembles non-equilibrium cellular\nsystems and belongs to a new class of light-weight material. However, the link\nbetween the length of the rod and the number of domains requires investigation\nespecially in the case of non-simply connected cavities, where the number of\navoided regions emulates an effective topological temperature. In the present\narticle we report the results of an experiment of injection of a single\nflexible rod into annular cavities in order to find the total length needed to\ninsert a given number of loops (domains of one vertex). Using an exponential\nmodel to describe the experimental data we quite minutely analyze the initial\nconditions, the intermediary behavior, and the tight-packing limit. This method\nallows the observation of a new fluctuation phenomenon associated with\ninstabilities in the dynamic evolution of the packing process. Furthermore, the\nfractal dimension of the global pattern enters the discussion under a novel\npoint of view. A comparison with the classical problems of the random close\npacking of disks, and jammed disk packings is made.\n", "  Undesired unintentional doping and doping limits in semiconductors are\ntypically caused by compensating defects with low formation energies. Since the\nformation energy of a charged defect depends linearly on the Fermi level,\ndoping limits can be especially pronounced in wide bandgap semiconductors where\nthe Fermi level can vary substantially. Introduction of non-equilibrium carrier\nconcentrations during growth or processing alters the chemical potentials of\nband carriers and thus provides the possibility of modifying populations of\ncharged defects in ways impossible at thermal equilibrium. Herein we\ndemonstrate that, for an ergodic system with excess carriers, the rates of\ncarrier capture and emission involving a defect charge transition level\nrigorously determine the admixture of electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels\ndetermining the formation energy of non-zero charge states of that defect type.\nTo catalog the range of possible responses to excess carriers, we investigate\nthe behavior of a single donor-like defect as functions of extrinsic doping and\nenergy of the charge transition level. The technologically most important\nfinding is that excess carriers will increase the formation energy of\ncompensating defects for most values of the charge transition level in the\nbandgap. Thus, it may be possible to overcome limitations on doping imposed by\nnative defects. Cases also exist in wide bandgap semiconductors in which the\nconcentration of defects with the same charge polarity as the majority dopant\nis either left unchanged or actually increases. The causes of these various\nbehaviors are rationalized in terms of the capture and emission rates and\nguidelines for carrying out experimental tests of this model are given.\n", "  The Zika virus has been found in individual cases but has not been confirmed\nas the cause of in the large number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in\n2015-6. Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly\nacross geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here\nwe consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking\nwater might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile\nhormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat\nsoluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin\nA, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development\nhas been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone\nanalog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause\ndevelopmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing\nmicrocephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.\nWe review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually\nfound some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and\narhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is\nunprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.\nClaims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not\nbeen documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly\ncases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different\nstates across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim\nthat Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular\nmechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend\nthat the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal\nlink to microcephaly is investigated further.\n", "  In this pedagogical paper a coherent explanation of the resting potential of\nnerve cells is given in terms of its determining factors. These are the\ncurrents of active transport of the ions to which the membrane is permeable,\ntheir membrane permeabilities and their concentrations in the extracellular\nfluid. They play the role of the independent variables in the problem and\nsimultaneously also determine the concentrations of the permeating ions inside\nthe cell. The resting state is assumed to be a stationary state, and the\nresting potential is understood to be the membrane potential in this state. The\nexplanation presented here differs from the conventional one found in textbooks\nwith respect to the handling of the intracellular concentrations of the\npermeant ions. In the conventional description the causal relations between\nthese and the independent variables are not taken into account, and the\nintracellular concentrations are treated like additional independent variables.\nThe \"causal\" theory presented here leads to a simple formula for the resting\npotential in terms of the currents of active transport (pumping by the\nNa,K-pump and carrier transport) and the membrane permeabilities for sodium and\npotassium ions. In addition it leads to two results not obtained in the\nconventional treatment: An upper bound exists for the magnitude of the resting\npotential, and the difference between the resting potential and the diffusion\npotential, which can be measured after poisoning of the ion pumps, is small.\n", "  Black phosphorus is emerging as a promising semiconductor for electronic and\noptoelectronic applications. To study fundamental carrier properties, we\nperformed ultrafast femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy on thin film black\nphosphorus mechanically exfoliated on a glass substrate. Carriers (electrons\nand holes) were excited to high energy levels and the process of carrier\nrelaxation through phonon emission and recombination was probed. We used a wide\nrange of probing wavelengths up to and across the band gap to study the\nevolution of the relaxation dynamics at different energy levels. Our\nexperiments revealed a plethora of important physical phenomena. The fast\nrelaxation time constants, associated with carrier-phonon scattering, steadily\nincrease as the energy of the probe beam approaches the band gap energy, which\nwas determined to be 0.31 eV, and the carrier recombination rate was obtained\nwhen the probe wavelength was tuned to match the band gap energy. The\ncarrier-phonon scattering rates were found to be similar along the armchair and\nzigzag directions, therefore, the anisotropic carrier mobility reported in\nliterature is mainly due to the difference in effective mass of carriers along\ndifferent directions. The ultrafast spectroscopy data further revealed the\noxidation induced surface charges. Our results highlight the importance of\nusing the spectroscopy technique, in this case, in the mid-IR range, to uncover\nuseful physical processes.\n", "  Recently, a new two-dimensional carbon allotrope called pentagraphene (PG)\nwas proposed. PG exhibits mechanical and electronic interesting properties,\nincluding typical band gap values of semiconducting materials. PG has a\nCairo-tiling-like 2D lattice of non coplanar pentagons and its mechanical\nproperties have not been yet fully investigated. In this work, we combined\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations and reactive molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations to investigate the mechanical properties and fracture patterns\nof PG membranes under tensile strain. We show that PG membranes can hold up to\n20% of strain and that fracture occurs only after substantial dynamical bond\nbreaking and the formation of 7, 8 and 11 carbon rings and carbon chains. The\nstress-strain behavior was observed to follow two regimes, one exhibiting\nlinear elasticity followed by a plastic one, involving carbon atom\nre-hybridization with the formation of carbon rings and chains. Our results\nalso show that mechanically induced structural transitions from PG to graphene\nis unlikely to occur, in contrast to what was previously speculated in the\nliterature.\n"]}
