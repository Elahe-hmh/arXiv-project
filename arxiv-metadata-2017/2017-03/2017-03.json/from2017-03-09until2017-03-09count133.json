Using a\nspecial choice of the parameters, it is shown that the associator of the\nproduct of four supersymmetry generators is connected with the angular momentum\noperator. The connection of operator decomposition to the hidden variables\ntheory and alternative quantum mechanics is discussed.\n", "  In the sixties Ogievetskii and Polubarinov proposed the concept of a notoph,\nwhose helicity properties are complementary to those of a photon. Later, Kalb\nand Ramond (and others) developed this theoretical concept. And, at the present\ntimes it is widely accepted. We analyze the quantum theory of antisymmetric\ntensor fields with taking into account mass dimensions of notoph and photon. It\nappears to be possible to describe both photon and notoph degrees of freedom on\nthe basis of the modified Bargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric\nsecond-rank spinor. Next, we proceed to derive equations for the symmetric\ntensor of the second rank on the basis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a\nstraightforward way. The symmetric multispinor of the fourth rank is used. It\nis constructed out of the Dirac 4-spinors. Due to serious problems with the\ninterpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure we\ngeneralize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which are\nconsistent with the general relativity. The importance of the 4-vector field\n(and its gauge part) is pointed out. Thus, we present the full theory which\ncontains photon, notoph (the Kalb-Ramond field) and the graviton. The relations\nof this theory with the higher spin theories are established. In fact, we\ndeduced the gravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics.\nWe estimate possible interactions, fermion-notoph, graviton-notoph,\nphoton-notoph.

We study the scaling of the\noptical noise across hundreds of nanometers of optical spectra. We measure the\nresidual phase noise between two OFC's (having offset frequencies $f^{(1)}_0 $\nand $f^{(2)}_0$) referenced to a common cavity-stabilized narrow linewidth CW\nlaser. Their relative offset frequency $ \\Delta f_0 = f^{(2)}_0 - f^{(1)}_0 $,\nwhich appears across their entire spectra, provides a convenient measure of the\nphase noise. By comparing $\\Delta f_0$ at different spectral regions, we\ndemonstrate that the observed scaling of the residual phase noise is in very\ngood agreement with the noise predicted from the standard frequency comb\nequation.\n", "  This note is to bring to the reader's attention the fact that general\nrelativity and quantum mechanics differ from each other in one main aspect.\nGeneral relativity is based on the diffeomorphism covariant formulation of the\nlaws of physics while quantum mechanics is constructed such that its\nfundamental laws remain invariant to a change of topology. It is the goal of\nthis paper to show that in order to obtain a complete description of quantum\ngravity one has to extend the principle of diffeomorphism invariance from\ngeneral relativity in the sense of quantum mechanics i.e. the laws of physics\nmust be covariant to a change in the topology of spacetime. On the practical\nside, I provide an answer to the black hole information paradox: the missing\ninformation is permanently encoded in the higher cohomology of the quantum\nfield space allowed by the given situation. Notions like entanglement become\ndependent on choices of coefficients in cohomology. There remains still an\nuncertainty principle, namely the one given by the incompatibility of various\nchoices of coefficients required for the construction of the cohomology. In\nthis way the answer to the unitarity problem appears to be : indeed, unitarity\nis restored, as required by standard quantum mechanics but one still needs an\nextended uncertainty principle (envisioned already by Hawking) which has an\nexact formulation in the universal coefficient theorem.\n", "  The ability to filter unwanted light signals is critical to the operation of\nquantum memories based on neutral atom ensembles. Here we demonstrate an\nefficient frequency filter which uses a vapor cell filled with $^{85}$Rb and a\nbuffer gas to attenuate both residual laser light and noise photons by nearly\ntwo orders of magnitude with little loss to the single photons associated with\nour cold $^{87}$Rb quantum memory. This simple, passive filter provides an\nadditional 18 dB attenuation of our pump laser and erroneous spontaneous\nemissions for every 1 dB loss of the single photon signal. We show that the\naddition of a frequency filter increases the non-classical correlations and\nreadout efficiency of our quantum memory by $\\approx35\\%$.\n", "  We develop a combinatorial approach to the construction of general smooth\ncompact base surfaces that support elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. This extends\nprevious analyses that have relied on toric or semi-toric structure. The\nresulting algorithm is used to construct all classes of such base surfaces $S$\nwith $h^{1, 1} (S) < 8$ and all base surfaces over which there is an\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ with Hodge number $h^{2, 1} (X)\n\\geq 150$. These two sets can be used todescribe all 6D F-theory models that\nhave fewer than seven tensor multiplets or more than 150 neutral scalar fields\nrespectively in their maximally Higgsed phase. Technical challenges to\nconstructing the complete list of base surfaces for all Hodge numbers are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The fidelity function of quantum states have been widely used in quantum\ninformation science and frequently arises in the quantification of optimal\nperformances for the estimation and distinguish of quantum states. A fidelity\nfunction on quantum channel is expected to have same wide applications in\nquantum information science. In this paper we propose a fidelity function on\nquantum channels and show that various distance measures on quantum channels\ncan be obtained from this fidelity function, for example the Bures angle and\nthe Bures distance can be extended to quantum channels via this fidelity\nfunction. We then show that the distances between quantum channels lead\nnaturally to a new Fisher information which quantifies the ultimate precision\nlimit in quantum metrology, the ultimate precision limit can thus be seen as a\nmanifestation of the distances between quantum channels. We also show that the\nfidelity on quantum channels provides a unified framework for perfect quantum\nchannel discrimination and quantum metrology, in particular we show that the\nminimum number of uses needed for perfect channel discrimination is exactly the\ncounterpart of the precision limit in quantum metrology, and various useful\nlower bounds for the minimum number of uses needed for perfect channel\ndiscrimination can be obtained via this connection.\n", "  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a NASA-sponsored Explorer\nmission that will perform a wide-field survey for planets that transit bright\nhost stars. Here, we predict the properties of the transiting planets that TESS\nwill detect along with the eclipsing binary stars that produce false-positive\nphotometric signals. The predictions are based on Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe nearby population of stars, occurrence rates of planets derived from\nKepler, and models for the photometric performance and sky coverage of the TESS\ncameras. We expect that TESS will find approximately 1700 transiting planets\nfrom 200,000 pre-selected target stars. This includes 556 planets smaller than\ntwice the size of Earth, of which 419 are hosted by M dwarf stars and 137 are\nhosted by FGK dwarfs. Approximately 130 of the $R < 2~R_\\oplus$ planets will\nhave host stars brighter than K = 9. Approximately 48 of the planets with $R <\n2~R_\\oplus$ lie within or near the habitable zone ($0.2 < S/S_\\oplus < 2$), and\nbetween 2-7 such planets have host stars brighter than K = 9. We also expect\napproximately 1100 detections of planets with radii 2-4 R_Earth, and 67 planets\nlarger than $4~R_\\oplus$. Additional planets larger than $2~R_\\oplus$ can be\ndetected around stars that are not among the pre-selected target stars, because\nTESS will also deliver full-frame images at a 30-minute cadence. The planet\ndetections are accompanied by over one thousand astrophysical false positives.\nWe discuss how TESS data and ground-based observations can be used to\ndistinguish the false positives from genuine planets. We also discuss the\nprospects for follow-up observations to measure the masses and atmospheres of\nthe TESS planets.\n", "  A significant accumulation of matter in solid Helium-4 observed during the\nsuperflow events, dubbed as the giant isochoric compressibility (or the syringe\neffect), is discussed within the model of dislocations with superfluid core. It\nis shown that solid Helium-4 in a contact with superfluid reservoir can develop\na bistability with respect to the syringe fraction, with the threshold for the\nbias by chemical potential determined by a typical free length of dislocations\nwith superfluid core. The main implications of this effect are: hysteresis and\nstrongly non-linear dynamical behavior leading to growth, proliferation and\npossibly exiting from a crystal of superclimbing dislocations. Three major\nchannels for such dynamics are identified: i) injection and inflation of the\nprismatic loops from the boundary; ii) Bardeed-Herring generation of the loops\nin the bulk; iii) helical instability of the screw dislocations. It is argued\nthat the current experiments are likely to be well in this regime. Several\ntestable predictions for the time and the bias dependencies of the dynamics are\nsuggested\n", "  Recent developments in gravitation theory indicate that the classic general\nrelativity is an effective macroscopic theory which will be eventually replaced\nwith a more fundamental theory based on thermodynamics of yet unknown\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom. Here we consider thermodynamics of an effective\nMinkowski spacetime which may be formed under the influence of external\nmagnetic field in a cobalt ferrofluid. It appears that the extraordinary\nphotons propagating inside the ferrofluid perceive thermal gradients in the\nferrofluid as an effective gravitational field, which obeys the Newton law.\nMoreover, the effective Minkowski spacetime behaviour near the metric signature\ntransition may mimic various cosmological Big Bang scenarios, which may be\nvisualized directly using an optical microscope. Thus, some important features\nof the hypothetic microscopic theory of gravity are reproduced in the\nferrofluid-based analogue model.\n", "  A twist is a datum playing a role of a local system for topological\n$K$-theory. In equivariant setting, twists are classified into four types\naccording to how they are realized geometrically. This paper lists the possible\ntypes of twists for the torus with the actions of the point groups of all the\n2-dimensional space groups (crystallographic groups), or equivalently, the\ntorus with the actions of all the possible finite subgroups in its mapping\nclass group. This is carried out by computing Borel's equivariant cohomology\nand the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. As a byproduct, the equivariant\ncohomology up to degree three is determined in all cases. The equivariant\ncohomology with certain local coefficients is also considered in relation to\nthe twists of the Freed-Moore $K$-theory.\n", "  After the LHC Run 1, the standard model (SM) of particle physics has been\ncompleted. Yet, despite its successes, the SM has shortcomings vis-\\`{a}-vis\ncosmological and other observations. At the same time, while the LHC restarts\nfor Run 2 at 13 TeV, there is presently a lack of direct evidence for new\nphysics phenomena at the accelerator energy frontier. From this state of\naffairs arises the need for a consistent theoretical framework in which\ndeviations from the SM predictions can be calculated and compared to precision\nmeasurements. Such a framework should be able to comprehensively make use of\nall measurements in all sectors of particle physics, including LHC Higgs\nmeasurements, past electroweak precision data, electric dipole moment, $g-2$,\npenguins and flavor physics, neutrino scattering, deep inelastic scattering,\nlow-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ scattering, mass measurements, and any search for\nphysics beyond the SM. By simultaneously describing all existing measurements,\nthis framework then becomes an intermediate step, pointing us toward the next\nSM, and hopefully revealing the underlying symmetries. We review the role that\nthe standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) could play in this context,\nas a consistent, complete, and calculable generalization of the SM in the\nabsence of light new physics. We discuss the relationship of the SMEFT with the\nexisting kappa-framework for Higgs boson couplings characterization and the use\nof pseudo-observables, that insulate experimental results from refinements due\nto ever-improving calculations. The LHC context, as well as that of previous\nand future accelerators and experiments, is also addressed.\n", "  We consider a kinetic model, which describes the sedimentation of rod-like\nparticles in dilute suspensions under the influence of gravity. This model has\nrecently been derived by Helzel and Tzavaras in \\cite{HT2015}. Here we restrict\nour considerations to shear flow and consider a simplified situation, where the\nparticle orientation is restricted to the plane spanned by the direction of\nshear and the direction of gravity. For this simplified kinetic model we carry\nout a linear stability analysis and we derive two different macroscopic models\nwhich describe the formation of clusters of higher particle density. One of\nthese macroscopic models is based on a diffusive scaling, the other one is\nbased on a so-called quasi-dynamic approximation. Numerical computations, which\ncompare the predictions of the macroscopic models with the kinetic model,\ncomplete our presentation.\n", "  Recent developments make the possibility of achieving scalable quantum\nnetworks and quantum devices closer. From the computational point of view these\nemerging technologies become relevant when they are no longer classically\nsimulatable. Hence a pressing challenge is the construction of practical\nmethods to verify the correctness of the outcome produced by universal or\nnon-universal quantum devices. A promising approach that has been extensively\nexplored is the scheme of verification via encryption through blind quantum\ncomputing initiated by Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We present here a new\nconstruction that simplifies the required resources for any such verifiable\nblind quantum computating protocol. We obtain an overhead that is linear in the\nsize of the input, while the security parameter remains independent of the size\nof the computation and can be made exponentially small. Furthermore our\nconstruction is generic and could be applied to any non-universal scheme with a\ngiven underlying graph.\n", "  Recently, several discussions on the possible observability of 4-vector\nfields have been published in literature. Furthermore, several authors recently\nclaimed existence of the helicity=0 fundamental field. We re-examine the theory\nof antisymmetric tensor fields and 4-vector potentials. We study the massless\nlimits. In fact, a theoretical motivation for this venture is the old papers of\nOgievetskii and Polubarinov, Hayashi, and Kalb and Ramond. They proposed the\nconcept of the notoph, whose helicity properties are complementary to those of\nthe photon. We analyze the quantum field theory with taking into account mass\ndimensions of the notoph and the photon. It appears to be possible to describe\nboth photon and notoph degrees of freedom on the basis of the modified\nBargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric second-rank spinor. Next, we\nproceed to derive equations for the symmetric tensor of the second rank on the\nbasis of the Bargmann-Wigner formalism in a straightforward way. The symmetric\nmultispinor of the fourth rank is used. Due to serious problems with the\ninterpretation of the results obtained on using the standard procedure we\ngeneralize it and obtain the spin-2 relativistic equations, which are\nconsistent with the general relativity. Thus, in fact we deduced the\ngravitational field equations from relativistic quantum mechanics. The\nrelations of this theory with the scalar-tensor theories of gravitation and\nf(R) are discussed. Particular attention has been paid to the correct\ndefinitions of the energy-momentum tensor and other Noether currents in the\nelectromagnetic theory, the relativistic theory of gravitation, the general\nrelativity, and their generalizations. We estimate possible interactions,\nfermion-notoph, graviton-notoph, photon-notoph, and we conclude that they can\nprobably be seen in experiments in the next few years.\n", "  We introduce a class of digital machines we name Digital Memcomputing\nMachines (DMMs) able to solve a wide range of problems including\nNon-deterministic Polynomial (NP) ones with polynomial resources (in time,\nspace and energy). An abstract DMM with this power must satisfy a set of\ncompatible mathematical constraints underlying its practical realization. We\ninitially prove this by introducing the complexity classes for these machines.\nWe then make a connection with dynamical systems theory. This leads to the set\nof physical constraints for poly-resource resolvability. Once the mathematical\nrequirements have been assessed, we propose a practical scheme to solve the\nabove class of problems based on the novel concept of self-organizing logic\ngates and circuits (SOLCs). These are logic gates and circuits able to accept\ninput signals from any terminal, without distinction between conventional input\nand output terminals. They can solve boolean problems by self-organizing into\ntheir solution. They can be fabricated either with circuit elements with memory\n(such as memristors) and/or standard MOS technology. Using tools of functional\nanalysis, we prove mathematically the following constraints for the\npoly-resource resolvability: i) SOLCs possess a global attractor; ii) their\nonly equilibrium points are the solutions of the problems to solve; iii) the\nsystem converges exponentially fast to the solutions; iv) the equilibrium\nconvergence rate scales at most polynomially with input size. We finally\nprovide arguments that periodic orbits and strange attractors cannot coexist\nwith equilibria. As examples we show how to solve the prime factorization and\nthe NP-hard version of the subset-sum problem. Since DMMs map integers into\nintegers they are robust against noise, and hence scalable. We finally discuss\nthe implications of the DMM realization through SOLCs to the NP=P question\nrelated to...\n", "  Cells move differently on substrates with different elasticities. In\nparticular, the persistence time of their motion is higher on stiffer\nsubstrates. We show that this behavior will result in a net transport of cells\ndirected up a soft-to-stiff gradient. Using simple random walk models with\ncontrolled persistence and stochastic simulations, we characterize this\npropensity to move in terms of the durotactic index measured in experiments. A\none-dimensional model captures the essential features of this motion and\nhighlights the competition between diffusive spreading and linear, wavelike\npropagation. Since the directed motion is rooted in a non-directional change in\nthe behavior of individual cells, the motility is a kinesis rather than a\ntaxis. Persistence-driven durokinesis is generic and may be of use in the\ndesign of instructive environments for cells and other motile, mechanosensitive\nobjects.\n", "  We extend the chameleon models by considering Scalar-Fluid theories where the\ncoupling between matter and the scalar field can be represented by a quadratic\neffective potential with density-dependent minimum and mass. In this context,\nwe study the effects of the scalar field on Solar System tests of gravity and\nshow that models passing these stringent constraints can still induce large\nmodifications of Newton's law on galactic scales. On these scales we analyse\nmodels which could lead to a percent deviation of Newton's law outside the\nvirial radius. We then model the dark matter halo as a Navarro-Frenk-White\nprofile and explicitly find that the fifth force can give large contributions\naround the galactic core in a particular model where the scalar field mass is\nconstant and the minimum of its potential varies linearly with the matter\ndensity. At cosmological distances, we find that this model does not alter the\ngrowth of large scale structures and therefore would be best tested on galactic\nscales, where interesting signatures might arise in the galaxy rotation curves.\n", "  In this paper we show that the dramatic increase in the number of research\narticles indexed in the Web of Science database impacts the commonly observed\ndistributions of citations within these articles. First, we document that the\ngrowing number of physics articles in recent years is due to existing journals\npublishing more and more papers rather than more new journals coming into being\nas it happens in computer science. And second, even though the references from\nthe more recent papers generally cover a longer time span, the newer papers are\ncited more frequently than the older ones if the uneven paper growth is not\ncorrected for. Nevertheless, despite this change in the distribution of\ncitations, the citation behavior of scientists does not seem to have changed.\n", "  Statistical mechanics has proven to be able to capture the fundamental rules\nunderlying phenomena of social aggregation and opinion dynamics, well studied\nin disciplines like sociology and psychology. This approach is based on the\nunderlying paradigm that the interesting dynamics of multi-agent systems emerge\nfrom the correct definition of few parameters governing the evolution of each\nindividual. Into this context, we propose a particular model of opinion\ndynamics based on the psychological construct named \"cognitive dissonance\". Our\nsystem is made of interacting individuals, the agents, each bearing only two\ndynamical variables (respectively \"opinion\" and \"affinity\") self-consistently\nadjusted during time evolution. We also define two special classes of\ninteracting entities, both acting for a peace mediation process but via\ndifferent course of action: \"diplomats\" and \"auctoritates\". The behavior of the\nsystem with and without peace mediators (PMs) is investigated and discussed\nwith reference to corresponding psychological and social implications.\n", "  An analytical solution based on the Laplace transformation technique for the\nDGLAP evolution equations is presented at next-to-leading order accuracy in\nperturbative QCD. This technique is also applied to extract the analytical\nsolution for the proton structure function, $F_2^p(x, Q^2)$, in the Laplace\n$s$-space. We present the results for the separate parton distributions for all\nparton species, including valence quark densities, the anti-quark and strange\nsea parton distribution functions (PDFs), and the gluon distribution. We\nsuccessfully compare the obtained parton distribution functions and the proton\nstructure function with the results from {\\tt GJR08} and {\\tt KKT12}\nparametrization models as well as the $x$-space results using {\\tt QCDnum}\ncode. Our calculations show a very good agreement with the available\ntheoretical models as well as the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experimental\ndata throughout the small and large values of $x$. The use of our analytical\nsolution to extract the parton densities and the proton structure function is\ndiscussed in detail to justify the analysis method considering the accuracy and\nspeed of calculations. Overall, the accuracy we obtain from the analytical\nsolution using the inverse Laplace transform technique is found to be better\nthan 1 part in 10$^{4}$ to 10$^{5}$. We also present a detailed QCD analysis of\nnon-singlet structure functions using all available DIS data to perform global\nQCD fits. In this regard we employ the Jacobi polynomial approach to convert\nthe results from Laplace $s$ space to Bjorken $x$ space. The extracted valence\nquark densities are also presented and compared to the {\\tt JR14}, {\\tt\nMMHT14}, {\\tt NNPDF} and {\\tt CJ15} PDFs sets. We evaluate the numerical\neffects of target mass corrections (TMCs) and higher twist (HT) terms on\nvarious structure functions, and compare fits to data with and without these\ncorrections.\n", "  We investigate the capability of various configurations of the space\ninterferometer eLISA to probe the late-time background expansion of the\nuniverse using gravitational wave standard sirens. We simulate catalogues of\nstandard sirens composed by massive black hole binaries whose gravitational\nradiation is detectable by eLISA, and which are likely to produce an\nelectromagnetic counterpart observable by future surveys. The main issue for\nthe identification of a counterpart resides in the capability of obtaining an\naccurate enough sky localisation with eLISA. This seriously challenges the\ncapability of four-link (2 arm) configurations to successfully constrain the\ncosmological parameters. Conversely, six-link (3 arm) configurations have the\npotential to provide a test of the expansion of the universe up to $z\\sim 8$\nwhich is complementary to other cosmological probes based on electromagnetic\nobservations only. In particular, in the most favourable scenarios, they can\nprovide a significant constraint on $H_0$ at the level of 0.5%. Furthermore,\n$(\\Omega_M, \\Omega_\\Lambda)$ can be constrained to a level competitive with\npresent SNIa results. On the other hand, the lack of massive black hole binary\nstandard sirens at low redshift allows to constrain dark energy only at the\nlevel of few percent.\n", "  While the discovery of Dirac and Weyl type excitations in electronic systems\nis a major breakthrough in recent condensed matter physics, finding appropriate\nmaterials for fundamental physics and technological applications, is an\nexperimental challenge. In all the reported materials, linear dispersion\nsurvives only up to a few hundred meV from the Dirac or Weyl nodes. On the\nother hand, real materials are subject to uncontrolled doping during\npreparation and thermal effect near room temperature can hinder the rich\nphysics. In ZrSiS, ARPES measurements have shown an unusually robust linear\ndispersion (up to $\\sim$2 eV) with multiple non-degenerate Dirac nodes. In this\ncontext, we present the magnetotransport study on ZrSiS crystal, which\nrepresents a large family of materials (\\textit{WHM} with \\textit{W} = Zr, Hf;\n\\textit{H} = Si, Ge, Sn; \\textit{M} = O, S, Se, Te) with identical band\ntopology. Along with extremely large and non-saturating magnetoresistance (MR),\n$\\sim$ 1.4 $\\times$ 10$^{5}$ \\% at 2 K and 9 T, it shows strong anisotropy\ndepending on the direction of the magnetic field. Quantum oscillation and Hall\neffect measurements have revealed large hole and small electron Fermi pockets.\nNon-trivial $\\pi$ Berry phase confirms the Dirac fermionic nature for both\ntypes of charge carriers. The long-sought relativistic phenomenon of massless\nDirac fermions, known as Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly, has also been\nobserved.\n", "  The next Galactic supernova is expected to bring great opportunities for the\ndirect detection of gravitational waves (GW), full flavor neutrinos, and\nmulti-wavelength photons. To maximize the science return from such a rare\nevent, it is essential to have established classes of possible situations and\npreparations for appropriate observations. To this end, we use a long-term\nnumerical simulation of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) of a 17 solar-mass\nred supergiant progenitor to self-consistently model the multi-messenger\nsignals expected in GW, neutrino, and electromagnetic messengers. This\nsupernova model takes into account the formation and evolution of a\nprotoneutron star, neutrino-matter interaction, and neutrino transport, all\nwithin a two-dimensional shock hydrodynamics simulation. With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information. We explore how these in turn deliver\nan improvement in the sensitivity of GW analyses and help to guarantee\nobservations of early electromagnetic signals. To facilitate the detection of\nmulti-messenger signals of CCSNe in extremely nearby and extragalactic\ndistances, we compile a list of nearby red supergiant candidates and a list of\nnearby galaxies with their expected CCSN rates. By exploring the sequential\nmulti-messenger signals of a nearby CCSN, we discuss preparations for\nmaximizing successful studies of such an unprecedented stirring event.\n", "  We expand the dynamical systems investigation of cosmological scalar fields\ncharacterised by kinetic corrections presented in [N. Tamanini, Phys. Rev. D 89\n(2014) 083521]. In particular we do not restrict the analysis to exponential\npotentials only, but we consider arbitrary scalar field potentials and derive\ngeneral results regarding the corresponding cosmological dynamics. Two specific\npotentials are then used as examples to show how these models can be employed\nnot only to describe dark energy, but also to achieve dynamical crossing of the\nphantom barrier at late times. Stability and viability issues at the classical\nlevel are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological dynamics of the recently proposed extended\nchameleon models at both background and linear perturbation levels. Dynamical\nsystems techniques are employed to fully characterize the evolution of the\nuniverse at the largest distances, while structure formation is analysed at\nsub-horizon scales within the quasi-static approximation. The late time\ndynamical transition from dark matter to dark energy domination can be well\ndescribed by almost all extended chameleon models considered, with no\ndeviations from $\\Lambda$CDM results at both background and perturbation\nlevels. The results obtained in this work confirm the cosmological viability of\nextended chameleons as alternative dark energy models.\n", "  Everett's Relative State Interpretation (aka Many Worlds Interpretation) has\ngained increasing interest due to the progress understanding the role of\ndecoherence. In order to fulfill its promise as an intellectually economic\nrealistic description of the physical world, two postulates are formulated. In\nshort they are 1) for a system with continuous coordinates $\\mathbf x$,\ndiscrete variable $j$, and state $\\psi_j(\\mathbf x)$, the density\n$\\rho_j(x)=|\\psi_j(x)|^2$ gives the distribution of the location of the system\nwith the respect to the variables $x$ and $j$; 2) an equation of motion for the\nstate $i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi = H\\psi$. The contents of the standard\n(Copenhagen) postulates are derived including the quantum probabilities (Born's\nrule).\n", "  Observed efficiencies of industrial power plants are often approximated by\nthe square-root formula: $1-\\sqrt{T_-/T_+}$, where $T_+ (T_-)$ is the highest\n(lowest) temperature achieved in the plant. This expression can be derived\nwithin finite-time thermodynamics, or, by entropy generation minimization,\nbased on finite rates of processes. A closely related quantity is the optimal\nvalue of the intermediate temperature for the hot stream, which is given by the\ngeometric-mean value: $\\sqrt{T_+ T_-}$. It is proposed to model the operation\nof plants by quasi-static work extraction models, with one reservoir\n(source/sink) as finite, while the other as practically infinite. No\nsimplifying assumption is made on the nature of the finite system. This\ndescription is consistent with two model hypotheses, each yielding a specific\nvalue of the intermediate temperature. We show that the expected value of the\nintermediate temperature, defined as the arithmetic mean, is very closely given\nby the geometric-mean value. The definition is motivated as the use of\ninductive inference in the presence of limited information.\n", "  Studies report that firms do not invest in cost-effective green technologies.\nWhile economic barriers can explain parts of the gap, behavioural aspects cause\nfurther under-valuation. This could be partly due to systematic deviations of\ndecision-making agents' perceptions from normative benchmarks, and partly due\nto their diversity. This paper combines available behavioural knowledge into a\nsimple model of technology adoption. Firms are modelled as heterogeneous agents\nwith different behavioural responses. To quantify the gap, the model simulates\ntheir investment decisions from different theoretical perspectives. While\nrelevant parameters are uncertain at the micro-level, using distributed agent\nperspectives provides a realistic representation of the macro adoption rate.\nThe model is calibrated using audit data for proposed investments in energy\nefficient electric motors. The inclusion of behavioural factors reduces\nsignificantly expected adoption rates: from 81% using a normative optimisation\nperspective, down to 20% using a behavioural perspective. The effectiveness of\nvarious policies is tested.\n", "  We analyse the proposal of sliding phases (SP) in layers hosting global U(1)\nsymmetric variables with finite inter-layer Josephson coupling. Based on the\nKosterlitz-Thouless renormalization group (RG) approach, such phases were\npredicted to exist in various layered (or 1D quantum coupled) systems. The key\nin the RG argument is treating the coupling as though the variables are\nnon-compact. Large scale Monte Carlo simulations of a layered model, where the\nSP is supposed to exist, finds no indication of such a phase. Instead, 3D\nbehavior is observed. This result is consistent with the asymptotically exact\nanalytical solution. A generic argument against SP in translationally invariant\nsystems with short range interactions is provided. We have also suggested an\nalternative model for the SP -- adding long-range interactions to the\ninter-layer Josephson term.\n", "  We discuss how to formulate a quantum field theory of dark energy interacting\nwith dark matter. We show that the proposals based on the assumption that dark\nmatter is made up of heavy particles with masses which are very sensitive to\nthe value of dark energy are strongly constrained. Quintessence-generated long\nrange forces and radiative stability of the quintessence potential require that\nsuch dark matter and dark energy are completely decoupled. However, if dark\nenergy and a fraction of dark matter are very light axions, they can have\nsignificant mixings which are radiatively stable and perfectly consistent with\nquantum field theory. Such models can naturally occur in multi-axion\nrealizations of monodromies. The mixings yield interesting signatures which are\nobservable and are within current cosmological limits but could be constrained\nfurther by future observations.\n", "  We revisit the sensitivity study of the Tokai-to-Kamioka-and-Korea (T2KK) and\nTokai-to-Kamioka-and-Oki (T2KO) proposals where a water Cerenkov detector with\nthe 100 kton fiducial volume is placed in Korea ($L = 1000$ km) and Oki island\n($L = 653$ km) in Japan, respectively, in addition to the Super-Kamiokande for\ndetermination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and leptonic CP phase\n($\\delta_{CP}$). We systematically study the running ratio of the $\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ focusing beams with dedicated background estimation for the\n$\\nu_e$ appearance and $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance signals, especially improving\ntreatment of the neutral current $\\pi^0$ backgrounds. Using a $\\nu_\\mu$ -\n$\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ beam ratio between 3 : 2 and 2.5 : 2.5 (in unit of $10^{21}$POT\nwith the proton energy of 40 GeV), the mass hierarchy determination with the\nmedian sensitivity of 3 - 5 $\\sigma$ by the T2KK and 1 - 4 $\\sigma$ by the T2KO\nexperiment are expected when $\\sin^2\\theta_{23} = 0.5$, depending on the mass\nhierarchy pattern and CP phase. These sensitivities are enhanced (reduced) by\n$30\\%$ - $40\\%$ in $\\Delta \\chi^2$ when $\\sin^2\\theta_{23} = 0.6\\, (0.4)$. The\nCP phase is measured with the uncertainty of $20^\\circ$ - $50^\\circ$ by the\nT2KK and T2KO using the $\\nu_\\mu$ - $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ focusing beam ratio between\n3.5 : 1.5 and 1.5 : 3.5. These findings indicate that inclusion of the\n$\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ focusing beam improves the sensitivities of the T2KK and T2KO\nexperiments to both the mass hierarchy determination and leptonic CP phase\nmeasurement simultaneously with the preferred beam ratio being between 3 : 2 -\n2.5 : 2.5 ($\\times 10^{21}$POT).\n", "  Cells can be considered as systems that utilize changes in thermodynamic\nentropy as information. Therefore, they serve as useful models for\ninvestigating the relationships between entropy production and information\ntransmission, i.e., signal transduction. Based on the hypothesis that cells\napply a chemical reaction cascade for the most efficient transduction of\ninformation, we adopted a coding design that minimizes the number of bits per\nconcentration of molecules that are employed for information transduction. As a\nresult, the average rate of entropy production is uniform across all cycles in\na cascade reaction. Thus, the entropy production rate can be a valuable measure\nfor the quantification of intracellular signal transduction.\n", "  In this article we will discuss a Lorentzian sector calculation of the\nentropy of a minimally coupled scalar field in the Kerr black hole background.\nWe will use the brick wall model of t' Hooft. In the Kerr black hole,\ncomplications arise due to the absence of a global timelike Killing field and\nthe presence of the ergosphere. Nevertheless, it is possible to calculate the\nentropy of a thin shell of matter field in the near-horizon region using the\nbrick wall model. The corresponding leading order entropy of the\nnonsuperradiant modes is found to be proportional to the area of the horizon\nand is logarithmically divergent. Thus, the entropy of a three dimensional\nsystem in the near-horizon region is proportional to the boundary surface. This\nis similar to that of the black hole entropy itself. The corresponding internal\nenergy remains finite if the entropy is chosen to be of the order of the black\nhole entropy itself. For a fixed value of the brick wall cut-off, the leading\norder entropy in the Kerr black hole is found to be half of the corresponding\nterm in the Schwarzschild black hole. This is consistent with the preferential\nemission of particles in the Kerr black hole with azimuthal angular momentum in\nthe same direction as that of the black hole itself. However, we can obtain the\nSchwarzschild case expression by including a subleading term and taking the\nappropriate limit. The results obtained in this article may be relevant to\nentropy bound and holographic principle.\n", "  In this paper, we present a theoretical simulation of 87Rb absorption\nspectrum in a thermal cm-cell which is adaptive to the experimental\nobservation. In experiment, the coupling and probe beams are configured to\ncopropagate but perpendicular polarized, making up to five velocity selective\noptical pumping (VSOP) absorption dips able to be identified. A $\\Lambda$-type\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is also observed for each group\nof velocity-selected atoms. The spectrum by only sweeping the probe beam can be\ndecomposed into a combination of Doppler-broadened background and three VSOP\ndips for each group of velocity-selected atoms, companied by an EIT peak. This\nproposed theoretical model can be used to simulate the spectrum adaptive to the\nexperimental observation by non-linear least-square fit method. The fit for\nhigh quality of experimental observation can determine valuable transition\nparameters such as decaying rates and coupling beam power accurately.\n", "  In a paper by Popescu and Rohrlich [Phys. Lett. A 166, 293 (1992)] a proof\nhas been presented showing that any pure entangled multiparticle quantum state\nviolates some Bell inequality. We point out a gap in this proof, but we also\ngive a construction to close this gap. It turns out that with some extra effort\nall the results from the aforementioned publication can be proven. Our\nconstruction shows how two-particle entanglement can be generated via\nperforming local projections on a multiparticle state.\n", "  Turbulence is an ubiquitous phenomenon in natural and industrial flows. Since\nthe celebrated work of Kolmogorov in 1941, understanding the statistical\nproperties of fully developed turbulence has remained a major quest. In\nparticular, deriving the properties of turbulent flows from a mesoscopic\ndescription, that is from Navier-Stokes equation, has eluded most theoretical\nattempts. Here, we provide a theoretical prediction for the {\\it space and\ntime} dependent velocity-velocity correlation function of homogeneous and\nisotropic turbulence from the field theory associated to Navier-Stokes equation\nwith stochastic forcing. This prediction is the analytical fixed-point solution\nof Non-Perturbative Renormalisation Group flow equations, which are exact in a\ncertain large wave-number limit. This solution is compared to two-point\ntwo-times correlation functions computed in direct numerical simulations. We\nobtain a remarkable agreement both in the inertial and in the dissipative\nranges.\n", "  We conjecture an explicit formula for the image of a tensor product of\nKirillov-Reshetikhin crystals $\\bigotimes_{i=1}^m B^{1, s_i}$ under the\nKirillov-Schilling-Shimozono bijection. Our conjectured formula is\npiecewise-linear, where the shapes are given by the tropicalization of\ncylindric loop Schur functions and the riggings are given by the\ntropicalization of loop Schur functions. We prove that our formula changes the\nriggings by the correct amount based upon the time evolution of the\ncorresponding box-ball system. We show that our formula is correct under the\ncolumn splitting portion of the Kirillov-Schilling-Shimozono bijection and for\n$B^{1, s}$.\n", "  Ongoing astronomical efforts extract physical properties of black holes from\nelectromagnetic emissions in their near-vicinity. This requires finding the\nnull geodesics which extend from the near-horizon region out to a distant\nobservatory. In general these can only be found numerically. In this paper, for\nthe interesting special case of extremally spinning Kerr black holes, we use an\nemergent near-horizon conformal symmetry to find near-superradiant geodesics\nanalytically.\n", "  We propose a new model to account for the main structural characteristics of\nrock fracture networks (RFNs). The model is based on a generalization of the\nrandom neighborhood graphs to consider fractures embedded into rectangular\nspaces. We study a series of 29 real-world RFNs and find the best fit with the\nrandom rectangular neighborhood graphs (RRNGs) proposed here. We show that this\nmodel captures most of the structural characteristics of the RFNs and allows a\ndistinction between small and more spherical rocks and large and more elongated\nones. We use a diffusion equation on the graphs in order to model diffusive\nprocesses taking place through the channels of the RFNs. We find a small set of\nstructural parameters that highly correlates with the average diffusion time in\nthe RFNs. We found analytically some bounds for the diameter and the algebraic\nconnectivity of these graphs that allow to bound the diffusion time in these\nnetworks. We also show that the RRNGs can be used as a suitable model to\nreplace the RFNs in the study of diffusion-like processes. Indeed, the\ndiffusion time in RFNs can be predicted by using structural and dynamical\nparameters of the RRNGs. Finally, we also explore some potential extensions of\nour model to include variable fracture apertures, the possibility of long-range\nhops of the diffusive particles as a way to account for heterogeneities in the\nmedium and possible superdiffusive processes, and the extension of the model to\n3-dimensional space.\n", "  We perform a forecast analysis of the capability of the eLISA space-based\ninterferometer to constrain models of early and interacting dark energy using\ngravitational wave standard sirens. We employ simulated catalogues of standard\nsirens given by merging massive black hole binaries visible by eLISA, with an\nelectromagnetic counterpart detectable by future telescopes. We consider\nthree-arms mission designs with arm length of 1, 2 and 5 million km, 5 years of\nmission duration and the best-level low frequency noise as recently tested by\nthe LISA Pathfinder. Standard sirens with eLISA give access to an intermediate\nrange of redshift $1\\lesssim z \\lesssim 8$, and can therefore provide\ncompetitive constraints on models where the onset of the deviation from\n$\\Lambda$CDM (i.e. the epoch when early dark energy starts to be\nnon-negligible, or when the interaction with dark matter begins) occurs\nrelatively late, at $z\\lesssim 6$. If instead early or interacting dark energy\nis relevant already in the pre-recombination era, current cosmological probes\n(especially the cosmic microwave background) are more efficient than eLISA in\nconstraining these models, except possibly in the interacting dark energy model\nif the energy exchange is proportional to the energy density of dark energy.\n", "  Entanglement is an important concept in quantum information, quantum\ncommunication, and quantum computing. We provide a geometrical analysis of\nentanglement and separability for all the rank-2 quantum mixed states: complete\nanalysis for the bipartite states, and partial analysis for the multipartite\nstates. For each rank-2 mixed state, we define its unique Bloch sphere, that is\nspanned by the eigenstates of its density matrix. We characterize those Bloch\nspheres into exactly five classes of entanglement and separability, give\nexamples for each class, and prove that those are the only classes.\n", "  We present an elementary discussion of the momentum transferred to a\nconducting sheet by an electromagnetic wave propagating in a polarizable\nmedium. We show that conservation of momentum is consistent with Minkowski's\nexpression for the momentum density.\n", "  We study explicit formula (suggested by Gamayun, Iorgov, Lisovyy) for\nPainlev\\'e III($D_8$) $\\tau$ function in terms of Virasoro conformal blocks\nwith central charge $1$. The Painlev\\'e equation has two types of bilinear\nforms, we call them Toda-like and Okamoto-like. We obtain these equations from\nthe representation theory using an embedding of a direct sum of two Virasoro\nalgebra in a certain superalgebra. These two types of bilinear forms correspond\nto Neveu-Schwarz sector and Ramond sector of this algebra. We also obtain\n$\\tau$ functions of algebraic solutions of Painlev\\'e III($D_8$) from the\nspecial representations of the Virasoro algebra of highest weight $(n+1/4)^2$.\n", "  One of the important nonclassical effects in quantum optics is the\nanti-bunching, which has been observed in a large class of physical systems -\nincluding light-harvesting antennas with cyclic structures. The units of the\nring couple with adjacent ones through dipole-dipole interactions. We show how\nthis strong dipole-dipole interaction leads to photon-blockade resulting in the\nsuppression of double excitation pathway and anti-bunching in photosynthesis\nsystems. The robustness of the photon blockade is demonstrated against the\ndisorder in the ring structures. We hypothesis that the effect may be utilized\nby light-harvesting systems to avoid damages from excess energy.\n", "  Trial-and-error learning requires evaluating variable actions and reinforcing\nsuccessful variants. In songbirds, vocal exploration is induced by LMAN, the\noutput of a basal ganglia-circuit that also contributes a corrective bias to\nthe vocal output. This bias is gradually consolidated in RA, a motor cortex\nanalogue downstream of LMAN. We develop a new model of such two-stage learning.\nUsing stochastic gradient descent, we derive how the activity in 'tutor'\ncircuits (e.g., LMAN) should match plasticity mechanisms in 'student' circuits\n(e.g., RA) to achieve efficient learning. We further describe a reinforcement\nlearning framework through which the tutor can build its teaching signal. We\nshow that mismatches between the tutor signal and the plasticity mechanism can\nimpair learning. Applied to birdsong, our results predict the temporal\nstructure of the corrective bias from LMAN given a plasticity rule in RA. Our\nframework can be applied predictively to other paired brain areas showing\ntwo-stage learning.\n", "  We analyze the performance of decoders for the 2D and 4D toric code which are\nlocal by construction. The 2D decoder is a cellular automaton decoder\nformulated by Harrington which explicitly has a finite speed of communication\nand computation. For a model of independent $X$ and $Z$ errors and faulty\nsyndrome measurements with identical probability we report a threshold of\n$0.133\\%$ for this Harrington decoder. We implement a decoder for the 4D toric\ncode which is based on a decoder by Hastings arXiv:1312.2546 . Incorporating a\nmethod for handling faulty syndromes we estimate a threshold of $1.59\\%$ for\nthe same noise model as in the 2D case. We compare the performance of this\ndecoder with a decoder based on a 4D version of Toom's cellular automaton rule\nas well as the decoding method suggested by Dennis et al.\narXiv:quant-ph/0110143 .\n", "  Controlled organic functionalization of silicon surfaces as integral part of\nsemiconductor technology offers new perspectives for a wide range of\napplications. The high reactivity of the silicon dangling bonds, however,\npresents a major hindrance for the first basic reaction step of such a\nfunctionalization, i.e., the chemoselective attachment of bifunctional organic\nmolecules on the pristine silicon surface. We overcome this problem by\nemploying cyclooctyne as the major building block of our strategy.\nFunctionalized cyclooctynes are shown to react on Si(001) selectively via the\nstrained cyclooctyne triple bond while leaving the side groups intact. The\nachieved selectivity originates from the distinctly different adsorption\ndynamics of the separate functionalities: A direct adsorption pathway is\ndemonstrated for cyclooctyne as opposed to the vast majority of other organic\nfunctional groups. The latter ones react on Si(001) via a metastable\nintermediate which makes them effectively unreactive in competition with the\ndirect pathway of cyclooctyne's strained triple bond.\n", "  Majorana zero modes at the boundaries of topological superconductors are\ncharge-neutral, an equal superposition of electrons and holes. This ideal\nsituation is, however, hard to achieve in physical implementations, such as\nproximitised semiconducting nanowires of realistic length. In such systems\nMajorana overlaps are unavoidable and lead to their hybridisation into charged\nBogoliubov quasiparticles of finite energy which, unlike true zero modes, are\naffected by electronic interactions. We here demonstrate that these\ninteractions, particularly with bound charges in the dielectric surroundings,\ndrastically change the non-interacting paradigm. Remarkably, interactions may\ncompletely suppress Majorana hybridisation around parity crossings, where the\ntotal charge in the nanowire changes. This effect, dubbed zero-energy pinning,\nstabilises Majoranas back to zero energy and charge, and leads to\nelectronically incompressible parameter regions wherein Majoranas remain\ninsensitive to local perturbations, despite their overlap.\n", "  We consider Higgs boson pair production via gluon fusion in hadronic\ncollisions. We report the calculation of the transverse-momentum ($q_T$)\ndistribution of the Higgs boson pair with top-quark mass ($M_t$) effects fully\ntaken into account. At small values of $q_T$ we resum the\nlogarithmically-enhanced perturbative QCD contributions up to next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (NLL) accuracy. At intermediate and large values of $q_T$ we\nconsistently combine resummation with the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_S^3)$ fixed-order\nresults. After integration over $q_T$, we recover the next-to-leading order\n(NLO) result for the inclusive cross section with full dependence on $M_t$. We\npresent illustrative numerical results at LHC energies, together with an\nestimate of the corresponding perturbative uncertainties, and we study the\nimpact of the top-quark mass effects.\n", "  Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$) exhibits extremely large and unsaturated\nmagnetoresistance (MR). Due to the large spatially extensions of Te-5p and W-5d\norbitals, the electronic properties of WTe$_2$ are sensitive to the lattice\nstructures, which can probably affect the strongly temperature dependent MR\nfound in experiment. Based on first-principle calculations, we investigate the\ntemperature effect on the lattice and electronic structures of WTe$_2$. Our\nnumerical results show that the thermal expansion coefficients of WTe$_2$ are\nhighly anisotropic and considerably large. However, the temperature (less than\n300 K) has ignorable effect on the Fermi surface of WTe$_2$. Our theoretical\nresults clarify that the thermal expansion is not the main reason of the\ntemperature-induced rapid decrease of magnetoresistance.\n", "  We examine how to signify and quantify the mesoscopic quantum coherence of\napproximate two-mode NOON states and spin-squeezed two-mode Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BEC). We identify two criteria that verify a nonzero quantum\ncoherence between states with quantum number different by $n$. These criteria\nnegate certain mixtures of quantum states, thereby signifying a generalised\n$n$-scopic Schrodinger cat-type paradox. The first criterion is the correlation\n$\\langle\\hat{a}^{\\dagger n}\\hat{b}^{n}\\rangle\\neq0$ (here $\\hat{a}$ and\n$\\hat{b}$ are the boson operators for each mode). The correlation manifests as\ninterference fringes in $n$-particle detection probabilities and is also\nmeasurable via quadrature phase amplitude and spin squeezing measurements.\nMeasurement of $\\langle\\hat{a}^{\\dagger n}\\hat{b}^{n}\\rangle$ enables a\nquantification of the overall $n$-th order quantum coherence, thus providing an\navenue for high efficiency verification of a high-fidelity photonic NOON\nstates. The second criterion is based on a quantification of the measurable\nspin-squeezing parameter $\\xi_{N}$. We apply the criteria to theoretical models\nof NOON states in lossy interferometers and double-well trapped BECs. By\nanalysing existing BEC experiments, we demonstrate generalised atomic \"kitten\"\nstates and atomic quantum coherence with $n\\gtrapprox10$ atoms.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering reveals a broad continuum of excitations in\nPr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the temperature and magnetic field dependence of which\nindicate a continuous distribution of quenched transverse fields ($\\Delta$)\nacting on the non-Kramers Pr$^{3+}$ crystal field ground state doublets.\nSpin-ice correlations are apparent within 0.2 meV of the Zeeman energy. A\nrandom phase approximation provides an excellent account of the data with a\ntransverse field distribution $\\rho(\\Delta)\\propto (\\Delta^2+\\Gamma^2)^{-1}$\nwhere $ \\Gamma=0.27(1)$ meV. Established during high temperature synthesis due\nto an underlying structural instability, it appears disorder in\nPr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ actually induces a quantum spin liquid.\n", "  Lorentz Invariance Violation introduced as a generic modification to particle\ndispersion relations is used to study high energy cosmic ray attenuation\nprocesses. It is shown to reproduce the same physical effects for vacuum\nCherenkov radiation, as in some particular models with spontaneous breaking of\nLorentz symmetry. This approximation is also implemented for the study of\nphoton decay in vacuum, where stringent limits to the violation scale are\nderived from the direct observation of very high energy cosmic ray photon\nevents on gamma telescopes. Photo production processes by cosmic ray primaries\non photon background are also addressed, to show that Lorentz violation may\nturn off this attenuation process at energies above a well defined secondary\nthreshold.\n", "  The Bs to mu mu gamma decay offers sensitivity to a wider set of effective\noperators than its non-radiative counterpart Bs to mu mu, and a set that is\ninteresting in the light of present-day discrepancies in flavour data. On the\nother hand, the direct measurement of the Bs to mu mu gamma decay poses\nchallenges with respect to the Bs to mu mu one. We present a novel strategy to\nsearch for Bs to mu mu gamma decays in the very event sample selected for Bs to\nmu mu searches. The method consists in extracting the Bs to mu mu gamma\nspectrum as a \"contamination\" to the Bs to mu mu one, as the signal window for\nthe latter is extended downward with respect to the peak region. We provide\narguments for the actual practicability of the method already on Run-2 data of\nthe LHC.\n", "  Using $448.0 \\times 10^6$~$\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector, an amplitude analysis is performed for\n$\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma\\chi_{c1}$, $\\chi_{c1}\\to\\eta\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays. The most\ndominant two-body structure observed is $a_0(980)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$;\n$a_0(980)^{\\pm}\\to\\eta\\pi^{\\pm}$. The $a_0(980)$ line shape is modeled using a\ndispersion relation, and a significant non-zero $a_0(980)$ coupling to the\n$\\eta^{\\prime}\\pi$ channel is measured. We observe $\\chi_{c1}\\to a_2(1700)\\pi$\nproduction for the first time, with a significance larger than 17$\\sigma$. The\nproduction of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$, is\ninvestigated, and upper limits for the branching fractions $\\chi_{c1}\\to\n\\pi_1(1400)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$, $\\chi_{c1}\\to \\pi_1(1600)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$, and\n$\\chi_{c1}\\to\\pi_1(2015)^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$, with subsequent $\\pi_1(X)^{\\pm} \\to\n\\eta\\pi^{\\pm}$ decay, are determined.\n", "  We compare the irreversible work produced in an infinitesimal sudden quench\nof a quantum system at zero temperature with its ground state fidelity\nsusceptibility, giving an explicit relation between the two quantities. We find\nthat the former is proportional to the latter but for an extra term appearing\nin the irreversible work which includes also contributions from the excited\nstates. We calculate explicitly the two quantities in the case of the quantum\nIsing chain, showing that at criticality they exhibit different scaling\nbehavior. The irreversible work, rescaled by square of the quench's amplitude,\nexhibits a divergence slower than the fidelity susceptibility one. As a\nconsequence, the two quantities obey also different finite-size scaling\nrelations.\n", "  We present spatially- and spectrally-resolved photoluminescence measurements\nof indirect excitons in high magnetic fields. Long indirect exciton lifetimes\ngive the opportunity to measure magnetoexciton transport by optical imaging.\nIndirect excitons formed from electrons and holes at zeroth Landau levels (0e -\n0h indirect magnetoexcitons) travel over large distances and form a ring\nemission pattern around the excitation spot. In contrast, the spatial profiles\nof 1e - 1h and 2e - 2h indirect magnetoexciton emission closely follow the\nlaser excitation profile. The 0e - 0h indirect magnetoexciton transport\ndistance reduces with increasing magnetic field. These effects are explained in\nterms of magnetoexciton energy relaxation and effective mass enhancement.\n", "  The discovery of the astrophysical events GW150926 and GW151226 has\nexperimentally confirmed the existence of gravitational waves (GW) and has\ndemonstrated the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This\nfinding marks the beginning of a new era that will reveal unexpected features\nof our universe. This work presents a basic insight to the fundamental theory\nof GW emitted by inspiral binary systems and describes the scientific and\ntechnological efforts developed to measure these waves using the\ninterferometer-based detector called LIGO. Subsequently, the work presents a\ncomprehensive data analysis methodology based on the matched filter algorithm,\nwhich aims to recovery GW signals emitted by inspiral binary systems of\nastrophysical sources. This algorithm was evaluated with freely available LIGO\ndata containing injected GW waveforms. Results of the experiments performed to\nassess detection accuracy showed the recovery of 85% of the injected GW.\n", "  We systematically investigated the spin wave-assisted magnetization switching\n(SWAS) of a L10-FePt / Ni81Fe19 (Permalloy; Py) exchange-coupled bilayer using\na pulse-like rf field (hrf) and mapped the switching events in the magnetic\nfield (H) - hrf frequency (f) plane to reveal the switching conditions. The\nswitching occurred only in a limited region following the dispersion\nrelationship of the perpendicular standing spin wave (PSSW) modes in Py. The\nresults indicate that SWAS is a resonant magnetization switching process, which\nis different from the conventional microwave assisted switching, and has the\npotential to be applied to selective switching for multilevel recording media.\n", "  An effective medium model is developed for disordered metamaterials\ncontaining a spatially random distribution of dielectric spheres. Similar to\neffective medium models for ordered metamaterials, this model predicts\nresonances in the effective permeability and permittivity arising from\nelectric- and magnetic-dipole Mie resonances in the spheres. In addition, the\nmodel predicts a redshift of the electric resonance with increasing particle\nloading. Interestingly, when the particle loading exceeds the percolation\nthreshold of 33\\%, the model predicts that the electric resonance overlaps with\nthe magnetic resonance, resulting in a negative refractive index.\n", "  The cross section for the process $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-J/\\psi$ is measured\nprecisely at center-of-mass energies from 3.77 to 4.60~GeV using 9~fb$^{-1}$ of\ndata collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring.\nTwo resonant structures are observed in a fit to the cross section. The first\nresonance has a mass of $(4222.0\\pm 3.1\\pm 1.4)$~MeV/$c^2$ and a width of\n$(44.1\\pm 4.3\\pm 2.0)$~MeV, while the second one has a mass of $(4320.0\\pm 10.4\n\\pm 7.0)$~MeV/$c^2$ and a width of $(101.4^{+25.3}_{-19.7}\\pm 10.2)$~MeV, where\nthe first errors are statistical and second ones are systematic. The first\nresonance agrees with the $Y(4260)$ resonance reported by previous experiments.\nThe precision of its resonant parameters is improved significantly. The second\nresonance is observed in $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-J/\\psi$ for the first time. The\nstatistical significance of this resonance is estimated to be larger than\n$7.6\\sigma$. The mass and width of the second resonance agree with the\n$Y(4360)$ resonance reported by the $BABAR$ and Belle experiments within\nerrors. Finally, the $Y(4008)$ resonance previously observed by the Belle\nexperiment is not confirmed in the description of the BESIII data.\n", "  Based on a recent unified formulation on dichorism and extinction of helicity\non scattering by a small particle, dipolar in the wide sense, magnetodielectric\nor not, chiral or achiral, we show that such extinction is enhanced not only at\nresonances of the polarizabilities, but also due to interference between left\nand right circularly polarized components of the incident wave, which\ncontributes with appropriate parameters of the illuminating field, even if the\nparticle is achiral and is placed at points of the incident field at which the\nlocal incident helicity density is zero.\n  This phenomenon goes beyond standard circular dichroism (CD), and we analyze\nit in detail on account of the values of the several quantities, both of the\nincident light and the particle, involved in the process. In addition, this\ninterference produces a term in the helicity extinction that remarkably yields\ninformation on the real parts of the electric and/or magnetic polarizabilities,\nwhich are not provided by CD, of which that helicity extinction phenomenon may\nbe considered a generalization.\n", "  We investigate lepton flavour violation in a class of minimal left-right\nsymmetric models where the left-right symmetry is broken by triplet scalars. In\nthis context we present a method to consistently calculate the triplet-Yukawa\ncouplings which takes into account the experimental data while simultaneously\nrespecting the underlying symmetries. Analysing various scenarios, we then\ncalculate the full set of tree-level and one-loop contributions to all\nradiative and three-body flavour-violating fully leptonic decays as well as\n$\\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei. Our method illustrates how these processes depend\non the underlying parameters of the theory. To that end we observe that, for\nmany choices of the model parameters, there is a strong complementarity between\nthe different observables. For instance, in a large part of the parameter\nspace, lepton flavour violating $\\tau$-decays have a large enough branching\nratio to be measured in upcoming experiments. Our results further show that\nexperiments coming online in the immediate future, like Mu3e and BELLE II, or\nlonger-term, such as PRISM/PRIME, will probe significant portions of the\ncurrently allowed parameter space.\n", "  The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is studied in multilayer\nnetworks with arbitrary number of links across the layers. By following the\nmapping to bond percolation we give the analytical expression for the epidemic\nthreshold and the fraction of the infected individuals in arbitrary number of\nlayers. These results provide an exact prediction of the epidemic threshold for\ninfinite locally tree-like multilayer networks, and an lower bound of the\nepidemic threshold for more general multilayer networks. The case of a\nmultilayer network formed by two interconnected networks is specifically\nstudied as a function of the degree distribution within and across the layers.\nWe show that the epidemic threshold strongly depends on the degree correlations\nof the multilayer structure. Finally we relate our results to the results\nobtained in the annealed approximation for the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible\n(SIS) model.\n", "  We discuss the unitarity of the quantum evolution between arbitrary Cauchy\nsurfaces of a 1+1 dimensional free scalar field defined on a bounded spatial\nregion and subject to several types of boundary conditions including Dirichlet,\nNeumann and Robin.\n", "  The problem of finding symmetric informationally complete POVMs (SIC-POVMs)\nhas been solved numerically for all dimensions $d$ up to 67 (A.J. Scott and M.\nGrassl, {\\it J. Math. Phys.} 51:042203, 2010), but a general proof of existence\nis still lacking. For each dimension, it was shown that it is possible to find\na SIC-POVM which is generated from a fiducial state upon application of the\noperators of the Heisenberg-Weyl group. We draw on the numerically determined\nfiducial states to study their phase-space features, as displayed by the\ncharacteristic function and the Wigner, Bargmann and Husimi representations,\nadapted to a Hilbert space of finite dimension. We analyze the phase-space\nlocalization of fiducial states, and observe that the SIC-POVM condition is\nequivalent to a maximal delocalization property. Finally, we explore the\nconsequences in phase space of the conjectured Zauner symmetry. In particular,\nwe construct an Hermitian operator commuting with this symmetry that leads to a\nrepresentation of fiducial states in terms of eigenfunctions with definite\nsemiclassical features.\n", "  We study the thermodynamic properties of four-component fermionic mixtures\ndescribed by the Hubbard model using the dynamical mean-field-theory approach.\nSpecial attention is given to the system with SU(4)-symmetric interactions at\nhalf filling, where we analyze equilibrium many-body phases and their\ncoexistence regions at nonzero temperature for the case of simple cubic lattice\ngeometry. We also determine the evolution of observables in low-temperature\nphases while lowering the symmetry of the Hamiltonian towards the two-band\nHubbard model. This is achieved by varying interflavor interactions or by\nintroducing the spin-flip term (Hund's coupling). By calculating the entropy\nfor different symmetries of the model, we determine the optimal regimes for\napproaching the studied phases in experiments with ultracold alkali and\nalkaline-earth-like atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  Holographic renormalization is a systematic procedure for regulating\ndivergences in observables in asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes. For dual\nboundary field theories which are supersymmetric it is natural to ask whether\nthis defines a supersymmetric renormalization scheme. Recent results in\nlocalization have brought this question into sharp focus: rigid supersymmetry\non a curved boundary requires specific geometric structures, and general\narguments imply that BPS observables, such as the partition function, are\ninvariant under certain deformations of these structures. One can then ask if\nthe dual holographic observables are similarly invariant. We study this\nquestion in minimal N = 2 gauged supergravity in four and five dimensions. In\nfour dimensions we show that holographic renormalization precisely reproduces\nthe expected field theory results. In five dimensions we find that no choice of\nstandard holographic counterterms is compatible with supersymmetry, which leads\nus to introduce novel finite boundary terms. For a class of solutions\nsatisfying certain topological assumptions we provide some independent tests of\nthese new boundary terms, in particular showing that they reproduce the\nexpected VEVs of conserved charges.\n", "  The possibility is considered that, after nuclear recoil caused by elastic\nscattering with Light Dark Matter, atoms in superfluid He4 may create quantized\nvortex rings, which can thereafter be detected. The concept for sort of\ntelescope for LDM is presented, which would be sensitive to its motion through\nthe Galactic LDM wind. A demonstrator is proposed, which makes use of thermal\nneutrons.\n", "  We investigate the Gorkov--Melik-Barkhudarov (GM) correction to superfluid\ntransition temperature in two-dimensional Fermi gases with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) across the SOC-driven BCS-BEC crossover. In the calculation of\nthe induced interaction, we find that the spin-component mixing due to SOC can\ninduce both of the conventional screening and additional antiscreening\ncontributions that interplay significantly in the strong SOC regime. While the\nGM correction generally lowers the estimate of transition temperature, it turns\nout that at a fixed weak interaction, the correction effect exhibits a\ncrossover behavior where the ratio between the estimates without and with the\ncorrection first decreases with SOC and then becomes insensitive to SOC when it\ngoes into the strong SOC regime. We demonstrate the applicability of the GM\ncorrection by comparing the zero-temperature condensate fraction with the\nrecent quantum Monte Carlo results.\n", "  We discuss the application of numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCEs) to\nstudy one dimensional lattice systems in thermal equilibrium and after quantum\nquenches from thermal equilibrium states. For the former, we calculate\nobservables in the grand canonical ensemble, and for the latter we calculate\nobservables in the diagonal ensemble. When converged, NLCEs provide results in\nthe thermodynamic limit. We use two different NLCEs - a maximally connected\nexpansion introduced in previous works and a site-based expansion. We compare\nthe effectiveness of both NLCEs. The site-based NLCE is found to work best for\nsystems in thermal equilibrium. However, in thermal equilibrium and after\nquantum quenches, the site-based NLCE can diverge when the maximally connected\none converges. We relate this divergence to the exponentially large number of\nclusters in the site-based NLCE and the behavior of the weights of observables\nin those clusters. We discuss the effectiveness of resummations to cure the\ndivergence. Our NLCE calculations are compared to exact diagonalization ones in\nlattices with periodic boundary conditions. NLCEs are found to outperform exact\ndiagonalization in periodic systems for all quantities studied.\n", "  Trapped ions are excellent candidates for quantum nodes, as they possess many\ndesirable features of a network node including long-lifetimes, on-site\nprocessing capability and produce photonic flying qubits. However, unlike\nclassical networks in which data may be transmitted in optical fibers and the\nrange of communication readily extended with amplifiers, quantum systems often\nemit photons that have limited propagation range in optical fibers and, by\nvirtue of the nature of a quantum state, cannot be noiselessly amplified. Here,\nwe first describe a method to extract flying qubits from a Ba$^+$ trapped ion\nvia shelving to a long lived, low-lying D-state with higher entanglement\nprobabilities compared with current strong and weak excitation methods. We show\na projected fidelity of $\\approx$89% of the ion-photon entanglement. We compare\nseveral methods of ion-photon entanglement generation and show how the fidelity\nand entanglement probability varies as a function of the photon collection\noptic's numerical aperture. We then outline an approach for quantum frequency\nconversion of the photons emitted by the Ba$^+$ ion to the telecom range for\nlong-distance networking and to 780 nm, for potential entanglement with\nRubidium based quantum memories. Our approach is significant for extending the\nrange of quantum networks and for development of hybrid quantum networks\ncompromised of different types of quantum memories.\n", "  We evaluate the amount of fine-tuning in constrained versions of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM), with different boundary conditions at the\nGUT scale. Specifically we study the fully constrained version as well as the\ncases of non-universal Higgs and gaugino masses. We allow for the presence of\nadditional non-holomorphic soft-terms which we show further relax the\nfine-tuning. Of particular importance is the possibility of a Higgsino mass\nterm and we discuss possible origins for such a term in UV complete models. We\npoint out that loop corrections typically lead to a reduction in the\nfine-tuning by a factor of about two compared to the estimate at tree-level,\nwhich has been overlooked in many recent works. Taking these loop corrections\ninto account, we discuss the impact of current limits from SUSY searches and\ndark matter on the fine-tuning. Contrary to common lore, we find that the MSSM\nfine-tuning can be as small as 10 while remaining consistent with all\nexperimental constraints. If, in addition, the dark matter abundance is fully\nexplained by the neutralino LSP, the fine-tuning can still be as low as $\\sim$\n20 in the presence of additional non-holomorphic soft-terms. We also discuss\nfuture prospects of these models and find that the MSSM will remain natural\neven in the case of a non-discovery in the foreseeable future.\n", "  The wealth of work in backward Raman amplification in plasma has focused on\nthe extreme intensity limit, however backward Raman amplification may also\nprovide an effective and practical mechanism for generating intense, broad\nbandwidth, long-wavelength infrared radiation (LWIR). An electromagnetic\nsimulation coupled with a relativistic cold fluid plasma model is used to\ndemonstrate the generation of picosecond pulses at a wavelength of 10 microns\nwith terawatt powers through backward Raman amplification. The effects of\ncollisional damping, Landau damping, pump depletion, and wave breaking are\nexamined, as well as the resulting design considerations for a LWIR Raman\namplifier.\n", "  Recent analyses of cosmic microwave background surveys have revealed hints\nthat there may be a non-trivial running of the running of the spectral index.\nIf future experiments were to confirm these hints, it would prove a powerful\ndiscriminator of inflationary models, ruling out simple single field models. We\ndiscuss how isocurvature perturbations in multi-field models can be invoked to\ngenerate large runnings in a non-standard hierarchy, and find that a minimal\nmodel capable of practically realising this would be a two-field model with a\nnon-canonical kinetic structure. We also consider alternative scenarios such as\nvariable speed of light models and canonical quantum gravity effects and their\nimplications for runnings of the spectral index.\n", "  In this paper, following the basic prescriptions of Gauge/String duality, we\nperform a strong coupling computation on \\textit{classical} two point\ncorrelation between \\textit{local} (single trace) operators in a gauge theory\ndual to $ \\kappa $-deformed $ AdS_{3}\\times S^{3}$ background. Our construction\nis based on the prescription that relates every local operator in a gauge\ntheory to that with the (semi)classical string states propagating within the\n\\textit{physical} region surrounded by the holographic screen in deformed $\nAdS_3 $. In our analysis, we treat strings as being that of a point like object\nlocated near the physical boundary of the $ \\kappa $- deformed Euclidean\nPoincare $ AdS_{3} $ and as an extended object with non trivial dynamics\nassociated to $ S^{3} $. It turns out that in the presence of small background\ndeformations, the usual power law behavior associated with two point functions\nis suppressed exponentially by a non trivial factor which indicates a faster\ndecay of two point correlations with larger separations. On the other hand, in\nthe limit of large background deformations ($ \\kappa \\gg 1 $), the\ncorresponding two point function reaches a point of saturation. In our\nanalysis, we also compute finite size corrections associated with these two\npoint functions at strong coupling. As a consistency check of our analysis, we\nfind perfect agreement between our results to that with the earlier\nobservations made in the context of vanishing deformation.\n", "  The Szekeres system is studied with two methods for the determination of\nconservation laws. Specifically we apply the theory of group invariant\ntransformations and the method of singularity analysis. We show that the\nSzekeres system admits a Lagrangian and the conservation laws that we find can\nbe derived by the application of Noether's theorem. The stability for the\nspecial solutions of the Szekeres system is studied and it is related with the\nwith the Left or Right Painlev\\'e Series which describes the expansions.\n", "  We report the results of a 154 MHz survey to search for emission from\nexoplanets located in the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Sco Cen OB2\nAssociation, the closest substantial region of recent star formation. This\nsurvey is different from previous efforts in that it is the first to target\nexoplanets orbiting Myr-old stars. Young exoplanet systems are expected to be\nthe best candidates for radio detections given the higher magnetic field\nstrengths predicted for young planets as well as the stronger and more dense\nstellar wind expected for the host stars. The radio emission from exoplanets is\nexpected to be highly circularly polarised therefore we restricted our search\nto the circular polarisation images rather than the total intensity images. We\ncarried out two different search methods using this data. The first method was\na targeted search for exoplanet emission using catalogues of known stars and\nHot Jupiters within the Upper Scorpius field. The second search method was a\nblind search for highly circularly polarised sources in the field and for\nsources identified only in our polarisation images. Both the blind and targeted\nsearch resulted in non-detections with typical 3-sigma flux density limits of\n4--235 mJy over timescales of 1.87--1000 minutes. In particular, we place the\nfirst limits on low-frequency emission from the Hot Jupiter systems WASP-17 b\nand K2-33 b. These are the first results from a larger program to\nsystematically search for low-frequency radio emission from planets orbiting\nyoung stars.\n", "  A low cost, stable, programmable, unipolar current source is described. The\ncircuit is designed in view of a modular arrangement, suitable for applications\nwhere several DC sources must be controlled at once. A hybrid switching/linear\ndesign helps in improving the stability and in reducing the power dissipation\nand cross-talking. Multiple units can be supplied by a single DC power supply,\nwhile allowing for a variety of maximal current values and compliance voltages\nat the outputs. The circuit is analogically controlled by an unipolar voltage,\nenabling current programmability and control through commercial\ndigital-to-analogue conversion cards.\n", "  We present the HST WFC3/F275W UV imaging observations of A2218-Flanking, a\nlensed compact dwarf galaxy at redshift $z\\approx2.5$. The stellar mass of\nA2218-Flanking is $\\log(M/M_{\\odot}=9.14$ and SFR is 12.5$M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$\nafter correcting the magnification. This galaxy has a young galaxy age of 127\nMyr and a compact galaxy size of $r_{1/2}=2.4$kpc. The HST UV imaging\nobservations cover the rest-frame Lyman continuum (LyC) emission\n($\\sim800${\\AA}) from A2218-Flanking. We firmly detect ($14\\sigma$) the LyC\nemission in A2218-Flanking in the F275W image. Together with the HST F606W\nimages, we find that the absolute escape fraction of LyC is $f_{\\rm\nabs,esc}>28-57\\%$ based on the flux density ratio between 1700{\\AA} and\n800{\\AA} ($f_{1700}/f_{800}$). The morphology of the LyC emission in the F275W\nimages is extended and well follows the morphology of the UV continuum\nmorphology in the F606W images, suggesting that the $f_{800}$ is not from\nforeground contaminants. We find that the region with a high star formation\nrate surface density has a lower $f_{1700}/f_{800}$ (higher $f_{800}/f_{1700}$)\nratio than the diffused regions, suggesting that LyC photons are more likely to\nescape from the region with the intensive star-forming process. We compare the\nproperties of galaxies with and without LyC detections and find that LyC\nphotons are easier to escape in low mass galaxies.\n", "  The 5 independent correlations between the properties of galaxies observed\noutside big clusters must set such strong constraints on any theory of galaxy\nformation that it is hard to imagine any but the right one passing muster;\ncertainly the standard model of Hierarchical Formation does not. Furthermore\nthose global correlations imply that such galaxies must be remarkably simple,\ni.e. have virtually all of their variance attributable to a single Principal\nComponent. That being so the correlations ought to give strong hints as to the\nprocess of formation. Two in particular: all galaxies have the same\nLuminosity-Density, while Luminosity and Dynamical Mass are everywhere tightly\ncorrelated, hint that formation took place at the epoch of Recombination.\nHalving of particle numbers then will set up strong pressure-forces which could\nfragment the medium and halt the expansion of neutral fragments, if they are\nnot too large. We find that fragments between $10^{11} $ and $10^{6} $ solar\nmasses (baryonic) will collapse gravitationally upon themselves, mostly\nflattening in one dimension, to form galaxies between 10 kpc. and 0.3 kpc. in\nsize, and in two distinct classes. Those below $10^{8}$ solar masses will\nremain transparent and cool, eventually sub-fragmenting into stars with a warm,\nspheroidal distribution, while those above will become opaque and thus too hot\nto form stars until after they have radiated away most of their axial binding\nenergy. They will then settle into thin discs with a low axial velocity\ndispersion. This simple scenario generates most of the properties of the\ngalaxies but not flat rotation-curves. Finally we attempt to weigh up its pros\nand cons as a viable theory of galaxy formation and conclude that it is much\nsuperior to the Hierarchical model when it comes to fitting most observations.\nAt the very least it deserves further critical evaluation.\n", "  The time-averaged Lyapunov exponents support a mechanistic description of the\nchaos generated in and by nonlinear dynamical systems. The exponents are\nordered from largest to smallest with the largest one describing the\nexponential growth rate of the (small) distance between two neighboring\nphase-space trajectories. Two exponents describe the rate for areas defined by\nthree nearby trajectories. The sum of the first three exponents is the rate for\nvolumes defined by four nearby trajectories, and so on. Lyapunov exponents for\nHamiltonian systems are symmetric. The time-reversibility of the motion\nequations links the growth and decay rates together in pairs. This pairing\nprovides a more detailed explanation than Liouville's for the conservation of\nphase volume in Hamiltonian mechanics. Although correct for long-time averages,\nthe dependence of trajectories on their past is responsible for the observed\nlack of detailed pairing for the instantaneous \"local\" exponents, $\\{\\\n\\lambda_i(t) \\ \\}$ . The 2017 Ian Snook Prizes will be awarded to the author(s)\nof an accessible and pedagogical discussion of local Lyapunov instability in\nsmall systems. We desire that this discussion build on the two nonlinear models\ndescribed here, a double pendulum with Hooke's-Law links and a periodic chain\nof Hooke's-Law particles tethered to their lattice sites. The latter system is\nthe $\\phi^4$ model popularized by Aoki and Kusnezov. A four-particle version is\nsmall enough for comprehensive numerical work and large enough to illustrate\nideas of general validity.\n", "  New exact analytical bound-state solutions of the D-dimensional Klein-Gordon\nequation for a large set of couplings and potential functions are obtained via\nmapping onto the nonrelativistic bound-state solutions of the one-dimensional\ngeneralized Morse potential. The eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of\ngeneralized Laguerre polynomials, and the eigenenergies are expressed in terms\nof solutions of irrational equations at the worst. Several analytical results\nfound in the literature, including the so-called Klein-Gordon oscillator, are\nobtained as particular cases of this unified approach\n", "  The Rohde--Schramm theorem states that Schramm--Loewner Evolution with\nparameter $\\kappa$ (or SLE$_\\kappa$ for short) exists as a random curve, almost\nsurely, if $\\kappa \\neq 8$. Here we give a new and concise proof of the result,\nbased on the Liouville quantum gravity coupling (or reverse coupling) with a\nGaussian free field. This transforms the problem of estimating the derivative\nof the Loewner flow into estimating certain correlated Gaussian free fields.\nWhile the correlation between these fields is not easy to understand, a\nsurprisingly simple argument allows us to recover a derivative exponent first\nobtained by Rohde and Schramm, subsequently shown to be optimal by Lawler and\nViklund, which then implies the Rohde--Schramm theorem.\n", "  Tensor network methods provide an intuitive graphical language to describe\nquantum states, channels, open quantum systems and a class of numerical\napproximation methods that efficiently simulate certain many-body states in one\nspatial dimension. There are two fundamental types of tensor networks in wide\nuse today. The most common is similar to quantum circuits. The second is the\nbraided class of tensor networks, used in topological quantum computing.\nRecently a third class of tensor networks was discovered by Jaffe, Liu and\nWozniakowski---the JLW-model---notably, the wires carry charge excitations. The\nrules in which network components can be moved, merged and manipulated in a\ngraphical form of reasoning take an elegant form. For instance the relative\ncharge locations on wires carries precise meaning and changing the ordering\nmodifies a connected network specifically by a complex number. The type of\nisotopy discovered in the topological JLW-model provides an alternative means\nto reason about quantum information, computation and protocols. Here we recall\nthe tensor-network building blocks used in a controlled-NOT gate. Some open\nproblems related to the JLW-model are given.\n", "  The transition mechanism in high temperature cuprate superconductors is an\noutstanding puzzle. A previous suggestion on the role of non-linear local\nlattice instability modes on the microscopic pairing mechanism in high\ntemperature cuprate superconductors \\cite{Lee:JSNM09} is re-examined to provide\na viable mechanism for superconductivity in these cuprates via an unusual\nlattice vibration in which an electron is predominantly interacting with a\nnonlinear $Q_2$ mode of the oxygen clusters in the CuO$_2$ planes. It is shown\nthat the interaction has explicit d-wave symmetry and leads to an indirect\ncoupling of d-wave symmetry between electrons. As a follow-up of\n\\cite{Lee:JSNM09}, in this paper, we report detailed derivation of the\nsuperconducting gap equation and numerical solutions for the transition\ntemperature as inherently integrated into the so-called Extended Hubbard Model\n(EHM). A unique feature in the EHM is that the transition temperature has an\ninherent k-dependence. In addition, superconducting gap solutions are\nrestrained to specific regions in the first Brillouin zone (1BZ). It is very\nfeasible to expect that the EHM naturally inherits a huge parameter space in\nwhich experimentally measured results, such as the well-known superconducting\ndome and the phase diagram from electronic Raman scattering \\cite{Sacuto:RPP13}\ncan be accommodated. The EHM model hence offers a viable venue to search for or\nconfirm any signature in k-point-sensitive experimental measurements.\n", "  Mechanical and electronic properties of $s$-triazine are studied using\nfirst-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The in-plane\nstiffness and bulk modulus for $s$-triazine sheet are found to be less than\nthat of heptazine. The reduction can be related to the nature of the covalent\nbonds connecting the adjacent sheets and the number of atoms per unit cell. The\nPoisson's ratio of $s$-triazine is half the value to that of graphene.\nAdditionally, the calculated values of the two critical strains (elastic and\nyielding points) of $s$-triazine sheet are in the same order of magnitude to\nthat for heptazine which was calculated using MD simulations in the literature.\nIt is also demonstrated that $s$-triazine sheet can withstand larger tension in\nthe plastic region. These results established a stable mechanical property for\n$s$-triazine sheet. We found a linear relationship of bandgap as a function of\nbi-axial tensile strain within the harmonic elastic region. The reduced steric\nrepulse of the lone pairs ($\\mathrm{p}_x$-, $\\mathrm {p}_y$-) causes the\n$\\mathrm {p}_z$-like orbital to shift to high energy, and consequently an\nincrease in the bandgap. We find no electronic properties modulation of the\n$s$-triazine sheet under electric field up to a peak value of 10 V/nm. Such\nnoble properties may be useful in future nanomaterial applications.\n", "  We present a complete resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy . This\nis done by considering several new aspects which invalidate previous\ndiscussions. We show that: 1)For polarized matter the center of mass theorem is\nno longer valid in its usual form. A contribution related to microscopic spin\nshould be considered. 2)The electromagnetic dipolar energy density contributes\nto the inertia of matter and should be incorporated covariantly to the the\nenergy-momentum tensor of matter. Then there is an electromagnetic component in\nmatter's momentum density whose variation explains the results of the only\nexperiment which supports Abraham's force. 3)Averaging the microscopic\nLorentz's force results in the unambiguos expression for the force density\nexerted by the field. This force density is consistent with all the\nexperimental evidence. 4)Momentum conservation determines the electromagnetic\nenergy-momentum tensor. This tensor is different from Abraham's and Minkowski's\ntensors, but one recovers Minkowski's expression for the momentum density. The\nenergy density is different from Poynting's expression but Poynting's vector\nremains the same. Our tensor is non-symmetric which allows the field to exert a\ndistributed torque on matter. We use our results to discuss momentum and\nangular momentum exchange in various situations of physical interest. We find\ncomplete consistency of our equations in the description of the systems\nconsidered. We also show that several alternative expressions of the field\nenergy-momentum tensor and force-density cannot be successfully used in all our\nexamples. In particular we verify in two of these examples that the center of\nmass and spin introduced by us moves with constant velocity, but that the\nstandard center of mass does not.\n", "  Effective gauge fields have allowed the emulation of matter under strong\nmagnetic fields leading to the realization of Harper-Hofstadter, Haldane\nmodels, and led to demonstrations of one-way waveguides and topologically\nprotected edge states. Central to these discoveries is the chirality induced by\ntime-symmetry breaking. Due to the discovery of quantum search algorithms based\non walks on graphs, recent work has discovered new implications the effect of\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking has on the transport of quantum states and has\nbrought with it a host of new experimental implementations. We provide a full\nclassification of the unitary operators defining quantum processes which break\ntime-reversal symmetry in their induced transition properties between basis\nelements in a preferred site-basis. Our results are furthermore proven in terms\nof the geometry of the corresponding Hamiltonian support graph and hence\nprovide a topological classification. A quantum process of this type is\nnecessarily time-symmetric for any choice of time-independent Hamiltonian if\nand only if the underlying support graph is bipartite. Moreover, for\nnon-bipartite support, there exists a time-independent Hamiltonian with\nnecessarily complex edge weights that induces time-asymmetric transition\nprobabilities between edge(s). We further prove that certain bipartite graphs\ngive rise to transition probability suppression, but not broken time-reversal\nsymmetry. These results fill an important missing gap in understanding the role\nthis omnipresent effect has in quantum physics. Furthermore, through our\ndevelopment of a general framework, along the way to our results we completely\ncharacterize gauge potentials on combinatorial graphs.\n", "  Shortfalls in cosmic ray (CR) propagation models obscure the CR sources and\nacceleration mechanisms. This problem became particularly obvious after the\nFermi, Pamela, and AMS-02 have discovered the electron/positron and $p/$He\nspectral anomalies. Most of the CR models use diffusive propagation that is\ninaccurate for weakly scattered energetic particles. So, some parts of the\nspectra affected by the heliospheric modulation, for example, cannot be\ninterpreted. I discuss and adopt an exact solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation arXiv1610.01584, which gives a complete description of a ballistic,\ndiffusive and transdiffusive (intermediate between the first two) propagation\nregimes. I derive a simplified version of an exact Fokker-Planck propagator\nthat can easily be employed in place of the Gaussian propagator, currently used\nin major Solar modulation and other CR transport models.\n", "  We study an eigenvalue problem for a spin matrix arising in the Pauli\nLubanski vector operator. Entanglement of the eigenvectors and its connection\nwith degeneracy is discussed.\n", "  We describe a novel approach for computing wave correlation functions inside\nfinite spatial domains driven by complex and statistical sources. By exploiting\nsemiclassical approximations, we provide explicit algorithms to calculate the\nlocal mean of these correlation functions in terms of the underlying classical\ndynamics. By defining appropriate ensemble averages, we show that fluctuations\nabout the mean can be characterised in terms of classical correlations. We give\nin particular an explicit expression relating fluctuations of diagonal\ncontributions to those of the full wave correlation function. The methods have\na wide range of applications both in quantum mechanics and for classical wave\nproblems such as in vibro-acoustics and electromagnetism. We apply the methods\nhere to simple quantum systems, so-called quantum maps, which model the\nbehaviour of generic problems on Poincar\\'e sections. Although low-dimensional,\nthese models exhibit a chaotic classical limit and share common characteristics\nwith wave propagation in complex structures.\n", "  We report the operation of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) capable of\nproducing gigawatt peak-power laser pulses with tunable wavelength in either\nthe visible or near-infrared spectrum. The OPA has two distinct operation modes\n(i) generation of >350 uJ, sub 100 fs pulses, tunable between 1250 - 1550 nm;\n(ii) generation of >190 uJ, sub 150 fs pulses tunable between 490 - 530 nm. We\nhave recorded high-order harmonic spectra over a wide range of driving\nwavelengths. This flexible source of femtosecond pulses presents a useful tool\nfor exploring the wavelength-dependence of strong-field phenomena, in both the\nmulti-photon and tunnel ionization regimes.\n", "  Extended-MHD modeling of DIII-D tokamak [J. L. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614\n(2002)] quiescent H-mode (QH-mode) discharges with nonlinear NIMROD [C. R.\nSovinec et al., J. Comput. Phys. 195, 355 (2004)] simulations saturates into a\nturbulent state but does not saturate when the steady-state flow inferred from\nmeasurements is not included. This is consistent with the experimental\nobservations of the quiescent regime on DIII-D. The simulation with flow\ndevelops into a saturated turbulent state where the n=1 and 2 toroidal modes\nbecome dominant through an inverse cascade. Each mode in the range of n=1-5 is\ndominant at a different time. Consistent with experimental observations during\nQH-mode, the simulated state leads to large particle transport relative to the\nthermal transport. Analysis shows that the amplitude and phase of the density\nand temperature perturbations differ resulting in greater fluctuation-induced\nconvective particle transport relative to the convective thermal transport.\nComparison to magnetic-coil measurements shows that rotation frequencies differ\nbetween the simulation and experiment, which indicates that more sophisticated\nextended-MHD two-fluid modeling is required.\n", "  Explaining the unexpected presence of dune-like patterns at the surface of\nthe comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko requires conceptual and quantitative\nadvances in the understanding of surface and outgassing processes. We show here\nthat vapor flow emitted by the comet around its perihelion spreads laterally in\na surface layer, due to the strong pressure difference between zones\nilluminated by sunlight and those in shadow. For such thermal winds to be dense\nenough to transport grains -- ten times greater than previous estimates --\noutgassing must take place through a surface porous granular layer, and that\nlayer must be composed of grains whose roughness lowers cohesion consistently\nwith contact mechanics. The linear stability analysis of the problem, entirely\ntested against laboratory experiments, quantitatively predicts the emergence of\nbedforms in the observed wavelength range, and their propagation at the scale\nof a comet revolution. Although generated by a rarefied atmosphere, they are\nparadoxically analogous to ripples emerging on granular beds submitted to\nviscous shear flows. This quantitative agreement shows that our understanding\nof the coupling between hydrodynamics and sediment transport is able to account\nfor bedform emergence in extreme conditions and provides a reliable tool to\npredict the erosion and accretion processes controlling the evolution of small\nsolar system bodies.\n", "  Van der Waals heterojunctions between two-dimensional (2D) layered materials\nand nanomaterials of different dimensions present unique opportunities for\ngate-tunable optoelectronic devices. Mixed dimensional p-n heterojunction\ndiodes, such as p-type pentacene (0D) and n-type monolayer MoS2 (2D), are\nespecially interesting for photovoltaic applications where the absorption\ncross-section and charge transfer processes can be tailored by rational\nselection from the vast library of organic molecules and 2D materials. Here, we\nstudy the kinetics of excited carriers in pentacene-MoS2 p-n type-II\nheterojunctions by transient absorption spectroscopy. These measurements show\nthat the dissociation of MoS2 excitons occurs by hole transfer to pentacene on\nthe time scale of 6.7 ps. In addition, the charge-separated state lives for 5.1\nns, up to an order of magnitude longer than the recombination lifetimes from\npreviously reported 2D material heterojunctions. By studying the fractional\namplitudes of the MoS2 decay processes, the hole transfer yield from MoS2 to\npentacene is found to be approximately 50 percent, with the remaining holes\nundergoing trapping due to surface defects. Overall, the ultrafast charge\ntransfer and long-lived charge-separated state in pentacene-MoS2 p-n\nheterojunctions suggest significant promise for mixed-dimensional van der Waals\nheterostructures in photovoltaics, photodetectors, and related optoelectronic\ntechnologies.\n", "  Here we report on a set of programs developed at the ZMBH Bio-Imaging\nFacility for tracking real-life images of cellular processes. These programs\nperform 1) automated tracking; 2) quantitative and comparative track analyses\nof different images in different groups; 3) different interactive visualization\nschemes; and 4) interactive realistic simulation of different cellular\nprocesses for validation and optimal problem-specific adjustment of image\nacquisition parameters (tradeoff between speed, resolution, and quality with\nfeedback from the very final results). The collection of programs is primarily\ndeveloped for the common bio-image analysis software ImageJ (as a single Java\nPlugin). Some programs are also available in other languages (C++ and\nJavascript) and may be run simply with a web-browser; even on a low-end Tablet\nor Smartphone. The programs are available at\nhttps://github.com/nurlicht/CellulyzerDemo\n", "  Ferroelectric domain walls are nm-sized interfaces between sections of\ndifferent allowed values of the spontaneous polarization, the so-called\ndomains. These walls - neutral or charged - can be created, displaced, deleted,\nand recreated again in ferroelectric materials. [1-3] Owing to the recent\nprogress in the studies of ferroelectrics, they are expected to be functional\nactive elements of the future nano-electronics.[1,4,5] Metallic-like\nconductivity of charged domain walls (CDWs) in insulating ferroelectrics,\npredicted in 1970s6 and detected recently,[7-10] is especially attractive for\napplications. This important effect is still in its infancy. The electric\ncurrents are small, the access to the conductivity is hampered by contact\nbarriers, and stability is low because of sophisticated domain structures\nand/or proximity of the Curie point. Here, we report on giant and accessible\npersistent CDW conductivity in lithium niobate (LN) crystals (LiNbO3) - a vital\nmaterial for photonics. [12] Our results are by far superior to the data known\nfor other materials: Increase of LN conductivity by more than 14 orders of\nmagnitude owing to CDWs, access to the effect via Ohmic and semi-Ohmic\ncontacts, and its high stability for temperatures of up to 70 {\\deg}C are\ndemonstrated. It is made clear why this big effect was missed earlier [11,25]\nin LN. Our results demonstrate that strong conductivity of CDWs is available in\nsimple ferroelectric materials, possessing only two allowed orientations of the\nspontaneous polarization, far from the Curie point. Also, CDW functionalities\ncan be combined with linear and nonlinear optical phenomena. [14,15] Our\nfindings allow new generations of adaptive-optical elements, of electrically\ncontrolled integrated-optical chips for quantum photonics, and of advanced\nLN-semiconductor hybrid optoelectronic devices.\n", "  Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) are intriguing platforms for designing\nfunctional molecular materials. Here, we present a computational study based on\nvan der Waals dispersion-corrected hybrid density functional theory\ncalculations to analyze the material properties of boroxine-linked and\ntriazine-linked intercalated-COFs. The effect of Fe atoms on the electronic\nband structures near the Fermi energy level of the intercalated-COFs have been\ninvestigated. The density of states (DOSs) computations have been performed to\nanalyze the material properties of these kind of intercalated-COFs. We predict\nthat COFs's electronic properties can be fine tuned by adding Fe atoms between\ntwo organic layers in their structures. The new COFs are predicted to be\nthermoelectric materials. These intercalated-COFs provide a new strategy to\ncreate thermoelectric materials within a rigid porous network in a highly\ncontrolled and predictable manner.\n", "  Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) are affordable photodetectors, capable\nto collect extremely fast low-energy events, due to their single-photon\nsensibility. This makes them very suitable for time-of-flight-based range\nimaging systems, allowing to reduce costs and power requirements, without\nsacrifizing much temporal resolution. In this work we describe a computational\nmodel to simulate the behaviour of SPAD sensors, aiming to provide a realistic\ncamera model for time-resolved light transport simulation, with applications on\nprototyping new reconstructions techniques based on SPAD time-of-flight data.\nOur model accounts for the major effects of the sensor on the incoming signal.\nWe compare our model against real-world measurements, and apply it to a variety\nof scenarios, including complex multiply-scattered light transport.\n", "  Published reflectance data covering several different wavelength intervals\nhas been combined and analyzed in order to determine the spherical bolometric\nalbedo of Mercury. The resulting value of 0.088 +/- 0.003 spans wavelengths\nfrom 0 to 4 {\\mu}m which includes over 99% of the solar flux. This bolometric\nresult is greater than the value determined between 0.43 and 1.01 {\\mu}m by\nDomingue et al. (2011, Planet. Space Sci., 59, 1853-1872). The difference is\ndue to higher reflectivity at wavelengths beyond 1.01 {\\mu}m. The average\neffective blackbody temperature of Mercury corresponding to the newly\ndetermined albedo is 436.3 K. This temperature takes into account the\neccentricity of the planet's orbit (M\\'endez and Rivera-Valet\\'in. 2017. ApJL,\n837, L1).\n", "  In this work we have presented current understanding of\nneutrino-nucleon/nucleus cross sections in the few GeV energy region relevant\nfor a precise determination of neutrino oscillation parameters and CP violation\nin the leptonic sector. In this energy region various processes like\nquasielastic and inelastic production of single and multipion production,\ncoherent pion production, kaon, eta, hyperon production, associated particle\nproduction as well as deep inelastic scattering processes contribute to the\nneutrino event rates.\n", "  The relation between the polar structural instability and superconductivity\nin a Weyl semimetal candidate MoTe2 has been clarified by finely controlled\nphysical and chemical pressure. The physical pressure as well as the chemical\npressure, i.e., the Se substitution for Te, enhances the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc at around the critical pressure where the polar\nstructure transition disappears. From the heat capacity and thermopower\nmeasurements, we ascribe the significant enhancement of Tc at the critical\npressure to a subtle modification of the phonon dispersion or the semimetallic\nband structure upon the polar-to-nonpolar transition. On the other hand, the\nphysical pressure, which strongly reduces the interlayer distance, is more\neffective on the suppression of the polar structural transition and the\nenhancement of Tc as compared with the chemical pressure, which emphasizes the\nimportance of the interlayer coupling on the structural and superconducting\ninstability in MoTe2.\n", "  The novel ferroelectric-like structural transition observed in metallic\nLiOsO$_3$ [Y. Shi et al., Nat. Mater. 12, 1024 (2013)], has invoked many\ntheoretical and experimental interests. In this work, we have performed\npolarized and temperature-dependent Raman scattering measurements on\nhigh-quality single crystal LiOsO$_3$ and identified Raman-active modes in both\ncentrosymmetric phase (300 K, R$\\bar{3}$c) and non-centrosymmetric phase (10 K,\nR3c). Only four phonon peaks are observed in the former phase, while there are\ntwelve peaks in the latter phase because of the reduction of crystal symmetry.\nWith the help of careful symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations,\nwe can make a systematic assignment for the observed Raman modes in both\nphases. The significant changes in line-width and the continuous evolution of\nRaman frequencies with temperatures were observed for the E$_g$ modes around\nthe transition temperature, which suggests that the ferroelectric-like\nstructural transition is a continuous order-disorder transition. The result\nsheds light on the coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity in the\ncompound.\n", "  We have performed polarized and temperature-dependent Raman scattering\nmeasurements on extremely large magnetoresitance compounds TaAs$_2$ and\nNbAs$_2$. In both crystals, all the Raman active modes, including six A$_g$\nmodes and three B$_g$ modes, are clearly observed and well assigned with the\ncombination of symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. The\nwell-resolved periodic intensity modulations of the observed modes with\nrotating crystal orientations, verify the symmetry of each assigned mode and\nare fitted to experimentally determine the elements of Raman tensor matrixes.\nThe broadening of two A$_g$ modes seen in both compounds allows us to estimate\nelectron-phonon coupling constant, which suggests a relatively small\nelectron-phonon coupling in the semimetals TaAs$_2$ and NbAs$_2$. The present\nstudy provides the fundamental lattice dynamics information on TaAs$_2$ and\nNbAs$_2$ and may shed light on the understanding of their extraordinary large\nmagnetoresistance.\n", "  Dirac materials exhibit intriguing low-energy carrier dynamics that offer a\nfertile ground for novel physics discovery. Of particular interest is the\ninterplay of Dirac carriers with other quantum phenomena, such as magnetism.\nHere we report on a two-magnon Raman scattering study of AMnBi2 (A=Ca, Sr), a\nprototypical magnetic Dirac system comprising alternating Dirac-carrier and\nmagnetic layers. We present the first accurate determination of the exchange\nenergies in these compounds and, by comparison to the reference compound\nBaMn2Bi2, we show that the Dirac-carrier layers in AMnBi2 significantly enhance\nthe exchange coupling between the magnetic layers, which in turn drives a\ncharge-gap opening along the Dirac locus. Our findings break new grounds in\nunveiling the fundamental physics of magnetic Dirac materials, which offer a\nnovel platform for probing a distinct type of spin-Fermion interaction. The\noutstanding properties of these materials allow a delicate manipulation of the\ninteraction between the Dirac carriers and magnetic moments, thus holding great\npromise for applications in magnetic Dirac devices.\n", "  We analyze the security of the two-way continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution protocol in reverse reconciliation against general two-mode\nattacks, which represent all accessible attacks at fixed channel parameters.\nRather than against one specific attack model, the expression of secret key\nrates of the two-way protocol are derived against all accessible attack models.\nIt is found that there is an optimal two-mode attack to minimize the\nperformance of the protocol in terms of both secret key rates and maximal\ntransmission distances. We identify the optimal two-mode attack, give the\nspecific attack model of the optimal two-mode attack and show the performance\nof the two-way protocol against the optimal two-mode attack. Even under the\noptimal two-mode attack, the performances of two-way protocol are still better\nthan the corresponding one-way protocol, which shows the advantage of making a\ndouble use of the quantum channel and the potential of long-distance secure\ncommunication using two-way protocol.\n", "  In this paper, a new type magnet is proposed and processed to uniform the\ntransverse beam profile. Compeared to the octupole, the new type magnet can\nprove a similar octupole magnet field in the middle, but the rise rate declines\nquickly in the edge. So that, a same uniform beam is got with less particles\nloss. Besides that, a mechanical structure is added to adjust the width of the\nmiddle region to satisfy different transverse dimensions, and this whould\nfurther reduce particles loss. Some numerical simulations have been done\nrespectively with the octupole and the new type of magnet to show the\nadvantages of the new type magnet.\n", "  Coherence is the most fundamental quantum feature in quantum mechanics. For a\nbipartite quantum state, if a measurement is performed on one party, the other\nparty, based on the measurement outcomes, will collapse to a corresponding\nstate with some probability and hence gain the average coherence. It is shown\nthat the average coherence is not less than the coherence of its reduced\ndensity matrix. In particular, it is very surprising that the extra average\ncoherence (and the maximal extra average coherence with all the possible\nmeasurements taken into account) is upper bounded by the classical correlation\nof the bipartite state instead of the quantum correlation. We also find the\nsufficient and necessary condition for the null maximal extra average\ncoherence. Some examples demonstrate the relation and, moreover, show that\nquantum correlation is neither sufficient nor necessary for the nonzero extra\naverage coherence within a given measurement. In addition, the similar\nconclusions are drawn for both the basis-dependent and the basis-free coherence\nmeasure.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate vortex dynamics in a two-dimensional\nBose-Hubbard model coupled with a weak artificial magnetic field, a random\nwhite noise and a dissipation. Origin of the noise and dissipation is\nconsidered as thermal fluctuations of atoms that do not participate the\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Solving a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation to this system, we show that the interplay of the magnetic field and\nthe white noise generates vortices in the bulk of the BEC and stable steady\nstates of vortices form after a transition period. We calculate the\nincompressible part of the kinetic-energy spectrum of the BEC. In the\ntransition period, a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum appears in the infrared\nregime with the wave number $k$, $k<\\zeta^{-1}$, where $\\zeta$ is the healing\nlength, whereas in the ultraviolet region, $k>\\zeta^{-1}$, the spectrum behaves\nas $k^{-3}$. On the other hand in the steady states, another scaling low\nappears. We find a relationship between the above mentioned kinetic-energy\nspectra and the velocity of vortices. By an inverse cascade, the large velocity\nof a few created vortices develops the Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ spectrum.\n", "  We study the relaxation of a single electron spin in a circular quantum dot\nin a transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayer defined by electrostatic gating.\nTransition-metal dichalcogenides provide an interesting and promising arena for\nquantum dot nano-structures due to the combination of a band gap, spin-valley\nphysics and strong spin-orbit coupling. First we will discuss which bound state\nsolutions in different B-field regimes can be used as the basis for qubits\nstates. We find that at low B-fields combined spin-valley Kramers qubits to be\nsuitable, while at large magnetic fields pure spin or valley qubits can be\nenvisioned. Then we present a discussion of the relaxation of a single electron\nspin mediated by electron-phonon interaction via various different relaxation\nchannels. In the low B-field regime we consider the spin-valley Kramers qubits\nand include impurity mediated valley mixing which will arise in disordered\nquantum dots. Rashba spin-orbit admixture mechanisms allows for relaxation by\nin-plane phonons either via the deformation potential or by piezoelectric\ncoupling, additionally direct spin-phonon mechanisms involving out-of-plane\nphonons give rise to relaxation. We find that the relaxation rates scale as\n$\\propto B^6$ for both in-plane phonons coupling via deformation potential and\nthe piezoelectric effect, while relaxation due to the direct spin-phonon\ncoupling scales independant to B-field to lowest order but scales strongly on\ndevice mechanical tension. We will also discuss the relaxation mechanisms for\npure spin or valley qubits formed in the large B-field regime.\n", "  Templates can be used to describe the topological properties of chaotic\nattractors. For attractors bounded by genus one torus, these templates are\ndescribed by a linking matrix. For a given attractor, it has been shown that\nthe template depends on the Poincar\\'e section chosen to performed the\nanalysis. The purpose of this article is to present an algorithm that gives the\nelementary mixer of a template in order to have a unique way to describe a\nchaotic mechanism. This chaotic mechanism is described with a linking matrix\nand we also provide a method to generate and classify all the possible chaotic\nmechanisms made of two to five strips.\n", "  In the present paper, using a replica analysis, we examine the portfolio\noptimization problem handled in previous work and discuss the minimization of\ninvestment risk under constraints of budget and expected return for the case\nthat the distribution of the hyperparameters of the mean and variance of the\nreturn rate of each asset are not limited to a specific probability family.\nFindings derived using our proposed method are compared with those in previous\nwork to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. Further, we derive a\nPythagorean theorem of the Sharpe ratio and macroscopic relations of\nopportunity loss. Using numerical experiments, the effectiveness of our\nproposed method is demonstrated for a specific situation.\n", "  Full-dimensional semiclassical dynamical calculations are reported for the\nphotofragmentation of isocyanic acid in the S1 state. These calculations,\nperformed for the first time, allow to closely reproduce the key features of\nhigh-resolution imaging measurements at photolysis wavelengths of 201 and 210\nnm while providing insight into the underlying dissociation mechanism.\n", "  Heckman introduced $N$ operators on the space of polynomials in $N$\nvariables, such that these operators form a covariant set relative to\npermutations of the operators and variables, and such that Jack symmetric\npolynomials are eigenfunctions of the power sums of these operators. We\nintroduce the analogues of these $N$ operators for Macdonald symmetric\npolynomials, by using Cherednik operators. The latter operators pairwise\ncommute, and Macdonald polynomials are eigenfunctions of their power sums. We\ncompute the limits of our operators at $N\\to\\infty$. These limits yield the\nsame Lax operator for Macdonald symmetric functions as constructed in our\nprevious work.\n", "  When measuring quadratic values representative of random fluctuations, such\nas the thermal noise of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilevers, the\nbackground measurement noise cannot be averaged to zero. We present a signal\nprocessing method that allows to get rid of this limitation using the\nubiquitous optical beam deflection sensor of standard AFMs. We demonstrate a\ntwo orders of magnitude enhancement of the signal to noise ratio in our\nexperiment, allowing the calibration of stiff cantilevers or easy\nidentification of higher order modes from thermal noise measurements.\n", "  Purpose: To investigate the effect of realistic microstructural geometry on\nthe susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal in white matter\n(WM), with application to demyelination.\n  Methods: Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the\nassumption that axons are cylindrical. In this work, we explore the\nimplications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic\ngeometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties\nbased on literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were\nmodeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested\ncircles, warped/elliptical circles and measured axonal geometries from electron\nmicrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries\nwere compared to measured signals from a Cuprizone mouse model with varying\ndegrees of demyelination.\n  Results: Results from simulation suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR\nsignal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared\nto circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for\nsimulations with and without diffusion.\n  Conclusion: The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly.\nLiterature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting\nbiophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed\ngeometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.\n", "  We have studied the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency\n(EIT) of 87Rb vapor with a buffer gas in a magnetic field at room temperature.\nIt is found that the spectral lines caused by the velocity selective optical\npump effects get much weaker and wider when the sample cell mixed with a 5-Torr\nN2 gas while the EIT signal kept almost unchanged. A weighted least-square fit\nis also developed to remove the Doppler broadening completely. This spectral\nmethod provides a way to measure the Zeeman splitting with high resolution, for\nexample, the {\\Lambda}-type EIT resonance splits into four peaks on the D2 line\nof 87Rb in the thermal 2-cm vapor cell with a magnetic field along the electric\nfield of the linearly polarized coupling laser. The high resolution spectrum\ncan be used to lock the laser to a given frequency by tuning the magnetic\nfield.\n", "  A temporal graph is a data structure, consisting of nodes and edges in which\nthe edges are associated with time labels. To analyze the temporal graph, the\nfirst step is to find a proper graph dataset/benchmark. While many temporal\ngraph datasets exist online, none could be found that used the interval labels\nin which each edge is associated with a starting and ending time. Therefore we\ncreate a temporal graph data based on Wikipedia reference graph for temporal\nanalysis. This report aims to provide more details of this graph benchmark to\nthose who are interested in using it.\n", "  Based on the assumption that economic complexity is characterised by the\ninteractions of economic agents (who) constantly change their actions and\nstrategies in response to the outcome they mutually create, this paper presents\nhow network models can be used a proxies for the mapping, quantification and\nanalysis of Roman economic complexity. Network analysis provides tools to\nvisualise and analyse the inherent complexity of various types of data and\ntheir combination (archaeological, geographical, textual) or even of a single\npiece of evidence. Equally, the relational approach invites to a structural and\nquantitative comparison between periods, regions and the economic systems of\npolities and empires. An increasing number of proxies of this kind may allow us\nto capture the trajectories of economic complexity beyond metaphors.\n", "  Researchers interested in statistically modeling network data have a\nwell-established and quickly growing set of approaches from which to choose.\nSeveral of these methods have been regularly applied in research on political\nnetworks, while others have yet to permeate the field. Here, we review the most\nprominent methods of inferential network analysis---both for cross-sectionally\nand longitudinally observed networks including (temporal) exponential random\ngraph models, latent space models, the quadratic assignment procedure, and\nstochastic actor oriented models. For each method, we summarize its analytic\nform, identify prominent published applications in political science and\ndiscuss computational considerations. We conclude with a set of guidelines for\nselecting a method for a given application.\n", "  We first recall some basic facts from the theory of discrete-time Markov\nchains arising from two types neutral and non-neutral evolution models of\npopulation genetics with constant size. We then define and analyse a version of\nsuch models whose fluctuating total population size is conserved on average\nonly. In our model, the population of interest is seen as being embedded in a\nframe process which is a critical Galton-Watson process. In this context, we\naddress problems such as extinction, fixation, size of the population at\nfixation and survival probability to a bottleneck effect of the environment.\nRunning title: constant population size on average\n", "  A principle on the macroscopic motion of systems in thermodynamic\nequilibrium, rarely discussed in texts, is reviewed: Very small but still\nmacroscopic parts of a fully isolated system in thermal equilibrium move as if\npoints of a rigid body, macroscopic energy being dissipated to increase\ninternal energy, and increase entropy along. It appears particularly important\nin Space physics, when dissipation involves long-range fields at\nElectromagnetism and Gravitation, rather than short-range contact forces. It is\nshown how new physics, Special Relativity as regards Electromagnetism, first\nNewtonian theory then General Relativity as regards Gravitation, determine\ndifferent dissipative processes involved in the approach to that equilibrium.\n", "  Categorization is necessary for many decision making tasks. However, the\ncategorization process may interfere the decision making result and the law of\ntotal probability can be violated in some situations. To predict the\ninterference effect of categorization, some model based on quantum probability\nhas been proposed. In this paper, a new quantum dynamic belief (QDB) model is\nproposed. Considering the precise decision may not be made during the process,\nthe concept of uncertainty is introduced in our model to simulate real human\nthinking process. Then the interference effect categorization can be predicted\nby handling the uncertain information. The proposed model is applied to a\ncategorization decision-making experiment to explain the interference effect of\ncategorization. Compared with other models, our model is relatively more\nsuccinct and the result shows the correctness and effectiveness of our model.\n", "  In contrast to the gaseous and the solid states, the liquid state does not\nhave a simple model that could be developed into a quantitative theory. A\ncentral issue in the understanding of liquids is to estimate the energy state\nof liquids. Here, on the basis of our recent studies on crystal melting, we\nshow that the energy sate of liquids may be reasonably approximated by the\nenergy and volume of a vacancy. Consequently, estimation of the liquid state\nenergy is significantly simplified comparing with previous methods that\ninevitably invoke many-body interactions. Accordingly, a possible equation of\nstate for liquids is proposed. On this basis, it seems that a simple model for\nliquids is in sight.\n", "  A new method for the measurement of sample reactivity worth in a fast neutron\nreactor named the inverse kinetics method is proposed in the paper. The sample\nreactivity worth could be obtained by measuring the reactivity step change in\nthe process of sample fetching and placing in the delayed critical reactor.\nCompared with the traditional period method, the advantage is that the accuracy\nof reactor reactivity control will not exert any influence on the uncertainty\nof reactivity worth measurement. The inverse kinetics method has been used to\nmeasure the reactivity worth of {\\phi}20mmx9mm Au, V and Be samples at the\ncenter of the upper surface of a highly enriched uranium fast neutron reactor,\nand the results are 5.17, 4.40 and 5.90 respectively, which are consistent with\nthose obtained with the period method. The standard uncertainty of measurement\nof the results is about 0.03, which achieves an obvious improvement compared\nwith that (~0.08) of the period method.\n", "  This study extended research on the development of explanatory labels for\nastronomical images for the non-expert lay public. The research questions\naddressed how labels with leading questions/metaphors and relevance to everyday\nlife affect comprehension of the intended message for deep space images, the\ndesire to learn more, and the aesthetic appreciation of images. Participants\nwere a convenience sample of 1,921 respondents solicited from a variety of\nwebsites and through social media who completed an online survey that used four\nhigh-resolution images as stimuli: Sagittarius A*, Solar Flare, Cassiopeia A,\nand the Pinwheel Galaxy (M101). Participants were randomly assigned initially\nto 1 of 3 label conditions: the standard label originally written for the\nimage, a label with a leading question containing a metaphor related to the\ninformation for the image, or a label that contained a fact about the image\nrelevant to everyday life. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 image and\ncompared all labels for that image. Open-ended items at various points asked\nparticipants to pose questions to a hypothetical astronomer. Main findings were\nthat the relevance condition was significantly more likely to increase wanting\nto learn more; the original label was most likely to increase overall\nappreciation; and, smart phone users were more likely to want to learn more and\nreport increased levels of appreciation. Results are discussed in terms of the\nneed to examine individual viewer characteristics and goals in creating\ndifferent labels for different audiences.\n", "  Quantum state separation is a probabilistic map that transforms a given set\nof pure states into another set of more distinguishable ones. Here we\ninvestigate such a map acting onto uniparametric families of symmetric linearly\ndependent or independent quantum states. We obtained analytical solutions for\nthe success probability of the maps--which is shown to be optimal--as well as\nexplicit constructions in terms of positive operator valued measures. Our\nresults can be used for state discrimination strategies interpolating\ncontinuously between minimum-error and unambiguous (or maximum-confidence)\ndiscrimination, which, in turn, have many applications in quantum information\nprotocols. As an example, we show that quantum teleportation through a\nnonmaximally entangled quantum channel can be accomplished with higher\nprobability than the one provided by unambiguous (or maximum-confidence)\ndiscrimination and with higher fidelity than the one achievable by\nminimum-error discrimination. Finally, an optical network is proposed for\nimplementing parametric state separation.\n", "  We derive a fixed-point formula for integrals on moduli spaces of stable maps\nto projective spaces of even dimension. This gives a formula for the\nequivariant open Gromov-Witten invariants of (RP^{2m},CP^{2m}) and the\nstructure constants of the equivariant Fukaya A-infinity algebra of RP^2m in\nCP^{2m} with bulk deformations. The formula involves contributions from\nGivental's correlators for the closed theory and the descendent integrals of\ndiscs, and specializes to give a new expression for the Welschinger count of\nreal rational curves in the plane passing through some real and conjugation\ninvariant pairs of points.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a novel community detection algorithm in graphs,\ncalled SCoDA (Streaming Community Detection Algorithm), based on an edge\nstreaming setting. This algorithm has an extremely low memory footprint and a\nlightning-fast execution time as it only stores two integers per node and\nprocesses each edge strictly once. The approach is based on the following\nsimple observation: if we pick an edge uniformly at random in the network, this\nedge is more likely to connect two nodes of the same community than two nodes\nof distinct communities. We exploit this idea to build communities by local\nchanges at each edge arrival. Using theoretical arguments, we relate the\nability of SCoDA to detect communities to usual quality metrics of these\ncommunities like the conductance. Experimental results performed on massive\nreal-life networks ranging from one million to more than one billion edges\nshows that SCoDA runs more than ten times faster than existing algorithms and\nleads to similar or better detection scores on the largest graphs.\n", "  Quantum mechanics forbids perfect discrimination among nonorthogonal states\nthrough a single shot measurement. To optimize this task, many strategies were\ndevised that later became fundamental tools for quantum information processing.\nHere, we address the pioneering minimum-error (ME) measurement and give the\nfirst experimental demonstration of its application for discriminating\nnonorthogonal states in high dimensions. Our scheme is designed to distinguish\nsymmetric pure states encoded in the transverse spatial modes of an optical\nfield; the optimal measurement is performed by a projection onto the Fourier\ntransform basis of these modes. For dimensions ranging from D = 2 to D = 21 and\nnearly 14000 states tested, the deviations of the experimental results from the\ntheoretical values range from 0.3% to 3.6% (getting below 2% for the vast\nmajority), thus showing the excellent performance of our scheme. This ME\nmeasurement is a building block for high-dimensional implementations of many\nquantum communication protocols, including probabilistic state discrimination,\ndense coding with nonmaximal entanglement, and cryptographic schemes.\n", "  We describe the Kerr black hole in the ingoing and outgoing Kerr-Schild\nhorizon penetrating coordinates. Starting from the null vector naturally\ndefined in these coordinates, we construct the null tetrad for each case, as\nwell as the corresponding geometrical quantities allowing us to explicitly\nderive the field equations for the ${\\Psi_0}^{(1)}$ and ${\\Psi_4}^{(1)}$\nperturbed scalar projections of the Weyl tensor, including arbitrary source\nterms. This perturbative description, including arbitrary sources, described in\nhorizon penetrating coordinates is desirable in several lines of research on\nblack holes, and contributes to the implementation of a formalism aimed to\nstudy the evolution of the space time in the region where two black holes are\nclose.\n"]}
