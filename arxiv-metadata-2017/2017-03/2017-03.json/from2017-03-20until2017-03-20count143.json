The\nmain result of this work corresponds to the obtation of a usual\nChern-Simons-type action in four-dimensional spacetime resulting from the\naddition to the conventional QED Lagrangian of a term with a background field\nthat breaks the Lorentz symmetry of the Lagrangian gauge theory. It is pointed\nout that the proportionality constant in that term depends heavily on the\nregularization method used in the computations. As the articles on this subject\nin the literature are very difficult to read, here calculations are performed\nclearly and objectively.\n", "  We develop a method for computing form factors of local operators in the\nframework of Sklyanin's separation of variables (SOV) approach to quantum\nintegrable systems. For that purpose, we consider the sine-Gordon model on a\nfinite lattice and in finite dimensional cyclic representations as our main\nexample. We first build our two central tools for computing matrix elements of\nlocal operators, namely, a generic determinant formula for the scalar products\nof states in the SOV framework and the reconstruction of local fields in terms\nof the separate variables. The general form factors are then obtained as sums\nof determinants of finite dimensional matrices, their matrix elements being\ngiven as weighted sums running over the separate variables and involving the\nBaxter Q-operator eigenvalues.\n", "  We investigate the Boltzmann equation, depending on the Knudsen number, in\nthe Navier-Stokes perturbative setting on the torus. Using hypocoercivity, we\nderive a new proof of existence and exponential decay for solutions close to a\nglobal equilibrium, with explicit regularity bounds and rates of convergence.\nThese results are uniform in the Knudsen number and thus allow us to obtain a\nstrong derivation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as the Knudsen\nnumber tends to $0$. Moreover, our method is also used to deal with other\nkinetic models. Finally, we show that the study of the hydrodynamical limit is\nrather different on the torus than the one already proved in the whole space as\nit requires averaging in time, unless the initial layer conditions are\nsatisfied.\n", "  We present electrical transport measurements in natural graphite and highly\nordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), comparing macroscopic samples with\nexfoliated, nanofabricated specimens of nanometer thickness. The latter exhibit\na very large c-axis resistivity $\\rho_c$ -- much larger than expected from\nsimple band theory -- and non-monotonic temperature dependence, similar to\nmacroscopic HOPG, but in stark contrast to macroscopic natural graphite. A\nrecent model of disorder-induced delocalization is consistent with our\ntransport data. Furthermore, Micro-Raman spectroscopy reveals clearly reduced\ndisorder in exfoliated samples and HOPG, as expected within the model --\ntherefore presenting further evidence for a novel paradigm of electronic\ntransport in graphite.\n", "  The similarity between neural and immune networks has been known for decades,\nbut so far we did not understand the mechanism that allows the immune system,\nunlike associative neural networks, to recall and execute a large number of\nmemorized defense strategies {\\em in parallel}. The explanation turns out to\nlie in the network topology. Neurons interact typically with a large number of\nother neurons, whereas interactions among lymphocytes in immune networks are\nvery specific, and described by graphs with finite connectivity. In this paper\nwe use replica techniques to solve a statistical mechanical immune network\nmodel with `coordinator branches' (T-cells) and `effector branches' (B-cells),\nand show how the finite connectivity enables the system to manage an extensive\nnumber of immune clones simultaneously, even above the percolation threshold.\nThe system exhibits only weak ergodicity breaking, so that both multiple\nantigen defense and homeostasis can be accomplished.\n", "  The nuSTORM facility has been designed to deliver beams of electron neutrinos\nand muon neutrinos (and their anti-particles) from the decay of a stored muon\nbeam with a central momentum of 3.8 GeV/c and a momentum acceptance of 10%. The\nfacility is unique in that it will: 1. Allow searches for sterile neutrinos of\nexquisite sensitivity to be carried out; 2. Serve future long- and\nshort-baseline neutrino-oscillation programs by providing definitive\nmeasurements of electron neutrino and muon neutrino scattering cross sections\noff nuclei with percent-level precision; and 3. Constitutes the crucial first\nstep in the development of muon accelerators as a powerful new technique for\nparticle physics. The document describes the facility in detail and\ndemonstrates its physics capabilities. This document was submitted to the\nFermilab Physics Advisory Committee in consideration for Stage I approval.\n", "  We introduce two variants of the information spectrum relative entropy\ndefined by Tomamichel and Hayashi which have the particular advantage of\nsatisfying the data-processing inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum\noperations. This property allows us to obtain one-shot bounds for various\ninformation-processing tasks in terms of these quantities. Moreover, these\nrelative entropies have a second order asymptotic expansion, which in turn\nyields tight second order asymptotics for optimal rates of these tasks in the\ni.i.d. setting. The tasks studied in this paper are fixed-length quantum source\ncoding, noisy dense coding, entanglement concentration, pure-state entanglement\ndilution, and transmission of information through a classical-quantum channel.\nIn the latter case, we retrieve the second order asymptotics obtained by\nTomamichel and Tan. Our results also yield the known second order asymptotics\nof fixed-length classical source coding derived by Hayashi. The second order\nasymptotics of entanglement concentration and dilution provide a refinement of\nthe inefficiency of these protocols - a quantity which, in the case of\nentanglement dilution, was studied by Harrow and Lo. We prove how the\ndiscrepancy between the optimal rates of these two processes in the second\norder implies the irreversibility of entanglement concentration established by\nKumagai and Hayashi. In addition, the spectral divergence rates of the\nInformation Spectrum Approach (ISA) can be retrieved from our relative\nentropies in the asymptotic limit. This enables us to directly obtain the more\ngeneral results of the ISA from our one-shot bounds.\n", "  A century after the advent of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, both\ntheories enjoy incredible empirical success, constituting the cornerstones of\nmodern physics. Yet, paradoxically, they suffer from deep-rooted, so-far\nintractable, conflicts. Motivations for violations of the notion of\nrelativistic locality include the Bell's inequalities for hidden variable\ntheories, the cosmological horizon problem, and Lorentz-violating approaches to\nquantum geometrodynamics, such as Horava-Lifshitz gravity. Here, we explore a\nrecent proposal for a \"real ensemble\" non-local description of quantum\nmechanics, in which \"particles\" can copy each others' observable values AND\nphases, independent of their spatial separation. We first specify the exact\ntheory, ensuring that it is consistent and has (ordinary) quantum mechanics as\na fixed point, where all particles with the same values for a given observable\nhave the same phases. We then study the stability of this fixed point\nnumerically, and analytically, for simple models. We provide evidence that most\nsystems (in our study) are locally stable to small deviations from quantum\nmechanics, and furthermore, the phase variance per value of the observable, as\nwell as systematic deviations from quantum mechanics, decay as $\\sim$\n(Energy$\\times$Time)$^{-2n}$, where $n \\geq 1$. Interestingly, this convergence\nis controlled by the absolute value of energy (and not energy difference),\nsuggesting a possible connection to gravitational physics. Finally, we discuss\ndifferent issues related to this theory, as well as potential novel\napplications for the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations and the\ncosmological constant problem.\n", "  Quantum technology promises revolutionary advantages in information\nprocessing and transmission compared to classical technology; however,\ndetermining which specific resources are needed to surpass the capabilities of\nclassical machines often remains a nontrivial problem. To address such a\nproblem, one first needs to establish the best classical solutions, which set\nbenchmarks that must be beaten by any implementation claiming to harness\nquantum features for an enhanced performance. Here we introduce and develop a\nself-contained formalism to obtain the ultimate, generally probabilistic\nbenchmarks for quantum information protocols including teleportation and\napproximate cloning, with arbitrary ensembles of input states generated by a\ngroup action, so-called Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states. This allows us to\nconstruct explicit fidelity thresholds for the transmission of multimode\nGaussian and non-Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, as well as\nqubit and qudit pure states drawn according to nonuniform distributions on the\nBloch hypersphere, which accurately model the current laboratory facilities.\nThe performance of deterministic classical procedures such as square-root\nmeasurement strategies is further compared with the optimal probabilistic\nbenchmarks, and the state-of-the-art performance of experimental quantum\nimplementations against our newly derived thresholds is discussed. This work\nprovides a comprehensive collection of directly useful criteria for the\nreliable certification of quantum communication technologies.\n", "  We propose a general notion of algebraic gauge theory obtained via extracting\nthe main properties of classical gauge theory. Building on a recent work on\ntransferring curved $A_{\\infty}$-structures we show that, under certain\ntechnical conditions, algebraic gauge theories can be transferred along chain\ncontractions. Specializing to the case of the contraction from differential\nforms to cochains, we obtain a simplicial gauge theory on the matrix-valued\nsimplicial cochains of a triangulated manifold. In particular, one obtains\ndiscrete notions of connection, curvature, gauge transformation and gauge\ninvariant action.\n", "  We show that a metric of arbitrary dimension and signature which allows for a\nstandard Wick-rotation to a Riemannian metric necessarily has a purely electric\nRiemann and Weyl tensor.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a task that we call Markovianization, in which a\ntripartite quantum state is transformed to a quantum Markov chain by a\nrandomizing operation on one of the three subsystems. We consider cases where\nthe initial state is the tensor product of $n$ copies of a tripartite state\n$\\rho^{ABC}$, and is transformed to a quantum Markov chain conditioned by $B^n$\nwith a small error, using a random unitary operation on $A^n$. In an asymptotic\nlimit of infinite copies and vanishingly small error, we analyze the\nMarkovianizing cost, that is, the minimum cost of randomness per copy required\nfor Markovianization. For tripartite pure states, we derive a single-letter\nformula for the Markovianizing costs. Counterintuitively, the Markovianizing\ncost is not a continuous function of states, and can be arbitrarily large even\nif the state is close to a quantum Markov chain. Our results have an\napplication in analyzing the cost of resources for simulating a bipartite\nunitary gate by local operations and classical communication.\n", "  Helium Ion Microscopy is known for its surface sensitivity and high lateral\nresolution. Here, we present results of a Helium Ion Microscopy based\ninvestigation of a surface confined alloy of Ag on Pt(111). Based on a change\nof the work function of 25\\,meV across the atomically flat terraces we can\ndistinguish Pt rich from Pt poor areas and visualize the single atomic layer\nhigh steps between the terraces. Furthermore, dechanneling contrast has been\nutilized to measure the periodicity of the hcp/fcc pattern formed in the 2--3\nlayers thick Ag/Pt alloy film. A periodicity of 6.65\\,nm along the\n$\\langle\\overline{11}2\\rangle$ surface direction has been measured. In terms of\ncrystallography a hcp domain is obtained through a lateral displacement of a\npart of the outermost layer by $1/\\sqrt{3}$ of a nearest neighbour spacing\nalong $\\langle\\overline{11}2\\rangle$. This periodicity is measured with atomic\nprecision: coincidence between the Ag and the Pt lattices is observed for 23 Ag\natoms on 24 Pt atoms. The findings are perfectly in line with results obtained\nwith Low Energy Electron Microscopy and Phase Contrast Atomic Force Microscopy.\n", "  Macroscopic irreversible processes emerge from fundamental physical laws of\nreversible character. The source of the local irreversibility seems to be not\nin the laws themselves but in the initial and boundary conditions of the\nequations that represent the laws. In this work we propose that the screening\nof currents by black hole event horizons determines, locally, a preferred\ndirection for the flux of electromagnetic energy. We study the growth of black\nhole event horizons due to the cosmological expansion and accretion of cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, for different cosmological models. We propose\ngeneralized McVittie co-moving metrics and integrate the rate of accretion of\ncosmic microwave background radiation onto a supermassive black hole over\ncosmic time. We find that for flat, open, and closed Friedmann cosmological\nmodels, the ratio of the total area of the black hole event horizons with\nrespect to the area of a radial co-moving space-like hypersurface always\nincreases. Since accretion of cosmic radiation sets an absolute lower limit to\nthe total matter accreted by black holes, this implies that the causal past and\nfuture are not mirror symmetric for any spacetime event. The asymmetry causes a\nnet Poynting flux in the global future direction; the latter is in turn related\nto the ever increasing thermodynamic entropy. Thus, we expose a connection\nbetween four different \"time arrows\": cosmological, electromagnetic,\ngravitational, and thermodynamic.\n", "  Abelian gauge theory in $d\\neq 4$ spacetime dimensions is an example of a\nscale invariant theory which does not possess conformal symmetry -- the special\nconformal transformation(SCT) explicitly breaks the gauge invariance of the\ntheory. In this work, we construct a non-local gauge-invariant extension of the\nSCT, which is compatible with the BRST formalism and defines a new symmetry of\nthe physical Hilbert space of the Maxwell theory for any dimension $d\\geqslant\n3$. We prove the invariance of the Maxwell theory in $d\\geqslant 3$ by\nexplicitly showing that the gauge-invariant two-point correlation functions,\nthe action, and the classical equation of motion are unchanged under such a\ntransformation.\n", "  We discuss the universal nature of relaxation in isolated many-body quantum\nsystems subjected to global and strong periodic driving. Our rigorous Floquet\nanalysis shows that the energy of the system remains almost constant up to an\nexponentially long time in frequency for arbitrary initial states and that an\neffective Hamiltonian obtained by a truncation of the Floquet-Magnus expansion\nis a quasi-conserved quantity for long time scale. These two general properties\nlead to intriguing classification on the initial stage of relaxation, one of\nwhich is similar to the prethermalization phenomenon in quasi-integrable\nsystems.\n", "  Partial polarization is the manifestation of the correlation between two\nmutually orthogonal transverse field components associated with a light beam.\nWe show both theoretically and experimentally that the origin of this\ncorrelation can be purely quantum mechanical. We perform a two-path first-order\n(single photon) interference experiment and demonstrate that the degree of\npolarization of the light emerging from the output of the interferometer\ndepends on path distinguishability. We use two independent methods to control\nthe distinguishability of the photon paths. While the distinguishability\nintroduced in one of the methods can be erased by performing a suitable\nmeasurement on the superposed beam, the distinguishability introduced in the\nother method cannot be erased. We show that the beam is partially polarized\nonly when both types of distinguishability exist. Our main result is the\ndependence of the degree of polarization on the inerasable distinguishability,\nwhich cannot be explained by the classical (non-quantum) theory of light.\n", "  Chemical reactions at ultracold temperatures are expected to be dominated by\nquantum mechanical effects. Although progress towards ultracold chemistry has\nbeen made through atomic photoassociation, Feshbach resonances and bimolecular\ncollisions, these approaches have been limited by imperfect quantum state\nselectivity. In particular, attaining complete control of the ground or excited\ncontinuum quantum states has remained a challenge. Here we achieve this control\nusing photodissociation, an approach that encodes a wealth of information in\nthe angular distribution of outgoing fragments. By photodissociating ultracold\n88Sr2 molecules with full control of the low-energy continuum, we access the\nquantum regime of ultracold chemistry, observing resonant and nonresonant\nbarrier tunneling, matter-wave interference of reaction products and forbidden\nreaction pathways. Our results illustrate the failure of the traditional\nquasiclassical model of photodissociation and instead are accurately described\nby a quantum mechanical model. The experimental ability to produce well-defined\nquantum continuum states at low energies will enable high-precision studies of\nlong-range molecular potentials for which accurate quantum chemistry models are\nunavailable, and may serve as a source of entangled states and coherent matter\nwaves for a wide range of experiments in quantum optics.\n", "  We report an efficient program for computing the eigenvalues and\nsymmetry-adapted eigenvectors of very large quaternionic (or Hermitian\nskew-Hamiltonian) matrices, using which structure-preserving diagonalization of\nmatrices of dimension N > 10000 is now routine on a single computer node. Such\nmatrices appear frequently in relativistic quantum chemistry owing to the\ntime-reversal symmetry. The implementation is based on a blocked version of the\nPaige-Van Loan algorithm [D. Kressner, BIT 43, 775 (2003)], which allows us to\nuse the Level 3 BLAS subroutines for most of the computations. Taking advantage\nof the symmetry, the program is faster by up to a factor of two than\nstate-of-the-art implementations of complex Hermitian diagonalization;\ndiagonalizing a 12800 x 12800 matrix took 42.8 (9.5) and 85.6 (12.6) minutes\nwith 1 CPU core (16 CPU cores) using our symmetry-adapted solver and Intel\nMKL's ZHEEV that is not structure-preserving, respectively. The source code is\npublicly available under the FreeBSD license.\n", "  We summarize our work on building glueball inflation models with the methods\nof the gauge/gravity duality. We review the relevant five-dimensional\nconsistent truncation of type IIB supergravity. We consider solutions of this\neffective theory, whose metric has the form of a $dS_4$ foliation over a radial\ndirection. By turning on small (in an appropriate sense) time-dependent\ndeformations around these solutions, one can build models of glueball\ninflation. We discuss a particular deformed solution, describing an ultra-slow\nroll inflationary regime.\n", "  We analytically describe the strong-field light-electron interaction using a\nquantized coherent laser state with arbitrary photon number. We obtain a\nlight-electron wave function which is a closed-form solution of the\ntime-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE). This wave function provides\ninformation about the quantum optical features of the interaction not\naccessible by semi-classical theories. With this approach we can reveal the\nquantum optical properties of high harmonic generation (HHG) process in gases\nby measuring the photon statistics of the transmitted infrared (IR) laser\nradiation. This work can lead to novel experiments in high-resolution\nspectroscopy in extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) and attosecond science without the\nneed to measure the XUV light, while it can pave the way for the development of\nintense non-classical light sources.\n", "  We present the Hawking-Page phase diagrams in the Bergshoeff-Hohm-Townsend\n(BHT) massive gravity theory for different solutions, such as the phase\ntransitions between vacuum $\\text{AdS}_3$ and BTZ black hole, warped\n$\\text{AdS}_3$ and warped BTZ black hole in grand canonical and in\nnon-local/quadratic ensembles, Lifshitz black hole and the new hairy black hole\nsolutions. We observe that except for the black holes in quadratic ensemble,\nfor other cases in the non-chiral theory of BHT the phase diagrams are\nsymmetric with respect to the direction of angular momentum, as we expected. We\nconclude that for presenting the phase diagrams of warped $\\text{AdS}_3$ black\nholes, only the grand canonical ensemble should be used.\n", "  By modelling H$^0$ column densities in eclipsing S-type symbiotic stars EG\nAnd and SY Mus, we derived the wind velocity profile and the corresponding\nmass-loss rate from their giants. Our analysis revealed a strong enhancement of\nthe wind at the orbital plane.\n", "  We complete the recent derivation of a Ruijsenaars type system that arises as\na reduction of the natural free system on the Heisenberg double of SU(n,n). The\nprevious analysis by Marshall focused on a dense open submanifold of the\nreduced phase space, and here we describe the full phase space wherein\nLiouville integrability of the system holds by construction.\n", "  This paper presents an analytical comparison of active and passive receiver\nmodels in diffusive molecular communication. In the active model, molecules are\nabsorbed when they collide with the receiver surface. In the passive model, the\nreceiver is a virtual boundary that does not affect molecule behavior. Two\napproaches are presented to derive transforms between the receiver signals. As\nan example, two models for an unbounded diffusion-only molecular communication\nsystem with a spherical receiver are unified. As time increases in the\nthree-dimensional system, the transform functions have constant scaling\nfactors, such that the receiver models are effectively equivalent. Methods are\npresented to enable the transformation of stochastic simulations, which are\nused to verify the transforms and demonstrate that transforming the simulation\nof a passive receiver can be more efficient and more accurate than the direct\nsimulation of an absorbing receiver.\n", "  We introduce a notion of universal preparability for a state of a system,\nmore precisely: for a normal state on a von Neumann algebra. It describes a\nsituation where from an arbitrary initial state it is possible to prepare a\ntarget state with arbitrary precision by a repeated interaction with a sequence\nof copies of another system. For $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})$ we give criteria\nsufficient to ensure that all normal states are universally preparable which\ncan be verified for a class of non-commutative birth and death processes\nrealized, in particular, by the interaction of a micromaser with a stream of\natoms. As a tool the theory of tight sequences of states and of stationary\nstates is further developed and we show that in the presence of stationary\nfaithful normal states universal preparability of all normal states is\nequivalent to asymptotic completeness, a notion studied earlier in connection\nwith the scattering theory of non-commutative Markov processes.\n", "  Laser noise is a decisive limiting factor in high precision spectroscopy of\nnarrow lines using atomic ensembles. In an idealized Doppler and differential\nlight shift free magic wavelength lattice configuration, it remains as one\ndistinct principal limitation beyond collective atomic decay. In this work we\nstudy the limitations originating from laser phase and amplitude noise in an\nidealized Ramsey pulse interrogation scheme with uncorrelated atoms. Phase\nnoise leads to a saturation of the frequency sensitivity with increasing atom\nnumber while amplitude noise implies a scaling $1/\\sqrt{\\tau}$ with $\\tau$\nbeing the interrogation time. We employ a technique using decoherence free\nsubspaces first introduced in New J. Phys. \\textbf{14}, 043011 (2012) which can\nrestore the scaling with the square root of the inverse particle number\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$. Similar results and improvements are obtained numerically for a\nRabi spectroscopy setup.\n", "  In this note we consider a quantum reduction scheme in deformation\nquantization on symplectic manifolds proposed by Bordemann, Herbig and Waldmann\nbased on BRST cohomology. We explicitly construct the induced map on\nequivalence classes of star products which will turn out to be an analogue to\nthe Kirwan map but in the Cartan model of equivariant cohomology. As a\nbyproduct we shall see that every star product on a (suitable) reduced manifold\nis equivalent to a reduced star product.\n", "  The maximum operational range of continuous variable quantum key distribution\nprotocols has shown to be improved by employing high-efficiency forward error\ncorrection codes. Typically, the secret key rate model for such protocols is\nmodified to account for the non-zero word error rate of such codes. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that this model is incorrect: Firstly, we show by example\nthat fixed-rate error correction codes, as currently defined, can exhibit\nefficiencies greater than unity. Secondly, we show that using this secret key\nmodel combined with greater than unity efficiency codes, implies that it is\npossible to achieve a positive secret key over an entanglement breaking channel\n- an impossible scenario. We then consider the secret key model from a\npost-selection perspective, and examine the implications for key rate if we\nconstrain the forward error correction codes to operate at low word error\nrates.\n", "  We report on a direct measurement of the pair-wise anti-symmetric exchange\ninteraction, known as the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI), in a\nNd3+-doped YVO4 crystal. To this end we introduce a broadband electron spin\nresonance technique coupled with an optical detection scheme which selectively\ndetects only one Nd3+-Nd3+ pair. Using this technique we can fully determine\nthe spin-spin coupling tensor, allowing us to experimentally determine both the\nstrength and direction of the DMI vector. We believe that this ability to fully\ndetermine the interaction Hamiltonian is of interest for studying the numerous\nmagnetic phenomena where the DMI interaction is of fundamental importance,\nincluding multiferroics. We also detect a singlet-triplet transition within the\npair, with a highly suppressed magnetic-field dependence, which suggests that\nsuch systems could form singlet-triplet qubits with long coherence times for\nquantum information applications.\n", "  A generic prediction of the Coleman-Weinberg inflation is the existence of a\nheavy particle sector whose interactions with the inflaton, the lightest state\nin this sector, generate the inflaton potential at loop level. For typical\ninteractions the heavy sector may contain stable states whose relic abundance\nis generated at the end of inflation by the gravity alone. This general\nfeature, and the absence of any particle physics signal of dark matter so far,\nmotivates us to look for new directions in the dark sector physics, including\nscenarios in which dark matter is super-heavy. In this article we study the\npossibility that the dark matter is even heavier than the inflaton, its\nexistence follows from the inflaton dynamics, and its abundance today is {\\it\nnaturally} determined by the weakness of gravitational interaction. This\nimplies that the super-heavy dark matter scenarios can be tested via the\nmeasurements of inflationary parameters and/or the CMB isocurvature\nperturbations and non-Gaussianities. We explicitly work out details of three\nColeman-Weinberg inflation scenarios, study the systematics of super-heavy dark\nmatter production in those cases, and compute which parts of the parameter\nspaces can be probed by the future CMB measurements.\n", "  We report the development of the theory and computer program for analytical\nnuclear energy gradients for (extended) multi-state complete active space\nperturbation theory (CASPT2) with full internal contraction. The vertical\nshifts are also considered in this work. This is an extension of the fully\ninternally contracted CASPT2 nuclear gradient program, recently developed for a\nstate-specific variant by us [MacLeod and Shiozaki, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 051103\n(2015)]; in this extension, the so-called {\\lambda} equation is solved to\naccount for the variation of the multi-state CASPT2 energies with respect to\nthe change in the amplitudes obtained in the preceding state-specific CASPT2\ncalculations, and the Z-vector equations are modified accordingly. The program\nis parallelized using the MPI3 remote memory access protocol that allows us to\nperform efficient one-sided communication. The optimized geometries of the\nground and excited states of a copper corrole and benzophenone are presented as\nnumerical examples. The code is publicly available under the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n", "  We discuss how to use evolutionary game theory (EGT) as a framework for\nstudying how cultural dynamics and structural properties can influence the\nevolution of norms and behaviors within a society. We provide a brief tutorial\non how EGT works, and discuss what kinds of insights it can provide. We then\ndescribe three published studies in which we have developed EGT models that\nhelp explain how structural and external conditions in a society affect the\nemergence of social norms.\n", "  We have studied disorder effects on the coefficients of Ginzburg - Landau\n(GL) expansion for attractive Hubbard model within the generalized DMFT+Sigma\napproximation for the wide region of the values of attractive potential U -\nfrom the weak-coupling limit, where superconductivity is described by BCS\nmodel, towards the strong coupling, where superconducting transition is related\nto Bose - Einstein condensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs. For the case of\nsemi-elliptic initial density of states disorder influence on the coefficients\nA and B before the square and the fourth power of the order parameter is\nuniversal for at all values of electronic correlations and is related only to\nthe widening of the initial conduction band (density of states) by disorder.\nSimilar universal behavior is valid for superconducting critical temperature\nT_c (the generalized Anderson theorem) and specific heat discontinuity at the\ntransition. This universality is absent for the coefficient C before the\ngradient term, which in accordance with the standard theory of \"dirty\"\nsuperconductors is strongly suppressed by disorder in the weak-coupling region,\nbut can slightly grow in BCS - BEC crossover region, becoming almost\nindependent of disorder in the strong coupling region. This leads to rather\nweak disorder dependence of the penetration depth and coherence length, as well\nas the slope of the upper critical magnetic field at T_c, in BCS - BEC\ncrossover and strong coupling regions.\n", "  We present an accurate method for calculating hyperfine coupling constants\n(HFCCs) based on the complete active space second-order perturbation theory\n(CASPT2) with full internal contraction. The HFCCs are computed as a\nfirst-order property using the relaxed CASPT2 spin-density matrix that takes\ninto account orbital and configurational relaxation due to dynamical electron\ncorrelation. The first-order unrelaxed spin-density matrix is calculated from\none- and two-body spin-free counterparts that are readily available in the\nCASPT2 nuclear gradient program [M. K. MacLeod and T. Shiozaki, J. Chem. Phys.\n142, 051103 (2015)], whereas the second-order part is computed directly using\nthe newly extended automatic code generator. The relaxation contribution is\nthen calculated from the so-called Z-vectors that are available in the CASPT2\nnuclear gradient program. Numerical results are presented for the CN and AlO\nradicals, for which the CASPT2 values are comparable (or, even superior in some\ncases) to the ones computed by the coupled-cluster and density matrix\nrenormalization group methods. The HFCCs for the hexaaqua complexes with VII,\nCrIII, and MnII are also presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency\nof our code.\n", "  The ultraviolet background (UVB) emitted by quasars and galaxies governs the\nionization and thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM), regulates the\nformation of high-redshift galaxies, and is thus a key quantity for modeling\ncosmic reionization. The vast majority of cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations implement the UVB via a set of spatially uniform photoionization\nand photoheating rates derived from UVB synthesis models. We show that\nsimulations using canonical UVB rates reionize and, perhaps more importantly,\nspuriously heat the IGM, much earlier z ~ 15 than they should. This problem\narises because at z > 6, where observational constraints are nonexistent, the\nUVB amplitude is far too high. We introduce a new methodology to remedy this\nissue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates\nto model any chosen reionization history. Following this approach, we run a\nsuite of hydrodynamical simulations of different reionization scenarios and\nexplore the impact of the timing of reionization and its concomitant heat\ninjection on the the thermal state of the IGM. We present a comprehensive study\nof the pressure smoothing scale of IGM gas, illustrating its dependence on the\ndetails of both hydrogen and helium reionization, and argue that it plays a\nfundamental role in interpreting Lyman-alpha forest statistics and the thermal\nevolution of the IGM. The premature IGM heating we have uncovered implies that\nprevious work has likely dramatically overestimated the impact of\nphotoionization feedback on galaxy formation, which sets the minimum halo mass\nable to form stars at high redshifts. We make our new UVB photoionization and\nphotoheating rates publicly available for use in future simulations.\n", "  In electrostatic simulations of MAST plasma at electron-gyroradius scales,\nusing the local flux-tube gyrokinetic code GS2 with adiabatic ions, we find\nthat the long-time saturated electron heat flux (the level most relevant to\nenergy transport) decreases as the electron collisionality decreases. At early\nsimulation times, the heat flux \"quasi-saturates\" without any strong dependence\non collisionality, and with the turbulence dominated by streamer-like radially\nelongated structures. However, the zonal fluctuation component continues to\ngrow slowly until much later times, eventually leading to a new saturated state\ndominated by zonal modes and with the heat flux proportional to the collision\nrate, in approximate agreement with the experimentally observed collisionality\nscaling of the energy confinement in MAST. We outline an explanation of this\neffect based on a model of ETG turbulence dominated by zonal-nonzonal\ninteractions and on an analytically derived scaling of the zonal-mode damping\nrate with the electron-ion collisionality. Improved energy confinement with\ndecreasing collisionality is favourable towards the performance of future,\nhotter devices.\n", "  The cardinal focus of the present review is to explore the role of neutrinos\noriginating from the ultra-dense core of neutron stars composed of quark gluon\nplasma in the astrophysical scenario. The collective excitations of the quarks\ninvolving the neutrinos through the different kinematical processes have been\nstudied. The cooling of the neutron stars as well as pulsar kicks due to\nasymmetric neutrino emission have been discussed in detail. Results involving\ncalculation of relevant physical quantities like neutrino mean free path and\nemissivity have been presented in the framework of non-Fermi liquid behavior as\napplicable to ultra-degenerate plasma.\n", "  The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) from stellar-mass binary\nblack holes (BBHs) provided direct evidence of the existence of these systems.\nBBH lenses would have gravitational microlensing signatures that are distinct\nfrom single-lens signals. We apply Bayesian statistics to examine the\ndistinguishability of BBH microlensing events from single-lens events under\nideal observing conditions, using the photometric capabilities of the Korean\nMicrolensing Telescope Network. Given one year of observations, a source star\nat the Galactic Centre, a GW150914-like BBH lens (total mass 65M$_\\odot$, mass\nratio 0.8) at half that distance, and an impact parameter of 0.4 Einstein\nradii, we find that binarity is detectable for BBHs with separations down to\n0.0250 Einstein radii, which is nearly 3.5 times greater than the maximum\nseparation for which such BBHs would merge within the age of the Universe.\nMicrolensing searches are thus sensitive to more widely separated BBHs than GW\nsearches, perhaps allowing the discovery of BBH populations produced in\ndifferent channels of binary formation.\n", "  Ferroelectric properties of cubic chiral magnet Cu2OSeO3 can emerge due to\nthe spin noncollinearity induced by antiferromagnetic cantings. These cantings\nare the result of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and in many ways\nsimilar to the ferromagnetic cantings in weak ferromagnets. An expression for\nthe local electric polarization is derived, including terms with gradients of\nmagnetization M(r). When averaged over the crystal the electric polarization\nhas a non-vanishing part associated with the anisotropy of the crystal point\ngroup 23. In the framework of the microscopic theory, it is shown that both\nscalar and vector products of spins, (s1 . s2) and [s1 x s2], can give\ncontributions of the same order in the electric polarization.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons are quasiparticles consisting of a linear superposition of\nphotonic and excitonic states, offering potential for nonlinear optical\ndevices. The excitonic component of the polariton provides a finite Coulomb\nscattering cross section, such that the different types of exciton found in\norganic materials (Frenkel) and inorganic materials (Wannier-Mott) produce\npolaritons with different interparticle interaction strength. A hybrid\npolariton state with distinct excitons provides a potential technological route\ntowards in-situ control of nonlinear behaviour. Here we demonstrate a device in\nwhich hybrid polaritons are displayed at ambient temperatures, the excitonic\ncomponent of which is part Frenkel and part Wannier-Mott, and in which the\ndominant exciton type can be switched with an applied voltage. The device\nconsists of an open microcavity containing both organic dye and a monolayer of\nthe transition metal dichalcogenide WS$_2$. Our findings offer a perspective\nfor electrically controlled nonlinear polariton devices at room temperature.\n", "  The theory of spin drift and diffusion in two-dimensional electron gases is\ndeveloped in terms of a random walk model incorporating Rashba, linear and\ncubic Dresselhaus, and intersubband spin-orbit couplings. The additional\nsubband degree of freedom introduces new characteristics to the persistent spin\nhelix (PSH) dynamics. As has been described before, for negligible intersubband\nscattering rates, the sum of the magnetization of independent subbands leads to\na checkerboard pattern of crossed PSHs with long spin lifetime. For strong\nintersubband scattering we model the fast subband dynamics as a new random\nvariable, yielding a dynamics set by averaged spin-orbit couplings of both\nsubbands. In this case the crossed PSH becomes isotropic, rendering circular\n(Bessel) patterns with short spin lifetime. Additionally, a finite drift\nvelocity breaks the symmetry between parallel and transverse directions,\ndistorting and dragging the patterns. We find that the maximum spin lifetime\nshifts away from the PSH regime with increasing drift velocity. We present\napproximate analytical solutions for these cases and define their domain of\nvalidity. Effects of magnetic fields and initial package broadening are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is an extension of the Pierre Auger\nCosmic-Ray Observatory. It is used to detect radio emission from extensive air\nshowers with energies beyond $10^{17}~$eV in the $30 - 80~$MHz frequency band.\nAfter three phases of deployment, AERA now consists of more than 150 autonomous\nradio stations with different spacings, covering an area of about $17~$km$^2$.\nIt is located at the same site as other Auger low-energy detector extensions\nenabling combinations with various other measurement techniques. The radio\narray allows different technical schemes to be explored as well as\ncross-calibration of our measurements with the established baseline detectors\nof the Auger Observatory. We report on the most recent technological\ndevelopments and give an overview of the experimental results obtained with\nAERA. In particular, we will present the measurement of the radiation energy,\ni.e., the amount of energy that is emitted by the air shower in the form of\nradio emission, and its dependence on the cosmic-ray energy by comparing with\nthe measurement of the the well-calibrated Auger surface detector. Furthermore,\nwe outline the relevance of this result for the absolute calibration of the\nenergy scale of cosmic-ray observatories.\n", "  The control of nonlocal entanglement in solid state systems is a crucial\ningredient of quantum technologies. We investigate a Cooper-pair splitter based\non a double quantum dot realised in a semiconducting nanowire. In the presence\nof interdot tunnelling the system provides a simple mechanism to develop\nspatial entanglement even in absence of nonlocal coupling with the\nsuperconducting lead. We discuss the possibility to control the symmetry\n(singlet or triplet) of spatially separated, entangled electron pairs taking\nadvantage of the spin-orbit coupling of the nanowire. We also demonstrate that\nthe spin-orbit coupling does not impact over the entanglement purity of the\nnonlocal state generated in the double quantum dot system.\n", "  A search for narrow resonances in dielectron and dimuon invariant mass\nspectra has been performed using data obtained from proton-proton collisions at\nsqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector. The integrated luminosity for\nthe dielectron sample is 2.7 inverse femtobarns and for the dimuon sample 2.9\ninverse femtobarns. The sensitivity of the search is increased by combining\nthese data with a previously analysed set of data obtained at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV\nand corresponding to a luminosity of 20 inverse femtobarns. No evidence for\nnon-standard-model physics is found, either in the 13 TeV data set alone, or in\nthe combined data set. Upper limits on the product of production cross section\nand branching fraction have also been calculated in a model-independent manner\nto enable interpretation in models predicting a narrow dielectron or dimuon\nresonance structure. Limits are set on the masses of hypothetical particles\nthat could appear in new-physics scenarios. For the Z'[SSM] particle, which\narises in the sequential standard model, and for the superstring inspired\nZ'[psi] particle, 95% confidence level lower mass limits for the combined data\nsets and combined channels are found to be 3.37 and 2.82 TeV, respectively. The\ncorresponding limits for Kaluza-Klein gravitons arising in the Randall-Sundrum\nmodel of extra dimensions with coupling parameters 0.01 and 0.10 are 1.46 and\n3.11 TeV, respectively. These results significantly exceed the limits based on\nthe 8 TeV LHC data.\n", "  The recent availability of digital traces generated by phone calls and online\nlogins has significantly increased the scientific understanding of human\nmobility. Until now, however, limited data resolution and coverage have\nhindered a coherent description of human displacements across different spatial\nand temporal scales. Here, we characterise mobility behaviour across several\norders of magnitude by analysing ~850 individuals' digital traces sampled every\n~16 seconds for 25 months with ~10 meters spatial resolution. We show that the\ndistributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations are\nbest described by log-normal distributions and that natural time-scales emerge\nfrom the regularity of human mobility. We point out that log-normal\ndistributions also characterise the patterns of discovery of new places,\nimplying that they are not a simple consequence of the routine of modern life.\n", "  A simulation study of the energy released by extensive air showers in the\nform of MHz radiation is performed using the CoREAS simulation code. We develop\nan efficient method to extract this radiation energy from air-shower\nsimulations. We determine the longitudinal profile of the radiation energy\nrelease and compare it to the longitudinal profile of the energy deposit by the\nelectromagnetic component of the air shower. We find that the radiation energy\ncorrected for the geometric dependence of the geomagnetic emission scales\nquadratically with the energy in the electromagnetic component of the air\nshower with a second order dependency on the atmospheric density at the\nposition of the maximum of the shower development $X_\\mathrm{max}$. In a\nmeasurement where $X_\\mathrm{max}$ is not accessible, this second order\ndependence can be approximated using the zenith angle of the incoming direction\nof the air shower with only a minor deterioration in accuracy. This method\nresults in an intrinsic uncertainty of 4% with respect to the electromagnetic\nshower energy which is well below current experimental uncertainties.\n", "  Primordial or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) is now a parameter free theory\nwhose predictions are in good overall agreement with observations. However, the\n7Li calculated abundance is significantly higher than the one deduced from\nspectroscopic observations. Most solutions to this lithium problem involve a\nsource of extra neutrons that inevitably leads to an increase of the deuterium\nabundance. This seems now to be excluded by recent deuterium observations that\nhave drastically reduced the uncertainty on D/H and also calls for improved\nprecision on thermonuclear reaction rates.\n", "  Given their capability of spreading active chemical species and collecting\nelectricity, porous media made of carbon fibers are extensively used as\ndiffusion layers in energy storage systems, such as redox flow batteries. In\nspite of this, the dispersion dynamics of species inside porous media is still\nnot well understood and often lends itself to different interpretations.\nActually, the microscopic design of efficient porous media which can\npotentially and effectively improve the performances of flow batteries, is a\nstill open challenge. The present study aims to investigate the effect of\nfibrous media micro-structure on dispersion, in particular the effect of fiber\norientation on drag and dispersion dynamics. Several Lattice-Boltzmann\nsimulations of {flows through} differently-oriented fibrous media coupled with\nLagrangian simulations of particle tracers have been performed. Results show\nthat orienting fibers preferentially along the streamwise direction minimizes\nthe drag and maximizes the dispersion, which is the most desirable condition\nfor diffusion layers in flow batteries applications.\n", "  Within models containing a very light scalar particle coupled to the 125 GeV\nHiggs boson, we present the first detailed study of Higgs decays into three of\nthese light scalars. We determine model-independent conditions which the scalar\nsector after electroweak symmetry breaking has to satisfy in order for the\nthree-body channel to become relevant. Using a specific model -- the real\nscalar singlet-extension of the Standard Model (SM) -- we then identify\nscenarios, where the rates of scalar three-body Higgs decays are comparable to\nor even exceed those of the well-studied two-body channel. All those scenarios\nare shown to be compatible with current experimental and theoretical\nconstraints. We finally argue that scalar three-body Higgs decays lead to\nexciting new collider signatures with six SM fermions in the final state.\nCalculating the corresponding event rates, we find that e.g. six-muon or\nsix-tau final states may be in reach of dedicated searches at the LHC or ILC\nexperiments.\n", "  This paper introduces the historical development of the symmetries for\ndescribing magnetic structures culminating in the derivation of the black and\nwhite and colored space groups. Beginning from the Langevin model of the Curie\nlaw, it aims to show the challenges that magnetic ordering presented and how\ndifferent symmetry frameworks were developed to meet them. As well as\nexplaining core ideas, later papers will show how the different schemes are\nconnected. With these goals in mind, the maths related is kept to the minimum\nrequired for clarity.\n", "  A collective chaotic phase with power law scaling of activity events is\nobserved in a disordered mean field network of purely excitatory leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons with short-term synaptic plasticity. The dynamical\nphase diagram exhibits two transitions from quasi-synchronous and asynchronous\nregimes to the nontrivial, collective, bursty regime with avalanches. In the\nhomogeneous case without disorder, the system synchronizes and the bursty\nbehavior is reflected into a doubling-period transition to chaos for a two\ndimensional discrete map. Numerical simulations show that the bursty chaotic\nphase with avalanches exhibits a spontaneous emergence of time correlations and\nenhanced Kolmogorov complexity. Our analysis reveals a mechanism for the\ngeneration of irregular avalanches that emerges from the combination of\ndisorder and deterministic underlying chaotic dynamics.\n", "  We study the current-voltage characteristics of Fe(Se,Te) thin films\ndeposited on CaF$_2$ substrates in form of nanostrips (width $w\\sim\\lambda$,\n$\\lambda$ the London penetration length). In view of a possible application of\nthese materials to superconductive electronics and micro-electronics we focus\non transport properties in small magnetic field, the one generated by the bias\ncurrent. From the characteristics taken at different temperatures we derive\nestimates for the pinning potential $U$ and the pinning potential range\n$\\delta$. Since the sample lines are very narrow, the classical creep flow\nmodel provides a sufficiently accurate interpretation of the data only when the\nattractive interaction between magnetic flux lines of opposite sign is taken\ninto account. The observed voltages and the induced detriment of the critical\ncurrent of the nanostrips are compatible with the presence of few tens of\nmagnetic field lines at the equilibrium and a strongly inhomogeneous current\ndensity distribution. In particular, we argue that the sharp corners defining\nthe bridge geometry represent points of easy magnetic flux lines injection. The\nresults are relevant for creep flow analysis in superconducting Fe(Se,Te)\nnanostrips.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries are observed to have a range of eccentricities and\nspin-orbit misalignments (stellar obliquities). Whether such properties are\nprimordial, or arise from post-formation dynamical interactions remains\nuncertain. This paper considers the scenario in which the binary is the inner\ncomponent of a hierarchical triple stellar system, and derives the requirements\nthat the tertiary companion must satisfy in order to raise the eccentricity and\nobliquity of the inner binary. Through numerical integrations of the secular\noctupole-order equations of motion of stellar triples, coupled with the spin\nprecession of the oblate primary star due to the torque from the secondary, we\nobtain a simple, robust condition for producing spin-orbit misalignment in the\ninner binary: In order to excite appreciable obliquity, the precession rate of\nthe stellar spin axis must be smaller than the orbital precession rate due to\nthe tertiary companion. This yields quantitative requirements on the mass and\norbit of the tertiary. We also present new analytic expressions for the maximum\neccentricity and range of inclinations allowing eccentricity excitation\n(Lidov-Kozai window), for stellar triples with arbitrary masses and including\nthe non-Keplerian potentials introduced by general relativity, stellar tides\nand rotational bulges. The results of this paper can be used to place\nconstraints on unobserved tertiary companions in binaries that exhibit high\neccentricity and/or spin-orbit misalignment, and will be helpful in guiding\nefforts to detect external companions around stellar binaries. As an\napplication, we consider the eclipsing binary DI Herculis, and identify the\nrequirements that a tertiary companion must satisfy to produce the observed\nspin-orbit misalignment.\n", "  We present the first results of the KMOS Lens-Amplified Spectroscopic Survey\n(KLASS), a new ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) large program, doing multi-object\nintegral field spectroscopy of galaxies gravitationally lensed behind seven\ngalaxy clusters selected from the HST Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space\n(GLASS). Using the power of the cluster magnification we are able to reveal the\nkinematic structure of 25 galaxies at $0.7 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2.3$, in four\ncluster fields, with stellar masses $8 \\lesssim \\log{(M_\\star/M_\\odot)}\n\\lesssim 11$. This sample includes 5 sources at $z>1$ with lower stellar masses\nthan in any previous kinematic IFU surveys. Our sample displays a diversity in\nkinematic structure over this mass and redshift range. The majority of our\nkinematically resolved sample is rotationally supported, but with a lower ratio\nof rotational velocity to velocity dispersion than in the local universe,\nindicating the fraction of dynamically hot disks changes with cosmic time. We\nfind no galaxies with stellar mass $<3 \\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ in our sample\ndisplay regular ordered rotation. Using the enhanced spatial resolution from\nlensing, we resolve a lower number of dispersion dominated systems compared to\nfield surveys, competitive with findings from surveys using adaptive optics. We\nfind that the KMOS IFUs recover emission line flux from HST grism-selected\nobjects more faithfully than slit spectrographs. With artificial slits we\nestimate slit spectrographs miss on average 60% of the total flux of emission\nlines, which decreases rapidly if the emission line is spatially offset from\nthe continuum.\n", "  Integrated thin-film lithium niobate platform has recently emerged as a\npromising candidate for next-generation, high-efficiency wavelength conversion\nsystems that allow dense packaging and mass-production. Here we demonstrate\nefficient, phase-matched second harmonic generation in lithographically-defined\nthin-film lithium niobate waveguides with sub-micron dimensions. Both modal\nphase matching in fixed-width waveguides and quasi-phase matching in\nperiodically grooved waveguides are theoretically proposed and experimentally\ndemonstrated. Our low-loss (~ 3.0 dB/cm) nanowaveguides possess normalized\nconversion efficiencies as high as 41% W-1cm-2.\n", "  This paper reports a search for triboson $W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}W^{\\mp}$ production\nin two decay channels ($W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}W^{\\mp}\\rightarrow\n\\ell^{\\pm}\\nu\\ell^{\\pm}\\nu\\ell^{\\mp}\\nu$ and $W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}W^{\\mp}\\rightarrow\n\\ell^{\\pm}\\nu\\ell^{\\pm}\\nu{}jj$ with $\\ell=e, \\mu$) in proton-proton collision\ndata corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Events with exactly three charged leptons, or two leptons with the\nsame electric charge in association with two jets, are selected. The total\nnumber of events observed in data is consistent with the Standard Model (SM)\npredictions. The observed 95 % confidence level upper limit on the SM\n$W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}W^{\\mp}$ production cross section is found to be 730 fb with an\nexpected limit of 560 fb in the absence of SM $W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}W^{\\mp}$\nproduction. Limits are also set on $WWWW$ anomalous quartic gauge couplings.\n", "  The characterization of quantum information quantifiers has attracted a\nconsiderable attention of the scientific community, since they are a useful\ntool to verify the presence of quantum correlations in a quantum system. In\nthis context, in the present work we show a theoretical study of some\nquantifiers, such as entanglement witness, entanglement of formation, Bell's\ninequality violation and geometric quantum discord as a function of the\ndiffractive properties of neutron scattering. We provide one path toward\nidentifying the presence of quantum correlations and quantum nonlocality in a\nmolecular magnet as a Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ dimer, by diffractive properties\ntypically obtained via neutron scattering experiments.\n", "  The quantitative analysis of electron-optical phase images recorded using\noff-axis electron holography often relies on the use of computer simulations of\nelectron propagation through a sample. However, simulations that make use of\nthe independent atom approximation are known to overestimate experimental phase\nshifts by approximately 10%, as they neglect bonding effects. Here, we compare\nexperimental and simulated phase images for few-layer WSe2 . We show that a\ncombination of pseudopotentials and all-electron density functional theory\ncalculations can be used to obtain accurate mean electron phases, as well as\nimproved atomic-resolution spatial distribution of the electron phase. The\ncomparison demonstrates a perfect contrast match between experimental and\nsimulated atomic-resolution phase images for a sample of precisely know\nthickness. The low computational cost of this approach makes it suitable for\nthe analysis of large electronic systems, including defects, substitutional\natoms and material interfaces.\n", "  We extend the recently proposed heat-bath configuration interaction (HCI)\nmethod [Holmes, Tubman, Umrigar, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12, 3674 (2016)], by\nintroducing a semistochastic algorithm for performing multireference\nEpstein-Nesbet perturbation theory, in order to completely eliminate the severe\nmemory bottleneck of the original method. The proposed algorithm has several\nattractive features. First, there is no sign problem that plagues several\nquantum Monte Carlo methods. Second, instead of using Metropolis-Hastings\nsampling, we use the Alias method to directly sample determinants from the\nreference wavefunction, thus avoiding correlations between consecutive samples.\nThird, in addition to removing the memory bottleneck, semistochastic HCI (SHCI)\nis faster than the deterministic variant for many systems if a stochastic error\nof 0.1 mHa is acceptable. Fourth, within the SHCI algorithm one can trade\nmemory for a modest increase in computer time. Fifth, the perturbative\ncalculation is embarrassingly parallel. The SHCI algorithm extends the range of\napplicability of the original algorithm, allowing us to calculate the\ncorrelation energy of very large active spaces. We demonstrate this by\nperforming calculations on several first row dimers including F2 with an active\nspace of (14e, 108o), Mn-Salen cluster with an active space of (28e, 22o), and\nCr2 dimer with up to a quadruple-zeta basis set with an active space of (12e,\n190o). For these systems we were able to obtain better than 1 mHa accuracy with\na wall time of merely 55 seconds, 37 seconds, and 56 minutes on 1, 1, and 4\nnodes, respectively.\n", "  We enhanced the total transmission of light through a disordered waveguide\nwith spatially inhomogeneous scattering and loss by shaping the incident\nwavefront of a laser beam. Using an on-chip tapered lead, we were able to\naccess all input modes in the waveguide with a spatial light modulator. The\nadaptive wavefront shaping resulted in selective coupling of input light to\nhigh transmission channels, which bypassed the regions of higher scattering and\nloss in the waveguide. The spatial inhomogeneity of scattering and loss led to\nredirecting of energy flux to optical paths with less scattering and loss to\nmaximize total energy transported through the system. This work demonstrated\nthe power of wavefront shaping in coherent control of light transport in\ninhomogeneous scattering media, which are common in real applications.\n", "  In this note we remark that the butterfly effect can be used to diagnose the\nphase transition of superconductivity in a holographic framework. Specifically,\nwe compute the butterfly velocity in a charged black hole background as well as\nanisotropic backgrounds with Q-lattice structure. In both cases we find its\nderivative to the temperature is discontinuous at critical points. We also\npropose that the butterfly velocity can signalize the occurrence of thermal\nphase transition in general holographic models.\n", "  We look for long-living topological solutions of classical nonlinear $(1+1)-$\ndimensional $\\varphi^4$ field theory. To that effect we use the well-known\ncut-and-match method. In this framework, new long-living states are obtained in\nboth topological sectors. In particular, in one case a highly excited state of\na kink is found. We discover several ways of energy reset. In addition to the\nexpected emission wave packets (with small amplitude), for some selected\ninitial conditions the production of kink-antikink pairs results in a large\nenergy reset. Also, the topological number of a kink in the central region\nchanges in the contrast of saving full topological number. At lower excitation\nenergies there is a long-living excited vibrational state of the kink; this\nphenomenon is the final stage of all considered initial states. Over time this\nexcited state of the kink changes to a well-known linearized solution - a\ndiscrete kink excitation mode. This method yields a qualitatively new way to\ndescribe the large-amplitude bion, which was detected earlier in the\nkink-scattering processes in the nontopological sector.\n", "  We investigate glueball inflation model-building via the methods of the\ngauge/gravity duality. For that purpose, we consider a certain 5d consistent\ntruncation of type IIB supergravity. This theory admits a solution, whose\nmetric is of the form of a $dS_4$ fibration over a fifth dimension. We find a\nnew time-dependent deformation around this solution, which allows for a small\n$\\eta$ parameter of the corresponding inflationary model. This resolves a\nproblem with a previous solution that allowed only $\\eta$ of order one and thus\ngave only an ultra-slow roll regime, but not regular slow roll.\n", "  We illustrate how finite-temperature charge and thermal Drude weights of\none-dimensional systems can be obtained from the relaxation of initial states\nfeaturing global (left-right) gradients in the chemical potential or\ntemperature. The approach is tested for spinless interacting fermions as well\nas for the Fermi-Hubbard model, and the behaviour in the vicinity of singular\npoints (such as half filling or isotropic chains) is discussed. We present\ntechnical details on how to implement the calculation in practice using the\ndensity matrix renormalization group and show that the non-equilibrium dynamics\nis often less demanding to simulate numerically and features simpler\nfinite-time transients than the corresponding linear response current\ncorrelators; thus, new parameter regimes can become accessible. As an\napplication, we determine the thermal Drude weight of the Hubbard model for\ntemperatures T which are an order of magnitude smaller than those reached in\nthe equilibrium approach. This allows us to demonstrate that at low T and half\nfilling, thermal transport is successively governed by spin excitations and\ndescribed quantitatively by the Bethe ansatz Drude weight of the Heisenberg\nchain.\n", "  CMB and lensing reconstruction power spectra are powerful probes of\ncosmology. However they are correlated, since the CMB power spectra are lensed\nand the lensing reconstruction is constructed using CMB multipoles. We perform\na full analysis of the auto- and cross-covariances, including polarization\npower spectra and minimum variance lensing estimators, and compare with\nsimulations of idealized future CMB-S4 observations. Covariances sourced by\nfluctuations in the unlensed CMB and instrumental noise can largely be removed\nby using a realization-dependent subtraction of lensing reconstruction noise,\nleaving a relatively simple covariance model that is dominated by\nlensing-induced terms and well described by a small number of principal\ncomponents. The correlations between the CMB and lensing power spectra will be\ndetectable at the level of $\\sim 5\\sigma$ for a CMB-S4 mission, and neglecting\nthose could underestimate some parameter error bars by several tens of percent.\nHowever we found that the inclusion of external priors or data sets to estimate\nparameter error bars can make the impact of the correlations almost negligible.\n", "  We apply reservoir engineering to construct a thermal environment with\ncontrollable temperature in an ultracold atomic Rydberg system. A Boltzmann\ndistribution of the system's eigenstates is produced by optically driving a\nsmall environment of ultracold atoms, which is coupled to a photonic continuum\nthrough spontaneous emission. This technique provides a useful tool for quantum\nsimulation of dynamics coupled to a thermal environment. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that pure eigenstates, such as Bell states, can be prepared in the\nRydberg atomic system using this method.\n", "  Here we demonstrate the controlled growth of Bi(110) and Bi(111) films on an\n(insulating) $\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) substrate by surface X-ray diffraction\nand X-ray reflectivity using synchrotron radiation. At temperatures as low as\n40 K, unanticipated pseudo-cubic Bi(110) films are grown having a thickness\nranging from a few to tens of nanometers. The roughness at the film-vacuum as\nwell as at the film-substrate interface, can be reduced by mild heating, where\na crystallographic orientation transition of Bi(110) towards Bi(111) is\nobserved at 400 K. From 450 K onwards high quality and ultrasmooth Bi(111)\nfilms are formed. Growth around the transition temperature results in the\ngrowth of competing Bi(110) and Bi(111) thin film domains.\n", "  In this paper, we develop a direct method for the characterization of dark\nmodes. The results can be used to construct a transformation that separates\ndark and bright modes, through the decomposition of system dynamics. We also\nstudy a synthesis problem by engineering the system-environment coupling and\nHamiltonian engineering. We apply the theory to investigate an optomechanical\ndark mode.\n", "  A new scheme for lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) dark matter is\nintroduced and studied in theories of TeV supersymmetry with a QCD axion, $a$,\nand a high reheat temperature after inflation, $T_R$. A large overproduction of\naxinos ($\\tilde{a}$) and gravitinos ($\\tilde{G}$) from scattering at $T_R$, and\nfrom freeze-in at the TeV scale, is diluted by the late decay of a saxion\ncondensate that arises from inflation. The two lightest superpartners are\n$\\tilde{a}$, with mass of order the TeV scale, and $\\tilde{G}$ with mass\n$m_{3/2}$ anywhere between the keV and TeV scales, depending on the mediation\nscale of supersymmetry breaking. Dark matter contains both warm and cold\ncomponents: for $\\tilde{G}$ LSP the warm component arises from $\\tilde{a}\n\\rightarrow \\tilde{G}a$, while for $\\tilde{a}$ LSP the warm component arises\nfrom $\\tilde{G} \\rightarrow \\tilde{a}a$. The free-streaming scale for the warm\ncomponent is predicted to be of order 1 Mpc (and independent of $m_{3/2}$ in\nthe case of $\\tilde{G}$ LSP). $T_R$ can be as high as $10^{16}$ GeV, for any\nvalue of $m_{3/2}$, solving the gravitino problem. The PQ symmetry breaking\nscale $V_{PQ}$ depends on $T_R$ and $m_{3/2}$ and can be anywhere in the range\n$(10^{10} - 10^{16})$ GeV. Detailed predictions are made for the lifetime of\nthe neutralino LOSP decaying to $\\tilde{a}+ h/Z$ and $\\tilde{G}+h/Z/\\gamma$,\nwhich is in the range of $(10^{-1}-10^6)$m over much of parameter space. For an\naxion misalignment angle of order unity, the axion contribution to dark matter\nis sub-dominant, except when $V_{PQ}$ approaches $10^{16}$ GeV.\n", "  The rainbow chain is an inhomogenous exactly solvable local spin model that,\nin its ground state, displays a half-chain entanglement entropy growing\nlinearly with the system size. Although many exact results about the rainbow\nchain are known, the structure of the underlying quantum field theory has not\nyet been unraveled. Here we show that the universal scaling features of this\nmodel are captured by a massless Dirac fermion in a curved space-time with\nconstant negative curvature $R=-h^2$ ($h$ is the amplitude of the\ninhomogeneity). This identification allows us to use recently developed\ntechniques to study inhomogeneous conformal systems and to analytically\ncharacterise the entanglement entropies of more general bipartitions. These\nresults are carefully tested against exact numerical calculations. Finally, we\nstudy the entanglement entropies of the rainbow chain in thermal states, and\nfind that there is a non-trivial interplay between the rainbow effective\ntemperature $T_R$ and the physical temperature $T$.\n", "  Recent studies of the analytical and numerical models of neutron stars\nsuggest that their exterior field can be described by only four arbitrary\nparameters of the 2-soliton solution of Einstein's equations. Assuming that\nthis is the case, we show that there exists an infinite hierarchy of the\nuniversal relations for neutron stars in terms of multipole moments that arises\nas a series of the degeneration conditions for generic soliton solutions. Our\nanalysis of the simplest of these relations shows that the no-hair conjecture\nfor neutron stars proposed by Yagi {\\it et al.} fails to be verified by the\nperfect fluid models, but we argue that the conjecture could still be true for\nthe models involving anisotropic fluid.\n", "  In the present work we theoretically study the length dependence of\nthermopower of a single-molecule junction with a chain-like molecular bridge of\nan arbitrary length using a tight-binding model. We analyze conditions bringing\na nonlinear growth of the thermopower accompanying the extension of the bridge\nlength. Also, we show that the thermopower may decrease with increasing\nmolecular length provided that the molecular bridge is sufficiently long.\n", "  This proceeding gives a summary of the current status and open questions of\nthe radio technique for cosmic-ray air showers, assuming that the reader is\nalready familiar with the principles. It includes recent results of selected\nexperiments not present at this conference, e.g., LOPES and TREND. Current\nradio arrays like AERA or Tunka-Rex have demonstrated that areas of several\nkm^2 can be instrumented for reasonable costs with antenna spacings of the\norder of 200 m. For the energy of the primary particle such sparse antenna\narrays can already compete in absolute accuracy with other precise techniques,\nlike the detection of air-fluorescence or air-Cherenkov light. With further\nimprovements in the antenna calibration, the radio detection might become even\nmore accurate. For the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, currently\nonly the dense array LOFAR features a precision similar to the fluorescence\ntechnique, but analysis methods for the radio measurement of Xmax are still\nunder development. Moreover, the combination of radio and muon measurements is\nexpected to increase the accuracy of the mass composition, and this\naround-the-clock recording is not limited to clear nights as are the\nlight-detection methods. Consequently, radio antennas will be a valuable add-on\nfor any air shower array targeting the energy range above 100 PeV.\n", "  Tunka-Rex, the Tunka Radio extension at the TAIGA facility (Tunka Advanced\nInstrument for cosmic ray physics and Gamma Astronomy) in Siberia, has recently\nbeen expanded to a total number 63 SALLA antennas, most of them distributed on\nan area of one square kilometer. In the first years of operation, Tunka-Rex was\nsolely triggered by the co-located air-Cherenkov array Tunka-133. The\ncorrelation of the measurements by both detectors has provided direct\nexperimental proof that radio arrays can measure the position of the shower\nmaximum. The precision achieved so far is 40 g/cm^2, and several methodical\nimprovements are under study. Moreover, the cross-comparison of Tunka-Rex and\nTunka-133 shows that the energy reconstruction of Tunka-Rex is precise to 15 %,\nwith a total accuracy of 20 % including the absolute energy scale. By using\nexactly the same calibration source for Tunka-Rex and LOPES, the energy scale\nof their host experiments, Tunka-133 and KASCADE-Grande, respectively, can be\ncompared even more accurately with a remaining uncertainty of about 10 %. The\nmain goal of Tunka-Rex for the next years is a study of the cosmic-ray mass\ncomposition in the energy range above 100 PeV: For this purpose, Tunka-Rex now\nis triggered also during daytime by the particle detector array Tunka-Grande\nfeaturing surface and underground scintillators for electron and muon\ndetection.\n", "  This paper introduces AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via\nReaction-Diffusion) version 1.0. AcCoRD is a sandbox reaction-diffusion solver\ndesigned for the study of molecular communication systems. It uses a hybrid of\nmicroscopic and mesoscopic simulation models that enables scalability via user\ncontrol of local accuracy. AcCoRD is developed in C as an open source command\nline tool and includes utilities to process simulation output in MATLAB. The\nlatest code and links to user documentation can be found at\nhttps://github.com/adamjgnoel/AcCoRD/. This paper provides an overview of\nAcCoRD's design, including the motivation for developing a specialized\nreaction-diffusion solver. The corresponding algorithms are presented in\ndetail, including the computational complexity of the microscopic and\nmesoscopic models. Other novel derivations include the transition rates between\nadjacent mesoscopic subvolumes of different sizes. Simulation results\ndemonstrate the use of AcCoRD as both an accurate reaction-diffusion solver and\none that is catered to the analysis of molecular communication systems. A link\nis included to videos that demonstrate many of the simulated scenarios.\nAdditional insights from the simulation results include the selection of\nsuitable hybrid model parameters, the impact of reactive surfaces that are in\nthe proximity of a hybrid interface, and the size of a bounded environment that\nis necessary to assume that it is unbounded. The development of AcCoRD is\nongoing, so its future direction is also discussed in order to highlight\nimprovements that will expand its potential areas of application. New features\nthat are being planned at the time of writing include a fluid flow model and\nmore complex actor behavior.\n", "  It was previously noted that SU(5) unification can be achieved via the simple\naddition of light scalar leptoquarks from two split $\\bf10$ multiplets. We\nexplore the parameter space of this model in detail and find that unification\nrequires at least one leptoquark to have mass below $\\approx16\\,$TeV. We point\nout that introducing splitting of the $\\bf24$ allows the unification scale to\nbe raised beyond $10^{16}$ GeV, while a U(1)$_{PQ}$ symmetry can be imposed to\nforbid dangerous proton decay mediated by the light leptoquarks. The latest\nbounds from LHC searches are combined and we find that a leptoquark as light as\n400 GeV is still permitted. Finally, we discuss the interesting possibility\nthat the leptoquarks required for unification could also be responsible for the\n$2.6\\sigma$ deviation observed in the ratio $R_K$ at LHCb.\n", "  We compute numerically the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several\noperators in the 3d Ising CFT, and then try to reverse-engineer the solution to\ncrossing symmetry analytically. Our key tool is a set of new techniques for\ncomputing infinite sums of SL(2,R) conformal blocks. Using these techniques, we\nsolve the lightcone bootstrap to all orders in an asymptotic expansion in large\nspin, and suggest a strategy for going beyond the large spin limit. We carry\nout the first steps of this strategy for the 3d Ising CFT, deriving analytic\napproximations for the dimensions and OPE coefficients of several infinite\nfamilies of operators in terms of the initial data\n$\\{\\Delta_\\sigma,\\Delta_\\epsilon,f_{\\sigma\\sigma\\epsilon},f_{\\epsilon\\epsilon\\epsilon},c_T\\}$.\nThe analytic results agree with numerics to high precision for about 100\nlow-twist operators (correctly accounting for O(1) mixing effects between\nlarge-spin families). Plugging these results back into the crossing equations,\nwe obtain approximate analytic constraints on the initial data.\n", "  We point out to another indication of the black-disk limit exceeding in\nhadron interactions found in the recent impact parameter analysis performed by\nthe TOTEM Collaboration at $\\sqrt{s}$=8 TeV and emphasise that this observation\nmight be interpreted as a confirmation of the reflective scattering mode\nappearance at the LHC energies.\n", "  HE0450-2958, an interacting quasar-starburst galaxy pair at $z$ = 0.285, is\none of the best known examples of strong star formation activity in the\npresence of a quasar-driven jet. We present new multi-band JVLA-imaging\ncovering 1 to 6 GHz and reaching an angular resolution of up to\n$0{}_{{}^.}^{\"}6$ (a 6-fold improvement over existing radio data). We confirm\nthe previous detection of a spatially extended radio component around the\nquasar indicating that there is on-going star formation activity in the quasar\nhost galaxy. For the first time, we directly detect a jet-like bipolar outflow\nfrom the quasar aligned with its companion star-forming galaxy (SFG) and\nseveral blobs of ionized gas in its vicinity identified in previous studies.\nWithin the companion SFG we find evidence for a flattening of the synchrotron\nspectral index towards the point of intersection with the jet axis, further\nsuggesting that the outflow may actually be impacting its interstellar medium\n(ISM). We discuss two possible mechanisms that could have triggered the\nstarburst in the companion SFG: a wet-dry merger with the quasar and\njet-induced star formation. While triggering through interaction-driven gas\ndynamics cannot be excluded with current data, our new observations make\nHE0450-2958 a strong candidate for jet-induced star formation, and one of the\nrare links between local systems (like Minkowski's Object or Centaurus A) and\nthe high-z regime where radio-optical alignments suggest that this phenomenon\ncould be more common.\n", "  In this review, we present an overview of four proof-of-concept of\nsingle-atom transistors based on four technologies : Atom doping, Single\nelectron transistors, Single-atom metallic wire and Multilevel atomic-scale\nswitching. Techniques and methods to build these transistors are described as\nsuch as the theory behind their mechanisms.\n", "  Accurate rates for energy-degenerate l-changing collisions are needed to\ndetermine cosmological abundances and recombination. There are now several\ncompeting theories for the treatment of this process, and it is not possible to\ntest these experimentally. We show that the H I two-photon continuum produced\nby astrophysical nebulae is strongly affected by l-changing collisions. We\nperform an analysis of the different underlying atomic processes and simulate\nthe recombination and two-photon spectrum of a nebula containing H and He. We\nprovide an extended set of effective recombination coefficients and updated\nl-changing 2s-2p transition rates using several competing theories. In\nprinciple, accurate astronomical observations could determine which theory is\ncorrect.\n", "  The numerical analysis of the diffraction features rendered by transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) typically relies either on classical approximations\n(Monte Carlo simulations) or quantum paraxial tomography (the multislice method\nand any of its variants). Although numerically advan- tageous (relatively\nsimple implementations and low computational costs), they involve important\napproximations and thus their range of applicability is limited. To overcome\nsuch limitations, an alternative, more general approach is proposed, based on\nan optimal combination of wave-packet propagation with the on-the-fly\ncomputation of associated Bohmian trajectories. For the sake of clarity, but\nwithout loss of generality, the approach is used to analyze the diffraction of\nan electron beam by a thin aluminum slab as a function of three different\nincidence (work) conditions which are of interest in electron microscopy: the\nprobe width, the tilting angle, and the beam energy. Specifically, it is shown\nthat, because there is a dependence on particular thresholds of the beam\nenergy, this approach provides a clear description of the diffraction process\nat any energy, revealing at the same time any diversion of the beam inside the\nmaterial towards directions that cannot be accounted for by other conventional\nmethods, which is of much interest when dealing with relatively low energies\nand/or relatively large tilting angles.\n", "  The objective of this work enclosed with the study of spatially homogeneous\nanisotropic Bianchi type-I universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ is the Ricci\nscalar and $T$ is the trace of stress energy momentum tensor) in two different\ncases viz. $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ and $f(R,T)=f_1(R)+f_2(T)$ with bulk viscosity\nmatter content. In this study, we consider a time varying deceleration\nparameter, which generates an accelerating universe to obtain the exact\nsolution of the field equations. The physical and kinematical properties of\nboth the models are discussed in detail for the future evolution of the\nuniverse. We have explored the nature of WEC, DEC, SEC and energy density for\nboth the cases. We have found that both the models, with bulk viscosity matter\ncomponent, show an acceleration of the universe. We have also shown that the\ncosmic jerk parameter is compatible with the three kinematical data sets.\n", "  High-temperature superconductivity occurs near antiferromagnetic\ninstabilities and nematic state. Debate remains on the origin of nematic order\nin FeSe and its relation with superconductivity. Here, we use transport,\nneutron scatter- ing and Fermi surface measurements to demonstrate that\nhydro-thermo grown superconducting FeS, an isostructure of FeSe, is a\ntetragonal paramagnet without nematic order and with a quasiparticle mass\nsignificantly reduced from that of FeSe. Only stripe-type spin excitation is\nobserved up to 100 meV. No direct coupling between spin excitation and\nsuperconductivity in FeS is found, suggesting that FeS is less correlated and\nthe nematic order in FeSe is due to competing checkerboard and stripe spin\nfluctuations.\n", "  When a liquid film of colloidal solution consisting of particles of different\nsizes is dried on a substrate, the colloids often stratify, where smaller\ncolloids are laid upon larger colloids. This phenomenon is counter intuitive\nbecause larger colloids which have smaller diffusion constant are expected to\nremain near the surface during the drying process, leaving the layer of larger\ncolloids on top of smaller colloids. Here we show that the phenomenon is caused\nby the interaction between the colloids, and can be explained by the diffusion\nmodel which accounts for the interaction between the colloids. By studying the\nevolution equation both numerically and analytically, we derive the condition\nat which the stratified structures are obtained.\n", "  Very special relativity (VSR) keeps the main features of special relativity\nbut breaks rotational invariance due to an intrinsic preferred direction. We\nstudy the VSR modified extended BRST and anti-BRST symmetry of the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky (BV) actions corresponding to the $p=1,2,3$-form gauge\ntheories. Within VSR framework, we discuss the extended BRST invariant and\nextended BRST and anti-BRST invariant superspace formulations for these BV\nactions. Here we observe that the VSR modified extended BRST invariant BV\nactions corresponding to the $p=1,2,3$-form gauge theories can be written\nmanifestly covariant manner in a superspace with one Grassmann coordinate.\nMoreover, two Grassmann coordinates are required to describe the VSR modified\nextended BRST and extended anti-BRST invariant BV actions in a superspace.\nThese results are consistent with the Lorentz invariant (special relativity)\nformulation.\n", "  A quantum dot formed in a suspended carbon nanotube exposed to an external\nmagnetic field is predicted to act as a thermoelectric unipolar spin battery\nwhich generates pure spin current. The built-in spin flip mechanism is a\nconsequence of the spin-vibration interaction resulting from the interplay\nbetween the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the vibrational modes of the\nsuspended carbon nanotube. On the other hand, utilizing thermoelectric effect,\nthe temperature difference between the electron and the thermal bath to which\nthe vibrational modes are coupled provides the driving force. We find that both\nmagnitude and direction of the generated pure spin current are dependent on the\nstrength of spin-vibration interaction, the sublevel configuration in dot, the\ntemperatures of electron and thermal bath, and the tunneling rate between the\ndot and the pole. Moreover, in the linear response regime, the kinetic\ncoefficient is non-monotonic in the temperature $T$ and it reaches its maximum\nwhen $k_BT$ is about one phonon energy. The existence of a strong intradot\nCoulomb interaction is irrelevant for our spin battery, provided that\nhigh-order cotunneling processes are suppressed.\n", "  We introduce two novel time-dependent figures of merit for both online and\noffline optimizations of advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detector network\noperations with respect to (i) detecting continuous signals from known source\nlocations and (ii) detecting GWs of neutron star binary coalescences from known\nlocal galaxies, which thereby have the highest potential for electromagnetic\ncounterpart detection. For each of these scientific goals, we characterize an\n$N$-detector network, and all its $(N-1)$-detector subnetworks, to identify\nsubnetworks and individual detectors (key contributors) that contribute the\nmost to achieving the scientific goal. Our results show that aLIGO-Hanford is\nexpected to be the key contributor in 2017 to the goal of detecting GWs from\nthe Crab pulsar within the network of LIGO and Virgo detectors. For the same\ntime period and for the same network, both LIGO detectors are key contributors\nto the goal of detecting GWs from the Vela pulsar, as well as to detecting\nsignals from 10 high interest pulsars. Key contributors to detecting continuous\nGWs from the Galactic Center can only be identified for finite time intervals\nwithin each sidereal day with either the 3-detector network of the LIGO and\nVirgo detectors in 2017, or the 4-detector network of the LIGO, Virgo, and\nKAGRA detectors in 2019-2020. Characterization of the LIGO-Virgo detectors with\nrespect to goal (ii) identified the two LIGO detectors as key contributors.\nAdditionally, for all analyses, we identify time periods within a day when lock\nlosses or scheduled service operations could result with the least amount of\nsignal-to-noise or transient detection probability loss for a detector network.\n", "  We consider Quantum OBDD model. It is restricted version of read-once Quantum\nBranching Programs, with respect to \"width\" complexity. It is known that\nmaximal complexity gap between deterministic and quantum model is exponential.\nBut there are few examples of such functions. We present method (called\n\"reordering\"), which allows to build Boolean function $g$ from Boolean Function\n$f$, such that if for $f$ we have gap between quantum and deterministic OBDD\ncomplexity for natural order of variables, then we have almost the same gap for\nfunction $g$, but for any order. Using it we construct the total function $REQ$\nwhich deterministic OBDD complexity is $2^{\\Omega(n/\\log n)}$ and present\nquantum OBDD of width $O(n^2)$. It is bigger gap for explicit function that was\nknown before for OBDD of width more than linear. Using this result we prove the\nwidth hierarchy for complexity classes of Boolean functions for quantum OBDDs.\n  Additionally, we prove the width hierarchy for complexity classes of Boolean\nfunctions for bounded error probabilistic OBDDs. And using \"reordering\" method\nwe extend a hierarchy for $k$-OBDD of polynomial size, for $k=o(n/\\log^3n)$.\nMoreover, we proved a similar hierarchy for bounded error probabilistic\n$k$-OBDD. And for deterministic and probabilistic $k$-OBDDs of superpolynomial\nand subexponential size.\n", "  Integrable optics is an innovation in particle accelerator design that\nprovides strong nonlinear focusing while avoiding parametric resonances. One\npromising application of integrable optics is to overcome the traditional\nlimits on accelerator intensity imposed by betatron tune-spread and collective\ninstabilities. The efficacy of high-intensity integrable accelerators will be\nundergo comprehensive testing over the next several years at the Fermilab\nIntegrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland\nElectron Ring (UMER). We propose an integrable Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (iRCS)\nas a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for\nthe Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide a overview of the machine\nparameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization. Integrable optics\nrequires arcs with integer-pi phase advance followed by drifts with matched\nbeta functions. We provide an example integrable lattice with features of a\nmodern RCS - long dispersion-free drifts, low momentum compaction,\nsuperperiodicity, chromaticity correction, separate-function magnets, and\nbounded beta functions.\n", "  The flow inside remnants of binary neutron star (NS) mergers is expected to\nbe turbulent, because of magnetohydrodynamics instability activated at scales\ntoo small to be resolved in simulations. To study the large-scale impact of\nthese instabilities, we develop a new formalism, based on the large-eddy\nsimulation technique, for the modeling of subgrid-scale turbulent transport in\ngeneral relativity. We apply it, for the first time, to the simulation of the\nlate-inspiral and merger of two NSs. We find that turbulence can significantly\naffect the structure and survival time of the merger remnant, as well as its\ngravitational-wave (GW) and neutrino emissions. The former will be relevant for\nGW observation of merging neutron stars. The latter will affect the composition\nof the outflow driven by the merger and might influence its nucleosynthetic\nyields. The accretion rate after black-hole formation is also affected.\nNevertheless, we find that, for the most likely values of the turbulence mixing\nefficiency, these effects are relatively small and the GW signal will be\naffected only weakly by the turbulence. Thus, our simulations provide a first\nvalidation of all existing post-merger GW models.\n", "  In the fluid transport of particles, it is generally expected that heavy\nparticles carried by a laminar fluid flow moving downward will also move\ndownward. We establish a theory to show, however, that particles can be\ndynamically levitated and lifted by interacting vortices in such flows, thereby\nmoving against gravity and the asymptotic direction of the flow, even when they\nare orders of magnitude denser than the fluid. The particle levitation is\nrigorously demonstrated for potential flows and supported by simulations for\nviscous flows. We suggest that this counterintuitive effect has potential\nimplications for the air-transport of water droplets and the lifting of\nsediments in water.\n", "  The transport of heat out of tokamak plasmas by turbulence is the dominant\nmechanism limiting the performance of fusion reactors. Turbulence can be driven\nby the ion temperature gradient (ITG) and suppressed by toroidal sheared flows.\nNumerical simulations attempting to understand turbulence are crucial for\nguiding the design of future reactors. We investigate ion-scale turbulence via\ngyrokinetic simulations in the outer core of the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak\n(MAST). We perform a parameter scan in the values of the ITG and the flow\nshear. We show that nonlinear simulations reproduce the experimental ion heat\nflux and that the experimental values of the ITG and the flow shear lie close\nto the turbulence threshold. We demonstrate that the system is subcritical in\nthe presence of flow shear, i.e., the system is formally stable, but\ntransitions to a turbulent state given a large enough initial perturbation. We\npropose a scenario for the transition to turbulence previously unreported in\ntokamak plasmas: close to the threshold, the plasma is dominated by a low\nnumber of coherent long-lived structures; as the system is taken away from the\nthreshold into the more unstable regime, the number of these structures\nincreases until they fill the domain and a more conventional turbulence\nemerges. We make comparisons of correlation properties between our simulations\nand experimental measurements of density fluctuations from the MAST BES\ndiagnostic. We apply a synthetic diagnostic to our simulation data and find\nreasonable agreement of the correlation properties of the simulated and\nexperimental turbulence, most notably of the correlation time. We show that the\nproperties of turbulence are essentially functions of the ion heat flux. We\nfind that turbulence close to the threshold is strongly affected by flow shear,\nwhereas far from threshold, the turbulence resembles a conventional ITG-driven\nregime.\n", "  We report in this paper a new exponential relation distance of planets in the\nnewly discovered exoplanetary system of the Trappist-1 star, and we comment on\nnear orbital mean motion resonances among the seven planets. We predict that\npossible smaller planets could be found inside the orbit of the innermost\ndiscovered Planet b.\n", "  In the paper we first construct rational solutions for the\nNijhoff-Quispel-Capel (NQC) equation by means of bilinear method. These\nsolutions can be transferred to those of Q3$_\\delta$ equation in the\nAdler-Bobenko-Suris (ABS) list. Then making use of degeneration relation we\nobtain rational solutions for Q2, Q1$_\\delta$, H3$_\\delta$, H2 and H1. These\nrational solutions are in Casoratian form and the basic column vector satisfies\nan extended condition equation set.\n", "  Weakly-coupled TeV-scale particles may mediate the interactions between\nnormal matter and dark matter. If so, the LHC would produce dark matter through\nthese mediators, leading to the familiar \"mono-X\" search signatures, but the\nmediators would also produce signals without missing momentum via the same\nvertices involved in their production. This document from the LHC Dark Matter\nWorking Group suggests how to compare searches for these two types of signals\nin case of vector and axial-vector mediators, based on a workshop that took\nplace on September 19/20, 2016 and subsequent discussions. These suggestions\ninclude how to extend the spin-1 mediated simplified models already in\nwidespread use to include lepton couplings. This document also provides\nanalytic calculations of the relic density in the simplified models and reports\nan issue that arose when ATLAS and CMS first began to use preliminary numerical\ncalculations of the dark matter relic density in these models.\n", "  Following the successful observation of single conversion electrons from\n$^{83m}$Kr using Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), Project 8 is\nnow advancing its focus toward a tritium beta decay spectrum. A tritium\nspectrum will be an important next step toward a direct measurement of the\nneutrino mass for Project 8. Here we discuss recent progress on the development\nand commissioning of a new gas cell for use with tritium, and outline the\nprimary goals of the experiment for the near future.\n", "  We discuss top-quark physics at the ILC with a focus on the full off-shell\nprocesses for $t\\bar{t}$ and $t\\bar{t}H$ production, including top-quark decays\nand also leptonic $W$ decays. A special focus is on the matching of the\nresummed vNRQCD threshold calculation and the fixed-order NLO QCD continuum\ncalculation, where we present an update on the validation of the matching. All\nof the calculations have been performed in the \\wz event generator framework.\n", "  Coronal supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are observed as dark trails descending\ntowards hot turbulent fan shaped regions. Due to the large temperature values,\nand gradients in these fan regions the thermal conduction should be very\nefficient. While several models have been proposed to explain the triggering\nand the evolution of SADs, none of these scenarios address a systematic\nconsideration of thermal conduction. Thus, we accomplish this task numerically\nsimulating the evolution of SADs within this framework. That is, SADs are\nconceived as voided (subdense) cavities formed by non-linear waves triggered by\ndownflowing bursty localized reconnection events in a perturbed hot fan. We\ngenerate a properly turbulent fan, obtained by a stirring force that permits\ncontrol of the energy and vorticity input in the medium where SADs develop. We\ninclude anisotropic thermal conduction and consider plasma properties\nconsistent with observations. Our aim is to study if it is possible to prevent\nSADs to vanish by thermal diffusion. We find that this will be the case,\ndepending on the turbulence parameters. In particular, if the magnetic field\nlines are able to envelope the voided cavities, thermally isolating them from\nthe hot environment. Velocity shear perturbations that are able to generate\ninstabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type help to produce magnetic islands,\nextending the life-time of SADs.\n", "  Motivated by the exploration of bipolaronic superconductivity in conducting\npolymers, we examine such a possibility in the starting member of\n$p$-oligophenyls $-$ $p$-terphenyl with three phenyl rings, belonging to the\nfamily of conducting polymer polyparaphenylene. The formation of bipolarons is\nidentified from Raman scattering measurements. Both the dc and ac magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements reveal that $p$-terphenyl is a type-II\nsuperconductor with a critical temperature of 7.2 K upon doping potassium. The\nelectron-lattice interaction, manifested by pronounced bipolaronic bands, is\nsuggested to account for the observed superconductivity. Conducting polymers\nare thus demonstrated to have the potential for the development of new\nsuperconducting technologies and devices.\n", "  Organic compounds are promising candidates to exhibit high temperature or\nroom temperature superconductivity. However, the critical temperatures of\norganic superconductors are bounded to 38 K. By doping potassium into\n$p$-terphenyl consisting of C and H elements with three phenyl rings connected\nby single C-C bond in para position, we find that this material can have a\nsuperconducting phase with the critical temperature of 43 K. The\nsuperconducting parameters such as the critical fields, coherent length, and\npenetration depth are obtained for this superconductor. These findings open an\nencouraging window for the search of high temperature superconductors in chain\nlink organic molecules.\n", "  We present a muon capture front-end scheme for muon based applications. In\nthis Front-End design, a proton bunch strikes a target and creates secondary\npions that drift into a capture channel, decaying into muons. A series of rf\ncavities forms the resulting muon beams into a series of bunches of differerent\nenergies, aligns the bunches to equal central energies, and initiates\nionization cooling. We also discuss the design of a chicane system for the\nremoval of unwanted secondary particles from the muon capture region and thus\nreduce activation of the machine. With the aid of numerical simulations we\nevaluate the performance of this Front-End scheme as well as study its\nsensitivity against key parameters such as the type of target, the number of rf\ncavities and the gas pressure of the channel.\n", "  When a flash of light from a star overtakes a straight linear filament of gas\nor dust and is seen later by an observer, a pattern of perceived illumination\noccurs that encodes information about the distance to the flash, the distance\nto illumination fronts on the filament, and the orientation of the filament. To\nhelp decode this information, geometric considerations of light echoes from\nsuch filaments are considered. A distinction is made between real spots, which\noccur unambiguously on a filament, and perceived spot echoes, which are seen by\nobservers and may appear differently to separated observers. For context, a\nseries of critical points are defined on a hypothetically infinite filament.\nReal spot pair creation events will only occur on an infinite filament at the\nclosest distance to the flash, while perceived spot pair events will only occur\nwhen the radial speed component toward the observer of a real spot crosses the\nspeed of light. If seen, a perceived spot pair creation event could provide\nunique information toward decoding distance and orientation information of the\nflash and the filament. On filament segments, typically only one of these\nperceived spots will be seen. Geometries where a perceived spot appears to move\nwith an angular component toward the flash are shown possible. Echo and source\ndistance determinations for filaments that pass between the observer and flash\nare considered. Hypothetical examples are given for Merope variably\nilluminating IC 349, and Rigel creating perceived spots on IC 2118.\n", "  We use the multi-epoch K$\\rm _S$ band observations, covering a $\\sim$5 years\nbaseline to obtain milli and sub-milli arcsec precision astrometry for a sample\nof eighteen previously known high proper motion sources, including precise\nparallaxes for these sources for the first time. In this study we show the\ncapability of the VVV project to measure high precision trigonometric\nparallaxes for very low mass stars (VLMS) up to distances of $\\sim$250\\,pc\nreaching farther than most other ground based surveys or space missions for\nthese types of stars. Additionally, we used spectral energy distribution to\nsearch for evidence of unresolved binary systems and cool sub-dwarfs. We\ndetected five systems that are most likely VLMS belonging to the Galactic halo\nbased on their tangential velocities, and four objects within 60 pc that are\nlikely members of the thick disk. A more comprehensive study of high proper\nmotion sources and parallaxes of VLMS and brown dwarfs with the VVV is ongoing\n, including thousands of newly discovered objects.\n", "  Recently the spectacular result was derived quantum mechanically that the\ntotal angular momentum of photons in light beams with finite lateral extensions\ncan have half-integer quantum numbers. In a circularly polarized Gauss light\nbeam it is half of the spin angular momentum which it would have in a\nrespective infinitely extended wave. In another paper it was shown by a\nclassical calculation that the magnetic moment induced by such a beam in a\nmetal is a factor of two smaller than the one induced by a respective\ninfinitely extended wave. Since the system's angular momentum is proportional\nto its magnetic moment it could be assumed that the classical result for the\nmagnetic moment reflects the transfer of the total angular momenta of the beam\nphotons to the metal. Here we show that there is no hint that this is indeed\nthe case.\n", "  We use an energy loss model sensitive to thermal fluctuations to compute the\nazimuthal and momentum correlations of $b\\bar{b}$ pairs traversing a strongly\ncoupled plasma from Pb+Pb collisions at LHC ($\\sqrt{s}=2.76\\text{TeV}$). The\nazimuthal correlations are compared with those from perturbative QCD based\nsimulations. When restricted to leading order production processes, we find\nthat the strongly coupled correlations of high transverse momentum pairs\n($>4\\text{GeV}$) are broadened less efficiently than the corresponding weak\ncoupling based correlations, while low transverse momentum pairs (1-4GeV) are\nbroadened with similar efficiency, but with an order of magnitude more\nparticles ending up in this momentum class.\n  The strong coupling momentum correlations we compute account for initial\ncorrelations and reveal that the particle pairs suppressed from initially high\nmomenta to the low momentum domain do not suffice to explain the stark\ndifference to the weak coupling results in momentum correlations for 1-4GeV.\n  From this, we conclude that $b\\bar{b}$ pairs are more likely to stay\ncorrelated in momentum when propagating through a strongly coupled plasma than\na weakly coupled one.\n", "  We start with the Lax representation for the Kaup-Kupersschmidt equation\n(KKE). We We outline the deep relation between the scalar Lax operator and the\nmatrix Lax operators related to Kac-Moody algebras. Then we derive the MKdV\nequations gauge equivalent to the KKE. Next we outline the symmetry and the\nspectral properties of the relevant Lax operator. Using the dressing\nZakharov-Shabat method we demonstrate that the MKdV and KKE have two types of\none-soliton solutions and briefly comment on their properties.\n", "  We analyze several types of soliton solutions to a family of Tzitzeica\nequations. To this end we use two methods for deriving the soliton solutions:\nthe dressing method and Hirota method. The dressing method allows us to derive\ntwo types of soliton solutions. The first type corresponds to a set of 6\nsymmetrically situated discrete eigenvalues of the Lax operator $L$; to each\nsoliton of the second type one relates a set of 12 discrete eigenvalues of $L$.\nWe also outline how one can construct general $N$ soliton solution containing\n$N_1$ solitons of first type and $N_2$ solitons of second type, $N=N_1+N_2$.\nThe possible singularities of the solitons and the effects of change of\nvariables that relate the different members of Tzitzeica family equations are\nbriefly discussed. All equations allow quasi-regular as well as singular\nsoliton solutions.\n", "  Using the Friedmann equations for a closed universe with spin and torsion,\nparametric equations for the scale factor and time are derived for the early\nuniverse.\n", "  We offer interferometry models for thermal ensembles with one-body losses and\nthe phenomenological inclusion of perturbations covering most of the thermal\natom experiments. A possible extension to the many-body case is briefly\ndiscussed. The Ramsey pulses are assumed to have variable durations and the\ndetuning during the pulses is distinguished from the detuning during evolution.\nConsequently, the pulses are not restricted to resonant operation and give more\nflexibility to optimize the interferometer to particular experimental\nconditions. On this basis another model is devised in which the contrast loss\ndue to the unequal one-body population decays is cancelled by the application\nof a non-standard splitting pulse. For the importance of its practical\nimplications, an analogous spin-echo model is also provided. The developed\nmodels are suitable for the analysis of atomic clocks and a broad range of\nsensing applications, they are particularly useful for trapped-atom\ninterferometers.\n", "  Instruments to visualize transient structural changes of inhomogeneous\nmaterials on the nanometer scale with atomic spatial and temporal resolution\nare demanded to advance materials science, bioscience, and fusion sciences. One\nsuch technique is femtosecond electron microdiffraction, in which a short pulse\nof electrons with femtosecond-scale duration is focused into a micron-scale\nspot and used to obtain diffraction images to resolve ultrafast structural\ndynamics over localized crystalline domain. In this letter, we report the\nexperimental demonstration of time-resolved mega-electron-volt electron\nmicrodiffraction which achieves a 5 {\\mu}m root-mean-square (rms) beam size on\nthe sample and a 100 fs rms temporal resolution. Using pulses of 10k electrons\nat 4.2 MeV energy with a normalized emittance 3 nm-rad, we obtained high\nquality diffraction from a single 10 {\\mu}m paraffin (C_44 H_90) crystal. The\nphonon softening mode in optical-pumped polycrystalline Bi was also\ntime-resolved, demonstrating the temporal resolution limits of our instrument\ndesign. This new characterization capability will open many research\nopportunities in material and biological sciences.\n", "  Self-organized striated structures of the plasma emission have recently been\nobserved in capacitive radio-frequency CF4 plasmas by Phase Resolved Optical\nEmission Spectroscopy (PROES) and their formation was analyzed and understood\nby Particle in Cell / Monte Carlo Collision (PIC/MCC) simulations [Y.-X. Liu,\net al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 255002 (2016)]. The striations were found to\nresult from the periodic generation of double layers due to the modulation of\nthe densities of positive and negative ions responding to the externally\napplied RF potential. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the formation of\nstriations is given, as well as the effect of the driving frequency on the\nplasma parameters, such as the spatially modulated charged species densities,\nthe electric field, and the electron power absorption is studied by PROES\nmeasurements, PIC/MCC simulations, and an ion-ion plasma model. The measured\nspatio-temporal electronic excitation patterns at different driving frequencies\nshow a high degree of consistency with the simulation results. The striation\ngap (i.e., the distance between two ion density maxima) is found to be\ninversely proportional to the driving frequency. In the presence of striations\nthe minimum(CF_3^+, F^-) ion densities in the bulk region exhibit an\napproximately quadratic increase with the driving frequency. For these\ndensities, the eigenfrequency of the ion-ion plasma is near the driving\nfrequency, indicating that a resonance occurs between the positive and negative\nions and the oscillating electric field inside the plasma bulk. The maximum ion\ndensities in the plasma bulk are found not to exhibit a simple dependence on\nthe driving frequency, since these ion densities are abnormally enhanced within\na certain frequency range due to the ions being focused into the \"striations\"\nby the spatially modulated electric field inside the bulk region.\n", "  This study aims to search for the existence of intraday variability (IDV) of\nBL Lac object S5 0716+714 at high radio frequencies for which the interstellar\nscintillation effect is not significant. Using the 21-meter radio telescope of\nthe Korean VLBI Network (KVN), we present results of multi-epoch simultaneous\ndual-frequency radio observations. Single-dish observations of S5 0716+714 were\nsimultaneously conducted at 21.7 GHz (K-band) and 42.4 GHz (Q-band), with a\nhigh cadence of 30-60 minute intervals.We observed four epochs between December\n2009 and June 2010. Over the whole set of observation epochs, S5 0716+714\nshowed significant inter-month variations in flux density at both the K- and\nQ-bands, with modulation indices of approximately 19% for the K-band and\napproximately 36% for the Q-band. In all epochs, no clear intraday variability\nwas detected at either frequency. The source shows monotonic flux density\nincrease in epochs 1 and 3 and monotonic flux density decrease in epochs 2 and\n4. In the flux density increasing phases, the flux densities at the Q-band\nincrease more rapidly. In the decreasing phase, no significant flux density\ndifference is seen at the two frequencies. The situation could be different\nclose to flux density peaks that we did not witness in our observations. We\nfind an inverted spectrum with mean spectral indices of -0.57+-0.13 in epoch 1\nand -0.15+-0.11 in epoch 3. On the other hand, we find relatively steep indices\nof +0.24+-0.14 and +0.17+-0.18 in epochs 2 and 4, respectively. We conclude\nthat the frequency dependence of the variability and the change of the spectral\nindex are caused by source-intrinsic effects rather than by any extrinsic\nscintillation effect.\n", "  In this paper, we present a dual-horizon peridynamics formulation which\nallows for simulations with dual-horizon with minimal spurious wave reflection.\nWe prove the general dual property for dual-horizon peridynamics, based on\nwhich the balance of momentum and angular momentum in PD are naturally\nsatisfied. We also analyze the crack pattern of random point distribution and\nthe multiple materials issue in peridynamics. For selected benchmark problems,\nwe show that DH-PD is less sensitive to the spatial than the original PD\nformulation.\n", "  A reformulation of the Schwarzschild solution of the linearised Einstein\nfield equations in post-Riemannian Finsler spacetime is derived. The solution\nis constructed in three stages: the exterior solution, the event-horizon\nsolution and the interior solution. It is shown that the exterior solution is\nasymptotically similar to Newtonian gravity at large distances implying that\nNewtonian gravity is a low energy approximation of the solution. Application of\nEddington-Finklestein coordinates is shown to reproduce the results obtained\nfrom standard general relativity at the event horizon. Further application of\nKruskal-Szekeres coordinates reveals that the interior solution contains\nmaximally extensible geodesics.\n", "  The search engine is tightly coupled with social networks and is primarily\ndesigned for users to acquire interested information. Specifically, the search\nengine assists the information dissemination for social networks, i.e.,\nenabling users to access interested contents with keywords-searching and\npromoting the process of contents-transferring from the source users directly\nto potential interested users. Accompanying such processes, the social network\nevolves as new links emerge between users with common interests. However, there\nis no clear understanding of such a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem, namely, new\nlinks encourage more social interactions, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim\nto quantitatively characterize the social network evolution phenomenon driven\nby a search engine. First, we propose a search network model for social network\nevolution. Second, we adopt two performance metrics, namely, degree\ndistribution and network diameter. Theoretically, we prove that the degree\ndistribution follows an intensified power-law, and the network diameter\nshrinks. Third, we quantitatively show that the search engine accelerates the\nrumor propagation in social networks. Finally, based on four real-world data\nsets (i.e., CDBLP, Facebook, Weibo Tweets, P2P), we verify our theoretical\nfindings. Furthermore, we find that the search engine dramatically increases\nthe speed of rumor propagation.\n", "  We propose a scheme to simulate topological physics within a single\ndegenerate cavity, whose modes are mapped to lattice sites. A crucial\ningredient of the scheme is to construct a sharp boundary so that the open\nboundary condition can be implemented for this effective lattice system. In\ndoing so, the topological properties of the system can manifest themselves on\nthe edge states, which can be probed from the spectrum of an output cavity\nfield. We demonstrate this with two examples: a static Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\nchain and a periodically driven Floquet topological insulator. Our work opens\nup new avenues to explore exotic photonic topological phases inside a single\noptical cavity.\n", "  Droplet evaporation in turbulent sprays involves unsteady, multiscale and\nmultiphase processes which make its comprehension and model capabilities still\nlimited. The present work aims to investigate droplet vaporization dynamics\nwithin a turbulent spatial developing jet in dilute, non-reacting conditions.\nWe address the problem using a Direct Numerical Simulation of jet laden with\nacetone droplets using an hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian approach based on the\npoint droplet approximation. A detailed statistical analysis of both phases is\npresented. In particular, we show how crucial is the preferential sampling of\nthe vapour phase induced by the inhomogeneous localization of the droplets\nthrough the flow. The preferential segregation of droplets develops suddenly\ndownstream the inlet both within the turbulent core and in the mixing layer.\nTwo distinct mechanisms have been found to drive these phenomena, the inertial\nsmall-scale clustering in the jet core and the intermittent dynamics of\ndroplets across the turbulent/non-turbulent interface in the mixing layer where\ndry air entrainment occurs. These phenomenologies strongly affect the overall\nvaporization process and lead to a spectacular widening of droplets size and\nvaporization rate distributions in the downstream evolution of the turbulent\nspray.\n", "  Interstellar ubiquitous infrared spectrum (IR) due to polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) was observed in many astronomical dust clouds. A capable\nastronomical chemical evolution path from graphene to PAH was studied based on\nthe first principles calculation. Step 1 is a nucleation of nano-carbon after\nsupernova by super-cooling at expanding helium sphere. As a typical model,\ngraphene molecule (C )24 having coronene skeleton with seven carbon hexagons\nwas tried.Step 2 is a proton sputtering and passivation on ejected graphene\nmolecule. Slow speed proton with energy less than 4.3eV makes hydrogenation,\nGraphene molecule (C )24 was transformed to PAH (C24H12). Higher speed proton\nhaving sufficient energy larger than 18.3 eV could make a void in a molecule as\nlike C23H12. Resulted structure was a combination of two carbon pentagons and\nfive hexagons. Step 3 is photo-ionization of those molecules by high energy\nphoton. Electrons are removed to make a molecule to cation. Model molecule\n(C23H12) became mono-cation (C23H12)+, di-cation (C23H12)2+ and so on. Typical\nenergy difference between such cation was 6.5 and 10.8 eV. If the light source\nhas a nature of black-body radiation, effective temperature will be 18000K ~\n24000K, which suggested that central light source star may have 4 to 7 times\nheavier than our sun. Finally, theoretical IR spectrum was obtained. Especially\nin case of (C23H12)2+, calculated emission spectrum revealed that among 13\nmajor peaks, 11 peaks could correlate with ubiquitous observed IR one.\n", "  We present a simple toy model for a scalar-isoscalar two-point correlator,\nwhich can serve as a testing ground for the extraction of resonance parameters\nfrom Lattice QCD calculations. We discuss in detail how the model correlator\nbehaves when it is restricted to a finite spatial volume, and how the\nfinite-volume data can be used to reconstruct the spectral function of the\ncorrelator in the infinite volume, which allows to extract properties of the\nresonance from such data.\n", "  The stochastic model that describes radiative heat transfer in dielectric\nmedium is built. The model is based on the representation that heat transfer is\nrealized both by heat conductivity mechanism in it and due to the\nelectromagnetic radiation that is generated by thermal fluctuations of atoms in\nthe medium. Using the fluctuation-dissipative theorem, on the basis of such\nphysical suppositions, the stochastic model is formulated in the form of the\ninfinite dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process that describes medium\nfluctuations. In the model frameworks, the energy flux density of fluctuating\nelectromagnetic field is calculated in the form of the functional of\ntemperature distribution in three-dimensional medium sample.\n", "  We show how one can implement a quantum heat machine by using two interacting\ntrapped ions, in presence of a thermal bath. The electronic states of the ions\nact like a working substance, while the vibrational mode is modelled as the\ncold bath. The heat exchange with the cold bath is mimicked by the projective\nmeasurement of the electronic states. We show how such measurement in a\nsuitable basis can lead to either a quantum heat engine or a refrigerator, that\nundergoes a quantum Otto cycle. The local magnetic field is adiabatically\nchanged during the heat cycle. The performance of the heat machine depends upon\nthe interaction strength between the ions, the magnetic fields, and the\nmeasurement cost. In our model, the coupling to the hot and the cold baths are\nnever switched off in an alternative fashion during the heat cycle, unlike\nother existing proposals of quantum heat engines. This makes our proposal\nexperimentally realizable using current tapped-ion technology.\n", "  Previous attempts to study the correlation between the transit depth and the\nstellar metallicity of Kepler gas giant planets has led to different results. A\nweakly significant negative correlation was reported from the Kepler's (Q1-Q12)\ngas giant candidates with estimated radii of 5-20R$_\\odot$ and [Fe/H] values\ntaken from the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). With the release of the last Kepler\ncatalog (Q1-Q17), we now have the largest homogeneous sample of exoplanets.\nThis enables a solid statistical analysis of this correlation. In the present\nwork, we revise this correlation, within a Bayesian framework, for two large\nhomogeneous samples: confirmed and complete. We expand a Hierarchical model to\naccount for false positives in the studied samples. Our statistical analysis\nreveals no correlation between the transit depth and the stellar metallicity.\nThe fact that we found no evidence of such correlation will have implications\nfor planet formation theory and interior structure of giant planets.\n", "  A calculation of the non-singlet part of spin dependent structure function,\n$xg_1^{NS}(x,Q^2)$ and associated sum rule, the Bjorken Sum rule up to\nnext-next-to-leading order(NNLO) is presented. We use a unified approach\nincorporating Regge theory and the theoretical framework of perturbative\nQuantum Chromodynamics. Using a Regge behaved model with $Q^2$ dependent\nintercept as the initial input, we have solved the\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equation up to\nNNLO at small-$x$ for $xg_1^{NS}(x,Q^2)$ and the solutions are utilised to\ncalculate the polarised Bjorken sum rule(BSR). We have also extracted the\nhigher twist contribution to BSR based on a simple parametrisation. These\nresults for both of $xg_1^{NS}(x,Q^2)$ and BSR, along with higher twist\ncorrections are observed to be consistent with the available data taken from\nSMC, E143, HERMES, COMPASS and JLab experiments. In addition, our results are\nalso compared with that of other theoretical and phenomenological analysis\nbased on different models and a very good agreement is also observed in this\nregard. Further a very good consistency between our calculated results and\ntheoretical QCD predictions of BSR is also achieved.\n", "  The isomorphism $SU(4) \\simeq O(6)$ is used to construct the form factors of\nthe O(6) Gross-Neveu model as bound state form factors of the SU(4) chiral\nGross-Neveu model. This technique is generalized and is then applied to use the\nO(6) as the starting point of the nesting procedure to obtain the O(N) form\nfactors for general even N.\n", "  Population control policies are proposed and in some places employed as a\nmeans towards curbing population growth. This paper is concerned with a\ndisturbing side-effect of such policies, namely, the potential risk of societal\nfragmentation due to changes in the distribution of family sizes. This effect\nis illustrated in some simple settings and demonstrated by simulation. In\naddition, the dependence of societal fragmentation on family size distribution\nis analyzed. In particular, it is shown that under the studied model, any\npopulation control policy that disallows families of 3 or more children incurs\nthe possible risk of societal fragmentation.\n", "  Phase noise or frequency noise is a key metrics to evaluate the short term\nstability of a laser. This property is of a great interest for the applications\nbut delicate to characterize, especially for narrow line-width lasers. In this\nletter, we demonstrate a digital cross correlation scheme to characterize the\nabsolute phase noise of sub-hertz line-width lasers. Three 1,542 nm\nultra-stable lasers are used in this approach. For each measurement two lasers\nact as references to characterize a third one. Phase noise power spectral\ndensity from 0.5 Hz to 0.8 MHz Fourier frequencies can be derived for each\nlaser by a mere change in the configuration of the lasers. This is the first\ntime showing the phase noise of sub-hertz line-width lasers with no reference\nlimitation. We also present an analysis of the laser phase noise performance.\n", "  We report microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations of melting and superheating\nof a generic, Lennard-Jones system starting from the crystalline phase. The\nisochoric curve, the melting temperature $T_m$ and the critical superheating\ntemperature $T_{LS}$ obtained are in close agreement (well within the\nmicrocanonical temperature fluctuations) with standard molecular dynamics\none-phase and two-phase methods. These results validate the use of\nmicrocanonical Monte Carlo to compute melting points, a method which has the\nadvantage of only requiring the configurational degrees of freedom. Our\nfindings show that the strict preservation of the Hamiltonian dynamics does not\nconstitute a necessary condition to produce a realistic estimate of $T_{LS}$\nand the melting point, which brings new insight on the nature of the melting\ntransition. These results widen the use and applicability of the recently\ndeveloped Z method for the determination of the melting points of materials.\n", "  We explore how the polarization around controversial topics evolves on\nTwitter - over a long period of time (2011 to 2016), and also as a response to\nmajor external events that lead to increased related activity. We find that\nincreased activity is typically associated with increased polarization;\nhowever, we find no consistent long-term trend in polarization over time among\nthe topics we study.\n", "  Pandres has developed a theory which extends the geometrical structure of a\nreal four-dimensional space-time via a field of orthonormal tetrads with an\nenlarged covariance group. This new group, called the conservation group,\ncontains the group of diffeomorphisms as a proper subgroup and we hypothesize\nthat it is the foundational group for quantum geometry. Using the curvature\nvector, $C_\\mu$, we find a free-field Lagrangian density $C^\\mu C_\\mu\n\\sqrt{-g}\\,$. When massive objects are present a source term is added to this\nLagrangian density. Spherically symmetric solutions for both the free field and\nthe field with sources have been derived. The field equations require nonzero\nstress-energy tensors in regions where no source is present and thus may bring\nin dark matter and dark energy in a natural way. A simple model for a galaxy is\ngiven which satisfies our field equations. This model includes flat rotation\ncurves. In this paper we compare our results with recently reported results of\nMcGaugh, Lelli and Schombert which exhibit a new law between the observed\nradial acceleration and the baryonic radial acceleration. We find a slightly\ndifferent model which relates these accelerations. In conjunction with our\nmodel, the McGaugh, Lelli and Schombert relation imply a new critical baryonic\nacceleration. When applied to bulge-dominated galaxies, this critical baryonic\nacceleration may be used to predict the radial velocity curve value by using\nthe radius of the bulge.\n", "  This paper provides a mathematical approach to study metasurfaces in non flat\ngeometries. Analytical conditions between the curvature of the surface and the\nset of refracted directions are introduced to guarantee the existence of phase\ndiscontinuities. The approach contains both the near and far field cases. A\nstarting point is the formulation of a vector Snell law in presence of abrupt\ndiscontinuities on the interfaces.\n", "  Modelling physical data with linear discrete time series, namely Fractionally\nIntegrated Autoregressive Moving Average (ARFIMA), is a technique which\nachieved attention in recent years. However, these models are used mainly as a\nstatistical tool only, with weak emphasis on physical background of the model.\nThe main reason for this lack of attention is that ARFIMA model describes\ndiscrete-time measurements, whereas physical models are formulated using\ncontinuous-time parameter. In order to remove this discrepancy we show that\ntime series of this type can be regarded as sampled trajectories of the\ncoordinates governed by system of linear stochastic differential equations with\nconstant coefficients. The observed correspondence provides formulas linking\nARFIMA parameters and the coefficients of the underlying physical stochastic\nsystem, thus providing a bridge between continuous-time linear dynamical\nsystems and ARFIMA models.\n", "  The mathematical logic of a true nature of mirror symmetry expresses, in the\ncase of the Dirac Lagrangian, the ideas of the left- and right-handed photons\nreferring to long- and short-lived particles, respectively. Such a difference\nin lifetimes says about the photons of the different components having the\nunidentical masses, energies, and momenta. This requires the generalization of\nthe classical Klein-Gordon equation to the case of all types of bosons with a\nnonzero spin. The latter together with a new Dirac equation admits the\nexistence of the second type of the local gauge transformation responsible for\norigination in the Lagrangian of an interaction Newton component, which gives\nan inertial mass to all the interacting matter fields. The quantum mass\noperator and the mirror presentation of the classical Schr\\\"odinger equation\nsuggest one more highly important equation. Findings show clearly that each of\nthe quantum mass, energy, and momentum operators can individually act on the\nwave function. They constitute herewith the Euler-Lagrange equation at the\nlevel of the mass-charge structure of gauge invariance.\n", "  By investigating the optoelectronic properties of prototypical\ngraphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures, we demonstrate how a\nnanostructured combination of these materials can lead to a dramatic\nenhancement of light-matter interaction and give rise to unique excitations. In\nthe framework of ab initio many-body perturbation theory, we show that such\nheterostructures absorb light over a broad frequency range, from the\nnear-infrared to the ultraviolet (UV), and that each spectral region is\ncharacterized by a specific type of excitations. Delocalized electron-hole\npairs in graphene dominate the low-energy part of the spectrum, while strongly\nbound electron-hole pairs in h-BN are preserved in the near-UV. Besides these\nfeatures, characteristic of the pristine constituents, charge-transfer\nexcitations appear across the visible region. Remarkably, the spatial\ndistribution of the electron and the hole can be selectively tuned by\nmodulating the stacking arrangement of the individual building blocks. Our\nresults open up unprecedented perspectives in view of designing van der Waals\nheterostructures with tailored optoelectronic features.\n", "  The influence of reaction order and trap-assisted recombination on\ncontinuous-wave photoinduced absorption measurements is clarified through\nanalytical calculations and numerical simulations. The results reveal the\ncharacteristic influence of different trap distributions and enable\ndistinguishing between shallow exponential and Gaussian distributions as well\nas systems dominated by direct recombination by analyzing the temperature\ndependence of the in-phase and quadrature signals. The identifying features are\nthe intensity dependence of the in-phase at high intensity,\n$\\textit{PA}_\\text{I}\\propto I^{\\gamma_\\text{HI}}$, and the frequency\ndependence of the quadrature at low frequency, $\\textit{PA}_\\text{Q}\\propto\n\\omega^{\\gamma_\\text{LF}}$. For direct recombination $\\gamma_\\text{HI}$ and\n$\\gamma_\\text{LF}$ are temperature independent, for an exponential distribution\nthey depend on the characteristic energy $E_\\text{ch}$ as\n$\\gamma_\\text{HI}=1/(1+E_\\text{ch}/kT)$ and $\\gamma_\\text{LF}=kT/E_\\text{ch}$\nwhile a Gaussian distribution shows $\\gamma_\\text{HI}$ and $\\gamma_\\text{LF}$\nas functions of $I$ and $\\omega$, respectively.\n", "  We studied the zero-field dynamic nuclear spin polarization in a single\nIn$_{0.75}$Al$_{0.25}$As/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$As quantum dot. Even without any\nexternal magnetic field, the positive trion excited by the circularly-polarized\nlight generated an Overhauser field of up to $\\sim$0.8 T. From the excitation\npower dependences of the Overhauser field and degree of circular polarization\nof the photoluminescence spectra, the relation between the Overhauser field and\nKnight field under zero external magnetic field was revealed clearly. In\naddition, we found that the nuclear depolarization rate decreased as the\nmagnitude of the longitudinal magnetic field increased, which seemed to be\ncaused by the influence of the quadrupolar interaction of nuclear spins.\nFurther, the key parameters describing the dynamics of a coupled\nelectron-nuclear spin system, the electron g-factor and the fluctuation of the\nOverhauser field, were evaluated in a typical single InAlAs quantum dot.\n", "  A systematic modification of the entropy trajectory $S_m(T)$ is observed at\nvery low temperature in magnetically frustrated systems as a consequence of the\nconstraint $S_m\\geq 0$ imposed by the third law of thermodynamics. The lack of\nmagnetic order allows to explore some unusual thermodynamic properties by\ntracing the physical behavior of real systems. The most relevant findings are:\ni) a common $C_m/T|_{T\\to 0} \\approx 7$\\,J/molK$^2$ 'plateau' in at least five\nYb-based very-heavy-fermions VHF compounds; ii) quantitative and qualitative\ndifferences between VHF and standard non-Fermi-liquids. iii)\nEntropy-bottlenecks governing the change of $S_m(T)$ trajectories in a\ncontinuous transition into alternative ground states that exhibits third order\ncharacteristics. An empirical analysis of the possible $S_m(T\\to 0)$\ndependencies according to the $\\partial ^2 S_m/\\partial T^2$ derivative is also\npreformed. Altogether, this work can be regarded as an empirical application of\nthe third law of thermodynamics.\n", "  We consider the Laplacian and its fractional powers of order less than one on\nthe complement $\\mathbb{R}^d\\setminus\\Sigma$ of a given compact set\n$\\Sigma\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ of zero Lebesgue measure. Depending on the size of\n$\\Sigma$, the operator under consideration, equipped with the smooth compactly\nsupported functions on $\\mathbb{R}^d \\setminus \\Sigma$, may or may not be\nessentially self-ajoint. We survey well known descriptions for the critical\nsize of $\\Sigma$ in terms of capacities and Hausdorff measures. In addition, we\ncollect some known results for certain two-parameter stochastic processes. What\nwe finally want to point out is, that, although a priori essential\nself-adjointness is not a notion directly related to classical probability, it\nadmits a characterization via Kakutani type theorems for such processes.\n", "  Context: in astronomy, observing large fractions of the sky within a\nreasonable amount of time implies using large field-of-view (fov) optical\ninstruments that typically have a spatially varying Point Spread Function\n(PSF). Depending on the scientific goals, galaxies images need to be corrected\nfor the PSF whereas no direct measurement of the PSF is available. Aims: given\na set of PSFs observed at random locations, we want to estimate the PSFs at\ngalaxies locations for shapes measurements correction. Contributions: we\npropose an interpolation framework based on Sliced Optimal Transport. A\nnon-linear dimension reduction is first performed based on local pairwise\napproximated Wasserstein distances. A low dimensional representation of the\nunknown PSFs is then estimated, which in turn is used to derive representations\nof those PSFs in the Wasserstein metric. Finally, the interpolated PSFs are\ncalculated as approximated Wasserstein barycenters. Results: the proposed\nmethod was tested on simulated monochromatic PSFs of the Euclid space mission\ntelescope (to be launched in 2020). It achieves a remarkable accuracy in terms\nof pixels values and shape compared to standard methods such as Inverse\nDistance Weighting or Radial Basis Function based interpolation methods.\n", "  I present a case for proposed future linear and circular lepton colliders as\nideal machines for understanding and exploration. As machines for\nunderstanding, they provide unprecedented tools for studying the Higgs and\nobserving phenomena never before seen in nature. As machines for exploration,\nthey are ideally suited to discovering new particles interacting too weakly to\nbe seen otherwise. These arguments for future lepton colliders are largely\nindependent of the as-yet-unknown outcome of the LHC physics program.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin-whirl quasiparticles\ncurrently considered as promising components for ultra-dense memory devices. In\nthe bulk they form lattices that are stable over just a few Kelvin below the\nordering temperature. This narrow stability range presents a key challenge for\napplications, and finding ways to tune the SkL stability over a wider phase\nspace is a pressing issue. Here we show experimentally that the skyrmion phase\nin the magnetoelectric insulator ${\\text{Cu}_2 \\text{O} \\text{Se} \\text{O}_3}$\ncan either expand or shrink substantially depending on the polarity of a\nmoderate applied electric field. The data are well-described by an expanded\nmean-field model with fluctuations that show how the electric field provides a\ndirect control of the free energy difference between the skyrmion and the\nsurrounding conical phase. Our finding of the direct electric field control of\nthe skyrmion phase stability offers enormous potential for skyrmionic\napplications based on a magnetoelectric coupling.\n", "  Relations among species in ecosystems can be represented by complex networks\nwhere both negative (competition) and positive (mutualism) interactions are\nconcurrently present. Recently, it has been shown that many ecosystems can be\ncast into mutualistic networks, and that nestedness reduces effective\ninter-species competition, thus facilitating mutually beneficial interactions\nand increasing the number of coexisting species or the biodiversity. However,\ncurrent approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by\nadopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive\ninteractions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of\nmultilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and\ncompetition. Hence, we abandon the mean field hypothesis and show, through a\ndynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an\nintricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, we show\nthat when all interactions are taken into account, mutualism does not have the\nsame consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species. This\nleads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of\ncompetition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous\nconsideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our\nunderstanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in\necosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical\necology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of\nmutualistic systems.\n"]}
