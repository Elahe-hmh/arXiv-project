Experimental data\nwere compared with the tight-binding version of the Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital\n(LMTO) method and Linearized Augmented Plane-Wave (LAPW) calculations. We found\nreasonable agreement between the two calculations and experimental data. The\nmeasured FS exhibits large parallel regions with a nesting vector that agrees\nwith a previous positron annihilation study and calculations of the generalized\nsusceptibility. The measured dispersion curves also agree reasonably well with\nthe TB-LMTO calculations, albeit with some differences in the strength of the\nhybridization. In addition, the spectrum in the superconducting state revealed\na 2meV superconducting gap. The data also clearly shows the presence of a\ncoherent peak above the chemical potential, that originates from thermally\nexcited electrons above the energy of 2 delta. This feature was not previously\nobserved in the Lu-based material.\n", "  We propose a novel mechanism for creating a qubit based on a tight knot, that\nis a nano-quantum wire system so small and so cold as to be quantum coherent\nwith respect to curvature-induced effects. To establish tight knots as\nlegitimate candidates for qubits, we propose an effective curvature-induced\npotential that produces the two-level system and identify the tunnel coupling\nbetween the two local states. We propose also a different design of\nnano-mechanical qubit based on twisted nano-rods. We describe how both devices\ncan be manipulated. Also we outline possible decoherence channels, detection\nschemes and experimental setups.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the\nelectronic properties of the newly discovered iron-arsenic superconductor,\nBa(1-x)K(x)Fe2As2 and non-supercondcuting BaFe2As2. Our study indicates that\nthe Fermi surface of the undoped, parent compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$ consists of\nhole pocket(s) at Gamma (0,0) and larger electron pocket(s) at X (1,0), in\ngeneral agreement with full-potential linearized plane wave (FLAPW)\ncalculations. Upon doping with potassium, the hole pocket expands and the\nelectron pocket becomes smaller with its bottom approaching the chemical\npotential. Such an evolution of the Fermi surface is consistent with hole\ndoping within a rigid band shift model. Our results also indicate that FLAPW\ncalculation is a reasonable approach for modeling the electronic properties of\nboth undoped and K-doped iron arsenites.\n", "  We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the\nmomentum dependence of the superconducting gap in NdFeAsO1-xFx single crystals.\nWe find that the Gamma hole pocket is fully gapped below the superconducting\ntransition temperature. The value of the superconducting gap is 15 +- 1.5 meV\nand its anisotropy around the hole pocket is smaller than 20% of this value.\nThis is consistent with an isotropic or anisotropic s-wave symmetry of the\norder parameter or exotic d-wave symmetry with nodes located off the Fermi\nsurface sheets. This is a significant departure from the situation in the\ncuprates, pointing to possibility that the superconductivity in the iron\narsenic based system arises from a different mechanism.\n", "  We study the variation of the electronic properties at the surface of a high\ntemperature superconductor as a function of vacuum conditions in angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Normally, under less than ideal\nvacuum conditions the carrier concentration of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O{8+x} (Bi2212)\nincreases with time due to the absorption of oxygen from CO2 and CO molecules\nthat are prime contaminants present in ultra high vacuum (UHV) systems. We find\nthat in a high quality vacuum environment at low temperatures, the surface of\nBi2212 is quite stable (the carrier concentration remains constant), however at\nelevated temperatures the carrier concentration decreases due to the loss of\noxygen atoms from the Bi-O layer. These two effects can be used to control the\ncarrier concentration in-situ. Our finding opens the possibility of studying\nthe electronic properties of the cuprates as a function of doping across the\nphase diagram on the same piece of sample (i.e. with the same impurities and\ndefects). We envision that this method could be utilized in other surface\nsensitive techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.\n", "  The discovery of the pseudogap in the cuprates created significant excitement\namongst physicists as it was believed to be a signature of pairing, in some\ncases well above the room temperature. In this \"pre-formed pairs\" scenario, the\nformation of pairs without quantum phase rigidity occurs below T*. These pairs\ncondense and develop phase coherence only below Tc. In contrast, several recent\nexperiments reported that the pseudogap and superconducting states are\ncharacterized by two different energy scales, pointing to a scenario, where the\ntwo compete. However a number of transport, magnetic, thermodynamic and\ntunneling spectroscopy experiments consistently detect a signature of\nphase-fluctuating superconductivity above leaving open the question of whether\nthe pseudogap is caused by pair formation or not. Here we report the discovery\nof a spectroscopic signature of pair formation and demonstrate that in a region\nof the phase diagram commonly referred to as the \"pseudogap\", two distinct\nstates coexist: one that persists to an intermediate temperature Tpair and a\nsecond that extends up to T*. The first state is characterized by a doping\nindependent scaling behavior and is due to pairing above Tc, but significantly\nbelow T*. The second state is the \"proper\" pseudogap - characterized by a\n\"checker board\" pattern in STM images, the absence of pair formation, and is\nlikely linked to Mott physics of pristine CuO2 planes. Tpair has a universal\nvalue around 130-150K even for materials with very different Tc, likely setting\nlimit on highest, attainable Tc in cuprates. The observed universal scaling\nbehavior with respect to Tpair indicates a breakdown of the classical picture\nof phase fluctuations in the cuprates.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic second-order hyperpolarizabilities\n{\\gamma}(-3{\\omega}; {\\omega}, {\\omega}, {\\omega}) (indicated by {\\gamma}THG)\nof the Si2C and Si3C clusters using the highly accurate coupled cluster\nsingles-and-doubles (CCSD) response approach. The static {\\gamma} values of the\nSi2C and Si3C clusters are 1.99 \\times 10-35 and 3.16 \\times 10-35 esu,\nrespectively. Similar to the {\\alpha} values, the {\\gamma} values of the Si2C\nand Si3C clusters are smaller than those of the Si3 and Si4 clusters,\nrespectively, which is related to much smaller static {\\gamma} value of the C\natom than the Si atom.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the size-, shape-, and composition-dependent\npolarizabilities of the SimCn (m, n = 1 - 4) clusters by using the density\nfunctional based coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock method. The size-dependence of\nthe polarizabilities of the SimCn (m, n = 1 - 4) clusters is more complicated\nthan that of pure Sim and Cn (m, n = 1 - 8) clusters because for a given\ncluster size the heteroatomic clusters have more isomers than the homoatomic\nones. For the shape-dependence, we consider three kinds of shape, linear\n(chain), prolate, and compact. For most clusters, we can clearly observe orders\nof {\\alpha}(linear) > {\\alpha}(prolate) and {\\alpha}(prolate) >\n{\\alpha}(compact) for a given composition. The composition-dependence of\npolarizabilities reveals that the linear clusters have an obvious larger\npolarizability than both the prolate and the compact clusters especially for a\ngiven m/n value. The shape effect makes a main contribution to determine the\nsize of the polarizability. To understand the size of polarizability and the\nevolution of polarizability, we have tried many factors, such as the energy gap\nand binding energy, and defined a new parameter ({\\Delta}q) that characterizes\nthe redistribution of charge in cluster. We find that both the binding energy\nand the {\\Delta}q are more available than the energy gap for reflecting the\nevolution of polarizabilities provided that both the cluster shape and one of\nthe components in cluster are fixed. The correlation between the polarizability\nand the energy gap is poor, in agreement with the previous results.\n", "  The Fermi surfaces (FS's) and band dispersions of EuRh2As2 have been\ninvestigated using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The results in\nthe high-temperature paramagnetic state are in good agreement with the full\npotential linearized augmented plane wave calculations, especially in the\ncontext of the shape of the two-dimensional FS's and band dispersion around the\nGamma (0,0) and X (pi,pi) points. Interesting changes in band folding are\npredicted by the theoretical calculations below the magnetic transition\ntemperature Tn=47K. However, by comparing the FS's measured at 60K and 40K, we\ndid not observe any signature of this transition at the Fermi energy indicating\na very weak coupling of the electrons to the ordered magnetic moments or strong\nfluctuations. Furthermore, the FS does not change across the temperature (~\n25K) where changes are observed in the Hall coefficient. Notably, the Fermi\nsurface deviates drastically from the usual FS of the superconducting\niron-based AFe2As2 parent compounds, including the absence of nesting between\nthe Gamma and X FS pockets.\n", "  We have performed detailed studies of the temperature evolution of the\nelectronic structure in Ba(Fe(1-x)Ru(x))2As2 using Angle Resolved Photoemission\nSpectroscopy (ARPES). Surprisingly, we find that the binding energy of both\nhole and electron bands changes significantly with temperature in pure and Ru\nsubstituted samples. The hole and electron pockets are well nested at low\ntemperature in unsubstituted (BaFe2As2) samples, which likely drives the spin\ndensity wave (SDW) and resulting antiferromagnetic order. Upon warming, this\nnesting is degraded as the hole pocket shrinks and the electron pocket expands.\nOur results demonstrate that the temperature dependent nesting may play an\nimportant role in driving the antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic phase transition.\n", "  We investigate the vortex bound states both Schrodinger and Dirac Hamiltonian\nwith the s-wave superconducting pairing gap by solving the mean-field\nBogoliubov-de-Gennes equations. The exact vortex bound states spectrum is\nnumerically determined by the integration method, and also accompanied by the\nquasi-classical analysis. It is found that the bound state energies is\nproportional to the vortex angular momentum when the chemical potential is\nlarge enough. By applying the external magnetic field, the vortex bound state\nenergies of the Dirac Hamiltonian are almost unchanged; whereas the energy\nshift of the Schrodinger Hamiltonian is proportional to the magnetic field.\nThese qualitative differences may serve as an indirect evidence of the\nexistence of Majorana fermions in which the zero mode exists in the case of the\nDirac Hamiltonian only.\n", "  The Fermi surface in the state of cuprates is highly unusual because it\nappears to consist of disconnected segments called arcs. Their very existence\nchallenges the traditional concept of a Fermi surface as closed contours of\ngapless excitations in momentum space. The length of the arcs in the pseudogap\nstate was thought to linearly increase with temperature, pointing to the\nexistence of a nodal liquid state below T*. These results were interpreted as\nan interplay of a d-wave pairing gap and strong scattering. Understanding the\nproperties of the arcs is a pre-requisite to understanding the origin of the\npseudogap and the physics of the cuprates. Here we use a novel approach to\ndetect the energy gaps based on the temperature dependence of the density of\nstates. With a significantly improved sensitivity, we demonstrate that the arcs\nform rapidly at T* and their length remains surprisingly constant over an\nextended temperature range between T* and Tarc, consistent with the presence of\nan ordered state below T*. These arcs span fixed points in the momentum space\ndefining a set of wave vectors, which are the fingerprints of the ordered state\nthat causes the pseudogap.\n", "  In this paper, we show how the MEP hypothesis may be used to build simple\nclimate models without representing explicitly the energy transport by the\natmosphere. The purpose is twofold. First, we assess the performance of the MEP\nhypothesis by comparing a simple model with minimal input data to a complex,\nstate-of-the-art General Circulation Model. Next, we show how to improve the\nrealism of MEP climate models by including climate feedbacks, focusing on the\ncase of the water-vapour feedback. We also discuss the dependence of the\nentropy production rate and predicted surface temperature on the resolution of\nthe model.\n", "  For superconducting coils with many turns, it is widely believed that the\nmagnetic field from magnetization currents is negligible compared to the one\ngenerated by the whole coil. This article shows that this is not true for coils\nwith a considerably large number of turns (up to thousands). We introduce a\nmethod to accurately calculate the AC loss in coils with virtually any number\nof turns that takes the magnetization currents into account. The current\ndensity and AC loss is analyzed for two windings made of coated conductor\nconsisting of 32 pancake coils totaling 768 and 6400 turns, respectively.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and full-potential\nlinearized augmented-plane-wave (FP-LAPW) calculations to study the electronic\nstructure of BaCo2As2. The Fermi surface (FS) maps and the corresponding band\ndispersion data (at 90 K and 200 K) reveal a small electron pocket at the\ncenter and a large electron pocket at the corner of the Brillouin zone.\nTherefore the nesting between electron and hole FS pockets is absent in this\ncompound, in contrast to the parent compounds of FeAs-based high-T_c\nsuperconductors. The electronic structure at about 500 meV binding energy is\nvery similar to features at the chemical potential in BaFe2As2. This indicates\nthat complete substitution of Co for Fe causes a nearly rigid shift in the\nFermi energy by adding two electrons per formula unit without significant\nchanges in the band dispersions. The experimental FS topology as well as band\ndispersion data are in reasonable agreement with the FP-LAPW calculations.\n", "  Oblivious transfer protocols (R-OT and OT$_{1}^{2}$) are presented based on\nnon-orthogonal states transmission, and the bit commitment protocols on the top\nof OT$_{1}^{2}$ are constructed. Although these OT protocols are all\nunconditional secure, the bit commitment protocols based on OT protocols are\nnot secure against attack similar to that presented by no-go theorem.\n", "  Our main aim is to apply the theory of regularly varying functions to the\nasymptotical analysis at infinity of solutions of Friedmann cosmological\nequations. A new constant $\\Gamma$ is introduced related to the Friedmann\ncosmological equations. Determining the values of $\\Gamma$ we obtain the\nasymptotical behavior of the solutions, i.e. of the expansion scale factor\n$a(t)$ of a universe. The instance $\\Gamma < 1/4$ is appropriate for both\ncases, the spatially flat and open universe, and gives a sufficient and\nnecessary condition for the solutions to be regularly varying. This property of\nFriedmann equations is formulated as the generalized power law principle. From\nthe theory of regular variation it follows that the solutions under usual\nassumptions include a multiplicative term which is a slowly varying function.\n", "  A point process is R-dependent, if it behaves independently beyond the\nminimum distance R. This work investigates uniform positive lower bounds on the\navoidance functions of R-dependent simple point processes with a common\nintensity. Intensities with such bounds are described by the existence of\nShearer's point process, the unique R-dependent and R-hard-core point process\nwith a given intensity. This work also presents several extensions of the\nLov\\'asz Local Lemma, a sufficient condition on the intensity and R to\nguarantee the existence of Shearer's point process and exponential lower\nbounds. Shearer's point process shares combinatorial structure with the\nhard-sphere model with radius R, the unique R-hard-core Markov point process.\nBounds from the Lov\\'asz Local Lemma convert into lower bounds on the radius of\nconvergence of a high-temperature cluster expansion of the hard-sphere model.\nThis recovers a classic result of Ruelle on the uniqueness of the Gibbs measure\nof the hard-sphere model via an inductive approach \\`a la Dobrushin.\n", "  We have developed an angle-resolved photoemission spectrometer with tunable\nVUV laser as a photon source. The photon source is based on the fourth harmonic\ngeneration of a near IR beam from a Ti:sapphire laser pumped by a CW green\nlaser and tunable between 5.3eV and 7eV. The most important part of the set-up\nis a compact, vacuum enclosed fourth harmonic generator based on KBBF crystals,\ngrown hydrothermally in the US. This source can deliver a photon flux of over\n10^14 photons/s. We demonstrate that this energy range is sufficient to measure\nthe kz dispersion in an iron arsenic high temperature superconductor, which was\npreviously only possible at synchrotron facilities.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations to study the electronic structure of\nCaFe$_2$As$_2$ in previously unexplored collapsed tetragonal (CT) phase. This\nunusual phase of the iron arsenic high temperature superconductors was hard to\nmeasure as it exists only under pressure. By inducing internal strain, via the\npost growth, thermal treatment of the single crystals, we were able to\nstabilize the CT phase at ambient-pressure. We find significant differences in\nthe Fermi surface topology and band dispersion data from the more common\northorhombic-antiferromagnetic or tetragonal-paramagnetic phases, consistent\nwith electronic structure calculations. The top of the hole bands sinks below\nthe Fermi level, which destroys the nesting present in parent phases. The\nabsence of nesting in this phase along with apparent loss of Fe magnetic\nmoment, are now clearly experimentally correlated with the lack of\nsuperconductivity in this phase.\n", "  We use Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the\nrelationship between the pseudogap, pairing and Fermi arcs in cuprates. High\nquality data measured over a wide range of dopings reveals a consistent picture\nof Fermiology and pairing in these materials. The pseudogap is due to an\nordered state that competes with superconductivity rather then preformed pairs.\nPairing does occur below Tpair~150K and significantly above Tc, but well below\nT* and the doping dependence of this temperature scale is distinct from that of\nthe pseudogap. The d-wave gap is present below Tpair, and its interplay with\nstrong scattering creates \"artificial\" Fermi arcs for Tc<T<Tpair. However,\nabove Tpair, the pseudogap exists only at the antipodal region. This leads to\npresence of real, gapless Fermi arcs close to the node. The length of these\narcs remains constant up to T*, where the full Fermi surface is recovered. We\ndemonstrate that these findings resolve a number of seemingly contradictory\nscenarios.\n", "  We present an imaging technique that allows the recovery of the transparency\nprofile of wavelength-scale objects with deep subwavelength resolution based on\nfar-field intensity measurements. The approach, interscale mixing microscopy\n(IMM), relies on diffractive element positioned in the near-field proximity to\nthe object, to scatter information carried by evanescent waves into propagating\npart of the spectrum. A combination of numerical solutions of Maxwell equations\nand nonlinear fitting is then used to recover the information about the object\nbased on far-field intensity measurements. The potential of the developed\nformalism to recover wavelength/20 features of wavelength-scale objects in\npresence of up to 10% noise is demonstrated.\n", "  This paper illustrates the resemblance between the information-geometric\nstructures of probability spaces and that of the discrete spectrum for Hawking\nradiation. The information geometry gives rise to a reconstruction of the\nstandard formalism of quantum mechanics, while the discrete spectrum of Hawking\nradiation contributes to the semiclassical unitary evolution of Hawking\nradiation. If more realistic models of Hawking radiation are chosen, the\ninformation-geometric structures of the probability space for Hawking radiation\ncan be constructed from some physical considerations. The constructed quantum\nformalism is consistent with both the unitary evolution of Hawking radiation in\nthe semiclassical picture and the topology change of fuzzy horizons. These\naspects of Hawking radiation can be connected to some general convictions of\nquantum gravity. A comparison with the fuzzball proposal shows the limiation\nand effectiveness of this construction. We conclude that these\ninformation-geometric aspects show some possible ways bridging the gap between\nsemiclassical models and quantum gravity.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study heavy fermion\nsuperconductor Ce2RhIn8. The Fermi surface is rather complicated and consists\nof several hole and electron pock- ets. We do not observe kz dispersion of\nFermi sheets, which is consistent with 2D character of the electronic\nstructure. Comparison of the ARPES data and band structure calculations points\nto a localized picture of f electrons. Our findings pave the way for\nunderstanding the transport and thermodynamical properties of this material.\n", "  The computational complexity class #P captures the difficulty of counting the\nsatisfying assignments to a boolean formula. In this work, we use basic tools\nfrom quantum computation to give a proof that the SO(3)\nWitten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant of 3-manifolds is #P-hard to\ncalculate. We then apply this result to a question about the combinatorics of\nHeegaard splittings, motivated by analogous work on link diagrams by M.\nFreedman. We show that, if $\\#\\text{P}\\neq\\text{FP}^\\text{NP}$, then there\nexist infinitely many Heegaard splittings which cannot be made logarithmically\nthin by local WRT-preserving moves, except perhaps via a superpolynomial number\nof steps. We also outline two extensions of the above results. First, adapting\na result of Kuperberg, we show that any presentation-independent approximation\nof WRT is also #P-hard. Second, we sketch out how all of our results can be\ntranslated to the setting of triangulations and Turaev-Viro invariants.\n", "  When we use machine learning for public policy, we find that many useful\nvariables are associated with others on which it would be ethically problematic\nto base decisions. This problem becomes particularly acute in the Big Data era,\nwhen predictions are often made in the absence of strong theories for\nunderlying causal mechanisms. We describe the dangers to democratic\ndecision-making when high-performance algorithms fail to provide an explicit\naccount of causation. We then demonstrate how information theory allows us to\ndegrade predictions so that they decorrelate from protected variables with\nminimal loss of accuracy. Enforcing total decorrelation is at best a near-term\nsolution, however. The role of causal argument in ethical debate urges the\ndevelopment of new, interpretable machine-learning algorithms that reference\ncausal mechanisms.\n", "  We use a tunable laser ARPES to study the electronic properties of the\nprototypical multiband BCS superconductor MgB2. Our data reveal a strong\nrenormalization of the dispersion (kink) at ~65 meV, which is caused by\ncoupling of electrons to the E2g phonon mode. In contrast to cuprates, the 65\nmeV kink in MgB2 does not change significantly across Tc. More interestingly,\nwe observe strong coupling to a second, lower energy collective mode at binding\nenergy of 10 meV. This excitation vanishes above Tc and is likely a signature\nof the elusive Leggett mode.\n", "  We use tunable laser based Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy to study\nthe electronic structure of the multi-band superconductor, MgB2. These results\nform the base line for detailed studies of superconductivity in multi-band\nsystems. We find that the magnitude of the superconducting gap on both sigma\nbands follows a BCS-like variation with temperature with Delta0 ~7 meV. The\nvalue of the gap is isotropic within experimental uncertainty and in agreement\nwith pure a s-wave pairing symmetry. We also observe in-gap states confined to\nkF of the sigma band that occur at some locations of the sample surface. The\nenergy of this excitation, ~3 meV, is inconsistent with scattering from the pi\nband.\n", "  We use ultra-high resolution, tunable, VUV laser-based, angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and temperature and field dependent\nresistivity and thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements to study the electronic\nproperties of WTe2, a compound that manifests exceptionally large, temperature\ndependent magnetoresistance. The temperature dependence of the TEP shows a\nchange of slope at T=175 K and the Kohler rule breaks down above 70-140 K\nrange. The Fermi surface consists of two electron pockets and two pairs of hole\npockets along the X-Gamma-X direction. Upon increase of temperature from 40K,\nthe hole pockets gradually sink below the chemical potential. Like BaFe2As2,\nWTe2 has clear and substantial changes in its Fermi surface driven by modest\nchanges in temperature. In WTe2, this leads to a rare example of temperature\ninduced Lifshitz transition, associated with the complete disappearance of the\nhole pockets. These dramatic changes of the electronic structure naturally\nexplain unusual features of the transport data.\n", "  Optical frequency combs, coherent light sources that connect optical\nfrequencies with microwave oscillations, have become the enabling tool for\nprecision spectroscopy, optical clockwork and attosecond physics over the past\ndecades. Current benchmark systems are self-referenced femtosecond mode-locked\nlasers, but four-wave-mixing in high-Q resonators have emerged as alternative\nplatforms. Here we report the generation and full stabilization of\nCMOS-compatible optical frequency combs. The spiral microcomb's two\ndegrees-of-freedom, one of the comb line and the native 18 GHz comb spacing,\nare first simultaneously phase-locked to known optical and microwave\nreferences. Second, with pump power control, active comb spacing stabilization\nimproves the long-term stability by six orders-of-magnitude, reaching an\ninstrument-limited 3.6 mHz/sqrt(t) residual instability. Third, referencing\nthirty-three of the nitride frequency comb lines against a fiber comb, we\ndemonstrate the comb tooth-to-tooth frequency relative inaccuracy down to 53\nmHz and 2.8x10-16, heralding unprecedented chip-scale applications in precision\nspectroscopy, coherent communications, and astronomical spectrography.\n", "  The loss of single-particle coherence going from the superconducting state to\nthe normal state in underdoped cuprates is a dramatic effect that has yet to be\nunderstood. Here, we address this issue by performing angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in the presence of a transport\ncurrent. We find that the loss of coherence is associated with the development\nof an onset in the resistance, in that well before the midpoint of the\ntransition is reached, the sharp peaks in the ARPES spectra are completely\nsuppressed. Since the resistance onset is a signature of phase fluctuations,\nthis implies that the loss of single-particle coherence is connected with the\nloss of long-range phase coherence.\n", "  In a recent combined analysis of short baseline neutrino oscillation data by\nConrad et al it is shown that (3+3) neutrino model, defined by three active and\nthree sterile neutrinos, results in an overall goodness of $67\\%$ and a\ncompatibility of $90\\%$ among all data sets - to be compared to the\ncompatibility of $0.043\\% $ and $13\\% $ for a (3+1) and a (3+2) model,\nrespectively. Aside from the fact that (3+3) model still finds inconsistencies\nwith MiniBooNE appearance data sets, its high quality overall compatibility and\ngoodness of fit led us to study the atmospheric neutrinos in this model which\ntravel distances of thousands of kilometers through earth. We show that in this\nmixing scheme matter resonance effect inside earth enhances the small vacuum\noscillations into near-maximal transitions and at high energies these maximal\ntransitions occur in the TeV range, whereas at low energies those can occur in\nthe few GeV region. We also calculate the zenith angle distributions of\n$\\nu_{\\mu}^{CC}$(charged current) events in the 10 - 100 GeV energy range in\nDeepCore sub-array of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and comment on the\npossibility of probing active neutrino mass hierarchy and six neutrino\nscenario.\n", "  Exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have advanced to become a\nmodel system for studying dynamical Bose-Einstein condensation, macroscopic\ncoherence, many-body effects, nonclassical states of light and matter, and\npossibly quantum phase transitions in a solid state. Being low mass bosons,\nthese light-matter quasiparticles can condense at comparably high temperatures\nup to 300K, while preserving fundamental properties such as coherence in space\nand time domain even when they are out of equilibrium with the environment.\nAlthough the presence of an in-plane polariton confinement potential is not\nstrictly necessary in order to observe condensation of polaritons, engineering\nthe polariton confinement is a key to controlling, shaping and directing the\nflow of polaritons. Prototype polariton-based optoelectronic devices rely on\nultrafast photon-like velocities and strong nonlinearities, as well as on\ntailored confinement. Nanotechnology provides several pathways to achieving\nsuch a confinement, and the specific features and advantages of the different\ntechniques are discussed in this paper. As hybrid exciton-photon\nquasiparticles, polaritons can be trapped via their excitonic as well as their\nphotonic component, which leads to a wide choice of highly complementary\ntechniques. Here we highlight the almost free choice of trapping geometries and\ndepths of confinement that provides a powerful tool for control and\nmanipulation of polariton systems both in semi-classical and quantum domain.\nFurthermore, the possibility to observe effects of polariton blockade, Mott\ninsulator physics, and population of higher-order bands in sophisticated\nlattice potentials is discussed. The observation of such effects will signify\nthe opportunity for the realization of novel polaritonic non-classical light\nsources and quantum simulators.\n", "  The interplay between waves and eddies in stably stratified rotating flows is\ninvestigated by means of world-class direct numerical simulations using up to\n$3072^3$ grid points. Strikingly, we find that the shift from vortex to wave\ndominated dynamics occurs at a wavenumber $k_R$ which does not depend on\nReynolds number, suggesting that partition of energy between wave and vortical\nmodes is not sensitive to the development of turbulence at the smaller scales.\nWe also show that $k_R$ is comparable to the wavenumber at which exchanges\nbetween kinetic and potential modes stabilize at close to equipartition,\nemphasizing the role of potential energy, as conjectured in the atmosphere and\nthe oceans. Moreover, $k_R$ varies as the inverse of the Froude number as\nexplained by the scaling prediction proposed, consistent with recent\nobservations and modeling of the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere and of the\nocean.\n", "  We study magnetic domains in Nd2Fe14B single crystals using high resolution\nmagnetic force mi- croscopy (MFM). Previous MFM studies and small angle neutron\nscattering experiments suggested the presence of nano-scale domains in addition\nto optically detected micrometer-scale ones. We find, in addition to the\nelongated, wavy nano-domains reported by a previous MFM study, that the\nmicrometer size, star shape fractal pattern is constructed of an elongated\nnetwork of nano-domains ~20 nm in width, with resolution-limited domain walls\nthinner than 2 nm. While the microscopic domains exhibit significant resilience\nto an external magnetic field, some of the nano-domains are sensitive to the\nmagnetic field of the MFM tip.\n", "  We propose a time-varying optimal window width (TVOWW) selection scheme to\noptimize the performance of several nonlinear-type time-frequency analyses,\nincluding the reassignment method, and the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) and\nits variations. A window rendering the most concentrated distribution in the\ntime-frequency representation (TFR) is regarded as the optimal window. The\nTVOWW selection scheme is particularly useful for signals that comprise\nfast-varying instantaneous frequencies and small spectral gaps. To demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the method, in addition to analyzing a synthetic signal, we\nstudy an atomic time-varying dipole moment driven by two-color mid-infrared\nlaser fields in attosecond physics.\n", "  We fully implement the Aversa and Sipe sum-over-states formulism and make a\nfull ab initio band structure analysis of interband and intraband contributions\nfor the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of bulk silicon. The\nband structure and momentum matrix elements were calculated by using the highly\naccurate all-electron full potential linearized augmented plane wave method\nwithin the local density approximation. The convergence tests including the\nscissor correction with different k-points meshes and empty states were\nperformed. Both real and imaginary parts of susceptibility were directly\ncalculated and checked by the Kramers-Kronig relation. The converged results\nare compared with other theoretical and experimental ones and in agreement with\nthe recent ab initio real-time-based calculation. The nonlinear optical\ncoefficient comes from three parts: the pure interband contribution (Pinter),\nthe modulation of interband terms by intraband terms (Pmod), and the intraband\ncontribution (Jintra). For each part, the origin of enhanced peaks is explored\nby tracing the sum-over-states process. The interband contribution is found to\nbe dramatically modulated by the intraband contribution.\n", "  We use Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), Raman spectroscopy,\nLow Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and x-ray scattering to reveal an\nunusual electronically mediated charge density wave (CDW) in K0.9Mo6O17. Not\nonly does K0.9Mo6O17 lack signatures of electron-phonon coupling, but it also\nhosts an extraordinary surface CDW, with TS CDW =220 K nearly twice that of the\nbulk CDW, TB CDW =115 K. While the bulk CDW has a BCS-like gap of 12 meV, the\nsurface gap is ten times larger and well in the strong coupling regime. Strong\ncoupling behavior combined with the absence of signatures of strong\nelectron-phonon coupling indicates that the CDW is likely mediated by\nelectronic interactions enhanced by low dimensionality.\n", "  We analyze the one dimensional scattering produced by all variations of the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potential, i.e., potential well, low and high barriers. We show\nthat the P\\\"oschl-Teller well and low barrier potentials have no resonance\npoles, but an infinite number of simple poles along the imaginary axis\ncorresponding to bound and antibound states. A quite different situation arises\non the P\\\"oschl-Teller high barrier potential, which shows an infinite number\nof resonance poles and no other singularities. We have obtained the explicit\nform of their associated Gamow states. We have also constructed ladder\noperators connecting wave functions for bound and antibound states as well as\nfor resonance states. Finally, using wave functions of Gamow and antibound\nstates in the factorization method, we construct some examples of\nsupersymmetric partners of the P\\\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonian.\n", "  We investigate the effect of isotope substitution on the electron-phonon\ninteraction in the multi-band superconductor MgB2 using tunable laser based\nAngle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy. The kink structure around 70 meV in\nthe $\\sigma$ band, which is caused by electron coupling to the E2g phonon mode,\nis shifted to higher binding energy by ~3.5 meV in Mg(10)B2 and the shift is\nnot affected by superconducting transition. These results serve as the\nbenchmark for investigations of isotope effects in known, unconventional\nsuperconductors and newly discovered superconductors where the origin of\npairing is unknown.\n", "  We consider a certain infinite product of random $2 \\times 2$ matrices\nappearing in the solution of some $1$ and $1+1$ dimensional disordered models\nin statistical mechanics, which depends on a parameter $\\varepsilon>0$ and on a\nreal random variable with distribution $\\mu$. For a large class of $\\mu$, we\nprove the prediction by B. Derrida and H. J. Hilhorst (J. Phys. A 16:2641,\n1983) that the Lyapunov exponent behaves like $C \\varepsilon^{2 \\alpha}$ in the\nlimit $\\varepsilon \\searrow 0$, where $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and $C>0$ are\ndetermined by $\\mu$. Derrida and Hilhorst performed a two-scale analysis of the\nintegral equation for the invariant distribution of the Markov chain associated\nto the matrix product and obtained a probability measure that is expected to be\nclose to the invariant one for small $\\varepsilon$. We introduce suitable norms\nand exploit contractivity properties to show that such a probability measure is\nindeed close to the invariant one in a sense which implies a suitable control\nof the Lyapunov exponent.\n", "  Layered transition-metal tellurides have attracted considerable attention\nbecause of their rich physics; for example, tungsten ditelluride WTe2 exhibits\nextremely large magnetoresistance; the tritelluride ZrTe3 shows a charge\ndensity wave transition at low temperature; and the pentatelluride ZrTe5\ndisplays an enigmatic resistivity anomaly and large thermoelectric power.\nRecently some transition-metal tellurides are predicted to be quantum spin Hall\ninsulators (e.g. ZrTe5 and HfTe5) or Weyl semimetals (e.g. WTe2 and MoTe2) and\nwere subjected to intensive investigations. Here, we report on the discovery of\nsuperconductivity in hafnium pentatelluride HfTe5 under high pressure. We\nobserve two structural phase transitions and metallization with\nsuperconductivity developing at around 5 GPa. A maximal critical temperature of\n4.8 K is attained at a pressure of 20 GPa, and superconductivity persists up to\nthe maximum pressure in our study (42 GPa). Theoretical calculations indicate\nthat the superconductivity develops mainly in the Te atom layers at medium\npressure and in the Te atom chains at high pressure.\n", "  Based on the matching method, we explore the effects of adding an external\nmagnetic field on the $s$-wave holographic superconductor when the gauge field\nis in the form of the logarithmic nonlinear source. First, we obtain the\ncritical temperature as well as the condensation operator in the presence of\nlogarithmic nonlinear electrodynamics and understand that they depend on the\nnonlinear parameter $b$. We show that the critical temperature decreases with\nincreasing $b$, which implies that the nonlinear gauge field makes the\ncondensation harder. Then, we turn on the magnetic field in the bulk and find\nthe critical magnetic field, $B_c$, in terms of the temperature, which also\ndepends on the nonlinear parameter $b$. We observe that for temperature smaller\nthan the critical temperature, $T<T_c$, the critical magnetic field increases\nwith increasing $b$ and goes to zero as $T\\rightarrow T_c$, independent of the\nnonlinear parameter $b$. In the limiting case where $ b\\rightarrow0 $, all\nresults restore those of the holographic superconductor with magnetic field in\nMaxwell theory.\n", "  Taking advantage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe82 data, we have\nexplored the spatial distribution of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) within an\narea of 8$\\times$8 Mpc$^2$ centred around the galaxy cluster Abell 168 ($z$ =\n0.045). This intermediate massive cluster ($\\sigma$ = 550 km s$^{-1}$) is\nsurrounded by a complex large-scale structure. Our work confirms the presence\nof UDGs in the cluster and in the large-scale structure that surrounds it, and\nit is the first detection of UDGs outside clusters. Approximately 50 per cent\nof the UDGs analysed in the selected area inhabit the cluster region ($\\sim$11\n$\\pm$ 5 per cent in the core and $\\sim$39 $\\pm$ 9 per cent in the outskirts),\nwhereas the remaining UDGs are found outside the main cluster structure\n($\\sim$50 $\\pm$ 11 per cent). The colours and the spatial distribution of the\nUDGs within this large-scale structure are more similar to the dwarf galaxies\nthan to L$_\\star$ galaxies, suggesting that most of UDGs could be bona fide\ndwarf galaxies.\n", "  We study the decimation to a sublattice of half the sites, of the\none-dimensional Dyson-Ising ferromagnet with slowly decaying long-range pair\ninteractions of the form $\\frac{1}{{|i-j|}^{\\alpha}}$, in the phase transition\nregion (1< $\\alpha \\leq$ 2, and low temperature). We prove non-Gibbsianness of\nthe decimated measure at low enough temperatures by exhibiting a point of\nessential discontinuity for the finite-volume conditional probabilities of\ndecimated Gibbs measures. Thus result complements previous work proving\nconservation of Gibbsianness for fastly decaying potentials ($\\alpha$ > 2) and\nprovides an example of a \"standard\" non-Gibbsian result in one dimension, in\nthe vein of similar resuts in higher dimensions for short-range models. We also\ndiscuss how these measures could fit within a generalized (almost vs. weak)\nGibbsian framework. Moreover we comment on the possibility of similar results\nfor some other transformations.\n", "  In a type I Dirac or Weyl semimetal, the low energy states are squeezed to a\nsingle point in momentum space when the chemical potential Ef is tuned\nprecisely to the Dirac/Weyl point. Recently, a type II Weyl semimetal was\npredicted to exist, where the Weyl states connect hole and electron bands,\nseparated by an indirect gap. This leads to unusual energy states, where hole\nand electron pockets touch at the Weyl point. Here we present the discovery of\na type II topological Weyl semimetal (TWS) state in pure MoTe2, where two sets\nof WPs (W2+-, W3+-) exist at the touching points of electron and hole pockets\nand are located at different binding energies above Ef. Using ARPES, modeling,\nDFT and calculations of Berry curvature, we identify the Weyl points and\ndemonstrate that they are connected by different sets of Fermi arcs for each of\nthe two surface terminations. We also find new surface \"track states\" that form\nclosed loops and are unique to type II Weyl semimetals. This material provides\nan exciting, new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions.\n", "  The family of magnetic rare-earth pyrochlore oxides R2M2O7 plays host to a\ndiverse array of exotic phenomena, driven by the interplay between geometrical\nfrustration and spin-orbit interaction, which leads to anisotropy in both\nmagnetic moments and their interactions. In this article we establish a\ngeneral, symmetry--based theory of pyrochlore magnets with anisotropic exchange\ninteractions. Starting from a very general model of nearest-neighbour exchange\nbetween Kramers ions, we find four distinct classical ordered states, all with\nq=0, competing with a variety of spin-liquids and unconventional forms of\nmagnetic order. The finite-temperature phase diagram of this model is\ndetermined by Monte Carlo simulation, supported by classical spin-wave\ncalculations. We pay particular attention to the region of parameter space\nrelevant to the widely studied materials Er2Ti2O7, Yb2Ti2O7, and Er2Sn2O7. We\nfind that many of the most interesting properties of these materials can be\ntraced back to the \"accidental\" degeneracies where phases with different\nsymmetries meet. These include the ordered ground state selection by\nfluctuations in Er2Ti2O7, the dimensional-reduction observed in Yb2Ti2O7, and\nthe lack of reported magnetic order in Er2Sn2O7. We also discuss the\napplication of this theory to other pyrochlore oxides.\n", "  Lagrangian descriptions of irreducible and reducible integer higher-spin\nrepresentations of the Poincare group subject to a Young tableaux\n$Y[\\hat{s}_1,\\hat{s}_2]$ with two columns are constructed within a metric-like\nformulation in a $d$-dimensional flat space-time on the basis of a BRST\napproach extending the results of [arXiv:1412.0200[hep-th]]. A\nLorentz-invariant resolution of the BRST complex within both the constrained\nand unconstrained BRST formulations produces a gauge-invariant Lagrangian\nentirely in terms of the initial tensor field $\\Phi_{[\\mu]_{\\hat{s}_1},\n[\\mu]_{\\hat{s}_2}}$ subject to $Y[\\hat{s}_1,\\hat{s}_2]$ with an additional\ntower of gauge parameters realizing the $(\\hat{s}_1-1)$-th stage of\nreducibility with a specific dependence on the value\n$(\\hat{s}_1-\\hat{s}_2)=0,1,...,\\hat{s}_1$. Minimal BRST--BV action is\nsuggested, being proper solution to the master equation in the minimal sector\nand providing objects appropriate to construct interacting Lagrangian\nformulations with mixed-antisymmetric fields in a general framework.\n", "  We use ultrahigh resolution, tunable, vacuum ultraviolet laser angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to study the electronic properties of\nWTe$_2$, a material that was predicted to be a type-II Weyl semimetal. The Weyl\nfermion states in WTe2 were proposed to emerge at the crossing points of\nelectron and hole pockets; and Fermi arcs connecting electron and hole pockets\nwould be visible in the spectral function on (001) surface. Here we report the\nobservation of such Fermi arcs in WTe2 confirming the theoretical predictions.\nThis provides strong evidence for type-II Weyl semimetallic states in WTe2.\n", "  We investigate prime factorization from two perspectives: quantum annealing\nand computational algebraic geometry, specifically Gr\\\"obner bases. We present\na novel scalable algorithm which combines the two approaches and leads to the\nfactorization of all bi-primes up to just over $200 \\, 000$, the largest number\nfactored to date using a quantum processor.\n", "  We use our high resolution He-lamp based, tunable laser-based ARPES\nmeasurements and density functional theory calculations to study the electronic\nproperties of LaBi, a binary system that was proposed to be a member of a new\nfamily of topological semimetals. Both bulk and surface bands are present in\nthe spectra. The dispersion of the surface state is highly unusual. It\nresembles a Dirac cone, but upon closer inspection we can clearly detect an\nenergy gap. The bottom band follows roughly a parabolic dispersion. The\ndispersion of the top band remains very linear, \"V\" shape like, with the tip\napproaching very closely to the extrapolated location of Dirac point. Such\nasymmetric mass acquisition is highly unusual and opens a possibility of a new\ntopological phenomena that has yet to be understood.\n", "  We study a three-dimensional ($3D$) liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) in the\ncontext of Finsler geometry (FG) modeling, where FG is a mathematical framework\nfor describing anisotropic phenomena. The LCE is a $3D$ rubbery object and has\nremarkable properties, such as the so-called soft elasticity and elongation,\nthe mechanisms of which are unknown at present. To understand these anisotropic\nphenomena, we introduce a variable $\\sigma$, which represents the directional\ndegrees of freedom of a liquid crystal (LC) molecule. This variable $\\sigma$ is\nused to define the Finsler metric for the interaction between the LC molecules\nand bulk polymers. Performing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a cylindrical\nbody between two parallel plates, we numerically find the soft elasticity in MC\ndata such that the tensile stress and strain are consistent with reported\nexperimental results. Moreover, the elongation is also observed in the results\nof MC simulations of a spherical body with free boundaries, and the data\nobtained from the MC simulations are also consistent with existing experimental\nresults.\n", "  Thanks to the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI), HgTe-based quantum wells\n(QWs) exhibit very rich spin-related properties. But the full descriptions of\nthem are beyond the simple parabolic band models and conventional Rashba and\nDresselhaus SOI terms, as a result of the strong interband coupling of the\nnarrow gap band structures. Here, we develop a theoretical method to calculate\nthe circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in\nHg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te/HgTe/Hg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te quantum wells (HgTe QWs)\nbased on the realistic eight-band $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ model with\ndensity matrix formalism. Our method could take account of the unusual band\nstructures and SOIs of HgTe QWs, therefore can be used to calculate the CPGE\ncurrents in HgTe QWs with non-parabolic, Dirac-like and inverted energy\ndispersions. The microscopic origin of CPGE and the interplay effect of\nstructure inversion asymmetry (SIA) and bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) is also\ninvestigated. In addition, this method is extended to study the pure spin\ncurrents (PSCs) in HgTe QWs injected by linearly polarized light at normal\nincidence. Our calculation results support the following findings: (i) In the\ninverted phase regime, the energy dispersion of heavily inverted HgTe QWs could\nbe strongly distorted, lead to a significant enhancement of CPGE at a certain\nrange of energy spectrum. (ii) The interplay of SIA and BIA could lead to the\nCPGE currents anisotropically dependent on the azimuth angle of oblique\nincident light. (iii) The PSC $j_{y'}^{x'}$ ($x'\\parallel[110]$ and\n$y'\\parallel[\\bar{1}10]$) produced by [110]-linearly-polarized light could\nchange sign with HgTe QW transformed from normal phase to inverted phase. These\nfindings might be utilized in developing the HgTe-based infrared/terahertz\noptoelectronic and spintronic devices.\n", "  We characterize the 795 nm $^3$H$_6$ to $^3$H$_4$ transition of Tm$^{3+}$ in\na Ti$^{4+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$ waveguide at temperatures as low as 800 mK. Coherence\nand hyperfine population lifetimes -- up to 117 $\\mu$s and 2.5 hours,\nrespectively -- exceed those at 3 K at least ten-fold, and are equivalent to\nthose observed in a bulk Tm$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$ crystal under similar\nconditions. We also find a transition dipole moment that is equivalent to that\nof the bulk. Finally, we prepare a 0.5 GHz-bandwidth atomic frequency comb of\nfinesse $>$2 on a vanishing background. These results demonstrate the\nsuitability of rare-earth-doped waveguides created using industry-standard\nTi-indiffusion in LiNbO$_3$ for on-chip quantum applications.\n", "  The Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional exterior domain are\nconsidered. The asymptotic stability of stationary solutions satisfying a\ngeneral hypothesis is proven under any $L^2$-perturbation. In particular the\ngeneral hypothesis is valid if the steady solution is the sum of the critically\ndecaying flux carrier with flux $|\\Phi| < 2\\pi$ and a small subcritically\ndecaying term. Under the central symmetry assumption, the general hypothesis is\nalso proven for any critically decaying steady solutions under a suitable\nsmallness condition.\n", "  We use high resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density\nfunctional theory with experimentally obtained crystal structure parameters to\nstudy the electronic properties of CaKFe4As4. In contrast to related CaFe2As2\ncompounds, CaKFe4As4 has high Tc of 35K at stochiometric composition. This\npresents unique opportunity to study properties of high temperature\nsuperconductivity of iron arsenic superconductors in absence of doping or\nsubstitution. The Fermi surface consists of three hole pockets at $\\Gamma$ and\ntwo electron pockets at the $M$ point. We find that the values of the\nsuperconducting gap are nearly isotropic, but significantly different for each\nof the FS sheets. Most importantly we find that the overall momentum dependence\nof the gap magnitudes plotted across the entire Brillouin zone displays a\nstrong deviation from the simple cos(kx)cos(ky) functional form of the gap\nfunction, proposed in the scenario of the Cooper-pairing driven by a short\nrange antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Instead, the maximum value of the\ngap is observed for FS sheets that are closest to the ideal nesting condition\nin contrast to the previous observations in some other ferropnictides. These\nresults provide strong support for the multiband character of superconductivity\nin CaKFe4As4, in which Cooper pairing forms on the electron and the hole bands\ninteracting via dominant interband repulsive interaction, enhanced by FS\nnesting}.\n", "  People are observed to assortatively connect on a set of traits. This\nphenomenon, termed assortative mixing or sometimes homophily, can be quantified\nthrough assortativity coefficient in social networks. Uncovering the exact\ncauses of strong assortative mixing found in social networks has been a\nresearch challenge. Among the main suggested causes from sociology are the\ntendency of similar individuals to connect (often itself referred as homophily)\nand the social influence among already connected individuals. An important\nquestion to researchers and in practice can be tackled, as we present here:\nunderstanding the exact mechanisms of interplay between these tendencies and\nthe underlying social network structure. Namely, in addition to the mentioned\nassortativity coefficient, there are several other static and temporal network\nproperties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily\nand social influence in the social network and we herein investigate those.\nConcretely, we tackle a computer-mediated \\textit{communication network} (based\non Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be\ninferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term\n\\textit{semantic homophily}. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the\nfirst to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication\nnetwork and the interplay between them. We quantify diverse levels of semantic\nhomophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed\nhomophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and finally, we present its\nintricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter. By analyzing\nthese mechanisms we increase understanding on what are the semantic aspects\nthat shape and how they shape the human computer-mediated communication.\n", "  Lyman-alpha forest data probing the post-reionization Universe shows\nsurprisingly large opacity fluctuations over rather large ($\\ge$50 comoving\nMpc/h) spatial scales. We model these fluctuations using a hybrid approach\nutilizing the large volume Millennium simulation to predict the spatial\ndistribution of QSOs combined with smaller scale full hydrodynamical simulation\nperformed with RAMSES and post-processed with the radiative transfer code ATON.\nWe produce realictic mock absorption spectra that account for the contribution\nof galaxies and QSOs to the ionising UV background. This improved models\nconfirm our earlier findings that a significant ($\\ge$50%) contribution of\nionising photons from QSOs can explain the large reported opacity fluctuations\non large scales. The inferred QSO luminosity function is thereby consistent\nwith recent estimates of the space density of QSOs at this redshift. Our\nsimulations still somewhat struggle, however, to reproduce the very long (110\ncomoving Mpc/h) high opacity absorption through observed in ULAS J0148+0600,\nperhaps suggesting an even later end of reionization than assumed in our\npreviously favoured model. Medium-deep/medium area QSO surveys as well as\ntargeted searches for the predicted strong transverse QSO proximity effect\nwhould illuminate the origin of the observed large scale opacity fluctuations.\nThey would allow to substantiate whether UV fluctuations due to QSO are indeed\nprimarily responsible, or whether significant contributions from other recently\nproposed mechansims such as large scale fluctuations in temperature and mean\nfree path (even in the absence of rare bright sources) are required.\n", "  We study the relation between the partition function of a non--relativistic\nparticle, that describes the equilibrium fluctuations implicitly, and the\npartition function of the same system, deduced from the Langevin equation, that\ndescribes the fluctuations explicitly, of a bath with additive white--noise\nproperties. We show that both can be related to the partition function of an\n${\\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetric theory with one--dimensional bosonic\nworldvolume and that they can all describe the same physics, since the\ncorrelation functions of the observables satisfy the same identities for all\nsystems.The supersymmetric theory provides the consistent closure for\ndescribing the fluctuations, even though supersymmetry may be broken, when\ntheir backreaction is taken into account. The trajectory of the classical\nparticle becomes a component of a superfield, when fluctuations are taken into\naccount. These statements can be tested by the identities the correlation\nfunctions satisfy, by using a lattice regularization of an action that\ndescribes commuting fields only.\n", "  In this paper we present a construction of effective cosmological models\nwhich describe the propagation of a massive quantum scalar field on a quantum\nanisotropic cosmological spacetime. Each obtained effective model is\nrepresented by a rainbow metric in which particles of distinct momenta\npropagate on different classical geometries. Our analysis shows that upon\ncertain assumptions and conditions on the parameters determining such\nanisotropic models, we surprisingly obtain a unique deformation parameter\n$\\beta$ in the modified dispersion relation of the modes. Hence inducing an\nisotropic deformation despite the general starting considerations. We then\nensure the recovery of the dispersion relation realized in the isotropic case,\nstudied in [arXiv:1412.6000], when some proper symmetry constraints are\nimposed, and we estimate the value of the deformation parameter for this case\nin loop quantum cosmology context.\n", "  The Belle II experiment currently under construction at the $e^+e^-$-collider\nSuperKEKB in Japan is designed to explore new physics beyond the standard model\nwith an approximately 50 times larger data sample compared to its predecessor.\nThe vertex detector (VXD), comprising a two layer DEPFET pixel detector (PXD)\nsurrounded by four layers of double sided silicon strip detector (SVD), is\nindispensable for the accurate determination of the decay point of $B$ or $D$\nmeson as well as track reconstruction of low momentum particles. The DEPFET\nsensors in Belle II are thinned down to 75 $\\mu$m with low power consumption\nand low intrinsic noise. In the DEPFET concept, the front-end electronics is\nplaced outside of the sensitive area, and thus no cooling components are\nnecessary inside the physics acceptance of the detector. Evaporative two-phase\nCO$_2$ cooling in combination with forced air flow has been chosen as the\nscheme for the PXD cooling. To guarantee the DEPFET detector operation\ncondition and verify the cooling concept, a PXD mockup is constructed at DESY.\nStudies of the thermal and mechanical performance are presented in this paper.\n", "  Fabrication and operation of simple solid state electrochromic devices using\nethyl viologen diperchlorate in a polymer matrix is presented here. In-situ\nRaman and transmission/absorption studies have been done to establish the\norigin of bias induced color change, between a transparent and navy blue color,\nin the electrochromic device. The origin of bias induced color change has been\nattributed to the bias induced redox switching between its viologen dication\nand free redicle forms. Fundamental reason behind colour changes of viologen\nmolecule has been established. In-situ UV-Vis spectra reveals that the navy\nblue color of the device under biased condition is not due to increase in the\ntransparency corresponding to blue wavelength but due to suppression of the\ntransparency corresponding to the complementary colors. Absorption modulation\nhas been reported from the device with good ON/OFF contrast of the device.\n", "  A weak invariant of a stochastic system is defined in such a way that its\nexpectation value with respect to the distribution function as a solution of\nthe associated Fokker-Planck equation is constant in time. A general formula is\ngiven for time evolution of fluctuations of the invariants. An application to\nthe problem of share price in finance is illustrated. It is shown how this\ntheory makes it possible to reduce the growth rate of the fluctuations.\n", "  The LO hadronic vacuum polarization (VP) contribution to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment $a_\\mu$ is obtained as the integral as a function of energy of\nan expression that involves the ratio of the $e^+e^- \\rightarrow\n\\mathrm{hadron}$ cross section to the pointlike muon pair cross section. The\nformer is extracted from experimental data for individual hadronic final states\nat low energies, and from perturbative QCD at high energies. The BaBar\nexperiment at SLAC has a programme of systematic measurement of the production\nof the lowest-rest-mass hadronic final states, those that contribute most\nsignificantly to the integral. To that purpose, we use a method in which, while\nthe PEP-II storage ring is operated at a constant energy in the center of mass\nsystem, $\\sqrt{s}$, of about 10.6 GeV, events are reconstructed and selected\nwhich have been produced with a hadronic final state together with a\nhigh-energy photon which may (photon tagging) or may not (no tagging) be\nobserved. In our kinematic configuration the photon is almost always emitted by\nthe electron or by the positron of the initial state, hence the name\n\"initial-state radiation\" (ISR). The cross section for the direct $e^+e^-\n\\rightarrow f$ production of a final state $f$ at an energy $\\sqrt{s'}$ is then\nextracted from the differential cross section of the ISR production of the\nstate $f$ with invariant mass $\\sqrt{s'}$. The programme is almost completed\nand has lead to a number of first measurements and to an improvement of up to a\nfactor of three of the uncertainties on the contributions of individual\nchannels to $a_\\mu$.\n", "  We review the concept and properties of finite field-dependent BRST and\nBRST-antiBRST transformations introduced in our recent study (A. Reshetnyak,\nIJMPA 29 (2014) 1450128, P. Moshin, A. Reshetnyak, Nucl. Phys. B 888 (2014) 92,\nPhys.

Exact\nrules for calculating the Jacobian of a corresponding change of variables in\nthe partition function are presented. Infrared peculiarities under\n$R_\\xi$-gauges in the Yang--Mills theory and Standard Model are examined in a\ngauge-invariant way with an appropriate horizon functional and unaffected local\n$N=1,2$ BRST symmetries.\n", "  Single-electron pumps based on isolated impurity atoms have recently been\nexperimentally demonstrated. In these devices the Coulomb potential of an atom\ncreates a localised electron state with a large charging energy and\nconsiderable orbital level spacings, enabling robust charge capturing\nprocesses. In these single-atom pumps, the confinement potential is hardly\naffected by the periodic driving of the system. This is in contrast to the\noften used gate-defined quantum dot pumps, for which a strongly time-dependent\npotential leads to significantly different charge pumping processes. Here we\ndescribe the behaviour and the performance of an atomic, single parameter,\nelectron pump. This is done by considering the loading, isolating and unloading\nof one electron at the time, on a phosphorous atom embedded in a silicon double\ngate transistor. The most important feature of the atom pump is its very\nisolated ground state, which can be populated through the fast loading of much\nhigher lying excited states and a subsequent fast relaxation proces. This leads\nto a substantial increase in pumping accuracy, and is opposed to the adverse\nrole of excited states as observed for quantum dot pumps due to non-adiabatic\nexcitations. The pumping performances are investigated as a function of dopant\nposition, revealing a pumping behaviour robust against the expected variability\nin atomic position.\n", "  In a series of recent papers it has been shown how free quantum field theory\ncan be derived without using mechanical primitives (including space-time,\nspecial relativity, quantization rules, etc.), but only considering the easiest\nquantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum systems whose network\nof interactions satisfies the simple principles of unitarity, homogeneity,\nlocality, and isotropy. This has opened the route to extending the axiomatic\ninformation-theoretic derivation of the quantum theory of abstract systems to\ninclude quantum field theory. The inherent discrete nature of the informational\naxiomatization leads to an extension of quantum field theory to a quantum\ncellular automata theory, where the usual field theory is recovered in a regime\nwhere the discrete structure of the automata cannot be probed. A simple\nheuristic argument sets the scale of discreteness to the Planck scale, and the\ncustomary physical regime where discreteness is not visible is the relativistic\none of small wavevectors. In this paper we provide a thorough derivation from\nprinciples that in the most general case the graph of the quantum cellular\nautomaton is the Cayley graph of a finitely presented group, and showing how\nfor the case corresponding to Euclidean emergent space (where the group resorts\nto an Abelian one) the automata leads to Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell field dynamics\nin the relativistic limit. We conclude with some perspectives towards the more\ngeneral scenario of non-linear automata for interacting quantum field theory.\n", "  With the upcoming sky survey with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope a great\nsample of type Ia supernovae will be observed, allowing for a precise mapping\nof the velocity structure of the universe. Since the source of peculiar\nvelocities is variations in the density field, cosmological parameters related\nto the matter distribution can subsequently be extracted from the velocity\npower spectrum.\n  One way to quantify this is through the angular power spectrum of radial\npeculiar velocities on spheres at different redshifts. We investigate how well\nthis observable can be measured, despite the problems caused by areas with no\ninformation. To obtain a realistic distribution of supernovae, we create mock\nsupernova catalogs by using a semi-analytical code for galaxy formation on the\nmerger trees extracted from N-body simulations. We measure the cosmic variance\nin the velocity power spectrum by repeating the procedure many times for\ndifferently located observers, and vary different aspects of the analysis, such\nas the observer environment, to see how this affects the measurements.\n  Our results confirm the findings from earlier studies regarding the precision\nwith which the angular velocity power spectrum can be determined in the near\nfuture. This level of precision has been found to imply, that the angular\nvelocity power spectrum from type Ia supernovae is competitive in its potential\nto measure parameters such as $\\sigma_8$. This makes the peculiar velocity\npower spectrum from type Ia supernovae a promising new observable, which\ndeserves further attention.\n", "  We propose a novel and simple mechanism where sizable effects of non-standard\ninteractions (NSI) in neutrino propagation are induced from the mixing between\nan electrophilic second Higgs doublet and a charged singlet. The mixing arises\nfrom a dimensionful coupling of the scalar doublet and singlet to the standard\nmodel Higgs boson. In light of the small mass, the light mass eigenstate from\nthe doublet-singlet mixing can generate much larger NSI than those induced by\nthe heavy eigenstate. We show that a sizable NSI $\\varepsilon_{e\\tau}$ ($\\sim\n0.3$) can be attained without being excluded by a variety of experimental\nconstraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NSI can mimic effects of the\nDirac CP phase in the neutrino mixing matrix but they can potentially be\ndisentangled by future long-baseline neutrino experiments, such as the Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).\n", "  We analytically and numerically investigate the properties of s-wave\nholographic superconductors by considering the effects of scalar and gauge\nfields on the background geometry in five dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity. We assume the gauge field to be in the form of the Power-Maxwell\nnonlinear electrodynamics. We employ the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem for\nanalytical calculation of the critical temperature and the shooting method for\nthe numerical investigation. Our numerical and analytical results indicate that\nhigher curvature corrections affect condensation of the holographic\nsuperconductors with backreaction. We observe that the backreaction can\ndecrease the critical temperature of the holographic superconductors, while the\nPower-Maxwell electrodynamics and Gauss-Bonnet coefficient term may increase\nthe critical temperature of the holographic superconductors. We find that the\ncritical exponent has the mean-field value $\\beta=1/2$, regardless of the\nvalues of Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, backreaction and Power-Maxwell parameters.\n", "  Efficient interfaces between photons and quantum emitters form the basis for\nquantum networks and enable nonlinear optical devices operating at the\nsingle-photon level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum\nnanophotonics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to nanoscale\ndiamond devices. By placing SiV centers inside diamond photonic crystal\ncavities, we realize a quantum-optical switch controlled by a single color\ncenter. We control the switch using SiV metastable orbital states and verify\noptical switching at the single-photon level by using photon correlation\nmeasurements. We use Raman transitions to realize a single-photon source with a\ntunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide. Finally, we create\nentanglement between two SiV centers by detecting indistinguishable Raman\nphotons emitted into a single waveguide. Entanglement is verified using a novel\nsuperradiant feature observed in photon correlation measurements, paving the\nway for the realization of quantum networks.\n", "  We derive the next-to-leading order correction to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel starting from quantum chromodynamics. So, we are able to fix the\nconstants of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model from quantum chromodynamics and\nanalyze the behavior of strong interactions at low energies. The technique is\nto expand in powers of currents the generating functional. We apply it to a\nsimple Yukawa model with self-interaction showing how this has a\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model and its higher order corrections as a low-energy\nlimit. The same is shown to happen for quantum chromodynamics in the chiral\nlimit with two quarks. We prove that a consistent thermodynamic behaviour is\nobtained as expected for the given parameters.\n", "  We study nonequilibrium thermoelectric transport properties of a correlated\nimpurity connected to two leads for temperatures below the Kondo scale. At\nfinite bias, for which a current flows across the leads, we investigate the\ndifferential response of the current to a temperature gradient. In particular,\nwe compare the influence of a bias voltage and of a finite temperature on this\nthermoelectric response. This is of interest from a fundamental point of view\nto better understand the two different decoherence mechanisms produced by a\nbias voltage and by temperature. Our results show that in this respect the\nthermoelectric response behaves differently from the electric conductance. In\nparticular, while the latter displays a similar qualitative behavior as a\nfunction of voltage and temperature, both in theoretical and experimental\ninvestigations, qualitative differences occur in the case of the thermoelectric\nresponse. In order to understand this effect, we analyze the different\ncontributions in connection to the behavior of the impurity spectral function\nversus temperature. Especially in the regime of strong interactions and large\nenough bias voltages we obtain a simple picture based on the asymmetric\nsuppression or enhancement of the split Kondo peaks as a function of the\ntemperature gradient. Besides the academic interest, these studies could\nadditionally provide valuable information to assess the applicability of\nquantum dot devices as responsive nanoscale temperature sensors.\n", "  Agreement between theoretical calculations of atomic structure and\nspectroscopic measurements is used to constrain possible contribution of exotic\nspin-dependent interactions between electrons to the energy differences between\nstates in helium-4. In particular, constraints on dipole-dipole interactions\nassociated with the exchange of pseudoscalar bosons (such as axions or\naxion-like particles, ALPs) with masses $10^{-2}~{\\rm eV} \\lesssim m \\lesssim\n10^{4}~{\\rm eV}$ are improved by a factor of $\\sim 100$. The first atomic-scale\nconstraints on several exotic velocity-dependent dipole-dipole interactions are\nestablished as well.\n", "  Hybrid kinetic-MHD models describe the interaction of an MHD bulk fluid with\nan ensemble of hot particles, which is described by a kinetic equation. When\nthe Vlasov description is adopted for the energetic particles, different\nVlasov-MHD models have been shown to lack an exact energy balance, which was\nrecently recovered by the introduction of non-inertial force terms in the\nkinetic equation. These force terms arise from fundamental approaches based on\nHamiltonian and variational methods. In this work we apply Hamilton's\nvariational principle to formulate new current-coupling kinetic-MHD models in\nthe low-frequency approximation (i.e. large Larmor frequency limit). More\nparticularly, we formulate current-coupling hybrid schemes, in which energetic\nparticle dynamics are expressed in either guiding-center or gyrocenter\ncoordinates.\n", "  We consider quantum channel-estimation for depolarizing channels and\nphase-flip channels extended by ancilla qubits and fed with a GHZ or W state.\nAfter application of the channel one or several qubits can be lost, and we\ncalculate the impact of the loss on the quantum Fisher information that\ndetermines the smallest uncertainty with which the parameters of these channels\ncan be estimated.\n", "  It has recently been shown that some integrable spin chains possess a set of\nquasilocal conserved charges, with the classic example being the\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ Heisenberg chain. These charges have been proven to be\nessential for properly describing stationary states after a quantum quench, and\nmust be included in the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We find that similar\ncharges are also necessary for the GGE description of integrable quantum field\ntheories with non-diagonal scattering. A stationary state in a non-diagonal\nscattering theory is completely specified by fixing the mode-ocuppation density\ndistributions of physical particles, as well auxiliary particles which carry no\nenergy or momentum. We show that the set of conserved charges with integer\nLorentz spin, related to the integrability of the model, are unable to fix the\ndistributions of these auxiliary particles, since these charges can only fix\nkinematical properties of physical particles. The field theory analogs of\nquasilocal lattice charges are therefore necessary. As a concrete example, we\nfind the complete set of charges needed in the sine-Gordon model, by using the\nfact that this field theory is recovered as the continuum limit of a spatially\ninhomogeneous version of the XXZ chain. The set of quasilocal charges of the\nlattice theory are shown to become a set local charges with fractional spin in\nthe field theory.\n", "  We prove that in the reduced quartic BCS model with an imaginary external\nmagnetic field a spontaneous U(1)-symmetry breaking (SSB) and an off-diagonal\nlong range order (ODLRO) occur. The system is defined on a hyper-cubic lattice\nwith periodic boundary conditions at positive temperature. In the free part of\nthe Hamiltonian we assume the nearest-neighbor hopping. The chemical potential\nis fixed so that the free Fermi surface does not degenerate. The term\nrepresenting the interaction between electrons' spin and the imaginary external\nmagnetic field is the z-component of the spin operator multiplied by a pure\nimaginary parameter. The SSB and the ODLRO are shown in the infinite-volume\nlimit of the thermal average over the full Fermionic Fock space. The magnitude\nof the negative coupling constant must be larger than a certain value so that\nthe gap equation is solvable. The gap equation is different from that of the\nconventional mean field BCS model because of the presence of the imaginary\nmagnetic field. By adjusting the imaginary magnetic field this model shows the\nSSB and the ODLRO in high temperature, weak coupling regimes where the\nconventional reduced BCS model does not show these phenomena. The proof is\nbased on Grassmann Gaussian integral formulations and a double-scale\nintegration scheme to analytically control the formulations.\n", "  The Rashba physics has been intensively studied in the field of spin\norbitronics, for the purpose of searching novel physical properties and the FM\nmagnetization switching for technology applications. Here, we report the\nobservation of the inverse Edelstein effect up to room temperature in the\nRashba-split 2DEG between two insulating oxides SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 with the\nLaAlO3 layer thickness from 3 to 40 unit cells (UC). We further demonstrate\nthat the spin voltage could be dramatically manipulated by electric field\neffect for the 2DEG between SrTiO3 and 3 UC LaAlO3. These results demonstrate\nthat the Rashba-split 2DEG at the complex oxide interface can be used for room\ntemperature efficient charge-and-spin conversion for the generation and\ndetection of spin current.\n", "  A first attempt to apply the AdS/QCD framework for a bottom-up approach to\nthe evaluation of the effective cross section for double parton scattering in\nproton-proton collisions is presented. The main goal is the analytic evaluation\nof the dependence of the effective cross section on the longitudinal momenta of\nthe involved partons, obtained within the holographic Soft-Wall model. If\nmeasured in high-energy processes at hadron colliders, this momentum dependence\ncould open a new window on 2-parton correlations in a proton.\n", "  In this work, we systematically study the mass spectra and strong decays of\n$1P$ and $2S$ charmed and charmed-strange baryons in the framework of\nnonrelativistic constituent quark models. With the light quark cluster-heavy\nquark picture, the masses are simply calculated by a potential model. The\nstrong decays are studied by the Eichten-Hill-Quigg decay formula. Masses and\ndecay properties of the well-established $1S$ and $1P$ states can be reproduced\nby our method. $\\Sigma_c(2800)^{0,+,++}$ can be assigned as a\n$\\Sigma_{c2}(3/2^-)$ or $\\Sigma_{c2}(5/2^-)$ state. We prefer to interpret the\nsignal $\\Sigma_c(2850)^0$ as a $2S(1/2^+)$ state although at present we cannot\nthoroughly exclude the possibility that this is the same state as\n$\\Sigma_c(2800)^0$. $\\Lambda_c(2765)^+$ or $\\Sigma_c(2765)^+$ could be\nexplained as the $\\Lambda_c^+(2S)$ state or $\\Sigma^+_{c1}(1/2^-)$ state,\nrespectively. We propose to measure the branching ratio of\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\Sigma_c(2455)\\pi)/\\mathcal{B}(\\Sigma_c(2520)\\pi)$ in future,\nwhich may disentangle the puzzle of this state. Our results support\n$\\Xi_c(2980)^{0,+}$ as the first radial excited state of $\\Xi_c(2470)^{0,+}$\nwith $J^P=1/2^+$. The assignment of $\\Xi_c(2930)^0$ is analogous to\n$\\Sigma_c(2800)^{0,+,++}$, \\emph{i.e.}, a $\\Xi^\\prime_{c2}(3/2^-)$ or\n$\\Xi^\\prime_{c2}(5/2^-)$ state. In addition, we predict some typical ratios\namong partial decay widths, which are valuable for experimental search for\nthese missing charmed and charmed-strange baryons.\n", "  The concept of a supersolid state is paradoxical. It combines the\ncrystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it\nis built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous\nsymmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous\ntranslational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50\nyears ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A\nvariant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed\nlattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice\nsupersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that\ncharacterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the\nrealization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking.\nThe continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically\ncoupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase\ncoherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by\nmeasuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields\nleaking from the cavities. These light fields are also used to monitor the\nposition fluctuations in real-time. Our concept provides a route to creating\nand studying glassy many-body systems with contrallably lifted ground-state\ndegeneracies, such as supersolids in the presence of disorder.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate the existence of orbital angular momentum (OAM)\nbright and dark supermodes in a three-evanescently coupled cylindrical\nwaveguides system. Bright and dark supermodes are characterized by their\ncoupling and decoupling from one of the waveguides, respectively. In addition,\nwe demonstrate that complex couplings between modes of different waveguides\nappear naturally due to the characteristic spiral phase-front of OAM modes in\ntwo-dimensional configurations where the waveguides are arranged forming a\ntriangle. Finally, by adding dissipation to the waveguide uncoupled to the dark\nsupermode, we are able to filter it out, allowing for the design of OAM mode\nclonners and inverters.\n", "  We propose two different and complementary observables for singling out\npossible signals of physics beyond the standard model in the semi-leptonic\ndecays $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c \\ell{\\bar \\nu}_{\\ell}$, both with the $\\tau$\nlepton and with a light lepton. The two observables are the partial decay width\nand a T-odd asymmetry, whose respective sensitivities to scalar and/or\npseudo-scalar coupling are calculated as functions of the parameters\ncharacterizing new physics. Two different form factors are used. Three\nparticular cases are discussed and analyzed in detail.\n", "  When nano-magnets are coupled to random external sources, their magnetization\nbecomes a random variable, whose properties are defined by an induced\nprobability density, that can be reconstructed from its moments, using the\nLangevin equation, for mapping the noise to the dynamical degrees of freedom.\nWhen the spin dynamics is discretized in time, a general\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem, valid for non-Markovian noise, can be\nestablished, even when zero modes are present. We discuss the subtleties that\narise, when Gilbert damping is present and the mapping between noise and spin\ndegrees of freedom is non--linear.\n", "  MoTe$_2$ is an exfoliable transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) which\ncrystallizes in three symmetries, the semiconducting trigonal-prismatic\n$2H-$phase, the semimetallic $1T^{\\prime}$ monoclinic phase, and the\nsemimetallic orthorhombic $T_d$ structure. The $2H-$phase displays a band gap\nof $\\sim 1$ eV making it appealing for flexible and transparent\noptoelectronics. The $T_d-$phase is predicted to possess unique topological\nproperties which might lead to topologically protected non-dissipative\ntransport channels. Recently, it was argued that it is possible to locally\ninduce phase-transformations in TMDs, through chemical doping, local heating,\nor electric-field to achieve ohmic contacts or to induce useful functionalities\nsuch as electronic phase-change memory elements. The combination of\nsemiconducting and topological elements based upon the same compound, might\nproduce a new generation of high performance, low dissipation optoelectronic\nelements. Here, we show that it is possible to engineer the phases of MoTe$_2$\nthrough W substitution by unveiling the phase-diagram of the\nMo$_{1-x}$W$_x$Te$_2$ solid solution which displays a semiconducting to\nsemimetallic transition as a function of $x$. We find that only $\\sim 8$ \\% of\nW stabilizes the $T_d-$phase at room temperature. Photoemission spectroscopy,\nindicates that this phase possesses a Fermi surface akin to that of WTe$_2$.\n", "  We have carried out the growth of h-RFeO3 (001) (R=Lu, Yb) thin films on\nFe3O4 (111)/Al2O3 (001) substrates, and studied the effect of the h-RFeO3\n(001)/Fe3O4 (111) interfaces on the epitaxy and magnetism. The observed\nepitaxial relations between h-RFeO3 and Fe3O4 indicates an unusual matching of\nFe sub-lattices rather than a matching of O sub-lattices. The out-of-plane\ndirection was found to be the easy magnetic axis for h-YbFeO3 (001) but the\nhard axis for Fe3O4 (111) in the h-YbFeO3 (001)/Fe3O4 (111)/Al2O3 (001) films,\nsuggesting a perpendicular magnetic alignment at the h-YbFeO3 (001)/Fe3O4 (111)\ninterface. These results indicate that Fe3O4 (111)/Al2O3 (001) could be a\npromising substrate for epitaxial growth of h-RFeO3 films of well-defined\ninterface and for exploiting their spintronic properties.\n", "  Experimental progress with meso- and macroscopic quantum states (i.e.,\ngeneral Schrodinger-cat states) was recently accompanied by theoretical\nproposals on how to measure the merit of these efforts. So far, experiment and\ntheory were disconnected as theoretical analysis of actual experimental data\nwas missing. Here, we consider a proposal for macroscopic quantum states that\nmeasures the extend of quantum coherence present in the system. For this, the\nquantum Fisher information is used. We calculate lower bounds from real\nexperimental data. The results are expressed as an \"effective size\", that is,\nrelative to \"classical\" reference states. We find remarkable numbers of up to\n70 in photonic and atomic systems.\n", "  The modes of silicon meta-atoms are investigated, motivated by their use as\nbuilding blocks of Huygens' metasurfaces. A model based on these modes is\npresented, giving a clear physical explanation of all features in the\nextinction spectrum. Counter-intuitively, this can show negative contributions\nto extinction, which are shown to arise from the interference between\nnon-orthogonal modes. The direct and interference contributions to extinction\nare determined, showing that conservation of energy is preserved. The Huygens'\ncondition of matched electric and magnetic dipole moments leads to strong\nforward scattering and suppressed back scattering. It is shown that higher\norder modes with appropriate symmetry generalise this condition, leading to\nmultiple bands of directional scattering. The presented results are obtained\nusing a robust approach to find the modes of nano-photonic scatterers, commonly\nreferred to as quasi-normal modes. By utilising an integral formulation of\nMaxwell's equations, this work avoids the problem of normalising diverging\nfar-fields, which other approaches require. The model and presented results are\nimplemented in open-source code.\n", "  The resistance of the electron gas at the interface between the two band\ninsulators LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO) typically drops monotonically with\ntemperature and R/T curves during cooling and warm-up look identical for large\narea structures. Here we show that if the LAO/STO is laterally restricted by\nnanopatterning the resistance exhibits a temperature anomaly. Warming up\nnanostructures from low temperatures leads to one or two pronounced resistance\npeaks between 50 and 100 K not observed for larger dimensions. During cool-down\ncurrent filaments emerge at the domain walls that form during the well-known\nstructural phase transition of the STO substrate. During warm-up the reverse\nphase transition can interrupt filaments before the sheet conductivity which\ndominates at higher temperature is reestablished. Due to the limited number of\nfilaments in a nanostructure this process can result in a complete loss of\nconductance. As a consequence of these findings the transport physics extracted\nfrom experiments in small and large area LAO/STO structures may need to be\nreconsidered.\n", "  Measurements of multi-particle correlations in the collisions of small\nsystems such as $p+p$, $p/d/^3He+A$ show striking similarity to the\nobservations in heavy ion collisions. A number of observables measured in the\nhigh multiplicity events of these systems resemble features that are attributed\nto collectivity driven by hydrodynamics. However alternative explanations based\non initial state dynamics are able to describe many characteristic features of\nthese measurements. In this brief review we highlight some of the recent\ndevelopments and outstanding issues in this direction.\n", "  We present a flexible template-based photometric redshift estimation\nframework, implemented in C#, that can be seamlessly integrated into a SQL\ndatabase (or DB) server and executed on-demand in SQL. The DB integration\neliminates the need to move large photometric datasets outside a database for\nredshift estimation, and utilizes the computational capabilities of DB\nhardware. The code is able to perform both maximum likelihood and Bayesian\nestimation, and can handle inputs of variable photometric filter sets and\ncorresponding broad-band magnitudes. It is possible to take into account the\nfull covariance matrix between filters, and filter zero points can be\nempirically calibrated using measurements with given redshifts. The list of\nspectral templates and the prior can be specified flexibly, and the expensive\nsynthetic magnitude computations are done via lazy evaluation, coupled with a\ncaching of results. Parallel execution is fully supported. For large upcoming\nphotometric surveys such as the LSST, the ability to perform in-place photo-z\ncalculation would be a significant advantage. Also, the efficient handling of\nvariable filter sets is a necessity for heterogeneous databases, for example\nthe Hubble Source Catalog, and for cross-match services such as SkyQuery. We\nillustrate the performance of our code on two reference photo-z estimation\ntesting datasets, and provide an analysis of execution time and scalability\nwith respect to different configurations. The code is available for download at\nhttps://github.com/beckrob/Photo-z-SQL.\n", "  We investigate the stationary-state fluctuations of a growing one-dimensional\ninterface described by the KPZ dynamics with a noise featuring smooth spatial\ncorrelations of characteristic range $\\xi$. We employ Non-perturbative\nFunctional Renormalization Group methods in order to resolve the properties of\nthe system at all scales. We show that the physics of the standard\n(uncorrelated) KPZ equation emerges on large scales independently of $\\xi$.\nMoreover, the Renormalization Group flow is followed from the initial condition\nto the fixed point, that is from the microscopic dynamics to the large-distance\nproperties. This provides access to the small-scale features (and their\ndependence on the details of the noise correlations) as well as to the\nuniversal large-scale physics. In particular, we compute the kinetic energy\nspectrum of the stationary state as well as its non-universal amplitude. The\nlatter is experimentally accessible by measurements at large scales and retains\na signature of the microscopic noise correlations. Our results are compared to\nprevious analytical and numerical results from independent approaches. They are\nin agreement with direct numerical simulations for the kinetic energy spectrum\nas well as with the prediction, obtained with the replica trick by Gaussian\nvariational method, of a crossover in $\\xi$ of the non-universal amplitude of\nthis spectrum.\n", "  We study a bipartite linear chain constituted by spherical metallic\nnanoparticles, where each nanoparticle supports a localized surface plasmon.\nThe near-field dipolar interaction between the localized surface plasmons gives\nrise to collective plasmons, which are extended over the whole nanoparticle\narray. We derive analytically the spectrum and the eigenstates of the\ncollective plasmonic excitations. At the edge of the Brillouin zone, the\nspectrum is of a pseudorelativistic nature similar to that present in the\nelectronic band structure of polyacetylene. We find the effective Dirac\nHamiltonian for the collective plasmons and show that the corresponding spinor\neigenstates represent one-dimensional Dirac-like massive bosonic excitations.\nTherefore, the plasmonic lattice exhibits similar effects to those found for\nelectrons in one-dimensional Dirac materials, such as the ability for\ntransmission with highly suppressed backscattering due to Klein tunneling. We\nalso show that the system is governed by a nontrivial Zak phase, which predicts\nthe manifestation of edge states in the chain. When two dimerized chains with\ndifferent topological phases are connected, we find the appearance of the\nbosonic version of a Jackiw-Rebbi midgap state. We further investigate the\nradiative and nonradiative lifetimes of the collective plasmonic excitations\nand comment on the challenges for experimental realization of the topological\neffects found theoretically.\n", "  A precision measurement of jet cross sections in neutral current\ndeep-inelastic scattering for photon virtualities $5.5<Q^2<80\\,{\\rm GeV}^2$ and\ninelasticities $0.2<y<0.6$ is presented, using data taken with the H1 detector\nat HERA, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $290\\,{\\rm pb}^{-1}$.\nDouble-differential inclusive jet, dijet and trijet cross sections are measured\nsimultaneously and are presented as a function of jet transverse momentum\nobservables and as a function of $Q^2$. Jet cross sections normalised to the\ninclusive neutral current DIS cross section in the respective $Q^2$-interval\nare also determined. Previous results of inclusive jet cross sections in the\nrange $150<Q^2<15\\,000\\,{\\rm GeV}^2$ are extended to low transverse jet momenta\n$5<P_{T}^{\\rm jet}<7\\,{\\rm GeV}$. The data are compared to predictions from\nperturbative QCD in next-to-leading order in the strong coupling, in\napproximate next-to-next-to-leading order and in full next-to-next-to-leading\norder. Using also the recently published H1 jet data at high values of $Q^2$,\nthe strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s(M_Z)$ is determined in next-to-leading\norder.\n", "  Two searches for new phenomena in final states containing a same-flavour\nopposite-lepton (electron or muon) pair, jets, and large missing transverse\nmomentum are presented. These searches make use of proton--proton collision\ndata, collected during 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=13$\nTeV by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, which correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 14.7 fb$^{-1}$. Both searches target the pair\nproduction of supersymmetric particles, squarks or gluinos, which decay to\nfinal states containing a same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair via one of two\nmechanisms: a leptonically decaying Z boson in the final state, leading to a\npeak in the dilepton invariant-mass distribution around the Z boson mass; and\ndecays of neutralinos (e.g. $\\tilde{\\chi}_2^0 \\rightarrow \\ell^+\\ell^-\n\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$), yielding a kinematic endpoint in the dilepton\ninvariant-mass spectrum. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard\nModel expectation. Results are interpreted in simplified models of gluino-pair\n(squark-pair) production, and provide sensitivity to gluinos (squarks) with\nmasses as large as 1.70 TeV (980 GeV).\n", "  We study the role of composite operators in the Asymptotic Safety program for\nquantum gravity. By including in the effective average action an explicit\ndependence on new sources we are able to keep track of operators which do not\nbelong to the exact theory space and/or are normally discarded in a truncation.\nTypical examples are geometric operators such as volumes, lengths, or geodesic\ndistances. We show that this set-up allows to investigate the scaling\nproperties of various interesting operators via a suitable exact\nrenormalization group equation. We test our framework in several settings,\nincluding Quantum Einstein Gravity, the conformally reduced Einstein-Hilbert\ntruncation, and two dimensional quantum gravity. Finally, we briefly argue that\nour construction paves the way to approach observables in the Asymptotic Safety\nprogram.\n", "  Stable oxide topological insulators (TIs) that could bring together the\ntraditional oxide functionalities with the dissipationless surface states of\nTIs have been sought for years but none was found. Yet, heavier chalcogenides\n(selenides, tellurides) were readily found to be TIs. We clarify here the basic\ncontradiction between TI-ness and stability which is maximal for oxides, and\ntrace the basic design principles necessary to identify the window of\nopportunity of stable TIs. We first identify the electronic motif that can\nachieve topological band inversion (\"topological gene\") in ABO3 as being a\nlone-pair electron-rich B atom (e.g. Te, I, Bi) at the octahedral site. We then\nillustrate that poorly screened oxide systems with large inversion energies can\nundergo energy-lowering atomic distortions that remove the band inversion. We\nidentify the coexistence windows of TI functionality and structure stability\nfor different pressures and find that the common cubic ABO3 structures have\ninversion energies lying outside this coexistence window at zero pressure but\ncould be moved into the coexistence window at moderate pressures. Our study\ndemonstrates the interplay between topological band inversion and structural\nstability and traces the basic principles needed to design stable oxide\ntopological insulators at ambient pressures.\n", "  Internal contaminations of $^{238}$U, $^{235}$U and $^{232}$Th in the bulk of\nhigh purity germanium detectors are potential backgrounds for experiments\nsearching for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{76}$Ge. The data from GERDA\nPhase~I have been analyzed for alpha events from the decay chain of these\ncontaminations by looking for full decay chains and for time correlations\nbetween successive decays in the same detector. No candidate events for a full\nchain have been found. Upper limits on the activities in the range of a few\nnBq/kg for $^{226}$Ra, $^{227}$Ac and $^{228}$Th, the long-lived daughter\nnuclides of $^{238}$U, $^{235}$U and $^{232}$Th, respectively, have been\nderived. With these upper limits a background index in the energy region of\ninterest from $^{226}$Ra and $^{228}$Th contamination is estimated which\nsatisfies the prerequisites of a future ton scale germanium double beta decay\nexperiment.\n", "  Multiple types of high quality neutron detectors are proposed for the first\nphase of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), which will be commissioned\nin 2018. Considering the shortage of 3He supply, a detector module composed of\n49 boron-coated straws (BCS) was developed by Proportional Technologies Inc.\n(PTI). Each straw has a length of 1000 mm and a diameter of 7.5 mm. Seven\nstraws are tightly packed in a tube, and seven tubes are organized in a row to\nform a detector module. The charge division method is used for longitudinal\npositioning. A specific readout system was utilized to output the signal and\nsimultaneously encode each straw. The performance of this detector module was\nstudied using a moderated 252Cf source at the Institute of High Energy Physics\n(IHEP). The signal amplitude spectrum indicates its n-gamma discrimination\ncapability. Despite the complex readout method, a longitudinal resolution of\n6.1-0.5 mm was obtained. The three-dimensional positioning ability qualifies\nthis BCS detector module as a promising neutron scattering spectrometer\ndetector.\n", "  The general theoretical ground for the models based on the compact angle\ncoordinates is presented. It is observed that the proper dependence on compact\ncoordinates has to be through the group elements and is achieved most naturally\nin a discrete-time formulation of the theory. By the construction, the discrete\nworldline inlaid by compact coordinates resembles the spin chains of magnetic\nsystems. As examples, the models based on the groups U(1), $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ and\nSU(2) are explicitly constructed and their exact energy spectra are obtained.\nAs the consequence of minima in the spectra, the models exhibit a phase\ntransition of first-order. The dynamics by U(1) group is attempted to be fitted\nto the proposed role for monopoles in the dual Meissner effect of confinement\nmechanism.\n", "  In this paper, we consider periodicity for space-inhomogeneous quantum walks\non the cycle. For isospectral coin cases, we propose a spectral analysis. Based\non the analysis, we extend the result for periodicity for Hadamard walk to some\nisospectral coin cases. For non-isospectral coin cases, we consider the the\nsystem that uses only one general coin at the origin and the identity coin at\nthe other sites. In this case, we show that the periodicity of the general coin\nat the origin determines the periodicity for the whole system.\n", "  We study analytically the Klein-Gordon wave equation for stationary massive\nscalar fields linearly coupled to spinning Kerr black holes. In particular,\nusing the WKB approximation, we derive a compact formula for the discrete\nspectrum of scalar field masses which characterize the stationary composed\nKerr-black-hole-massive-scalar-field configurations in the large-coupling\nregime $M\\mu\\gg1$ (here $M$ and $\\mu$ are respectively the mass of the central\nblack hole and the proper mass of the scalar field). We confirm our\nanalytically derived formula for the Kerr-scalar-field mass spectrum with\nnumerical data that recently appeared in the literature.\n", "  In this article, we assign the $Y(4274)$ to be the color octet-octet type\naxialvector molecule-like state with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ tentatively, and construct\nthe color octet-octet type axialvector current to study its mass and width with\nthe QCD sum rules in details. The predicted mass favors assigning the $Y(4274)$\nto be the color octet-octet type molecule-like state, but the predicted width\ndisfavors assigning the $Y(4274)$ to be the color octet-octet type\nmolecule-like state strongly. The $Y(4274)$ may be the conventional charmonium\nstate $\\chi_{c1}(\\rm 3P)$, and it is important to observe the decay $Y(4274)\\to\nJ/\\psi \\omega$ to diagnose the nature of the $Y(4274)$.\n", "  A search for new particles has been conducted using events with two high\ntransverse momentum (pt) tau leptons that decay hadronically, at least two\nhigh-pt jets, and missing transverse energy from the tau lepton decays. The\nanalysis is performed using data from proton-proton collisions, collected by\nthe CMS experiment in 2015 at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.1 inverse femtobarns. The results are interpreted in two\nphysics models. The first model involves heavy right-handed neutrinos, N[l] (l\n= e, mu, tau), and right-handed charged bosons, W[R], arising in a left-right\nsymmetric extension of the standard model. Masses of the W[R] boson below 2.35\n(1.63) TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming the N[tau] mass is\n0.8 (0.2) times the mass of the W[R] boson and that only the N[tau] flavor\ncontributes to the W[R] decay width. In the second model, pair production of\nthird-generation scalar leptoquarks that decay into tau tau bb is considered.\nThird-generation scalar leptoquarks with masses below 740 GeV are excluded,\nassuming a 100% branching fraction for the leptoquark decay to a tau lepton and\na bottom quark. This is the first search at hadron colliders for the\nthird-generation Majorana neutrino, as well as the first search for\nthird-generation leptoquarks in the final state with a pair of hadronically\ndecaying tau leptons and jets.\n", "  Alignment of electrostatic potential between different atomic configurations\nis necessary for first-principles calculations of band offsets across\ninterfaces and formation energies of charged defects. However, strong\noscillations of this potential at the atomic scale make alignment challenging,\nespecially when atomic geometries change considerably from bulk to the vicinity\nof defects and interfaces. We introduce a method to suppress these strong\noscillations by eliminating the deep wells in the potential at each atom. We\ndemonstrate that this method considerably improves the system-size convergence\nof a wide range of first-principles predictions that depend on alignment of\nelectrostatic potentials, including band offsets at solid-liquid interfaces,\nand formation energies of charged vacancies in solids and at solid surfaces in\nvacuum. Finally, we use this method in conjunction with continuum solvation\ntheories to investigate energetics of charged vacancies at solid-liquid\ninterfaces. We find that for the example of an NaCl (001) surface in water,\nsolvation reduces the formation energy of charged vacancies by 0.5 eV:\ncalculation of this important effect was previously impractical due to\ncomputational cost in molecular-dynamics methods.\n", "  We investigate the mass fractions and in-medium properties of heavy nuclei in\nstellar matter at characteristic densities and temperatures for supernova (SN)\nexplosions. The individual nuclei are described within the compressible\nliquid-drop model taking into account modifications of bulk, surface and\nCoulomb energies. The equilibrium properties of nuclei and the full ensemble of\nheavy nuclei are calculated self-consistently. It is found that heavy nuclei in\nthe ensemble are either compressed or decompressed depending on the isospin\nasymmetry of the system. The compression or decompression has a little\ninfluence on the binding energies, total mass fractions and average mass\nnumbers of heavy nuclei, although the equilibrium densities of individual\nnuclei themselves are changed appreciably above one hundredth of normal nuclear\ndensity. We find that nuclear structure in single nucleus approximation\ndeviates from the actual one obtained in the multi-nucleus description, since\nthe density of free nucleons is different between these two descriptions. This\nstudy indicates that a multi-nucleus description is required to realistically\naccount for in-medium effects on the nuclear structure in supernova matter.\n", "  The principal pacemaker of the circadian clock of the cyanobacterium S.\nelongatus is a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins,\nKaiA, KaiB and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of\ntwo domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the\nCII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.\nWhile this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven\nthermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.\n", "  We have studied the electronic properties of epitaxial graphene devices\npatterned in a meander shape with the length up to a few centimeters and the\nwidth of few tens of microns. These samples show a pronounced dependence of the\nresistance on temperature. Accurate comparison with theory shows that this\ntemperature dependence originates from the weak localization effect observed\nover a broad temperature range from 1.5 K up to 77 K. The comparison allows us\nto estimate the characteristic times related to quantum interference. In\naddition, a large resistance enhancement with temperature is observed at the\nquantum Hall regime near the filling factor of 2. Record high resistance and\nits strong temperature dependence are favorable for the construction of\nbolometric photodetectors.\n", "  Piezoelectric energy harvester scavenges mechanical vibrations and generates\nelectricity. Researchers have strived to optimize the electromechanical\nstructures and to design necessary external power management circuits, aiming\nto deliver high power and rectified outputs ready for serving as batteries.\nComplex deformation of the mechanical structure results in charges with\nopposite polarities appearing on same surface, leading to current loss in the\nattached metal electrode. External power management circuits such as rectifiers\ncomprise diodes that consume power and have undesirable forward bias. To\naddress the above issues, we devise a novel integrated piezoelectric energy\nharvesting device that is structured by stacking a layer of quantum dots (QDs)\nand a layer of piezoelectric material. We find that the QD can rectify\nelectrical charges generated from the piezoelectric material because of its\nadaptable conductance to the electrochemical potentials of both sides of the\nQDs layer, so that electrical current causing energy loss on the same surface\nof the piezoelectric material can be minimized. The QDs layer has the potential\nto replace external rectification circuits providing a much more compact and\nless power-consumption solution.\n", "  Fluorescent Nuclear Track Detectors (FNTDs) offer a superior, sub-micrometer\nspatial resolution that allows for single particle track detection. However,\nwhen assessing particle fluence from the measured track positions,\ndiscrimination of actual fluence patterns from stochastic fluctuations is\nnecessary due to spatial randomness in particle arrival. This work quantifies\nthe spatial limits of fluence-based dosimetry of (heavy) charged particles and\npresents the use of tools to detect deviation from homogenous (true) fluence in\nmeasured data. It is found that deviations in fluence (and hence dose) on a\npercent level cannot be detected in a carbon beam on scales smaller than\nseveral tens of a millimeter even when using dose levels of 1 Gy. For typical\nfluences measured with FNTDs, read-out area side-lengths should be larger than\n0.2 mm to detect fluence differences of less than 5 %.\n", "  A search for the decays $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D^{(*)0} K^+$ and $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi\nD^{(*)+} K^{*0}$ is performed with data collected at the LHCb experiment\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The decays $B_c^+ \\to\nJ/\\psi D^0 K^+$ and $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D^{*0} K^+$ are observed for the first\ntime, while first evidence is reported for the $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D^{*+} K^{*0}$\nand $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi D^+ K^{*0}$ decays. The branching fractions of these\ndecays are determined relative to the $B_c^+ \\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$ decay. The\n$B_c^+$ mass is measured, using the $J/\\psi D^0 K^+$ final state, to be\n$6274.28 \\pm 1.40 (stat) \\pm 0.32 (syst)$ MeV/$c^2$. This is the most precise\nsingle measurement of the $B_c^+$ mass to date.\n", "  The potential scattering of electrons carrying non--zero quanta of the\norbital angular momentum (OAM) is studied in a framework of the generalized\nBorn approximation, developed in our recent paper by Karlovets \\textit{et al.},\nPhys. Rev. A. {\\textbf 92}, 052703 (2015). We treat these so--called\n\\textit{twisted} electrons as spatially localized wave--packets. The simple and\nconvenient expressions are derived for a number of scattering events in\ncollision of such a vortex electron with a single potential, located at a given\nimpact parameter with respect to the wave-packet's axis. The more realistic\nscenarios are also considered with either localized (mesoscopic) targets or\ninfinitely wide (macroscopic) ones that consist of the randomly distributed\natoms. Dependence of the electron scattering pattern on a size and on a\nrelative position of the target is studied in detail for all three scenarios of\nthe single--potential--, mesoscopic-- and the macroscopic targets made of\nhydrogen in the ground $1s$ state. The results demonstrate that the angular\ndistribution of the outgoing electrons can be very sensitive to the OAM and to\nkinematic parameters of the focused twisted beams, as well as to composition of\nthe target. Scattering of vortex electrons by atoms can, therefore, serve as a\nvaluable tool for diagnostic of such beams.\n", "  The performance of a ring of linearly coupled, monostable nonlinear\noscillators is optimized towards its goal of acting as energy\nharvester---through piezoelectric transduction---of mesoscopic fluctuations,\nwhich are modeled as Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noises. For a single oscillator, the\nmaximum output voltage and overall efficiency are attained for a soft\npiecewise-linear potential (providing a weak attractive constant force) but\nthey are still fairly large for a harmonic potential. When several harmonic\nsprings are linearly and bidirectionally coupled to form a ring, it is found\nthat counter-phase coupling can largely improve the performance while in-phase\ncoupling worsens it. Moreover, it turns out that few (two or three) coupled\nunits perform better than more.\n", "  Glass-to-glass and liquid-to-liquid phase transitions were observed many\nyears ago in bulk and confined water with or without applied pressure. It is\nshown that they result from the competition of two-liquid phases separated by\nan enthalpy difference depending on temperature. The model is based on the\nclassical nucleation equation of these phases completed by this enthalpy saving\nexisting at all temperatures and a pressure contribution. The thermodynamic\nparameters of amorphous water, the multiple glass transition temperatures, the\nenthalpy changes, and the temperature of maximum density under negative\npressure above Tg =227.5K are predicted to be in agreement with many\nmeasurements\n", "  We consider tunneling from the spin-polarized tip into the Luttinger liquid\nedge state of quantum spin Hall system. This problem arose in context of the\nspin and charge fractionalization of an injected electron. Renormalization of\nthe dc conductances of the system is calculated in the fermionic approach and\nscattering states formalism. In lowest order of tunneling amplitude we confirm\nprevious results for the scaling dependence of conductances. Going beyond the\nlowest order we show that interaction affects not only the total tunneling\nrate, but also the asymmetry of the injected current. The helical edge state\nforbids the backscattering, which leads to the possibility of two stable fixed\npoints in renormalization group sense, in contrast to the Y-junction between\nthe usual quantum wires.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of a two-level quantum system (TLS) under the\ninfluence of a strong sinusoidal driving signal whose origin is the interaction\nof the two-level system with a quantum field. In this approach the driving\nfield is replaced by a harmonic oscillator that is either strongly coupled to\nthe TLS or populated with a large number of photons. Starting from the Rabi\nmodel, we derive expressions for the TLS's oscillation frequencies and compare\nthe results with those obtained from the model where the driving signal is\ntreated classically. We show that in the limits of weak coupling and large\nphoton number, the well-known expression for the Rabi frequency in the strong\ndriving regime is recovered. In the opposite limit of strong coupling and small\nphoton number, we find differences between the predictions of the semiclassical\nand quantum models. The results of the quantum picture can therefore be\nunderstood as Landau-Zener-Stueckelberg interferometry in the fully quantum\nregime.\n", "  The pair-production process in the presence of strong linearly polarized\nlaser fields with a subcycle structure is considered. Laser pulses with\ndifferent envelope shapes are examined by means of a nonperturbative numerical\ntechnique. We analyze two different \"flat\" envelope shapes and two shapes\nwithout a plateau for their various parameters including the carrier-envelope\nphase. The resonant Rabi oscillations, momentum distribution of particles\ncreated, and total number of pairs are studied. It is demonstrated that all\nthese characteristics are very sensitive to the pulse shape.\n", "  Light-matter interaction at the nanoscale in magnetic materials is a topic of\nintense research in view of potential applications in next-generation\nhigh-density magnetic recording. Laser-assisted switching provides a pathway\nfor overcoming the material constraints of high-anisotropy and high-packing\ndensity media, though much about the dynamics of the switching process remains\nunexplored. We use ultrafast small-angle x-ray scattering at an x-ray\nfree-electron laser to probe the magnetic switching dynamics of FePt\nnanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix following excitation by an optical\nfemtosecond laser pulse. We observe that the combination of laser excitation\nand applied static magnetic field, one order of magnitude smaller than the\ncoercive field, can overcome the magnetic anisotropy barrier between \"up\" and\n\"down\" magnetization, enabling magnetization switching. This magnetic switching\nis found to be inhomogeneous throughout the material, with some individual FePt\nnanoparticles neither switching nor demagnetizing. The origin of this behavior\nis identified as the near-field modification of the incident laser radiation\naround FePt nanoparticles. The fraction of not-switching nanoparticles is\ninfluenced by the heat flow between FePt and a heat-sink layer.\n", "  The magnetically charged SU(2) Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black-hole solutions of\nthe coupled nonlinear Einstein-Yang-Mills field equations are known to be\ncharacterized by infinite spectra of unstable (imaginary) resonances\n$\\{\\omega_n(r_+,r_-)\\}_{n=0}^{n=\\infty}$ (here $r_{\\pm}$ are the black-hole\nhorizon radii). Based on direct {\\it numerical} computations of the black-hole\ninstability spectra, it has recently been observed that the excited instability\neigenvalues of the magnetically charged black holes exhibit a simple universal\nbehavior. In particular, it was shown that the numerically computed instability\neigenvalues of the magnetically charged black holes are characterized by the\nsmall frequency universal relation $\\omega_n(r_+-r_-)=\\lambda_n$, where\n$\\{\\lambda_n\\}$ are dimensionless constants which are independent of the\nblack-hole parameters. In the present paper we study analytically the\ninstability spectra of the magnetically charged SU(2) Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack holes. In particular, we provide a rigorous {\\it analytical} proof for\nthe {\\it numerically}-suggested universal behavior\n$\\omega_n(r_+-r_-)=\\lambda_n$ in the small frequency $\\omega_n r_+\\ll\n(r_+-r_-)/r_+$ regime. Interestingly, it is shown that the excited black-hole\nresonances are characterized by the simple universal relation\n$\\omega_{n+1}/\\omega_n=e^{-2\\pi/\\sqrt{3}}$. Finally, we confirm our analytical\nresults for the black-hole instability spectra with numerical computations.\n", "  We study the thermal transport in two-dimensional systems with a nontrivial\nBerry curvature texture. The physical realizations are many: for a sake of\ndefiniteness we consider undoped graphene gapped by the presence of an aligned\nhexagonal-Boron-Nitride substrate. The same phenomenology applies, i.e., to\nsurface states of 3D topological insulators in the presence of a uniform\nmagnetization. We find that chiral valley-polarized second-sound collective\nmodes propagate along the edges of the system. The localization length of the\nedge modes has topological origin stemming from the anomalous velocity term in\nthe quasiparticle current. At low temperature, the single-particle contribution\nto the transverse thermal conductance is exponentially suppressed and only\nsecond-sound modes carry heat along the boundary. A sharp change in the\nbehavior of the thermal Hall conductance, extracted from nonlocal measurements\nof the temperature along the edge, marks the onset of ballistic heat transport\ndue to second-sound edge modes.\n", "  First-principles calculations combining density-functional theory and\ncontinuum solvation models enable realistic theoretical modeling and design of\nelectrochemical systems. When a reaction proceeds in such systems, the number\nof electrons in the portion of the system treated quantum mechanically changes\ncontinuously, with a balancing charge appearing in the continuum electrolyte. A\ngrand-canonical ensemble of electrons at a chemical potential set by the\nelectrode potential is therefore the ideal description of such systems that\ndirectly mimics the experimental condition. We present two distinct algorithms,\na self-consistent field method (GC-SCF) and a direct variational free energy\nminimization method using auxiliary Hamiltonians (GC-AuxH), to solve the\nKohn-Sham equations of electronic density-functional theory directly in the\ngrand canonical ensemble at fixed potential. Both methods substantially improve\nperformance compared to a sequence of conventional fixed-number calculations\ntargeting the desired potential, with the GC-AuxH method additionally\nexhibiting reliable and smooth exponential convergence of the grand free\nenergy. Finally, we apply grand-canonical DFT to the under-potential deposition\nof copper on platinum from chloride-containing electrolytes and show that\nchloride desorption, not partial copper monolayer formation, is responsible for\nthe second voltammetric peak.\n", "  Mergers of galaxies are thought to cause significant gas inflows to the inner\nparsecs, which can activate rapid accretion onto supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs), giving rise to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). During a significant\nfraction of this process, SMBHs are predicted to be enshrouded by gas and dust.\nStudying 52 galactic nuclei in infrared-selected local Luminous and\nUltra-luminous infrared galaxies in different merger stages in the hard X-ray\nband, where radiation is less affected by absorption, we find that the amount\nof material around SMBHs increases during the last phases of the merger. We\nfind that the fraction of Compton-thick (CT, $N_{\\rm\\,H}\\geq\n10^{24}\\rm\\,cm^{-2}$) AGN in late merger galaxies is higher\n($f_{\\rm\\,CT}=65^{+12}_{-13}\\%$) than in local hard X-ray selected AGN\n($f_{\\rm\\,CT}=27\\pm 4\\%$), and that obscuration reaches its maximum when the\nnuclei of the two merging galaxies are at a projected distance of\n$D_{12}\\simeq0.4-10.8$ kiloparsecs ($f_{\\rm\\,CT}=77_{-17}^{+13}\\%$). We also\nfind that all AGN of our sample in late merger galaxies have $N_{\\rm\\,H}>\n10^{23}\\rm\\,cm^{-2}$, which implies that the obscuring material covers\n$95^{+4}_{-8}\\%$ of the X-ray source. These observations show that the material\nis most effectively funnelled from the galactic scale to the inner tens of\nparsecs during the late stages of galaxy mergers, and that the close\nenvironment of SMBHs in advanced mergers is richer in gas and dust with respect\nto that of SMBHs in isolated galaxies, and cannot be explained by the classical\nAGN unification model in which the torus is responsible for the obscuration.\n", "  K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ exhibits an iron-vacancy ordering at $T_{\\rm s}\n{\\sim}270{\\deg}$C and separates into two phases: a minor superconducting\n(iron-vacancy-disordered) phase and a major non-superconducting\n(iron-vacancy-ordered) phase. The microstructural and superconducting\nproperties of this intermixture can be tuned by an appropriate control of the\nquenching process through $T_{\\rm s}$. A faster quenching rate leads to a finer\nmicrostructure and a suppression of formation of the non-superconducting phase\nby up to 50%. Nevertheless, such a faster cooling rate does induce a monotonic\nreduction in the superconducting transition temperature (from 30.7 K down to\n26.0 K) and, simultaneously, a decrease in the iron content within the\nsuperconducting phase such that the compositional ratio changed from\nK$_{0.35}$Fe$_{1.83}$Se$_2$ to K$_{0.58}$Fe$_{1.71}$Se$_2$.\n", "  We study a consistent deformation of the cubic open bosonic string theory in\nsuch a way that the non-planar world sheet diagrams of the perturbative string\ntheory are mapped onto their equivalent planar diagrams of the light-cone\nstring field theory with some length parameters fixed. An explicit evaluation\nof the cubic string vertex in the zero-slope limit yields the correct\nrelationship between the string coupling constant and the Yang-Mills coupling\nconstant. The deformed cubic open string field theory is shown to produce the\nnon-Abelian Yang-Mills action in the zero-slope limit if it is defined on\nmultiple D-branes. Applying the consistent deformation systematically to\nmulti-string world sheet diagrams, we may be able to calculate scattering\namplitudes with an arbitrary number of external open strings.\n", "  In this letter, we report growth and characterization of bulk Bi2Se3 single\ncrystals. The studied Bi2Se3 crystals are grown by self flux method through\nsolid state reaction from high temperature (950C) melt of constituent elements\nand slow cooling (2C/hour). The resultant crystals are shiny and grown in [00l]\ndirection, as evidenced from surface XRD. Detailed Reitveld analysis of PXRD\n(powder x-ray diffraction) of the crystals showed that these are crystallized\nin rhombohedral crystal structure with space group of R3m (D5) and the lattice\nparameters are a = 4.14(2)A, b = 4.14 (2) A and c = 28.7010(7) A. Temperature\nversus resistivity (R-T) plots revealed metallic conduction down to 2K, with\ntypical room temperature resistivity (R300K) of around 0.53 mohm-cm and\nresidual resistivity of 0.12 mohm-cm. Resistivity under magnetic field ]\nmeasurements exhibited large +Ve magneto resistance right from 2K to 200K.\nIsothermal magneto resistance [RH] measurements at 2K, 100K and 200K exhibited\nmagneto resistance (MR) of up to 240, 130 and 60 percent respectively at 14\nTesla. Further the MR plots are non saturating and linear with field at all\ntemperature. At 2K the MR plots showed clear quantum oscillations at above say\n10 Tesla applied field. Also the Kohler plots i.e., were seen consolidating on\none plot. Interestingly, the studied Bi2Se3 single crystal exhibited the\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdH) at 2K under different applied magnetic\nfields ranging from 4Tesla to 14 Tesla\n", "  Since the dramatic interface enhancement of superconducting transition\ntemperature (Tc) was reported in one unit-cell FeSe film grown on SrTiO3\nsubstrate (1-UC FeSe/STO) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), related research on\nthis system has become a new frontier in condensed matter physics. In this\npaper, we present a brief review on this rapidly developing field, mainly\nfocusing on the superconducting properties of 1-UC FeSe/STO. Experimental\nevidences for the high-temperature superconductivity in 1-UC FeSe/STO,\nincluding the direct evidences revealed by transport and diamagnetic\nmeasurements, and other evidences from scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), are overviewed. Potential\nmechanisms of the enhanced superconductivity are discussed. There are\naccumulating arguments suggesting that the strengthened Cooper pairing in 1-UC\nFeSe/STO originates from the interface effects, specifically charge transfer\nand coupling to phonon modes in TiO2 plane. The study of superconductivity in\n1-UC FeSe/STO not only sheds a new light on the mechanism of high-temperature\nsuperconductors with layered structures, but also provides the insight to\nexplore new superconductors by interface engineering.\n", "  We investigate the influences of the nuclear composition on the weak\ninteraction rates of heavy nuclei during the core collapse of massive stars.\nThe nuclear abundances in nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) are calculated\nby some equation of state (EOS) models including in-medium effects on nuclear\nmasses. We systematically examine the sensitivities of electron capture and\nneutrino-nucleus scattering on heavy nuclei to the nuclear shell effects and\nthe single nucleus approximation. We find that the washout of shell effects at\nhigh temperatures brings significant change to weak rates by smoothing the\nnuclear abundance distribution: the electron capture rate decreases by\n$\\sim$20$\\%$ in the early phase and increases by $\\sim$40$\\%$ in the late phase\nat most, while the cross section for neutrino-nucleus scattering is reduced by\n$\\sim$15$\\%$. This is because the open-shell nuclei become abundant instead of\nthose with closed neutron shells as the shell effects disappear. We also find\nthat the single-nucleus description based on the average values leads to\nunderestimations of weak rates. Electron captures and neutrino coherent\nscattering on heavy nuclei are reduced by $\\sim$80$\\%$ in the early phase and\nby $\\sim$5$\\%$ in the late phase, respectively. These results indicate that NSE\nlike EOS accounting for shell washout is indispensable for the reliable\nestimation of weak interaction rates in simulations of core-collapse\nsupernovae.\n", "  To obtain the precise values of the bulk quantities and transport\ncoefficients in quark-gluon-plasma phase, we propose that a direct calculation\nof the renormalized energy-momentum tensor (EMT) on the lattice using the\ngradient flow. From one-point function of EMT, authors in Ref.[1] obtained the\ninteraction measure and thermal entropy. The results are consistent with the\none obtained by the integral method. Based on the success, we try to measure\nthe two-point function of EMT, which is related to the transport coefficients.\nAdvantages of our method are (1) a clear signal because of the smearing effects\nof the gradient flow and (2) no need to calculate the wave function\nrenormalization of EMT. In addition, we give a short remark on a comparison of\nthe numerical cost between the positive- and adjoint-flow methods for fermions,\nneeded to obtain the EMT in the (2+1) flavor QCD.\n", "  We investigate the optical transition selection rules for excitonic Rydberg\nseries formed in massive Dirac cones. The entanglement of the exciton envelop\nfunction with the pseudospin texture leads to anomalous selection rules for\none-photon generation of excitons, where $d$-orbitals can be excited with the\nopposite helicity selection rule from the $s$-orbitals in a given valley. The\ntrigonal warping effects in realistic hexagonal lattices further renders more\nexcited states bright, where $p$-orbitals can also be accessed by one-photon\nexcitation with the opposite valley selection rules to the $s$-orbitals. The\none-photon generation of exciton in the various states and the intra-excitonic\ntransition between these states are both dictated by the discrete in-plane\nrotational symmetry of the lattices, and our results show that in hexagonal 2D\nmaterials the symmetry allowed transitions are enabled when trigonal warping\neffects are included in the massive Dirac fermion model. In monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides where excitons can be generated by visible\nlight and intra-excitonic transitions can be induced by infrared light, we give\nthe strength of these optical transitions, estimated using modified\nhydrogen-like envelope functions combined with the optical transition matrix\nelements between the Bloch states calculated at various $k$ points.\n", "  The hot carrier dynamics and its effect on the device performance of GaAs\nsolar cell and InAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cell (QDSC) was investigated. At\nfirst, the fundamental operation feature of conventional hot carrier solar cell\nwas simulated based on the detailed balance thermodynamic model. Then we\ninvestigated the hot carrier dynamics in the normal junction based solar cell\nusing hydrodynamic/energy Boltzmann transportation model (HETM) where the two\ntemperature (carrier temperature and lattice temperature are treated\nseparately. For the first time, we report an inherent quasi-equivalence between\nthe detailed balance model and HETM model. The inter-link revealed here\naddresses the energy conservation law used in the detailed balance model from\ndifferent angle and it paves a way toward an alternative approach to curtail\nthe selective contact constraints used in the conventional hot carrier solar\ncell. In simulation, a specially designed InAs/GaAs quantum dot solar cell was\nused in the simulation. By varying the hot carrier energy relaxation time , an\nincrease in the open circuit voltage was clearly found with the increase of .\nDetailed analysis was presented regarding the spatial distribution of hot\ncarrier temperature and its interplay with electric field and three hot carrier\nrecombination processes (Auger, SRH and radiative)\n", "  We present an infinite class of one-parameter scalar field extensions to the\nBTZ black hole in 2+1-dimensions. By virtue of the scalar charge the thin-shell\nwormhole supported by a linear fluid at the throat becomes stable against\nlinear perturbations. More interestingly, we provide an example of thin-shell\nwormhole which is strictly stable in the sense that it is confined in between\ntwo classically intransmissible potential barriers.\n", "  We perform numerical hydrodynamical simulations in order to calculate the\nluminosity and the spectrum of the BL and its dependence on parameters like the\nmass, rotation rate or mass accretion rate of the central white dwarf (WD).\nTherefore, we treat the problem in the one-dimensional, radial slim disk\napproximation. We employ a classical $\\alpha$-viscosity to account for the\nturbulence and include cooling from the disk surfaces as well as radial\nradiation transport. To account for the high temperatures in BLs around WDs, we\nalso consider the radiation energy in a one-temperature approximation. We find\nthat 1D models of the BL are well suited if one is interested in the radiation\ncharacteristics of the BL. The BL luminosity directly depends on the varied\nparameters which makes it possible to draw conclusions about real systems by\ncomparing observations with our synthetic models. Ambiguities concerning\ndifferent models with identical luminosities can be mitigated by regarding the\nemitted spectrum. We therefore present a method to gain information about a\nsystem by probing the radiation of the BL.\n", "  Strontium doping transforms manganites of type La(1-x)Sr(x)MnO(3) from an\ninsulating antiferromagnet (x=0) to a metallic ferromagnet (x>0.16) due to the\ninduced charge carriers (holes). Neutron scattering experiments were employed\nto investigate the effect of Sr doping on a tailor-made compound of composition\nLa(0.7)Sr(0.3)Mn(0.1)Ti(0.3)Ga(0.6)O(3). By the simultaneous doping with Sr2+\nand Ti4+ ions the compound remains in the insulating state, so that the\nmagnetic interactions for large Sr doping can be studied in the absence of\ncharge carriers. At TC=215 K there is a first-order reconstructive phase\ntransition from the trigonal R-3c structure to the orthorhombic Pnma structure\nvia an intermediate virtual configuration described by the common monoclinic\nsubgroup P21/c. The magnetic excitations associated with Mn3+ dimers give\nevidence for two different nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange\ninteractions, in contrast to the undoped compound LaMnyA(1-y)O(3) where both\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are present. The doping\ninduced changes of the exchange coupling originates from different Mn-O-Mn bond\nangles determined by neutron diffraction. The large fourth-nearest-neighbor\ninteraction found for metallic manganites is absent in the insulating state. We\nargue that the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction reasonably accounts\nfor all the exchange couplings derived from the spin-wave dispersion in\nmetallic manganites.\n", "  Contrary to microbial taxis, where a tactic response to external stimuli is\ncontrolled by complex chemical pathways acting like sensor-actuator loops,\ntaxis of artificial microswimmers is a purely stochastic effect associated with\na non-uniform activation of the particles' self-propulsion. We study the tactic\nresponse of such swimmers in a spatio-temporally modulated activating medium by\nmeans of both numerical and analytical techniques. In the opposite limits of\nvery fast and very slow rotational particle dynamics, we obtain analytic\napproximations that closely reproduce the numerical description. A swimmer\ndrifts on average either parallel or anti-parallel to the propagation direction\nof the activating pulses, depending on their speed and width. The drift in line\nwith the pulses is solely determined by the finite persistence length of the\nactive Brownian motion performed by the swimmer, whereas the drift in the\nopposite direction results from the combination of ballistic and diffusive\nproperties of the swimmer's dynamics.\n", "  A new paradigm is required to facilitate the demand for the huge data storage\ncapacity and faster data processing in the future. Nano structures such as\nmagnetic skyrmions have been predicted to address this issues as these vortex\nstructures are the smallest particle-like magnetic features and are\ntopologically protected from crystallographic defects or magnetic disorder. We\nreport here stable skyrmions at room temperature and with zero applied field in\nebeam evaporated Ir Fe Ir MgO thin film stacks. Micromagnetic simulations show\nthat these skyrmions are induced by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya\ninteractions between the ferromagnetic and heavy metal ultra thin layers values\nin the range between 3.1 to 3.6. We also show the field dependencies of the\nskyrmion width and density. The room temperature zero field width is 110 nm,\napproximately comparable to the value showed by Fert et al and Boulle et al for\nthe multi stacks thin film. DFT calculations corroborate our experimental\nresults by predicting a DMI value of 3.67.\n", "  Helium-ion beams (HIB) focused to sub-nanometer scales have emerged as\npowerful tools for high-resolution imaging as well as nano-scale lithography,\nion milling or deposition. Quantifying irradiation effects is essential for\nreliable device fabrication but most of the depth profiling information is\nprovided by computer simulations rather than experiment. Here, we use atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM) combined with scanning near-field optical microscopy\n(SNOM) to provide three-dimensional (3D) dielectric characterization of\nhigh-temperature superconductor devices fabricated by HIB. By imaging the\ninfrared dielectric response we find that amorphization caused by the nominally\n0.5 nm HIB extends throughout the entire 26.5 nm thickness of the cuprate film\nand by about 500 nm laterally. This unexpectedly widespread structural and\nelectronic damage can be attributed to a Helium depth distribution\nsubstantially modified by internal device interfaces. Our study introduces\nAFM-SNOM as a quantitative nano-scale tomographic technique for non-invasive 3D\ncharacterization of irradiation damage in a wide variety of devices.\n", "  We present the first gas-grain astrochemical model of the NGC 2264 CMM3\nprotostellar core. The chemical evolution of the core is affected by changing\nits physical parameters such as the total density and the amount of\ngas-depletion onto grain surfaces as well as the cosmic ray ionisation rate,\n$\\zeta$. We estimated $\\zeta_{\\text {CMM3}}$ = 1.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$\ns$^{-1}$. This value is 1.3 times higher than the standard CR ionisation rate,\n$\\zeta_{\\text {ISM}}$ = 1.3 $\\times$ 10$^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$. Species response\ndifferently to changes into the core physical conditions, but they are more\nsensitive to changes in the depletion percentage and CR ionisation rate than to\nvariations in the core density. Gas-phase models highlighted the importance of\nsurface reactions as factories of large molecules and showed that for sulphur\nbearing species depletion is important to reproduce observations.\n  Comparing the results of the reference model with the most recent millimeter\nobservations of the NGC 2264 CMM3 core showed that our model is capable of\nreproducing the observed abundances of most of the species during early stages\n($\\le$ 3$\\times$10$^4$ yrs) of their chemical evolution. Models with variations\nin the core density between 1 - 20 $\\times$ 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ are also in good\nagreement with observations during the early time interval 1 $\\times$ 10$^4 <$\nt (yr) $<$ 5 $\\times$ 10$^4$. In addition, models with higher CR ionisation\nrates (5 - 10) $\\times \\zeta_{\\text {ISM}}$ are often overestimating the\nfractional abundances of the species. However, models with $\\zeta_{\\text\n{CMM3}}$ = 5 $\\zeta_{\\text {ISM}}$ may best fit observations at times $\\sim$ 2\n$\\times$ 10$^4$ yrs. Our results suggest that CMM3 is (1 - 5) $\\times$ 10$^4$\nyrs old. Therefore, the core is chemically young and it may host a Class 0\nobject as suggested by previous studies.\n", "  We address the issue of improving the quality of the joint remote preparation\nof an arbitrary two-qubit in case four qubits of the quantum channel which\nconsists of a GHZ state and a GHZ-like one are subjected to noises. Two\ncontrolling parameters are added, one in the quantum channel and other in the\nmeasurement of the second sender, in order to optimize the averaged fidelities.\nThe results from analyzing the behaviors of the optimal averaged fidelities\nshow that there are essentially two different ways for the optimization of the\nefficiency of the protocol. The first is simply choosing suitably the quantum\nchannel as well as the measurement in which the desired fidelity can be found\nin large values of noisy parameters. The second is by means of interactions\nbetween qubits and dissipative environments whose result is more noises more\nfidelity.\n", "  We demonstrate light-induced localization of Coulomb-interacting particles in\nmulti-dimensional structures. Subwavelength localization of ions within small\nmulti-dimensional Coulomb crystals by an intracavity optical standing wave\nfield is evidenced by measuring the difference in scattering inside\nsymmetrically red- and blue-detuned optical lattices and is observed even for\nions undergoing substantial radial micromotion. These results are promising\nsteps towards the structural control of ion Coulomb crystals by optical fields\nas well as for complex many-body simulations with ion crystals or for the\ninvestigation of heat transfer at the nanoscale, and have potential\napplications for ion-based cavity quantum electrodynamics, cavity optomechanics\nand ultracold ion chemistry.\n", "  We determine spectral indices of 228 pulsars by using Parkes pulsar data\nobserved at 1.4 GHz, among which 200 spectra are newly determined. The indices\nare distributed in the range from -4.84 to -0.46.Together with known pulsar\nspectra from literature, we tried to find clues to the pulsar emission process.\nThe weak correlations between the spectral index, the spin-down energy loss\nrate $\\dot{E}$ and the potential drop in the polar gap $\\Delta\\Psi$ hint that\nemission properties are related to the particle acceleration process in a\npulsar's magnetosphere.\n", "  The paper is devoted to recent advances in stochastic modeling of anomalous\nkinetic processes observed in dielectric materials which are prominent examples\nof disordered (complex) systems. Theoretical studies of dynamical properties of\nthose \"structures with variations\" [Goldenfield and Kadanoff 1999 Science 284\n87--9] require application of such mathematical tools by means of which their\nrandom nature can be analyzed and, independently of the details differing\nvarious systems (dipolar materials, glasses, semiconductors, liquid crystals,\npolymers, etc.), the empirical universal kinetic patterns can be derived. We\nbegin with a brief survey of the historical background of the dielectric\nrelaxation study. After a short outline of the theoretical ideas providing the\nrandom tools applicable to modeling of relaxation phenomena, we present\nprobabilistic implications for the study of the relaxation-rate distribution\nmodels. In the framework of the probability distribution of relaxation rates we\nconsider description of complex systems, in which relaxing entities form random\nclusters interacting with each other and single entities. Then we focus on\nstochastic mechanisms of the relaxation phenomenon. We discuss the diffusion\napproach and its usefulness for understanding of anomalous dynamics of the\nrelaxing systems. We also discuss extensions of the diffusive approach to the\nsystems under tempered random processes. Useful relationships among different\nstochastic approaches to the anomalous dynamics of complex systems allow us to\nget a fresh look on this subject. The paper closes with a final discussion on\nachievements of stochastic tools describing the anomalous time evolution of the\ncomplex systems.\n", "  Since de Broglie's pilot wave theory was revived by David Bohm in the 1950's,\nthe overwhelming majority of researchers involved in the field have focused on\nwhat is nowadays called de Broglie-Bohm dynamics and de Broglie's original\ndouble solution program was gradually forgotten. As a result, several of the\nkey concepts in the theory are still rather vague and ill-understood. In the\nlight of the progress achieved over the course of the 90 years that have passed\nsince de Broglie's presentation of his ideas at the Solvay conference of 1927,\nwe reconsider in the present paper the status of the double solution program.\nMore than a somewhat dusty archaeological piece of history of science, we\nbelieve it should be considered as a legitimate attempt to reconcile quantum\ntheory with realism.\n", "  A long-term energy option that is just approaching the horizon after decades\nof struggle, is fusion. Recent developments allow us to apply techniques from\nspin physics to advance its viability. The cross section for the primary fusion\nfuel in a tokamak reactor, D+T=>alpha+n, would be increased by a factor of 1.5\nif the fuels were polarized. Simulations predict further non-linear power gains\nin large-scale machines such as ITER, due to increased alpha heating. These are\nsignificant enhancements that could lower the requirements needed to reach\nignition and could be used to extend useful reactor life by compensating for\nneutron degradation. The potential realization rests on the survival of spin\npolarization for periods comparable to the energy containment time. Interest in\npolarized fuel options had an initial peak of activity in the 1980s, where\ncalculations predicted that polarizations could in fact survive a plasma.\nHowever, concerns were raised regarding the cumulative impacts of fuel\nrecycling from the reactor walls. In addition, the technical challenges of\npreparing and handling polarized materials prevented direct tests. Over the\nlast several decades, this situation has changed dramatically. Detailed\nsimulations of the ITER plasma have projected negligible wall recycling in a\nhigh power reactor. In addition, a combination of advances in three areas -\npolarized material technologies, polymer pellets developed for Inertial\nConfinement, and cryogenic injection guns developed for delivering fuel into\nthe core of tokamaks - have matured to the point where a direct it in situ\nmeasurement is possible. A Jefferson Lab - DIII-D/General Atomics - University\nof Virginia collaboration is developing designs for a proof-of-principle\npolarization survival experiment using the isospin mirror reaction,\nD+3He=>alpha+p, at the DIII-D tokamak in San Diego.\n", "  q-Gaussian distribution appear in many science areas where we can find\nsystems that could be described within a nonextensive framework. Usually, a way\nto assert that these systems belongs to nonextensive framework is by means of\nnumerical data analysis. To this end, we implement random number generator for\nq-Gaussian distribution, while we present how to computing its probability\ndensity function, cumulative density function and quantile function besides a\ntail weight measurement using robust statistics.\n", "  In this paper we classify the irreducible quasifinite highest weight modules\nover the orthogonal and symplectic types Lie subalgebras of the Lie algebra of\nthe matrix quantum pseudo differential operators. We also realize them in terms\nof the irreducible quasifinite highest weight modules of the Lie algebras of\ninfinite matrices with finitely many nonzero diagonals and its classical Lie\nsubalgebras of types B, C and D.\n", "  The common assumption that Theta-1-Ori C is the dominant ionizing source for\nthe Orion Nebula is critically examined. This assumption underlies much of the\nexisting analysis of the nebula. In this paper we establish through comparison\nof the relative strengths of emission lines with expectations from Cloudy\nmodels and through the direction of the bright edges of proplyds that\nTheta-2-Ori-A, which lies beyond the Bright Bar, also plays an important role.\nTheta-1-Ori-C does dominate ionization in the inner part of the Orion Nebula,\nbut outside of the Bright Bar as far as the southeast boundary of the Extended\nOrion Nebula, Theta-2-Ori-A is the dominant source. In addition to identifying\nthe ionizing star in sample regions, we were able to locate those portions of\nthe nebula in 3-D. This analysis illustrates the power of MUSE spectral imaging\nobservations in identifying sources of ionization in extended regions.\n", "  Normally, understanding the temperature dependent transport properties of\nstrongly correlated electron systems remains challenging task due to complex\nelectronic structure and its variations (around E$_{F}$) with temperature.\nHere, we report the applicability of DFT+U in explaining thermopower ($\\alpha$)\nand electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$) in high temperature region. We have\nmeasured temperature dependent $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ in the 300-600 K range.\nThe non-monotonic temperature dependent behavior of $\\alpha$ and metallic\nbehavior of $\\sigma$ were observed. The value of $\\alpha$ at 300 K was\n$\\sim$15.80 $\\mu$V/K and it decreases upto $\\sim$477 K ($\\sim$11.6 $\\mu$V/K)\nand it further increases with temperature to the $\\sim$14.8 $\\mu$V/K at 600 K,\nwhereas the values of $\\sigma$ were found to be $\\sim$1.42 $\\times$10$^{5}$\n$\\Omega$$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ and $\\sim$0.20 $\\times$10$^{5}$ $\\Omega$$^{-1}$\nm$^{-1}$ at 300 and 600 K, respectively. Combining the WIEN2k and BoltzTraP\ncode, the electronic structure and temperature dependent transport coefficients\nwere calculated. The ferromagnetic ground state electronic structure with\nhalf-metallic character obtained from the DFT+U calculations, U = 3.1 eV,\nprovides better explanation of high-temperature transport behavior. Two current\nmodel was used for calculation of $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ where the temperature\ndependent values of relaxation time ($\\tau$), almost linear for up-spin,\n$\\tau$$_{up}$, and non-linear for dn-spin, $\\tau$$_{dn}$, were used and\nestimated values were found to be in good agreement with experimentally\nreported values.\n", "  We report the realisation of a cyclotron trap assisted positron tungsten\nmoderator for the conversion of positrons with a broad keV- few MeV energy\nspectrum to a mono-energetic eV beam with an efficiency of 1.8(2)% defined as\nthe ratio of the slow positrons divided by the $\\beta^+$ activity of the\nradioactive source. This is an improvement of almost two orders of magnitude\ncompared to the state of the art of tungsten moderators. The simulation\nvalidated with this measurement suggests that using an optimised setup even\nhigher efficiencies are achievable.\n", "  Gate model quantum computers with too many qubits to be simulated by\navailable classical computers are about to arrive. We present a strategy for\nprogramming these devices without error correction or compilation. This means\nthat the number of logical qubits is the same as the number of qubits on the\ndevice. The hardware determines which pairs of qubits can be addressed by\nunitary operators. The goal is to build quantum states that solve computational\nproblems such as maximizing a combinatorial objective function or minimizing a\nHamiltonian. These problems may not fit naturally on the physical layout of the\nqubits. Our algorithms use a sequence of parameterized unitaries that sit on\nthe qubit layout to produce quantum states depending on those parameters.\nMeasurements of the objective function (or Hamiltonian) guide the choice of new\nparameters with the goal of moving the objective function up (or lowering the\nenergy). As an example we consider finding approximate solutions to MaxCut on\n3-regular graphs whereas the hardware is physical qubits laid out on a\nrectangular grid. We prove that the lowest depth version of the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm will achieve an approximation ratio of at\nleast 0.5293 on all large enough instances which beats random guessing (0.5).\nWe open up the algorithm to have different parameters for each single qubit $X$\nrotation and for each $ZZ$ interaction associated with the nearest neighbor\ninteractions on the grid. Small numerical experiments indicate that an\nenveloping classical algorithm can be used to find the parameters which sit on\nthe grid to optimize an objective function with a different connectivity. We\ndiscuss strategies for finding good parameters but offer no evidence yet that\nthe proposed approach can beat the best classical algorithms. Ultimately the\nstrength of this approach will be determined by running on actual hardware.\n", "  Identifying and understanding student difficulties with physics content in a\nwide variety of topical areas is an active research area within the PER\ncommunity. In many cases, physics topics appear multiple times in different\ncontexts across the undergraduate physics curriculum. As these common topics\nreappear, student difficulties can perpetuate from one context to the next, or\nnew difficulties can emerge as students encounter new physical contexts. One\nexample of such a topic is boundary conditions. It is broadly considered to be\nan important topic that advanced physics undergraduates are expected to\nunderstand and apply in multiple topical areas including classical mechanics,\nquantum mechanics, and throughout electricity and magnetism (EM). We report\nfindings from an investigation of student difficulties using boundary\nconditions focusing on the context of electrodynamics. Our data sources include\nstudent responses to traditional exam questions, conceptual survey questions,\nand think aloud interviews. The analysis was guided by an analytical framework\nthat characterizes how students activate, construct, execute, and reflect on\nboundary conditions. Common observed student difficulties include: activating\nboundary conditions in appropriate contexts; constructing a complex expression\nfor the E&M waves; mathematically simplifying and manipulating complex\nexponential and, checking if the reflection and transmission coefficient are\nphysical. We also present potential pedagogical implications based on our\nobservations.\n", "  The apparent dichotomy between quantum jumps on the one hand, and continuous\ntime evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a\nchallenge to Bohr's proposal of quantum jumps in atoms. Furthermore,\nSchroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of\nthe explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility\nof superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed,\nSchroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of\ndiscrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different\nenergies.\n  However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave\nmechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full\nimplementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix\nformalism reconciles quantum jumps with continuous time evolution through the\nidentification of quantum jumps with transitions between different sectors of\nFock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a\nsum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock\nspace.\n  In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering\nmatrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from the\nresolution of the dichotomy between quantum jumps and continuous time evolution\ntherefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of\nquantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate\nthat discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take\ninto account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the\nrole of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of\nquantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually\nexpected.\n", "  In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, electron scattering off impurities\ndepends on both spin and orbital angular momentum of electrons -- spin-orbit\nscattering. Although some transport properties are subject to spin-orbit\nscattering, experimental techniques directly accessible to this effect are\nlimited. Here we show that a signature of spin-orbit scattering manifests\nitself in quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaged by spectroscopic-imaging\nscanning tunneling microscopy. The experimental data of a polar semiconductor\nBiTeI are well reproduced by numerical simulations with the $T$-matrix\nformalism that include not only scalar scattering normally adopted but also\nspin-orbit scattering stronger than scalar scattering. To accelerate the\nsimulations, we extend the standard efficient method of QPI calculation for\nmomentum-independent scattering to be applicable even for spin-orbit\nscattering. We further identify a selection rule that makes spin-orbit\nscattering visible in the QPI pattern. These results demonstrate that\nspin-orbit scattering can exert predominant influence on QPI patterns and thus\nsuggest that QPI measurement is available to detect spin-orbit scattering.\n", "  Machine learning has proven to be a valuable tool to approximate functions in\nhigh-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the\nrelevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large\ndataset in the first place. Here we present a description of atomic systems\nthat generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical\ninterpretation. As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal\ndescriptor of grain boundary systems. Grain boundaries in crystalline materials\nare a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad\nimpact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion\nresistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. In addition to modeling such\nproperties, the method also provides insight into the physical \"building\nblocks\" that influence them. This opens the way to discover the underlying\nphysics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to\nparticular properties. Once the structures are understood, they can then be\noptimized for desirable behaviors.\n", "  In the present paper an attempt has been made to study the spatially\nhomogeneous and isotropic FRW model and axially symmetric spacetime in f(R)\ntheory of gravity. We have obtained the solutions of the field equations in\nvacuum. To find the solutions of axially symmetric space-time we have assumed\nthe relation between scale factor and scalar field and also we considered that\nscalar expansion ({\\theta}) in the model is proportional to shear scalar\n({\\sigma}). The physical behavior for both models have been discussed by using\nphysical parameters. The function of Ricci scalar is investigated for these\nmodels. Key words: f(R) theory of gravity, FRW universe, Axially symmetric\nspace-time.\n", "  We have performed numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of two\nclosed active regions (AR). The input magnetic field values were the coronal\nmagnetic field computed as extrapolation coronal from observations of the\nphotospheric magnetic field. The studied active regions, NOAA AR12565 and\nAR12567, were registered as different bipolar region. Our investigation, the 3D\ncoronal extrapolations, as well as the numerical MHD experiments, revealed that\nactually they evolved together as a quadrupolar active region. The second\nregion emerged later under the loops system of AR12565 and separated from this\none. A natural current sheet formed between then and it plays an important role\nin the explosive events (flares and coronal mass ejections) occurrence.\n", "  We report microscopic calculation of key $\\beta$-decay properties for some of\nthe crucial waiting point species having neutron closed magic shells 50 and 82.\nOur calculation bear astrophysical significance vis-\\'{a}-vis speeding of the\n$r$-process. The $\\beta$-decay properties include half-lives, energy rates of\n$\\beta$-delayed neutrons and their emission probabilities, both under\nterrestrial and stellar conditions. We perform a pn-QRPA calculation with a\nseparable multi-shell interaction and include both allowed and unique\nfirst-forbidden (U1F) transitions in our calculation. We compare our results\nwith previous calculations and measured data. Our calculation is in good\nagreement with the experimental data. For certain cases, we noted a significant\ndecrease in the half-life calculation with the contribution of U1F transitions.\nThis is in contradiction to the shell model study where only for $N$ = 126\nwaiting-point nuclei, the forbidden transitions were reported to significantly\nreduce the calculated half-lives. Our model fulfills the Ikeda sum rule for\neven-even cases. For odd-A cases the rule is violated by up to 15$\\%$ for\n$^{125}$Tc.\n", "  This paper explains the periodicity of the Grover walk on finite graphs. We\ncharacterize the graphs to induce 2, 3, 4, 5-periodic Grover walk and obtain a\nnecessary condition of the graphs to induce an odd-periodic Grover walk.\n", "  There are three different methods used to search the neutrino mass: - The\nelectron antineutrino mass can probably best be determined by the Triton decay.\n- The neutrinoless Double Beta Decay yields information, if the neutrino is a\nDirac or a Majorana particle. It can also determine the Majorana neutrino mass.\n- Electron capture of an atomic bound electron by a proton in a nucleus bound\nelectron plus proton to neutron plus electron-neutrino can give the mass of the\nelectron neutrino. This contribution summarizes our theoretical work on the\npossibility to determine the electron neutrino mass by electron capture. One\nexpects the largest influence of the neutrino mass on this decay for a small Q\n= 2.8 keV for electron capture in Holmium. The energy of the Q value is\ndistributed to the emitted neutrino and the excitation of the Dy atom. Thus the\nenergy difference between the Q value and the upper end of the deexcitation\nspectrum is the electron neutrino mass. The excitation spectrum of Dy is\ncalculate by one-, two- and three-electron hole excitations, and by the\nshake-off process. The electron wave functions are calculated selfconsistently\nby the Dirac-Hartree-Fock approach for the bound and the continuum states. To\nextract the neutrino mass from the spectrum one must adjust simultaneously the\nneutrino mass, the Q value, the position, the relative strength and the width\nof the highest resonance. This fit is only possible, if the background is\nreduced relative to the present situation. In case of a drastically reduced\nbackground a fit of the Q-value and the neutrino mass only seems also to be\npossible. The analysis presented here shows, that the determination of the\nelectron neutrino mass by electron capture is difficult, but seems not to be\nimpossible.\n", "  I describe a relation (mostly conjectural) between the Seiberg-Witten\nmonopoles, Fueter sections, and G2 instantons. In the last part of this article\nI gathered some open questions connected with this relation.\n", "  The Extreme Energy Events Project is a synchronous sparse array of 52\ntracking detectors for studying High Energy Cosmic Rays (HECR) and Cosmic\nRays-related phenomena. The observatory is also meant to address Long Distance\nCorrelation (LDC) phenomena: the network is deployed over a broad area covering\n10 degrees in latitude and 11 in longitude. An overview of a set of preliminary\nresults is given, extending from the study of local muon flux dependance on\nsolar activity to the investigation of the upward-going component of muon flux\ntraversing the EEE stations; from the search for anisotropies at the sub-TeV\nscale to the hints for observations of km-scale Extensive Air Shower (EAS).\n", "  The friendship paradox states that in a social network, egos tend to have\nlower degree than their alters, or, \"your friends have more friends than you\ndo\". Most research has focused on the friendship paradox and its implications\nfor information transmission, but treating the network as static and\nunweighted. Yet, people can dedicate only a finite fraction of their attention\nbudget to each social interaction: a high-degree individual may have less time\nto dedicate to individual social links, forcing them to modulate the quantities\nof contact made to their different social ties. Here we study the friendship\nparadox in the context of differing contact volumes between egos and alters,\nfinding a connection between contact volume and the strength of the friendship\nparadox. The most frequently contacted alters exhibit a less pronounced\nfriendship paradox compared with the ego, whereas less-frequently contacted\nalters are more likely to be high degree and give rise to the paradox. We argue\ntherefore for a more nuanced version of the friendship paradox: \"your closest\nfriends have slightly more friends than you do\", and in certain networks even:\n\"your best friend has no more friends than you do\". We demonstrate that this\nrelationship is robust, holding in both a social media and a mobile phone\ndataset. These results have implications for information transfer and influence\nin social networks, which we explore using a simple dynamical model.\n", "  In this work we investigate theoretical and computational aspects of novel\nlattice fermion formulations for the simulation of lattice gauge theories. The\nlattice approach to quantum gauge theories is an important tool for studying\nquantum chromodynamics, where it is the only known framework for calculating\nphysical observables from first principles. In our investigations we focus on\nstaggered Wilson fermions and the related staggered domain wall and staggered\noverlap formulations. Originally proposed by Adams, these new fermion\ndiscretizations bear the potential to reduce the computational costs of\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations. Staggered Wilson fermions combine\naspects of both staggered and Wilson fermions while having a reduced number of\nfermion doublers compared to usual staggered fermions. Moreover, they can be\nused as a kernel operator for the domain wall fermion construction with\npotentially significantly improved chiral properties and for the overlap\noperator with its exact chiral symmetry. This allows the implementation of\nchirality on the lattice in a controlled manner at potentially significantly\nreduced costs. The practical potential and limitations of these new lattice\nfermions are also critically discussed.\n", "  Films of Cu-K-In-Se were co-evaporated at varied K/(K+Cu) compositions and\nsubstrate temperatures (with constant (K+Cu)/In ~ 0.85). Increased Na\ncomposition on the substrate's surface and decreased growth temperature were\nboth found to favor Cu1-xKxInSe2 (CKIS) alloy formation, relative to\nmixed-phase CuInSe2 + KInSe2 formation. Structures from X-ray diffraction\n(XRD), band gaps, resistivities, minority carrier lifetimes and carrier\nconcentrations from time-resolved photoluminescence were in agreement with\nprevious reports, where low K/(K+Cu) composition films exhibited properties\npromising for photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Films grown at 400-500 C were then\nannealed to 600 C under Se, which caused K loss by evaporation in proportion to\ninitial K/(K+Cu) composition. Similar to growth temperature, annealing drove\nCKIS alloy consumption and CuInSe2 + KInSe2 production, as evidenced by high\ntemperature XRD. Annealing also decomposed KInSe2 and formed K2In12Se19. At\nhigh temperature the KInSe2 crystal lattice gradually contracted as temperature\nand time increased, as well as just time. Evaporative loss of K during\nannealing could accompany the generation of vacancies on K lattice sites, and\nmay explain the KInSe2 lattice contraction. This knowledge of Cu-K-In-Se\nmaterial chemistry may be used to predict and control minor phase impurities in\nCu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 PV absorbers-where impurities below typical detection limits\nmay have played a role in recent world record PV efficiencies that utilized KF\npost-deposition treatments.\n", "  We optimized the substrate temperature (Ts) and phosphorus concentration (x)\nof BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 films on practical metal-tape substrates for pulsed laser\ndeposition from the viewpoints of crystallinity, superconductor critical\ntemperature (Tc), and critical current density (Jc). It was found that the\noptimum Ts and x values are 1050 degree C and x = 0.28, respectively. The\noptimized film exhibits Tc_onset = 26.6 and Tc_zero = 22.4 K along with a high\nself-field Jc at 4 K (~1 MA/cm2) and relatively isotropic Jc under magnetic\nfields up to 9 T. Unexpectedly, we found that lower crystallinity samples,\nwhich were grown at a higher Ts of 1250 degree C than the optimized Ts = 1050\ndegree C, exhibit higher Jc along the ab plane under high magnetic fields than\nthe optimized samples. The presence of horizontal defects that act as strong\nvortex pinning centers, such as stacking faults, are a possible origin of the\nhigh Jc values in the poor crystallinity samples.\n", "  The results obtained by studying the background of neutrons produced by\ncosmic-ray muons in underground experimental facilities intended for rare-event\nsearches and in surrounding rock are presented. The types of this rock may\ninclude granite, sedimentary rock, gypsum, and rock salt. Neutron production\nand transfer were simulated using the Geant4 and SHIELD transport codes. These\ncodes were tuned via a comparison of the results of calculations with\nexperimental data: in particular, with data of the Artemovsk research station\nof the Institute for Nuclear Research (INR, Moscow, Russia), as well as via an\nintercomparison of results of calculations with the Geant4 and SHIELD codes. It\nturns out that the atomic-number dependence of the production and yield of\nneutrons has an irregular character and does not allow a description in terms\nof a universal function of the atomic number. The parameters of this dependence\nare different for two groups of nuclei-nuclei consisting of alpha particles and\nall of the remaining nuclei. Moreover, there are manifest exceptions from a\npower-law dependence, for example, argon. This may entail important\nconsequences both for the existing underground experimental facilities and for\nthose under construction. Investigation of cosmic-ray-induced neutron\nproduction in various materials is of paramount importance for the\ninterpretation of experiments conducted at large depths under the Earth's\nsurface.\n", "  Motivated by the idea that, in the background-independent framework of a\nQuantum Theory of Gravity, entanglement is expected to play a key role in the\nreconstruction of spacetime geometry, we investigate the possibility of using\nthe formalism of Geometric Quantum Mechanics (GQM) to give a tensorial\ncharacterization of entanglement on spin network states. Our analysis focuses\non the simple case of a single link graph (Wilson line state) for which we\ndefine a dictionary to construct a Riemannian metric tensor and a symplectic\nstructure on the space of states. The manifold of (pure) quantum states is then\nstratified in terms of orbits of equally entangled states and the\nblock-coefficient matrices of the corresponding pulled-back tensors fully\nencode the information about separability and entanglement. In particular, the\noff-diagonal blocks define an entanglement monotone interpreted as a distance\nwith respect to the separable state. As such, it provides a measure of graph\nconnectivity. Finally, in the maximally entangled gauge-invariant case, the\nentanglement monotone is proportional to a power of the area of the surface\ndual to the link. This suggests a connection between the GQM formalism and the\n(simplicial) geometric properties of spin network states through entanglement.\n", "  We study propagation of traveling waves in a blood filled elastic artery with\nan axially symmetric dilatation (an idealized aneurysm) in long-wave\napproximation.The processes in the injured artery are modelled by equations for\nthe motion of the wall of the artery and by equation for the motion of the\nfluid (the blood). For the case when balance of nonlinearity, dispersion and\ndissipation in such a medium holds the model equations are reduced to a version\nof the Korteweg-deVries-Burgers equation with variable coefficients. Exact\ntravelling-wave solution of this equation is obtained by the modified method of\nsimplest equation where the differential equation of Riccati is used as a\nsimplest equation. Effects of the dilatation geometry on the travelling-wave\nprofile are considered.\n", "  The Large European Array for Pulsars combines Europe's largest radio\ntelescopes to form a tied-array telescope that provides high signal-to-noise\nobservations of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with the objective to increase the\nsensitivity of detecting low-frequency gravitational waves. As part of this\nendeavor we have developed a software correlator and beamformer which enables\nthe formation of a tied-array beam from the raw voltages from each of\ntelescopes. We explain the concepts and techniques involved in the process of\nadding the raw voltages coherently. We further present the software processing\npipeline that is specifically designed to deal with data from widely spaced,\ninhomogeneous radio telescopes and describe the steps involved in preparing,\ncorrelating and creating the tied-array beam. This includes polarization\ncalibration, bandpass correction, frequency dependent phase correction,\ninterference mitigation and pulsar gating. A link is provided where the\nsoftware can be obtained.\n", "  The LIGO results are among the greatest experimental achievements of all\ntimes. Time and again scientists have compared this feat to Galileo pointing\nhis telescope to the sky, offering instead an 'ear' to the cosmos. After the\nremarkable landmark of detection, the physics community will soon turn into the\nstudy of the properties of the sources, addressing fundamental questions in\nastrophysics and cosmology. A combined numerical and analytic effort to tackle\nthe binary problem is of paramount importance in light of the nascent program\nof multi-messenger astronomy. The century of gravitational wave science is in\nthe making, and many discoveries are yet to come in the advent of a new era of\n'precision gravity'.\n", "  We work with small non-selfadjoint perturbations of a selfadjoint quantum\nHamiltonian with two degrees of freedom, assuming that the principal symbol of\nthe selfadjoint part is (classically) a nearly integrable system, together with\na globally non-degenerate condition. We define a monodromy directly from the\nspectrum of such an operator, in the semiclassical limit. Moreover, this\nspectral monodromy allows to detect the topological modification on the\ndynamics of the nearly integrable system. It can be identified with the\nmonodromy for KAM invariant tori of the nearly integrable system.\n", "  Within the shoving model of the glass transition, the relaxation time and the\nviscosity are related to the local cage rigidity. This approach can be extended\ndown to the atomic-level in terms of the interatomic interaction, or potential\nof mean-force. We applied this approach to both real metallic glass-formers and\nmodel Lennard-Jones glasses. The main outcome of this analysis is that in\nmetallic glasses the thermal expansion contribution is mostly independent of\ncomposition and is uncorrelated with the interatomic repulsion: as a\nconsequence, the fragility increases upon increasing the interatomic repulsion\nsteepness. In the Lennard-Jones glasses, the scenario is opposite: thermal\nexpansion and interatomic repulsion contributions are strongly correlated, and\nthe fragility decreases upon increasing the repulsion steepness. This framework\nallows one to tell apart systems where \"soft atoms make strong glasses\" from\nthose where, instead, \"soft atoms make fragile glasses\". Hence, it opens up the\nway for the rational, atomistic tuning of the fragility and viscosity of widely\ndifferent glass-forming materials all the way from strong to fragile.\n", "  We are addressing the sites of isolated low mass star formation in the solar\nneighbourhood, i.e. small cloud cores within one kiloparsec. We aim at\ndetermining the physical parameters of the cores, i.e., temperature, volume\ndensity, column density and (radial) velocity fields, and the status of star\nformation, i.e., whether embedded objects are present within the cores.\nSurveying small dark clouds in both celestial hemispheres we study the physical\nconditions of low-mass star formation for detectable core masses M>0.01Msun.\nThe target list is drawn from catalogues of optically selected dark cloud\ncores, where the visual extinction exceeds 5 magnitudes. The selected probe is\nthe CS molecule that needs high densities for excitation of its rotational\nlevels. To gauge the state of excitation, the cores were observed in two\ntransitions. In a limited number of cases, optical depths were derived from\ncomplementing lines of the rarer isotopologue C34S for the (2-1) and (3-2)\ntransitions. Making small (3arcmin by 3arcmin) maps, the 471 optically selected\ncores were searched for CS(2-1) and 315 (67%) were detected (T_A*>3sigma). In\ngeneral, the position of peak CS emission does not coincide with the optically\ndetermined centre of the cores. The cores appear cold (T<10K) and, in the\nmajority of cases, the CS emission is optically thin (tau<1). On the arcminute\nscales of the observations, the median column density of carbon monosulfide is\nN(CS)=7.E12/cm2. For an average abundance of N(CS)/N(H2)=1.E-8, the median mass\nof the detected cores is 1.0Msun. The line shapes are most often Gaussian with\nwidths exceeding that due to thermal broadening of <0.1km/s. The observed\nmedian FWHM=0.7km/s, i.e. non-thermal turbulence contributes dominantly to the\nline widths\n", "  The mechanical, structural, electronic and magnetic properties of s-triazine\nsheet (C6N6) with embedded Mn atom (Mn-C6N6) is investigated under the\ninfluence of external environment using density functional theory. Our results\nshow that Mn-C6N6 system is structurally and mechanically stable. The binding\nenergy of Mn embedded in C6N6 sheet can be modulated under the influence of\nsymmetric deformation and perpendicular electric field respectively. The\nsemiconducting property of pure C6N6 sheet is maintained upon embedment of Mn\natom in the porous site. It is also found that small increment in bi-axial\ntensile strain enhances the band gap (from 0.630 eV at zero strain to 0.802 eV\nat 5% strain) while the magnetic moment of the embedded Mn atom is preserved.\nThe electronic and magnetic properties of the Mn-C6N6 systems are maintained up\nto 10 V/nm in electric field strength. We also explore the geometries,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of Mn-C6N6 with adsorbed atoms and\nmolecules. The Mn-C6N6 with adsorbed O atom and O2 molecule systems shows\nhalf-metallic character whereas the remaining systems preserve their\nsemiconducting property. The total magnetic moment per unit cell in most of the\nsystems is found to reduce as compared to that of the Mn-C6N6 sheet. The\nreduction in magnetic moment can be related to the strong interactions among\nthe Mn atom and the surrounding atoms which lead to the formation of low-spin\nconfigurations. Overall, our results indicate that the Mn-C6N6 systems with and\nwithout adsorbed atoms and molecules can serve as potential candidates for\nfuture spintronics and catalysis applications.\n", "  Space-division multiplexing (SDM), whereby multiple spatial channels in\nmultimode and multicore optical fibers are used to increase the total\ntransmission capacity per fiber, is being investigated to avert a data capacity\ncrunch and reduce the cost per transmitted bit. With the number of channels\nemployed in SDM transmission experiments continuing to rise, there is a\nrequirement for integrated SDM components that are scalable. Here, we\ndemonstrate a cladding-pumped SDM erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) that\nconsists of six uncoupled multimode erbium-doped cores. Each core supports\nthree spatial modes, which enables the EDFA to amplify a total of 18 spatial\nchannels simultaneously with a single pump diode and a complexity similar to a\nsingle-mode EDFA. The amplifier delivers more than 20-dBm total output power\nper core and less than 7-dB noise figure over the C-band. This cladding-pumped\nEDFA enables combined space-division and wavelength-division multiplexed\ntransmission over multiple multimode fiber spans.\n", "  Energy spectra of galactic cosmic rays calculated within the framework of the\nNoRD (nonlocal relativistic diffusion) model are presented. The model accounts\nfor the turbulent character of the interstellar medium and the relativistic\nspeed limit requirement. Calculations account for spiral distribution of\nsources, boundedness of halo, spallation of nuclei, energy dependence of the\ndiffusion coefficient, tempered power law injection spectrum. We show that the\nknee in the background spectra from the ensemble of supernovae can arise due to\nrelativistic speed limit requirement. We compare our calculations with the\nresults obtained in frames of the local models (LoD and LoRD) and nonlocal\nnonrelativistic model (NoD).\n", "  The spider silk is one of the most interesting bio-materials investigated in\nthe last years. One of the main reasons that brought scientists to study this\norganized system is its high level of resistance if compared to other\nartificial materials characterized by higher density. Subsequently, researchers\ndiscovered that the spider silk is a complex system formed by different kinds\nof proteins, organized (or disorganized) to guarantee the required resistance,\nwhich is function of the final application and of the environmental conditions.\nSome spider species are able to make different silks, up to twelve, having a\ncomposition that seems to be function of the final use (i.e. dragline web,\ncapture web, etc). The aim of this paper is to analyze the properties of the\nspider silk by means of a thermodynamic approach, taking advantage of the\nwell-known theories applied to polymers, and to try to underline and develop\nsome intriguing considerations. Moreover, this study can be taken as an example\nto introduce and discuss the importance of the concept of optionality and of\nthe anti-fragile systems proposed by N. N. Thaleb in his book \"Antifragile:\nThings that gain from disorder\".\n", "  We fit 12 independent surface temperature time series (zones of latitude), 6\nland- and 6 ocean-based, with a Gaussian (centered around WW2) on a quadratic\nbackground. The four polar zones are unusable. Each of the remaining 8 shows\nevidence of a 0.2-0.3 degree C bump, although one zone is dropped from the\nfinal analysis because of an aberrant fit. Thus, we find that a surface\ntemperature increase around WW2 is a robust, statistically significant (5.2\nsigma) feature of the data, and must either be a coincidence, due to systematic\nerror that came and went around WW2, or direct evidence of the effect of human\nactivity (an increase in combustion of various sorts) on the global climate.\nThe fact that, at least in that era, the temperature recovered quickly, is\nencouraging. On the other hand, extrapolation of the background temperature\nrise predicts an increase of 0.5 degree C in the next 20 years if conditions\nremain the same.\n", "  In this work, it is presented an optical scheme for quantum key distribution\nemploying two synchronized optoelectronic oscillators (OEO) working in the\nchaotic regime. The produced key depends on the chaotic dynamic and the\nsynchronization between Alice's and Bob's OEOs uses quantum states. An attack\non the synchronization signals will disturb the synchronization of the chaotic\nsystems increasing the error rate in the final key.\n", "  We studied the construction problem of the unextendible product basis (UPB).\nWe mainly give a method to construct a UPB of a quantum system through the UPBs\nof its subsystem. Using this method and the UPBs which are known for us, we\nconstruct different kinds of UPBs in general bipartite quantum system. Then we\nuse these UPBs to construct a family of UPBs in multipartite quantum system.\nThe UPBs can be used to construct the bound entangled states with different\nranks.\n", "  We investigate possible scenarios of light-squark production at the LHC as a\nnew mechanism to produce Higgs bosons in association with jets. The study is\nmotivated by the SUSY search for H+jets events, performed by the CMS\ncollaboration on 8 and 13 TeV data using the razor variables. Two simplified\nmodels are proposed to interpret the observations in this search. The\nconstraint from Run I and the implications for Run II and beyond are discussed.\n", "  Understanding the mixing capability of mixing devices based on their\ngeometric shape is an important issue both for predicting mixing processes and\nfor designing new mixers. The flow patterns in mixers are directly connected\nwith the modes of the local strain rate, which is generally a combination of\nelongational flow and planar shear flow. We develop a measure to characterize\nthe modes of the strain rate for general flow occurring in mixers. The spatial\ndistribution of the volumetric strain rate (or non-planar strain rate) in\nconnection with the flow pattern plays an essential role in understanding\ndistributive mixing. With our measure, flows with different types of screw\nelements in a twin-screw extruder are numerically analyzed. The difference in\nflow pattern structure between conveying screws and kneading disks is\nsuccessfully characterized by the distribution of the volumetric strain rate.\nThe results suggest that the distribution of the strain rate mode offers an\nessential and convenient way for characterization of the relation between flow\npattern structure and the mixer geometry.\n", "  All physical interactions are mediated by forces. Ultra-sensitive force\nmeasurements are therefore a crucial tool for investigating the fundamental\nphysics of magnetic, atomic, quantum, and surface phenomena. Laser cooled\ntrapped atomic ions are a well controlled quantum system and a standard\nplatform for precision metrology. Their low mass, strong Coulomb interaction,\nand readily detectable fluorescence signal make trapped ions favourable for\nperforming high-sensitivity force measurements. Here we demonstrate a\nthree-dimensional sub-attonewton sensitivity force sensor based on\nsuper-resolution imaging of the fluorescence from a single laser cooled\n$^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in a Paul trap. The force is detected by measuring the net\nion displacement with nanometer precision, and does not rely on mechanical\noscillation. Observed sensitivities were 372$\\pm$9$_\\mbox{stat}$,\n347$\\pm$12$_\\mbox{sys}\\pm$14$_\\mbox{stat}$, and\n808$\\pm$29$_\\mbox{sys}\\pm$42$_\\mbox{stat}$ zN/$\\sqrt{\\mbox{Hz}}$ in the three\ndimensions, corresponding to 24x, 87x, and 21x of the quantum limit. We\nindependently verified the accuracy of this apparatus by measuring a light\npressure force of 95 zN on the ion, an important systematic effect in any\noptically based force sensor. This technique can be applied for sensing DC or\nlow frequency forces external to the trap or internally from a co-trapped\nbiomolecule or nanoparticle.\n", "  Charge transfer among individual atoms in a molecule is the key concept in\nthe modern electronic theory of chemical bonding. In this work, we defined an\natomic region between two atoms by Slater orbital exponents of valence\nelectrons and suggested a method for analytical calculation of charge\npenetration between all atoms in a molecule. Computation of charge penetration\namount is self-consistently performed until each orbital exponent converges to\nits certain values respectively. Charge penetration matrix was calculated for\nethylene and MgO, and bonding charge and its distribution were analyzed by\nusing the charge penetration matrix and the orbital exponents under the bonding\nstate. These results were compared with those by density function method and\nshowed that this method is a simple and direct method to obtain bonding charge\ndistribution of molecule from atomic orbital functions.\n", "  We calculate the production of large-pTcharmonium and narrow resonance state\n(exotic charmonium) in proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions with the semi-coherent two-photon interactions at Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider (RHIC), Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and Future Circular Collider\n(FCC) energies. Using the large quasi-real photon fluxes, we present the\n\\gamma\\gamma->H differential cross section for charmonium and narrow resonance\nstate production at large transverse momentum in ultra-peripheral heavy ion\ncollisions. The numerical results demonstrate that the experimental study of\nultra-peripheral col-lisions is feasible at RHIC, LHC, and FCC energies.\n", "  In this paper we consider Huang--Li nonlinear financial system recently\nstudied in the literature. It has the form of three first order differential\nequations \\[ \\dot x=z+(y-a)x,\\quad \\dot y=1-b y-x^2,\\quad \\dot z=-x-c z, \\]\nwhere $(a,b,c)$ are real positive parameters. We show that this system is not\nintegrable in the class of functions meromorphic in variables $(x,y,z)$. We\ngive an analytic proof of this fact analysing properties the of differential\nGalois group of variational equations along certain particular solutions of the\nsystem.\n", "  Two versions of the semi-classical Jaynes--Cummings model without the\nrotating wave approximation are investigated. It is shown that for a non-zero\nvalue of the coupling constant the version introduced by Belobrov, Zaslavsky,\nand Tartakovsky is Hamiltonian with respect to a certain degenerated Poisson\nbracket. Moreover, it is shown that both models are not integrable.\n", "  Here, we report by first-principles calculations one new stable 2D Dirac\nmaterial, Ta2Se3 monolayer. For this system, stable layered bulk phase exists,\nand exfoliation should be possible. Ta2Se3 monolayer is demonstrated to support\ntwo Dirac points close to the Fermi level, achieving the exotic 2D double Dirac\nsemimetal. And like 2D single Dirac and 2D node-line semimetals, spin-orbit\ncoupling could introduce an insulating state in this new class of 2D Dirac\nsemimetals. Moreover, the Dirac feature in this system is layer-dependent and a\nmetal-to-insulator transition is identified in Ta2Se3 when reducing the\nlayer-thickness from bilayer to monolayer. These findings are of fundamental\ninterests and of great importance for nanoscale device applications.\n", "  The search for new superconducting compounds with higher critical\ntemperatures $T_{c}^{\\prime}$s has long been the very heart of scientific\nresearch on superconductivity. It took 75 years for scientists to push the\n$T_{c}$ above liquid nitrogen boiling temperature since the discovery of\nsuperconductivity. So far, the record high $T_{c}$ of about 130 K at atmosphere\npressure was reported in some multilayer Hg(Tl)-Ba-Ca-Cu-O compounds.\nMeanwhile, sulfur hydride system holds the highest $T_{c}$ of around 200 K at\nhigh pressure of about 150 GPa. While keeping these records for\nsuperconductivity, either the toxicity of these superconductors or the\nrequirement of extreme pressure condition for superconductivity limits their\ntechnology applications. Here we show that doping a chain link molecule $-$\n$p$-terphenyl by potassium can bring about superconductivity at 123 K at\natmosphere pressure, which is comparable to the highest $T_{c}$ in cuprates.\nThe easy processability, light weight, durability of plastics, and\nenvironmental friendliness of this kind of new superconductor have great\npotential for the fine-tuning of electrical properties. This study opens a\nwindow for exploring high temperature superconductivity in chain link organic\nmolecules.\n", "  This chapter describes spin-wave excitations in nanosized dots and rings in\nthe presence of the vortex state. The special attention is paid to the\nmanifestation of the competition between exchange and dipolar interactions in\nthe spin-wave spectrum as well as the correlation between the spectrum and the\nstability of the vortex. The calculation method uses the dynamic matrix for an\nall-discrete system, the numerical diagonalization of which yields the spectrum\nof frequencies and spin-wave profiles of normal modes of the dot. We study\nin-plane vortices of two types: a circular magnetization in circular dots and\nrings and the Landau state in square rings. We examine the influence of the\ndipolar-exchange competition and the geometry of the dot on the stability of\nthe vortex and on the spectrum of spin waves. We show that the lowest-frequency\nmode profile proves to be indicative of the dipolar-to-exchange interaction\nratio and the vortex stability is closely related to the spin-wave profile of\nthe soft mode. The negative dispersion relation is also shown. Our results\nobtained for in-plane vortices are in qualitative agreement with results for\ncore-vortices obtained from experiments, micromagnetic simulations, and\nanalytical calculations.\n", "  We report the design, fabrication, and characterization of bianisotropic\nHuygens' metasurfaces (BHMSs) for refraction of normally incident beams towards\n71.8 degrees. As previously shown, all three BHMS degrees of freedom, namely,\nelectric polarizability, magnetic polarizability and omega-type magnetoelectric\ncoupling, are required to ensure no reflections occur for such wide-angle\nimpedance mismatch. The unit cells are composed of three metallic layers,\nyielding a printed-circuit-board (PCB) structure. The fabricated BHMS is\ncharacterized in a quasi-optical setup, used to accurately assess specular\nreflections. Subsequently, the horn-illuminated BHMS' radiation pattern is\nmeasured in a far-field chamber, to evaluate the device's refraction\ncharacteristics. The measured results verify that the BHMS has negligible\nreflections, and the majority of the scattered power is coupled to the\ndesirable Floquet-Bloch mode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nexperimental demonstration of such a reflectionless wide-angle refracting\nmetasurface.\n", "  This paper concerns an investigation of the spin wave excitations in magnetic\nnanoparticles. We provide a detailed derivation of the theoretical method for\nthe determination of the normal modes of confined magnetic systems based on a\ndiscrete lattice of magnetic moments. The method is based on the damping-free\nLandau-Lifshitz equation and general enough to be utilized for the magnetic\nsystem of any dimensionality, magnetic structure, shape, and size. As an\nexample we explore the influence of the competition between exchange and\ndipolar interactions on the spectrum of normal modes as well as on the\nstability of the vortex state in two-dimensional nanorings. We show the\nlowest-frequency mode to be indicative of the dipolar-to-exchange iterations\nratio. We also study behavior of the fundamental mode and present the influence\nof both, the discreteness of the lattice and the dipolar-to-exchange iterations\nratio, on its hybridization with azimuthal modes. We complete the paper with a\nselective review of the spin wave excitations in circular dots to compare with\nthe results obtained for the rings.\n", "  We use results from a 6-th order Taylor expansion of the QCD equation of\nstate to construct expansions for cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations\nand their correlations. We show that these cumulants strongly constrain the\nrange of applicability of hadron resonance gas model calculations. We point out\nthat the latter is inappropriate to describe equilibrium properties of QCD at\nzero and non-zero values of the baryon chemical potential already at T~155 MeV.\n", "  The elastic, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties of recently\ndiscovered and potentially technologically important transition metal boride\nNbRuB, have been investigated using the density functional formalism. Both\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) and local density approximation (LDA)\nwere used for geometrical optimization and for estimation of various elastic\nmoduli and constants. The optical properties of NbRuB have been studied for the\nfirst time with different photon polarizations. The frequency (energy)\ndependences of various optical constants compliment quite well to the essential\nfeatures of the electronic band structure calculations. Debye temperature of\nNbRuB has been estimated form the thermodynamical study. All these theoretical\nestimates have been compared with published results, where available, and\ndiscussed in detail. Both electronic band structure and optical conductivity\nreveal robust metallic characteristics. NbRuB possesses significant elastic and\nelectronic anisotropy. The effects of electronic band structure and Debye\ntemperature on the emergence of superconductivity have also been analyzed.\n", "  We demonstrate that the intermediate inflation scenario, is a singular\ninflation cosmology, with the singularity at the origin $t=0$ being a pressure\nand energy density singularity and particularly a Type III singularity. Also,\nwe show that the expanding phase of a singular bounce, can be identical to the\nintermediate inflation scenario, if the singular bounce has a Type III\nsingularity at the origin. For the intermediate inflation scenario we examine\nthe cosmological implications on the power spectrum in the context of various\nforms of modified gravity. Particularly we calculate the power spectrum in the\ncontext of $F(R)$, $F(G)$ Gauss-Bonnet gravity and also for $F(T)$ gravity and\nwe discuss the viability of each scenario by comparing the resulting spectral\nindex with the latest observational data.\n", "  The covariant canonical formalism is a covariant extension of the traditional\ncanonical formalism of fields. In contrast to the traditional canonical theory,\nit has a remarkable feature that canonical equations of gauge theories or\ngravity are not only manifestly Lorentz covariant but also gauge covariant or\ndiffeomorphism covariant. A mathematical peculiarity of the covariant canonical\nformalism is that its canonical coordinates are differential forms on a\nmanifold. In the present paper, we find a natural Poisson bracket of this new\ncanonical theory, and study symplectic structure behind it. The phase space of\nthe theory is identified with a ringed space with the structure sheaf of the\ngraded algebra of \"differentiable\" differential forms on the manifold. The\nPoisson and the symplectic structure we found can be even or odd, depending on\nthe dimension of the manifold. Our Poisson structure is an example of physical\napplication of Poisson structure defined on the graded algebra of differential\nforms.\n", "  Nuclear systems are treated within a quantum statistical approach.\nCorrelations and cluster formation are relevant for the properties of warm\ndense matter, but the description is challenging and different approximations\nare discussed. The equation of state, the composition, Bose condensation of\nbound fermions, the disappearance of bound states at increasing density because\nof Pauli blocking are of relevance for different applications in astrophysics,\nheavy ion collisions, and nuclear structure.\n", "  THz time domain spectroscopy is a powerful technique enabling the\ninvestigation of different materials in the far-infrared frequency range. Even\nif nowadays this technique is well established, its application to very thin\nfilms remains particularly difficult. We investigated the utilization of THz\nspectroscopy on samples of micrometric thickness with the aim to disentangle\nmultiple reflections and to measure with high accuracy the absolute values of\nthe material parameters. We implemented an experimental and data analysis\nprocedure that can be applied to free-standing single-layers or multi-layers\nsamples. Specifically, we report on the experimental investigation by THz time\ndomain spectroscopy of two samples: a test sample made of two layers of known\nthickness and materials; and a second sample, that is of a great interest for\ncultural heritage studies, made of a thin film of ink layered on a thicker\nsupport. Moreover, we describe in details the data analysis and fitting\nprocedures needed to extract the material parameters from the experimental\nresults.\n", "  Two-dimensional turbulent flows, and to some extent, geophysical flows, are\nsystems with a large number of degrees of freedom, which, albeit fluctuating,\nexhibit some degree of organization: coherent structures emerge spontaneously\nat large scales. In this short course, we show how the principles of\nequilibrium statistical mechanics apply to this problem and predict the\ncondensation of energy at large scales and allow for computing the resulting\ncoherent structures. We focus on the structure of the theory using the language\nof large deviation theory.\n", "  In the long wavelength limit, Maxwell-Chern-Simmon model and the dynamics of\na particle in a plane under an external magnetic field perpendicular to that\nplane are identical. The self adjoint extension of such a problem depends on\nthe value of angular momentum quantum number $l$. In this article, we have\nshown that for $l\\neq 0$, the operator describing the Landau level\nwave-function is self adjoint; whereas, for $l=0$, infinite number of\nself-adjoint extension by an one parameter unitary mapping is possible.\n", "  Physical theories can be characterized in terms of their state spaces and\ntheir evolutive equations. The kinematical structure and the dynamical\nstructure of finite dimensional quantum theory are, in light of the\nChoi-Jamio{\\l}kowski isomorphism, one and the same --- namely the homogeneous\nself-dual cones of positive semi-definite linear endomorphisms on finite\ndimensional complex Hilbert spaces. From the perspective of category theory,\nthese cones are the sets of morphisms in finite dimensional quantum theory as a\ndagger compact closed category. Understanding the intricate geometry of these\ncones and charting the wider landscape for their host category is imperative\nfor foundational physics. In Part I of this thesis, we study the shape of\nfinite dimensional quantum theory in terms of quantum information. In Part II\nof this thesis, we move beyond quantum theory within the vein of Euclidean\nJordan algebras. In posting this thesis on the arXiv, we hope that it might\nserve as a useful resource for those interested in its subjects.\n", "  The description of the transport of cosmic rays in magnetized media is\ncentral to both acceleration and propagation of these particles in our Galaxy\nand outside. The investigation of the process of particle acceleration,\nespecially at shock waves, has already emphasized that non-linear effects such\nas self-generation of waves and dynamical reaction of cosmic rays on the\nbackground plasmas, are crucial if to achieve a physical understanding of the\norigin of cosmic rays. Here we discuss how similar non-linear effects on\nGalactic scales may affect the propagation of cosmic rays, not only through the\nexcitation of plasma waves important for particle scattering, but also by\ninducing the motion of the interstellar medium in the direction opposite to the\ngravitational pull exerted by matter in the Galaxy, thereby resulting in the\nlaunching of a wind. The recent discovery of several unexpected features in\ncosmic ray spectra (discrepant hardening, spectral breaks in the H and He\nspectra, rising positron fraction and unexpectedly hard antiproton spectrum)\nraises the question of whether at least some of these effects may be attributed\nto poorly understood aspects of cosmic ray transport.\n", "  Recently the dynamics of signed networks, where the ties among the agents can\nbe both positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) have attracted\nsubstantial attention of the research community. Examples of such networks are\nmodels of opinion dynamics over signed graphs, recently introduced by Altafini\n(2012,2013) and extended to discrete-time case by Meng et al. (2014). It has\nbeen shown that under mild connectivity assumptions these protocols provide the\nconvergence of opinions in absolute value, whereas their signs may differ. This\n\"modulus consensus\" may correspond to the polarization of the opinions (or\nbipartite consensus, including the usual consensus as a special case), or their\nconvergence to zero. In this paper, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of\nmodulus consensus in the discrete-time Altafini model is a manifestation of a\nmore general and profound fact, regarding the solutions of a special recurrent\ninequality. Although such a recurrent inequality does not provide the\nuniqueness of a solution, it can be shown that, under some natural assumptions,\neach of its bounded solutions has a limit and, moreover, converges to\nconsensus. A similar property has previously been established for special\ncontinuous-time differential inequalities (Proskurnikov, Cao, 2016). Besides\nanalysis of signed networks, we link the consensus properties of recurrent\ninequalities to the convergence analysis of distributed optimization algorithms\nand the problems of Schur stability of substochastic matrices.\n", "  Using a thermal gas, we model the signal of a trapped interferometer. This\ninterferometer uses two short laser pulses, separated by time T, which act as a\nphase grating for the matter waves. Near time 2T, there is an echo in the\ncloud's density due to the Talbot-Lau effect. Our model uses the Wigner\nfunction approach and includes a weak residual harmonic trap. The analysis\nshows that the residual potential limits the interferometer's visibility,\nshifts the echo time of the interferometer, and alters its time dependence.\nLoss of visibility can be mitigated by optimizing the initial trap frequency\njust before the interferometer cycle begins.\n", "  We prove that the Parisi measure of the mixed p-spin model at zero\ntemperature has infinitely many points in its support. This establishes\nParisi's prediction that the functional order parameter of the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick model is not a step function at zero temperature. As a\nconsequence, we show that the number of levels of broken replica symmetry in\nthe Parisi formula of the free energy diverges as the temperature goes to zero.\n", "  We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the\nproperties of the energy gap(s) in optimally doped (Bi,Pb)2(Sr,La)2CuO6+d\n(Bi2201). We find that the spectral gap has two components in the\nsuperconducting state: a superconducting gap and pseudogap. Significant\ndifferences in their momentum and temperature dependence suggest that they\nrepresent two separate energy scales. Spectra near the node reveal a sharp peak\nwith a small gap below Tc that closes at Tc. Near the antinode, the spectra are\nbroad with a large energy gap of ~40meV above and below Tc. The spectral shape\nand gap magnitude around the antinode are almost constant across Tc, which\nindicates that the pseudogap state coexists with the superconducting state\nbelow Tc, and it dominates the character of the spectra around the antinode. We\nspeculate that the pseudogap state competes with the superconductivity by\ndiminishing spectral weight in the antinodal regions, where the magnitude of\nthe superconducting gap is largest.\n"]}
