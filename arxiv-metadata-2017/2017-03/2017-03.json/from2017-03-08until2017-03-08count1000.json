The high sensitivity of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellations to\nthe local point distribution is used to obtain estimates of density and related\nquantities. The adaptive and minimum triangulation properties of Delaunay\ntessellations are utilized for interpolation to continuous volume-covering\ndensity and velocity fields. The adaptivity to the local density and geometry\npreserves three key characteristics of the cosmic matter distribution: 1) its\nhierarchical nature,2) its anisotropic weblike morphology, 3) the presence and\nstructure of voids. The lecture notes discuss the mathematical context and\nbackground of the DTFE method, in essence a first order version of Natural\nNeighbour methods, smooth and higher order spatial interpolation techniques.\nThis is followed by an outline of the DTFE procedure. A series of tests on\nspatially complex point distributions provides quantitative information on its\nperformance and noise characteristics. We conclude with a few cosmological\napplications. The reconstruction of the spatial weblike patterns in N-body\nsimulations and in the 2dFGRS provide a visual impression of DTFE's\nperformance. The analysis of the velocity divergence pdf and maps obtained of\nthe velocity flow in the Local Universe (implied by PSCz) illustrate its\npromise for probing the dynamics of cosmic structure. The Watershed Void Finder\n(Platen et al. 2007), for the study of voids, and Multiscale Morphology Filter\n(Aragon-Calvo et al. 2007), for identifying and analyzing weblike networks of\nfilaments, sheets and clusters, are based upon DTFE density fields. We also\nmention SimpleX, a related random lattice radiative transfer formalism\n(Ritzerveld & Icke 2006).\n", "  Traumatic brain injury [TBI] has become a signature injury of current\nmilitary conflicts, with debilitating, costly, and long-lasting effects.\nAlthough mechanisms by which head impacts cause TBI have been well-researched,\nthe mechanisms by which blasts cause TBI are not understood. From numerical\nhydrodynamic simulations, we have discovered that non-lethal blasts can induce\nsufficient skull flexure to generate potentially damaging loads in the brain,\neven without a head impact. The possibility that this mechanism may contribute\nto TBI has implications for injury diagnosis and armor design.\n", "  Motion of the keys was measured in a transverse flute while beginner, amateur\nand professional flutists played a range of exercises. The time taken for a key\nto open or close is typically 10 ms when pushed by a finger or 16 ms when moved\nby a spring. Delays between the motion of the fingers were typically tens of\nms, with longer delays as more fingers are involved. Because the opening and\nclosing of keys will never be exactly simultaneous, transitions between notes\nthat involve the movement of multiple fingers can occur via several possible\npathways with different intermediate fingerings. A transition is classified as\n`safe' if it is possible to be slurred from the initial to final note with\nlittle perceptible change in pitch or volume. Some transitions are `unsafe' and\npossibly involve a transient change in pitch or a decrease in volume. In\ntransitions with multiple fingers, players, on average, used safe transitions\nmore frequently than unsafe transitions. Professionals exhibited smaller\naverage delays between the motion of fingers than did amateurs.\n", "  The classical dynamics and pulse propagation are presented for a series of\nlattice-like structures whose spatial dimensionality ranges from one to four:\nfour representing a hyper lattice. The lattices are connected one-dimensional\nwave bearing systems of varying lengths and can illuminate some aspects of\nhigher dimension structures. Short pulses are launched at an arbitrary point,\nreverberate throughout the entire structure, and detected at another point.\nSome aspects of increasing dimensionality are illustrated with particular\nemphasis on the transition from three to four spatial dimensions. In a\nhypothetical four dimension world where only three are observable, the\nclassical conservation laws and causality do not hold. The lack of causality is\nillustrated at each step in dimensionality by showing the unexpected pulse\nreturns from the next higher dimension.\n", "  A systematic study of noise barriers based on sonic crystals made of\ncylinders that use recycled materials like absorbing component is here\nreported. The barriers consist of only three rows of perforated metal shells\nfilled with rubber crumb. Measurements of reflectance and transmittance by\nthese barriers are reported. Their attenuation properties result from a\ncombination of sound absorption by the rubber crumb and reflection by the\nperiodic distribution of scatterers. It is concluded that porous cylinders can\nbe used as building blocks whose physical parameters can be optimized in order\nto design efficient barriers adapted to different noisy environments.\n", "  Observations conducted with the Fine Guidance Sensor on Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) providing high cadence and precision time-series photometry\nwere obtained over 10 consecutive days in December 2008 on the host star of the\ntransiting exoplanet HD 17156b. During this time 10^12 photons (corrected for\ndetector deadtime) were collected in which a noise level of 163 parts per\nmillion per 30 second sum resulted, thus providing excellent sensitivity to\ndetection of the analog of the solar 5-minute p-mode oscillations. For HD 17156\nrobust detection of p-modes supports determination of the stellar mean density\nof 0.5301 +/- 0.0044 g/cm^3 from a detailed fit to the observed frequencies of\nmodes of degree l = 0, 1, and 2. This is the first star for which direct\ndetermination of the mean stellar density has been possible using both\nasteroseismology and detailed analysis of a transiting planet light curve.\nUsing the density constraint from asteroseismology, and stellar evolution\nmodeling results in M_star = 1.285 +/- 0.026 solar, R_star = 1.507 +/- 0.012\nsolar, and a stellar age of 3.2 +/- 0.3 Gyr.\n", "  We propose a new consistent method to test of the distance-duality (DD)\nrelation which related angular diameter distances (DA) to the luminosity\ndistances (DL) in a cosmology-independent way. In order to avoid any bias\nbrought by redshift incoincidence between galaxy clusters and Type Ia Supernave\n(SNe Ia), as well as to ensure the integrity of the galaxy clusters samples, we\nobtain the luminosity distance of a certain SN Ia point at the same redshift of\nthe corresponding galaxy cluster by interpolating from the nearby SNe Ia. With\nthe observational data at the same redshifts of the angular diameter distances\nfrom the complete 38 galaxy cluster sample for the spherical model and the\ncorrected luminosity distances interpolated from the Union2 set, we find that\n$\\eta \\equiv {D_L}{(1+z)}^{-2}/{D_A}=1$ is satisfied within $2\\sigma$\nconfidence level for various parameterizations of $\\eta(z)$, which are more\nstringent than previous testing results without considering redshift bias.\n", "  We introduce the new concept of an EBV to assess the sensitivity of model\noutputs to changes in initial conditions for weather forecasting. The new\nalgorithm, which we call the \"Ensemble Bred Vector\" or EBV, is based on\ncollective dynamics in essential ways. By construction, the EBV algorithm\nproduces one or more dominant vectors.\n  We investigate the performance of EBV, comparing it to the BV algorithm as\nwell as the finite-time Lyapunov Vectors. We give a theoretical justification\nto the observed fact that the vectors produced by BV, EBV, and the finite-time\nLyapunov vectors are similar for small amplitudes.\n  Numerical comparisons of BV and EBV for the 3-equation Lorenz model and for a\nforced, dissipative partial differential equation of Cahn-Hilliard type that\narises in modeling the thermohaline circulation, demonstrate that the EBV\nyields a size-ordered description of the perturbation field, and is more robust\nthan the BV in the higher nonlinear regime. The EBV yields insight into the\nfractal structure of the Lorenz attractor, and of the inertial manifold for the\nCahn-Hilliard-type partial differential equation.\n", "  In these lectures I give an overview of gravitational lensing, concentrating\non theoretical aspects, including derivations of some of the important results.\nTopics covered include the determination of surface mass densities of\nintervening lenses, as well as the statistical analysis of distortions of\ngalaxy images by general inhomogeneities (cosmic shear), both in 2D projection\non the sky, and in 3D where source distance information is available. 3D mass\nreconstruction and the shear ratio test are also considered, and the\nsensitivity of observables to Dark Energy is used to show how its equation of\nstate may be determined using weak lensing.

In particular we include flexible\ndescriptions of intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias and photometric redshift\nuncertainties in a Fisher Matrix analysis of shear, position and position-shear\ncorrelations, including complementary cosmological constraints from the CMB. We\nstudy the impact of survey tradeoffs in depth versus breadth, and redshift\nquality. We parameterise the results in terms of the Dark Energy Task Force\nfigure of merit, and deviations from General Relativity through an analagous\nModified Gravity figure of merit. We find that intrinsic alignments weaken the\ndependence of figure of merit on area and that, for a fixed observing time, a\nfiducial Stage IV survey plateaus above roughly 10,000deg2 for DE and peaks at\nabout 5,000deg2 as the relative importance of IAs at low redshift penalises\nwide, shallow surveys. While reducing photometric redshift scatter improves\nconstraining power, the dependence is shallow. The variation in constraining\npower is stronger once IAs are included and is slightly more pronounced for MG\nconstraints than for DE. The inclusion of intrinsic alignments and galaxy\nposition information reduces the required prior on photometric redshift\naccuracy by an order of magnitude for both the fiducial Stage III and IV\nsurveys, equivalent to a factor of 100 reduction in the number of spectroscopic\ngalaxies required to calibrate the photometric sample.\n", "  It is believed that magnetic activity on the Sun and solar-type stars are\ntightly related to the dynamo process driven by the interaction between\nrotation, convection, and magnetic field. However, the detailed mechanisms of\nthis process are still incompletely understood. Many questions remain\nunanswered, e.g.: why some stars are more active than others?; why some stars\nhave a flat activity?; why is there a Maunder minimum?; are all the cycles\nregular? A large number of prox- ies are typically used to study the magnetic\nactivity of stars as we cannot resolve stellar discs. Recently, it was shown\nthat asteroseismology can also be used to study stellar activity, making it an\neven more powerful tool. If short cycles are not so un- common, we expect to\ndetect many of them with missions such as CoRoT, Kepler, and possibly the PLATO\nmission. We will review some of the latest results obtained with spectroscopic\nmeasurements. We will show how asteroseismology can help us to better\nunderstand the complex process of dynamo and illustrate how the CoRoT and\nKepler missions are revolutionizing our knowledge on stellar activity. A new\nwindow is being opened over our understanding of the magnetic variability of\nstars.\n", "  Why bother with asteroseismology while studying exoplanets? There are several\nanswers to this question. Asteroseismology and exoplanetary sciences have much\nin common and the synergy between the two opens up new aspects in both fields.\nThese fields and stellar activity, when taken together, allow maximum\nextraction of information from exoplanet space missions. Asteroseismology of\nthe host star has already proved its value in a number of exoplanet systems by\nits unprecedented precision in determining stellar parameters. In addition,\nasteroseismology allows the possibility of discovering new exoplanets through\ntime delay studies. The study of the interaction between exoplanets and their\nhost stars opens new windows on various physical processes. In this review I\nwill summarize past and current research in exoplanet asteroseismology and\nexplore some guidelines for the future.\n", "  Forthcoming experiments will enable us to determine high precision\ntomographic shear spectra. Matter density fluctuation spectra, at various $z$,\nshould then be worked out of them, in order to constrain the model and\ndetermine the DE state equation. Available analytical expressions, however, do\nthe opposite, enabling us to derive shear spectra from fluctuation spectra.\nHere we find the inverse expression, yielding density fluctuation spectra from\nobservational tomographic shear spectra. The procedure involves SVD techniques\nfor matrix inversion. We show in detail how the approach works and provide a\nfew examples.\n", "  Loop quantum cosmology is considered in inflation era. A slow roll scalar\nfield solution with power law potential is presented in the neighborhood of\ntransition time, i.e. when the universe enters inflation phase from\nsuper-inflation. The compatibility of the model with Planck 2013 data is\ndiscussed. The domain of validity of second and the generalized second laws of\nthermodynamics for this solution and some other examples is studied.\n", "  The structure of $^{35,37,39}$S isotopes is described by performing\ncomprehensive shell model calculations with SDPF-U and SDPFMW interactions.\nProtons and neutrons are restricted to the $sd$-shell for $N < 20$, neutrons\nstart to fill the $pf$-shell for $N > 20$. Natural parity states are described\nby only in-shell mixing, unnatural parity states with 1p-1h inter-shell neutron\nexcitations. With SDPF-U interaction, reported are the results for natural\nparity states only because this interaction is not suitable for cross shell\nexcitations. Calculated energy levels, electromagnetic properties and\nspectroscopic factors are in good agreement with the recently available\nexperimental data.\n", "  Stars are usually faint point sources and investigating their surfaces and\ninteriors observationally is very demanding. Here I give a review on the\nstate-of-the-art observing techniques and recent results on studying interiors\nand surface features of active stars.\n", "  We present a new exactly solvable quantum problem for which the Schroedinger\nequation allows for separation of variables in oblate spheroidal coordinates.\nNamely, this is the quantum mechanical two Coulomb centers problem for the case\nof imaginary intercenter parameter and complex conjugate charges is considered.\nSince the potential is defined by the two-sheeted mapping whose singularities\nare concentrated on a circle rather than at separate points, there arise\nadditional possibilities in choice of boundary conditions. Detailed\nclassification of the various types of boundary-value problems is given. The\nquasi-radial equation leads to a new type of boundary value problems which was\nnever considered before. Results of the numerical calculations allowing to draw\nconclusions about the structure of the energy spectrum are shown. Possible\nphysical applications are discussed.\n", "  Chromospheric activity has been calibrated and widely used as an age\nindicator. However, it has been suggested that the viability of this age\nindicator is, in the best case, limited to stars younger than about 1.5 Gyr. I\naim to define the age range for which chromospheric activity is a robust\nastrophysical clock. I collected literature measurements of the S-index in\nfield stars, which is a measure of the strength of the H and K lines of the Ca\nII and a proxy for chromospheric activity, and exploited the homogeneous\ndatabase of temperature and age determinations for field stars provided by the\nGeneva-Copenhagen survey of the solar neighbourhood. Field data, inclusive data\npreviously used to calibrate chromospheric ages, confirm the result found using\nopen cluster data, i.e. there is no decay of chromospheric activity after about\n2 Gyr. The only existing indication supporting the viability of chromospheric\nages older than 2 Gyr is the similarity of chromospheric activity levels in the\ncomponents of 35 dwarf binaries. However, even in the most optimistic scenario,\nuncertainty in age determination for field stars and lack of sufficient data in\nopen clusters make any attempt of calibrating an age activity relationship for\nold stars premature. The hypothesis that chromospheric activity follows the\nSkumanich law, i.e. that it is proportional to the inverse square root of the\nage, should be relaxed.\n", "  After carefully cross-identifying a previously discovered GALEX-selected\nLyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates one-to-one with their optical counterparts\nin the field of the CDF-S, we re-estimate their photometric redshifts using\nmulti-wavelength data from UV, optical to NIR. We refine a new updated sample\nof 383 LBGs at $0.7\\la z \\la 1.4$.\n  Most LBGs are classified as starburst and irregular types. Ages spread from\nseveral Myr to 1.5Gyr. Their dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and\nstellar masses ($M_*$) are from $4\\my$ to $220\\my$ and from $2.3\\times 10^8\n\\msun$ to $4 \\times 10^{11} \\msun$. The rest-frame FUV luminosity function of\nLBGs are presented. LBGs of irregular types mainly distribute along the \"main\nsequence\" of star forming galaxies while most LBGs of starburst types locate in\nthe starburst region. A \"downsizing\" effect is clearly found and LBGs\ndistribute in the \"blue\" cloud.\n  HST images in F606W ($V$ band) and F850LP ($z$ band) are taken from the GEMS\nand GOODS-S surveys. SExtractor and GALFIT are applied to get their\nmorphological parameters. A morphological sample of 142 LBGs with reliable\nresults of $\\sersic$ and sizes in both bands is defined. We find that LBGs at\n$z\\sim 1 $ are dominated by disk-like galaxies. Correlations between\nphotometric and morphological properties of LBGs are investigated. Strong\ncorrelations between their half-light radii and $M_*$, i.e., size-stellar mass\nrelations, are found in both bands. Physical connections between correlations\nand the \"downsizing\" effect are discussed.\n", "  In this note, we study cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on\nprimordial non-Gaussianity in DBI galileon models in which an induced gravity\nterm is added to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action. In this model, the\nnon-Gaussianity of orthogonal shape can be generated. We provide a relation\nbetween theoretical parameters and orthogonal/equilateral non-linear parameters\nusing the Fisher matrix approach for the CMB bispectrum. In doing so, we\ninclude the effect of the CMB transfer functions and experimental noise\nproperties by employing the recently developed \\textsf{SONG} code. The relation\nis also shown in the language of effective theory so that it can be applied to\ngeneral single-field models. Using the bispectrum Fisher matrix and the central\nvalues for equilateral and orthogonal non-Gaussianities found by the Planck\ntemperature survey, we provide forecasts on the theoretical parameters of the\nDBI galileon model. We consider the upcoming Planck polarisation data and the\nproposed post-Planck experiments COrE and PRISM. We find that Planck\npolarisation measurements may provide a hint for a non-canonical sound speed at\nthe 68% confidence level. COrE and PRISM will not only confirm a non-canonical\nsound speed but also exclude the conventional DBI inflation model at more than\nthe 95% and 99% confidence level respectively, assuming that the central values\nwill not change. This indicates that improving constraints on non-Gaussianity\nfurther by future CMB experiments is invaluable to constrain the physics of the\nearly universe.\n", "  The Chandra Deep Field is the region of the sky with the highest\nconcentration of X-ray data available: 4Ms of Chandra and 3Ms of XMM data,\nallowing excellent quality spectra to be extracted even for faint sources. We\ntake advantage of this in order to compile a sample of heavily obscured Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) using X-ray spectroscopy. We select our sample among the\n176 brightest XMM sources, searching for either a) flat X-ray spectra (Photon\nindex<1.4 at the 90% confidence level) suggestive of a reflection dominated\ncontinuum or b) an absorption turn-over suggestive of a column density higher\nthan ~10^{24} cm-2. We find a sample of nine candidate heavily obscured sources\nsatisfying the above criteria. Four of these show statistically significant\nFeKalpha lines with large equivalent widths (three out of four have EW\nconsistent with 1 keV) suggesting that these are the most secure Compton-thick\nAGN candidates. Two of these sources are transmission dominated while the other\ntwo are most probably reflection dominated Compton-thick AGN. Although this\nsample of four sources is by no means statistically complete, it represents the\nbest example of Compton-thick sources found at moderate-to-high redshift with\nthree sources at z=1.2-1.5 and one source at z=3.7. Using Spitzer and Herschel\nobservations, we estimate with good accuracy the X-ray to mid-IR (12 micron)\nluminosity ratio of our sources. These are well below the average AGN relation,\nindependently suggesting that these four sources are heavily obscured.\n", "  Deep ocean acoustics, in the absence of shipping and wildlife, is driven by\nsurface processes. Best understood is the signal generated by non-linear\nsurface wave interactions, the Longuet-Higgins mechanism, which dominates from\n0.1 to 10 Hz, and may be significant for another octave. For this source, the\nspectral matrix of pressure and vector velocity is derived for points near the\nbottom of a deep ocean resting on an elastic half-space. In the absence of a\nbottom, the ratios of matrix elements are universal constants. Bottom effects\nvitiate the usual \"standing wave approximation,\" but a weaker form of the\napproximation is shown to hold, and this is used for numerical calculations. In\nthe weak standing wave approximation, the ratios of matrix elements are\nindependent of the surface wave spectrum, but depend on frequency and the\npropagation environment. Data from the Hawaii-2 Observatory are in excellent\naccord with the theory for frequencies between 0.1 and 1 Hz, less so at higher\nfrequencies. Insensitivity of the spectral ratios to wind, and presumably\nwaves, is indeed observed in the data.\n", "  This note examines the influence of covariance inflation on the distance\nbetween the measured observation and the simulated (or predicted) observation\nwith respect to the state estimate. In order for the aforementioned distance to\nbe bounded in a certain interval, some sufficient conditions are derived,\nindicating that the covariance inflation factor should be bounded in a certain\ninterval, and that the inflation bounds are related to the maximum and minimum\neigenvalues of certain matrices. Implications of these analytic results are\ndiscussed, and a numerical experiment is presented to verify the validity of\nour analysis.\n", "  We present results of CO(1-0) spectroscopic observations of 10 SDSS type 2\nquasars (QSO2) at z~0.2-0.3 observed with the 30m IRAM radiotelescope and the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array. We report 5 new confirmed CO(1-0) detections\nand 1 tentative detection. They have L'(CO)~several x 1e9 K km s-1 pc^2, while\nupper limits for the non detections are L'(CO)<~ several x 1e9 K km s-1 pc^2.\nThis study increases the total number of QSO2 with CO measurements at z<~1 to\n20, with a 50% detection rate.\n", "  Simulations of galaxy growth need to invoke strong negative feedback from\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to suppress the formation of stars and thus\nprevent the over-production of very massive systems. While some observations\nprovide evidence for such negative feedback, other studies find either no\nfeedback, or even positive feedback, with increased star formation associated\nwith higher AGN luminosities. Here we report an analysis of several hundred AGN\nand their host galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field South using X-ray and radio\ndata for sample selection. Combined with archival far infrared data as a\nreliable tracer of star formation activity in the AGN host galaxies, we find\nthat AGN with pronounced radio jets exhibit a much higher star formation rate\nthan the purely X-ray selected ones, even at the same X-ray luminosities. This\ndifference implies that positive AGN feedback plays an important role, too, and\ntherefore has to be accounted for in all future simulation work. We interpret\nthis to indicate that the enhanced star formation rate of radio selected AGN\narises because of jet-induced star formation, as is hinted by the different jet\npowers among our AGN samples, while the suppressed star formation rate of X-ray\nselected AGN is caused by heating and photo-dissociation of molecular gas by\nthe hot AGN accretion disc.\n", "  We report recent results on the impact of asymmetric dark matter (DM)\nparticles on low-mass stars. First, we found that the small convective core\nexpected in stars with masses between 1.1 and 1.3 Msun is suppressed due to DM\ncooling. Moreover, stars with masses below 1 Msun have their central\ntemperatures and densities more strongly influenced by DM than in the solar\ncase. We were able to put limits to the DM mass and spin-dependent DM-proton\nscattering cross section by comparing the modelling of the nearby star Alpha\nCen B with photometric, spectroscopic and asteroseismic observations.\n", "  The combination of multiple cosmological probes can produce measurements of\ncosmological parameters much more stringent than those possible with any\nindividual probe. We examine the combination of two highly correlated probes of\nlate-time structure growth: (i) weak gravitational lensing from a survey with\nphotometric redshifts and (ii) galaxy clustering and redshift space distortions\nfrom a survey with spectroscopic redshifts. We choose generic survey designs so\nthat our results are applicable to a range of current and future photometric\nredshift (e.g. KiDS, DES, HSC, Euclid) and spectroscopic redshift (e.g. DESI,\n4MOST, Sumire) surveys. Combining the surveys greatly improves their power to\nmeasure both dark energy and modified gravity. An independent, non-overlapping\ncombination sees a dark energy figure of merit more than 4 times larger than\nthat produced by either survey alone. The powerful synergies between the\nsurveys are strongest for modified gravity, where their constraints are\northogonal, producing a non-overlapping joint figure of merit nearly 2 orders\nof magnitude larger than either alone. Our projected angular power spectrum\nformalism makes it easy to model the cross-correlation observable when the\nsurveys overlap on the sky, producing a joint data vector and full covariance\nmatrix. We calculate a same-sky improvement factor, from the inclusion of these\ncross-correlations, relative to non-overlapping surveys. We find nearly a\nfactor of 4 for dark energy and more than a factor of 2 for modified gravity.\nThe exact forecast figures of merit and same-sky benefits can be radically\naffected by a range of forecasts assumption, which we explore methodically in a\nsensitivity analysis. We show that that our fiducial assumptions produce robust\nresults which give a good average picture of the science return from combining\nphotometric and spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmological parameters, but its\npotential can be fully utilised only if galaxy shapes are measured with great\naccuracy. Two major effects have been identified which are likely to account\nfor most of the bias for maximum likelihood methods in recent shear measurement\nchallenges. Model bias occurs when the true galaxy shape is not well\nrepresented by the fitted model. Noise bias occurs due to the non-linear\nrelationship between image pixels and galaxy shape. In this paper we\ninvestigate the potential interplay between these two effects when an imperfect\nmodel is used in the presence of high noise. We present analytical expressions\nfor this bias, which depends on the residual difference between the model and\nreal data. They can lead to biases not accounted for in previous calibration\nschemes. By measuring the model bias, noise bias and their interaction, we\nprovide a complete statistical framework for measuring galaxy shapes with model\nfitting methods from GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT) like\nimages. We demonstrate the noise and model interaction bias using a simple toy\nmodel, which indicates that this effect can potentially be significant. Using\nreal galaxy images from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) we quantify\nthe strength of the model bias, noise bias and their interaction. We find that\nthe interaction term is often a similar size to the model bias term, and is\nsmaller than the requirements of the current and shortly upcoming galaxy\nsurveys.\n", "  We propose a multi-field extension of (generalized) G-inflation, based on\ncovariant multi-galileons and their generalization preserving second-order\nfield equations. We compute the quadratic action for cosmological\nperturbations. By comparing the formulas for cosmological perturbations, it is\nhighlighted that multi-field DBI galileon inflation is not included in the\nmulti-field version of generalized G-inflation. Our result indicates that the\ngeneralized covariant multi-galileon theory is not the most general\nmulti-scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations.\n", "  There is evidence of triggering of tremor by seismic waves emanating from\ndistant large earthquakes. The frequency contents of triggered and ambient\ntremor are largely identical, suggesting that tremor does not depend directly\non the nature of the source. We show here that the model of plate dynamics\ndeveloped earlier by us is an appropriate tool for describing the onset of\ntremor. In the framework of this model, tremor is an internal response of a\nfault to a failure triggered by external disturbances. The model predicts\ngeneration of radiation in a frequency range defined by the fault parameters.\nOther specific features predicted are: the upper limit of the size of the\nemitting area is a few dozen km; tremor accompanies earthquakes and aseismic\nslip; the frequency content of tremor depends on the type of failure. The model\nalso explains why a tremor has no clear impulsive phase, in contrast to\nearthquakes. A comparatively small effective normal stress (hence a high fluid\npressure) is required to make the model consistent with observed tremor\nparameters. Our model indicates that tremor is not necessarily a superposition\nof low frequency earthquakes, as commonly assumed, although the latter may\ntrigger them. The approach developed complements the conventional viewpoint\nwhich assumes that tremor reflects a frictional process with low rupture speed.\nEssentially our model adds the hypothesis that resonant-type oscillations exist\ninside a fault. This addition may change our understanding of the nature of\ntremor in general, and the methods of its identification and location in\nparticular.\n", "  We test the ability of equilibrium galactic disk and one-zone interstellar\nmedium models to describe the physical and emission properties of quasar hosts,\nsubmillimeter galaxies, and Lyman-alpha emitters at z>~6. The size, line\nwidths, star formation rates, black hole accretion rates, gas masses and\ntemperatures, and the relationships between these properties are all\nwell-described by our model, and we provide approximate fitting formulae for\ncomparison with future observations. However, comparing our carbon line\npredictions to observations reveals differences between the ISM at low and high\nredshifts. Our underestimate of the [CII] line emission indicates either higher\nstar formation efficiencies in high-redshift molecular clouds or less depletion\nof metals into dust at fixed metallicity. Further, our over-prediction of the\nCO(6-5)/CO(1-0) ratio suggests that molecular clouds in real high-redshift\ngalaxies have a lower turbulent Mach number and more subthermal CO(6-5)\nemission than expected owing either to sizes smaller than the local Jeans mass\nor to a pressure support mechanism other than turbulence.\n", "  A transient Mie-like solution for acoustic scattering from a spherical object\nis derived within a mesh-free and singularity-free Time Domain Integral\nEquation (TDIE) framework for the sound-soft, sound-rigid and penetrable cases.\nThe method is based on an expansion of the time domain Green's function that\nallows independent evaluation of spatial and temporal convolutions. Solution of\nthe TDIE system may be effected by descretizing the integral equations in space\nand time, forming a matrix system via the Method of Moments, and solving the\nsystem with the Marching on in Time algorithm. Spatial discretization using\ntesseral harmonics leads to closed form expressions for spatial integrals, and\nuse of a strictly band limited temporal interpolant permits efficient, accurate\ncomputation of temporal convolutions utilizing numerical quadrature. The\naccuracy of these integrations ensures late time stability and accuracy of the\ndeconvolution data. Results presented demonstrate the accuracy and convergence\nof the approach for broadband simulations against Fourier transformed\nanalytical data.\n", "  Following the recently established \"Binary-driven HyperNova\" (BdHN) paradigm,\nwe here interpret GRB 970828 in terms of the four episodes typical of such a\nmodel. The \"Episode 1\", up to 40 s after the trigger time t_0, with a time\nvarying thermal emission and a total energy of E_{iso,1st} = 2.60 x 10^{53}\nerg, is interpreted as due to the onset of an hyper-critical accretion process\nonto a companion neutron star, triggered by the companion star, an FeCO core\napproaching a SN explosion. The \"Episode 2\", observed up t_0+90 s, is\ninterpreted as a canonical gamma ray burst, with an energy of E^{e^+e^-}_{tot}\n= 1.60 x 10^{53} erg, a baryon load of B = 7 x 10^{-3} and a bulk Lorentz\nfactor at transparency of \\Gamma = 142.5. From this Episode 2, we infer that\nthe GRB exploded in an environment with a large average particle density <n>\n\\approx 10^3 particles/cm^3 and dense clouds characterized by typical\ndimensions of (4 \\div 8) x 10^{14} cm and \\delta n / n ~ 10. The \"Episode 3\" is\nidentified from t_0+90 s all the way up to 10^{5-6} s: despite the paucity of\nthe early X-ray data, typical in the BATSE, pre-Swift era, we find extremely\nsignificant data points in the late X-ray afterglow emission of GRB 970828,\nwhich corresponds to the ones observed in all BdHNe sources. The \"Episode 4\",\nrelated to the Supernova emission, does not appear to be observable in this\nsource, due to the presence of darkening from the large density of the GRB\nenvironment, also inferred from the analysis of the Episode 2.\n", "  Surveys with submillimetre telescopes are revealing large numbers of\ngravitationally lensed high-redshift sources. I describe how, in practice,\nthese lensed systems could be simultaneously used to estimate the values of\ncosmological parameters, test models for the evolution of the distribution of\ndark-matter halos and investigate the properties of the source population. Even\nthe existing sample of lenses found with the Hershcel Space Observatory is\nenough to formally rule out the standard models of the evolving population of\ndark-matter halos, with the likely explanation a combination of baryon physics\nand the perturbation by infalling baryons of the density distribution of dark\nmatter at the centres of the halos. Independently of the evolution of the\nhalos, observations of a sample of 100 lensed systems would be enough to\nestimate Omega_Lambda with a precision of 5% and observations of 1000 lenses\nwould be enough to estimate w, the parameter in the equation-of-state of dark\nenergy, with a precision similar to that obtained from the Planck observations\nof the cosmic microwave background. While the fraction of submillimetre sources\nthat are lensed depends weakly on the specific halo mass function that is used\nin the model, it depends very strongly on the evolution of the submillimetre\nluminosity function of the source population. Therefore measurements of the\nlensing fraction could be used to investigate galaxy evolution in a way that is\nindependent of the properties of the intervening halos.\n", "  Asymmetric beams can create significant bias in estimates of the power\nspectra from CMB experiments. With the temperature power spectrum many orders\nof magnitude stronger than the B-mode power spectrum any systematic error that\ncouples the two must be carefully controlled and/or removed. Here, we derive\nunbiased estimators for the CMB temperature and polarisation power spectra\ntaking into account general beams and general scan strategies. A simple\nconsequence of asymmetric beams is that, even with an ideal scan strategy where\nevery sky pixel is seen at every orientation, there will be residual coupling\nfrom temperature power to B-mode power if the orientation of the beam asymmetry\nis not aligned with the orientation of the co-polarisation. We test our\ncorrection algorithm on simulations of two temperature-only experiments and\ndemonstrate that it is unbiased. The simulated experiments use realistic scan\nstrategies, noise levels and highly asymmetric beams. We also develop a\nmap-making algorithm that is capable of removing beam asymmetry bias at the map\nlevel. We demonstrate its implementation using simulations and show that it is\ncapable of accurately correcting both temperature and polarisation maps for all\nof the effects of beam asymmetry including the effects of temperature to\npolarisation leakage.\n", "  We construct explicit string theory models realizing the recently proposed\n\"St\\\"uckelberg Portal\" scenario, a framework for building Z' mediation models\nwithout the need to introduce unwanted exotic matter charged under the Standard\nModel. This scenario can be viewed purely field-theoretically, although it is\nparticularly well motivated from string theory. By analyzing carefully the\nSt\\\"uckelberg couplings between the Abelian gauge bosons and the RR axions, we\nconstruct the first global intersecting brane models which extend the Standard\nModel with a genuine hidden sector, to which it is nonetheless connected via\nU(1) mass mixings. Utilizing the explicit models we construct, we discuss some\nbroad phenomenological properties and experimental implications of this\nscenario such as Z-Z' mixings, dark matter stability and relic density, and\nsupersymmetry mediation. With an appropriate confining hidden sector, our setup\nalso provides a minimal realization of the hidden valley scenario. We further\nexplore the possibility of obtaining small Z' masses from a large ensemble of\nU(1) bosons. Related to the St\\\"uckelberg portal are two mechanisms that\nconnect the visible and the hidden sectors, namely mediation by\nnon-perturbative operators and the hidden photon scenario, on which we briefly\ncomment.\n", "  The Cygnus-X star-forming complex is one of the most active regions of low\nand high mass star formation within 2 kpc of the Sun. Using mid-infrared\nphotometry from the IRAC and MIPS Spitzer Cygnus-X Legacy Survey, we have\nidentified over 1800 protostar candidates. We compare the protostellar\nluminosity functions of two regions within Cygnus-X: CygX-South and CygX-North.\nThese two clouds show distinctly different morphologies suggestive of\ndissimilar star-forming environments. We find the luminosity functions of these\ntwo regions are statistically different. Furthermore, we compare the luminosity\nfunctions of protostars found in regions of high and low stellar density within\nCygnus-X and find that the luminosity function in regions of high stellar\ndensity is biased to higher luminosities. In total, these observations provide\nfurther evidence that the luminosities of protostars depend on their natal\nenvironment. We discuss the implications this dependence has for the star\nformation process.\n", "  We investigate the physical properties of molecular hydrogen (H2) in isolated\nand interacting disk galaxies with different masses and Hubble types by using\nchemodynamical simulations with H2 formation on dust grains and dust growth and\ndestruction in interstellar medium (ISM). We particularly focus on the\ndependences of H2 gas mass fractions (f_H2), spatial distributions of HI and\nH2, and local H2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (M_h), baryonic\nfractions (f_bary), gas mass fractions (f_g), and Hubble types. The principal\nresults are as follows. The final f_H2 can be larger in disk galaxies with\nhigher M_h, f_bary, and f_g. Some low-mass disk models with M_h smaller than\n10^10 M_sun show extremely low f_H2 and thus no/little star formation, even if\ninitial f_g is quite large (>0.9). Big galactic bulges can severely suppress\nthe formation of H2 from HI on dust grains whereas strong stellar bars can not\nonly enhance f_H2 but also be responsible for the formation of H2-dominated\ncentral rings. The projected radial distributions of H2 are significantly more\ncompact than those of HI and the simulated radial profiles of H2-to-HI-ratios\n(R_mol) follow roughly R^-1.5 in MW-type disk models. Galaxy interaction can\nsignificantly increase f_H2 and total H2 mass in disk galaxies. The local\nsurface mass densities of H2 can be correlated with those of dust in a galaxy.\nThe observed correlation between R_mol and gas pressure (R_mol ~ P_g^0.92) can\nbe well reproduced in the simulated disk galaxies.\n", "  We introduce and study new invariants associated with Laplace type elliptic\npartial differential operators on manifolds. These invariants are constructed\nby using the off-diagonal heat kernel; they are not pure spectral invariants,\nthat is, they depend not only on the eigenvalues but also on the corresponding\neigenfunctions in a non-trivial way. We compute the first three low-order\ninvariants explicitly.\n", "  Filaments of the cosmic web drive spin acquisition of disc galaxies. The\npoint process of filament-type saddle represent best this environment and can\nbe used to revisit the Tidal Torque Theory in the context of an anisotropic\npeak (saddle) background split. The constrained misalignment between the tidal\ntensor and the Hessian of the density field generated in the vicinity of\nfilament saddle points simply explains the corresponding transverse and\nlongitudinal point-reflection symmetric geometry of spin distribution. It\npredicts in particular an azimuthal orientation of the spins of more massive\ngalaxies and spin alignment with the filament for less massive galaxies. Its\nscale dependence also allows us to relate the transition mass corresponding to\nthe alignment of dark matter halos spin relative to the direction of their\nneighboring filament to this geometry, and to predict accordingly it s scaling\nwith the mass of non linearity, as was measured in simulations.\n", "  Warm inflation in the non minimal derivative coupling model with a general\ndissipation coefficient is considered. We investigate conditions for the\nexistence of the slow roll approximation and study cosmological perturbations.\nThe spectral index, and the power spectrum are calculated and the temperature\nof the universe at the end of the slow roll warm inflation is obtained.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of the Kepler M dwarf planet hosts, with a\nparticular focus on the fractional number of systems hosting multiple\ntransiting planets. We manufacture synthetic planetary systems within a range\nof planet multiplicity and mutual inclination for comparison to the Kepler\nyield. We recover the observed number of systems containing between 2 and 5\ntransiting planets if every M dwarf hosts 6.1+/-1.9 planets with typical mutual\ninclinations of 2.0 +4.0-2.0 degrees. This range includes the Solar System in\nits coplanarity and multiplicity. However, similar to studies of Kepler\nexoplanetary systems around more massive stars, we report that the number of\nsingly-transiting planets found by Kepler is too high to be consistent with a\nsingle population of multi-planet systems: a finding that cannot be attributed\nto selection biases. To account for the excess singleton planetary systems we\nadopt a mixture model and find that 55 +23-12% of planetary systems are either\nsingle or contain multiple planets with large mutual inclinations. Thus, we\nfind that the so-called \"Kepler dichotomy\" holds for planets orbiting M dwarfs\nas well as Sun-like stars. Additionally, we compare stellar properties of the\nhosts to single and multiple transiting planets. For the brightest subset of\nstars in our sample we find intriguing, yet marginally significant evidence\nthat stars hosting multiply-transiting systems are rotating more quickly, are\ncloser to the midplane of the Milky Way, and are comparatively metal poor. This\npreliminary finding warrants further investigation.\n", "  Stellar magnetic activity is an important factor in the formation and\nevolution of exoplanets. Magnetic phenomena like stellar flares, coronal mass\nejections, and high-energy emission affect the exoplanetary atmosphere and its\nmass loss over time. One major question is whether the magnetic evolution of\nexoplanet host stars is the same as for stars without planets; tidal and\nmagnetic interactions of a star and its close-in planets may play a role in\nthis. Stellar magnetic activity also shapes our ability to detect exoplanets\nwith different methods in the first place, and therefore we need to understand\nit properly to derive an accurate estimate of the existing exoplanet\npopulation. Here I review recent theoretical and observational results, as well\nas outline some avenues for future progress.\n", "  We introduce new Fourier band-power estimators for cosmic shear data analysis\nand E/B-mode separation. We consider both the case where one performs E/B-mode\nseparation and the case where one does not. The resulting estimators have\nseveral nice properties which make them ideal for cosmic shear data analysis.\nFirst, they can be written as linear combinations of the binned cosmic shear\ncorrelation functions. Second, they account for the survey window function in\nreal-space. Third, they are unbiased by shape noise since they do not use\ncorrelation function data at zero separation. Fourth, the band-power window\nfunctions in Fourier space are compact and largely non-oscillatory. Fifth, they\ncan be used to construct band-power estimators with very efficient data\ncompression properties. In particular, we find that all of the information on\nthe parameters $\\Omega_{m}$, $\\sigma_{8}$ and $n_{s}$ in the shear correlation\nfunctions in the range of $\\sim10-400$ arcminutes for single tomographic bin\ncan be compressed into only three band-power estimates. Finally, we can achieve\nthese rates of data compression while excluding small-scale information where\nthe modeling of the shear correlation functions and power spectra is very\ndifficult. Given these desirable properties, these estimators will be very\nuseful for cosmic shear data analysis.\n", "  Starting out with an entropy identity, the entropy flux, the entropy\nproduction and the corresponding Gibbs and Gibbs-Duhem equations of\ngeneral-covariant conti\\-nuum thermodynamics are established. Non-dissipative\nmaterials and equilibria are investigated. It is proved that equilibrium\nconditions only put on material properties cannot generate equilibria, rather\nadditionally, the Killing property of the 4-temperature is a necessary\ncondition for space-times in which equilibria are possible.\n", "  We report on measurements and modeling of the mode structure of tunable\nFabry-P\\'erot optical microcavities with imperfect mirrors. We find that\nnon-spherical mirror shape and finite mirror size lead to loss, mode\ndeformation, and shifted resonance frequencies at particular mirror\nseparations. For small mirror diameters, the useful cavity length is limited to\nvalues significantly below the expected stability range. We explain the\nobservations by resonant coupling between different transverse modes of the\ncavity and mode-dependent diffraction loss. A model based on resonant state\nexpansion that takes into account the measured mirror profile can reproduce the\nmeasurements and identify the parameter regime where detrimental effects of\nmode mixing are avoided.\n", "  G.Parisi predicted an important variational formula for the thermodynamic\nlimit of the intensive free energy for a class of mean field spin glasses. In\nthis paper, we present an elementary approach to the study of the Parisi\nfunctional using stochastic dynamic programing and semi-linear PDE. We give a\nderivation of important properties of the Parisi PDE avoiding the use of Ruelle\nProbability Cascades and Cole-Hopf transformations. As an application, we give\na simple proof of the strict convexity of the Parisi functional, which was\nrecently proved by Auffinger and Chen in [2].\n", "  We examine the interference \\gamma Z box corrections to parity-violating\nelastic electron--proton scattering in the light of the recent observation of\nquark-hadron duality in parity-violating deep-inelastic scattering from the\ndeuteron, and the approximate isospin independence of duality in the\nelectromagnetic nucleon structure functions down to Q^2 \\approx 1 GeV^2.\nAssuming that a similar behavior also holds for the \\gamma Z proton structure\nfunctions, we find that duality constrains the \\gamma Z box correction to the\nproton's weak charge to be \\Re e\\, \\square_{\\gamma Z}^V = (5.4 \\pm 0.4) \\times\n10^{-3} at the kinematics of the Q_{\\text{weak}} experiment. Within the same\nmodel we also provide estimates of the \\gamma Z corrections for future\nparity-violating experiments, such as MOLLER at Jefferson Lab and MESA at\nMainz.\n", "  Although Nose's thermostated mechanics is formally consistent with Gibbs'\ncanonical ensemble, the thermostated Nose-Hoover ( harmonic ) oscillator, with\nits mean kinetic temperature controlled, is far from ergodic. Much of its phase\nspace is occupied by regular conservative tori. Oscillator ergodicity has\npreviously been achieved by controlling two oscillator moments with two\nthermostat variables. Here we use computerized searches in conjunction with\nvisualization to find singly-thermostated motion equations for the oscillator\nwhich are consistent with Gibbs' canonical distribution. These models are the\nsimplest able to bridge the gap between Gibbs' statistical ensembles and\nNewtonian single-particle dynamics.\n", "  Fr\\\"{o}hlich's polaron Hamiltonian describes an electron coupled to the\nquantized phonon field of an ionic crystal. We show that in the strong coupling\nlimit the dynamics of the polaron is approximated by an effective non-linear\npartial differential equation due to Landau and Pekar, in which the phonon\nfield is treated as a classical field.\n", "  The quest for high-efficiency heat-to-electricity conversion has been one of\nthe major driving forces towards renewable energy production for the future.\nEfficient thermoelectric devices require high voltage generation from a\ntemperature gradient and a large electrical conductivity, while maintaining a\nlow thermal conductivity. For a given thermal conductivity and temperature, the\nthermoelectric powerfactor is determined by the electronic structure of the\nmaterial. Low dimensionality (1D and 2D) opens new routes to high powerfactor\ndue to the unique density of states (DOS) of confined electrons and holes. 2D\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent a new class of\nthermoelectric materials not only due to such confinement effects, but\nespecially due to their large effective masses and valley degeneracies. Here we\nreport a powerfactor of $MoS_2$ as large as $8.5 mWm^{-1}K^{-2}$ at room\ntemperature, which is amongst the highest measured in traditional, gapped\nthermoelectric materials. To obtain these high powerfactors, we perform\nthermoelectric measurements on few-layer $MoS_2$ in the metallic regime, which\nallows us to access the 2D DOS near the conduction band edge and exploit the\neffect of 2D confinement on electron scattering rates, which result in a large\nSeebeck coefficient. The demonstrated high, electronically modulated\npowerfactor in 2D TMDCs holds promise for efficient thermoelectric energy\nconversion.\n", "  We present an efficient method of imaging 3D nanoscale lattice behavior and\nstrain fields in crystalline materials with a new methodology -- three\ndimensional Bragg projection ptychography (3DBPP). In this method, the 2D\nsample structure information encoded in a coherent high-angle Bragg peak\nmeasured at a fixed angle is combined with the real-space scanning probe\npositions to reconstruct the 3D sample structure. This work introduces an\nentirely new means of three dimensional structural imaging of nanoscale\nmaterials and eliminates the experimental complexities associated with rotating\nnanoscale samples. We present the framework for the method and demonstrate our\napproach with a numerical demonstration, an analytical derivation, and an\nexperimental reconstruction of lattice distortions in a component of a\nnanoelectronic prototype device.\n", "  We present the mass-density relationship (log M - log rho) for objects with\nmasses ranging from planets (M ~ 0.01 M_Jup) through stars (M > 0.08 M_Sun).\nThis relationship shows three distinct regions separated by a change in slope\nin log M -- log rho plane. In particular, objects with masses in the range 0.3\nM_Jup to 60 M_Jup follow a tight linear relationship with no distinguishing\nfeature to separate the low mass end (giant planets) from the high mass end\n(brown dwarfs). The distinction between giant planets and brown dwarfs thus\nseems arbitrary. We propose a new definition of giant planets based simply on\nchanges in the slope of the log $M$ versus log rho relationship. By this\ncriterion, objects with masses less than ~ 0.3 M_Jup are low mass planets,\neither icy or rocky. Giant planets cover the mass range 0.3 M_Jup to 60 M_Jup.\nAnalogous to the stellar main sequence, objects on the upper end of the giant\nplanet sequence (brown dwarfs) can simply be referred to as \"high mass giant\nplanets\", while planets with masses near that of Jupiter can be considered to\nbe \"low mass giant planets\".\n", "  Random unitary matrices find a number of applications in quantum information\nscience, and are central to the recently defined boson sampling algorithm for\nphotons in linear optics. We describe an operationally simple method to\ndirectly implement Haar random unitary matrices in optical circuits, with no\nrequirement for prior or explicit matrix calculations. Our physically-motivated\nand compact representation directly maps independent probability density\nfunctions for parameters in Haar random unitary matrices, to optical circuit\ncomponents. We go on to extend the results to the case of random unitaries for\nqubits.\n", "  Following the original idea of Debye, we define and extract a gauge-invariant\nscreening mass from the complex static in-medium heavy-quark potential\n$V_{Q\\bar{Q}}$, recently obtained from lattice QCD. To this end we derive a\nfield theoretically motivated analytic formula that faithfully reproduces both\nthe screened real- as well as the imaginary part of the lattice potential with\na single temperature dependent fit parameter $m_D(T)$. Using values of the real\npart of $V_{Q\\bar{Q}}$ in a gluonic medium, we obtain Debye masses compatible\nwith predictions from HTL perturbation theory.\n", "  The dwarf planet Pluto is known to host an extended system of five co-planar\nsatellites. Previous studies have explored the formation and evolution of the\nsystem in isolation, neglecting perturbative effects by the Sun. Here we show\nthat secular evolution due to the Sun can strongly affect the evolution of\nouter satellites and rings in the system, if such exist. Although precession\ndue to extended gravitational potential from the inner Pluto-Charon binary\nquench such secular evolution up to $a_{crit}\\sim0.0035$ AU ($\\sim0.09$\n$R_{Hill}$ the Hill radius; including all of the currently known satellites),\nouter orbits can be significantly altered. In particular, we find that\n\\emph{co-planar} rings and satellites should not exist beyond $a_{crit}$;\nrather, satellites and dust particles in these regions secularly evolve on\ntimescales ranging between $10^{4}-10^{6}$ yrs, and quasi-periodically change\ntheir inclinations and eccentricities through secular evolution (Lidov-Kozai\noscillations). Such oscillations can lead to high inclinations and\neccentricities, constraining the range where such satellites (and dust\nparticles) can exist without crossing the orbits of the inner satellites, or\ncrossing the outer Hill stability range. Outer satellites, if such exist are\ntherefore likely to be \\emph{irregular} satellites, with orbits limited to be\nnon-circular and/or highly inclined. These could be potentially detected and\nprobed by the New-Horizon mission, possibly providing direct evidence for the\nsecular evolution of the Pluto satellite system, and shedding new light on its\norigins.\n", "  We study a two filament driven lattice gas model with oppositely directed\nspecies of particles moving on two parallel filaments with filament switching\nprocesses and particle inflow and outflow at filament ends. The filament\nswitching process is {\\it correlated} such that particles switch filaments with\nfinite probability only when oppositely directed particles meet on the same\nfilament. This model mimics some of the coarse grained features observed in\ncontext of microtubule (MT) based intracellular transport, wherein cellular\ncargo loaded and off-loaded at filament ends are transported on multiple\nparallel microtubule (MT) filaments and can switch between the parallel\nmicrotubule filaments. We focus on a regime where the filaments are weakly\ncoupled, such that filament switching rates scale inversely as the length of\nthe filament. We find that the interplay (off)loading processes at the\nboundaries and the filament switching process leads to some distinctive\nfeatures of the system. These features includes occurrence of variety of phases\nin the system with inhomogeneous density profiles including localized density\nshocks, density difference across the filaments and bidirectional current flows\nin the system. We analyze the system by developing a mean field (MF) theory and\ncomparing the results obtained from the MF theory with the Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations of the dynamics of the system. We find that the steady state\ndensity and current profiles of particles and the phase diagram obtained within\nthe MF picture matches quite well with MC simulation results. These findings\nmaybe useful for studying multi-filament intracellular transport.\n", "  Diffusion in colloidal suspensions can be very slow due to the cage effect,\nwhich confines each particle within a short radius on one hand, and involves\nlarge-scale cooperative motions on the other. In search of insight into this\ncooperativity, here the authors develop a formalism to calculate the\ndisplacement correlation in colloidal systems, mainly in the two-dimensional\ncase. To clarify the idea for it, studies are reviewed on cooperativity among\nthe particles in the one-dimensional case, i.e. the single-file diffusion\n(SFD). As an improvement over the celebrated formula by Alexander and Pincus on\nthe mean-square displacement (MSD) in SFD, it is shown that the displacement\ncorrelation in SFD can be calculated from Lagrangian correlation of the\nparticle interval in the one-dimensional case, and also that the formula can be\nextended to higher dimensions. The improved formula becomes exact for large\nsystems. By combining the formula with a nonlinear theory for correlation, a\ncorrection to the asymptotic law for the MSD in SFD is obtained. In the\ntwo-dimensional case, the linear theory gives description of vortical\ncooperative motion.\n", "  We elaborate on the color-kinematics duality for off-shell diagrams in gauge\ntheories coupled to matter, by investigating the scattering process $gg\\to ss,\nq\\bar q, gg$, and show that the Jacobi relations for the kinematic numerators\nof off-shell diagrams, built with Feynman rules in axial gauge, reduce to a\ncolor-kinematics violating term due to the contributions of sub-graphs only.\nSuch anomaly vanishes when the four particles connected by the Jacobi relation\nare on their mass shell with vanishing squared momenta, being either external\nor cut particles, where the validity of the color-kinematics duality is\nrecovered. We discuss the role of the off-shell decomposition in the direct\nconstruction of higher-multiplicity numerators satisfying color-kinematics\nidentity in four as well as in $d$ dimensions, for the latter employing the\nFour Dimensional Formalism variant of the Four Dimensional Helicity scheme. We\nprovide explicit examples for the QCD process $gg\\to q\\bar{q}g$.\n", "  We analyze the Casimir interaction of doped graphene. To this end we derive a\nsimple expression for the finite temperature polarization tensor with a\nchemical potential. It is found that doping leads to a strong enhancement of\nthe Casimir force reaching almost $60\\%$ in quite realistic situations. This\nresult should be important for planning and interpreting the Casimir\nmeasurements, especially taking into account that the Casimir interaction of\nundoped graphene is rather weak.\n", "  Recently synthesized 3D materials with Dirac spectrum exhibit peculiar\nelectric transport qualitatively different from its 2D analogue, graphene.\nNeglecting impuritiy scattering, the real part of the conductivity is strongly\nfrequency dependent (linear), while the imaginary part is non-zero (unlike in\nundoped, clean graphene). The Coulomb interaction between electrons is\nunscreened as in a dielectric and hence is long range. We demonstrate that the\ninteraction correction renders the electrodynamics nonlocal on a mesoscopic\\\nscale. The longitudinal conductivity $\\sigma _{L}$ (related by charge\nconservation to the electric susceptibility) and the transverse conductivity\n$\\sigma _{T}$ are different in the long wave length limit and consequently the\nstandard local Ohm's law description does not apply. This leads to several\nremarkable effects in transport and optical response. We predict a charging\neffect in DC transport that is a direct signature of the nonlocality. The\noptical response of the WSM is also sensitive to the nonlocality. In these\nmaterials p-polarized light generates bulk plasmons as well as the transversal\nwaves. The propagation inside the WSM is only slightly attenuated. At a\nspecific (material parameter dependent) frequency the two modes coincide, a\nphenomenon impossible in a local medium. Remarkably, for any frequency there is\nan incident angle where total absorption occurs, turning the WSM opaque.\n", "  The compliance matrix for a general anisotropic material is usually expressed\nin an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system, which brings some confusion or\ninconvenience in identifying independent elastic material constants and\ncomparing elastic properties between different materials. In this paper, a\nunique stiffest orientation based standardized (STF-OS) compliance matrix is\nestablished, and 18 independent elastic material constants are clearly shown.\nDuring the searching process for stiffest orientation, it is interesting to\nfind from our theoretical analysis and an example that a material with\nisotropic tensile stiffness does not definitely possess isotropic elasticity.\nTherefore the ratio between the maximum and minimum tensile stiffnesses is not\na correct measure of anisotropy degree. Alternatively, a simple and correct\nmeasure of anisotropy degree based on the maximum shear-extension coupling\ncoefficient in all orientations is proposed.\n", "  We present results on the renormalization functions of the quark field and\nfermion bilinears with up to one covariant derivative. For the fermion part of\nthe action we employ the twisted mass formulation with $N_f{=}2$ and $N_f{=}4$\ndegenerate dynamical quarks, while in the gluon sector we use the Iwasaki\nimproved action. The simulations for $N_f{=}4$ have been performed for pion\nmasses in the range of 390MeV - 760MeV and at three values of the lattice\nspacing, $a$, corresponding to $\\beta{=}1.90,\\,1.95,\\,2.10$. The $N_f{=}2$\naction includes a clover term with $c_{\\rm sw}{=}1.57551$ at $\\beta{=}2.10$,\nand three ensembles at different values of $m_\\pi$.\n  The evaluation of the renormalization functions is carried out in the RI$'$\nscheme using a momentum source. The non-perturbartive evaluation is\ncomplemented with a perturbative computation, which is carried out at one-loop\nlevel and to all orders in the lattice spacing, $a$. For each renormalization\nfunction computed non-perturbatively we subtract the corresponding lattice\nartifacts to all orders in $a$, so that a large part of the cut-off effects is\neliminated.\n  The renormalization functions are converted to the ${\\overline{\\rm MS}}$\nscheme at a reference energy scale of $\\mu{=}2$ GeV after taking the chiral\nlimit.\n", "  We extract the leading-order entropy of a four-dimensional extremal black\nhole in ${\\cal N}{=}2$ ungauged supergravity by formulating the CFT$_1$ that is\nholographically dual to its near-horizon AdS$_2$ geometry, in terms of a\nrational Calogero model with a known counting formula for the degeneracy of\nstates in its Hilbert space.\n", "  The search for a simple description of fundamental physical processes is an\nimportant part of quantum theory. One example for such an abstraction can be\nfound in the distance lab paradigm: if two separated parties are connected via\na classical channel, it is notoriously difficult to characterize all possible\noperations these parties can perform. This class of operations is widely known\nas local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Surprisingly, the\nsituation becomes comparably simple if the more general class of separable\noperations is considered, a finding which has been extensively used in quantum\ninformation theory for many years. Here, we propose a related approach for the\nresource theory of quantum coherence, where two distant parties can only\nperform measurements which do not create coherence and can communicate their\noutcomes via a classical channel. We call this class local incoherent\noperations and classical communication (LICC). While the characterization of\nthis class is also difficult in general, we show that the larger class of\nseparable incoherent operations (SI) has a simple mathematical form, yet still\npreserving the main features of LICC. We demonstrate the relevance of our\napproach by applying it to three different tasks: assisted coherence\ndistillation, quantum teleportation, and single-shot quantum state merging. We\nexpect that the results obtained in this work also transfer to other concepts\nof coherence which are discussed in recent literature. The approach presented\nhere opens new ways to study the resource theory of coherence in distributed\nscenarios.\n", "  Models of inflation are instructive playgrounds for supersymmetry breaking in\nSupergravity and String Theory. In particular, combinations of branes and\norientifolds that are not mutually BPS can lead to \\emph{brane supersymmetry\nbreaking}, a phenomenon where non--linear realizations are accompanied, in\ntachyon--free vacua, by the emergence of steep exponential potentials. When\ncombined with milder terms, these exponentials can lead to slow--roll after a\nfast ascent and a turning point. This leaves behind distinctive patterns of\nscalar perturbations, where pre--inflationary peaks can lie well apart from an\nalmost scale invariant profile. I review recent attempts to connect these power\nspectra to the low--$\\ell$ CMB, and a corresponding one--parameter extension of\n$\\Lambda$CDM with a low--frequency cut $\\Delta$. A detailed likelihood analysis\nled to $\\Delta = (0.351 \\pm 0.114) \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$, at\n$99.4\\%$ confidence level, in an extended Galactic mask with $f_{sky}=39\\%$, to\nbe compared with a nearby value at $88.5\\%$ in the standard Planck 2015 mask\nwith $f_{sky}=94\\%$. In these scenarios one would be confronted, in the CMB,\nwith relics of an epoch of deceleration that preceded the onset of slow--roll.\n", "  This work presents a Boundary Element Method (BEM) formulation for\ncontactless electromagnetic field assessments. The new scheme is based on a\nregularized BEM approach that requires the use of electric measurements only.\nThe regularization is obtained by leveraging on an extension of Calderon\ntechniques to rectangular systems leading to well-conditioned problems\nindependent of the discretization density. This enables the use of highly\ndiscretized Huygens surfaces that can be consequently placed very near to the\nradiating source. In addition, the new regularized scheme is hybridized with\nboth surfacic homogeneous and volumetric inhomogeneous forward BEM solvers\naccelerated with fast matrix-vector multiplication schemes. This allows for\nrapid and effective dosimetric assessments and permits the use of inhomogeneous\nand realistic head phantoms. Numerical results corroborate the theory and\nconfirms the practical effectiveness of all newly proposed formulations.\n", "  Current predictions for the line ratios from photo-dissociative regions\n(PDRs) in galaxies adopt theoretical models that consider only individual\nparcels of PDR gas each characterized by the local density and far-UV radiation\nfield. However, these quantities are not measured directly from unresolved\ngalaxies, making the connection between theory and observation ambiguous. We\ndevelop a model that uses galaxy-averaged, observable inputs to explain and\npredict measurements of the [CII] fine structure line in luminous and\nultra-luminous infrared galaxies. We find that the [CII] deficit observed in\nthe highest IR surface-brightness systems is a natural consequence of\nsaturating the upper fine-structure transition state at gas temperatures above\n91 K. To reproduce the measured amplitude of the [CII]/FIR ratio in deficit\ngalaxies, we require that [CII] trace approximately 10-17% of all gas in these\nsystems, roughly independent of IR surface brightness and consistent with\nobserved [CII] to CO(1--0) line ratios. Calculating the value of this fraction\nis a challenge for theoretical models. The difficulty may reside in properly\ntreating the topology of molecular and dissociated gas, different descriptions\nfor which may be observationally distinguished by the [OI]63 micron line in\nyet-to-be-probed regions of parameter space, allowing PDR emission lines from\nto probe not only the effects of star formation but also the state and\nconfiguration of interstellar gas.\n", "  Recent photometric and polarimetric observations of type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) show unusually low total-to-selective extinction ratio ($R_{V}<2$) and\nwavelength of maximum polarization ($\\lambda_{max}<0.4\\mu m$) for several SNe\nIa, which indicates peculiar properties of interstellar (IS) dust in the SN\nhosted galaxies and/or the presence of circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper,\nwe use inversion technique to infer best-fit grain size distribution and\nalignment function of interstellar grains along the lines of sight toward four\nSNe Ia with anomalous extinction and polarization data (SNe 1986G, 2006X,\n2008fp, and 2014J). We find that to reproduce low values of $R_{V}$, a\nsignificant enhancement in the mass of small grains of radius $a< 0.1\\mu m$ is\nrequired. For SN 2014J, a simultaneous fit to observed extinction and\npolarization data is unsuccessful if the entire data is attributed to IS dust\n(model 1), but a good fit is obtained when accounting for the contribution of\nCS dust (model 2). For SN 2008fp, our fitting results for model 1 show that, to\nreproduce an extreme value of $\\lambda_{\\max}\\sim 0.15\\mu m$, very small\nsilicate grains must be aligned as efficiently as big grains. We suggest that\ntiny grains in the intervening molecular cloud can be aligned efficiently by\nradiative torques (RATs) from the SNe Ia. The resulting time dependence\npolarization from this RAT alignment model can be tested by observing at\nultraviolet wavelengths. Our results are in favor of the existence of CS dust\nin SN 2014J, but its presence in SN 2008fp remains uncertain.\n", "  The black hole binary GS 2023+338 exhibited an unprecedently bright outburst\non June 2015. Since June 17th, the high energy instruments on board INTEGRAL\ndetected an extremely variable emission during both bright and low luminosity\nphases, with dramatic variations of the hardness ratio on time scales of\n~seconds. The analysis of the IBIS and SPI data reveals the presence of hard\nspectra in the brightest phases, compatible with thermal Comptonization with\ntemperature kTe ~ 40 keV. The seed photons temperature is best fit by kT0 ~ 7\nkeV, that is too high to be compatible with blackbody emission from the disk.\nThis result is consistent with the seed photons being provided by a different\nsource, that we hypothesize to be a synchrotron driven component in the jet.\nDuring the brightest phase of flares, the hardness shows a complex pattern of\ncorrelation with flux, with a maximum energy released in the range 40-100 keV.\nThe hard X-ray variability for E > 50 keV is correlated with flux variations in\nthe softer band, showing that the overall source variability cannot originate\nentirely from absorption, but at least part of it is due to the central\naccreting source.\n", "  We present a beyond mean-field study of clusters and molecular structures in\nlow-spin states of $^{20}$Ne with a multireference relativistic energy density\nfunctional, where the dynamical correlation effects of symmetry restoration and\nquadrupole-octupole shapes fluctuation are taken into account with projections\non parity, particle number and angular momentum in the framework of the\ngenerator coordinate method. Both the energy spectrum and the electric\nmultipole transition strengths for low-lying parity-doublet bands are better\nreproduced after taking into account the dynamical octupole vibration effect.\nConsistent with the finding in previous studies, a rotation-induced dissolution\nof the $\\alpha+^{16}$O molecular structure in $^{20}$Ne is predicted.\n", "  An extended, spinless Falicov-Kimball model in the presence of perpendicular\nmagnetic field is investigated employing Hartree-Fock self-consistent\nmean-field theory in two dimensions. In the presence of an orbital field the\nhybridization-dependence of the excitonic average ${ \\Delta =<{{d_i}^\\dagger}\n{f_i}>}$ is modified. The exciton responses in subtle different ways for\ndifferent chosen values of the magnetic flux consistent with Hofstadter's\nwell-known spectrum. The excitonic average is suppressed by the application of\nmagnetic field. We further examine the effect of Coulomb interaction and\n$f$-electron hopping on the condensation of exciton for some rational values of\nthe applied magnetic field. The interband Coulomb interaction enhances the\n$\\Delta$ exponentially, while a non-zero $f$-electron hopping reduces it. A\nstrong commensurability effect of the magnetic flux on the behaviour of the\nexcitons is observed.\n", "  Quantum computers, that may become available one day, would impact many\nscientific fields, most notably cryptography since many asymmetric primitives\nare insecure against an adversary with quantum capabilities. Cryptographers are\nalready anticipating this threat by proposing and studying a number of\npotentially quantum-safe alternatives for those primitives. On the other hand,\nsymmetric primitives seem less vulnerable against quantum computing: the main\nknown applicable result is Grover's algorithm that gives a quadratic speed-up\nfor exhaustive search.\n  In this work, we examine more closely the security of symmetric ciphers\nagainst quantum attacks. Since our trust in symmetric ciphers relies mostly on\ntheir ability to resist cryptanalysis techniques, we investigate quantum\ncryptanalysis techniques. More specifically, we consider quantum versions of\ndifferential and linear cryptanalysis. We show that it is usually possible to\nuse quantum computations to obtain a quadratic speed-up for these attack\ntechniques, but the situation must be nuanced: we don't get a quadratic\nspeed-up for all variants of the attacks. This allows us to demonstrate the\nfollowing non-intuitive result: the best attack in the classical world does not\nnecessarily lead to the best quantum one. We give some examples of application\non ciphers LAC and KLEIN. We also discuss the important difference between an\nadversary that can only perform quantum computations, and an adversary that can\nalso make quantum queries to a keyed primitive.\n", "  Using astrometric observations spanning more than a century and including a\nlarge set of Cassini data, we determine Saturn's tidal parameters through their\ncurrent effects on the orbits of the eight main and four coorbital moons. We\nhave used the latter to make the first determination of Saturn's Love number,\n$k_2=0.390 \\pm 0.024$, a value larger than the commonly used theoretical value\nof 0.341 (Gavrilov & Zharkov, 1977), but compatible with more recent models\n(Helled & Guillot, 2013) for which $k_2$ ranges from 0.355 to 0.382. Depending\non the assumed spin for Saturn's interior, the new constraint can lead to a\nreduction of up to 80% in the number of potential models, offering great\nopportunities to probe the planet's interior. In addition, significant tidal\ndissipation within Saturn is confirmed (Lainey et al., 2012) corresponding to a\nhigh present-day tidal ratio $k_2/Q=(1.59 \\pm 0.74) \\times 10^{-4}$ and\nimplying fast orbital expansions of the moons. This high dissipation, with no\nobvious variations for tidal frequencies corresponding to those of Enceladus\nand Dione, may be explained by viscous friction in a solid core, implying a\ncore viscosity typically ranging between $10^{14}$ and $10^{16}$ Pa.s (Remus et\nal., 2012). However, a dissipation increase by one order of magnitude at Rhea's\nfrequency could suggest the existence of an additional, frequency-dependent,\ndissipation process, possibly from turbulent friction acting on tidal waves in\nthe fluid envelope of Saturn (Ogilvie & Li, 2004). Alternatively, a few of\nSaturn's moons might themselves experience large tidal dissipation.\n", "  The leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) of ground-state\n$^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ $c\\bar c$- and $b\\bar b$-quarkonia are calculated using a\nsymmetry-preserving continuum treatment of the meson bound-state problem which\nunifies the properties of these heavy-quark systems with those of light-quark\nbound-states, including QCD's Goldstone modes. Analysing the evolution of\n$^1S_0$ and $^3S_1$ PDAs with current-quark mass, $\\hat m_q$, increasing away\nfrom the chiral limit, it is found that in all cases there is a value of $\\hat\nm_q$ for which the PDA matches the asymptotic form appropriate to QCD's\nconformal limit and hence is insensitive to changes in renormalisation scale,\n$\\zeta$. This mass lies just above that associated with the $s$-quark. At\ncurrent-quark masses associated with heavy-quarkonia, on the other hand, the\nPDAs are piecewise convex-concave-convex. They are much narrower than the\nasymptotic distribution on a large domain of $\\zeta$; but nonetheless deviate\nnoticeably from $\\varphi_{Q\\bar Q}(x) = \\delta(x-1/2)$, which is the result in\nthe static-quark limit. There are also material differences between $^1S_0$ and\n$^3S_1$ PDAs, and between the PDAs for different vector-meson polarisations,\nwhich vanish slowly with increasing $\\zeta$. An analysis of moments of the\nroot-mean-square relative-velocity, $\\langle v^{2m}\\rangle$, in $^1S_0$ and\n$^3S_1$ systems reveals that $\\langle v^4\\rangle$-contributions may be needed\nin order to obtain a reliable estimate of matrix elements using such an\nexpansion, especially for processes involving heavy pseudoscalar quarkonia.\n", "  We illustrate the theory of one-dimensional pluri-Lagrangian systems with the\nexample of commuting billiard maps in confocal quadrics.\n", "  To understand, predict, and control complex networked systems, a prerequisite\nis to reconstruct the network structure from observable data. Despite recent\nprogress in network reconstruction, binary-state dynamics that are ubiquitous\nin nature, technology and society still present an outstanding challenge in\nthis field. Here we offer a framework for reconstructing complex networks with\nbinary-state dynamics by developing a universal data-based linearization\napproach that is applicable to systems with linear, nonlinear, discontinuous,\nor stochastic dynamics governed by monotonous functions. The linearization\nprocedure enables us to convert the network reconstruction into a sparse signal\nreconstruction problem that can be resolved through convex optimization. We\ndemonstrate generally high reconstruction accuracy for a number of complex\nnetworks associated with distinct binary-state dynamics from using binary data\ncontaminated by noise and missing data. Our framework is completely data\ndriven, efficient and robust, and does not require any a priori knowledge about\nthe detailed dynamical process on the network. The framework represents a\ngeneral paradigm for reconstructing, understanding, and exploiting complex\nnetworked systems with binary-state dynamics.\n", "  The growth rates of seeded QED cascades in counter propagating lasers are\ncalculated with first principles 2D/3D QED-PIC simulations. The dependence of\nthe growth rate on laser polarization and intensity are compared with\nanalytical models that support the findings of the simulations. The models\nprovide an insight regarding the qualitative trend of the cascade growth when\nthe intensity of the laser field is varied. A discussion about the cascade's\nthreshold is included, based on the analytical and numerical results. These\nresults show that relativistic pair plasmas and efficient conversion from laser\nphotons to gamma rays can be observed with the typical intensities planned to\noperate on future ultra-intense laser facilities such as ELI or VULCAN.\n", "  Extending the works arXiv:1504.05991 and arXiv:1510.02142, we study three\ndimensional Euclidean higher spin gravity with negative cosmological constant.\nThis theory can be formulated in terms of SL(N,C) Chern-Simons theory. By\nintroducing auxiliary fields, we rewrite it in a supersymmetric way and compute\nits partition function exactly by using the localization method. We obtain a\ngood expression for the partition function in terms of characters for the\nvacuum and primaries in 2D unitary CFT with W_N symmetry. We also check that\nthe coefficients of the character expansion are positive integers and exhibit\nCardy formula in the large central charge limit.\n", "  The divergent series for a function defined through Lapalce integral and the\nground state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator to large orders are\nstudied to test the generalized binomial transform which is the renamed version\nof $\\delta$-expansion proposed recently. We show that, by the use of the\ngeneralized binomial transform, the values of functions in the limit of zero of\nan argument is approximately computable from the series expansion around the\ninfinity of the same argument. In the Laplace integral, we investigate the\nsubject in detail with the aid of Mellin transform. In the anharmonic\noscillator, we compute the strong coupling limit of the ground state energy and\nalso the expansion coefficients at strong coupling from the weak coupling\nperturbation series. The obtained result is compared with that of the linear\ndelta expansion.\n", "  In dynamical system describing evolution of universe with the flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker symmetry filled with barotropic dust matter and\nnon-minimally coupled scalar field with a constant potential function an\ninvariant manifold of the de Sitter state is used to obtain exact solutions of\nthe reduced dynamics. Using observational data coming from distant supernovae\ntype Ia, the Hubble function $H(z)$ measurements and information coming from\nthe Alcock-Paczy$\\'n$ski test we find cosmological constraints on the\nnon-minimal coupling constant $\\xi$ between the scalar curvature and the scalar\nfield. For all investigated models we can exclude negative values of this\nparameter at the $68\\%$ confidence level. We obtain constraints on the\nnon-minimal coupling constant consistent with condition for conformal coupling\nof the scalar field in higher dimensional theories of gravity.\n", "  Maximal violation of the CHSH-Bell inequality is usually said to be a feature\nof anticommuting observables. In this work we show that even random observables\nexhibit near-maximal violations of the CHSH-Bell inequality. To do this, we use\nthe tools of free probability theory to analyze the commutators of large random\nmatrices. Along the way, we introduce the notion of \"free observables\" which\ncan be thought of as infinite-dimensional operators that reproduce the\nstatistics of random matrices as their dimension tends towards infinity. We\nalso study the fine-grained uncertainty of a sequence of free or random\nobservables, and use this to construct a steering inequality with a large\nviolation.\n", "  We extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum field theories with non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians and unstable states. Our derivation is a quite minimal one as it\nrequires only the time independent evolution of scalar products, invariance\nunder complex Lorentz transformations, and a non-standard but nonetheless\nperfectly legitimate interpretation of charge conjugation as an anti-linear\noperator. The first of these requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be\nHermitian. Rather, it forces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in\ncomplex conjugate pairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be\nconjugates of each other, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an anti-linear\nsymmetry. The latter two requirements then force this anti-linear symmetry to\nbe $CPT$, while forcing the Hamiltonian to be real rather than Hermitian. Our\nwork justifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the\nlifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. We\nshow that the Euclidean time path integrals of a $CPT$ symmetric theory must\nalways be real. In the quantum-mechanical limit the key results of the $PT$\nsymmetry program of Bender and collaborators are recovered, with the\n$C$-operator of the $PT$ symmetry program being identified with the linear\ncomponent of the charge conjugation operator.\n", "  Double Weyl nodes are topologically protected band crossing points which\ncarry chiral charge $\\pm2$. They are stabilized by $C_4$ point group symmetry\nand are predicted to occur in $\\mathrm{SrSi_2}$ or $\\mathrm{HgCr_{2}Se_{4}}$.\nWe study their fate in the presence of quenched disorder by numerical transport\ncalculations and scaling arguments. We find that a double Weyl node is unstable\nin a disordered environment and splits into a pair of emergent simple Weyl\nnodes which carry equal chiral charge of $\\pm1$. This pair of simple Weyl nodes\nis robust to disorder up to a certain critical disorder strength, in complete\nanalogy to their `elementary' counterparts.\n", "  This letter deals with the controllability issue of complex networks. An\nindex is chosen to quantitatively measure the extent of controllability of\ngiven network. The effect of this index is analyzed based on empirical studies\non various classes of network topologies, such as random network, small-world\nnetwork, and scale-free network.\n", "  Starting form a microscopic system-environment model, we construct a quantum\ndynamical semigroup for the reduced evolution of the open system. The\ndifference between the true system dynamics and its approximation by the\nsemigroup has the following two properties: It is (linearly) small in the\nsystem-environment coupling constant for all times, and it vanishes\nexponentially quickly in the large time limit. Our approach is based on the\nquantum dynamical resonance theory.\n", "  We show that a steady-state stock-flow consistent macro-economic model can be\nrepresented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).The set of solutions is\na polytope, which volume depends on the constraintsapplied and reveals the\npotential fragility of the economic circuit,with no need to study the dynamics.\nSeveral methods to compute the volume are compared, inspired by operations\nresearch methods and theanalysis of metabolic networks, both exact and\napproximate.We also introduce a random transaction matrix, and study the\nparticularcase of linear flows with respect to money stocks.\n", "  We study a model of resonant multilead point-contact tunneling by using the\nboundary state formulation. At a critical point the model is described by\nmulti-flavor chiral fermions on an infinite line with a point contact\ninteraction at the origin. By applying the folding procedure, previously\ndeveloped for the model of resonant point-contact tunneling of a single lead,\nwe map the model onto a non-chiral fermion model defined on the half line. The\nresonant point-contact tunneling interaction is transcribed into a non-local\neffective boundary interaction in the folded setup, where the boundary state\nformulation is applicable. We construct the boundary states for the models with\ntwo and three leads explicitly and evaluate the correlation functions of\ncurrents operators exactly. The electron transport between the leads is\ndominated by the resonant point-contact tunneling in the low frequency regime.\nWe observe some $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ group theoretical structures, which may be\nuseful to analyze more complex models.\n", "  Over the last decade new technologies for making large numbers of\nfine-grained measurements have led to the surprising discovery that many\nbiological systems sit near a critical point. These systems are potentially\nmore adaptive in that small changes to component behavior can induce\nlarge-scale changes in aggregate structure and function. Accounting for\ncriticality remains a challenge as sensitivity to perturbation suggests a lack\nof robustness. Furthermore, change induced by perturbation may not be adaptive.\nComplicating matters further critical phenomena can result from\nhistory-dependent stochastic processes. A question central to distinguishing\namong these conflicting views of criticality is to what degree criticality can\nbe controlled by the components of the system. We address the control of\ncriticality using data on conflict dynamics and fight sizes from an animal\nsociety model system (Macaca nemestrina, n=48). The system is fundamentally\nfinite so we operationalize criticality in information theoretic terms using\nFisher information and a measure of instability. We analyze criticality using\nempirically-grounded equilibrium (maximum entropy) and dynamic (branching\nprocess) models of the monkeys' fight-joining behavior. We find that (1) this\nheterogeneous, socially organized system, like homogeneous, spatial systems\n(flocks and schools), sits near a critical point, (2) the contributions\nindividuals make to how critical the system is can be quantified and vary, and\n(3) the distance from the critical point (DFC) can be controlled through\nbiologically plausible mechanisms operating on this heterogeneity. These\nmechanisms include third-party policing, which dampens fight participation of\nthe individuals with the largest effect on DFC. Control of DFC allows\nbiological systems to balance the tradeoff between robustness and need for\nrapid change.\n", "  We investigate the motion of a colloidal particle driven out of equilibrium\nby an external torque. We use the molecular dynamics simulation that is\nalternative to the numerical integration approach based on the Langevin\nequation and is expected to mimic an experiment more realistically. We choose a\nheat bath composed of thousands of particles interacting to each other through\nthe Lennard-Jones potential and impose the Langevin thermostat to maintain it\nin equilibrium. We prepare a single colloidal particle to interact with the\nparticles of the heat bath also by the Lennard-Jones potential while any\ndissipative force and noise are not employed. We prepare the simulation\nprotocol fit to the overdamped limit in real experiments by increasing the size\nand mass of the colloidal particle. We study the stochastic properties of the\nnonequilibrium fluctuations for work and heat produced incessantly in time. We\naccurately confirm the fluctuation theorem for the work production. We show our\nresults to agree accurately with those from the numerical integration of the\nLangevin equation.\n", "  We study a class of discrete focusing nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equations\n(DNLS) with general nonlocal interactions. We prove the existence of onsite and\noffsite discrete solitary waves, which bifurcate from the trivial solution at\nthe endpoint frequency of the continuous spectrum of linear dispersive waves.\nWe also prove exponential smallness, in the frequency-distance to the\nbifurcation point, of the Peierls-Nabarro energy barrier (PNB), as measured by\nthe difference in Hamiltonian or mass functionals evaluated on the onsite and\noffsite states. These results extend those of the authors for the case of\nnearest neighbor interactions to a large class of nonlocal short-range and\nlong-range interactions. The appearance of distinct onsite and offsite states\nis a consequence of the breaking of continuous spatial translation invariance.\nThe PNB plays a role in the dynamics of energy transport in such nonlinear\nHamiltonian lattice systems.\n  Our class of nonlocal interactions is defined in terms of coupling\ncoefficients, $J_m$, where $m\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ is the lattice site index, with\n$J_m\\simeq m^{-1-2s}, s\\in[1,\\infty)$ and $J_m\\sim e^{-\\gamma|m|},\\ s=\\infty,\\\n\\gamma>0,$ (Kac-Baker). For $s\\ge1$, the bifurcation is seeded by solutions of\nthe (effective / homogenized) cubic focusing nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation\n(NLS). However, for $1/4<s<1$, the bifurcation is controlled by the fractional\nnonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation, FNLS, with $(-\\Delta)^s$ replacing\n$-\\Delta$. The proof is based on a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction strategy applied\nto a momentum space formulation. The PN barrier bounds require appropriate\nuniform decay estimates for the discrete Fourier transform of DNLS discrete\nsolitary waves. A key role is also played by non-degeneracy of the ground state\nof FNLS, recently proved by Frank, Lenzmann \\& Silvestre.\n", "  We investigate the structure of certain protected operator algebras that\narise in three-dimensional N=4 superconformal field theories. We find that\nthese algebras can be understood as a quantization of (either of) the half-BPS\nchiral ring(s). An important feature of this quantization is that it has a\npreferred basis in which the structure constants of the quantum algebra are\nequal to the OPE coefficients of the underlying superconformal theory. We\nidentify several nontrivial conditions that the quantum algebra must satisfy in\nthis basis. We consider examples of theories for which the moduli space of\nvacua is either the minimal nilpotent orbit of a simple Lie algebra or a\nKleinian singularity. For minimal nilpotent orbits, the quantum algebras (and\ntheir preferred bases) can be uniquely determined. These algebras are related\nto higher spin algebras. For Kleinian singularities the algebras can be\ncharacterized abstractly - they are spherical subalgebras of symplectic\nreflection algebras - but the preferred basis is not easily determined. We find\nevidence in these examples that for a given choice of quantum algebra (defined\nup to a certain gauge equivalence), there is at most one choice of canonical\nbasis. We conjecture that this is the case for general N=4 SCFTs.\n", "  We investigate adiabatic pumping via a single level quantum dot induced by\nperiodic modulation of thermodynamic variables of reservoirs, i.e.,\ntemperatures and electrochemical potentials. We consider the impurity Anderson\nmodel and derive analytical formulas for coherent adiabatic charge pumping\napplicable to the strong dot-reservoir coupling within first-order perturbation\nwith respect to Coulomb interaction. We show that charge pumping is induced by\nrectification effect due to delayed response of the quantum dot to\ntime-dependent reservoir parameters. The presence of interaction is necessary\nbecause this delayed response rectifies charge current via Coulomb interaction.\nFor temperature-driven charge pumping, one-way pumping is realized regardless\nof reservoir temperatures when an energy level of the quantum dot locates near\nthe Fermi level. We clarify that this new feature of adiabatic pumping is\ncaused by level broadening effect of the quantum dot due to strong\ndot-reservoir coupling.\n", "  The GERDA experiment at LNGS of INFN is equipped with an active muon veto.\nThe main part of the system is a water Cherenkov veto with 66~PMTs in the water\ntank surrounding the GERDA cryostat. The muon flux recorded by this veto shows\na seasonal modulation. Two effects have been identified which are caused by\nsecondary muons from the CNGS neutrino beam (2.2 %) and a temperature\nmodulation of the atmosphere (1.4 %). A mean cosmic muon rate of $I^0_{\\mu} =\n(3.477 \\pm 0.002_{\\textrm{stat}} \\pm 0.067_{\\textrm{sys}}) \\times\n10^{-4}$/(s$\\cdot$m$^2$) was found in good agreement with other experiments at\nLNGS at a depth of 3500~meter water equivalent.\n", "  We describe a project-based physics lab, which we proposed to third-year\nuniversity students. Theses labs are based on new open-source low-cost\nequipment (Arduino microcontrollers and compatible sensors). Students are given\ncomplete autonomy: they develop their own experimental setup and study the\nphysics topic of their choice. The goal of these projects is to let students\ndiscover the reality of experimental physics. Technical specifications of the\nacquisition material and case studies are presented for practical\nimplementation in other universities.\n", "  Diffusion is a central phenomenon in almost all fields of natural science\nrevealing microscopic processes from the observation of macroscopic dynamics.\nHere, we consider the paradigmatic system of a single atom diffusing in a\nperiodic potential. We engineer microscopic particle-environment interaction to\ncontrol the ensuing diffusion over a broad range of diffusion constants and\nfrom normal to subdiffusion. While one- and two-point properties extracted from\nsingle particle trajectories, such as variance or position correlations,\nindicate apparent Brownian motion, the step size distribution, however, shows\nexponentially decaying tails. Furthermore non-ergodic dynamics is observed on\nlong time scales. We demonstrate excellent agreement with a model of continuous\ntime random walk with exponential distribution, which applies to various\ntransport phenomena in condensed or soft matter with periodic potentials.\n", "  Using exact diagonalization, we investigate the many-body ground state for\nvortex patterns in a rotating Bose-condensed gas of $N$ spinless particles,\nconfined in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap and interacting repulsively\nvia finite-range Gaussian potential. The $N$-body Hamiltonian matrix is\ndiagonalized in given subspaces of quantized total angular momentum $L_{z}$, to\nobtain the lowest-energy eigenstate. Further, the internal structure of these\neigenstates is analyzed by calculating the corresponding conditional\nprobability distribution. Specifically, the quantum mechanically stable as well\nas unstable states in a co-rotating frame are examined in the moderately\nrotating regime corresponding to angular momenta $4N \\le L_{z} < 5N$ for $N=16$\nbosons. In response to externally impressed rotation, patterns of singly\nquantized vortices are formed, shaping into canonical polygons with a central\nvortex at the trap center. The internal structure of unstable states reveals\nthe mechanism of entry, nucleation and pattern formation of vortices with\nstructural phase transition, as the condensate goes from one stable vortical\nstate to the other. The stable polygonal vortex patterns having discrete\n$p$-fold rotational symmetry with $p=5$ and $p=6$ are observed. The hexagonal\nvortex pattern with $p=6$ symmetry is a precursor to the triangular vortex\nlattice of singly quantized vortices in the thermodynamic limit. For unstable\nstates, quantum melting of vortex patterns due to uncertainty in positions of\nindividual vortices, is also briefly discussed.\n", "  The normal and the lateral Casimir interactions between corrugated ideal\nmetallic plates in the presence of an amplifying or an absorptive dielectric\nslab has been studied by the path-integral quantization technique. The effect\nof the amplifying slab, which is located between corrugated conductors, is to\nincrease the normal and lateral Casimir interactions, while the presence of the\nabsorptive slab diminishes the interactions. These effects are more pronounced\nif the thickness of the slab increases, and also if the slab comes closer to\none of the bounding conductors. When both bounding ideal conductors are flat,\nthe normal Casimir force is non-monotonic in the presence of the amplifying\nslab and the system has a stable mechanical equilibrium state, while the force\nis attractive and is weakened by intervening the absorptive dielectric slab in\nthe cavity. By replacing one of the flat conductors by a flat ideal permeable\nplate the force becomes non-monotonic and the system has an unstable mechanical\nequilibrium state in the presence of either an amplifying or an absorptive\nslab. When the left side plate is conductor and the right one is permeable, the\nforce is non-monotonic in the presence of a double-layer DA\n(dissipative-amplifying) dielectric slab with a stable mechanical equilibrium\nstate, while it is purely repulsive in the presence of a double-layer AD\n(amplifying-dissipative) dielectric slab.\n", "  The strength of hydrogen bonding in water is stronger than that of van der\nwaals interaction, therefore water may play an important role in the process of\nhydrophobic effects. When a hydrophobic solute is dissolved into water, an\ninterface appears between the solute and water. To understand the mechanism of\nhydrophobic effects, it is necessary to study the structure of water and\nsolute/water interface. In this study, based on the structural studies on water\nand air/water interface, the hydration free energy is derived, and utilized to\ninvestigate the physical origin of hydrophobic effects. According to the\ndiscussion on hydration free energy, with increasing solute size, it can be\ndivided into the initial and hydrophobic solvation processes, respectively. In\nthe initial solvation process, hydration free energy is dominated by the\nhydrogen bonding in interfacial water (topmost water layer at the solute/water\ninterface). However, in the hydrophobic solvation process, the hydration free\nenergy is related to hydrogen bondings of both bulk water and interfacial\nwater. Additionally, various dissolved behaviors of solutes can be expected for\ndifferent solvation processes. From this, hydrophobic effects can be ascribed\nto the competition between the hydrogen bondings in bulk water and those in\ninterfacial water.\n", "  The discovery of two-dimensional topological photonic systems has transformed\nour views on electromagnetic propagation and scattering of classical waves, and\na quest for similar states in three dimensions, known to exist in condensed\nmatter systems, has been put forward. Here we demonstrate that symmetry\nprotected three-dimensional topological states can be engineered in an\nall-dielectric platform with the electromagnetic duality between electric and\nmagnetic fields ensured by the structure design. Magneto-electric coupling\nplaying the role of a synthetic gauge field leads to a topological transition\nto an insulating regime with a complete three-dimensional photonic bandgap. An\nemergence of surface states with conical Dirac dispersion and spin-locking is\nunimpeded. Robust propagation of surface states along two-dimensional domain\nwalls defined by the reversal of magneto-electric coupling is confirmed\nnumerically by first principle studies. It is shown that the proposed system\nrepresents a table-top platform for emulating relativistic physics of massive\nDirac fermions and the surface states revealed can be interpreted as\nJackiw-Rebbi states confined to the interface between two domains with opposite\nparticle masses.\n", "  A short review on the self-consistent RPA based on a energy-density\nfunctional of the Skyrme type is given. We also present an extension of the RPA\nwhere the coupling of phonons to the single-particle states is considered.\nWithin this approach we present numerical results which are compared with data.\nThe self-consistent approach is compared with the Landau-Migdal theory. Here we\nderive from the self-consistent $ph$ interaction, the Landau-Migdal parameters\nas well as their density dependence. In the Appendix a new derivation of the\nreduced matrix elements of the $ph$ interaction is presented.\n", "  It is generally believed that a Wigner Crystal in single layer graphene can\nnot form because the magnitudes of the Coulomb interaction and the kinetic\nenergy scale similarly with decreasing electron density. However, this scaling\nargument does not hold for the low energy states in bilayer graphene. We\nconsider the formation of a Wigner Crystal in weakly doped bilayer graphene\nwith an energy gap opened by a perpendicular electric field. We argue that in\nthis system the formation of the Wigner Crystal is not only possible, but\ndifferent phases of the crystal with very peculiar properties may exist here\ndepending on the system parameters.\n", "  It is well known that the interaction of quantum systems with the environment\nreduces the inherent quantum correlations. Under special circumstances the\neffect of decoherence can be reversed, for example, the interaction modeled by\nan amplitude damping channel can boost the teleportation fidelity from the\nclassical to the quantum region for a bipartite quantum state. Here, we first\nshow that this phenomena fails in the case of a quantum key distribution\nprotocol. We further show that the technique of weak measurement can be used to\nslow down the process of decoherence, thereby helping to preserve the quantum\nkey rate when one or both systems are interacting with the environment via an\namplitude damping channel. Most interestingly, in certain cases weak\nmeasurement with post-selection where one considers both success and failure of\nthe technique is shown to be more useful than without it when both systems\ninteract with the environment.\n", "  The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) yields information about our Universe\nat around 380 000 years after the Big Bang (BB). Due to the weak interaction of\nthe neutrinos with matter the Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) should give\ninformation about a much earlier time of our Universe, around one second after\nthe Big Bang. Probably the most promising method to `see' the Cosmic Neutrino\nBackground is the capture of the electron neutrinos from the Background by\nTritium, which then decays into 3He and an electron with the energy of the the\nQ-value = 18.562 keV plus the electron neutrino rest mass. The `KArlsruhe\nTRItium Neutrino' (KATRIN) experiment, which is in preparation, seems presently\nthe most sensitive proposed method for measuring the electron antineutrino\nmass. At the same time KATRIN can also look by the reaction: electron neutrino\n(~1.95 Kelvin) + 3H --> 3He + e- (with the energy Q = 18.6 keV + electron\nneutrino mass). The capture of the Cosmic Background Neutrinos (CNB) should\nshow in the electron spectrum as a peak by the electron neutrino rest mass\nabove Q. Here the possibility to see the CNB with KATRIN is studied. A\ndetection of the CNB by KATRIN seems not to be possible at the moment. But\nKATRIN should be able to determine an upper limit for the local electron\nneutrino density of the CNB.\n", "  It is shown that all of the basic properties of the hydrogen atom can be\nconsistently described in terms of classical electrodynamics instead of taking\nthe electron to be a particle; we consider an electrically charged classical\nwave field, an \"electron wave\", which is held in a limited region of space by\nthe electrostatic field of the proton. It is shown that quantum mechanics must\nbe considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in\nthe spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with\ndifficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of\nclassical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the\nspontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually\nderived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. It is shown that there are\nno discrete states and discrete energy levels of the atom: the energy of the\natom and its states change continuously. An explanation of the conventional\ncorpuscular-statistical interpretation of atomic phenomena is given. It is\nshown that this explanation is only a misinterpretation of continuous\ndeterministic processes. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, the\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation is obtained, which accounts for the inverse\naction of self-electromagnetic radiation of the electron wave and completely\ndescribes the spontaneous emissions of an atom.\n", "  We consider the radiative transport equation in which the time derivative is\nreplaced by the Caputo derivative. Such fractional-order derivatives are\nrelated to anomalous transport and anomalous diffusion. In this paper we\ndescribe how the time-fractional radiative transport equation is obtained from\ncontinuous-time random walk and see how the equation is related to the\ntime-fractional diffusion equation in the asymptotic limit. Then we solve the\nequation with Legendre-polynomial expansion.\n", "  Probing the relative speeds of gravitational waves and light acts as an\nimportant test of General Relativity and alternative theories of gravity.\nMeasuring the arrival time of gravitational waves and electromagnetic\ncounterparts can be used to measure the relative speeds, but only if the\nintrinsic time-lag between emission of the photons and gravitational waves is\nwell understood. Here we suggest a method that does not make such an\nassumption, using future strongly lensed GW events and EM counterparts;\nBiesiada et al forecast that 50-100 strongly lensed GW events will be observed\neach year with the Einstein Telescope. A single strongly lensed GW event would\nproduce robust constraints on the ratio of speeds of GWs and light at the\n$10^{-7}$ level, if a high energy EM counterpart is observed within the\nfield-of-view of an observing gamma ray burst monitor.\n", "  We report a new particle in cell (PIC) method based on the semi-implicit\napproach. The novelty of the new method is that unlike any of its semi-implicit\npredecessors at the same time retains the explicit computational cycle and\nconserves energy exactly. Recent research has presented fully implicit methods\nwhere energy conservation is obtained as part of a non linear iteration\nprocedure. The new method (referred to as Energy Conserving Semi-Implicit\nMethod, ECSIM), instead, does not require any non-linear iteration and its\ncomputational cycle is similar to that of explicit PIC.\n  The properties of the new method are: i) it conserves energy exactly to\nround-off for any time step or grid spacing; ii) it is unconditionally stable\nin time, freeing the user from the need to resolve the electron plasma\nfrequency and allowing the user to select any desired time step; iii) it\neliminates the constraint of the finite grid instability, allowing the user to\nselect any desired resolution without being forced to resolve the Debye length;\niv) the particle mover has a computational complexity identical to that of the\nexplicit PIC, only the field solver has an increased computational cost.\n  The new ECSIM is tested in a number of benchmarks where accuracy and\ncomputational performance are tested.\n", "  A quantum Hall edge state provides a rich foundation to study electrons in\n1-dimension (1d) but is limited to chiral propagation along a single direction.\nHere, we demonstrate a versatile platform to realize new 1d systems made by\ncombining quantum Hall edge states of opposite chiralities in a graphene\nelectron-hole bilayer. Using this approach, we engineer helical 1d edge\nconductors where the counterpropagating modes are localized in separate\nelectron and hole layers by a tunable electric field. These helical conductors\nexhibit strong nonlocal transport signals and suppressed backscattering due to\nthe opposite spin polarizations of the counterpropagating modes. Moreover, we\ninvestigate these electron-hole bilayers in the fractional quantum Hall regime,\nwhere we observe conduction through fractional and integer edge states of\nopposite chiralities, paving the way towards the realization of 1d helical\nsystems with fractional quantum statistics.\n", "  For the constant astigmatism equation, we construct a system of nonlocal\nconservation laws (an abelian covering) closed under the reciprocal\ntransformations. We give functionally independent potentials modulo a Wronskian\ntype relation.\n", "  We combine the thermal QRPA approach with the Skyrme energy density\nfunctional theory (Skyrme-TQRPA) for modelling the process of electron capture\non nuclei in supernova environment. For a sample nucleus, $^{56}$Fe, the\nSkyrme-TQRPA approach is applied to analyze thermal effects on the strength\nfunction of GT$_+$ transitions which dominate electron capture at $E_e\\le\n30$~MeV. Several Skyrme interactions are used in order to verify the\nsensitivity of the obtained results to the Skyrme force parameters.\nFinite-temperature cross sections are calculated and the results are compared\nwith those of the other model calculations.\n", "  Quantum phase slip (QPS) is the topological singularity of the complex order\nparameter of a quasi-one-dimensional superconductor: momentary zeroing of the\nmodulus and simultaneous 'slip' of the phase by 2\\pi. The QPS event(s) are the\ndynamic equivalent of tunneling through a conventional Josephson junction\ncontaining static in space and time weak link(s). Here we demonstrate the\noperation of a superconducting single electron transistor (Cooper pair\ntransistor) without any tunnel junctions. Instead a pair of thin\nsuperconducting titanium wires in QPS regime were used. The current-voltage\ncharacteristics demonstrate the clear Coulomb blockade with magnitude of the\nCoulomb gap modulated by the gate potential. The Coulomb blockade disappears\nabove the critical temperature, and at low temperatures can be suppressed by\nstrong magnetic field.\n", "  We study the role of dephasing in transport through different structures. We\nshow that interference effects invalidate Kirchhoff's circuit laws in quantum\ndevices. We present circuits where the particle transport and the direction of\nrectification can be controlled through the dephasing strength. This suggests\nthe possibility of constructing molecular devices with new functionalities\nwhich use dephasing as a control parameter.\n", "  We propose a radiative seesaw model in alternative left-right model without\nany bidoublet scalar fields, in which all the fermion masses in the standard\nmodel are generated through a canonical seesaw mechanism at the tree level. On\nthe other hand the observed neutrino masses are generated at two-loop level. In\nthis paper we focus on the neutrino sector and show how to induce the active\nneutrino masses. Then we discuss the observed neutrino oscillation, constraints\nfrom lepton flavor violations, new sources of muon anomalous magnetic moment, a\nlong-lived dark matter candidate with keV scale mass, and collider physics.\n", "  Force sensors are at the heart of different technologies such as atomic force\nmicroscopy or inertial sensing \\cite{RMPforce2003, Rugar2004, YazdiIEEE}. These\nsensors often rely on the measurement of the displacement amplitude of\nmechanical oscillators under applied force. Examples for such mechanical\noscillators include micro-fabricated cantilevers \\cite{YazdiIEEE}, carbon\nnanotubes \\cite{NanotubeForce} as well as single trapped ions \\cite{Bollinger,\nUdem} . The best sensitivity is typically achieved when the force is\nalternating at the mechanical resonance frequency of the oscillator thus\nincreasing its response by the mechanical quality factor. The measurement of\nlow-frequency forces, that are below resonance, is a more difficult task as the\nresulting oscillation amplitudes are significantly lower. Here we use a single\ntrapped $^{88}Sr^{+}$ ion as a force sensor. The ion is trapped in a linear\nharmonic trap, and is electrically driven at a frequency much lower than the\ntrap resonance frequency. To be able to measure the small amplitude of motion\nwe combine two powerful techniques. The force magnitude is determined by the\nmeasured periodic Doppler shift of an atomic optical clock transition and the\nQuantum Lock-in technique is used to coherently accumulate the phases acquired\nduring different force half-cycles. We demonstrate force detection both when\nthe oscillating force is phase-synchronized with the quantum lock-in sequence\nand when it is asynchronous and report frequency force detection sensitivity as\nlow as $5.3\\times10^{-19}\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}}$ .\n", "  Reaction coordinates are widely used throughout chemical physics to model and\nunderstand complex chemical transformations. We introduce a definition of the\nnatural reaction coordinate, suitable for condensed phase and biomolecular\nsystems, as a maximally predictive one-dimensional projection. We then show\nthis criterion is uniquely satisfied by a dominant eigenfunction of an integral\noperator associated with the ensemble dynamics. We present a new sparse\nestimator for these eigenfunctions which can search through a large candidate\npool of structural order parameters and build simple, interpretable\napproximations that employ only a small number of these order parameters.\nExample applications with a small molecule's rotational dynamics and\nsimulations of protein conformational change and folding show that this\napproach can filter through statistical noise to identify simple reaction\ncoordinates from complex dynamics.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity is characterized by the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the macroscopic superconducting wavefunction in addition to the\ngauge symmetry breaking, such as rotational-symmetry breaking with respect to\nthe underlying crystal-lattice symmetry. Particularly, superconductivity with\nspontaneous rotational-symmetry breaking in the wavefunction amplitude and thus\nin bulk properties, not yet reported previously, is intriguing and can be\ntermed \"nematic\" superconductivity in analogy to nematic liquid-crystal phases.\nHere, based on specific-heat measurements of the single-crystalline\nCu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under accurate magnetic-field-direction control, we report\nthermodynamic evidence for nematic superconductivity, namely, clear\ntwo-fold-symmetric behavior in a trigonal lattice. The results indicate\nrealization of an \"odd-parity nematic\" state, feasible only by macroscopic\nquantum condensates and distinct from nematic states in liquid crystals. The\nresults also confirm topologically non-trivial superconductivity in\nCu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  Strange metallicity is now a pseudonym for a novel metallic state exhibiting\nanomalous infra-red (branch-cut) continuum features in one and two particle\nresponses. Here, we employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using very\nlow-temperature continuous-time-quantum Monte-Carlo (CTQMC) solver for an\nextended periodic Anderson model (EPAM) model to investigate unusual magnetic\nfluctuations in the strange metal. We show how extinction of Landau\nquasiparticles in the orbital selective Mott phase (OSMP) leads to (i)\nqualitative explication of strange transport features and (ii) anomalous\nquantum critical magnetic fluctuations due to critical liquid-like features in\ndynamical spin fluctuations, in excellent accord with data in some f-electron\nsystems.\n", "  Approach images taken by the LORRI imaging system during the New Horizons\nspacecraft encounter have been used to determine the mean radii and shapes of\nPluto and Charon. The primary observations are limb locations derived using\nthree independent approaches. The resulting mean radii of Pluto and Charon are\n1188.3 +/- 1.6 km and 606.0 +/- 1.0 km, respectively (2-sigma). The\ncorresponding densities are 1854 +/- 11 kg m-3 and 1701 +/- 33 kg m-3\n(2-sigma). The Charon radius value is consistent with previous Earth-based\noccultation estimates. The Pluto radius estimate is consistent with solar\noccultation measurements performed by the ALICE and Fine Sun Sensor instruments\non New Horizons. Neither Pluto nor Charon show any evidence for\ntidal/rotational distortions; upper bounds on the oblateness are <0.6% and\n<0.5%, respectively.\n", "  The development of the chiral dynamics based description of nuclear\nelectroweak currents is reviewed. Gerald E. (Gerry) Brown's role in basing\ntheoretical nuclear physics on chiral Lagrangians is emphasized. Illustrative\nexamples of the successful description of electroweak observables of light\nnuclei obtained from chiral effective field theory are presented.\n", "  We initiate a comprehensive survey of axion inflation in compactifications of\ntype IIB string theory on Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties. For\nevery threefold with $h^{1,1} \\le 4$ in the Kreuzer-Skarke database, we compute\nthe metric on K\\\"ahler moduli space, as well as the matrix of four-form axion\ncharges of Euclidean D3-branes on rigid divisors. These charges encode the\npossibility of enlarging the field range via alignment. We then determine an\nupper bound on the inflationary field range $\\Delta \\phi$ that results from the\nleading instanton potential, in the absence of monodromy. The bound on the\nfield range in this ensemble is $\\Delta \\phi \\lesssim 0.3 M_{\\rm{pl}}$, in a\ncompactification where the smallest curve volume is $(2\\pi)^2\\alpha'$, and we\nargue that the sigma model expansion is adequately controlled. The largest\nincrease resulting from alignment is a factor $\\approx 2.6$. We also examine a\nset of threefolds with $h^{1,1}$ up to $100$ and characterize their axion\ncharge matrices. We discuss how our findings could be modified by the effects\nof orientifolding, seven-branes, and fluxes.\n", "  S-matrix amplitudes for the electron-electron scattering are calculated in\norder to verify the quantum equivalence of dual models. We used an extended\nQuantum Electrodynamics with CPT-even Lorentz-violating kinetic and mass terms,\nwhich was used in a process of gauge embedding, known as Noether dualizationn\nmethod (NDM), in order to generate its gauge-invariant dual model. The physical\nequivalence was established at tree-level and the cross section was calculated\nto second order in the Lorentz-violating parameter.\n", "  Results of experimental investigations of a neutron resonances width in\nplanar waveguides using the time-of-flight reflectometer REMUR of the IBR-2\npulsed reactor are reported and comparison with theoretical calculations is\npresented. The intensity of the neutron microbeam emitted from the waveguide\nedge was registered as a function of the neutron wavelength and the incident\nbeam angular divergence. The possible applications of this method for the\ninvestigations of layered nanostructures are discussed.\n", "  Stability assessment methods for dynamical systems have recently been\ncomplemented by basin stability and derived measures, i.e. probabilistic\nstatements whether systems remain in a basin of attraction given a distribution\nof perturbations. This requires numerical estimation via Monte-Carlo sampling\nand integration of differential equations. Here, we analyze the applicability\nof basin stability to systems with basin geometries challenging for this\nnumerical method, having fractal basin boundaries and riddled or intermingled\nbasins of attraction. We find that numerical basin stability estimation is\nstill meaningful for fractal boundaries but reaches its limits for riddled\nbasins with holes.\n", "  In a mesoscopic sample of a chiral $p\\,$-wave superconductor, novel states\ncomprising skyrmions and edge states have been stabilized in out-of-plane\napplied magnetic field. Using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we\nshed light on the dynamic response of such states to an external applied\ncurrent. Three different regimes are obtained, namely, the superconducting\n(stationary), resistive (non-stationary) and normal regime, similarly to\nconventional $s$-wave superconductors. However, in the resistive regime and\ndepending on the external current, we found that moving skyrmions and the edge\nstate behave distinctly different from the conventional kinematic vortex,\nthereby providing new fingerprints for identification of $p\\,$-wave\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  A characteristic property of superfluidity and -conductivity is the presence\nof quantized vortices in rotating systems. To study the BEC-BCS crossover the\ntwo most common methods are the Bogoliubov-De Gennes theory and the usage of an\neffective field theory. In order to simplify the calculations for one vortex,\nit is often assumed that the hyperbolic tangent yields a good approximation for\nthe vortex structure. The combination of a variational vortex structure,\ntogether with cylindrical symmetry yields analytic (or numerically simple)\nexpressions. The focus of this article is to investigate to what extent this\nanalytic fit truly reflects the vortex structure throughout the BEC-BCS\ncrossover at finite temperatures. The vortex structure will be determined using\nthe effective field theory presented in [Eur. Phys. Journal B 88, 122 (2015)]\nand compared to the variational analytic solution. By doing this it is possible\nto see where these two structures agree, and where they differ. This comparison\nresults in a range of applicability where the hyperbolic tangent will be a good\nfit for the vortex structure.\n", "  We extend the Noether theory of invariants to the Poincare equations. We\napply this extension to the Maxwell-Lorentz equations coupled to the Abraham\nrotating extended electron with the configuration space SO(3).\n", "  As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, (transient)\nsuperballistic transport is not well understood but it has been experimentally\nobserved recently. We here calculate the white noise effect (in Markov\napproximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model with\ndisordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to perfect lattices at\nboth ends. Here we show the effect of white noise on spreading of the wave\npacket initially located at the center of the sublattice. We find threshold\nvalues of the white noise strength, beyond which the quantum hyperdiffusion\ndoes not occur. We predict from our numerical studies that the quantum\nhyperdiffusion exponent can be tuned by the strength of applied white noise.\nTherefore we can manually apply noise to a system to drive it to desired\ndiffusion rate.\n", "  Understanding stellar birth requires observations of the clouds in which they\nform. These clouds are dense and self-gravitating, and in all existing\nobservations, they are molecular with H_2 the dominant species and CO the best\navailable tracer. When the abundances of carbon and oxygen are low compared to\nhydrogen, and the opacity from dust is also low, as in primeval galaxies and\nlocal dwarf irregular galaxies, CO forms slowly and is easily destroyed, so it\nis difficult for it to accumulate inside dense clouds. Here we report\ninterferometric observations of CO clouds in the local group dwarf irregular\ngalaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM), which has a metallicity that is 13% of the\nsolar value and 50% lower than the previous CO detection threshold. The clouds\nare tiny compared to the surrounding atomic and H_2 envelopes, but they have\ntypical densities and column densities for CO clouds in the Milky Way. The\nnormal CO density explains why star clusters forming in dwarf irregulars have\nsimilar densities to star clusters in giant spiral galaxies. The low cloud\nmasses suggest that these clusters will also be low mass, unless some\ngalaxy-scale compression occurs, such as an impact from a cosmic cloud or other\ngalaxy. If the massive metal-poor globular clusters in the halo of the Milky\nWay formed in dwarf galaxies, as is commonly believed, then they were probably\ntriggered by such an impact.\n", "  A thin single-element THGEM-based, Resistive-Plate WELL (RPWELL) detector was\noperated with 150 GeV/c muon and pion beams in Ne/(5%CH$_4$), Ar/(5%CH$_4$) and\nAr/(7%CO$_2$); signals were recorded with 1 cm$^2$ square pads and SRS/APV25\nelectronics. Detection efficiency values greater than 98% were reached in all\nthe gas mixtures, at average pad multiplicity of 1.2. The use of the\n10$^9${\\Omega}cm resistive plate resulted in a completely discharge-free\noperation also in intense pion beams. The efficiency remained essentially\nconstant at 98-99% up to fluxes of $\\sim$10$^4$Hz/cm$^2$, dropping by a few %\nwhen approaching 10$^5$ Hz/cm$^2$. These results pave the way towards\ncost-effective, robust, efficient, large-scale detectors for a variety of\napplications in future particle, astro-particle and applied fields. A potential\ntarget application is digital hadron calorimetry.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of communication over a memoryless\nclassical-quantum wiretap channel subject to the constraint that the\neavesdropper on the channel should not be able to learn whether the legitimate\nparties are using the channel to communicate or not. Specifically, the relative\nentropy between the output quantum states at the eavesdropper when a codeword\nis transmitted and when no input is provided must be sufficiently small.\nExtending earlier works, this paper proves the \"square-root law\" for a broad\nclass of classical-quantum channels: the maximum amount of information that can\nbe reliably and covertly transmitted over $n$ uses of such a channel scales\nlike $\\sqrt{n}$. The scaling constant is also determined.\n", "  We review the status of bouncing cosmologies as alternatives to cosmological\ninflation for providing a description of the very early universe, and a source\nfor the cosmological perturbations which are observed today. We focus on the\nmotivation for considering bouncing cosmologies, the origin of fluctuations in\nthese models, and the challenges which various implementations face.\n", "  The notion of a parallelizable distribution has been introduced and\ninvestigated. A non-integrable parallelizable distribution carries a natural\nsub-Riemannian structure. The geometry of this structure has been studied from\nthe bi-viewpoint of absolute parallelism geometry and sub-Riemannian geometry.\nTwo remarkable linear connections have been constructed on a sub-Riemannian\nparallelizable distribution, namely, the Weitzenb\\\"ock connection and the\nsub-Riemannian connection. The obtained results have been applied to two\nconcrete examples: the spheres $S^3$ and $S^7$.\n", "  The India based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is a mega science project of\nIndia, which is going to use near about 30, 000 Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC)\nas active detector elements for the study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations.\nEach RPC detector will consist of two orthogonally placed readout strips panel\nfor picking the signals generated in the gas chamber. The area of RPC detector\nin INO-ICAL (Iron Calorimeter) experiment will be 2m x 2m, therefore the\ndimension of readout strips panel will also be of 2m x 2m. To get undistorted\nsignals pass through the readout strips panel to frontend electronics, their\nCharacteristic Impedance should be matched with each other. For the matching of\nCharacteristic Impedance we have used the principle of termination. In the\npresent paper we will describe the need and search of new dielectric material\nfor the fabrication of flame resistant, waterproof and flexible readout pickup\nstrips panel. We will also describe the measurement of Characteristic Impedance\nof plastic honeycomb based readout strips panel and Silicon Fiber sheet based\nreadout strips panel in a comparative way, and its variation under loading and\nwith time.\n", "  Dense compact objects like neutron stars or black holes have always been one\nof Gerry Brown's favorite research topics. This is closely related to the\neffects of strangeness in nuclear physics. Here, we review the chiral Effective\nField Theory approach to interactions involving nucleons and hyperons, the\npossible existence of strange dibaryons, the fate of hyperons in nuclear matter\nand the present status of three-body forces involving hyperons and nucleons.\n", "  Using the discrete element method (DEM), we study the splash processes\ninduced by the impact of a grain on two types of granular beds, namely,\nrandomly packed and FCC-structured beds.Good correspondence is obtained between\nour numerical results and the findings of previous experiments, and it is\ndemonstrated that the packing structure of the granular bed strongly affects\nthe splash process.The mean ejection angle for the randomly packed bed is\nconsistent with previous experimental results. The FCC-structured bed yields a\nlarger mean ejection angle; however, the latter result has not been confirmed\nexperimentally. Furthermore, the ejection angle distributions and the vertical\nejection speeds for individual grains vary depending on the relative timing at\nwhich the grains are ejected after the initial impact. Obvious differences are\nobserved between the distributions of grains ejected during the earlier and\nlater splash periods: the form of the vertical ejection speed distribution\nvaries from a power-law form to a lognormal form with time, and more than 80\\%\nof the kinetic energy of all ejected grains is used for earlier ejected grains.\n", "  This article reviews the theory of electron-phonon interactions in solids\nfrom the point of view of ab-initio calculations. While the electron-phonon\ninteraction has been studied for almost a century, predictive non-empirical\ncalculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is\npossible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related\nto the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of\nconventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the\ntemperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap\nsemiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron\nmass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the\nnon-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. Here we review the\ntheoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon\ncalculations from first principles, as well as landmark investigations of the\nelectron-phonon interaction in real materials. In the first part of the article\nwe summarize the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their\ncalculations based on density-functional theory. In the second part we discuss\na general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem, and\nestablish the connection with practical first-principles calculations. In the\nthird part we review a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon\ninteractions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron\nspectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.\n", "  The small background and the sensitivity to charged particles via a leading\norder loop coupling make the diphoton channel a privileged experimental test\nfor new physics models. We propose a simple archetypal scenario to generate a\nsharp di-photon resonance as a result of threshold enhancements in the\neffective coupling between a heavy pseudoscalar particle and new vector-like\nleptons. We therefore study three different scenarios consistent with the\ncurrent experimental limits and deviating from the Standard Model at the\n2~$\\sigma$ level. The model also introduces a natural dark matter candidate\nable to match the observed dark matter abundance and comfortably respect the\ncurrent direct detection constraints.\n", "  The quantum-classical transition in the Caldeira-Leggett model is\ninvestigated in the framework of the functional renormalization group method.\nIt is shown that a divergent quadratic term arises in the action due to the\nheat bath in the model. By removing the divergence with a frequency cutoff we\nconsidered the critical behavior of the model. The critical exponents belonging\nto the susceptibility and the correlation length are determined and their\nindependence of the frequency cutoff and the renormalization scheme is shown.\n", "  We give a simple derivation and explanation of a recently proposed new\nrelativistic interaction between the electron and the angular momentum of the\nelectromagnetic field in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Our derivation is based\non the work of Moller, who pointed out that, in special relativity, a particle\nwith spin must always have a finite extension. We generalize Mollers classical\nresult to the quantum regime and show that it leads to a new contribution to\nthe energy, which is the special relativistic interaction term. In addition, we\nshow that all spin terms arising from the Dirac equation may be obtained by\nthis method.\n", "  The bubble-assisted Liquid Hole-Multiplier (LHM) is a recently-introduced\ndetection concept for noble-liquid time projection chambers. In this \"local\ndual-phase\" detection element, a gas bubble is supported underneath a\nperforated electrode (e.g., Thick Gas Electron Multiplier - THGEM, or Gas\nElectron Multiplier - GEM). Electrons drifting through the holes induce large\nelectroluminescence signals as they pass into the bubble. In this work we\nreport on recent results of THGEM and GEM electrodes coated with cesium iodide\nand immersed in liquid xenon, allowing - for the first time - the detection of\nprimary VUV scintillation photons in addition to ionization electrons using\nLHMs.\n", "  Mean-field hydrodynamics advanced to clear explanations for the origin and\nproperties of the global meridional flow in stellar convection zones.\nQualitative arguments and analysis of basic equations both show that the\nmeridional circulation is driven by non-conservative centrifugal and buoyancy\nforces and results from a slight disbalance between these two drivers. The\ndeviations from the thermal wind balance are relatively large near the\nboundaries of convection zones. Accordingly, the meridional flow attains its\nlargest velocities in the boundary layers and decreases inside the convection\nzone. This picture, however, is neither supported nor dismissed by the\nconflicting results of recent helioseismic soundings or 3D numerical\nexperiments. The relevant physics of the differential temperature and its\npossible relation to the solar oblateness are briefly discussed.\n", "  We consider the coupled nonlinear Dirac equations (NLDE's) in 1+1 dimensions\nwith scalar-scalar self interactions $\\frac{ g_1^2}{2} ( {\\bpsi} \\psi)^2 +\n\\frac{ g_2^2}{2} ( {\\bphi} \\phi)^2 + g_3^2 ({\\bpsi} \\psi) ( {\\bphi} \\phi)$ as\nwell as vector-vector interactions of the form $\\frac{g_1^2 }{2} (\\bpsi\n\\gamma_{\\mu} \\psi)(\\bpsi \\gamma^{\\mu} \\psi)+ \\frac{g_2^2 }{2} (\\bphi\n\\gamma_{\\mu} \\phi)(\\bphi \\gamma^{\\mu} \\phi) + g_3^2 (\\bpsi \\gamma_{\\mu}\n\\psi)(\\bphi \\gamma^{\\mu} \\phi ). $ Writing the two components of the assumed\nsolitary wave solution of these equations in the form $\\psi = e^{-i \\omega_1 t}\n\\{R_1 \\cos \\theta, R_1 \\sin \\theta \\}$, $\\phi = e^{-i \\omega_2 t} \\{R_2 \\cos\n\\eta, R_2\\sin \\eta \\}$, and assuming that $ \\theta(x),\\eta(x)$ have the {\\it\nsame} functional form they had when $g_3$=0, which is an approximation\nconsistent with the conservation laws, we then find approximate analytic\nsolutions for $R_i(x)$ which are valid for small values of $g_3^2/ g_2^2 $ and\n$g_3^2/ g_1^2$. In the nonrelativistic limit we show that both of these coupled\nmodels go over to the same coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation for which\nwe obtain two exact pulse solutions vanishing at $x \\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$.\n", "  For any inhomogeneous compactly supported electromagnetic (EM) medium, it is\nshown that there exists an infinite set of linearly independent electromagnetic\nwaves which generate nearly vanishing scattered wave fields. If the\ninhomogeneous medium is coated with a layer of properly chosen conducting\nmedium, then the wave set is generated from the Maxwell-Herglotz approximation\nto the interior PEC or PMC eigenfunctions and depends only on the shape of the\ninhomogeneous medium. If no such a conducting coating is used, then the wave\nset is generated from the Maxwell-Herglotz approximation to the generalised\ninterior transmission eigenfunctions and depends on both the content and the\nshape of the inhomogeneous medium. We characterise the nearly non-scattering\nwave sets in both cases with sharp estimates. The results can be used to give a\nconceptual design of a novel shadowless lamp. The crucial ingredient is to\nproperly choose the source of the lamp so that nearly no shadow will be\nproduced by the surgeons operating under the lamp.\n", "  General tradeoff relations present in nonlocal correlations of bipartite\nsystems are studied, regardless of any specific quantum states and measuring\ndirections. Extensions to multipartite scenarios are possible and very\npromising. Tsirelson's bound can be derived out in particular. The close\nconnection with uncertainty relations is also presented and discussed.\n", "  ATLAS muon detector upgrades aim for increased acceptance for muon triggering\nand precision tracking and for improved rate capability of the muon chambers in\nthe high-background regions of the detector with increasing LHC luminosity. The\nsmall-diameter Muon Drift Tube (sMDT) chambers have been developed for these\npurposes. With half of the drift-tube diameter of the MDT chambers and\notherwise unchanged operating parameters, sMDT chambers share the advantages of\nthe MDTs, but have an order of magnitude higher rate capability and can be\ninstalled in detector regions where MDT chambers do not fit in. The chamber\nassembly methods have been optimized for mass production, minimizing\nconstruction time and personnel. Sense wire positioning accuracies of 5 ?micons\nhave been achieved in serial production for large-size chambers comprising\nseveral hundred drift tubes. The construction of new sMDT chambers for\ninstallation in the 2016/17 winter shutdown of the LHC and the design of sMDT\nchambers in combination with new RPC trigger chambers for replacement of the\ninner layer of the barrel muon spectrometer are in progress.\n", "  Small-diameter muon drift tube (sMDT) chambers with 15 mm tube diameter are a\ncost-effective technology for high-precision muon tracking over large areas at\nhigh background rates as expected at future high-energy hadron colliders\nincluding HL-LHC. The chamber design and construction procedures have been\noptimized for mass production and provide sense wire positioning accuracy of\nbetter than 10 ?m. The rate capability of the sMDT chambers has been\nextensively tested at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility. It exceeds the one\nof the ATLAS muon drift tube (MDT) chambers, which are operated at\nunprecedentedly high background rates of neutrons and gamma-rays, by an order\nof magnitude, which is sufficient for almost the whole muon detector acceptance\nat FCC-hh at maximum luminosity. sMDT operational and construction experience\nexists from ATLAS muon spectrometer upgrades which are in progress or under\npreparation for LHC Phase 1 and 2.\n", "  We discuss two semi-independent calibration techniques used to determine the\nin-flight radiometric calibration for the New Horizons' Multi-spectral Visible\nImaging Camera (MVIC). The first calibration technique compares the observed\nstellar flux to modeled values. The difference between the two provides a\ncalibration factor that allows the observed flux to be adjusted to the expected\nlevels for all observations, for each detector. The second calibration\ntechnique is a channel-wise relative radiometric calibration for MVIC's blue,\nnear-infrared and methane color channels using observations of Charon and\nscaling from the red channel stellar calibration. Both calibration techniques\nproduce very similar results (better than 7% agreement), providing strong\nvalidation for the techniques used. Since the stellar calibration can be\nperformed without a color target in the field of view and covers all of MVIC's\ndetectors, this calibration was used to provide the radiometric keywords\ndelivered by the New Horizons project to the Planetary Data System (PDS). These\nkeywords allow each observation to be converted from counts to physical units;\na description of how these keywords were generated is included. Finally,\nmitigation techniques adopted for the gain drift observed in the near-infrared\ndetector and one of the panchromatic framing cameras is also discussed.\n", "  A scalable 16-ch thermal neutron detection system has been developed in the\nframework of the upgrade of a neutron diffractometer. The detector is based on\nZnS:${}^6$LiF scintillator with embedded WLS fibers which are read out with\nSiPMs. In this paper, we present the 16-ch module, the dedicated readout\nelectronics, a direct comparison between the performance of the diffractometer\nobtained with the current ${}^3$He detector and with the 16-ch detection\nmodule, and the channel-to-channel uniformity.\n", "  Non-degenerate 2-photon excitation (ND-2PE) of a fluorophore with two laser\nbeams of different photon energies offers an independent degree of freedom in\ntuning of the photon flux for each beam. This feature takes advantage of the\ninfrared wavelengths used in 3-photon microscopy to achieve an increased\npenetration depth, while preserving a relatively high degenerate 2-photon\nexcitation (D-2PE) cross section, exceeding that achievable with 3-photon\nexcitation. Here, using spatially and temporally aligned Ti:Sapphire laser and\noptical parametric oscillator beams operating at near infrared (NIR) and\nshort-wavelength infrared (SWIR) optical frequencies, respectively, we provide\na practical demonstration that the emission intensity of a fluorophore excited\nin the non-degenerate regime in a scattering medium is more efficient than the\ncommonly used D-2PE.\n", "  In this paper, we construct thin-shell wormholes from regular Ayon-Beato and\nGarcia black hole by employing cut and paste formalism and examine their\nstability. We analyze attractive and repulsive characteristics of wormholes\ncorresponding to outward and inward-directed acceleration components,\nrespectively. A general equation of state is assumed as a linear perturbation\nto explore stability of these constructed wormholes with and without\ncosmological constant. We consider linear, logarithmic and Chaplygin gas models\nfor exotic matter and evaluate stability regions for different values of\ncharge. For horizon-free case, it is found that the generalized Chaplygin gas\nmodel provides maximum stable regions in de Sitter background while the\nmodified generalized Chaplygin gas and logarithmic gas yield maximum stable\nregions in anti-de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  We study microcanonical lattice gas models with long range interactions,\nincluding power law interactions. We rigorously obtain a variational principle\nfor the entropy. In a one dimensional example, we find a first order phase\ntransition by proving the entropy is non-differentiable along a certain curve.\n", "  The FCAL collaboration is preparing large scale prototypes of special\ncalorimeters to be used in the very forward region at a future linear electron\npositron collider for a precise and fast luminosity measurement and\nbeam-tuning. These calorimeters are designed as sensor-tungsten calorimeters\nwith very thin sensor planes to keep the Moliere radius small and dedicated FE\nelectronics to match the timing and dynamic range requirements. A partially\ninstrumented prototype was investigated in the CERN PS T9 beam in 2014 and at\nthe DESY-II Synchrotron in 2015. It was operated in a mixed particle beam\n(electrons, muons and hadrons) of 5 GeV from PS facilities and with secondary\nelectrons of 5 GeV energy from DESY-II. The results demonstrated a very good\nperformance of the full readout chain. The high statistics data were used to\nstudy the response to different particles, perform sensor alignment and measure\nthe longitudinal shower development in the sandwich. In addition, Geant4 MC\nsimulations were done, and compared to the data.\n", "  We introduce a notion of noncommutative Poisson-Nijenhuis structure on the\npath algebra of a quiver. In particular, we focus on the case when the Poisson\nbracket arises from a noncommutative symplectic form. The formalism is then\napplied to the study of the Calogero-Moser and Gibbons-Hermsen integrable\nsystems. In the former case, we give a new interpretation of the bihamiltonian\nreduction performed in [3].\n", "  The Quantum Heisenberg Ferromagnet can be naturally reformulated in terms of\ninteracting bosons (called spin waves or magnons) as an expansion in the\ninverse spin size. We calculate the first order interaction correction to the\nfree energy, as an upper bound in the limit where the spin size $S \\to \\infty$\nand $\\beta S$ is fixed ($\\beta$ being the inverse temperature). Our result is\nvalid in two and three spatial dimensions. We extrapolate our result to compare\nwith Dyson's low-temperature expansion. While our first-order correction has\nthe expected temperature dependance, in higher orders of the perturbation\ntheory cancellations are necessary.\n", "  In recent years we are witnessing a flourish in research aimed to facilitate\nalkali vapors in guided wave configurations. Owing to the significant reduction\nin device dimensions, the increase in density of states, the interaction with\nsurfaces and primarily the high intensities carried along the structure, a rich\nworld of light vapor interactions can be studied, and new functionalities, e.g.\nlow power nonlinear light-matter interactions can be achieved. One immense\nremaining challenge is to study the effects of quantum coherence and shifts in\nsuch nano-scale waveguides, characterized by ultra-small mode areas and fast\ndynamics. Here, we construct a serpentine silicon-nitride wave guide, having\natomic vapor as its cladding. The unprecedented mode volume of 5e-13 m^3\nsupported over a length of 17 mm is used to demonstrate efficient linear and\nnon-linear spectroscopy. Fascinating and important phenomena such as van der\nWaals shifts, dynamical stark shifts, and coherent effects such as strong\ncoupling (in the form of Autler Townes splitting) are all observed. The\nserpentine atomic cladding is a promising building block for a variety of light\nvapor experiments, as it offers a very small footprint, enables operation with\nrelatively low density of atoms and extremely strong confinement of light and\nvapor. As such it may be used for important applications, such as all optical\nswitching, frequency referencing, and magnetometry to name a few.\n", "  Here we show that there exist internal gravity waves that are inherently\nunstable, that is, they cannot exist in nature for a long time. The instability\nmechanism is a one-way (irreversible) harmonic-generation resonance that\npermanently transfers the energy of an internal wave to its higher harmonics.\nWe show that, in fact, there are countably infinite number of such unstable\nwaves. For the harmonic-generation resonance to take place, nonlinear terms in\nthe free surface boundary condition play a pivotal role, and the instability\ndoes not obtain for a linearly-stratified fluid if a simplified boundary\ncondition such as rigid lid or linear form is employed. Harmonic-generation\nresonance presented here also provides a mechanism for the transfer of the\nenergy of the internal waves to the higher-frequency part of the spectrum where\ninternal waves are more prone to breaking, hence losing energy to turbulence\nand heat and contributing to oceanic mixing.\n", "  I describe the long-standing search for a \"smoking-gun\" signal for the\nmanifestation of (scale-)chiral symmetry in nuclear interactions. It is\nprompted by Gerry Brown's last unpublished note, reproduced verbatim below, on\nthe preeminent role of pions and vector ($\\rho$,$\\omega$) mesons in providing a\nsimple and elegant description of strongly correlated nuclear interactions. In\nthis note written in tribute to Gerry Brown, I first describe a case of an\nunambiguous signal in axial-charge transitions in nuclei and then combine his\nideas with the more recent development on the role of hidden symmetries in\nnuclear physics. What transpires is the surprising conclusion that the\nLandau-Migdal fixed point interaction $G_0^\\prime$, the nuclear tensor forces\nand Brown-Rho scaling, all encoded in scale-invariant hidden local symmetry, as\nGerry put, \"run the show and make all forces equal.\"\n", "  We are interested in exploring interacting particle systems that can be seen\nas microscopic models for a particular structure of coupled transport flux\narising when different populations are jointly evolving. The scenarios we have\nin mind are inspired by the dynamics of pedestrian flows in open spaces and are\nintimately connected to cross-diffusion and thermo-diffusion problems holding a\nvariational structure. The tools we use include a suitable structure of the\nrelative entropy controlling TV-norms, the construction of Lyapunov functionals\nand particular closed-form solutions to nonlinear transport equations, a\nhydrodynamics limiting procedure due to Philipowski, as well as the\nconstruction of numerical approximates to both the continuum limit problem in\n2D and to the original interacting particle systems.\n", "  The use of CMOS Pixel Sensors (CPS) for high resolution and low material\nvertex detectors has been validated with the 2014 and 2015 physics runs of the\nSTAR-PXL detector at RHIC/BNL. This opens the door to the use of CPS for inner\ntracking devices, with 10-100 times larger sensitive area, which require\ntherefore a sensor design privileging power saving, response uniformity and\nrobustness. The 350 nm CMOS technology used for the STAR-PXL sensors was\nconsidered as too poorly suited to upcoming applications like the upgraded\nALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS), which requires sensors with one order of\nmagnitude improvement on readout speed and improved radiation tolerance. This\ntriggered the exploration of a deeper sub-micron CMOS technology, Tower-Jazz\n180 nm, for the design of a CPS well adapted for the new ALICE-ITS running\nconditions. This paper reports the R&D results for the conception of a CPS well\nadapted for the ALICE-ITS.\n", "  A two boundary quantum mechanics without time ordered causal structure is\nadvocated as consistent theory. The apparent causal structure of usual \"near\nfuture\" macroscopic phenomena is attributed to a cosmological asymmetry and to\nrules governing the transition between microscopic to macroscopic observations.\nOur interest is a heuristic understanding of the resulting macroscopic physics.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the heavy quark potential in\nthe backgrounds with hyperscaling violation. The metrics are covariant under a\ngeneralized Lifshitz scaling symmetry with the dynamical Lifshitz parameter $z$\nand hyperscaling violation exponent $\\theta$. We calculate the potential for a\ncertain range of $z$ and $\\theta$ and discuss how it changes in the presence of\nthe two parameters. Moreover, we add a constant electric field to the\nbackgrounds and study its effects on the potential. It is shown that the heavy\nquark potential depends on the non-relativistic parameters. Also, the presence\nof the constant electric field tends to increase the potential.\n", "  We study the role of the topology of the background space on the\none-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. To do so, we\nstudy the growth of balls on disordered 2D manifolds with random Riemannian\nmetrics, generated by introducing random perturbations to a base manifold. As\nbase manifolds we consider cones of different aperture angles $\\theta$,\nincluding the limiting cases of a cylinder ($\\theta=0$, which corresponds to an\ninterface with periodic boundary conditions) and a plane ($\\theta=\\pi/2$, which\ncorresponds to an interface with circular geometry). We obtain that in the\nformer case the radial fluctuations of the ball boundaries follow the\nTracy-Widom (TW) distribution of the largest eigenvalue of random matrices in\nthe Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (TW-GOE), while on cones with any aperture\nangle $\\theta\\neq 0$ fluctuations correspond to the TW-GUE distribution related\nwith the Gaussian unitary ensemble. We provide a topological argument to\njustify the relevance of TW-GUE statistics for cones, and state a conjecture\nwhich relates the KPZ universality subclass with the background topology.\n", "  The upgrade of the LHCb experiment, scheduled for LHC Run-III, scheduled to\nstart in 2021, will transform the experiment to a trigger-less system reading\nout the full detector at 40 MHz event rate. All data reduction algorithms will\nbe executed in a high-level software farm enabling the detector to run at\nluminosities of $2\\times10^{33} \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n  The Vertex Locator (VELO) is the silicon vertex detector surrounding the\ninteraction region. The current detector will be replaced with a hybrid pixel\nsystem equipped with electronics capable of reading out at 40 MHz. The upgraded\nVELO will provide fast pattern recognition and track reconstruction to the\nsoftware trigger. The silicon pixel sensors have $55\\times55 \\mu m^{2}$ pitch,\nand are read out by the VeloPix ASIC, from the Timepix/Medipix family. The\nhottest region will have pixel hit rates of 900 Mhits/s yielding a total data\nrate of more than 3 Tbit/s for the upgraded VELO. The detector modules are\nlocated in a separate vacuum, separated from the beam vacuum by a thin custom\nmade foil. The foil will be manufactured through milling and possibly thinned\nfurther by chemical etching.\n  The material budget will be minimised by the use of evaporative CO$_2$\ncoolant circulating in microchannels within 400 $\\mu m$ thick silicon\nsubstrates. The current status of the VELO upgrade is described and latest\nresults from operation of irradiated sensor assemblies are presented.\n", "  We discuss the automatised calculation of the Higgs mass in renormalisable\nsupersymmetric models with complex parameters at the two-loop level. Our setup\nis based on the public codes SARAH and SPheno, which can now compute the\ntwo-loop corrections to masses of all neutral scalars in such theories. The\ngeneric ansatz for these calculations and the handling of the `Goldstone Boson\ncatastrophe' is described. It is shown that we find perfect agreement with\nother existing two-loop calculations performed in the DR-bar scheme. We also\nuse the functionality to derive results for the MSSM and NMSSM not available\nbefore: the Higgs mass in the constrained version of the complex MSSM, and the\nimpact of CP phases in the two-loop corrections beyond order alpha-strong\nalpha-top for the scale invariant NMSSM are briefly analysed.\n", "  The formulation for zero mode of a Bose-Einstein condensate beyond the\nBogoliubov approximation at zero temperature [Y.Nakamura et al., Phys. Rev. A\n89, 013613 (2014)] is extended to finite temperature. Both thermal and quantum\nfluctuations are considered in a manner consistent with a concept of\nspontaneous symmetry breakdown for a finite-size system. Therefore, we need a\nproper treatment of the zero mode operators, which invoke non-trivial\nenhancements in depletion condensate and thermodynamical quantities such as the\nspecific heat. The enhancements are visible in the weak interaction case. Our\napproach reproduces the results of a homogeneous system in the Bogoliubov\napproximation in a large particle number limit.\n", "  We discuss certain generalization of the Hilbert space of states in\nnoncommutaive quantum mechanics that, as we show, introduces magnetic monopoles\ninto the theory. Such generalization arises very naturally in the considered\nmodel, but can be easily reproduced in ordinary quantum mechanics as well. This\napproach offers a different viewpoint on the Dirac quantization condition and\nother important relations for magnetic monopoles. We focus mostly on the\nkinematic structure of the theory, but investigate also a dynamical problem\n(with the Coulomb potential).\n", "  The cooperative behavior of quantum impurities on 2D materials, such as\ngraphene and bilayer graphene, is characterized by a non-trivial competition\nbetween screening (Kondo effect), and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\nmagnetism. In addition, due to the small density of states at the Fermi level,\nimpurities may not couple to the conduction electrons at all, behaving as free\nmoments. Employing a recently developed {\\em{exact}} numerical method to study\nmulti-impurity lattice systems, we obtain non-perturbative results that\ndramatically depart from expectations based on the conventional RKKY theory. At\nhalf-filling and for weak coupling, impurities remain in the local moment\nregime when they are on opposite sublattices, up to a critical value of the\ninteractions when they start coupling anti-ferromagnetically with correlations\nthat decay very slowly with inter-impurity distance. At finite doping, away\nfrom half-filling, ferromagnetism is completely absent and the physics is\ndominated by a competition between anti-ferromagnetism and Kondo effect. In\nbilayer graphene, impurities on opposite layers behave as free moments, unless\nthe interaction is of the order of the hopping or larger.\n", "  The periodic-orbit theory based on the improved stationary-phase method\nwithin the phase-space path integral approach is presented for the\nsemiclassical description of the nuclear shell structure, concerning the main\ntopics of the fruitful activity of V. G. Solovjov. We apply this theory to\nstudy bifurcations and symmetry breaking phenomena in a radial power-law\npotential which is close to the realistic Woods-Saxon one up to about the Fermi\nenergy. Using the realistic parametrization of nuclear shapes we explain the\norigin of the double-humped fission barrier and the asymmetry in the fission\nisomer shapes by the bifurcations of periodic orbits. The semiclassical origin\nof the oblate-prolate shape asymmetry and tetrahedral shapes is also suggested\nwithin the improved periodic-orbit approach. The enhancement of shell\nstructures at some surface diffuseness and deformation parameters of such\nshapes are explained by existence of the simple local bifurcations and new\nnon-local bridge-orbit bifurcations in integrable and partially integrable\nFermi systems. We obtained good agreement between the semiclassical and quantum\nshell-structure components of the level density and energy for several surface\ndiffuseness and deformation parameters of the potentials, including their\nsymmetry breaking and bifurcation values.\n", "  Using scalar-vector-tensor Brans Dicke (VBD) gravity [3] in presence of self\ninteraction BD potential $V(\\phi)$ and perfect fluid matter field action we\nsolve corresponding field equations via dynamical system approach for flat\nFriedmann Robertson Walker metric (FRW). We obtained 3 type critical points for\n$\\Lambda CDM$ vacuum de Sitter era where stability of our solutions are\ndepended to choose particular values of BD parameter $\\omega.$ One of these\nfixed points is supported by a constant potential which is stable for\n$\\omega<0$ and behaves as saddle (quasi stable) for $\\omega\\geq0.$ Two other\nones are supported by a linear potential $V(\\phi)\\sim\\phi$ which one of them is\nstable for $\\omega=0.27647.$ For a fixed value of $\\omega$ there is at least 2\nout of 3 critical points reaching to a unique critical point. Namely for\n$\\omega=-0.16856(-0.56038)$ the second (third) critical point become unique\nwith the first critical point. In dust and radiation eras we obtained 1\ncritical point which never become unique fixed point. In the latter case\ncoordinates of fixed points are also depended to $\\omega.$ To determine\nstability of our solutions we calculate eigenvalues of Jacobi matrix of 4D\nphase space dynamical field equations for de Sitter, dust and radiation eras.\nWe should be point also potentials which support dust and radiation eras must\nbe similar to $V(\\phi)\\sim\\phi^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $V(\\phi)\\sim\\phi^{-1}$\nrespectively. In short our study predicts that radiation and dust eras of our\nVBD-FRW cosmology transmit to stable de Sitter state via non-constant potential\n(effective variable cosmological parameter) by choosing $\\omega=0.27647$.\n", "  We derive a novel computational scheme for functional Renormalization Group\n(fRG) calculations for interacting fermions on 2D lattices. The scheme is based\non the exchange parametrization fRG for the two-fermion interaction, with\nadditional insertions of truncated partitions of unity. These insertions\ndecouple the fermionic propagators from the exchange propagators and lead to a\nseparation of the underlying equations. We demonstrate that this separation is\nnumerically advantageous and may pave the way for refined, large-scale\ncomputational investigations even in the case of complex multiband systems.\nFurthermore, on the basis of speedup data gained from our implementation, it is\nshown that this new variant facilitates efficient calculations on a large\nnumber of multi-core CPUs. We apply the scheme to the $t$,$t'$ Hubbard model on\na square lattice to analyze the convergence of the results with the bond length\nof the truncation of the partition of unity. In most parameter areas, a fast\nconvergence can be observed. Finally, we compare to previous results in order\nto relate our approach to other fRG studies.\n", "  Numerical study has been conducted for the chaotic flow in a multi-turn\nclosed-loop pulsating heat pipe (PHP). Heat flux and constant temperature\nboundary conditions have been applied for heating and cooling sections\nrespectively. Water was used as working fluid. Volume of Fluid (VOF) method has\nbeen employed for two-phase flow simulation. Volume fraction results showed\nformation of perfect vapor and liquid plugs in the fluid flow of PHP.\nNon-linear time series analysis, power spectrum density, correlation dimension\nand autocorrelation function were used to investigate the chaos. Absence of\ndominating peaks in the power spectrum density was a signature of chaos in the\npulsating heat pipe. It was found that by increasing the filling ratio and\nevaporator heating power the correlation dimension increases. Decreasing of the\nautocorrelation function with respect to time showed the prediction ability is\nfinite as a result of chaotic state. An optimal filling ratio of 60% and\nminimum thermal resistance of 1.62 K/W were found for better thermal\nperformance of the pulsating heat pipe.\n", "  The dynamics of individual DNA molecules in semidilute solutions undergoing\nplanar extensional flow is simulated using a multi-particle Brownian dynamics\nalgorithm, which incorporates hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions in\nthe context of a coarse-grained bead-spring chain model for DNA. The successive\nfine-graining protocol [1, 2], in which simulation data acquired for\nbead-spring chains with increasing values of the number of beads $N_b$, is\nextrapolated to the number of Kuhn steps $N_\\text{K}$ in DNA (while keeping key\nphysical parameters invariant), is used to obtain parameter-free predictions\nfor a range of Weissenberg numbers and Hencky strain units. A systematic\ncomparison of simulation predictions is carried out with the experimental\nobservations of [3], who have recently used single molecule techniques to\ninvestigate the dynamics of dilute and semidilute solutions of $\\lambda$-phage\nDNA in planar extensional flow. In particular, they examine the response of\nindividual chains to step-strain deformation followed by cessation of flow,\nthereby capturing both chain stretch and relaxation in a single experiment. The\nsuccessive fine-graining technique is shown to lead to quantitatively accurate\npredictions of the experimental observations in the stretching and relaxation\nphases. Additionally, the transient chain stretch following a step strain\ndeformation is shown to be much smaller in semidilute solutions than in dilute\nsolutions, in agreement with experimental observations.\n", "  The Bargmann-Fock representation of the Rabi Hamiltonian is expressed by a\nsystem of two coupled first-order differential equations in the complex field,\nwhich may be rewritten in a canonical form under the Birkhoff transformation.\nThe transformation gives rise to leapfrog recurrence relations, from which the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors could be obtained. The interesting feature of this\napproach is that it generates integer quantum numbers, which relate the\nsolutions to the Juddian baselines. The relationship with Braak's integrability\nclaim [PRL 107, 100401 (2011)] is discussed\n", "  While the vast majority of calculations reported on molecular conductance\nhave been based on the static non-equilibrium Green's function formalism\ncombined with density functional theory, in recent years a few time-depedent\napproaches to transport have started to emerge. Among these, the driven\nLiouville-von Neumann equation (J. Chem. Phys. 124, 214708 (2006)) is a simple\nand appealing route relying on a tunable rate parameter, which has been\nexplored in the context of semi-empirical methods. In the present study, we\nadapt this formulation to a density functional theory framework and analyze its\nperformance. In particular, it is implemented in an efficient all-electron DFT\ncode with Gaussian basis functions, suitable for quantum-dynamics simulations\nof large molecular systems. At variance with the case of the tight-binding\ncalculations reported in the literature, we find that now the initial\nperturbation to drive the system out of equilibrium plays a fundamental role in\nthe stability of the electron dynamics, and that the equation of motion used in\nprevious tight-binding implementations has to be modified to conserve the total\nnumber of particles during time propagation. Moreover, we propose a procedure\nto get rid of the dependence of the current-voltage curves on the rate\nparameter. This method is employed to obtain the current-voltage characteristic\nof saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons of different lenghts, with very\npromising prospects.\n", "  In most biological tissues, light scattering due to small differences in\nrefractive index limits the depth of optical imaging systems. Two-photon\nmicroscopy (2PM), which significantly reduces the scattering of the excitation\nlight, has emerged as the most common method to image deep within scattering\nbiological tissue. This technique, however, requires high-power pulsed lasers\nthat are both expensive and difficult to integrate into compact portable\nsystems. In this paper, using a combination of theoretical and experimental\ntechniques, we show that Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) can\nimage nearly as deep as 2PM without the need for a high-powered pulsed laser.\nCompared to other single photon imaging techniques like epifluorescence and\nconfocal microscopy, SPIM can image more than twice as deep in scattering media\n(approximately 10 times the mean scattering length). These results suggest that\nSPIM has the potential to provide deep imaging in scattering media in\nsituations where 2PM systems would be too large or costly.\n", "  For the metallic nanoparticles, smaller than the free electron path, an\nimpact of the particle's surface on the nonlocal effects emerging is shown.\nLight-induced current inside the particle begins to depend on the spatial\nderivatives of the field that leads to modification of Maxwell's equations.\nConsequently, the results of Mie theory as well as definitions of the\ndielectric function and optical conductivity should be revisited. For the\nsphere-shaped nanoparticle, the explicit expression for the high-frequency\ncurrent with account of nonlocality is obtained. The dependence of the nonlocal\ncontribution on the light frequency and particle's size is discussed.\n", "  We study the connection between the observed star formation rate-stellar mass\n(SFR-$M_*$) relation and the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) by\nmeans of a Subhalo Abundance Matching technique coupled to merger trees\nextracted from a N-body simulation. Our approach, which considers both galaxy\nmergers and stellar stripping, is to force the model to match the observed SMF\nat redshift $z>2$, and let it evolve down to the present time according to the\nobserved (SFR-$M_*$) relation. In this study, we use two different sets of SMFs\nand two SFR-$M_*$ relations: a simple power law and a relation with a\nmass-dependent slope. Our analysis shows that the evolution of the SMF is more\nconsistent with a SFR-$M_*$ relation with a mass-dependent slope, in agreement\nwith predictions from other models of galaxy evolution and recent observations.\nIn order to fully and realistically describe the evolution of the SMF, both\nmergers and stellar stripping must be considered, and we find that both have\nalmost equal effects on the evolution of SMF at the massive end. Taking into\naccount the systematic uncertainties in the observed data, the high-mass end of\nthe SMF obtained by considering stellar stripping results in good agreement\nwith recent observational data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). At\n$\\log M_* < 11.2$, our prediction at z=0.1 is close to \\citet{li-white09} data,\nbut the high-mass end ($\\log M_* > 11.2$) is in better agreement with\n\\citet{dsouza15} data which account for more massive galaxies.\n", "  Direct searches for lepton flavour violation in decays of the Higgs and $Z$\nbosons with the ATLAS detector at the LHC are presented. The following three\ndecays are considered: $H\\to e\\tau$, $H\\to\\mu\\tau$, and $Z\\to\\mu\\tau$. The\nsearches are based on the data sample of proton--proton collisions collected by\nthe ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$\nat a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. No significant excess is\nobserved, and upper limits on the lepton-flavour-violating branching ratios are\nset at the 95% confidence level: Br$(H\\to e\\tau) <$ 1.04%, Br$(H\\to\\mu\\tau) <$\n1.43%, and Br$(Z\\to\\mu\\tau) <$ 1.69 $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$.\n", "  A kinetic mixing term, which generalizes the duality symmetry of Dirac, is\nstudied in a theory with two photons (visible and hidden). This theory can be\neither CP conserving or CP violating depending on the transformation of fields\nin the hidden sector. However if CP is violated, it necessarily occurs in the\nhidden sector. This opens up an interesting possibility of new sources of CP\nviolation.\n", "  Recently (PRL 113, 050403 (2014)) the concept of local symmetries in\none-dimensional stationary wave propagation has been shown to lead to a class\nof invariant two-point currents that allow to generalize the parity and Bloch\ntheorem. In the present work we establish the theoretical framework of local\nsymmetries for higher-dimensional interacting many-body systems. Based on the\nBogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy we derive the equations\nof motion of local symmetry correlators which are off-diagonal elements of the\nreduced one-body density matrix at symmetry related positions. The natural\norbital representation yields equations of motion for the convex sum of the\nlocal symmetry correlators of the natural orbitals as well as for the local\nsymmetry correlators of the individual orbitals themselves. An alternative\nintegral representation with a unique interpretation is provided. We discuss\nspecial cases, such as the bosonic and fermionic mean field theory and show in\nparticular that the invariant two-point currents are recovered in the case of\nthe non-interacting one-dimensional stationary wave propagation. Finally we\nderive the equations of motion for anomalous local symmetry correlators which\nindicate the breaking of a global into a local symmetry in the stationary\nnon-interacting case.\n", "  In this work we introduce contact Hamiltonian mechanics, an extension of\nsymplectic Hamiltonian mechanics, and show that it is a natural candidate for a\ngeometric description of non-dissipative and dissipative systems. For this\npurpose we review in detail the major features of standard symplectic\nHamiltonian dynamics and show that all of them can be generalized to the\ncontact case.\n", "  Based on modern quantum measurement theory, we use Zurek's \"triple model\" to\nstudy, from the viewpoint of quantum information theory, the wave and particle\nnature of a photon in a symmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In the process\nof quantum measurement, the state of both the system and the detector is not an\nentangled state but a correlated state. We find that the information gain about\nthe photon is related to the correlations (including classical and quantum\ncorrelations) between the photon and the detector. We also derive the\nrelationship between the information gain and the fringe visibility. We find\nthat the classical correlations remain consistent with the path\ndistinguishability and can be used to describe the particle-like property of\nthe photon. Quantum correlations are not exactly the same as fringe visibility,\nbut both can represent the quantum coherence of the photon. Finally, we provide\nan analytical expression for quantum correlations of one type of two-qubit\nseparable states.\n", "  The so-called Whitham equation arises in the modeling of free surface water\nwaves, and combines a generic nonlinear quadratic term with the exact linear\ndispersion relation for gravity waves on the free surface of a fluid with\nfinite depth.\n  In this work, the effect of incorporating capillarity into the Whitham\nequation is in focus. The capillary Whitham equation is a nonlocal equation\nsimilar to the usual Whitham equation, but containing an additional term with a\ncoefficient depending on the Bond number T which measures the relative strength\nof capillary and gravity effects on the wave motion.\n  A spectral collocation scheme for computing approximations to periodic\ntraveling waves for the capillary Whitham equation is put forward. Numerical\napproximations of periodic traveling waves are computed using a bifurcation\napproach, and a number of bifurcation curves are found. Our analysis uncovers a\nrich structure of bifurcation patterns, including subharmonic bifurcations, as\nwell as connecting and crossing branches. Indeed, for some values of the Bond\nnumber T, the bifurcation diagram features distinct branches of solutions which\nintersect at a secondary bifurcation point. The same branches may also cross\nwithout connecting, and some bifurcation curves feature self-crossings without\nself-connections.\n", "  By studying the development of shock waves out of discontinuity waves, in\n1954 P. Lax discovered a class of PDEs, which he called 'completely\nexceptional', where such a transition does not occur after a finite time. A\nstraightforward integration of the completely exceptionality conditions allowed\nBoillat to show that such PDEs are actually of Monge-Ampere type. In this\npaper, we first recast these conditions in terms of characteristics, and then\nwe show that the completely exceptional PDEs, with 2 or 3 independent\nvariables, can be described in terms of the conformal geometry of the\nLagrangian Grassmannian, where they are naturally embedded. Moreover, for an\narbitrary number of independent variables, we show that the space of r-th\ndegree sections of the Lagrangian Grassmannian can be resolved via a BGG\noperator. In the particular case of 1st degree sections, i.e., hyperplane\nsections or, equivalently, Monge-Ampere equations, such operator is a close\nanalog of the trace-free second fundamental form.\n", "  We consider a class of diffusion problems defined on simple graphs in which\nthe populations at any two vertices may be averaged if they are connected by an\nedge. The diffusion polytope is the convex hull of the set of population\nvectors attainable using finite sequences of these operations. A number of\nphysical problems have linear programming solutions taking the diffusion\npolytope as the feasible region, e.g. the free energy that can be removed from\nplasma using waves, so there is a need to describe and enumerate its extreme\npoints. We review known results for the case of the complete graph $K_n$, and\nstudy a variety of problems for the path graph $P_n$ and the cyclic graph\n$C_n$. We describe the different kinds of extreme points that arise, and\nidentify the diffusion polytope in a number of simple cases. In the case of\nincreasing initial populations on $P_n$ the diffusion polytope is topologically\nan $n$-dimensional hypercube.\n", "  Dislocation core properties of tin (\\beta-Sn) were investigated using the\nsemi-discrete variational Peierls-Nabarro model (SVPN). The SVPN model, which\nconnects the continuum elasticity treatment of the long-range strain field\naround a dislocation with an approximate treatment of the dislocation core, was\nemployed to calculate various core properties, including the core energetics,\nwidths, and Peierls stresses for different dislocation structures. The role of\ncore energetics and properties on dislocation character and subsequent slip\nbehavior in \\beta-Sn was investigated. For instance, this work shows that a\nwidely spread dislocation core on the {110} plane as compared to dislocations\non the {100} and {101} planes. Physically, the narrowing or widening of the\ncore will significantly affect the mobility of dislocations as the Peierls\nstress is exponentially related to the dislocation core width in \\beta-Sn. In\ngeneral, the Peierls stress for the screw dislocation was found to be orders of\nmagnitude higher than the edge dislocation, i.e., the more the edge component\nof a mixed dislocation, the greater the dislocation mobility (lower the Peierls\nstress). The largest Peierls stress observed was 365 MPa for the dislocation on\nthe {101} plane. Furthermore, from the density plot, we see a double peak for\nthe 0deg (screw) and 30deg dislocations which suggests the dissociation of\ndislocations along these planes. Thus, for the {101} <-101> slip system, we\nobserved dislocation dissociation into three partials with metastable states.\nOverall, this work provides qualitative insights that aid in understanding the\nplastic deformation in \\beta-Sn.\n", "  The hypothesis of a PeVatron in the Galactic Center, emerged with the recent\n{\\gamma}-ray measurements of H.E.S.S., motivates the search for neutrinos from\nthis source. The effect of {\\gamma}-ray absorption is studied: at the energies\ncurrently probed, the known background radiation fields lead to small effects,\nwhereas it is not possible to exclude large effects due to new IR radiation\nfields near the very Center. Precise upper limits on neutrino fluxes are\nderived and the underlying hypotheses are discussed. The expected number of\nevents for ANTARES, IceCube and KM3NeT, based on the H.E.S.S. measurements, are\ncalculated. It is shown that km3-class telescopes in the Northern hemisphere\nhave the potential of observing high-energy neutrinos from this important\nastronomical object and can check the existence of a hadronic PeV galactic\naccelerator.\n", "  Hydrodynamics analysis of waves in two-dimensional degenerate electron gas\nwith the account of separate spin evolution is presented. The transverse\nelectric field is included along with the longitudinal electric field. The\nCoulomb exchange interaction is included in the analysis. In contrast with the\nthree-dimensional plasma-like mediums the contribution of the transverse\nelectric field is small. We show the decrease of frequency of both the\nextraordinary (Langmuir) wave and the spin-electron acoustic wave due to the\nexchange interaction. Moreover, spin-electron acoustic wave has negative\ndispersion at the relatively large spin-polarization. Corresponding dispersion\ndependencies are presented and analyzed.\n", "  We study the expected sensitivity to measure the branching ratio of Higgs\nboson decays to invisible particles at a future circular \\epem collider\n(FCC-ee) in the process $e^+e^-\\to HZ$ with $Z\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-$ ($\\ell=e$ or\n$\\mu$) using an integrated luminosity of 3.5 ab$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass\nenergy $\\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV. The impact of the energy spread of the FCC-ee beam\nand of the resolution in the reconstruction of the leptons is discussed. %Two\ndifferent detector concepts are considered: a detector corresponding to the CMS\nreconstruction performances and the expected design of the ILC detector. The\nminimum branching ratio for a $5\\sigma$ observation after 3.5ab$^{-1}$ of data\ntaking is $1.7\\pm 0.1\\%(stat+syst) $. The branching ratio exclusion limit at\n95\\% CL is $0.63 \\pm 0.22\\%((stat+syst))$.\n", "  The ATLAS experiment will undergo a major upgrade of the tracker system in\nview of the high luminosity phase of the LHC (HL-LHC) foreseen to start around\n2025. Thin planar pixel modules are promising candidates to instrument the new\npixel system, thanks to the reduced contribution to the material budget and\ntheir high charge collection efficiency after irradiation. New designs of the\npixel cells, with an optimized biasing structure, have been implemented in\nn-in-p planar pixel productions with sensor thicknesses of 270 um. Using beam\ntests, the gain in hit efficiency is investigated as a function of the received\nirradiation fluence. The outlook for future thin planar pixel sensor\nproductions will be discussed, with a focus on thin sensors with a thickness of\n100 and 150 um and a novel design with the optimized biasing structure and\nsmall pixel cells (50 um x 50 um and 25 um x 100 um). These dimensions are\nforeseen for the new ATLAS read-out chip in 65 nm CMOS technology and the fine\nsegmentation will represent a challenge for the tracking in the forward region\nof the pixel system at HL-LHC. To predict the performance of 50 um x 50 um\npixels at high eta, FE-I4 compatible planar pixel sensors have been studied\nbefore and after irradiation in beam tests at high incidence angle with respect\nto the short pixel direction. Results on cluster shapes, charge collection- and\nhit efficiency will be shown.\n", "  The in-medium modifications of hadron properties such as masses and decay\nwidths have been a major focus of the scientific work of Gerry Brown and the\ninsights gained by him and his collaborators made them major drivers of this\nfield for several decades. Their prediction of experimental signals in\ndi-lepton pair production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions were\ninstrumental in initiating large experimental campaigns which continue until\ntoday. In this chapter we review recent results which elucidate the relation of\nhadronic spectral properties at finite temperature and density to the\nrestoration of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.\n", "  We consider a modification of the OMM energy functional which contains an\n$\\ell^1$ penalty term in order to find a sparse representation of the low-lying\neigenspace of self-adjoint operators. We analyze the local minima of the\nmodified functional as well as the convergence of the modified functional to\nthe original functional. Algorithms combining soft thresholding with gradient\ndescent are proposed for minimizing this new functional. Numerical tests\nvalidate our approach. As an added bonus, we also prove the unanticipated and\nremarkable property that every local minimum the OMM functional without the\n$\\ell^1$ term is also a global minimum.\n", "  In the present study we search for a new stellar model with spherically\nsymmetric matter and charged distribution under general relativistic framework.\nThe model represents a compact star of embedding class one. The solutions\nobtain here are general in their nature having the following two features:\nfirstly, the metric becomes flat and also the expressions for the pressure,\nenergy density and electric charge become zero in all the cases if we consider\nthe constant $A=0$, which shows that our solutions represent the so-called\n`electromagnetic mass model' \\cite{Lorentz1904}, and secondly, the metric\nfunction $\\nu(r)$, for the limit $n$ tends to infinity, converts to\n$\\nu(r)=C{r}^{2}+ ln~B$, which is the same as considered by Maurya et al.\n\\cite{Maurya2015a}. We have investigated several physical aspects of the model\nand find that all the features are acceptable within the demand of the\ncontemporary theoretical studies and observational evidences.\n", "  We compute the quotient of the self-duality equation for conformal metrics by\nthe action of the diffeomorphism group. We also determine Hilbert polynomial,\ncounting the number of independent scalar differential invariants depending on\nthe jet-order, and the corresponding Poincar\\'e function. We describe the field\nof rational differential invariants separating generic orbits of the\ndiffeomorphism pseudogroup action, resolving the local recognition problem for\nself-dual conformal structures.\n", "  Quantum evolution of a two-spin system with anisotropic Heisenberg\nHamiltonian in the magnetic field is considered. We show that this evolution\nhappens on some manifold with geometry depending on the ratio between the\ninteraction couplings and on the initial state. The Fubini-Study metric of this\nmanifold is calculated. The entanglement of the states belonging to this\nmanifold is examined. Also we investigate similar problem for a two-spin system\ndescribed by the Dzyaloshinsky-Moria Hamiltonian. The problem is solved using\nthe fact that this Hamiltonian and the anisotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian are\nlinked by the unitary transformation.\n", "  A commentary is made on the recent work by Cardy, ArXiv:1603. 08267, on\nquantum revivals and higher dimensional CFT. The actual expressions used here\nare those derived some time ago. The calculation is extended to fermion fields\nfor which the power spectrum involves the odd divisor function. Comments are\nmade on the equivalence of operator counting and eigenvalue methods, which is\nquickly verified. An explanation of the rational revivals for odd spheres is\ngiven in terms of wrongly quantised fields.\n", "  Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based on CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB structures is of\ngreat interest due to its application in the spin-transfer-torque magnetic\nrandom access memory (STT-MRAM). Large interfacial perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA) is required to achieve high thermal stability. Here we use\nfirst-principles calculations to investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy\n(MAE) of MgO/CoFe/capping layer structures, where the capping materials include\n5d metals Hf, Ta, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au and 6p metals Tl, Pb, Bi. We demonstrate\nthat it is feasible to enhance PMA by using proper capping materials.\nRelatively large PMA is found in the structures with capping materials of Hf,\nTa, Os, Ir and Pb. More importantly, the MgO/CoFe/Bi structure gives rise to\ngiant PMA (6.09 mJ/m2), which is about three times larger than that of the\nMgO/CoFe/Ta structure. The origin of the MAE is elucidated by examining the\ncontributions to MAE from each atomic layer and orbital. These findings provide\na comprehensive understanding of the PMA and point towards the possibility to\nachieve advanced-node STT-MRAM with high thermal stability.\n", "  Quantum mechanical weak values of projection operators have been used to\nanswer which-way questions, e.g. to trace which arms in a multiple Mach-Zehnder\nsetup a particle may have traversed from a given initial to a prescribed final\nstate. I show that this procedure might lead to logical inconsistencies in the\nsense that different methods used to answer composite questions, like Has the\nparticle traversed the way X or the way Y? , may result in different answers\ndepending on which methods are used to find the answer. I illustrate the\nproblem by considering some examples: the quantum pigeonhole framework of\nAharonov et al, the three-box problem, and Hardys paradox. To prepare the\nground for my main conclusion on the incompatibility in certain cases of weak\nvalues and logic, I study the corresponding situation for strong/projective\nmeasurements. In this case, no logical inconsistencies occur provided one is\nalways careful in specifying exactly to which ensemble or sample space one\nrefers. My results cast doubts on the utility of quantum weak values in\ntreating cases like the examples mentioned.\n", "  We demonstrate the measurement of laterally induced optical forces using an\nAtomic Force Microscope (AFM). The lateral electric field distribution between\na gold coated AFM probe and a nano-aperture in a gold film is mapped by\nmeasuring the lateral optical force between the apex of the AFM probe and the\nnano-aperture. Torsional eigenmodes of an AFM cantilever probe were used to\ndetect the laterally induced optical forces. We engineered the cantilever shape\nusing a focused ion beam to enhance the torsional eigenmode resonance. The\nmeasured lateral optical force agrees well with simulations. This technique can\nbe extended to simultaneously detect both lateral and longitudinal optical\nforces at the nanoscale by using an AFM cantilever as a multichannel detector.\nThis will enable simultaneous Photon Induced Force Microscopy (PIFM) detection\nof molecular responses with different incident field polarizations. The\ntechnique can be implemented on both cantilever and tuning fork based AFMs.\n", "  The [NII] 122 and 205 \\mu m transitions are powerful tracers of the ionized\ngas in the interstellar medium. By combining data from 21 galaxies selected\nfrom the Herschel KINGFISH and Beyond the Peak surveys, we have compiled 141\nspatially resolved regions with a typical size of ~1 kiloparsec, with\nobservations of both [NII] far-infrared lines. We measure [NII] 122/205 line\nratios in the ~0.6-6 range, which corresponds to electron gas densities\n$n_e$~1-300 cm$^{-3}$, with a median value of $n_e$=30 cm$^{-3}$. Variations in\nthe electron density within individual galaxies can be as a high as a factor of\n~50, frequently with strong radial gradients. We find that $n_e$ increases as a\nfunction of infrared color, dust-weighted mean starlight intensity, and star\nformation rate surface density ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$). As the intensity of the [NII]\ntransitions is related to the ionizing photon flux, we investigate their\nreliability as tracers of the star formation rate (SFR). We derive relations\nbetween the [NII] emission and SFR in the low-density limit and in the case of\na log-normal distribution of densities. The scatter in the correlation between\n[NII] surface brightness and $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ can be understood as a property of\nthe $n_e$ distribution. For regions with $n_e$ close to or higher than the\n[NII] line critical densities, the low-density limit [NII]-based SFR\ncalibration systematically underestimates the SFR since [NII] emission is\ncollisionally quenched. Finally, we investigate the relation between [NII]\nemission, SFR, and $n_e$ by comparing our observations to predictions from the\nMAPPINGS-III code.\n", "  We consider the SU(3)-equivariant dimensional reduction of gauge theories on\nspaces of the form $M^d \\times X_{1,1}$ with d-dimensional Riemannian manifold\n$M^d$ and the Aloff-Wallach space $X_{1,1}$= SU(3)/U(1) endowed with its\nSasaki-Einstein structure. The condition of SU(3)-equivariance of vector\nbundles, which has already occurred in the studies of Spin(7)-instantons on\ncones over Aloff-Wallach spaces, is interpreted in terms of quiver diagrams,\nand we construct the corresponding quiver bundles, using (parts of) the weight\ndiagram of SU(3). We consider three examples thereof explicitly and then\ncompare the results with the quiver gauge theory on $Q_3$ =SU(3)/(U(1) x U(1)),\nthe leaf space underlying the Sasaki-Einstein manifold $X_{1,1}$. Moreover, we\nstudy instanton solutions on the metric cone $C(X_{1,1})$ by evaluating the\nHermitian Yang-Mills equation. We briefly discuss some features of the moduli\nspace thereof, following the main ideas of a treatment of Hermitian Yang-Mills\ninstantons on cones over generic Sasaki-Einstein manifolds in the literature.\n", "  We calculate the single-particle nucleon characteristics in symmetric nuclear\nmatter with inclusion of the 3N interactions. The contribution of the 3N forces\nto the nucleon self energies are expressed in terms of the nonlocal scalar\ncondensate (d=3) and of the configuration of the two four-quark condensates\n(d=6) in which two diquark operators act on two different nucleons of the\nmatter. The most important part of the contribution of the four-quark\ncondensate is calculated in a model-independent way. We employed a relativistic\nquark model of nucleon for calculation of the rest part. The density dependence\nof the vector and scalar nucleon self energies and of the single-particle\npotential energy are obtained.\n", "  Spin-to-orbital-angular-momentum conversion has attracted considerable\ninterest as a tool to create exotic light beams, leading to the emergence of\nnovel devices that implement this function. These converters exploit the\ngeometrical phase to create helical beams of handedness determined by the\nchirality of the incident light. This property is finding important\napplications in quantum optics thanks to the demonstration of liquid crystal\nspin-to-orbital angular momentum converters (SOC) known as q-plates. Here we\ndemonstrate high-efficiency SOCs in the visible based on dielectric\nmetasurfaces that generate vortex beams with high and even fractional\ntopological charge and show for the first time the simultaneous generation of\ncollinear helical beams with different and arbitrary orbital angular momentum.\nWe foresee that this versatile method of creating vortex beams, which\ncircumvents the limitations of q-plates, will significant impact microscopy and\nvector beam shaping.\n", "  This paper describes the data acquisition system used for data readout from a\nsegmented detector of reactor antineutrinos with active shielding. Theoretical\napproach to the data acquisition is described and two possible solutions using\nQDCs and digitizers are discussed. Also described are the results of the DAQ\nperformance during routine data taking operation of DANSS. DANSS (Detector of\nthe reactor AntiNeutrino based on Solid Scintillator) is a project aiming to\nmeasure a spectrum of reactor antineutrinos using inverse beta decay (IBD) in a\nplastic scintillator. The detector is located close to an industrial nuclear\nreactor core and is covered by passive and active shielding. It is expected to\nhave about 15000 IBD interactions per day. Light from the detector is sensed by\nPMT and SiPM.\n", "  We develop a theory of nonlocal homogenization for metamaterial consisting of\nparallel metallic wires with dielectric coating. It is demonstrated that\nmanipulation of dielectric contrast between wire dielectric shell and host\nmaterial results in switching of metamaterial dispersion regime from elliptic\nto the hyperbolic one, i.e. the topological transition takes place. We confirm\nour theoretical predictions by full-wave numerical simulations.\n", "  We determine the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters from a study\nof atmospheric neutrinos in a magnetised detector such as the ICAL at the\nproposed India-based Neutrino Observatory. In such a detector that can {\\em\nseparately} count $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\overline{\\nu}_\\mu$-induced events, the\nrelatively smaller (about 5\\%) uncertainties on the neutrino--anti-neutrino\nflux ratios translate to a constraint in the $\\chi^2$ analysis that results in\na significant improvement in the precision with which neutrino oscillation\nparameters such as $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ can be determined. Such an effect is\nunique to all magnetisable detectors and constitutes a great advantage in\ndetermining neutrino oscillation parameters using such detectors. Such a study\nhas been performed for the first time here. Along with an increase in the\nkinematic range compared to earlier analyses, this results in sensitivities to\noscillation parameters in the 2--3 sector that are comparable to or better than\nthose from accelerator experiments where the fluxes are significantly higher.\nFor example, the $1\\sigma$ precisions on $\\sin^2\\theta_{23}$ and\n$|\\Delta{m^2_{32(31)}}|$ achievable for 500 kTon yr exposure of ICAL are\n$\\sim9\\%$ and $\\sim2.5\\%$ respectively for both normal and inverted\nhierarchies. The mass hierarchy sensitivity achievable with this combination\nwhen the true hierarchy is normal (inverted) for the same exposure is\n$\\Delta\\chi^2\\approx8.5$ ($\\Delta\\chi^2\\approx9.5$).\n", "  Correlation boxes are hypothetical systems capable of producing the maximal\nalgebraic violation of Bell inequalities, beyond the quantum bound and without\nsuperluminal signaling. The fact that these systems show stronger correlations\nthan those presented by maximally entangled quantum states has been regarded as\na demonstration that the former are more nonlocal than the latter. By employing\nan alternative, consistent measure of nonlocality, we show that this conclusion\nis not necessarily true. In addition, we find a class of correlation boxes that\nare less nonlocal than the quantum singlet with respect to the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, being, at the same time, more nonlocal\nwith respect to the 3322 inequality.\n", "  The observed mass-to-light ($M/L$) ratios of a large sample of GCs in M31\nshow an inverse trend with metallicity compared to what is expected from Simple\nStellar Population (SSP) models with an invariant canonical stellar IMF, in the\nsense that the observed $M/L$ ratios decrease with increasing metallicity. We\nshow that incorporating the effect of dynamical evolution the SSP models with a\ncanonical IMF can not explain the decreasing $M/L$ ratios with increasing\nmetallicity for the M31 GCs. The recently derived top-heavy IMF as a function\nof metallicity and embedded cluster density is proposed to explain the lower\nthan expected $M/L$ ratios of metal-rich GCs. We find that the SSP models with\na top-heavy IMF, retaining a metallicity- and cluster mass- dependent fraction\nof the remnants within the clusters, and taking standard dynamical evolution\ninto account can successfully explain the observed $M/L-[Fe/H]$ relation of M31\nGCs. Thus we propose that the kinematical data of GCs can be used to constrain\nthe top-heaviness of the IMF in GCs.\n", "  We give a qualitative explanation of the analog of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU)\nrecurrence in a one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE).\nThat recurrence can be considered as a result of the nonlinear development of\nmodulation instability. All known exact localized solitons-type solutions\ndescribing propagation on the background of the modulationally unstable\ncondensate show the recurrence to the condensate state after its interaction\nwith solitons. The condensate state locally recovers its original form with the\nsame amplitude but a different phase after soliton leave its initial region.\nThis is the analog of the FPU recurrence for the NLSE. Based on the\nintegrability of the NLSE, we demonstrate that the FPU recurrence takes place\nnot only for condensate but for more general solution in the form of the\ncnoidal wave. This solution is periodic in space and can be represented as a\nsolitonic lattice. That lattice reduces to isolated soliton solution in the\nlimit of large distance between solitons. The lattice transforms into the\ncondensate in the opposite limit of dense soliton packing. The cnoidal wave is\nalso modulationally unstable due to soliton overlapping. This instability at\nthe linear stage does not provide the cnoidal wave recurrence. The recurrence\nhappens at the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability. From the\npractical point of view the latter property is very important, especially for\nthe fiber communication systems which use soliton as an information carrier.\n", "  We present an improved statistical method for calculation of mean lifetime of\nnuclei in a decay chain with uncertain relation between mother and daughter\nnuclei. The method is based on formation of time distribution of intervals\nbetween mother and daughter nuclei, without trying to set the exact\nmother-daughter nuclei relationship. If there is a coincidence of mother and\ndaughter nuclei decays, sum of these distributions has flat term on which an\nexponential term is superimposed. Parameters of this exponential function allow\nlifetime of daughter nucleus to be extracted. The method is tested on Monte\nCarlo simulation data.\n", "  We present the Mathematica package E6Tensors, a tool for explicit tensor\ncalculations in E6 gauge theories. In addition to matrix expressions for the\ngroup generators of E6, it provides structure constants, various higher rank\ntensors and expressions for the representations 27, 78, 351 and 351'. This\npaper comes along with a short manual including physically relevant examples. I\nfurther give a complete list of gauge invariant, renormalisable terms for\nsuperpotentials and Lagrangians.\n", "  Hopf algebra methods are applied to study Drinfeld twists of\n(3+1)-diffeomorphisms and deformed general relativity on \\emph{commutative}\nmanifolds. A classical nonlocality length scale is produced above which\nmicrocausality emerges. Matter fields are utilized to generate self-consistent\nAbelian Drinfeld twists in a background independent manner and their continuous\nand discrete symmetries are examined. There is negligible experimental effect\non the standard model of particles. While baryonic twist producing matter would\nbegin to behave acausally for rest masses above $\\sim1-10$ TeV, other\npossibilities are viable dark matter candidates or a right handed neutrino.\nFirst order deformed Maxwell equations are derived and yield immeasurably small\ncosmological dispersion and produce a propagation horizon only for photons at\nor above Planck energies. This model incorporates dark matter without any\nappeal to extra dimensions, supersymmetry, strings, grand unified theories,\nmirror worlds, or modifications of Newtonian dynamics.\n", "  We present a new approach to describe hydrodynamics carrying non-Abelian\nmacroscopic degrees of freedom. Based on the Kaluza-Klein compactification of a\nhigher-dimensional neutral dissipative fluid on a group manifold, we obtain a\nd=4 colored dissipative fluid coupled to Yang-Mills gauge field. We calculate\nthe transport coefficients of the new fluid, which show the non-Abelian\ncharacter of the gauge group. In particular, we obtain group-valued terms in\nthe gradient expansions and response quantities such as the conductivity matrix\nand the chemical potentials. While using SU(2) for simplicity, this approach is\napplicable to any gauge group. Resulting a robust description of non-Abelian\nhydrodynamics, we discuss some links between this system and quark-gluon plasma\nand fluid/gravity duality.\n", "  We derive positivity bounds for scattering amplitudes of particles with\narbitrary spin using unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry. The bounds\nimply the positivity of certain low-energy coefficients of the effective action\nthat controls the dynamics of the light degrees of freedom. We show that\nlow-energy amplitudes strictly softer than $O(p^4)$ do not admit unitary\nultraviolet completions unless the theory is free. This enforces a bound on the\nenergy growth of scattering amplitudes in the region of validity of the\neffective theory. We discuss explicit examples including the Goldstino from\nspontaneous supersymmetry breaking, and the theory of a spin-1/2 fermion with a\nshift symmetry.\n", "  Forming the product of two geometric spaces is one of the most basic\noperations in geometry, but in the spectral-triple formulation of\nnon-commutative geometry, the standard prescription for taking the product of\ntwo real spectral triples is problematic: among other drawbacks, it is\nnon-commutative, non-associative, does not transform properly under unitaries,\nand often fails to define a proper spectral triple. In this paper, we explain\nthat these various problems result from using the ungraded tensor product; by\nswitching to the graded tensor product, we obtain a new prescription where all\nof the earlier problems are neatly resolved: in particular, the new product is\ncommutative, associative, transforms correctly under unitaries, and always\nforms a well defined spectral triple.\n", "  We propose a protocol to dissipatively cool a room temperature mechanical\nresonator using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center ensemble. The spin ensemble is\ncoupled to the resonator through its orbitally-averaged excited state, which\nhas a spin-strain interaction that has not been previously characterized. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that the spin-strain coupling in the excited state\nis $13.5\\pm0.5$ times stronger than the ground state spin-strain coupling. We\nthen theoretically show that this interaction combined with a high-density spin\nensemble enables the cooling of a mechanical resonator from room temperature to\na fraction of its thermal phonon occupancy.\n", "  The fractional quantum Hall effect at $\\nu=2+3/8$, which has been\ndefinitively observed, is one of the last fractions for which no viable\nexplanation has so far been demonstrated. Our detailed study suggests that it\nbelongs to a new class of of exotic states described by the\nBonderson-Slingerland wave function. Its excitations are non-Abelian anyons\nsimilar to those of the well studied Pfaffian state at 5/2, but its wave\nfunction has a more complex structure. Using the effective edge theory, we make\npredictions for various measurable quantities that should enable a confirmation\nof the underlying topological order of this state.\n", "  Energy levels, Land\\'{e} $g$-factors and radiative lifetimes are reported for\nthe lowest 182 levels of the 3d$^4$, 3d$^3$4s and 3d$^3$4p configurations of\nFe~V, Co~VI and Ni~VII. Additionally, radiative rates ($A$-values) have been\ncalculated for the E1, E2 and M1 transitions among these levels. The\ncalculations have been performed in a quasi-relativistic approach (QR) with a\nvery large {\\em configuration interaction} (CI) wavefunction expansion, which\nhas been found to be necessary for these ions. Our calculated energies for all\nions are in excellent agreement with the available measurements, for most\nlevels. Discrepancies among various calculations for the radiative rates of E1\ntransitions in Fe~V are up to a factor of two for stronger transitions ($f \\geq\n0.1$), and larger (over an order of magnitude) for weaker ones. The reasons for\nthese discrepancies have been discussed and mainly are due to the differing\namount of CI and methodologies adopted. However, there are no appreciable\ndiscrepancies in similar data for M1 and E2 transitions, or the $g$-factors for\nthe levels of Fe~V, the only ion for which comparisons are feasible.\n", "  Charged particle beams are used in Particle Therapy (PT) to treat oncological\npatients due to their selective dose deposition in tissues and to their high\nbiological effect in killing cancer cells with respect to photons and electrons\nused in conventional radiotherapy. Nowadays, protons and carbon ions are used\nin PT clinical routine but, recently, the interest on the potential application\nof helium and oxygen beams is growing due to their reduced multiple scattering\ninside the body and increased linear energy transfer, relative biological\neffectiveness and oxygen enhancement ratio. The precision of PT demands for\nonline dose monitoring techniques, crucial to improve the quality assurance of\ntreatments. The beam range confined in the irradiated target can be monitored\nthanks to the neutral or charged secondary radiation emitted by the\ninteractions of hadron beams with matter. Prompt photons are produced by\nnuclear de-excitation processes and, at present, different dose monitoring and\nbeam range verification techniques based on the prompt {\\gamma} detection have\nbeen proposed. It is hence of importance to perform the {\\gamma} yield\nmeasurement in therapeutical-like conditions. In this paper we report the\nyields of prompt photons produced by the interaction of helium, carbon and\noxygen ion beams with a PMMA target. The measurements were performed at the\nHeidelberg Ion-beam Therapy center (HIT) with beams of different energies. A\nLYSO scintillator has been used as photon detector. The obtained {\\gamma}\nyields for $^{12}$C ion beams are compared with results from literature, while\nno other results from $^{4}$He and $^{16}$O beams have been published yet. A\ndiscussion on the expected resolution of a slit camera detector is presented,\ndemonstrating the feasibility of a prompt-{\\gamma} based monitoring technique\nfor PT treatments using helium, carbon and oxygen ion beams.\n", "  We study generic types of holographic matter residing in Lifshitz invariant\ndefect field theory as modeled by adding probe D-branes in the bulk black hole\nspacetime characterized by dynamical exponent $z$ and with hyperscaling\nviolation exponent $\\theta$. Our main focus will be on the collective\nexcitations of the dense matter in the presence of an external magnetic field.\nConstraining the defect field theory to 2+1 dimensions, we will also allow the\ngauge fields become dynamical and study the properties of a strongly coupled\nanyonic fluid. We will deduce the universal properties of holographic matter\nand find that the Einstein relation always holds.\n", "  We present the light-curves and spectra of 24 afterglows that have been\nmonitored by Fermi-LAT at 0.1-100 GeV over more than a decade in time. All\nlight-curves (except 130427) are consistent with a single power-law starting\nfrom their peaks, which occurred, in most cases, before the burst end. The\nlight-curves display a brightness-decay rate correlation, with all but one\n(130427) of the bright afterglows decaying faster than the dimmer afterglows.\nWe attribute this dichotomy to a quick deposition of the relativistic ejecta\nenergy in the external-shock for the brighter/faster-decaying afterglows and to\nan extended energy-injection in the afterglow shock for the\ndimmer/slower-decaying light-curves. The spectra of six afterglows (090328,\n100414, 110721, 110731, 130427, 140619B) indicate the existence of a harder\ncomponent above a spectral dip/ankle at energy 0.3-3 GeV, offering evidence for\nan inverse-Compton emission at higher energies, and suggesting that the harder\npower-law spectra of five other LAT afterglows (130327B, 131231, 150523,\n150627, 160509) could also be inverse-Compton, while the remaining softer LAT\nafterglows should be synchrotron. Marginal evidence for a spectral break and\nsoftening at higher energies is found for two afterglows (090902B and 090926).\n", "  The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on board Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)\nmade $> 10^{8}$ measurements of the reflectivity of Mars at 1064 nm\n($R_{1064}$) by both active sounding and passive radiometry. Past studies of\n$R_{1064}$ neglected the effects of atmospheric opacity and viewing geometry on\nboth active and passive measurements and also identified a potential\ncalibration issue with passive radiometry. Therefore, as yet, there exists no\nacceptable reference $R_{1064}$ to derive a column opacity product for\natmospheric studies and planning future orbital lidar observations. Here, such\na reference $R_{1064}$ is derived by seeking $R^{M,N}_{1064}$: a\nMinnaert-corrected normal albedo under clear conditions and assuming minimal\nphase angle dependence. Over darker surfaces, $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ and the absolute\nlevel of atmospheric opacity were estimated from active sounding. Over all\nsurfaces, the opacity derived from active sounding was used to exclude passive\nradiometry measurements made under opaque conditions and estimate\n$R^{M,N}_{1064}$. These latter estimates then were re-calibrated by comparison\nwith $R^{M,N}$ derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations over\nareas of approximately uniform reflectivity. Estimates of $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ from\nre-calibrated passive radiometry typically agree with HST observations within\n10%. The resulting $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ is then used to derive and quantify the\nuncertainties of a column opacity product, which can be applied to\nmeteorological and climatological studies of Mars, particularly to detect and\nmeasure mesoscale cloud/aerosol structures.\n", "  Trapped inflation has been proposed to provide a successful inflation with a\nsteep potential. We discuss the formation of primordial black holes in the\ntrapped inflationary scenario. We show that primordial black holes are\nnaturally produced during inflation with a steep trapping potential. In\nparticular, we have given a recipe for an inflaton potential with which\nparticle production can induce large non-Gaussian curvature perturbation that\nleads to the formation of high stellar-mass primordial black holes. These\nprimordial black holes could be dark matter observed by the LIGO detectors\nthrough a binary black-hole merger. At the end, we have given an attempt to\nrealize the required inflaton potential in the axion monodromy inflation, and\ndiscussed the gravitational waves sourced by the particle production.\n", "  Knowing the dispersion regime (normal vs anomalous) is important for both an\nisolated waveguide and a waveguide array. We investigate by the Finite Element\nMethod the dispersion properties of a LiNbO3 waveguides array using two\ntechniques. The first one assumes the Coupled Mode Theory in a 2-waveguide\nsystem. The other one uses the actual diffraction curve determined in a\n7-waveguide system. In both approaches we find that by decreasing the array\nperiod, one passes from normal dispersion by achromatic point to anomalous\narray dispersion. We then illustrate the wavelength separation by doing\nRunge-Kutta light propagation simulations in waveguide array. As all the\nparameters values are technologically feasible, this opens new possibilities\nfor optical data processing.\n", "  Dark matter may interact with Standard Model (SM) particle through the\nexchange of a massive spin-2 graviton producing signals that can be detected.\nIn this work we examine the $\\gamma$-ray emission signals, including the line\nemission and the continuous spectrum component in such a massive\ngraviton-mediated dark matter model. The constraints of LHC data, dark matter\nrelic density as well as the dark matter indirect detection data have been\napplied to narrow down the parameter space. We focus on the vector dark matter\nmodel which could produce detectable $\\gamma$-ray line signal. It is found that\nthe $\\gamma$-ray line data is effective on constraining the model parameters\nand the ongoing and upcoming space or ground-based $\\gamma$-ray experiments can\nconstrain the model further.\n  As for the continuous $\\gamma$-ray emission, the total effective annihilation\ncross section is $\\sim 10^{-26} {\\rm cm^{3}~s^{-1}}$ except at the region where\ndark matter mass is around the graviton mass or half of it, which is consistent\nwith current observational data and will be reliably probed by the upcoming\nCTA.\n", "  This paper presents the design, implementation and validation of the software\nalignment procedure used to perform geometric calibration of the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter with respect to the tracking system of the SND\ndetector which is taking data at the VEPP-2000 e^{+}e^{-}collider (BINP,\nNovosibirsk). This procedure is based on the mathematical model describing the\nrelative calorimeter position. The parameter values are determined by\nminimizing a \\chi^{2} function using the difference between particle directions\nreconstructed in these two subdetectors for e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\nscattering events. The results of the calibration applied to data and MC\nsimulation fit the model well and give an improvement in particle\nreconstruction. They are used in data reconstruction and MC simulation.\n", "  A 2-stage hybrid model is proposed that joins the fast initial state of\ninteraction, described by the hadron string dynamics (HSD) model, to subsequent\nevolution of the expanding system at the second stage, treated within ideal\nhydrodynamics. The developed hybrid model is assigned to describe heavy-ion\ncollisions in the energy range of the NICA collider under construction in\nDubna. Generally, the model is in reasonable agreement with the available data\non proton rapidity spectra. However, reproducing proton rapidity spectra, our\nhybrid model cannot describe the rapidity distributions of pions. The model\nshould be improved by taking into consideration viscosity effects at the\nhydrodynamical stage of system evolution.\n", "  We investigate the quantum many-body instabilities for electrons on the\nhoneycomb lattice at half-filling with extended interactions, motivated by a\ndescription of graphene and related materials. We employ a recently developed\nfermionic functional Renormalization Group scheme which allows for highly\nresolved calculations of wavevector dependences in the low-energy effective\ninteractions. We encounter the expected anti-ferromagnetic spin density wave\nfor a dominant on-site repulsion between electrons, and charge order with\ndifferent modulations for dominant pure $n$-th nearest neighbor repulsive\ninteractions. Novel instabilities towards incommensurate charge density waves\ntake place when non-local density interactions among several bond distances are\nincluded simultaneously. Moreover, for more realistic Coulomb potentials in\ngraphene including enough non-local terms there is a suppression of charge\norder due to competition effects between the different charge ordering\ntendencies, and if the on-site term fails to dominate, the semi-metallic state\nis rendered stable. The possibility of a topological Mott insulator being the\nfavored tendency for dominating second nearest neighbor interactions is not\nrealized in our results with high momentum resolution.\n", "  We study the gravitational action induced by coupling two-dimensional\nnon-conformal, massive matter to gravity on a compact Riemann surface. We\nexpress this gravitational action in terms of finite and well-defined\nquantities for any value of the mass. A small-mass expansion gives back the\nLiouville action in the massless limit, the Mabuchi and Aubin-Yau actions to\nfirst order, as well as an infinite series of higher-order contributions\nwritten in terms of purely geometric quantities.\n", "  This paper proposes an approach of the unified consideration of classical and\nquantum mechanics from the standpoint of the complex analysis effects. It turns\nout that quantization can be interpreted in terms of the Riemann surface\ncorresponding to the multivalent $\\operatorname{Ln}\\Psi $ function. A visual\ninterpretation of \"trajectories\" of the quantum system and of the Feynman's\npath integral is presented. A magnetic dipole having a magnetic charge that\nsatisfies the Dirac quantization rule was obtained.\n", "  Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS), based on\nlaser-pump/X-ray probe method, is powerful in capturing the change of\ngeometrical and electronic structure of the absorbing atom upon excitation.\nTR-XAS data analysis is generally performed on the laser-on minus laser-off\ndifference spectrum. Here we present a new analysis scheme for the TR-XAS\ndifference fitting in both the Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)\nand the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) region. R-space EXAFS\ndifference fitting could quickly give main quantitative structure change of the\nfirst shell and provide reliable constraint on the range of the variables in\nXANES fit. XANES fitting part introduces global non-derivative optimization\nalgorithm and optimizes the local structure change in a flexible way where both\nthe core XAS calculation package and the search method in the fitting shell are\nchangeable. The scheme was applied to the TR-XAS difference analysis of\nFe(phen)3 spin crossover complex and yielded the reliable distance change and\nthe excitation population.\n", "  A decomposition of the energy and helicity fluxes in a turbulent hydrodynamic\nflow is proposed. The decomposition is based on the projection of the flow to a\nhelical basis that allows to investigate separately the role of interactions\namong modes of different helicity. The proposed formalism is then applied in\nlarge scale numerical simulations of a non-helical and a helical flow, where\nthe decomposed fluxes are explicitly calculated. It is shown that the total\nenergy flux can be split in to three fluxes that independently remain constant\nin the inertial range. One of these fluxes that corresponds to the interactions\nof fields with the same helicity is negative implying the presence of an\ninverse cascade that is `hidden' inside the forward cascade. Similar to the\nenergy flux the helicity flux is also shown that it can be decomposed to two\nfluxes that remain constant in the inertial range. Implications of these\nresults as well possible new directions for investigations are discussed.\n", "  We construct an ensemble distribution to describe steady immiscible two-phase\nflow of two incompressible fluids in a porous medium. The system is found to be\nergodic. The distribution is used to compute macroscopic flow parameters. In\nparticular, we find an expression for the overall mobility of the system from\nthe ensemble distribution. The entropy production at the scale of the porous\nmedium is shown to give the expected product of the average flow and its\ndriving force, obtained from a black-box description. We test numerically some\nof the central theoretical results.\n", "  A new technique of elucidating $\\beta$-decay schemes of isotopes with large\ndensity of states at low excitation energies has been developed, in which a\nBroad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector is used in conjunction with coaxial\nhyper-pure germanium detectors. The power of this technique has been\ndemonstrated on the example of 183Hg decay. Mass-separated samples of 183Hg\nwere produced by a deposition of the low-energy radioactive-ion beam delivered\nby the ISOLDE facility at CERN. The excellent energy resolution of the BEGe\ndetector allowed $\\gamma$ rays energies to be determined with a precision of a\nfew tens of electronvolts, which was sufficient for the analysis of the\nRydberg-Ritz combinations in the level scheme. The timestamped structure of the\ndata was used for unambiguous separation of $\\gamma$ rays arising from the\ndecay of 183Hg from those due to the daughter decays.\n", "  Various methods have been developed independently to study the\nmultifractality of measures in many different contexts. Although they all\nconvey the same intuitive idea of giving a \"dimension\" to sets where a quantity\nscales similarly within a space, they are not necessarily equivalent on a more\nrigorous level. This review article aims at unifying the multifractal\nmethodology by presenting the multifractal theoretical framework and principal\npractical methods, namely the moment method, the histogram method, multifractal\ndetrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA) and modulus maxima wavelet transform\n(MMWT), with a comparative and interpretative eye.\n", "  The Simplified Modal Method (SMM) provides a quick and intuitive way to\nanalyze the performance of gratings of rectangular shapes. For non-rectangular\nshapes, a version of SMM has been developed, but it applies only to the\nLittrow-mounting incidence case and it neglects reflection. Here, we use the\ntheory of mode-coupling in a tapered waveguide to improve SMM so that it\napplies to non-rectangular gratings at arbitrary angles of incidence. Moreover,\nthis new 'Tapered Simplified Modal Method' (TSMM) allows us to properly account\nfor reflected light. We present here the analytical development of the theory\nand numerical simulations, demonstrating the validity of the method.\n", "  We propose the characterization of fragmentation functions by the energy\nfraction x, a hadron takes away from the energy of the jet measured in the\nframe co-moving with the jet. Besides, we propose the usage of the jet mass as\nthe fragmentation scale Q. We show that these two Lorentz-invariant variables\nemerge naturally in a microcanonical ensemble with conserved fourmomentum.\nThen, we construct a statistical hadronisation model, in which, two features of\nthe hadronic final states in various high-energy reactions (power law spectra\nand negative-binomial multiplicity distributions) can be connected simply.\nFinally, we analyse the scale dependence of the parameters of the model (power\nof the spectrum and mean energy per hadron) in the phi^3 theory. Fitting\nfragmentation functions in diffractive positron-proton collisions, we obtain a\nprediction for the jet mass dependence of the hadron multiplicity distribution\ninside jets.\n", "  Indications of a discrepancy between simulations and data on the number of\nmuons in cosmic ray (CR) showers exist over a large span of energies. We focus\nin particular on the excess of multi-muon bundles observed by the DELPHI\ndetector at LEP and on the excess in the muon number in general reported by the\nPierre Auger Observatory. Even though the primary CR energies relevant for\nthese experiments differ by orders of magnitude, we can find a single mechanism\nwhich can simultaneously increase predicted muon counts for both, while not\nviolating constraints from accelerators or from the longitudinal shower\ndevelopment as observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory. We present a brief\ntheoretical motivation and describe a practical implementation of such a model,\nbased on the addition of soft particles to interactions above a chosen energy\nthreshold. Results of an extensive set of simulations show the behavior of this\nmodel in various parts of a simplified parameter space.\n", "  The in-place growth of suspended carbon nanotubes facilitates the observation\nof both unperturbed electronic transport spectra and high-Q vibrational modes.\nFor complex structures integrating, e.g., superconducting rf elements on-chip,\nselection of a chemically and physically resistant material that survives the\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) process provides a challenge. We demonstrate\nthe implementation of molybdenum-rhenium coplanar waveguide resonators that\nexhibit clear resonant behaviour at cryogenic temperatures even after having\nbeen exposed to nanotube growth conditions. The properties of the MoRe devices\nbefore and after CVD are compared to a reference niobium device.\n", "  We present the first installation and characterization of a phased array feed\n(PAF) on the 64 m Parkes radio telescope. The combined system operates best\nbetween 0.8 GHz and 1.74 GHz where the beamformed noise temperature is between\n45 K and 60 K, the aperture efficiency ranges from 70% to 80%, and the\neffective field of view is 1.4 deg$^2$ at 1310 MHz. After a 6-month trial\nobserving program at Parkes, the PAF will be installed on the 100 m antenna at\nEffelsberg. This is the first time a PAF has been installed on a large\nsingle-antenna radio telescope and made available to astronomers.\n", "  We study two families of (matrix versions of) generalized Volterra (or\nBogoyavlensky) lattice equations. For each family, the equations arise as\nreductions of a partial differential-difference equation in one continuous and\ntwo discrete variables, which is a realization of a general integrable equation\nin bidifferential calculus. This allows to derive a binary Darboux\ntransformation and also self-consistent source extensions via general results\nof bidifferential calculus. Exact solutions are constructed from the simplest\nseed solutions.\n", "  There is ongoing debate regarding the mechanism of swift heavy ion track\nformation in CaF2. The objective of this study is to shed light on this\nimportant topic using a range of complimentary experimental techniques.\nEvidence of the threshold for ion track formation being below 3 keV/nm is\nprovided by both transmission electron microscopy and Rutherford backscattering\nspectroscopy in the channeling mode which has direct consequences for the\nvalidity of models describing the response of CaF2 to swift heavy ion\nirradiation. Advances in the TEM and RBS/c analyses presented here pave the way\nfor better understanding of the ion track formation.\n", "  We report the discovery of EPIC201702477b, a transiting brown dwarf in a long\nperiod (40.73691 +/- 0.00037 day) and eccentric (e=0.2281 +/- 0.0026) orbit.\nThis system was initially reported as a planetary candidate based on two\ntransit events seen in K2 Campaign 1 photometry and later validated as an\nexoplanet. We confirm the transit and refine the ephemeris with two subsequent\nground-based detections of the transit using the LCOGT 1m telescope network. We\nrule out any transit timing variations above the level of 30s. Using high\nprecision radial velocity measurements from HARPS and SOPHIE we identify the\ntransiting companion as a brown dwarf with a mass, radius, and bulk density of\n66.9 +/- 1.7 M$_J$, 0.757 +/- 0.065 R$_J$, and 191+/-51 g.cm$^{-3}$\nrespectively. EPIC201702477b is the smallest radius brown dwarf yet discovered,\nwith a mass just below the H-burning limit. It has the highest density of any\nplanet, substellar mass object or main-sequence star discovered so far. We find\nevidence in the set of known transiting brown dwarfs for two populations of\nobjects - high mass brown dwarfs and low mass brown dwarfs. The higher-mass\npopulation have radii in very close agreement to theoretical models, and show a\nlower-mass limit around 60 M$_J$. This may be the signature of mass-dependent\nejection of systems during the formation process.\n", "  Bifurcation theory and continuation methods are well-established tools for\nthe analysis of nonlinear mechanical systems subject to periodic forcing. We\nillustrate the added value and the complementary information provided by\nsingularity theory with one distinguished parameter. While tracking\nbifurcations reveals the qualitative changes in the behaviour, tracking\nsingularities reveals how structural changes are themselves organised in\nparameter space. The complementarity of that information is demonstrated in the\nanalysis of detached resonance curves in a two-degree-of-freedom system.\n", "  Escherichia coli swims using flagella activated by rotary motors. The\ndirection of rotation of the motors is indirectly regulated by the binding of a\nsingle messenger protein. The conformational spread model has been shown to\naccurately describe the equilibrium properties as well as the dynamics of the\nflagellar motor. In this paper we study this model from an analytic point of\nview. By exploiting the separation of timescales observed in experiments, we\nshow how to reduce the conformational spread model to a coarse-grained,\ncooperative binding model. We show that this simplified model reproduces very\nwell the dynamics of the motor switch.\n", "  An investigation on stochastic deflection of high-energy negatively charged\nparticles in a bent crystal was carried out. On the basis of analytical\ncalculation and numerical simulation it was shown that it exists a maximum\nangle at which most of the beam is deflected. The existence of a maximum, which\nis taken in the correspondence of the optimal radius of curvature, is a novelty\nwith respect to the case of positively charged particles, for which the\ndeflection angle can be freely increased by increasing the crystal length. This\ndifference has to be ascribed to the stronger contribution of incoherent\nscattering affecting the dynamics of negative particles that move closer to\natomic nuclei and electrons. We therefore identified the ideal parameters for\nthe exploitation of axial confinement for negatively charged particle beam\nmanipulation in future high-energy accelerators, e.g., ILC or muon colliders.\n", "  We propose to relate dark matter stability to the possible Dirac nature of\nneutrinos. The idea is illustrated in a simple scheme where small Dirac\nneutrino masses arise from a type--I seesaw mechanism as a result of a $Z_4$\ndiscrete lepton number symmetry. The latter implies the existence of a viable\nWIMP dark matter candidate, whose stability arises from the same symmetry which\nensures the Diracness of neutrinos.\n", "  We apply the liquid droplet model to describe the clustering phenomenon in\nSU(2) gluodynamics, especially, in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase\ntransition. In particular, we analyze the size distributions of clusters formed\nby the Polyakov loops of the same sign. Within such an approach this phase\ntransition can be considered as the transition between two types of liquids\nwhere one of the liquids (the largest droplet of a certain Polyakov loop sign)\nexperiences a condensation, while the other one (the next to largest droplet of\nopposite Polyakov loop sign) evaporates. The clusters of smaller sizes form two\naccompanying gases, and their size distributions are described by the liquid\ndroplet parameterization. By fitting the lattice data we have extracted the\nvalue of Fisher exponent $\\tau =$ 1.806 $\\pm$ 0.008. Also we found that the\ntemperature dependences of the surface tension of both gaseous clusters are\nentirely different below and above the phase transition and, hence, they can\nserve as an order parameter. The critical exponents of the surface tension\ncoefficient in the vicinity of the phase transition are found. Our analysis\nshows that the temperature dependence of the surface tension coefficient above\nthe critical temperature has a $T^2$ behavior in one gas of clusters and $T^4$\nin the other one.\n", "  Strictly subadditive, subadditive and weakly subadditive labelings of quivers\nwere introduced by the second author, generalizing Vinberg's definition for\nundirected graphs. In our previous work we have shown that quivers with\nstrictly subadditive labelings are exactly the quivers exhibiting Zamolodchikov\nperiodicity. In this paper, we classify all quivers with subadditive labelings.\nWe conjecture them to exhibit a certain form of integrability, namely, as the\n$T$-system dynamics proceeds, the values at each vertex satisfy a linear\nrecurrence. Conversely, we show that every quiver integrable in this sense is\nnecessarily one of the $19$ items in our classification. For the quivers of\ntype $\\hat A \\otimes A$ we express the coefficients of the recurrences in terms\nof the partition functions for domino tilings of a cylinder, called\n\\emph{Goncharov-Kenyon Hamiltonians}. We also consider tropical $T$-systems of\ntype $\\hat A \\otimes A$ and explain how affine slices exhibit solitonic\nbehavior, i.e. soliton resolution and speed conservation. Throughout, we\nconjecture how the results in the paper are expected to generalize from $\\hat A\n\\otimes A$ to all other quivers in our classification.\n", "  Van Dam and Hayden introduced a concept commonly referred to as embezzlement,\nwhere, for any entangled quantum state $\\phi$, there is an entangled catalyst\nstate $\\psi$, from which a high fidelity approximation of $\\phi \\otimes \\psi$\ncan be produced using only local operations. We investigate a version of this\nwhere the embezzlement is perfect (i.e., the fidelity is 1). We prove that\nperfect embezzlement is impossible in a tensor product framework, even with\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and infinite entanglement entropy. Then we\nprove that perfect embezzlement is possible in a commuting operator framework.\nWe prove this using the theory of C*-algebras and we also provide an explicit\nconstruction. Next, we apply our results to analyze perfect versions of a\nnonlocal game introduced by Regev and Vidick. Finally, we analyze the structure\nof perfect embezzlement protocols in the commuting operator model, showing that\nthey require infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.\n", "  We consider stability of periodic travelling waves in the generalized reduced\nOstrovsky equation with respect to co-periodic perturbations. Compared to the\nrecent literature, we give a simple argument that proves spectral stability of\nall smooth periodic travelling waves independently on the nonlinearity power.\nThe argument is based on the energy convexity and does not use coordinate\ntransformations of the reduced Ostrovsky equations to the semi-linear equations\nof the Klein--Gordon type.\n", "  Recently, the iridate double perovskite Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$ has attracted\nconsiderable attention due to the report of unexpected magnetism in this\nIr$^{5+}$ (5d$^4$) material, in which according to the J$_{eff}$ model, a\nnon-magnetic ground state is expected. However, in recent works on\npolycrystalline samples of the series Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$YIrO$_6$ no indication of\nmagnetic transitions have been found. We present a structural, magnetic and\nthermodynamic characterization of Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$ single crystals, with emphasis\non the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the specific heat. Here, we\ndemonstrate the clue role of single crystal X-ray diffraction on the structural\ncharacterization of the Sr$_2$YIrO$_6$ double perovskite crystals by reporting\nthe detection of a $\\sqrt{2}a \\times \\sqrt{2}a \\times 1c$ supercell, where $a$,\n$b$ and $c$ are the unit cell dimensions of the reported monoclinic subcell. In\nagreement with the expected non-magnetic ground state of Ir$^{5+}$ (5d$^4$) in\nSr$_2$YIrO$_6$, no magnetic transition is observed down to 430~mK. Moreover,\nour results suggest that the low temperature anomaly observed in the specific\nheat is not related to the onset of long-range magnetic order. Instead, it is\nidentified as a Schottky anomaly caused by paramagnetic impurities present in\nthe sample, of the order of $n \\sim 0.5(2)$ \\%. These impurities lead to\nnon-negligible spin correlations, which nonetheless, are not associated with\nlong-range magnetic ordering.\n", "  In this paper, we consider classification problem of asymmetric gapped\nHamiltonians, which are given as the non-degenerate part of the Hamiltonians\nintroduced in [O1]. We consider the $C^1$-classification, which takes into\naccount the effect of boundaries. We show that the left and right degeneracies\nof edge ground states are the complete invariant. As a corollary, we consider\nthe bulk-classification problem. We study Hamiltonians that1.are given by\ntranslation invariant finite range interactions, 2.are gapped in the bulk,\n3.are frustration-free, 4.have uniformly bounded ground state degeneracy on\nfinite intervals, and 5.have a unique bulk ground state. We show that for the\nbulk-classification, any such Hamiltonians are equivalent.\n", "  We propose a new approach to the geometry of the four-qubit entanglement\nclasses depending on parameters. More precisely, we use invariant theory and\nalgebraic geometry to describe various stratifications of the Hilbert space by\nSLOCC invariant algebraic varieties. The normal forms of the four-qubit\nclassification of Verstraete {\\em et al.} are interpreted as dense subsets of\ncomponents of the dual variety of the set of separable states and an algorithm\nbased on the invariants/covariants of the four-qubit quantum states is proposed\nto identify a state with a SLOCC equivalent normal form (up to qubits\npermutation).\n", "  For entropy driven balanced processes we obtain final states with Poisson,\nBernoulli, negative binomial and P\\'olya distributions. We apply this both for\ncomplex networks and particle production. For random networks we follow the\nevolution of the degree distribution, $P_n$, in a system where a node can\nactivate $k$ fixed connections from $K$ possible partnerships among all nodes.\nThe total number of connections, $N$, is also fixed. For particle physics\nproblems $P_n$ is the probability of having $n$ particles (or other quanta)\ndistributed among $k$ states (phase space cells) while altogether a fixed\nnumber of $N$ particles reside on $K$ states.\n", "  Correctly formulated continuum models for lipid-bilayer membranes present a\nsignificant challenge to computational mechanics. In particular, the\nmid-surface behavior is that of a 2-dimensional fluid, while the membrane\nresists bending much like an elastic shell. Here we consider a well-known\nHelfrich-Cahn-Hilliard model for two-phase lipid-bilayer vesicles,\nincorporating mid-surface fluidity, curvature elasticity and a phase field. We\npresent a systematic approach to the direct computation of vesical\nconfigurations possessing icosahedral symmetry, which have been observed in\nexperiment and whose mathematical existence has recently been established. We\nfirst introduce a radial-graph formulation to overcome the difficulties\nassociated with fluidity within a conventional Lagrangian description. We use\nthe so-called subdivision surface finite element method combined with an\nicosahedral-symmetric mesh. The resulting discrete equations are\nwell-conditioned and inherit equivariance properties under a representation of\nthe icosahedral group. We use group-theoretic methods to obtain a reduced\nproblem that captures all icosahedral-symmetric solutions of the full problem.\nFinally we explore the behavior of our reduced model, varying numerous physical\nparameters present in the mathematical model.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) semiconductor materials of transition-metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) manifest many peculiar physical phenomena in the\nlight-matter interaction. Due to their ultrathin property, strong interaction\nwith light and the robust excitons at room temperature, they provide a perfect\nplatform for studying the physics of strong coupling in low dimension and at\nroom temperature. Here we report the strong coupling between 2D semiconductor\nexcitons and Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs). We observe a Rabi splitting of\nabout 54 meV at room temperature by measuring the angle resolved differential\nreflectivity spectra and simulate the theoretical results by using the transfer\nmatrix method. Our results will promote the realization of the TPP based\nultrathin polariton devices at room temperature.\n", "  An analysis of the physics-rich endgame of reionization at $z=5.7$ is\nperformed, utilizing jointly the observations of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest, the\nmean free path of ionizing photons, the luminosity function of galaxies and new\nphysical insight. We find that an upper limit on ${\\rm \\tau_e}$ provides a\nconstraint on the minimum mean free path (of ionizing photons) that is\nprimarily due to dwarf galaxies, which in turn yields a new and yet the\nstrongest constraint on the matter power spectrum on $10^6-10^9M_\\odot$ scales.\nWith the latest Planck measurements of ${\\rm \\tau_e = 0.055 \\pm 0.009}$, we can\nplace an upper limit of $(8.9\\times 10^6, 3.8\\times 10^7, 4.2\\times\n10^8)M_\\odot$ on the lower cutoff mass of the halo mass function, or equivalent\na lower limit on warm dark matter particle mass ${\\rm m_x \\ge (15.1, 9.8,\n4.6)keV}$ or on sterile neutrino mass ${\\rm m_s \\ge (161, 90, 33)keV}$, at $(1,\n1.4, 2.2)\\sigma$ confidence level, respectively.\n", "  We present predictions for single-diffractive low-mass Drell-Yan pair\nproduction in $pp$ collisions at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Predictions are\nobtained adopting a factorised form for the relevant cross sections and are\nbased on a new set of diffractive parton distributions resulting from the QCD\nanalysis of combined HERA leading proton data. We discuss a number of\nobservables useful to characterise the expected factorisation breaking effects.\n", "  We discuss the single diffractive production of $c \\bar c$ pairs and charmed\nmesons at the LHC. For a first time we propose a $k_t$-factorization approach\nto the diffractive processes. The transverse momentum dependent diffractive\nparton distributions are obtained from standard (collinear) diffractive parton\ndistributions used in the literature. In this calculation the transverse\nmomentum of the pomeron is neglected with respect to transverse momentum of\npartons entering the hard process. We also perform the first evaluation of the\ncross sections at the LHC using the diffractive transverse momentum dependent\nparton distributions. The results of the new approach are compared with those\nof the standard collinear one. Significantly larger cross sections are obtained\nin the $k_t$-factorization approach where some part of higher-order effects is\neffectively included. The differences between corresponding differential\ndistributions are discussed. Finally, we present a feasibility study of the\nprocess at the LHC using proton tagging technique. The analysis suggests that\nthe measurement of single diffractive charm production is possible using ATLAS\nand CMS/TOTEM detectors.\n", "  Optomechanics, nano-electromechanics, and integrated photonics have brought\nabout a renaissance in phononic device physics and technology. Central to this\nadvance are devices and materials that support ultra long-lived photonic and\nphononic excitations, providing access to novel regimes of classical and\nquantum dynamics based on tailorable photon-phonon coupling. Silica-based\ndevices have been at the forefront of such innovations for their ability to\nsupport optical excitations persisting for nearly 1 billion cycles, and for\ntheir low optical nonlinearity. Remarkably, acoustic phonon modes can persist\nfor a comparable number of cycles in crystalline solids at cryogenic\ntemperatures, permitting radical enhancement of photon-phonon coupling.\nHowever, it has not been possible to achieve similar phononic coherence times\nin silica, as silica becomes acoustically opaque at low temperatures. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that intrinsic forms of phonon dissipation are greatly\nreduced (by > 90%) using nonlinear saturation with continuous driving fields of\ndisparate frequencies. We demonstrate steady-state phononic spectral hole\nburning for the first time, and show that this technique for controlling\ndissipation in glass produces a wide-band transparency window. These studies\nwere carried out in a micro-scale fiber waveguide where the acoustic\nintensities necessary to manipulate phonon dissipation can be achieved with\noptically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple\nmodel that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by\nphononic saturation. In showing how the dissipative and dispersive properties\nof glasses can be manipulated using external fields, we open the door to\ndynamical phononic switching and the use of glasses as low loss phononic media\nwhich may enable new forms of controllable laser dynamics, information\nprocessing, and precision metrology.\n", "  The fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures, artificial materials\nassembled by individually stacking atomically thin (2D) materials, is one of\nthe most promising directions in 2D materials research. Until now, the most\nwidespread approach to stack 2D layers relies on deterministic placement\nmethods which are cumbersome when fabricating multilayered stacks. Moreover,\nthey tend to suffer from poor control over the lattice orientations and the\npresence of unwanted adsorbates between the stacked layers. Here, we present a\ndifferent approach to fabricate ultrathin heterostructures by exfoliation of\nbulk franckeite which is a naturally occurring and air stable van der Waals\nheterostructure (composed of alternating SnS2-like and PbS-like layers stacked\non top of each other). Presenting both an attractive narrow bandgap (<0.7 eV)\nand p-type doping, we find that the material can be exfoliated both\nmechanically and chemically down to few-layer thicknesses. We present extensive\ntheoretical and experimental characterizations of the material's electronic\nproperties and crystal structure, and explore applications for near-infrared\nphotodetectors (exploiting its narrow bandgap) and for p-n junctions based on\nthe stacking of MoS2 (n-doped) and franckeite (p-doped)\n", "  We introduce a mathematical model on the dynamics of demand and supply\nincorporating collectability and saturation factors. Our analysis shows that\nwhen the fluctuation of the determinants of demand and supply is strong enough,\nthere is chaos in the demand-supply dynamics. Our numerical simulation shows\nthat such a chaos is not an attractor (i.e. dynamics is not approaching the\nchaos), instead a periodic attractor (of period 3 under the Poincar\\'e period\nmap) exists near the chaos, and co-exists with another periodic attractor (of\nperiod 1 under the Poincar\\'e period map) near the market equilibrium. Outside\nthe basins of attraction of the two periodic attractors, the dynamics\napproaches infinity indicating market irrational exuberance or flash crash. The\nperiod 3 attractor represents the product's market cycle of growth and\nrecession, while period 1 attractor near the market equilibrium represents the\nregular fluctuation of the product's market. Thus our model captures more\nmarket phenomena besides Marshall's market equilibrium. When the fluctuation of\nthe determinants of demand and supply is strong enough, a three leaf danger\nzone exists where the basins of attraction of all attractors intertwine and\nfractal basin boundaries are formed. Small perturbations in the danger zone can\nlead to very different attractors. That is, small perturbations in the danger\nzone can cause the market to experience oscillation near market equilibrium,\nlarge growth and recession cycle, and irrational exuberance or flash crash.\n", "  The experimental realization of quantum-degenerate Bose gases made of atoms\nwith sizeable magnetic dipole moments has created a new type of fluid, known as\na quantum ferrofluid, which combines the extraordinary properties of\nsuperfluidity and ferrofluidity. A hallmark of superfluids is that they are\nconstrained to rotate through vortices with quantized circulation. In quantum\nferrofluids the long-range dipolar interactions add new ingredients by inducing\nmagnetostriction and instabilities, and also affect the structural properties\nof vortices and vortex lattices. Here we give a review of the theory of\nvortices in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, exploring the interplay of\nmagnetism with vorticity and contrasting this with the established behaviour in\nnon-dipolar condensates. We cover single vortex solutions, including structure,\nenergy and stability, vortex pairs, including interactions and dynamics, and\nalso vortex lattices. Our discussion is founded on the mean-field theory\nprovided by the dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii equation, ranging from analytic\ntreatments based on the Thomas-Fermi (hydrodynamic) and variational approaches\nto full numerical simulations. Routes for generating vortices in dipolar\ncondensates are discussed, with particular attention paid to rotating\ncondensates, where surface instabilities drive the nucleation of vortices, and\nlead to the emergence of rich and varied vortex lattice structures. We also\npresent an outlook, including potential extensions to degenerate Fermi gases,\nquantum Hall physics, toroidal systems and the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition.\n", "  The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a staged experiment to\nmeasure 21 cm emission from the primordial intergalactic medium (IGM)\nthroughout cosmic reionization ($z=6-12$), and to explore earlier epochs of our\nCosmic Dawn ($z\\sim30$). During these epochs, early stars and black holes\nheated and ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission. HERA is\ndesigned to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm power spectrum to constrain\nthe timing and morphology of reionization, the properties of the first\ngalaxies, the evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of\nheating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element interferometer in South\nAfrica consisting of 14-m parabolic dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz.\nCurrently, 19 dishes have been deployed on site and the next 18 are under\nconstruction. HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument.\n  In this paper, we summarize HERA's scientific context and provide forecasts\nfor its key science results. After reviewing the current state of the art in\nforeground mitigation, we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate\nhigh-level performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we present\nthe HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem specifications that ensure\nthat HERA meets its performance requirements. Finally, we summarize the\nschedule and status of the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the\nrealities of foreground contamination, current-generation 21 cm instruments are\napproaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is designed to bring both the\nsensitivity and the precision to deliver its primary science on the basis of\nproven foreground filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction\ntechniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a major step toward\nrealizing the widely recognized scientific potential of 21 cm cosmology.\n", "  We show that the predictivity of general gauge mediation (GGM) with TeV-scale\nstops is greatly increased once the Higgs mass constraint is imposed. The most\nnotable results are a strong lower bound on the mass of the gluino and\nright-handed squarks, and an upper bound on the Higgsino mass. If the\nmu-parameter is positive, the wino mass is also bounded from above. These\nconstraints relax significantly for high messenger scales and as such\nlong-lived NLSPs are favored in GGM. We identify a small set of most promising\ntopologies for the neutralino/sneutrino NLSP scenarios and estimate the impact\nof the current bounds and the sensitivity of the high luminosity LHC. The stau,\nstop and sbottom NLSP scenarios can be robustly excluded at the high luminosity\nLHC.\n", "  We introduce the phenomenology of elliptic flow in nuclear collisions, and\nargue that its scaling across energies, rapidities and system sizes could be\nsuggestive of a QCD-based rather than a hydrodynamical explanation. As a\nhypothesis for such an explanation, we show that the GLR equation develops\nunstable modes when the parton distribution function is generalized to depend\non azimuthal angle. This generally means the structure function aquires an\nazimuthal dependence. We argue that this process is a plausible alternative\nexplanation for the origin of elliptic flow, one that naturally respects the\nscaling experimentally observed.\n", "  It is known that measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution\n(MDI-QKD) provides ultimate security from all types of side-channel attack\nagainst detectors at the expense of low key generation rate. Here, we propose\nMDI-QKD using 3-dimensional quantum states and show that the protocol improves\nthe secret key rate under the analysis of mismatched-basis statistics.\nSpecifically, we analyze security of the 3d-MDI-QKD protocol with\nuncharacterized sources, meaning that the original sources contain unwanted\nstates instead of expected one. We simulate secret key rate of the protocol and\nidentify the regime where the key rate is higher than the protocol with the\nqubit MDI-QKD.\n", "  Rigidities of even-even nuclei were estimated and compared with nuclear\ncharge radii. Correlation of maximal nuclear rigidities with minimal values of\nr0 parameters was revealed. Influence of effective surface tension on nuclear\nproperties was discussed.\n", "  We investigate quantum synchronization phenomenon within the complex network\nconstituted by coupled optomechanical systems and prove the unknown identical\nquantum states can be shared or distributed in the quantum network even though\nthe topology is varying. Considering a channel constructed by quantum\ncorrelation, we show that quantum synchronization can sustain and maintain high\nlevels in Markovian dissipation for a long time. We analyze state sharing\nprocess between two typical complex networks, that is, a small-world network\ncorresponding to linear motif state sharing and a scale-free network\ncorresponding to whole network sharing, respectively. Our results predict that\nlinked nodes can be directly synchronized in small-world network, but the whole\nnetwork will be synchronized only if some specific synchronization conditions\nare satisfied. Furthermore, we give the synchronization conditions analytically\nthrough analyzing network dynamics. This proposal paves the way for studying\nmulti-interaction synchronization and achieving an effective quantum\ninformation processing in complex network.\n", "  Transitions of charged leptons from one generation to another are basically\nprohibited in the Standard Model because of the mysteriously tiny neutrino\nmasses, although such flavor-violating transitions have been long observed for\nquarks and neutrinos. Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories (SUSY GUT), which\nunify quarks and leptons as well as their forces, predict that charged leptons\nshould also make such transitions at small but experimentally observable rates.\nThe MEG experiment was the first to have explored one of such transitions, mu+\n-> e+ gamma decays, down to the branching ratios predicted by SUSY GUT. Here we\nreport the final results of the MEG experiment based on the full dataset\ncollected from 2009 to 2013 at the Paul Scherrer Institut, corresponding to a\ntotal of 7.5 x 10^14 stopped muons on target. No excess for mu+ -> e+ gamma\ndecays was found. Thus the most stringent upper bound was placed on the\nbranching ratio, B(mu+ -> e+ gamma) < 4.2 x 10^-13 at 90% C.L., about 30 times\ntighter than previous experiments, and severely constrains SUSY GUT and other\nwell-motivated theories. We are now preparing the upgraded experiment MEG II\nwith an aim to achieve a sensitivity of 4 x 10^-14 after three years of data\ntaking. It is expected to start late in 2017.\n", "  Different types of Lifshitz transitions are governed by topology in momentum\nspace. They involve the topological transitions with the change of topology of\nFermi surfaces, Weyl and Dirac points, nodal ines, and also the transitions\nbetween the fully gapped states.\n", "  In this paper, we derive new continuous time limits of the Utterance\nSelection Model (USM) for language change (Baxter et al., Phys. Rev. E {\\bf\n73}, 046118, 2006). This is motivated by the fact that the Fokker-Planck\ncontinuous time limit derived in the original version of the USM is only valid\nfor a small range of parameters. We investigate the consequences of relaxing\nthese constraints on parameters. Using the normal approximation of the\nmultinomial approximation, we derive a new continuous time limit of the USM in\nthe form of a weak-noise stochastic differential equation. We argue that this\nweak noise, not captured by the Kramers-Moyal expansion, can not be neglected.\nWe then propose a coarse-graining procedure, which takes the form of a\nstochastic version of the \\emph{heterogeneous mean field} approximation. This\napproximation groups the behaviour of nodes of same degree, reducing the\ncomplexity of the problem. With the help of this approximation, we study in\ndetail two simple families of networks: the regular networks and the\nstar-shaped networks. The analysis reveals and quantifies a finite size effect\nof the dynamics. If we increase the size of the network by keeping all the\nother parameters constant, we transition from a state where conventions emerge\nto a state when no convention emerges. Furthermore, we show that the degree of\na node acts as a time scale. For heterogeneous networks such as star-shaped\nnetworks, the time scale difference can become very large leading to a noisier\nbehaviour of highly connected nodes.\n", "  The LHC is expected to reach luminosities up to 3000fb-1 and the innermost\nlayer of the ATLAS upgrade plans to cope with higher occupancy and to decrease\nthe pixel size. 3D-Si sensors are a good candidate for the innermost layer of\nthe ATLAS pixel upgrade since they exhibit good performance under high fluences\nand the new designs will have smaller pixel size to fulfill the electronics\nexpectations. This paper reports TCAD simulations of the 3D-Si sensors designed\nat IMB-CNM with non passing-through columns that are being fabricated for the\nnext innermost layer of the ATLAS pixel upgrade, shows the charge collection\nresponse before and after irradiation, and the response of 3D-Si sensors\nlocated at large $\\eta$ angles.\n", "  A review of recent developments of the dispersive optical model (DOM) is\npresented. Starting from the original work of Mahaux and Sartor, several\nnecessary steps are developed and illustrated which increase the scope of the\nDOM allowing its interpretation as generating an experimentally constrained\nfunctional form of the nucleon self-energy. The method could therefore be\nrenamed as the dispersive self-energy method.\n  The aforementioned steps include the introduction of simultaneous fits of\ndata for chains of isotopes or isotones allowing a data-driven extrapolation\nfor the prediction of scattering cross sections and level properties in the\ndirection of the respective drip lines. In addition, the energy domain for data\nwas enlarged to include results up to 200 MeV where available. An important\napplication of this work was implemented by employing these DOM potentials to\nthe analysis of the (\\textit{d,p}) transfer reaction using the adiabatic\ndistorted wave approximation (ADWA).\n  We review the fully non-local DOM potential fitted to ${}^{40}$Ca where\nelastic-scattering data, level information, particle number, charge density and\nhigh-momentum-removal $(e,e'p)$ cross sections obtained at Jefferson Lab were\nincluded in the analysis. An important consequence of this new analysis is the\nfinding that the spectroscopic factor for the removal of valence protons in\nthis nucleus comes out larger by about 0.15 than the results obtained from the\nNIKHEF analysis of their $(e,e'p)$ data. Another important consequence of this\nanalysis is that it can shed light on the relative importance of two-body and\nthree-body interactions as far as their contribution to the energy of the\nground state is concerned through application of the energy sum rule.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the stability of a two cascaded cavity\noptomechanical system with optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) inside the two\ncoupled cavities, and study the steady-state entanglement between two distant\nmechanical resonators. We show that the parameter regime where the system is\nunstable without OPAs, such as relatively high laser intensity and blue\ndetuning, can be exploited to build the steady-state mechanical entanglement by\nmodulating the parametric gain. The application of OPAs is helpful to preserve\nthe mechanical entanglement suffered from the dissipation at some finite\ntemperature. The scheme provides an alternative way for improving and\nengineering the quantum entanglement of two distant mechanical oscillators.\n", "  We perform theoretical investigation of the localized state dynamics in the\npresence of interaction with the reservoir and Coulomb correlations. We analyze\nkinetic equations for electron occupation numbers with different spins taking\ninto account high order correlation functions for the localized electrons. We\nreveal that in the stationary state electron occupation numbers with the\nopposite spins always have the same value - the stationary state is a\n$\"$paramagnetic$\"$ one. $\"$Magnetic$\"$ properties can appear only in the\nnon-stationary characteristics of the single-impurity Anderson model and in the\ndynamics of the localized electrons second order correlation functions. We\nfound, that for deep energy levels and strong Coulomb correlations, relaxation\ntime for initial $\"$magnetic$\"$ state can be several orders larger than for\n$\"$paramagnetic$\"$ one. So, long-living $\"$magnetic$\"$ moment can exist in the\nsystem. We also found non-stationary spin polarized currents flowing in\nopposite directions for the different spins in the particular time interval.\n", "  We study the right-handed neutrino (RHN) dark matter candidate in the minimal\nU(1)_{B-L} gauge extension of the standard model. The U(1)_{B-L} gauge symmetry\noffers three RHNs which can address the origin of the neutrino mass, the relic\ndark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The lightest\namong the three is taken as the dark matter candidate, which is under the B-L\ngauge interaction. We investigate various scenarios for this dark matter\ncandidate with the correct relic density by means of the freeze-out or\nfreeze-in mechanism. A viable RHN dark matter mass lies in a wide range\nincluding keV to TeV scale. We emphasize the sub-electroweak scale light B-L\ngauge boson case, and identify the parameter region motivated from the dark\nmatter physics, which can be tested with the planned experiments including the\nCERN SHiP experiment.\n", "  Quantum networking links quantum processors through remote entanglement for\ndistributed quantum information processing (QIP) and secure long-range\ncommunication. Trapped ions are a leading QIP platform, having demonstrated\nuniversal small-scale processors and roadmaps for large-scale implementation.\nOverall rates of ion-photon entanglement generation, essential for remote\ntrapped ion entanglement, are limited by coupling efficiency into single mode\nfibres5 and scaling to many ions. Here we show a microfabricated trap with\nintegrated diffractive mirrors that couples 4.1(6)% of the fluorescence from a\n$^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion into a single mode fibre, nearly triple the demonstrated\nbulk optics efficiency. The integrated optic collects 5.8(8)% of the {\\pi}\ntransition fluorescence, images the ion with sub-wavelength resolution, and\ncouples 71(5)% of the collected light into the fibre. Our technology is\nsuitable for entangling multiple ions in parallel and overcomes mode quality\nlimitations of existing integrated optical interconnects. In addition, the\nefficiencies are sufficient for fault tolerant QIP.\n", "  We consider a family of quantum Hamiltonians $H_\\hbar=-\\hbar^2\\,(d^2\\!/dx^2)\n+V(x)$, $x\\in\\mathbb{R},$ $\\hbar>0,$ where $V(x)=i(x^3-x)$ is an imaginary\ndouble well potential. We prove the existence of infinite eigenvalue crossings\nwith the selection rules of the eigenvalue pairs taking part in a crossing.\nThis is a semiclassical localization effect. The eigenvalues at the crossings\naccumulate at a critical energy for some of the Stokes lines.\n", "  A spiral fiber tracker (SFT) has been designed and produced for the J-PARC\nE36 experiment as an element of the tracking system for conducting a\nhigh-resolution momentum measurement of charge particles from kaon decays. A\nnovel technique to wind the pre-made fiber ribbons spirally was employed for\nthe configuration with four detector layers made of 1 mm diameter plastic\nscintillating fibers. Good position alignment and sufficiently high detection\nefficiency for charged particles with minimum ionizing energy were confirmed in\ncosmic ray test. The tracker was successfully used in the E36 experiment.\n", "  In order to address the observation of the neutrino oscillations and the\nmetastability of the Standard Model, we extend the fermion sector with two\nright-handed (i.e. sterile) neutrinos, and the scalar sector of the SM with a\nreal scalar, the Hill field. The latter takes the role of a Majoron and\ngenerates the Majorana masses for the neutrino sector, such that the particle\nspectrum features two CP-even scalars $h_1$ and $h_2$, and also two heavy, mass\ndegenerate neutrinos. When the $h_1$ is identified with the scalar resonance at\n~125 GeV and the condition is imposed that the $h_1$ self coupling and its\nrunning vanish at the Planck scale, the scalar mixing and the vacuum\nexpectation value of the Hill field are fixed by the $h_2$ mass. The $h_2$ can\nbe searched for at the LHC, and it has prospects of being discovered for the\ntarget integrated luminosities of the HL-LHC and the Future Circular hadron\nCollider (FCC-hh) when its mass is on the weak scale. The knowledge of the\n$h_2$ mass and its decay properties can yield an insight into its coupling to\nthe heavy neutrinos, and thus also on the heavy neutrino mass scale. This\nyields an interesting connection between potentially detectable heavy scalars\nin high-energy proton collisions and the mass scale of the heavy neutrinos that\nis testable at the LHC and at future colliders.\n", "  The behaviour of a massive, non-interacting and non-minimally coupled\nquantised scalar field in an expanding de Sitter background is investigated by\nsolving the field evolution for an arbitrary initial state. In this approach\nthere is no need to choose a vacuum in order to provide a definition for\nparticle states. We conclude that the expanding de Sitter space is a stable\nequilibrium configuration under small perturbations of the initial conditions.\nDepending on the initial state, the energy density can approach its asymptotic\nvalue from above or below, the latter of which implies a violation of the weak\nenergy condition. The backreaction of the quantum corrections can therefore\nlead to a phase of super-acceleration also in the non-interacting massive case.\n", "  Theoretical efforts to describe and explain the $\\eta\\to 3\\pi$ decays reach\nfar back in time. Even today, the convergence of the decay widths and some of\nthe Dalitz plot parameters seems problematic in low energy QCD. In the\nframework of resummed CHPT, we explore the question of compatibility of\nexperimental data with a reasonable convergence of a carefully defined chiral\nseries, where NNLO remainders are assumed to be small. By treating the\nuncertainties in the higher orders statistically, we numerically generate a\nlarge set of theoretical predictions, which are then confronted with\nexperimental information. In the case of the decay widths, the experimental\nvalues can be reconstructed for a reasonable range of the free parameters and\nthus no tension is observed, in spite of what some of the traditional\ncalculations suggest. The Dalitz plot parameters $a$ and $d$ can be described\nvery well too. When the parameters $b$ and $\\alpha$ are concerned, we find a\nmild tension for the whole range of the free parameters, at less than 2$\\sigma$\nC.L. This can be interpreted in two ways - either some of the higher order\ncorrections are indeed unexpectedly large or there is a specific configuration\nof the remainders, which is, however, not completely improbable. Also, the\ndistribution of the theoretical uncertainties is found to be significantly\nnon-gaussian, so the consistency cannot be simply judged by the 1$\\sigma$ error\nbars.\n", "  Fast and controllable cooling at nanoscales requires a combination of highly\nefficient passive cooling and active cooling. While passive cooling in\ngraphene-based devices is quite effective due to graphene's extraordinary\nheat-conduction, active cooling has not been considered feasible due to\ngraphene's low thermoelectric power factor. Here we show that the\nthermoelectric performance of graphene can be significantly improved by using\nhBN substrates instead of SiO2. We find the room temperature efficiency of\nactive cooling, as gauged by the power factor times temperature, reaches values\nas high as 10.35 W/mK, corresponding to more than doubling the highest reported\nroom temperature bulk power factors, 5 W/mK in YbAl3, and quadrupling the best\n2D power factor, 2.5 W/mK, in MoS2. We further show that in these devices the\nelectron-hole puddles region is significantly reduced. This enables fast\ngate-controlled switching of the Seebeck coefficient polarity for application\nin n- and p-type integrated active cooling devices.\n", "  In this paper, we study the significance of the U$_\\textrm{Y}$(1)\nChern-Simons term in general, and its baryonic contribution in particular, for\nthe evolution of the matter asymmetries and the hypermagnetic field in the\ntemperature range $100$GeV$\\leq T \\leq 10$TeV. We show that an initial helical\nhypermagnetic field, denoted by $B_Y^{(0)}$, can grow matter asymmetries from\nzero initial value. However, the growth which is initially quadratic with\nrespect to $B_Y^{(0)}$, saturates for values larger than a critical value. The\ninclusion of the baryonic contribution reduces this critical value, leading to\nsmaller final matter asymmetries. Meanwhile, $B_Y(T_{EW})$ becomes slightly\nlarger than $B_Y^{(0)}$. In the absence of the U$_\\textrm{Y}$(1) Chern-Simons\nterm, the final values of matter asymmetries grow without saturation.\nConversely, we show that an initial matter asymmetry can grow an initial seed\nof hypermagnetic field, provided the Chern-Simons term is taken into account.\nThe growth process saturates when the matter asymmetry drops abruptly. When the\nbaryonic contribution is included, the saturation occurs at an earlier time,\nand $B_Y (T_{EW})$ becomes larger. We also show the results can be within the\nacceptable range of present day data, provided the inverse cascade process is\nalso taken into account.\n", "  We use the Bose-Hubbard model with an effective infinite-range interaction to\ndescribe the correlated lattice bosons in an optical cavity. We study both\nstatic and spectral properties of such system within the bosonic dynamical\nmean-field theory (B-DMFT), which is the state of the art method for strongly\ncorrelated bosonic systems. Both similarities and differences are found and\ndiscussed between our results and these obtained within different theoretical\nmethods and experiment.\n", "  The Voronoi diagrams are an important tool having theoretical and practical\napplications in a large number of fields. We present a new procedure,\nimplemented as a set of CUDA kernels, which detects, in a general and efficient\nway, topological changes in case of dynamic Voronoi diagrams whose generating\npoints move in time. The solution that we provide has been originally developed\nto identify plastic events during simulations of soft-glassy materials based on\na Lattice Boltzmann model with frustrated-short range attractive and\nmid/long-range repulsive-interactions. Along with the description of our\napproach, we present also some preliminary physics results.\n", "  The information loss paradox is often presented as an unavoidable consequence\nof well-established physics. However, in order for a genuine paradox to ensue,\nnot-trivial assumptions about, e.g., quantum effects on spacetime, are\nnecessary. In this work we will be explicit about these additional, speculative\nassumptions required. We will also sketch a map of the available routes to\ntackle the issue, highlighting the, often overlooked, commitments demanded of\neach alternative. In particular, we will display the strong link between black\nholes, the issue of information loss and the measurement problem.\n", "  We observed strongly size-dependent viscoelasticity in amorphous SiO2 and Si\nnanotubes with shell thickness down to ~8 nm. A core-shell model shows that a\n~1 nm thick fluid-like surface layer has a significant effect on the mechanical\nbehavior of nanotubes and matches well with our experimental results.\nSurprising, the surface layer exhibits a room temperature viscosity equivalent\nto that of bulk glass above 1000 C. Additionally, a low activation energy\nextracted from temperature dependent creep tests indicates that the viscous\nflow in the surface layer is due to bond motion/switching, instead of bond\nbreaking. These findings unambiguously show the presence of a fluid-like\nsurface layer and elucidate its role on dynamic mechanical behavior in\nnanoscale inorganic glass.\n", "  Identification and quantification of possible drivers of recent climate\nvariability remain a challenging task. This important issue is addressed\nadopting a non-parametric information theory technique, the Transfer Entropy\nand its normalized variant. It distinctly quantifies actual information\nexchanged along with the directional flow of information between any two\nvariables with no bearing on their common history or inputs, unlike\ncorrelation, mutual information etc. Measurements of greenhouse gases, CO2,\nCH4, and N2O; volcanic aerosols; solar activity: UV radiation, total solar\nirradiance (TSI ) and cosmic ray flux (CR); El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nand Global Mean Temperature Anomaly (GMTA) made during 1984-2005 are utilized\nto distinguish driving and responding climate signals. Estimates of their\nrelative contributions reveal that CO 2 (~24%), CH 4 (~19%) and volcanic\naerosols (~23%) are the primary contributors to the observed variations in\nGMTA. While, UV (~9%) and ENSO (~12%) act as secondary drivers of variations in\nthe GMTA, the remaining play a marginal role in the observed recent climate\nvariability. Interestingly, ENSO and GMTA mutually drive each other at varied\ntime lags. This study assists future modelling efforts in climate science.\n", "  WavePacket is an open-source program package for the numerical simulation of\nquantum-mechanical dynamics. It can be used to solve time-independent or\ntime-dependent linear Schr\\\"odinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations in one\nor more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows to\nsimulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\nOptionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within\nthe semiclassical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate\nexperiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or\nchemistry.The graphical capabilities allow visualization of quantum dynamics\n'on the fly', including Wigner phase space representations. Being easy to use\nand highly versatile, WavePacket is well suited for the teaching of quantum\nmechanics as well as for research projects in atomic, molecular and optical\nphysics or in physical or theoretical chemistry.The present Part I deals with\nthe description of closed quantum systems in terms of Schr\\\"odinger equations.\nThe emphasis is on discrete variable representations for spatial discretization\nas well as various techniques for temporal discretization.The upcoming Part II\nwill focus on open quantum systems and dimension reduction; it also describes\nthe codes for optimal control of quantum dynamics.The present work introduces\nthe MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.2.1 which is hosted at the Sourceforge\nplatform, where extensive Wiki-documentation as well as worked-out\ndemonstration examples can be found.\n", "  The radio nebula W50 harbours the relativistic binary system SS433, which is\na source of the powerful wind and jets. The origin of W50 is wrapped in the\ninterplay of the wind, supernova remnant and jets. The evolution of the jets on\nthe scales of the nebula is a Rosetta stone for its origin. To disentangle the\nroles of these components, we study physical conditions of the jets propagation\ninside W50, and determine deceleration of the jets. The morphology and\nparameters of the interior of W50 are analyzed using the available observations\nof the eastern X-ray lobe, which traces the jet. In order to estimate\ndeceleration of this jet, we devised a simplistic model of the viscous\ninteraction, via turbulence, of a jet with the ambient medium, which would fit\nmass entrainment from the ambient medium into the jets of the radio galaxy\n3C31, the well studied case of continuously decelerating jets. X-ray\nobservations suggest that the eastern jet persists through W50 as hollow one,\nand is recollimated to the opening $\\sim 30^\\circ$. From the thermal emission\nof the eastern X-ray lobe, we determine a pressure of $P \\sim 3\\cdot 10^{-11}$\nerg/cm$^3$ inside W50. In the frame of a theory of the dynamics of radiative\nsupernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles, this pressure in combination with\nother known parameters restricts W50's origin to a supernova happened $\\sim\n100\\,000$ yr ago. Also, this pressure in our entrainment model gives a\ndeceleration of the jet by $\\sim 60\\%$ in the bounds of W50's spherical\ncomponent, of radius $\\sim 40$ pc. In this case, the age of the jet should be\n$\\ll 27\\,000$ yr so as to satisfy the sphericity of W50. The entrainment model\ncomes to the viscous stress in a jet of a form $\\sigma = \\alpha P$, where the\nviscosity parameter $\\alpha$ is predefined by the model.\n", "  Current optical imaging surveys for cosmology are covering large areas of\nsky. To exploit the statistical power of these surveys for weak lensing\nmeasurements requires shape measurement methods with subpercent systematic\nerrors. We introduce a new weak lensing shear measurement algorithm, Shear\nNulling after PSF Gaussianisation (SNAPG), designed to avoid the noise biases\nthat affect most other methods. SNAPG operates on images that have been\nconvolved with a kernel that renders the Point Spread Function (PSF) a circular\nGaussian, and uses weighted second moments of the sources. The response of such\nsecond moments to a shear of the pre-seeing galaxy image can be predicted\nanalytically, allowing us to construct a shear nulling scheme that finds the\nshear parameters for which the observed galaxies are consistent with an\nunsheared, isotropically oriented population of sources. The inverse of this\nnulling shear is then an estimate of the gravitational lensing shear. We\nidentify the uncertainty of the estimated centre of each galaxy as the source\nof noise bias, and incorporate an approximate estimate of the centroid\ncovariance into the scheme. We test the method on extensive suites of simulated\ngalaxies of increasing complexity, and find that it is capable of shear\nmeasurements with multiplicative bias below 0.5 percent.\n", "  We report on resonance fluorescence from a single quantum dot emitting at\ntelecom wavelengths. We perform high-resolution spectroscopy and observe the\nMollow triplet in the Rabi regime--a hallmark of resonance fluorescence. The\nmeasured resonance-fluorescence spectra allow us to rule out pure dephasing as\na significant decoherence mechanism in these quantum dots. Combined with\nnumerical simulations, the experimental results provide robust characterisation\nof charge noise in the environment of the quantum dot. Resonant control of the\nquantum dot opens up new possibilities for on-demand generation of\nindistinguishable single photons at telecom wavelengths as well as quantum\noptics experiments and direct manipulation of solid-state qubits in\ntelecom-wavelength quantum dots.\n", "  The ambitious instrument suite for the future European Spallation Source\nwhose civil construction started recently in Lund, Sweden, demands a set of\ndiverse and challenging requirements for the neutron detectors. For instance,\nthe unprecedented high flux expected on the samples to be investigated in\nneutron diffraction or reflectometry experiments requires detectors that can\nhandle high counting rates, while the investigation of sub-millimeter protein\ncrystals will only be possible with large-area detectors that can achieve a\nposition resolution as low as 200 {\\mu}m. This has motivated an extensive\nresearch and development campaign to advance the state-of-the-art detector and\nto find new technologies that can reach maturity by the time the ESS will\noperate at full potential. This paper presents the key detector requirements\nfor three of the Time-of-Flight diffraction instrument concepts selected by the\nScientific Advisory Committee to advance into the phase of preliminary\nengineering design. We discuss the available detector technologies suitable for\nthis particular instrument class and their major challenges. The detector\ntechnologies selected by the instrument teams to collect the diffraction\npatterns are briefly discussed. Analytical calculations, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, and real experimental data are used to develop a generic method to\nesti- mate the event rate in the diffraction detectors. The proposed approach\nis based upon conservative assumptions that use information and input\nparameters that reflect our current level of knowledge and understanding of the\nESS project. We apply this method to make predictions for the future\ndiffraction instruments, and thus provide additional information that can help\nthe instrument teams with the optimisation of the detector designs.\n", "  Faceted shapes, such as polyhedra, are commonly found in systems of\nnanoscale, colloidal, and granular particles. Many interesting physical\nphenomena, like crystal nucleation and growth, vacancy motion, and glassy\ndynamics are challenging to model in these systems because they require\ndetailed dynamical information at the individual particle level. Within the\ngranular materials community the Discrete Element Method has been used\nextensively to model systems of anisotropic particles under gravity, with\nfriction. We provide an implementation of this method intended for simulation\nof hard, faceted nanoparticles, with a conservative Weeks-Chandler-Andersen\n(WCA) interparticle potential, coupled to a thermodynamic ensemble. This method\nis a natural extension of classical molecular dynamics and enables rigorous\nthermodynamic calculations for faceted particles.\n", "  The spontaneous pair production of charged scalars in a near extremal\nKerr-Newman (KN) black hole is analytically studied. It is shown that the\nexistence condition for the pair production is equivalent to the violation of\nthe Breitenlohner-Freedman bound in an AdS$_2$ space. The mean number of\nproduced pairs in the extremal black hole has a thermal interpretation, in\nwhich the effective temperature for the Schwinger effect in the AdS$_2$ space\npersistently holds, while the mean number in the near extremal black hole has\nan additional factor of the Schwinger effect in the Rindler space. In addition,\nthe holographic dual conformal field theory (CFT) descriptions of the charged\nscalar pair production are respectively realized both in the $J$ and $Q$\npictures in terms of the KN/CFTs correspondence.\n", "  A physical model based on a Monte-Carlo approach is proposed to calculate the\nionization dynam- ics of warm dense matters (WDM) within particle-in-cell\nsimulations, and where the impact (col- lision) ionization (CI), electron-ion\nrecombination (RE) and ionization potential depression (IPD) by surrounding\nplasmas are taken into consideration self-consistently. When compared with\nother models, which are applied in the literature for plasmas near thermal\nequilibrium, the temporal re- laxation of ionization dynamics can also be\nsimulated by the proposed model. Besides, this model is general and can be\napplied for both single elements and alloys with quite different composi-\ntions. The proposed model is implemented into a particle-in-cell (PIC) code,\nwith (final) ionization equilibriums sustained by competitions between CI and\nits inverse process (i.e., RE). Comparisons between the full model and model\nwithout IPD or RE are performed. Our results indicate that for bulk aluminium\nin the WDM regime, i) the averaged ionization degree increases by including\nIPD; while ii) the averaged ionization degree is significantly over estimated\nwhen the RE is neglected. A direct comparison from the PIC code is made with\nthe existing models for the dependence of averaged ionization degree on thermal\nequilibrium temperatures, and shows good agreements with that generated from\nSaha-Boltzmann model or/and FLYCHK code.\n", "  We study the long time dynamics in closed quantum systems periodically driven\nvia time dependent parameters with two frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2=r\n\\omega_1$. Tuning of the ratio $r$ there can unleash plenty of dynamical\nphenomena to occur. Our study includes integrable models like Ising and XY\nmodels in $d=1$ and Kitaev model in $d=1$ and $2$ and can also be extended to\nDirac fermions in graphene. We witness the wave-function overlap or dynamic\nfreezing to occur within some small/ intermediate frequency regimes in the\n$(\\omega_1 ,r)$ plane (with $r\\ne0$) when the ground state is evolved through\nsingle cycle of driving. However, evolved states soon become steady with long\ndriving and the freezing scenario gets rarer. We extend the formalism of\nadiabatic-impulse approximation for many cycle driving within our two-rate\nprotocol and show the near-exact comparisons at small frequencies. An extension\nof the rotating wave approximation is also developed to gather an analytical\nframework of the dynamics at high frequencies. Finally we compute the\nentanglement entropy in the stroboscopically evolved states within the gapped\nphases of the system and observe how it gets tuned with the ratio $r$ in our\nprotocol. The minimally entangled states are found to fall within the regime of\ndynamical freezing. In general, the results indicate that the entanglement\nentropy in our driven short-ranged integrable systems follow genuine non-area\nlaw of scaling and show a convergence (with a $r$ dependent pace) towards\nvolume scaling behavior as the driving is continued for long time.\n", "  We show that the Josephson plasma frequency for a condensate in a double-well\npotential, whose dynamics is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation,\ncan be obtained with great precision by means of the usual Bogoliubov approach,\nwhereas the two-mode model - commonly constructed by means of a linear\ncombinations of the low-lying states of the GP equation - generally provides\naccurate results only for weak interactions. A proper two-mode model in terms\nof the Bogoliubov functions is also discussed, revealing that in general a\ntwo-mode approach is formally justified only for not too large interactions,\neven in the limit of very small amplitude oscillations. Here we consider\nspecifically the case of a one-dimensional system, but the results are expected\nto be valid in arbitrary dimensions.\n", "  Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with adverse human health\neffects, and China is currently suffering from serious PM2.5 pollution. To\nobtain spatially continuous ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, several models\nestablished by point-surface fusion of ground station and satellite\nobservations have been developed. However, how well do these models perform at\nnational scale in China? Is there space to improve the estimation accuracy of\nPM2.5 concentration? The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly,\ntaking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we\ndevelop a national-scale generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model to\nestimate PM2.5 concentrations. Secondly, different assessment experiments are\nundertaken in time and space, to comprehensively evaluate and compare the\nperformance of the widely used models. Finally, to map the yearly and seasonal\nmean distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in China, a pixel-based merging\nstrategy is proposed. The results indicate that the conventional models (linear\nregression, multiple linear regression, and semi-empirical model) do not\nperform well at national scale, with cross-validation R values of 0.488~0.552\nand RMSEs of 30.80~31.51 {\\mu}g/m3, respectively. In contrast, the more\nadvanced models (geographically weighted regression, back-propagation neural\nnetwork, and GRNN) have great advantages in PM2.5 estimation, with R values\nranging from 0.610 to 0.816 and RMSEs from 20.93 to 28.68 {\\mu}g/m3,\nrespectively. In particular, the proposed GRNN model obtains the best\nperformance. Furthermore, the mapped PM2.5 distribution retrieved from 3-km\nMODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, agrees quite well with the station\nmeasurements. The results also show that our study has the capacity to provide\nreasonable information for the global monitoring of PM2.5 pollution in China.\n", "  We present a new study of quasi-elastic $W$ and $Z$ scattering processes in\nhigh-energy $e^+e^-$ collisions, based on and extrapolating the low-energy\neffective theory which extends the Standard Model with a 125 GeV Higgs boson.\nBesides parameterizing deviations in terms of the dimension-8 operators that\narise in the effective theory, we also study simplified models of new physics\nin $W/Z$ scattering in terms of scalar and tensor resonance multiplets. The\nhigh-energy asymptotics of all models is regulated by a universal unitarization\nprocedure. This enables us to provide benchmark scenarios which can be\nmeaningfully evaluated off-shell and in exclusive event samples, and to\ndetermine the sensitivity of an $e^+e^-$ collider to the model parameters. We\nanalyze the longitudinal vector boson scattering modes, where we optimize the\ncuts for the fiducial cross section for different collider scenarios. Here, we\nchoose energy stages of 1.0, 1.4 and 3 TeV, as motivated by the extendability\nof the ILC project and the staging scenario of the CLIC project.\n", "  Measuring the time it takes to remove an electron from an atom or molecule\nduring photoionization using newly developed attosecond spectroscopies has been\na focus of many recent experiments. However, the outcome of such measurement\ndepends on measurement protocols and specific observables available in each\nparticular experiment. One of such protocols relies on high harmonic\ngeneration. First, we derive rigorous and general expressions for ionization\nand recombination times in high harmonic generation experiments. We show that\nthese times are different from, but related to ionization times measured in\nphoto-electron spectroscopy, i.e. using attosecond streak camera, RABBITT and\natto-clock methods. Second, we use the Analytical R-Matrix theory (ARM) to\ncalculate these times and compare them with experimental values.\n", "  A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is an exotic state of matter in which electrons'\nspins are quantum entangled over long distances, but do not show\nsymmetry-breaking magnetic order in the zero-temperature limit. The observation\nof QSL states is a central aim of experimental physics, because they host\ncollective excitations that transcend our knowledge of quantum matter; however,\nexamples in real materials are scarce. Here, we report neutron-scattering\nmeasurements on YbMgGaO4, a QSL candidate in which Yb3+ ions with effective\nspin-1/2 occupy a triangular lattice. Our measurements reveal a continuum of\nmagnetic excitations - the essential experimental hallmark of a QSL - at very\nlow temperature (0.06 K). The origin of this peculiar excitation spectrum is a\ncrucial question, because isotropic nearest-neighbor interactions do not yield\na QSL ground state on the triangular lattice. Using measurements of the\nmagnetic excitations close to the field-polarized state, we identify\nantiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions in the presence of planar\nanisotropy as key ingredients for QSL formation in YbMgGaO4.\n", "  In this paper we present a simple discussion on the properties of compact\nstars using an EoS obtained in effective field theory anchored on scale and\nhidden-local symmetric Lagrangian endowed with topology change and a\nunequivocal prediction on the deformation of the compact star, that could be\nmeasured in gravitational waves. The objective is not to offer a superior or\nimproved EoS for compact stars but to confront with a forthcoming astrophysical\nobservable the given model formulated in what is considered to be consistent\nwith the premise of QCD. The model so obtained is found to satisfactorily\ndescribe the observation of a 2-solar mass neutron star with a minimum number\nof parameters. Specifically the observable we are considering in this paper is\nthe tidal deformability parameter (equivalently the Love number k_2), which\naffects gravitational wave forms at the late period of inspiral stage. The\nforthcoming aLIGO and aVirgo observations of gravitational waves from binary\nneutron star system will provide a valuable guidance for arriving at a better\nunderstanding of highly compressed baryonic matter.\n", "  In papers on the history of general relativity and in personal remembrances\nof relativists, keywords like \"renaissance\" and \"golden age\" of general\nrelativity have been used. We try to show that the first label rests on a weak\nempirical basis. The second one, while describing a period of vivid growth in\nresearch in general relativity, exaggerates the importance of this particular\ndevelopment.\n", "  The standard $\\Lambda$-CDM predicts a growth of structures which tends to be\nhigher than the values of redshift space distortion (RSD) measurements, if the\ncosmological parameters are fixed by the CMB data. In this paper we point out\nthat this discrepancy can be resolved/understood if we assume that the graviton\nhas a small but non-zero mass. In the context of the Minimal Theory of Massive\nGravity (MTMG), due to infrared Lorentz violations measurable only at present\ncosmological scales, the graviton acquires a mass without being haunted by\nunwanted extra degrees of freedom. While the so-called self-accelerating branch\nof cosmological solutions in MTMG has the same phenomenology for the background\nas well as the scalar- and vector-type linear perturbations as the\n$\\Lambda$-CDM in General Relativity (GR), it is possible to choose another\nbranch so that the background is the same as that in GR but the evolution of\nmatter perturbations gets modified by the graviton mass. On studying the fit of\nsuch modified dynamics to the above-mentioned RSD measurements, we find that\nthe $\\Lambda$-CDM model is less probable than MTMG by two orders of magnitude.\nWith the help of the cross correlation between the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\neffect and the large scale structure (LSS), the data also pin-down the graviton\nmass squared around $\\mu^2\\approx - (3\\times 10^{-33} \\rm{eV})^2$, which is\nconsistent with the latest bound $|\\mu^2|<(1.2\\times 10^{-22} \\rm{eV})^2$ set\nby the recent LIGO observation.\n", "  The single-mirror small-size telescope (SST-1M) is one of the three proposed\ndesigns for the small-size telescopes (SSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA) project. The SST-1M will be equipped with a 4 m-diameter segmented mirror\ndish and an innovative fully digital camera based on silicon photo-multipliers\n(SiPMs). Since the SST sub-array will consist of up to 70 telescopes, the\nchallenge is not only to build a telescope with excellent performance, but also\nto design it so that its components can be commissioned, assembled and tested\nby industry. In this paper we review the basic steps that led to the design\nconcepts for the SST-1M camera and the ongoing realization of the first\nprototype, with focus on the innovative solutions adopted for the photodetector\nplane and the readout and trigger parts of the camera. In addition, we report\non results of laboratory measurements on real scale elements that validate the\ncamera design and show that it is capable of matching the CTA requirements of\noperating up to high-moon-light background conditions.\n", "  We develop methods to compute holomorphic Yukawa couplings for heterotic\ncompactifications on complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds, generalising\nresults of an earlier paper for Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces. Our methods are based\non constructing the required bundle-valued forms explicitly and evaluating the\nrelevant integrals over the projective ambient space. We also show how our\napproach relates to an earlier, algebraic one to calculate the holomorphic\nYukawa couplings. A vanishing theorem, which we prove, implies that certain\nYukawa couplings allowed by low-energy symmetries are zero due to topological\nreasons. To illustrate our methods, we calculate Yukawa couplings for\nSU(5)-based standard models on a co-dimension two complete intersection\nmanifold.\n", "  The optical spin Hall effect (OSHE) is a transport phenomenon of exciton\npolaritons in semiconductor microcavities, caused by the polaritonic spin-orbit\ninteraction, that leads to the formation of spin textures. In the semiconductor\ncavity, the physical basis of the spin orbit coupling is an effective magnetic\nfield caused by the splitting of transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic\n(TE-TM) modes. The spin textures can be observed in the near field (local spin\ndistribution of polaritons), and as light polarization patterns in the more\nreadily observable far field. For future applications in spinoptronic devices,\na simple and robust control mechanism, which establishes a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between stationary incident light intensity and far-field\npolarization pattern, is needed. We present such a control scheme, which is\nmade possible by a specific double-microcavity design.\n", "  We investigate fractional-charge and fractional-spin errors in\nrange-separated density-functional theory. Specifically, we consider the\nrange-separated hybrid (RSH) method which combines long-range Hartree-Fock (HF)\nexchange with a short-range semilocal exchange-correlation density functional,\nand the RSH+MP2 method which adds long-range second-order M{{\\o}}ller-Plesset\n(MP2) correlation. Results on atoms and molecules show that the\nfractional-charge errors obtained in RSH are much smaller than in the standard\nKohn-Sham (KS) scheme applied with semilocal or hybrid approximations, and also\ngenerally smaller than in the standard HF method. The RSH+MP2 method tends to\nhave smaller fractional-charge errors than standard MP2 for the most diffuse\nsystems, but larger fractional-charge errors for the more compact systems. Even\nthough the individual contributions to the fractional-spin errors in the H atom\ncoming from the short-range exchange and correlation density-functional\napproximations are smaller than the corresponding contributions for the\nfull-range exchange and correlation density-functional approximations, RSH\ngives fractional-spin errors that are larger than in the standard KS scheme and\nonly slightly smaller than in standard HF. Adding long-range MP2 correlation\nonly leads to infinite fractional-spin errors. This work clarifies the\nsuccesses and limitations of range-separated density-functional theory\napproaches for eliminating self-interaction and static-correlation errors.\n", "  We report a new 1-pc (30\") resolution CS($J=2-1$) line map of the central 30\npc of the Galactic Center (GC), made with the Nobeyama 45m telescope. We\nrevisit our previous study of the extraplanar feature called polar arc (PA),\nwhich is a molecular cloud located above SgrA* with a velocity gradient\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane. We find that the PA can be traced back to\nthe Galactic disk. This provides clues of the launching point of the PA ,\nroughly $6\\times10^{6}$ years ago. Implications of the dynamical time scale of\nthe PA might be related to the Galactic Center Lobe (GCL) at parsec scale. Our\nresults suggest that in the central 30 pc of the GC, the feedback from past\nexplosions could alter the orbital path of the molecular gas down to the\ncentral tenth of parsec. In the follow-up work of our new CS($J=2-1$) map, we\nalso find that near the systemic velocity, the molecular gas shows an\nextraplanar hourglass-shaped feature (HG-feature) with a size of $\\sim$13 pc.\nThe latitude-velocity diagrams show that the eastern edge of the HG-feature is\nassociated with an expanding bubble B1, $\\sim$7 pc away from SgrA*. The\ndynamical time scale of this bubble is $\\sim3\\times10^{5}$ years. This bubble\nis interacting with the 50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud. Part of the molecular gas from\nthe 50 km s$^{-1}$ cloud was swept away by the bubble to $b=-0.2deg$. The\nwestern edge of the HG-feature seems to be the molecular gas entrained from the\n20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud towards the north of the Galactic disk. Our results\nsuggest a fossil explosion in the central 30 pc of the GC a few 10$^{5}$ years\nago.\n", "  We show that the detection sensitivity of a linear detector is lower bounded\nby some quantum limits. For the force detection, relevant for atomic force\nmicroscopes, the lower bound is given by the so-called ultimate quantum limit.\nFor the displacement detection, relevant for detecting gravitational waves, a\ngeneralized lower bound is obtained.\n", "  The interaction of light and matter is often described by the exchange of\nsingle excitations. When the coupling strength is a significant fraction of the\nsystem frequencies, the number of excitations are no longer preserved and that\nsimple picture breaks down. This regime is known as the ultrastrong coupling\nregime and is characterized by non-trivial light-matter eigenstates and complex\ndynamics. In this work, we propose to use a an array Josephson junctions to\nincrease the impedance of the light mode enabling ultrastrong coupling to a\ntransmon qubit. We show that the resulting dynamics can be generated and probed\nby taking advantage of the multi-mode structure of the junction array. This\nproposal relies on the frequency tunability of the transmon and, crucially, on\nthe use of a low frequency mode of the array, which allows for non-adiabatic\nchanges of the ground state.\n", "  Magnetic phenomena of the superantiferromagnetic Ising model in both uniform\nlongitudinal ($H$) and transverse ($\\Omega $) magnetic fields are studied by\nemploying a mean-field variational approach based on Peierls-Bogoliubov\ninequality for the free energy. A single-spin cluster is used to get the\napproximate thermodynamic properties of the model. The phase diagrams in the\nmagnetic fields and temperature ($T$) planes, namely, $H-T$ and $\\Omega-T$, are\nanalyzed on an anisotropic square lattice for some values of the ratio\n$\\alpha=J_{y}/J_{x}$, where $J_x$ and $J_y$ are the exchange interactions along\nthe $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively. Depending on the range of the\nHamiltonian parameters, one has only second-order transition lines, only\nfirst-order transition lines, or first- and second-order transition lines with\nthe presence of tricritical points. The corresponding phase diagrams show no\nreentrant behavior along the first-order transition lines at low temperatures.\nThese results are different from those obtained by using Effective Field Theory\nwith the same cluster size.\n", "  Thickness engineered tunneling field-effect transistors (TE-TFET) as a high\nperformance ultra-scaled steep transistor is proposed. This device exploits a\nspecific property of 2D materials: layer thickness dependent energy bandgap\n(Eg). Unlike the conventional hetero-junction TFETs, TE-TFET uses spatially\nvarying layer thickness to form a hetero-junction. This offers advantages by\navoiding the interface states and lattice mismatch problems. Furthermore, it\nboosts the ON-current to 1280$\\mu A/\\mu m$ for 15nm channel length. TE-TFET\nshows a channel length scalability down to 9nm with constant field scaling $E =\nV_{DD}/L_{ch}= 30V/nm$. Providing a higher ON current, phosphorene TE-TFET\noutperforms the homojunction phosphorene TFET and the TMD TFET in terms of\nextrinsic energy-delay product. In this work, the operation principles of\nTE-TFET and its performance sensitivity to the design parameters are\ninvestigated by the means of full-band atomistic quantum transport simulation.\n", "  A problem of a new physical model test given observed experimental data is a\ntypical one for modern experiments of high energy physics (HEP). A solution of\nthe problem may be provided with two alternative statistical formalisms, namely\nfrequentist and Bayesian, which are widely spread in contemporary HEP searches.\nA characteristic experimental situation is modeled from general considerations\nand both the approaches are utilized in order to test a new model. The results\nare juxtaposed, what demonstrates their consistency in this work. An effect of\na systematic uncertainty treatment in the statistical analysis is also\nconsidered.\n", "  Amorphous solids, such as metallic, polymeric, and colloidal glasses, display\ncomplex spatiotemporal response to applied deformations. In contrast to\ncrystalline solids, during loading, amorphous solids exhibit a smooth crossover\nfrom elastic response to plastic flow. In this study, we investigate the\nmechanical response of binary Lennard-Jones glasses to athermal, quasistatic\npure shear as a function of the cooling rate used to prepare them. We find\nseveral key results concerning the connection between strain-induced particle\nrearrangements and mechanical response. We show that more rapidly cooled\nglasses undergo more frequent and larger particle rearrangements than slowly\ncooled glasses. We find that the ratio of the shear to bulk moduli decreases\nwith increasing cooling rate, which suggests that more rapidly cooled glasses\nare more ductile than slowly cooled samples. In addition, we characterized the\ndegree of reversibility of particle motion during cyclic shear. We find that\nirreversible particle motion occurs even in the putative linear regime of\nstress versus strain. However, slowly cooled glasses, which undergo smaller\nrearrangements, are more reversible under cyclic shear than rapidly cooled\nglasses. Thus, we show that more ductile glasses are also less reversible.\n", "  We study certain N=1 preserving deformations of four-dimensional N=2\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) with non-abelian flavor symmetry. The\ndeformation is described by adding an N=1 chiral multiplet transforming in the\nadjoint representation of the flavor symmetry with a superpotential coupling,\nand giving a nilpotent vacuum expectation value to the chiral multiplet which\nbreaks the flavor symmetry. This triggers a renormalization group flow to an\ninfrared SCFT. Remarkably, we find classes of theories flow to enhanced N=2\nsupersymmetric fixed points in the infrared under the deformation. They include\ngeneralized Argyres-Douglas theories and rank-one SCFTs with non-abelian flavor\nsymmetries. Most notably, we find renormalization group flows from the deformed\nconformal SQCDs to the $(A_1, A_n)$ Argyres-Douglas theories. From these\n\"Lagrangian descriptions,\" we compute the full superconformal indices of the\n$(A_1, A_n)$ theories and find agreements with the previous results.\nFurthermore, we study the cases, including the $T_N$ and $R_{0,N}$ theories of\nclass $\\mathcal{S}$ and some of rank-one SCFTs, where the deformation gives\ngenuine N=1 fixed points.\n", "  We examine the phase shifts and inelasticities associated with the\n$N^*(1440)$ Roper resonance and connect these infinite-volume observables to\nthe finite-volume spectrum of lattice QCD using Hamiltonian effective field\ntheory. We explore three hypotheses for the structure of the Roper resonance.\nAll three hypotheses are able to describe the scattering data well. In the\nthird hypothesis the Roper resonance couples the low-lying bare basis-state\ncomponent associated with the ground state nucleon with the virtual\nmeson-baryon contributions. Here the non-trivial superpositions of the\nmeson-baryon scattering states are complemented by bare basis-state components\nexplaining their observation in contemporary lattice QCD calculations. The\nmerit of this scenario lies in its ability to not only describe the observed\nnucleon energy levels in large-volume lattice QCD simulations but also explain\nwhy other low-lying states have been missed in today's lattice QCD results for\nthe nucleon spectrum.\n", "  Control of magnetism without using magnetic fields enables large-scale\nintegration of spintronic devices for memory, computation and communication in\nthe beyond-CMOS era. Mechanisms including spin torque transfer, spin Hall\neffect, and electric field or strain assisted switching have been implemented\nto switch magnetization in various spintronic devices. Their operation speed,\nhowever, is fundamentally limited by the spin precession time to be longer than\n10-100 picoseconds. Overcoming such a speed constraint is critical for the\nprospective development of spintronics. Here we report the demonstration of\npicosecond all-optical switching of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)- the\nbuilding block of spintronic logic and memory -only using single telecom-band,\ninfrared laser pulses. This first optically switchable MTJ uses ferrimagnetic\nGdFeCo as the free layer, and its switching is directly readout by measuring\nits tunneling magnetoresistance with a DR/R ratio of 0.6%. An instrument\nlimited switching repetition rate at MHz has been demonstrated, but the\nfundamental limit should be higher than tens of GHz. This result represents an\nimportant step toward integrated opto-spintronic devices that combines\nspintronics and photonics technologies to enable ultrafast conversion between\nfundamental information carriers of electron spins and photons.\n", "  Understanding international trade is a fundamental problem in economics --\none standard approach is via what is commonly called the \"gravity equation\",\nwhich predicts the total amount of trade $F_ij$ between two countries $i$ and\n$j$ as $$ F_{ij} = G \\frac{M_i M_j}{D_{ij}},$$ where $G$ is a constant, $M_i,\nM_j$ denote the \"economic mass\" (often simply the gross domestic product) and\n$D_{ij}$ the \"distance\" between countries $i$ and $j$, where \"distance\" is a\ncomplex notion that includes geographical, historical, linguistic and\nsociological components. We take the \\textit{inverse} route and ask ourselves\nto which extent it is possible to reconstruct meaningful information about\ncountries simply from knowing the bilateral trade volumes $F_{ij}$: indeed, we\nshow that a remarkable amount of geopolitical information can be extracted. The\nmain tool is a spectral decomposition of the Graph Laplacian as a tool to\nperform nonlinear dimensionality reduction. This may have further applications\nin economic analysis and provides a data-based approach to \"trade distance\".\n", "  Due to the transfer of the angular spectrum of the pump beam to the\ntwo-photon state in spontaneous parametric down-conversion the generated twin\nphotons are entangled in Hermite-Gaussian (HG) modes. This enables one using HG\nmodes as an alphabet for quantum communication. For global quantum\ncommunication purposes, we derive an analytic expression for two-photon\ndetection probability in terms of HG modes taking into account the effects of\nthe turbulent atmosphere. Our result is more general as it accounts for the\npropagation of both, signal and idler photons through the atmosphere, as\nopposed to other works considering one of the photons' propagation in vacuum.\nWe show that while the restrictions on both the parity and order of the\ndown-converted HG fields no longer hold due to the crosstalk between modes when\npropagating in the atmosphere, the crosstalk is not uniform: there are more\nrobust modes that tend to keep the photons in them. These modes can be employed\nin order to increase the fidelity of quantum communication.\n", "  We consider the quantum search problem with a continuous time quantum walk\nfor networks of finite spectral dimension d_{s} of the network Laplacian. For\ngeneral networks of fractal (integer or non-integer) dimension d_{f}, for which\nin general d_{f}\\not=d_{s}, it suggests that d_{s} is the scaling exponent that\ndetermines the computational complexity of the search. Our results are\nconsistent with those of Childs and Goldstone [Phys. Rev. A 70 (2004), 022314]\nfor lattices of integer dimension, where d=d_{f}=d_{s}. For general fractals,\nwe find that the Grover limit of quantum search can be obtained whenever\nd_{s}>4. This complements the recent discussion of mean-field (i.e.,\nd_{s}\\to\\infty) networks by Chakraborty et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016),\n100501] showing that for all those networks spatial search by quantum walk is\noptimal.\n", "  Taking into account simultaneously the Vicsek short range ordering and also\nthe far-field hydrodynamic interactions mediated by the ambient fluid, we\ninvestigate the role of long range interactions in the ordering phenomena in a\nquasi 2-dimensional active suspension. By studying the number fluctuations, the\nvelocity correlation functions and cluster size distribution function, we\nobserve that depending on the number density of swimmers and the strength of\nnoise, the hydrodynamic interactions affect the ordering in a suspension. For a\nfixed value of noise, at large density of particles, long range interactions\nenhance the clustering in the system.\n", "  We study Higgs boson production in association with a top quark and a $W$\nboson at the LHC. At NLO in QCD, $tWH$ interferes with $t\\bar t H$ and a\nprocedure to meaningfully separate the two processes needs to be employed. In\norder to define $tWH$ production for both total rates and differential\ndistributions, we consider the diagram removal and diagram subtraction\ntechniques that have been previously proposed for treating intermediate\nresonances at NLO, in particular in the context of $tW$ production. These\ntechniques feature approximations that need to be carefully taken into account\nwhen theoretical predictions are compared to experimental measurements. To this\naim, we first critically revisit the $tW$ process, for which an extensive\nliterature exists and where an analogous interference with $t \\bar t$\nproduction takes place. We then provide robust results for total and\ndifferential cross sections for $tW$ and $tWH$ at 13 TeV, also matching\nshort-distance events to a parton shower. We formulate a reliable prescription\nto estimate the theoretical uncertainties, including those associated to the\nvery definition of the process at NLO. Finally, we study the sensitivity to a\nnon-Standard-Model relative phase between the Higgs couplings to the top quark\nand to the $W$ boson in $tWH$ production.\n", "  For an elliptic selfadjoint operator $P =-[u^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\n\\partial_\\nu +v^\\nu \\partial_\\nu +w]$ acting on a fiber bundle over a\nRiemannian manifold, where $u,v^\\mu,w$ are $N\\times N$-matrices, we develop a\nmethod to compute the heat-trace coefficients $a_r$ which allows to get them by\na pure computational machinery. It is exemplified in dimension 4 by the value\nof $a_1$ written both in terms of $u,v^\\mu,w$ or diffeomorphic and gauge\ninvariants. We also answer to the question: when is it possible to get explicit\nformulae for $a_r$?\n", "  We study a transform, inspired by coherent state transforms, from the Hilbert\nspace of Clifford algebra valued square integrable functions $L^2({\\mathbb\nR}^m,dx)\\otimes {\\mathbb C}_{m}$ to a Hilbert space of solutions of the Weyl\nequation on ${\\mathbb R}^{m+1}= {\\mathbb R} \\times {\\mathbb R}^m$, namely to\nthe Hilbert space ${\\mathcal M}L^2({\\mathbb R}^{m+1},d\\mu)$ of ${\\mathbb\nC}_m$-valued monogenic functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{m+1}$ which are $L^2$ with\nrespect to an appropriate measure $d\\mu$. We prove that this transform is a\nunitary isomorphism of Hilbert spaces and that it is therefore an analog of the\nSegal-Bargmann transform for Clifford analysis. As a corollary we obtain an\northonormal basis of monogenic functions on ${\\mathbb R}^{m+1}$. We also study\nthe case when ${\\mathbb R}^m$ is replaced by the $m$-torus ${\\mathbb T}^m.$\nQuantum mechanically, this extension establishes the unitary equivalence of the\nSchr\\\"odinger representation on $M$, for $M={\\mathbb R}^m$ and $M={\\mathbb\nT}^m$, with a representation on the Hilbert space ${\\mathcal M}L^2({\\mathbb R}\n\\times M,d\\mu)$ of solutions of the Weyl equation on the space-time ${\\mathbb\nR}\\times M$.\n", "  The recent observation of $X(5568)$ by the D0 Collaboration has aroused a lot\nof interest both theoretically and experimentally. In the present work, we\nfirst point out that $X(5568)$ and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ cannot simultaneously be of\nmolecular nature, from the perspective of heavy-quark symmetry and chiral\nsymmetry, based on a previous study of the lattice QCD scattering lengths of\n$DK$ and its coupled channels. Then we compute the discrete energy levels of\nthe $B_s\\pi$ and $B\\bar{K}$ system in finite volume using unitary chiral\nperturbation theory. The comparison with the latest lattice QCD simulation,\nwhich disfavors the existence of $X(5568)$, supports our picture where the\n$B_s\\pi$ and $B\\bar{K}$ interactions are weak and $X(5568)$ cannot be a\n$B_s\\pi$ and $B\\bar{K}$ molecular state. In addition, we show that the extended\nWeinberg compositeness condition also indicates that $X(5568)$ cannot be a\nmolecular state made from $B_s\\pi$ and $B\\bar{K}$ interactions.\n", "  Diphoton searches at high invariant mass are an integral part of the\nexperimental high energy frontier. Using the analyses of the 750\\,GeV diphoton\nresonance as a case study, we examine the methodology currently employed by the\nexperimental analyses in estimating the dominant standard model backgrounds. We\nassess the dependence of the significance associated with the excess on the\nbackground modeling. In particular, we show that close to the high energy tails\nof the distributions, estimates of the jet faking backgrounds relying on\nfunctional extrapolations or Monte Carlo estimates of the challenging\nphoton-jet contributions introduce a large uncertainty. Analyses with loose\nphoton cuts, low photon $p_T$ cuts and those susceptible to high photon\nrapidity regions are especially affected. Given that diphoton-based searches\nbeyond 1\\,TeV are highly motivated as discovery modes, these considerations are\nrelevant and applicable in the future.\n  We first consider a physics-driven deformation of the shape of the diphoton\nfaking photon-jet spectrum by next-to-leading order effects combined with a\nrapidity and transverse momentum dependent fake rate. We show that the\nresulting local significance of the excess is reduced due to such a\ndeformation. Then using a simple, but more general, ansatz to modify the\ncontribution of the jet faking backgrounds at high invariant masses but keeping\nthe inclusive and differential sample purities within experimental uncertainty\nestimates, we demonstrate that the originally reported local 750\\,GeV excess\nsignificances could have been overestimated by more than one standard\ndeviation. We furthermore cross-check our analysis by comparing fit results\nbased on the smaller 2015 and the larger 2016 LHC datasets. Finally we employ\nour methodology on the complete 13\\,TeV LHC dataset to asses the systematics\ninvolved in the current diphoton searches beyond the TeV region.\n", "  The relations between star formation and properties of molecular clouds are\nstudied based on a sample of star forming regions in the Galactic Plane.\nSources were selected by having radio recombination lines to provide\nidentification of associated molecular clouds and dense clumps. Radio continuum\nand mid-infrared emission were used to determine star formation rates, while\n13CO and submillimeter dust continuum emission were used to obtain masses of\nmolecular and dense gas, respectively. We test whether total molecular gas or\ndense gas provides the best predictor of star formation rate. We also test two\nspecific theoretical models, one relying on the molecular mass divided by the\nfree-fall time, the other using the free-fall time divided by the crossing\ntime. Neither is supported by the data. The data are also compared to those\nfrom nearby star forming regions and extragalactic data. The star formation\n\"efficiency,\" defined as star formation rate divided by mass, spreads over a\nlarge range when the mass refers to molecular gas; the standard deviation of\nthe log of the efficiency decreases by a factor of three when the mass of\nrelatively dense molecular gas is used rather than the mass of all the\nmolecular gas.\n", "  In this paper we utilise the Krori-Barua ansatz to model compact stars within\nthe framework of Einstein- Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. The thrust of our\ninvestigation is to carry out a comparative analysis of the physical properties\nof our models in EGB and classical general relativity theory.\n", "  Axions play a central role in inflationary model building and other\ncosmological applications. This is mainly due to their flat potential, which is\nprotected by a global shift symmetry. However, quantum gravity is known to\nbreak global symmetries, the crucial effect in the present context being\ngravitational instantons or Giddings-Strominger wormholes. We attempt to\nquantify, as model-independently as possible, how large a scalar potential is\ninduced by this general quantum gravity effect. We pay particular attention to\nthe crucial issue which solutions can or cannot be trusted in the presence of a\nmoduli-stabilisation and a Kaluza-Klein scale. An important conclusion is that,\ndue to specific numerical prefactors, the effect is surprisingly small even in\nUV-completions with the highest possible scale offered by string theory.\n  As we go along, we discuss in detail Euclidean wormholes, cored and extremal\ninstantons, and how the latter arise from 5d Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. We\nattempt to dispel possible doubts that wormholes contribute to the scalar\npotential by an explicit calculation. We analyse the role of stabilised\ndilaton-like moduli. Finally, we argue that Euclidean wormholes may be the\nobjects satisfying the Weak Gravity Conjecture extended to instantons.\n", "  The dynamical glass transition is typically taken to be the temperature at\nwhich a glassy liquid is no longer able to equilibrate on experimental\ntimescales. Consequently, the physical properties of these systems just above\nor below the dynamical glass transition, such as viscosity, can change by many\norders of magnitude over long periods of time following external perturbation.\nDuring this progress towards equilibrium, glassy systems exhibit a history\ndependence that has complicated their study. In previous work, we bridged the\ngap between structure and dynamics in glassy liquids above their dynamical\nglass transition temperatures by introducing a scalar field called \"softness\",\na quantity obtained using machine learning methods. Softness is designed to\ncapture the hidden patterns in relative particle positions that correlate\nstrongly with dynamical rearrangements of particle positions. Here we show that\nthe out-of-equilibrium behavior of a model glassforming system can be\nunderstood in terms of softness. To do this we first demonstrate that the\nevolution of behavior following a temperature quench is a primarily structural\nphenomenon: the structure changes considerably, but the relationship between\nstructure and dynamics remains invariant. We then show that the\nhistory-dependent relaxation time can be robustly computed from structure as\nquantified by softness. Together, these results motivate the use of softness to\ncharacterize the history dependence of glasses.\n", "  A photon surface $S$ is defined as a three-dimensional timelike hypersurface\nsuch that any null geodesic initially tangent to $S$ continues to be included\nin $S$, like $r=3M$ of the Schwarzschild spacetime. Using analytic solutions to\nstatic perturbations of a Schwarzschild spacetime, we examine whether a\nnonspherical spacetime can possess a distorted static photon surface. It is\nshown that if the region outside of $r=3M$ is vacuum, no distorted photon\nsurface can be present. Therefore, we establish the perturbative uniqueness for\nan asymptotically flat vacuum spacetime with a static photon surface. It is\nalso pointed out that if matter is present in the outside region, there is a\npossibility that a distorted photon surface could form.\n", "  We demonstrate a Raman laser system based on phase modulation technology and\nphase feedback control. The two laser beams with frequency difference of 6.835\nGHz are modulated using electro-optic and acousto-optic modulators,\nrespectively. Parasitic frequency components produced by the electro-optic\nmodulator are filtered using a Fabry-Perot Etalon. A straightforward phase\nfeedback system restrains the phase noise induced by environmental\nperturbations. The phase noise of the laser system stays below -125 rad2/Hz at\nfrequency offset higher than 500 kHz. Overall phase noise of the laser system\nis evaluated by calculating the contribution of the phase noise to the\nsensitivity limit of a gravimeter. The results reveal that the sensitivity\nlimited by the phase noise of our laser system is lower than that of a\nstate-of-art optical phase-lock loop scheme when a gravimeter operates at short\npulse duration, which makes the laser system a promising option for our future\napplication of atom interferometer.\n", "  Several nonclassical effects displayed by wave packets subject to generic\nnonlinear Hamiltonians can be identified and assessed directly from tomograms\nwithout attempting to reconstruct the Wigner function or the density matrix\nexplicitly. We have demonstrated this for both single-mode and bipartite\nsystems. We have shown that a wide spectrum of effects such as the revival\nphenomena, quadrature squeezing and Hong-Mandel and Hillery type higher-order\nsqueezing in both the single-mode system and the double-well Bose-Einstein\ncondensate can be obtained from appropriate tomograms in a straightforward\nmanner. We have investigated entropic squeezing of the subsystem state of a\nbipartite system as it evolves in time, solely from tomograms. Further we have\nidentified a quantifier of the extent of entanglement between subsystems which\ncan be readily obtained from the tomogram and which mirrors the qualitative\nbehavior of other measures of entanglement such as the subsystem von Neumann\nentropy and the subsystem linear entropy. The procedures that we have\ndemonstrated can be readily adapted to multimode systems.\n", "  The particle-in-cell MCC code NAM-ECRIS is used to simulate the ECRIS plasma\nsustained in a mixture of Kr with O2, N2, Ar, Ne and He. The model assumes that\nions are electrostatically confined in ECR zone by a dip in the plasma\npotential. Gain in the extracted krypton ion currents is seen for the highest\ncharge states; the gain is maximized when oxygen is used as the mixing gas. A\nspecial feature of oxygen is that most of singly charged oxygen ions are\nproduced after dissociative ionization of oxygen molecules with the large\nkinetic energy release of around 5 eV per ion. Increased loss rate of energetic\nlowly charged ions of the mixing element requires building up of the retarding\npotential barrier close to ECR surface to equilibrate electron and ion losses\nout of the plasma. In the mixed plasmas, the barrier value is large (~1 V)\ncompared to the pure Kr plasma (~0.01 V), with the longer confinement times of\nkrypton ions and with the much higher ion temperatures.\n", "  Current regulations demand that at least two exits should be available for a\nsafe evacuation during a panic situation. Although the \"faster is slower\"\neffect is expected to take place near the exits, the evacuation time will\nimprove because of the additional exits. However, rooms having contiguous doors\nnot always reduce the leaving time as expected. We investigated the relation\nbetween the doors separation and the evacuation performance. We found that\nthere exists a separation distance range that does not really improve the\nevacuation time, or it can even worsen the process performance. To our\nknowledge, no attention has been given to this issue in the literature. This\nwork reports how the pedestrians dynamics differ when the separation distance\nbetween two exit doors changes and how this affects the overall performance.\n", "  High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with Hitomi was expected to resolve the\norigin of the faint unidentified E=3.5 keV emission line reported in several\nlow-resolution studies of various massive systems, such as galaxies and\nclusters, including the Perseus cluster. We have analyzed the Hitomi\nfirst-light observation of the Perseus cluster. The emission line expected for\nPerseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the\ndark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.\nHowever, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high\ncompared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the\nreported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties\nfor this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for a\nbroad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas. We do not\nfind anomalously high fluxes of the nearby faint K line or the Ar satellite\nline that were proposed as explanations for the earlier 3.5 keV detections. We\ndo find a hint of a broad excess near the energies of high-n transitions of\nSxvi (E=3.44 keV rest-frame) -- a possible signature of charge exchange in the\nmolecular nebula and another proposed explanation for the unidentified line.\nWhile its energy is consistent with XMM pn detections, it is unlikely to\nexplain the MOS signal. A confirmation of this interesting feature has to wait\nfor a more sensitive observation with a future calorimeter experiment.\n", "  We study a model of two dimensional, topological superconductivity on a\nsquare lattice. The model contains hopping, spin orbit coupling and a time\nreversal symmetry breaking Zeeman term. This term, together with the chemical\npotential act as knobs that induce transitions between trivial and topological\nsuperconductivity. As previously found numerically, the transitions are seen in\nthe entanglement entropy as cusps as a function of model parameters. In this\nwork we study the entanglement entropy analytically by keeping only its most\nimportant components. Our study is based on the intuition that the number of\nFermi surfaces in the system controls the topological invariant. With our\napproximate expression for the entanglement entropy we are able to extract the\ndivergent entanglement entropy derivative close to the phase transition.\n", "  We prove the renormalizability to all orders of a refined Gribov-Zwanziger\ntype action in linear covariant gauges in four-dimensional Euclidean space. In\nthis model, the Gribov copies are taken into account by requiring that the\nFaddeev-Popov operator is positive definite with respect to the transverse\ncomponent of the gauge field, a procedure which turns out to be analogous to\nthe restriction to the Gribov region in the Landau gauge. The model studied\nhere can be regarded as the first approximation of a more general\nnonperturbative BRST invariant formulation of the refined Gribov-Zwanziger\naction in linear covariant gauges obtained recently in [Phys. Rev. D 92, no. 4,\n045039 (2015) and arXiv:1605.02610 [hep-th]]. A key ingredient of the set up\nworked out in [Phys. Rev. D 92, no. 4, 045039 (2015) and arXiv:1605.02610\n[hep-th]] is the introduction of a gauge invariant field configuration\n$\\mathbf{A}_{\\mu}$ which can be expressed as an infinite non-local series in\nthe starting gauge field $A_\\mu$. In the present case, we consider the\napproximation in which only the first term of the series representing\n$\\mathbf{A}_{\\mu}$ is considered, corresponding to a pure transverse gauge\nfield. The all order renormalizability of the resulting action gives thus a\nstrong evidence of the renormalizability of the aforementioned more general\nnonperturbative BRST invariant formulation of the Gribov horizon in linear\ncovariant gauges.\n", "  Synthesis of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state --- the primary\nentangled resource in continuous-variable quantum-optical information\nprocessing --- is a technological challenge of great importance. Here we\npropose and implement a new scheme of generating this state. Two nonlinear\noptical crystals, positioned back-to-back in the waist of a pump beam, function\nas single-pass degenerate optical parametric amplifiers and produce single-mode\nsqueezed vacuum states in orthogonal polarization modes, but in the same\nspatiotemporal mode. A subsequent pair of waveplates acts as a beam splitter,\nentangling the two polarization modes to generate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nstate. This technique takes advantage of the strong nonlinearity associated\nwith type-I phase-matching configuration while at the same time eliminating the\nneed for actively stabilizing the optical phase between the two squeezers,\nwhich typically arises if these squeezers are spatially separated. We\ndemonstrate our method in an experiment, preparing a 1.4 dB two-mode squeezed\nstate and characterizing it via two-mode homodyne tomography.\n", "  An approximation to the added mass matrix of an assembly of spheres is\nconstructed on the basis of potential flow theory for situations where one\nsphere is much larger than the others. In the approximation the flow potential\nnear a small sphere is assumed to be dipolar, but near the large sphere it\ninvolves all higher order multipoles. The analysis is based on an exact result\nfor the potential of a magnetic dipole in the presence of a superconducting\nsphere. Subsequently, the approximate added mass hydrodynamic interactions are\nused in a calculation of the swimming velocity and rate of dissipation of\nlinear chain structures consisting of a number of small spheres and a single\nlarge one, with account also of frictional hydrodynamic interactions. The\nresults derived for periodic swimming on the basis of a kinematic approach are\ncompared with bilinear theory, valid for small amplitude of stroke, and with\nthe numerical solution of the approximate equations of motion. The calculations\ncover the whole range of scale number between the friction-dominated Stokes\nlimit and the inertia-dominated regime.\n", "  In recent years, a growing interest on the equilibrium of compact\nastrophysical objects like white dwarf and neutron stars has been manifested.\nIn particular, various modifications due to Planck scale energy effects have\nbeen considered. In this paper we analyze the modification induced by Gravity's\nRainbow on the equilibrium configurations described by the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. Our purpose is to explore the\npossibility that the Rainbow Planck-scale deformation of space-time could\nsupport the existence of different compact stars.\n", "  We study maximally supersymmetric solutions of all gauged or deformed\nsupergravity theories in $D \\ge 3$ space-time dimensions. For vanishing\nbackground fluxes the space-time background has to be either Minkowski or\nanti-de Sitter. We derive a simple criterion for the existence of solutions\nwith non-trivial fluxes and determine all supergravities that satisfy it. We\nshow that their solutions coincide with those of the corresponding ungauged\ntheories and conclude that the known list of maximally supersymmetric solutions\nis exhaustive.\n", "  A detailed Monte Carlo calculation of the phase diagram of bosonic IKKT\nYang-Mills matrix models in three and six dimensions with quartic mass\ndeformations is given. Background emergent fuzzy geometries in two and four\ndimensions are observed with a fluctuation given by a noncommutative $U(1)$\ngauge theory very weakly coupled to normal scalar fields. The geometry, which\nis determined dynamically, is given by the fuzzy spheres ${\\bf S}^2_N$ and\n${\\bf S}^2_N\\times{\\bf S}^2_N$ respectively. The three and six matrix models\nare in the same universality class with some differences. For example, in two\ndimensions the geometry is completely stable, whereas in four dimensions the\ngeometry is stable only in the limit $M\\longrightarrow \\infty$, where $M$ is\nthe mass of the normal fluctuations. The behavior of the eigenvalue\ndistribution in the two theories is also different. We also sketch how we can\nobtain a stable fuzzy four-sphere ${\\bf S}^2_N\\times{\\bf S}^2_N$ in the large\n$N$ limit for all values of $M$ as well as models of topology change in which\nthe transition between spheres of different dimensions is observed. The stable\nfuzzy spheres in two and four dimensions act precisely as regulators which is\nthe original goal of fuzzy geometry and fuzzy physics. Fuzzy physics and fuzzy\nfield theory on these spaces are briefly discussed.\n", "  The relic abundance of the dark matter (DM) particle $d$ is studied in a\nsecluded DM scenario, in which the $d$ number decreasing process dominantly\noccurs not through the pair annihilation of $d$ into the standard model\nparticles, but via the $dd \\to mm$ scattering process with a subsequently\ndecaying mediator particle $m$. It is pointed out that the cosmologically\nobserved relic abundance of DM can be accomplished even with a massive mediator\nhaving a mass $m_m$ non-negligibly heavy compared with the DM particle mass\n$m_d$. In the degenerated $d$-$m$ case ($m_d=m_m$), the DM relic abundance is\nrealized by adjusting the $dd \\to mm$ scattering amplitude large enough and by\nchoosing an appropriate mediator particle life-time. The DM evolution in the\nearly universe exhibits characteristic \"terrace\" behavior, or two-step number\ndensity decreasing behavior, having a \"fake\" freeze-out at the first step.\nBased on these observations, a novel possibility of the DM model buildings is\nintroduced in which the mediator particle $m$ is unified with the DM particle\n$d$ in an approximate dark symmetry multiplet. A pionic DM model is proposed to\nillustrate this idea in a renormalizable field theory framework.\n", "  An algorithmic method to exploit a general class of infinitesimal symmetries\nfor reducing stochastic differential equations is presented and a natural\ndefinition of reconstruction, inspired by the classical reconstruction by\nquadratures, is proposed. As a side result the well-known solution formula for\nlinear one-dimensional stochastic differential equations is obtained within\nthis symmetry approach. The complete procedure is applied to several examples\nwith both theoretical and applied relevance.\n", "  The relationships between quantum entangled states and braid matrices have\nbeen well studied in recent years. However, most of the results are based on\nqubits. In this paper, We investigate the applications of 2-qutrit entanglement\nin the braiding associated with $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion. The 2-qutrit\nentangled state $|\\Psi(\\theta)\\rangle$, generated by acting the localized\nunitary solution $\\breve{R}(\\theta)$ of YBE on 2-qutrit natural basis, achieves\nits maximal $\\ell_1$-norm and maximal von Neumann entropy simultaneously at\n$\\theta=\\pi/3$. Meanwhile, at $\\theta=\\pi/3$, the solutions of YBE reduces\nbraid matrices, which implies the role of $\\ell_1$-norm and entropy plays in\ndetermining real physical quantities. On the other hand, we give a new\nrealization of 4-anyon topological basis by qutrit entangled states, then the\n$9\\times9$ localized braid representation in 4-qutrit tensor product space\n$(\\mathbb{C}^3)^{\\otimes 4}$ are reduced to Jones representation of braiding in\nthe 4-anyon topological basis. Hence, we conclude that the entangled states are\npowerful tools in analysing the characteristics of braiding and\n$\\breve{R}$-matrix.\n", "  We have found that the minimum energy configuration of $N=395$ charges\nconfined in a disk and interacting via the Coulomb potential, reported by\nCerkaski et al. in Ref.~\\cite{Cerkaski15} is not a global minimum of the total\nelectrostatic energy. We have identified a large number of configurations with\nlower energy, where defects are present close to the center of the disk; thus,\nthe formation of a hexagonal core and valence circular rings for the centered\nconfigurations, predicted by the model of Ref.~\\cite{Cerkaski15}, is not\nsupported by numerical evidence and the configurations obtained with this model\ncannot be used as a guide for the numerical calculations, as claimed by the\nauthors.\n", "  We study a Gaussian matrix function of the adjacency matrix of artificial and\nreal-world networks. In particular, we study the Gaussian Estrada index---an\nindex characterizing the importance of eigenvalues close to zero. This index\naccounts for the information contained in the eigenvalues close to zero in the\nspectra of networks. Here we obtain bounds for this index in simple graphs,\nproving that it reaches its maximum for star graphs followed by complete\nbipartite graphs. We also obtain formulas for the Estrada Gaussian index of\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs as well as for the Barab\\'asi-Albert graphs. We\nalso show that in real-world networks this index is related to the existence of\nimportant structural patterns, such as complete bipartite subgraphs\n(bicliques). Such bicliques appear naturally in many real-world networks as a\nconsequence of the evolutionary processes giving rise to them. In general, the\nGaussian matrix function of the adjacency matrix of networks characterizes\nimportant structural information not described in previously used matrix\nfunctions of graphs.\n", "  Homogenization of a thin micro-structure yields effective jump conditions\nthat incorporate the geometrical features of the scatterers. These jump\nconditions apply across a thin but nonzero thickness interface whose interior\nis disregarded. This paper aims (i) to propose a numerical method able to\nhandle the jump conditions in order to simulate the homogenized problem in the\ntime domain, (ii) to inspect the validity of the homogenized problem when\ncompared to the real one. For this purpose, we adapt an immersed interface\nmethod originally developed for standard jump conditions across a\nzero-thickness interface. Doing so allows us to handle arbitrary-shaped\ninterfaces on a Cartesian grid with the same efficiency and accuracy of the\nnumerical scheme than those obtained in an homogeneous medium. Numerical\nexperiments are performed to test the properties of the numerical method and to\ninspect the validity of the homogenization problem.\n", "  We have developed a drift-diffusion equation of spin transport in collinear\nbipartite metallic antiferromagnets. Starting from a model tight-binding\nHamiltonian, we obtain the quantum kinetic equation within Keldysh formalism\nand expand it to the lowest order in spatial gradient using Wigner expansion\nmethod. In the diffusive limit, these equations track the spatio-temporal\nevolution of the spin accumulations and spin currents on each sublattice of the\nantiferromagnet. We use these equations to address the nature of spin transfer\ntorque in (i) a spin-valve composed of a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet,\n(ii) a metallic bilayer consisting in an antiferromagnet adjacent to a heavy\nmetal possessing spin Hall effect, and in (ii) a single antiferromagnet\npossessing spin Hall effect. We show that the latter can experience a\nself-torque thanks to the non-vanishing spin Hall effect in the\nantiferromagnet.\n", "  In the continuum flow regime, the Navier-Stokes equations are usually used\nfor the description of gas dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann equation\nis applied for the rarefied gas dynamics. Both equations are constructed from\nmodeling flow physics in different scales. Fortunately, due to the distinct\nseparation of scales, i.e., the hydrodynamic and kinetic ones, both\nNavier-Stokes equations and the Boltzmann equation are valid in their\nrespectable domains. However, in real physical application, there may not have\nsuch a distinctive scale separation. For example, around a hypersonic flying\nvehicle, the flow physics at different regions may correspond to different\nregimes, where the local Knudsen number can be changed in several order of\nmagnitudes. With a variation of modeling scale, theoretically a continuous\ngoverning equation from kinetic Boltzmann equation to the hydrodynamic\nNavier-Stokes equations should exist. However, due to the difficulties of a\ndirect modeling of flow physics in the scale between the kinetic and\nhydrodynamic ones, there is basically no reliable theory or valid governing\nequation to cover the whole transition regime. In fact, it is an unresolved\nproblem about the exact scale for the validity of the NS equations as Reynolds\nnumber decreases. The traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based\non the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE), and it\ntargets on the recovering of the exact solution of the PDEs as mesh size and\ntime step converging to zero. This methodology can be hardly applied here\nbecause there is no such a complete PDE for flow physics in all scales. It may\nbe the time to combine the modeling and computation together without going\nthrough the process of constructing PDEs. In other words, the CFD research is\nnot only to obtain the numerical solution of governing equation, but also to\nconstruct a valid discrete governing equation to identify the flow physics in\nthe mesh size and time step scales. In this paper, we are going to present the\nidea for the modeling and computation. This methodology leads to the unified\ngas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for flow simulation in all flow regimes. Based on\nUGKS, the boundary for the validation of the Navier-Stokes equations can be\nquantitatively evaluated. The combination of modeling and computation provides\na paradigm for the description of multiscale transport process.\n", "  We investigate the relativistic breakout of a shock wave from the surface of\na star. In this process, each fluid shell is endowed with some kinetic and\nthermal energy by the shock, and then continues to accelerate adiabatically by\nconverting thermal energy into kinetic energy. This problem has been previously\nstudied for a mildly relativistic breakout, where the acceleration ends close\nto the surface of the star. The current work focuses on the case where the\nacceleration ends at distances much greater than the radius of the star. We\nderive an analytic description for the hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta in\nthis regime, and validate it using a numerical simulation. We also provide\npredictions for the expected light curves and spectra from such an explosion.\nThe relevance to astrophysical explosions is discussed, and it is shown that\nsuch events require more energy than is currently believed to result from\nastrophysical explosions.\n", "  Using the method of simple current extensions, asymmetric Gepner models of\nType IIB with N=1 space-time supersymmetry are constructed. The combinatorics\nof the massless vector fields suggests that these classical Minkowski string\nvacua provide fully backreacted solutions corresponding to N=1 minima of N=2\ngauged supergravity. The latter contain abelian gaugings along the axionic\nisometries in the hypermultiplet moduli space, and can be considered as Type\nIIB flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds equipped with\n(non-)geometric fluxes. For a particular class of asymmetric Gepner models, we\nare able to explicitly specify the underlying CICYs and to check necessary\nconditions for a GSUGRA interpretation. If this conjecture is correct, there\nexists a large class of exactly solvable non-geometric flux compactifications\non CY threefolds.\n", "  We present a construction of a new integrable model as an infinite limit of\nCalogero models of N particles with spin. It is implemented in the\nmulticomponent Fock space. Explicit formulas for Dunkl operators, the Yangian\ngenerators in the multicomponent Fock space are presented. The classical limit\nof the system is examined.\n", "  We perform a parameter scan of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (pMSSM) with eight parameters taking into account the\nexperimental Higgs boson results from Run I of the LHC and further low-energy\nobservables. We investigate various MSSM interpretations of the Higgs signal at\n125 GeV. First, we consider the case where the light CP-even Higgs boson of the\nMSSM is identified with the discovered Higgs boson. In this case it can\nimpersonate the SM Higgs-like signal either in the decoupling limit, or in the\nlimit of alignment without decoupling. In the latter case, the other states in\nthe Higgs sector can also be light, offering good prospects for upcoming LHC\nsearches and for searches at future colliders. Second, we demonstrate that the\nheavy CP-even Higgs boson is still a viable candidate to explain the Higgs\nsignal - albeit only in a highly constrained parameter region, that will be\nprobed by LHC searches for the CP-odd Higgs boson and the charged Higgs boson\nin the near future. As a guidance for such searches we provide new benchmark\nscenarios that can be employed to maximize the sensitivity of the experimental\nanalysis to this interpretation.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the transfer of angular momentum between a spin\nsuperfluid and a domain wall in an exchange coupled easy-axis and easy-plane\nmagnetic insulator system. A domain wall in the easy-axis magnet absorbs spin\nangular momentum via disrupting the flow of a superfluid spin current in the\neasy-plane magnet. Focusing on an open geometry, where the spin current is\ninjected electrically via a nonequilibrium spin accumulation, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the resultant superfluid-mediated motion of the\ndomain wall. The analytical results are supported by micromagnetic simulations.\nThe proposed phenomenon extends the regime of magnon-driven domain-wall motion\nto the case when the magnons are condensed and exhibit superfluidity.\nFurthermore, by controlling the pinning of the domain wall, we propose a\nrealization of a reconfigurable spin transistor. The long-distance\ndissipationless character of spin superfluids can thus be exploited for\nmanipulating soliton-based memory and logic devices.\n", "  We consider the electromagnetic scattering from a convex polyhedral PEC or\nPMC obstacle due to a time-harmonic incident plane wave. It is shown that the\nmodulus of the far-field pattern in the backscattering aperture possesses a\ncertain local maximum behavior. Using the local maximum indicating phenomena,\none can determine the exterior unit normal directions, as well as the face\nareas, of the front faces of the obstacle. Then we propose a recovery scheme of\nreconstructing the obstacle by phaseless backscattering measurements. This work\nsignificantly extends our recent study in [12] from two dimensions and acoustic\nscattering to the much more challenging three dimensions and electromagnetic\nscattering.\n", "  The effective entrapment of Carbon dots (CDs) into a polymer-silica hybrid\nmatrix, formed as free standing transparent flexible films, is presented. CDs\nof 3 nm mean size with strong photoluminescence are embedded into a silica\nmatrix during the sol-gel procedure, using tetraethylorthosilicate and F127\ntriblock copolymer as the structure directing agent under acidic conditions.\nThe final hybrid nanostructure forms free standing transparent films that show\nhigh flexibility and long term stable CDs luminescence indicating the\nprotective character of the hybrid matrix. It is crucial that the\nphotoluminescence of the hybrid's CDs is not seriously affected after thermal\ntreatment at 550C for 30min. Moreover, the herein reported hybrid is\ndemonstrated to be suitable for the fabrication of advanced photonic structures\nusing soft lithography process due to its low shrinkage and distortion upon\ndrying.\n", "  In this work I present the interpretation of the ATLAS search of same-sign\nlepton production in association with $b$-jets in the context of the 4-top\nquark signal from sgluon decays. I show that using just 3.2/fb data sample from\nRun 2 the exclusion limit is already competitive with the Run 1 one. Public\ndata allow to exclude sgluons with masses up to 0.95 TeV. Prospects for the\ntotal Run 2 integrated luminosity of 100/fb are briefly discussed.\n", "  We propose a new method for absolute momentum calibration of magnetic\nspectrometers used in nuclear physics, using the time-of-flight (TOF),\ndifferences of pairs of particles with different masses. In cases where the\nflight path is not known, a calibration can be determined by using the TOF\ndifferences of two pair combinations of three particles. A Cherenkov detector,\nread out by a radio frequency photomultiplier tube, is considered as the\nhigh-resolution and highly stable TOF detector. By means of Monte Carlo\nsimulations it is demonstrated that the magnetic spectrometers at the MAMI\nelectron-scattering facility can be calibrated absolutely with an accuracy\n$\\delta p/p\\leq 10^{-4}$, which will be crucial for high precision\ndetermination of hypernuclear masses.\n", "  Steady-state thermal transport in nanostructures with dimensions comparable\nto the phonon mean-free-path is examined. Both the case of contacts at\ndifferent temperatures with no internal heat generation and contacts at the\nsame temperature with internal heat generation are considered. Fourier's Law\nresults are compared to finite volume method solutions of the phonon Boltzmann\nequation in the gray approximation. When the boundary conditions are properly\nspecified, results obtained using Fourier's Law without modifying the bulk\nthermal conductivity are in essentially exact quantitative agreement with the\nphonon Boltzmann equation in the ballistic and diffusive limits. The errors\nbetween these two limits are examined in this paper. For the four cases\nexamined, the error in the apparent thermal conductivity as deduced from a\ncorrect application of Fourier's Law is less than 6%. We also find that the\nFourier's Law results presented here are nearly identical to those obtained\nfrom a widely-used ballistic-diffusive approach, but analytically much simpler.\nAlthough limited to steady-state conditions with spatial variations in one\ndimension and to a gray model of phonon transport, the results show that\nFourier's Law can be used for linear transport from the diffusive to the\nballistic limit. The results also contribute to an understanding of how heat\ntransport at the nanoscale can be understood in terms of the conceptual\nframework that has been established for electron transport at the nanoscale.\n", "  The derivation of the Hartree equation from many-body systems of Bosons in\nthe mean field limit has been very intensively studied in the last couple of\nyears. However, very few results exist showing convergence of the k-th marginal\nof the N-body density matrix to the projection to the k-fold tensor product of\nthe solution of the Hartree equation in stronger trace norms like the energy\ntrace norm, see \\cite{MS}, \\cite{Lu}. This issue is from a physical view point\nvery important. The reason is that one can then approximate expectation values\nof certain observables of the N-body system by means of the Hartree equation,\nwith relaxation of the very restrictive assumption that the observables are\nbounded operators. Here we consider the non-relativistic case. We prove,\nassuming only H^1-regularity of the initial data, convergence in the energy\ntrace norm without rates, and convergence in any other weaker Sobolev trace\nnorm with rates. Our proof is simple and uses the functional $a_N$ introduced\nby Pickl in \\cite{Pi}.\n", "  The first computation of Higgs production in association with three jets at\nNLO in QCD has recently been performed using the effective theory, where the\ntop quark is treated as an infinitely heavy particle and integrated out. This\napproach is restricted to the regions in phase space where the typical scales\nare not larger than the top quark mass. Here we investigate this statement at a\nquantitative level by calculating the leading-order contributions to the\nproduction of a Standard Model Higgs boson in association with up to three jets\ntaking full top-quark and bottom-quark mass dependence into account. We find\nthat the transverse momentum of the hardest particle or jet plays a key role in\nthe breakdown of the effective theory predictions, and that discrepancies can\neasily reach an order of magnitude for transverse momenta of about 1 TeV. The\nimpact of bottom-quark loops are found to be visible in the small transverse\nmomentum region, leading to corrections of up to 5 percent. We further study\nthe impact of mass corrections when VBF selection cuts are applied and when the\ncenter-of-mass energy is increased to 100 TeV.\n", "  In this article we study a nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (nNJL) model with a\nGaussian regulator in presence of a uniform magnetic field. We take a mixed\napproach to the incorporation of temperature in the model, and consider aspects\nof both real and imaginary time formalisms. We include confinement in the model\nthrough the quasiparticle interpretation of the poles of the propagator. The\neffect of the magnetic field in the deconfinement phase transition is then\nstudied. It is found that, like with chiral symmetry restoration, magnetic\ncatalysis occurs for the deconfinement phase transition. It is also found that\nthe magnetic field enhances the thermodynamical instability of the system. We\nwork in the weak field limit, i.e. $(eB)<5m_\\pi^2$. At this level there is no\nsplitting of the critical temperatures for chiral and deconfinement phase\ntransitions.\n", "  It is known that the linearly polarized photons can partly transform to\ncircularly polarized ones via forward Compton scattering in a background such\nas the external magnetic field or noncommutative space time. Based on this fact\nwe explore the effects of the NC-background on the scattering of a linearly\npolarized laser beam from an intense beam of charged leptons. We show that for\na muon/electron beam flux $\\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mu,e}\\sim 10^{12}/10^{10}\\,{\\rm\nTeV}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}\\,{\\rm sec}^{-1}$ and a linearly polarized laser beam with\nenergy $k^0\\sim $1 eV and average power $\\bar{P}_{\\rm laser}\\simeq$1 MW, the\ngeneration rate of circularly polarized photons is about $R_{_V} \\sim 10^4/{\\rm\nsec}$ for Noncommutative energy scale $\\Lambda_{\\tiny{NC}}\\sim 10$TeV.\n  This is fairly large and can grow for more intense beams in near future.\n", "  Disordered systems are characterized by the existence of many sample-\ndependent local energy minima, that cause a stepwise response when the system\nis perturbed. In this article we use an approach based on elementary\nprobabilistic methods to compute the complete probability distribution of the\njumps (static avalanches) in the response of mean-field systems described by\nreplica symmetry breaking; we find a precise condition for having a power-law\nbehavior in the distribution of avalanches caused by small perturbations, and\nwe show that our predictions are in remarkable agreement both with previous\nresults and with what is found in simulations of three dimensional systems of\nsoft-spheres, either at jamming or at slightly higher densities.\n", "  The elucidation of the nature of new phenomena requires a multi-pronged\napproach to understand the essential physics that underlies it. As an example,\nwe study the simplified model containing a new scalar singlet accompanied by\nvector-like quarks, as motivated by the recent diphoton excess at the LHC. To\nbe specific, we investigate three models with $SU(2)_L$-doublet, vector-like\nquarks with Yukawa couplings to a new scalar singlet and which also couple\noff-diagonally to corresponding Standard Model fermions of the first or third\ngeneration through the usual Higgs boson. We demonstrate that three classes of\nsearches can play important and complementary roles in constraining this model.\nIn particular, we find that missing energy searches designed for superparticle\nproduction, supply superior sensitivity for vector-like quarks than the\ndedicated new quark searches themselves.\n", "  Taylor's swimming sheet is a classical model of microscale propulsion and\npumping. Many biological fluids and substances are fibrous, having a preferred\ndirection in their microstructure; for example cervical mucus is formed of\npolymer molecules which create an oriented fibrous network. Moreover,\nsuspensions of elongated motile cells produce a form of active oriented matter.\nTo understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion, we extend Taylor's\nclassical model of small-amplitude zero-Reynolds-number propulsion of a\n'swimming sheet' via the transversely-isotropic fluid model of Ericksen, which\nis linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction. The energetic\ncosts of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and\nthe initial fibre angle. Propulsion in a passive transversely-isotropic fluid\nproduces an enhanced mean rate of working, independent of the initial fibre\norientation, with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the\nextensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres. In this\nregime the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the Newtonian case. The\neffect of the constant term in Ericksen's model for the stress, which can be\nidentified as a fibre tension or alternatively a stresslet characterising an\nactive fluid, is also considered. This stress introduces an angular dependence\nand dramatically changes the streamlines and flow field; fibres aligned with\nthe swimming direction increase the energetic demands of the sheet. The\nconstant fibre stress may result in a reversal of the mean swimming velocity\nand a negative mean rate of working if sufficiently large relative to the other\nrheological parameters.\n", "  Quantum electrodynamics in very strong Coulomb fields is one scope which has\nnot yet been tested experimentally with suffcient accuracy to really determine\nwhether the perturbative approach is valid. One sensitive test is the\ndetermination of the 1s Lamb Shift in highly-charged very heavy ions. The 1s\nLamb Shift of hydrogen-like lead (Pb81+) and gold (Au78+) has been determined\nusing the novel detector concept of silicon microcalorimeters for the detection\nof hard X-rays. The results of (260 +- 22) eV for lead and (208 +- 13) eV for\ngold are within error bars in good agreement with theoretical predictions. For\nhydrogen-like lead, this represents the most accurate determination of the 1s\nLamb Shift to our knowledge.\n", "  The high temperature superconductivity in single-unit-cell (1UC) FeSe on\nSrTiO3 (STO)(001) and the observation of replica bands by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) have led to the conjecture that the coupling\nbetween FeSe electron and the STO phonon is responsible for the enhancement of\nTc over other FeSe-based superconductors1,2. However the recent observation of\na similar superconducting gap in FeSe grown on the (110) surface of STO raises\nthe question of whether a similar mechanism applies3,4. Here we report the\nARPES study of the electronic structure of FeSe grown on STO(110). Similar to\nthe results in FeSe/STO(001), clear replica bands are observed. We also present\na comparative study of STO (001) and STO(110) bare surfaces, where photo doping\ngenerates metallic surface states. Similar replica bands separating from the\nmain band by approximately the same energy are observed, indicating this\ncoupling is a generic feature of the STO surfaces and interfaces. Our findings\nsuggest that the large superconducting gaps observed in FeSe films grown on two\ndifferent STO surface terminations are likely enhanced by a common coupling\nbetween FeSe electrons and STO phonons.\n", "  The understanding of water transport in graphene oxide (GO) membranes stands\nout as a major theoretical problem in graphene research. Notwithstanding the\nintense efforts devoted to the subject in the recent years, a consolidated\npicture of water transport in GO membranes is yet to emerge. By performing\nmesoscale simulations of water transport in ultrathin GO membranes, we show\nthat even small amounts of oxygen functionalities can lead to a dramatic drop\nof the GO permeability, in line with experimental findings. The coexistence of\nbulk viscous dissipation and spatially extended molecular friction results in a\nmajor decrease of both slip and bulk flow, thereby suppressing the fast water\ntransport regime observed in pristine graphene nanochannels. Inspection of the\nflow structure reveals an inverted curvature in the near-wall region, which\nconnects smoothly with a parabolic profile in the bulk region. Such inverted\ncurvature is a distinctive signature of the coexistence between single-particle\nLangevin friction and collective hydrodynamics. The present mesoscopic model\nwith spatially extended friction may offer a computationally efficient tool for\nfuture simulations of water transport in nanomaterials.\n", "  Spin transfer torque in magnetic structures occurs when the transverse\ncomponent of the spin current that flows from the nonmagnetic medium to\nferromagnetic medium are absorbed by the interface. In this paper, considering\nthe Rashba effect on semiconductor region, we have discussed the spin transfer\ntorque in semiconductor/ferromagnetic structure and obtained the components of\nspin-current density for two models: (I)-single electron and (II)- the\ndistribution of electrons. We have shown that whatever the difference between\nFermi surfaces in semiconductor and Fermi spheres for the up and down spins in\nferromagnetic increase, the transmission probability decreases. The obtained\nresults for the values used in this article illustrate that Rashba effect\nincreases the difference between a Fermi sphere in semiconductors and Fermi\nsphere for the up and down spins in ferromagnetic. The results also show that\nthe Rashba effect, brings an additional contribution to the components of spin\ntransfer torque, which is not exist in the absence of the Rashba interaction.\nMoreover, the Rashba term has also different effects on the transverse\ncomponents of the spin torque transfer.\n", "  We use a cooled Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) to electron motion in\nnanoscale devices. The charged tip of the SPM is raster scanned at a constant\nheight above the surface as the conductance of the device is measured. The\nimage charge scatters electrons away, changing the path of electrons through\nthe sample.1-3 Using this technique, we have imaged cyclotron orbits3 for\nballistic hBN-graphene-hBN devices that flow between two narrow contacts in the\nmagnetic focusing regime. Here we present an analysis of our magnetic focusing\nimaging results based on the effects of the tip-created charge density dip on\nthe motion of ballistic electrons. The density dip locally reduces the Fermi\nenergy, creating a force that pushes electrons away from the tip. When the tip\nis above the cyclotron orbit, electrons are deflected away from the receiving\ncontact, creating an image by reducing the transmission between contacts. The\ndata and our analysis suggest that graphene edge is rather rough, and electrons\nscattering off the edge bounce in random directions. However, when the tip is\nclose to the edge it can enhance transmission by bouncing electrons away from\nthe edge, toward the receiving contact. Our results demonstrate that a cooled\nSPM is a promising tool to investigate the motion of electrons in ballistic\ngraphene devices.\n", "  This letter explains a new, highly sensitive method for the detection of\nneutrons, which uses the T$_{1/2}=845$ ns delay in the decay of $^{128}$I at\nthe 137.8 keV energy level, resulting from the capture of thermal neutrons by\niodine nuclei in NaI and CsI scintillation detectors. The use of delayed\ncoincidence techniques with a several $\\mu {\\rm s}$ time frame for delayed\nevents allows for the highly effective discrimination of neutron events from\nany existing background signals. A comparison of ambient neutron measurements\nbetween those identified through the suggested method from a cylindrical, \\o$\\,\n63 \\, {\\rm mm}\\times 63\\, {\\rm mm}$ NaI(Tl) scintillator and those from a\nlow-background proportional $^3$He counter experimentally demonstrates the\nefficacy of this neutron detection method. For an isotropic, $4\\pi$, thermal\nneutron flux of 1 ${\\rm n}\\, {\\rm cm}^{-2}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$, the absolute\nsensitivity of the NaI detector was found to be $6.5 \\pm 1\\, {\\rm counts}\\,\n{\\rm s}^{-1}$ with a background of $0.8\\, {\\rm events}\\, {\\rm day}^{-1}$ and a\ndelay time frame of $\\Delta {\\rm t}=1\\, \\mu $s. The proposed method can provide\nlow-background experiments, using NaI or CsI, with measurements of the rate and\nstability of incoming neutron flux to a greater accuracy than 10$^{-8}\\, {\\rm\nn}\\, {\\rm cm}^{-2}\\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$.\n", "  We present a technique for handling Dirichlet boundary conditions with the\nFlux Coordinate Independent (FCI) parallel derivative operator with\narbitrary-shaped material geometry in general 3D magnetic fields. The FCI\nmethod constructs a finite difference scheme for $\\nabla_\\Vert$ by following\nfield lines between planes and interpolating within planes. Doing so removes\nthe need for field-aligned coordinate systems that suffer from singularities in\nthe metric tensor at null points in the magnetic field (or equivalently, when\n$q \\to \\infty$). One cost of this method is that as the field lines are not on\nthe mesh, they may leave the domain at any point between neighbouring planes,\ncomplicating the application of boundary conditions.\n  The Leg Value Fill (LVF) boundary condition scheme presented here involves an\nextrapolation/interpolation of the boundary value onto the field line end\npoint. The usual finite difference scheme can then be used unmodified. We\nimplement the LVF scheme in BOUT++ and use the Method of Manufactured Solutions\nto verify the implementation in a rectangular domain, and show that the error\nscaling of the finite difference scheme isn't modified. The use of LVF for\narbitrary wall geometry is outlined.\n  We also demonstrate the feasibility of using the FCI approach in\nnon-axisymmetric configurations for a simple diffusion model in a \"straight\nstellarator\" magnetic field. A Gaussian blob diffuses along the field lines,\ntracing out flux surfaces. Dirichlet boundary conditions impose a last closed\nflux surface (LCFS) that confines the density. Including a poloidal limiter\nmoves the LCFS to a smaller radius.\n  The expected scaling of the numerical perpendicular diffusion, which is a\nconsequence of the FCI method, in stellarator-like geometry is recovered. A\nnovel technique for increasing the parallel resolution during post-processing\nis also described.\n", "  Kondo insulating materials lie outside the usual dichotomy of weakly versus\ncorrelated - band versus Mott - insulators. They are metallic at high\ntemperatures but resemble band insulators at low temperatures because of the\nopening of an interaction induced band gap. The first discovered Kondo\ninsulator (KI) SmB$_6$ has been predicted to form a topological KI (TKI) which\nmimics a topological insulator at low temperatures. However, since its\ndiscovery thermodynamic and transport anomalies have been observed that have\ndefied a theoretical explanation. Enigmatic signatures of collective modes\ninside the charge gap are seen in specific heat, thermal transport and quantum\noscillation experiments in strong magnetic fields. Here, we show that TKIs are\nsusceptible to the formation of excitons and magneto-excitons. These charge\nneutral composite particles can account for long-standing anomalies in SmB$_6$\nwhich is crucial for the identification of bulk topological signatures.\n", "  As a model for the semiclassical analysis of quantum-mechanical systems with\nboth potentials and boundary conditions, we construct the WKB propagator for a\nlinear potential sloping away from an impenetrable boundary. First, we find all\nclassical paths from point $y$ to point $x$ in time $t$ and calculate the\ncorresponding action and amplitude functions. A large part of space-time turns\nout to be classically inaccessible, and the boundary of this region is a\ncaustic of an unusual type, where the amplitude vanishes instead of diverging.\nWe show that this curve is the limit of caustics in the usual sense when the\nreflecting boundary is approximated by steeply rising smooth potentials. Then,\nto improve the WKB approximation we construct the propagator for initial data\nin momentum space; this requires classifying the interesting variety of\nclassical paths with initial momentum $p$ arriving at $x$ after time $t$. The\ntwo approximate propagators are compared by applying them to Gaussian initial\npackets by numerical integration; the results show physically expected\nbehavior, with advantages to the momentum-based propagator in the classically\nforbidden regime (large $t$).\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigate mechanical nanooscillators\ncoupled to the light in an optical ring resonator made of dielectric mirrors.\nWe identify an optomechanical damping mechanism that is fundamentally different\nto the well known cooling in standing wave cavities. While, in a standing wave\ncavity the mechanical oscillation shifts the resonance frequency of the cavity\nin a ring resonator the frequency does not change. Instead the position of the\nnodes is shifted with the mechanical excursion. We derive the damping rates and\ntest the results experimentally with a silicon-nitride nanomembrane. It turns\nout that scattering from small imperfections of the dielectric mirror coatings\nhas to be taken into account to explain the value of the measured damping rate.\nWe extend our theoretical model and regard a second reflector in the cavity\nthat captures the effects of mirror back scattering. This model can be used to\nalso describe the situation of two membranes that both interact with the cavity\nfields. This may be interesting for future work on synchronization of distant\noscillators that are coupled by intracavity light fields.\n", "  We analyze charmless two-body non-leptonic B decays $B \\to PP, PV$ under the\nframework of factorization assisted topological amplitude approach, where\n$P(V)$ denotes a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson. Compared with the\nconventional flavor diagram approach, we consider flavor $SU(3)$ breaking\neffect assisted by factorization hypothesis for topological diagram amplitudes\nof different decay modes, factorizing out the corresponding decay constants and\nform factors. The non-perturbative parameters of topology diagram magnitudes\n$\\chi$ and strong phase $\\phi$ are universal that can be extracted by $\\chi^2$\nfit from current abundant experimental data of charmless B decays. The number\nof free parameters and the $\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom are both reduced\ncomparing with previous analysis. With these best fitted parameters, we predict\nbranching fractions and $CP$ asymmetry parameters of nearly 100 $B_{u,d}$ and\n$B_s$ decay modes. The long-standing $\\pi \\pi$ and $\\pi K$-$CP$ puzzles are\nresolved simultaneoulsy.\n", "  Doppler broadening plays an important role in laser rovibrational\nspectroscopy of trapped deuterated molecular hydrogen ions (HD$^+$), even at\nthe millikelvin temperatures achieved through sympathetic cooling by\nlaser-cooled beryllium ions. Recently, Biesheuvel \\textit{et al.}\n\\cite{Biesheuvel2016} presented a theoretical lineshape model for such\ntransitions which not only considers linestrengths and Doppler broadening, but\nalso the finite sample size and population redistribution by blackbody\nradiation, which are important in view of the long storage and probe times\nachievable in ion traps. Here, we employ the rate equation model developed by\nBiesheuvel \\textit{et al.} to theoretically study the Doppler-broadened\nhyperfine structure of the $(v,L):(0,3)\\rightarrow(4,2)$ rovibrational\ntransition in HD$^+$ at 1442~nm. We observe prominent yet hitherto unrecognized\nghost features in the simulated spectrum, whose positions depend on the Doppler\nwidth, transition rates, and saturation levels of the hyperfine components\naddressed by the laser. We explain the origin and behavior of such features,\nand we provide a simple quantitative guideline to assess whether ghost features\nmay appear. As such ghost features may be common to saturated Doppler-broadened\nspectra of rotational and vibrational transitions in trapped ions composed of\npartly overlapping lines, our work illustrates the necessity to use lineshape\nmodels that take into account all the relevant physics.\n", "  In this article we provide a method to generate the trade-off between\ndelivery time and fluence map matching quality for volumetric modulated arc\ntherapy (VMAT). At the heart of our method lies a mathematical programming\nmodel that, for a given duration of delivery, optimizes leaf trajectories and\ndose rates such that the desired fluence map is reproduced as well as possible.\nThis model was presented for the single map case in a companion paper (Fast\napproximate delivery of fluence maps: the single map case). The resulting\nlarge-scale, non-convex optimization problem was solved using a heuristic\napproach. The single-map approach cannot directly be applied to the full arc\ncase due to the large increase in model size, the issue of allocating delivery\ntimes to each of the arc segments, and the fact that the ending leaf positions\nfor one map will be the starting leaf positions for the next map. In this\narticle the method proposed in \\cite{dm1} is extended to solve the full map\ntreatment planning problem. We test our method using a prostate case and a head\nand neck case, and present the resulting trade-off curves. Analysis of the leaf\ntrajectories reveal that short time plans have larger leaf openings in general\nthan longer delivery time plans. Our method allows one to explore the continuum\nof possibilities between coarse, large segment plans characteristic of direct\naperture approaches and narrow field plans produced by sliding window\napproaches. Exposing this trade off will allow for an informed choice between\nplan quality and solution time. Further research is required to speed up the\noptimization process to make this method clinically implementable.\n", "  ADC non-linearities are a major systematic effect in the search for keV-scale\nsterile neutrinos with tritium $\\beta$-decay experiments like KATRIN. They can\nsignificantly distort the spectral shape and thereby obscure the tiny kink-like\nsignature of a sterile neutrino. In this work we demonstrate various mitigation\ntechniques to reduce the impact of ADC non-linearities on the tritium\n$\\beta$-decay spectrum to a level of $<$ ppm. The best results are achieved\nwith a multi-pixel ($\\geq10^4$ pixels) detector using full waveform\ndigitization. In this case, active-to-sterile mixing angles of the order of\n$\\sin^2 \\theta = 10^{-7}$ would be accessible from the viewpoint of ADC\nnon-linearities. With purely peak-sensing ADCs a comparable sensitivity could\nbe reached with highly linear ADCs, sufficient non-linearity corrections or by\nincreasing the number of pixels to $\\geq 10^5$.\n", "  In this paper, we consider an open-loop, finite-time, optimal control problem\nof attaining a specific desired current profile during the ramp-up phase by\nfinding the best open-loop actuator input trajectories. Average density, total\npower, and plasma current are used as control actuators to manipulate the\nprofile shape in tokamak plasmas. Based on the control parameterization method,\nwe propose a numerical solution procedure directly to solve the original\nPDE-constrained optimization problem using gradient-based optimization\ntechniques such as sequential quadratic programming (SQP). This paper is aimed\nat proposing an effective framework for the solution of PDE-constrained\noptimization problem in tokamak plasmas. A more user-friendly and efficient\ngraphical user interface (GUI) is designed in MATLAB and the numerical\nsimulation results are verified to demonstrate its applicability. In addition,\nthe proposed framework of combining existing PDE and numerical optimization\nsolvers to solve PDE-constrained optimization problem has the prospective to\ntarget challenge advanced control problems arising in more general chemical\nengineering processes.\n", "  During early development, the establishment of gradients of transcriptional\nfactors determines the patterning of cell fates. The case of Bicoid (Bcd) in\n{\\it Drosophila melanogaster} embryos is well documented and studied. There are\nstill controversies as to whether {\\it SDD} models in which Bcd is {\\it\nSynthesized} at one end, then {\\it Diffuses} and is {\\it Degraded} can explain\nthe gradient formation within the timescale observed experimentally. The Bcd\ngradient is observed in embryos that express a Bicoid-eGFP fusion protein\n(Bcd-GFP) which cannot differentiate if Bcd is freely diffusing or bound to\nimmobile sites. In this work we analyze an {\\it SDID} model that includes the\n{\\it Interaction} of Bcd with binding sites. Using previously determined\nbiophysical parameters we find that this model can explain the gradient\nformation within the experimentally observed time. Analyzing the differences\nbetween the free and bound Bcd distributions we observe that the latter spans\nover a longer lengthscale. We conclude that deriving the lengthscale from the\ndistribution of Bcd-GFP can lead to an overestimation of the gradient\nlengthscale and of the degree of cooperativity that explains the distribution\nof the protein Hunchback whose production is regulated by Bcd.\n", "  We analyze the connection between $p_T$ and multiplicity distributions in a\nstatistical framework. We connect the Tsallis parameters, $T$ and $q$, to\nphysical properties like average energy per particle and the second scaled\nfactorial moment, $F_2=\\langle n(n-1) \\rangle / {\\langle n \\rangle}^2$,\nmeasured in multiplicity distributions. Near and far from equilibrium scenarios\nwith master equations for the probability of having $n$ particles, $P_n$, are\nreviewed based on hadronization transition rates, $\\mu_n$, from $n$ to $n+1$\nparticles.\n", "  The N\\'eel temperature, staggered magnetization density, as well as the\nspinwave velocity of a three-dimensional (3D) quantum Heisenberg model with\nantiferromagnetic disorder (randomness) are calculated using first principles\nnon-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, we examine the\nvalidity of universal scaling relations that are related to these three studied\nphysical quantities. These relations are relevant to experimental data and are\nfirmly established for clean (regular) 3D dimerized spin-1/2 Heisenberg models.\nRemarkably, our numerical results show that the considered scaling relations\nremain true for the investigated model with the introduced disorder. In\naddition, while the presence of disorder may change the physical properties of\nregular dimerized models, hence leading to different critical theories, both\nthe obtained data of N\\'eel temperature and staggered magnetization density in\nour study are fully compatible with the expected critical behaviour for clean\ndimerized systems. As a result, it is persuasive to conclude that the related\nquantum phase transitions of the considered disordered model and its clean\ncounterparts are governed by the same critical theory, which is not always the\ncase in general. Finally, we also find smooth scalings even emerging when both\nthe data of the investigated disordered model as well as its associated clean\nsystem are taken into account. This in turn implies that, while in a restricted\nsense, the considered scaling relations for 3D spin-1/2 antiferromagnets are\nindeed universal.\n", "  Engineered spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in cold atom systems can aid in the\nstudy of novel synthetic materials and complex condensed matter phenomena.\nDespite great advances, alkali atom SOC systems are hindered by heating from\nspontaneous emission, which limits the observation of many-body effects,\nmotivating research into potential alternatives. Here we demonstrate that SOC\ncan be engineered to occur naturally in a one-dimensional fermionic 87Sr\noptical lattice clock (OLC). In contrast to previous SOC experiments, in this\nwork the SOC is both generated and probed using a direct ultra-narrow optical\nclock transition between two electronic orbital states. We use clock\nspectroscopy to prepare lattice band populations, internal electronic states,\nand quasimomenta, as well as to produce SOC dynamics. The exceptionally long\nlifetime of the excited clock state (160 s) eliminates decoherence and atom\nloss from spontaneous emission at all relevant experimental timescales,\nallowing subsequent momentum- and spin-resolved in situ probing of the SOC band\nstructure and eigenstates. We utilize these capabilities to study Bloch\noscillations, spin-momentum locking, and Van Hove singularities in the\ntransition density of states. Our results lay the groundwork for the use of\nOLCs to probe novel SOC phases of matter.\n", "  Hector will be the new massively-multiplexed integral field spectroscopy\n(IFS) instrument for the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) in Australia and the\nnext main dark-time instrument for the observatory. Based on the success of the\nSAMI instrument, which is undertaking a 3400-galaxy survey, the integral field\nunit (IFU) imaging fibre bundle (hexabundle) technology under-pinning SAMI is\nbeing improved to a new innovative design for Hector. The distribution of\nhexabundle angular sizes is matched to the galaxy survey properties in order to\nimage 90% of galaxies out to 2 effective radii. 50-100 of these IFU imaging\nbundles will be positioned by 'starbug' robots across a new 3-degree field\ncorrector top end to be purpose-built for the AAT. Many thousand fibres will\nthen be fed into new replicable spectrographs. Fundamentally new science will\nbe achieved compared to existing instruments due to Hector's wider field of\nview (3 degrees), high positioning efficiency using starbugs, higher\nspectroscopic resolution (R~3000-5500 from 3727-7761A, with a possible redder\nextension later) and large IFUs (up to 30 arcsec diameter with 61-217 fibre\ncores). A 100,000 galaxy IFS survey with Hector will decrypt how the accretion\nand merger history and large-scale environment made every galaxy different in\nits morphology and star formation history. The high resolution, particularly in\nthe blue, will make Hector the only instrument to be able to measure\nhigher-order kinematics for galaxies down to much lower velocity dispersion\nthan in current large IFS galaxy surveys, opening up a wealth of new nearby\ngalaxy science.\n", "  We present charm (cosmic history agnostic reconstruction method), a novel\ninference algorithm that reconstructs the cosmic expansion history as encoded\nin the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ from SNe Ia data. The novelty of the approach\nlies in the usage of information field theory, a statistical field theory that\nis very well suited for the construction of optimal signal recovery algorithms.\nThe charm algorithm infers non-parametrically\n$s(a)=\\ln(\\rho(a)/\\rho_{\\mathrm{crit}0})$, the density evolution which\ndetermines $H(z)$, without assuming an analytical form of $\\rho(a)$ but only\nits smoothness with the scale factor $a=(1+z)^{-1}$. The inference problem of\nrecovering the signal $s(a)$ from the data is formulated in a fully Bayesian\nway. In detail, we have rewritten the signal as the sum of a background\ncosmology and a perturbation. This allows us to determine the maximum a\nposteriory estimate of the signal by an iterative Wiener filter method.\nApplying charm to the Union2.1 supernova compilation, we have recovered a\ncosmic expansion history that is fully compatible with the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological expansion history with parameter values consistent\nwith the results of the Planck mission.\n", "  Curado \\textit{et al.} [Ann. Phys. \\textbf{366} (2016) 22] have recently\nstudied the axiomatic structure and the universality of a three-parameter\ntrace-form entropy inspired by the group-theoretical structure. In this work,\nwe study the group-theoretical entropy $S_{a,b,r}$ in the context of the third\nlaw of thermodynamics where the parameters $\\left\\lbrace a,b,r \\right\\rbrace $\nare all independent. We show that this three-parameter entropy expression can\nsimultaneously satisfy the third law of thermodynamics and the three Khinchin\naxioms, namely continuity, concavity and expansibility only when the parameter\n$b$ is set to zero. In other words, it is thermodynamically valid only as a\ntwo-parameter generalization $S_{a,r}$. Moreover, the restriction set by the\nthird law i.e., the condition $b = 0$, is important in the sense that the so\nobtained two-parameter group-theoretical entropy becomes extensive only when\nthis condition is met. We also illustrate the interval of validity of the third\nlaw using the one-dimensional Ising model with no external field. Finally, we\nshow that the $S_{a,r}$ is in the same universality class as that of the\nKaniadakis entropy for $0 < r < 1$ while it has a distinct universality class\nin the interval $-1 < r < 0$.\n", "  We consider rotating convection in a shallow, cylindrical domain. We examine\nthe conditions under which the resulting vortex develops an eye at its core;\nthat is, a region where the poloidal flow reverses and the angular momentum is\nlow. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to steady, axisymmetric flows in a\nBoussinesq fluid. Our numerical experiments show that, in such systems, an eye\nforms as a passive response to the development of a so-called eyewall, a\nconical annulus of intense, negative azimuthal vorticity that can form near the\naxis and separates the eye from the primary vortex. We also observe that the\nvorticity in the eyewall comes from the lower boundary layer, and relies on the\nfact the poloidal flow strips negative vorticity out of the boundary layer and\ncarries it up into the fluid above as it turns upward near the axis. This\nprocess is effective only if the Reynolds number is sufficiently high for the\nadvection of vorticity to dominate over diffusion. Finally we observe that, in\nthe vicinity of the eye and the eyewall, the buoyancy and Coriolis forces are\nnegligible, and so although these forces are crucial to driving and shaping the\nprimary vortex, they play no direct role in eye formation in a Boussinesq\nfluid.\n", "  The formalism of next-to-leading order Fermi Liquid Theory is employed to\ncalculate the thermal properties of symmetric nuclear and pure neutron matter\nin a relativistic many-body theory beyond the mean field level which includes\ntwo-loop effects. For all thermal variables, the semi-analytical\nnext-to-leading order corrections reproduce results of the exact numerical\ncalculations for entropies per baryon up to 2. This corresponds to excellent\nagreement down to sub-nuclear densities for temperatures up to $20$ MeV. In\naddition to providing physical insights, a rapid evaluation of the equation of\nstate in the homogeneous phase of hot and dense matter is achieved through the\nuse of the zero-temperature Landau effective mass function and its derivatives.\n", "  The structure of tree-level scattering amplitudes for collinear massless\nbosons is studied beyond their leading splitting function behavior. These\nnear-collinear limits at sub-leading order are best studied using the\nCachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulation of the S-matrix based on the scattering\nequations. We compute the collinear limits for gluons, gravitons and scalars.\nIt is shown that the CHY integrand for an n-particle gluon scattering amplitude\nin the collinear limit at sub-leading order is expressed as a convolution of an\n(n-1)-particle gluon integrand and a collinear kernel integrand, which is\nuniversal. Our representation is shown to obey recently proposed amplitude\nrelations in which the collinear gluons of same helicity are replaced by a\nsingle graviton. Finally, we extend our analysis to effective field theories\nand study the collinear limit of the non-linear sigma model,\nEinstein-Maxwell-Scalar and Yang-Mills-Scalar theory.\n", "  Minimal spanning trees (MSTs) have been used in cosmology and astronomy to\ndistinguish distributions of points in a multi-dimensional space. They are\nessentially unknown in particle physics, however. We briefly define MSTs and\nillustrate their properties through a series of examples. We show how they\nmight be applied to study a typical event sample from a collider experiment and\nconclude that MSTs may prove useful in distinguishing different classes of\nevents.\n", "  The mass and meson-current coupling constant of the resonance $X(5568)$, as\nwell as the width of the decay $X(5568)\\to B_s^{\\ast}\\pi$ are calculated by\nmodeling the exotic $X(5568)$ resonance as a diquark-antidiquark state $%\nX_b=[su][bd]$ with quantum numbers $J^{P}=1^{+}$. The calculations are made\nemploying QCD two-point sum rule method, where the quark, gluon and mixed\nvacuum condensates up to dimension eight are taken into account. The sum rule\napproach on the light-cone in its soft-meson approximation is used to explore\nthe vertex $X_bB_{s}^{\\ast}\\pi$ and extract the strong coupling $%\ng_{X_bB_{s}^{\\ast}\\pi}$, which is a necessary ingredient to find the width of\nthe $X_b \\to B_s^{\\ast}\\pi^{+}$ decay process. The obtained predictions are\ncompared with the experimental data of the D0 Collaboration, and results of\nother theoretical works.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of explaining the enhancement in semileptonic\ndecays of $\\bar B \\to D^{(*)} \\tau \\bar \\nu$, the anomalies induced by $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ in $\\bar B\\to (K, K^*, \\phi)\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and violation of lepton\nuniversality in $R_K = Br(\\bar B\\to K \\mu^+\\mu^-)/Br(\\bar B\\to K e^+e^-)$\nwithin the framework of R-parity violating (RPV) MSSM. Exchange of down type\nright-handed squark coupled to quarks and leptons yield interactions which are\nsimilar to leptoquark induced interactions that have been proposed to explain\nthe $\\bar B \\to D^{(*)} \\tau \\bar \\nu$ by tree level interactions and $b\\to s\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomalies by loop induced interactions, simultaneously. However,\nthe Yukawa couplings in such theories have severe constraints from other rare\nprocesses in $B$ and $D$ decays. Although this interaction can provide a viable\nsolution to $R(D^{(*)})$ anomaly, we show that with the severe constraint from\n$\\bar B \\to K \\nu \\bar \\nu$, it is impossible to solve the anomalies in $b\\to s\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ process simultaneously.\n", "  A floating air bag, ballasted in water, expands and contracts as it heaves\nunder wave action. Connecting the bag to a secondary volume via a turbine\ntransforms the bag into a device capable of generating useful energy from the\nwaves. Small-scale measurements of the device reveal some interesting\nproperties, which are successfully predicted numerically. Owing to its\ncompressibility, the device can have a heave resonance period longer than that\nof a rigid device of the same shape and size, without any phase control.\nFurthermore, varying the amount of air in the bag is found to change its shape\nand hence its dynamic response, while varying the turbine damping or the air\nvolume ratio changes the dynamic response without changing the shape.\n", "  We report Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements on stage-I potassium\nintercalated graphite (KC$_8$). Angular dependent measurements show that the\nspin-lattice relaxation time is longer when the magnetic field is perpendicular\nto the graphene layer as compared to when the magnetic field is in the plane.\nThis anisotropy is analyzed in the framework of the Elliott-Yafet theory of\nspin-relaxation in metals. The analysis considers an anisotropic spin-orbit\nHamiltonian and the first order perturbative treatment of Elliott is reproduced\nfor this model Hamiltonian. The result provides an experimental input for the\nfirst-principles theories of spin-orbit interaction in layered carbon and thus\nto a better understanding of spin-relaxation phenomena in graphene and in other\nlayered materials as well.\n", "  The putative black holes which may constitute all the dark matter are\ndescribed by a Kerr metric with only two parameters, mass M and angular\nmomentum J. There has been little discussion of J since it plays no role in the\nupcoming attempt at detection by microlensing. Nevertheless J does play a\ncentral role in understanding the previous lack of detection, especially of CMB\ndistortion. We explain why bounds previously derived from lack of CMB\ndistortion are too strong for primordial black holes with J non-vanishing.\nAlmost none of the dark matter black holes can be from stellar collapse, and\nnearly all are primordial, to avoid excessive CMB distortion.\n", "  In a previous work, we have shown that, like BPS Dp branes, bulk gravity gets\ndecoupled from the brane even for the non-susy Dp branes of type II string\ntheories indicating a possible extension of AdS/CFT correspondence for the\nnon-supersymmetric case. In that work, the decoupling of gravity on the\nnon-susy Dp branes has been shown numerically for the general case as well as\nanalytically for some special case. Here we discuss the decoupling limit and\nthe throat geometry of the non-susy D3 brane when the charge associated with\nthe brane is very large. We show that in the decoupling limit the throat\ngeometry of the non-susy D3 brane, under appropriate coordinate change, reduces\nto the Constable-Myers solution and thus confirming that this solution is\nindeed the holographic dual of a (non-gravitational) gauge theory discussed\nthere. We also show that when one of the parameters of the solution takes a\nspecific value, it reduces, under another coordinate change, to the\nfive-dimensional solution obtained by Csaki and Reece, again confirming its\ngauge theory interpretation.\n", "  A characteristic signature of String Gas Cosmology is primordial power\nspectra for scalar and tensor modes which are almost scale-invariant but with a\nred tilt for scalar modes but a blue tilt for tensor modes. This feature,\nhowever, can also be realized in the so-called G-inflation model, in which\nHorndeski operators are introduced which leads to a blue tensor tilt by softly\nbreaking the Null Energy Condition. In this article we search for potential\nobservational differences between these two cosmologies by performing detailed\nperturbation analyses based on the Effective Field Theory approach. Our results\nshow that, although both two models produce blue tilted tensor perturbations,\nthey behave differently in three aspects. Firstly, String Gas Cosmology\npredicts a specific consistency relation between the index of the scalar modes\nns and that of tensor ones nt, which is hard to be reproduced by G-inflation.\nSecondly, String Gas Cosmology typically predicts non-Gaussianities which are\nhighly suppressed on observable scales, while G-inflation gives rise to\nobservationally large non-Gaussianities because the kinetic terms in the action\nbecome important during inflation. However, after finely tuning the model\nparameters of G-inflation it is possible to obtain a blue tensor spectrum and\nnegligible non-Gaussianities with a degeneracy between the two models. This\ndegeneracy can be broken by a third observable, namely the scale dependence of\nthe nonlinearity parameter, which vanishes for G-inflation but has a blue tilt\nin the case of String Gas Cosmology. Therefore, we conclude that String Gas\nCosmology is in principle observationally distinguishable from the single field\ninflationary cosmology, even allowing for modifications such as G-inflation.\n", "  This paper focuses on the analysis of $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal\ntheories in the presence of a defect from the point of view of the conformal\nbootstrap. We will concentrate first on the case of codimension one, where the\ndefect is a boundary that preserves half of the supersymmetry. After studying\nthe constraints imposed by supersymmetry, we will obtain the Ward identities\nassociated to two-point functions of $\\tfrac{1}{2}$-BPS operators and write\ntheir solution as a superconformal block expansion. Due to a surprising\nconnection between spacetime and R-symmetry conformal blocks, our results not\nonly apply to $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal theories with a boundary, but\nalso to three more systems that have the same symmetry algebra: $4d$\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal theories with a line defect, $3d$\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal theories with no defect, and $OSP(4^*|4)$\nsuperconformal quantum mechanics. The superconformal algebra implies that all\nthese systems possess a closed subsector of operators in which the bootstrap\nequations become polynomial constraints on the CFT data. We derive these\ntruncated equations and initiate the study of their solutions.\n", "  The new mesons $X(3940)$ and $X(4160)$ have been found by Belle Collaboration\nin the processes $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi D^{(*)}\\bar D^{(*)}$. Considering $X(3940)$\nand $X(4160)$ as $\\eta_c(3S)$ and $\\eta_c(4S)$ states, the two-body open charm\nOZI-allowed strong decay of $\\eta_c(3S)$ and $\\eta_c(4S)$ are studied by the\nimproved Bethe-Salpeter method combine with the $^3P_0$ model. The strong decay\nwidth of $\\eta_c(3S)$ is $\\Gamma_{\\eta_c(3S)}=(33.5^{+18.4}_{-15.3})$ MeV,\nwhich is closed to the result of $X(3940)$, therefore, $\\eta_c(3S)$ is a good\ncandidate of $X(3940)$. The strong decay width of $\\eta_c(4S)$ is\n$\\Gamma_{\\eta_c(4S)}=(69.9^{+22.4}_{-21.1})$ MeV, considering the errors of the\nresults, it's closed to the lower limit of $X(4160)$. But the ratio of the\ndecay width $\\frac{\\Gamma(D\\bar D^*)}{\\Gamma (D^*\\bar D^*)}$ of $\\eta_c(4S)$ is\nlarger than the experimental data of $X(4160)$. According to the above\nanalysis, $\\eta_c(4S)$ is not the candidate of $X(4160)$, and more\ninvestigations of $X(4160)$ is needed.\n", "  Nonclassicality of quantum states is expressed in many shades, the most\nstringent of them being a new standard introduced recently in [Phys. Rev. A 89,\n062110 (2014)]. This is accomplished by expanding the notion of local hidden\nvariables (LHV) to generalised local hidden variables (GLHV), which renders\nmany nonlocal states also classical. We investigate these super-quantum states\n(called exceptional in [Phys. Rev. A 89, 062110 (2014)]) in the family of\n$SU(2)$ invariant $3 \\times N$ level systems. We show that all super-quantum\nstates admit a universal geometrical description, and that they are most likely\nto lie on a line segment in the manifold, irrespective of the value of $N$. We\nalso show that though the super - quantum states can be highly mixed, its\nrelative rank with respect to the uniform state is always less than that of a\nstate which admits a GLHV description.\n", "  We study the many body Schr\\\"odinger evolution of weakly coupled fermions\ninteracting through a Coulomb potential. We are interested in a joint mean\nfield and semiclassical scaling, that emerges naturally for initially confined\nparticles. For initial data describing approximate Slater determinants, we\nprove convergence of the many-body evolution towards Hartree-Fock dynamics. Our\nresult holds under a condition on the solution of the Hartree-Fock equation,\nthat we can only show in a very special situation (translation invariant data,\nwhose Hartree-Fock evolution is trivial), but that we expect to hold more\ngenerally.\n", "  The Breakthrough Starshot initiative aims to launch a gram-scale spacecraft\nto a speed of $v\\sim 0.2$c, capable of reaching the nearest star system,\n$\\alpha$ Centauri, in about 20 years. However, a critical challenge for the\ninitiative is the damage to the spacecraft by interstellar gas and dust during\nthe journey. In this paper, we quantify the interaction of a relativistic\nspacecraft with gas and dust in the interstellar medium. For gas bombardment,\nwe find that damage by track formation due to heavy elements is an important\neffect. We find that gas bombardment can potentially damage the surface of the\nspacecraft to a depth of $\\sim 0.1$ mm for quartz material after traversing a\ngas column of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 2\\times 10^{18}\\rm cm^{-2}$ along the path to\n$\\alpha$ Centauri, whereas the effect is much weaker for graphite material. The\neffect of dust bombardment erodes the spacecraft surface and produces numerous\ncraters due to explosive evaporation of surface atoms. For a spacecraft speed\n$v=0.2c$, we find that dust bombardment can erode a surface layer of $\\sim 0.5$\nmm thickness after the spacecraft has swept a column density of $N_{\\rm H}\\sim\n3\\times 10^{17}\\rm cm^{-2}$, assuming the standard gas-to-dust ratio of the\ninterstellar medium. Dust bombardment also damages the spacecraft surface by\nmodifying the material structure through melting. We calculate the equilibrium\nsurface temperature due to collisional heating by gas atoms as well as the\ntemperature profile as a function of depth into the spacecraft. Our\nquantitative results suggest methods for damage control, and we highlight\npossibilities for shielding strategies and protection of the spacecraft.\n", "  We study the depolarization dynamics of a dense ensemble of dipolar\ninteracting spins, associated with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. We\nobserve anomalously fast, density-dependent, and non-exponential spin\nrelaxation. To explain these observations, we propose a microscopic model where\nan interplay of long-range interactions, disorder, and dissipation leads to\npredictions that are in quantitative agreement with both current and prior\nexperimental results. Our results pave the way for controlled many-body\nexperiments with long-lived and strongly interacting ensembles of solid-state\nspins.\n", "  We explore the detection possibility of light pseudoscalar Higgs boson in the\nnext-to-minimal supersymmetric Standard Model(NMSSM) at the LHC with the center\nof mass energy, $\\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV. We focus on the parameter space which\nprovides one of the Higgs boson as the SM-like with a mass of 125 GeV and some\nof the non-SM-like Higgs bosons can be light having suppressed couplings with\nfermions and gauge bosons due to their singlet nature. It is observed that for\ncertain region of model parameter space, the singlet like light pseudoscalar\ncan decay to di-photon($\\gamma\\gamma$) channel with a substantial branching\nratio. In this study, we consider this di-photon signal of light pseudoscalar\nHiggs boson producing it through the chargino-neutralino production and the\nsubsequent decay of neutralino. We consider signal consisting of two photons\nplus missing energy along with a lepton from the chargino decay. Performing a\ndetailed simulation of the signal and backgrounds including detector effects,\nwe present results for a few benchmark points corresponding to the pseudoscalar\nHiggs boson mass in the range 60 -100 GeV. Our studies indicate that some of\nthe benchmark points in the parameter space can be probed with a reasonable\nsignificance for 100 fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. We also conclude that\nexploiting this channel it is possible to distinguish the NMSSM from the other\nsupersymmetric models.\n", "  Light absorption in conducting materials produces heating of their conduction\nelectrons, followed by relaxation into phonons within picoseconds, and\nsubsequent diffusion into the surrounding media over longer timescales. This\nconventional picture of optical heating is supplemented by radiative cooling,\nwhich typically takes place at an even lower pace, only becoming relevant for\nstructures held in vacuum or under extreme conditions of thermal isolation.\nHere we reveal an ultrafast radiative cooling regime between neighboring\nplasmon-supporting graphene nanostructures in which noncontact heat transfer\nbecomes a dominant channel. We predict that >50% of the electronic heat energy\ndeposited on a graphene disk can be transferred to a neighboring nanoisland\nwithin a femtosecond timescale. This phenomenon is facilitated by the\ncombination of low electronic heat capacity and large plasmonic field\nconcentration displayed by doped graphene. Similar effects should take place in\nother van der Waals materials, thus opening an unexplored avenue toward\nefficient heat management in ultrathin nanostructures.\n", "  In the field of freezing colloidal suspensions, it is important to understand\nthe particle-scale behavior of particle packing. Here, we reveal the dynamics\nof particle packing by identifying the behavior of each single particle in\nsitu. The typical pattern consists of locally ordered clusters and amorphous\ndefects. The microscopic mechanism of pattern formation is ascribed to the\nnon-equilibrium particle-packing process on the particle scale, described with\nthe P\\'eclet number. The macroscopic migration of a particle layer is also\nrevealed by an analytical model involving parameters of freezing speed and\ninitial volume fraction of particles.\n", "  We demonstrate that the elasticity of jammed solids is nonlocal. By forcing\nfrictionless soft sphere packings at varying wavelength, we directly access\ntheir transverse and longitudinal compliances without resorting to curve\nfitting. The observed wavelength dependence of the compliances is incompatible\nwith classical (local) elasticity, and hence quantifies the amplitude of\nnonlocal effects. Three distinct length scales, two of which diverge, control\nthe amplitude of both nonlocal effects and fluctuations about the mean\nresponse. Our results identify new, more accurate constitutive relations for\nweakly jammed solids, including emulsions, foams, and granulates.\n", "  We demonstrate an equivalence between the wave equation obeyed by the\nentanglement entropy of CFT subregions and the linearized bulk Einstein\nequation in Anti-de Sitter pace. In doing so, we make use of the formalism of\nkinematic space [arXiv:1505.05515] and fields on this space, introduced in\n[arXiv:1604.03110]. We show that the gravitational dynamics are equivalent to a\ngauge invariant wave-equation on kinematic space and that this equation arises\nin natural correspondence to the conformal Casimir equation in the CFT.\n", "  We construct an index for BPS operators supported on a ray in five\ndimensional superconformal field theories with exceptional global symmetries.\nWe compute the $E_n$ representations (for $n=2,\\dots,7$) of operators of low\nspin, thus verifying that while the expression for the index is only\nSO$(2n-2)\\times$U(1) invariant, the index itself exhibits the full $E_n$\nsymmetry (at least up to the order we expanded). The ray operators we studied\nin 5d can be viewed as generalizations of operators constructed in a Yang-Mills\ntheory with fundamental matter by attaching an open Wilson line to a quark. For\n$n\\le 7$, in contrast to local operators, they carry nontrivial charge under\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_{9-n}\\subset E_n$ center of the global symmetry. The\nrepresentations that appear in the ray operator index are therefore different,\nfor $n\\le 7$, from those appearing in the previously computed superconformal\nindex. For $3\\le n\\le 7$, we find that the leading term in the index is a\ncharacter of a minuscule representation of $E_n$. We also discuss the case\n$n=8$, which presents a unique technical challenge, and remains an open\nproblem.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are a newly discovered class of materials that host\nrelativistic massless Weyl fermions as their low-energy bulk excitations. Among\nthis new class of materials, there exist two general types of semimetals that\nare of particular interest: type-I Weyl semimetals, that have broken inversion\nor time-reversal symmetry symmetry, and type-II Weyl semimetals, that\nadditionally breaks Lorentz invariance. In this work, we use Born approximation\nto analytically demonstrate that the type-I Weyl semimetals may undergo a\nquantum phase transition to type-II Weyl semimetals in the presence of the\nfinite charge and magnetic disorder when non-zero tilt exist. The phase\ntransition occurs when the disorder renormalizes the topological mass, thereby\nreducing the Fermi velocity near the Weyl cone below the tilt of the cone. We\nalso confirm the presence of the disorder induced phase transition in Weyl\nsemimetals using exact diagonalization of a three-dimensional tight-binding\nmodel to calculate the resultant phase diagram of the type-I Weyl semimetal.\n", "  The properties of the high energy behavior of the scattering amplitude of\nmassive, neutral and spinless particles in higher dimensional field theories\nare investigated. The axiomatic formulation of Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann\nis adopted. The analyticity properties of the causal, the retarded and the\nadvanced functions associated with the four point elastic amplitudes are\nstudied. The analog of the Lehmann-Jost-Dyson representation is obtained in\nhigher dimensional field theories. The generalized J-L-D representation is\nutilized to derive the t-plane analyticity property of the amplitude. The\nexistence of an ellipse analogous to the Lehmann ellipse is demonstrated. Thus\na fixed-t dispersion relation can be written down with finite number of\nsubtractions due to the temperedness of the amplitudes. The domain of\nanalyticity of scattering amplitude in $s$ and $t$ variables is extended by\nimposing unitarity constraints. A generalized version of Martin's theorem is\nderived to prove the existence of such a domain in D-dimensional field\ntheories. It is shown that the amplitude can be expanded in a power series in t\nwhich converges for |t|<R; R being s-independent. The positivity properties of\nabsorptive amplitudes are derived to prove the $t$-plane analyticity of\namplitude. In the extended analyticity domain dispersion relations are written\nwith two subtractions. The bound on the total cross section is derived from LSZ\naxioms without any extra ad hoc assumptions.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for\nthe empirical measure of mean-field interacting diffusions in a random\nenvironment. The point is to derive such a result once the environment has been\nfrozen (quenched model). The main theorem states that a LDP holds for every\nrealization of the environment, with a rate function that does not depend on\nthe disorder and is different from the rate function in the averaged model.\nSimilar results concerning the empirical flow and local empirical measures are\nprovided.\n", "  We show that if the gravitational Chern-Simons term couples to a massive\nscalar field ($m>H$), the primordial gravitational waves (GWs) will show itself\nthe chirality oscillation, i.e., the amplitudes of the left- and right-handed\nGWs modes will convert into each other and oscillate in their propagations.\nThis oscillation will eventually develop a permanent difference of the\namplitudes of both modes, which leads to nearly opposite oscillating shapes in\nthe power spectra of the left- and right-handed primordial GWs. We discuss its\nimplication to the CMB B-mode polarization.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of holographic correlation functions in IIB\nsupergravity on $AdS_5\\times S^5$. Results for four-point functions simplify\ndrastically when expressed in Mellin space. We conjecture a compact formula for\nthe four-point functions of one-half BPS single-trace operators of arbitrary\nweight. Our methods rely on general consistency conditions and eschew detailed\nknowledge of the supergravity effective action.\n", "  We analyze uncertainty relations on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces\nexpressed in terms of classical fidelity, which are stronger then metric\nuncertainty relations introduced by Fawzi, Hayden and Sen. We establish\nvalidity of fidelity uncertainty relations for random unitary matrices with\noptimal parameters (up to universal constants) which improves upon known\nresults for the weaker notion of metric uncertainty. This result is then\napplied to locking classical information in quantum states and allows to obtain\noptimal locking in Hellinger distance, improving upon previous results on\nlocking in the total variation distance, both by strengthening the metric used\nand by improving the dependence on parameters. We also show that general\nprobabilistic estimates behind the main theorem can be used to prove existence\nof data hiding schemes with Bayesian type guarantees. As a byproduct of our\napproach we obtain existence of almost Euclidean subspaces of the matrix spaces\n$\\ell_1^n(\\ell_2^m)$ with a better dimension/distortion dependence than allowed\nin previously known constructions.\n", "  The detailed nature of electronic states mediating ferromagnetic coupling in\ndilute magnetic semiconductors, specifically (Ga,Mn)As, has been an issue of\nlong debate. Two confronting models have been discussed emphasizing host band\nvs. impurity band carriers. Using angle resolved photoemission we are for the\nfirst time able to identify a highly dispersive Mn-induced energy band in\n(Ga,Mn)As. Our results show that the electronic structure of the (Ga,Mn)As\nsystem is significantly modified from that of GaAs throughout the valence band.\nClose to the Fermi energy, the presence of Mn induces a strong mixing of the\nbulk bands of GaAs, which results in the appearance of a highly dispersive band\nin the gap region of GaAs. For Mn concentrations above 1% the band reaches the\nFermi level, and can thus host the delocalized holes needed for ferromagnetic\ncoupling. Overall, our data provide a firm evidence of delocalized carriers\nbelonging to the modified host valence band.\n", "  We present optical and near-IR linear polarimetry of V404 Cyg during its 2015\noutburst and in quiescence. We obtained time resolved r'-band polarimetry when\nthe source was in outburst, near-IR polarimetry when the source was near\nquiescence and multiple wave-band optical polarimetry later in quiescence. The\noptical to near-IR linear polarization spectrum can be described by\ninterstellar dust and an intrinsic variable component. The intrinsic optical\npolarization, detected during the rise of one of the brightest flares of the\noutburst, is variable, peaking at 4.5 per cent and decaying to 3.5 per cent. We\npresent several arguments that favour a synchrotron jet origin to this variable\npolarization, with the optical emission originating close to the jet base. The\npolarization flare occurs during the initial rise of a major radio flare event\nthat peaks later, and is consistent with a classically evolving synchrotron\nflare from an ejection event. We conclude that the optical polarization flare\nrepresents a jet launching event; the birth of a major ejection. For this event\nwe measure a rather stable polarization position angle of -9 degrees E of N,\nimplying that the magnetic field near the base of the jet is approximately\nperpendicular to the jet axis. This may be due to the compression of magnetic\nfield lines in shocks in the accelerated plasma, resulting in a partially\nordered transverse field that have now been seen during the 2015 outburst. We\nalso find that this ejection occurred at a similar stage in the repetitive\ncycles of flares.\n", "  We report on a variety of standard techniques used by New Horizons including\na solar ultraviolet occultation, ultraviolet airglow observations, and\nhigh-phase look-back particulate search imaging to search for an atmosphere\naround Pluto's large moon Charon during its flyby in July 2015. Analyzing these\ndatasets, no evidence for a present day atmosphere has been found for 14\npotential atomic and molecular species, all of which are now constrained to\nhave pressures below 0.3 nanobar, as we describe below, these are much more\nstringent upper limits than the previously available 15-110 nanobar constraints\n(e.g., Sicardy et al. 2006); for example, we find a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit for\nan N$_2$ atmosphere on Charon is 4.2 picobars and a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit for\nthe brightness of any atmospheric haze on Charon of I/F=2.6x10$^{-5}$. A radio\noccultation search for an atmosphere around Charon was also conducted by New\nHorizons but will be published separately by other authors.\n", "  Svensson [Found. Phys. 45, 1645 (2015)] argued that the concept of the weak\nvalue of an observable of a pre- and post-selected quantum system cannot be\napplied when the expectation value of the observable in the initial state\nvanishes. Svensson's argument is analyzed and shown to be inconsistent using\nseveral examples.\n", "  The $J/\\psi$ meson has negative $G$-parity so that, in the limit of isospin\nconservation, its decay into $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ should be purely electromagnetic.\nHowever, the measured branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-)$\nexceeds by more than 3.9 standard deviations the expectation computed according\nto BaBar data on the $e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section. The possibility that\nthe two-gluon plus one-photon decay mechanism is not suppressed by $G$-parity\nconservation is discussed, even by considering other multi-pion decay channels.\nAs also obtained by phenomenological computation, such a decay mechanism could\nbe responsible for the observed discrepancy. Finally, we notice that the BESIII\nexperiment, having the potential to perform an accurate measurement of the\n$e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross section in the 3 GeV energy region, can definitely\nprove or disprove this strong $G$-parity-violating mechanism by confirming or\nconfuting the BaBar data.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are highly promising candidates for future spintronic\napplications such as skyrmion racetrack memories and logic devices. They\nexhibit exotic and complex dynamics governed by topology and are less\ninfluenced by defects, such as edge roughness, than conventionally used domain\nwalls. In particular, their finite topological charge leads to a predicted\n\"skyrmion Hall effect\", in which current-driven skyrmions acquire a transverse\nvelocity component analogous to charged particles in the conventional Hall\neffect. Here, we present nanoscale pump-probe imaging that for the first time\nreveals the real-time dynamics of skyrmions driven by current-induced spin\norbit torque (SOT). We find that skyrmions move at a well-defined angle\n{\\Theta}_{SH} that can exceed 30{\\deg} with respect to the current flow, but in\ncontrast to theoretical expectations, {\\Theta}_{SH} increases linearly with\nvelocity up to at least 100 m/s. We explain our observation based on internal\nmode excitations in combination with a field-like SOT, showing that one must go\nbeyond the usual rigid skyrmion description to unravel the dynamics.\n", "  Renormalization group equations are an essential tool for the description of\ntheories accross different energy scales. Even though their expressions at\ntwo-loop for an arbitrary gauge field theory have been known for more than\nthirty years, deriving the full set of equations for a given model by hand is\nvery challenging and prone to errors. To tackle this issue, we have introduced\nin [1] a Python tool called PyR@TE; Python Renormalization group equations @\nTwo-loop for Everyone. With PyR@TE, it is easy to implement a given Lagrangian\nand derive the complete set of two-loop RGEs for all the parameters of the\ntheory. In this paper, we present the new version of this code, PyR@TE 2, which\nbrings many new features and in particular it incorporates kinetic mixing when\nseveral $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge groups are involved. In addition, the group\ntheory part has been greatly improved as we introduced a new Python module\ndubbed PyLie that deals with all the group theoretical aspects required for the\ncalculation of the RGEs as well as providing very useful model building\ncapabilities. This allows the use of any irreducible representation of the\n$\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, $\\mathrm{SO}(2n)$ and $\\mathrm{SO(2n+1)}$ groups. %\nFurthermore, it is now possible to implement terms in the Lagrangian involving\nfields which can be contracted into gauge singlets in more than one way. As a\nbyproduct, results for a popular model (SM+complex triplet) for which, to our\nknowledge, the complete set of two-loop RGEs has not been calculated before are\npresented in this paper. Finally, the two-loop RGEs for the anomalous dimension\nof the scalar and fermion fields have been implemented as well. It is now\npossible to export the coupled system of beta functions into a numerical C++\nfunction, leading to a consequent speed up in solving them.\n", "  We demonstrate the implementation of a ring cavity to enhance the efficiency\nof parametric four-wave mixing in rubidium. Using an input coupler with 95%\nreflectance, a finesse of 19.6$\\pm$0.5 is achieved with a rubidium cell inside.\nThis increases the circulating intensity by a factor of 5.6$\\pm$0.5, and\nthrough two-photon excitation on the $5s_{1/2}\\rightarrow5d_{5/2}$ transition\nwith a single excitation laser, up to 1.9$\\pm$0.3 mW of power at 420 nm is\ngenerated, 50 times what was previously generated with this scheme. The\ndependence of the output on Rb density and input power has been explored,\nsuggesting the process may be approaching saturation. The blue output of the\ncavity also shows greatly improved spatial quality, combining to make this a\npromising source of 420 nm light for future experiments.\n", "  Given the complexity of modern cosmological parameter inference where we are\nfaced with non-Gaussian data and noise, correlated systematics and multi-probe\ncorrelated data sets, the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method is a\npromising alternative to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches in the\ncase where the Likelihood is intractable or unknown. The ABC method is called\n\"Likelihood free\" as it avoids explicit evaluation of the Likelihood by using a\nforward model simulation of the data which can include systematics. We\nintroduce astroABC, an open source ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for\nparameter estimation. A key challenge in astrophysics is the efficient use of\nlarge multi-probe datasets to constrain high dimensional, possibly correlated\nparameter spaces. With this in mind astroABC allows for massive parallelization\nusing MPI, a framework that handles spawning of jobs across multiple nodes. A\nkey new feature of astroABC is the ability to create MPI groups with different\ncommunicators, one for the sampler and several others for the forward model\nsimulation, which speeds up sampling time considerably. For smaller jobs the\nPython multiprocessing option is also available. Other key features include: a\nSequential Monte Carlo sampler, a method for iteratively adapting tolerance\nlevels, local covariance estimate using scikit-learn's KDTree, modules for\nspecifying optimal covariance matrix for a component-wise or multivariate\nnormal perturbation kernel, output and restart files are backed up every\niteration, user defined metric and simulation methods, a module for specifying\nheterogeneous parameter priors including non-standard prior PDFs, a module for\nspecifying a constant, linear, log or exponential tolerance level,\nwell-documented examples and sample scripts. This code is hosted online at\nhttps://github.com/EliseJ/astroABC\n", "  Whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators are an important building block for\nlinear, nonlinear and quantum optical experiments. In such experiments,\nindependent control of coupling rates to different modes can lead to improved\nconversion efficiencies and greater flexibility in generation of non-classical\nstates based on parametric down conversion. In this work, we introduce a scheme\nwhich enables selective out-coupling of WGMs belonging to a specific\npolarization family, while the orthogonally polarized modes remain largely\nunperturbed. Our technique utilizes material birefringence in both the\nresonator and coupler such that a negative (positive) birefringence allows\nselective coupling to TE (TM) polarized WGMs. We formulate a new coupling\ncondition suitable for describing the case where the refractive indices of the\nresonator and the coupler are almost the same, from which we derive the\ncriterion for polarization-selective coupling. We experimentally demonstrate\nour proposed method using a lithium niobate disk resonator coupled to a lithium\nniobate prism, where we show a 22dB suppression of coupling to TM modes\nrelative to TE modes.\n", "  A conservative constraint on the rest mass of the photon can be estimated\nunder the assumption that the frequency dependence of dispersion from\nastronomical sources is mainly contributed by the nonzero photon mass effect.\nPhoton mass limits have been earlier set through the optical emissions of the\nCrab Nebula pulsar, but we prove that these limits can be significantly\nimproved with the dispersion measure (DM) measurements of radio pulsars in the\nLarge and Small Magellanic Clouds. The combination of DM measurements of\npulsars and distances of the Magellanic Clouds provide a strict upper limit on\nthe photon mass as low as $m_{\\gamma} \\leq2.0\\times10^{-45}~\\rm{g}$, which is\nat least four orders of magnitude smaller than the constraint from the Crab\nNebula pulsar. Although our limit is not as tight as the current best result\n($\\sim10^{-47}~\\rm{g}$) from a fast radio burst (FRB 150418) at a cosmological\ndistance, the cosmological origin of FRB 150418 remains under debate; and our\nlimit can reach the same high precision of FRB 150418 when it has an\nextragalactic origin ($\\sim10^{-45}~\\rm{g}$).\n", "  This paper examines impulsive non-autonomous systems with grazing periodic\nsolutions. Surfaces of discontinuity and impact functions of the systems are\nnot depending on the time variable. That is, we can say that the impact\nconditions are stationary, and this makes necessity to study the problem in a\nnew way. The models play exceptionally important role in mechanics and\nelectronics. A concise review on the sufficient conditions for the new type of\nlinearization is presented. The existence and stability of periodic solutions\nare considered under the circumstance of the regular perturbation. To visualize\nthe theoretical results, mechanical examples are presented.\n", "  Nowadays there is a growing interest in Particle Therapy treatments\nexploiting light ion beams against tumors due to their enhanced Relative\nBiological Effectiveness and high space selectivity. In particular promising\nresults are obtained by the use of $^4$He projectiles. Unlike the treatments\nperformed using protons, the beam ions can undergo a fragmentation process when\ninteracting with the atomic nuclei in the patient body. In this paper the\nresults of measurements performed at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy center are\nreported. For the first time the absolute fluxes and the energy spectra of the\nfragments - protons, deuterons, and tritons - produced by $^4$He ion beams of\n102, 125 and 145 MeV/u energies on a poly-methyl methacrylate target were\nevaluated at different angles. The obtained results are particularly relevant\nin view of the necessary optimization and review of the Treatment Planning\nSoftware being developed for clinical use of $^4$He beams in clinical routine\nand the relative benchmarking of Monte Carlo algorithm predictions.\n", "  We show that doping of hole charge carriers leads to formation of electric\ndipolar clusters in cuprates. They are created by many-body interactions\nbetween the dopant ion outside and holes inside the CuO planes. Because of the\ntwo-fold degeneracy holes in the CuO plane cluster into four-particles\nresonance valence bond plaquettes bound with dopant ions. Such dipoles may\norder into charge-density waves (CDW) or stripes or form a disordered state\ndepending on doping and temperature. The lowest energy of the ordered system\ncorresponds to a local anti-ferroelectric ordering. The mobility of individual\ndisordered dipoles is very low at low temperatures and they prefer first to\nbind into dipole-dipole pairs. Electromagnetic radiation interacts strongly\nwith electric dipoles and when the sample is subjected to it the mobility\nchanges significantly. This leads to a fractal growth of dipolar clusters. The\nexistence of electric dipoles and CDW induce two phase transitions with\nincreasing temperature, melting of the ordered state and disappearance of the\ndipolar state. Ferroelectricity at low doping is a natural consequence of such\ndipole moments. We develop a theory based on two-level systems and\ndipole-dipole interaction to explain the behavior of the polarization as a\nfunction of temperature and electric field.\n", "  Standard neutral population genetics theory with a strictly fixed population\nsize has important limitations. An alternative model that allows independently\nfluctuating population sizes and reproduces the standard neutral evolution is\nreviewed. We then study a situation such that the competing species are neutral\nat the equilibrium population size but population size fluctuations\nnevertheless favor fixation of one species over the other. In this case, a\nseparation of timescales emerges naturally and allows adiabatic elimination of\na fast population size variable to deduce the fluctuations-induced selection\ndynamics near the equilibrium population size. The results highlight the\nincompleteness of the standard population genetics with a strictly fixed\npopulation size.\n", "  We present Keck/MOSFIRE spectra of the diagnostic nebular emission lines\n[OIII]5007,4959, [OII]3727, and H-beta for a sample of 15 redshift z=3.1-3.7\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). In conjunction with\nspectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a\nmuch higher [OIII]/[OII] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By\ncomparing their distributions on a [OIII]/[OII] versus R23 diagram, we\ndemonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower\nmetallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using\nmeasures of H-beta and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of\nour LAEs, that xi_ion - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity\n- is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts.\nUsing photoionization models we estimate the effect this would have on both\n[OIII]/[OII] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially\nexplain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a\nlarge [OIII]/[OII] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound\nnebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons.\nWe discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly\nLAEs with intense [OIII] emission represent a promising analog of those z>7\nsources with similarly strong lines which are thought to be an important\ncontributor to cosmic reionization.\n", "  The pairing anti-halo effect is a phenomenon that a pairing correlation\nsuppresses a divergence of nuclear radius, which happens for single-particle\nstates with orbital angular momenta of $l$ = 0 and 1 in the limit of vanishing\nbinding energy. While this effect has mainly been discussed in terms of\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, we here use a three-body model and\nprovide its new intuitive concept as a localized wave packet for a\nquasi-particle, that is, a coherent superposition of a weakly bound and\ncontinuum wave functions due to a pairing interaction. We show that the\none-particle density in the three-body model can be directly expressed with\nsuch quasi-particle wave functions, which have a close analog to wave functions\nin the HFB approximation.\n", "  We evaluate performance of associative memory in a neural network by based on\nthe singular value decomposition (SVD) of image data stored in the network. We\nconsider the situation in which the original image and its highly\ncoarse-grained one by SVD are stored in the network and the intermediate one is\ntaken as an input. We find that the performance is characterized by the\nsnapshot-entropy scaling inherent in the SVD: the network retrieves the\noriginal image when the entropy of the input image is larger than the critical\nvalue determined from the scaling. The result indicates efficiency of the SVD\nas a criterion of the performance and also indicates universality of the\nscaling for realistic problems beyond theoretical physics.\n", "  In this paper we study tree-level amplitudes from higher-dimensional\noperators, including $F^3$ operator of gauge theory, and $R^2$, $R^3$ operators\nof gravity, in the Cachazo-He-Yuan formulation. As a generalization of the\nreduced Pfaffian in Yang-Mills theory, we find a new, gauge-invariant object\nthat leads to gluon amplitudes with a single insertion of $F^3$, and gravity\namplitudes by Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations. When reduced to four dimensions for\ngiven helicities, the new object vanishes for any solution of scattering\nequations on which the reduced Pfaffian is non-vanishing. This intriguing\nbehavior in four dimensions explains the vanishing of graviton helicity\namplitudes produced by the Gauss-Bonnet $R^2$ term, and provides a\nscattering-equation origin of the decomposition into self-dual and\nanti-self-dual parts for $F^3$ and $R^3$ amplitudes.\n", "  The aim of this review is to provide a concise overview of some of the\ngeneric approaches that have been developed to deal with the statistical\ndescription of large systems of interacting dissipative 'units'. The latter\nnotion includes, e.g., inelastic grains, active or self-propelled particles,\nbubbles in a foam, low-dimensional dynamical systems like driven oscillators,\nor even spatially extended modes like Fourier modes of the velocity field in a\nfluid for instance. We first review methods based on the statistical properties\nof a single unit, starting with elementary mean-field approximations, either\nstatic or dynamic, that describe a unit embedded in a 'self-consistent'\nenvironment. We then discuss how this basic mean-field approach can be extended\nto account for spatial dependences, in the form of space-dependent mean-field\nFokker-Planck equations for example. We also briefly review the use of kinetic\ntheory in the framework of the Boltzmann equation, which is an appropriate\ndescription for dilute systems. We then turn to descriptions in terms of the\nfull $N$-body distribution, starting from exact solutions of one-dimensional\nmodels, using a Matrix Product Ansatz method when correlations are present.\nSince exactly solvable models are scarce, we also present some approximation\nmethods that can be used to determine the $N$-body distribution in a large\nsystem of dissipative units. These methods include the Edwards approach for\ndense granular matter and the approximate treatment of multiparticle Langevin\nequations with coloured noise, which models systems of self-propelled\nparticles. Throughout this review, emphasis is put on methodological aspects of\nthe statistical modeling and on formal similarities between different physical\nproblems, rather than on the specific behaviour of a given system.\n", "  We have developed a single-shot terahertz time-domain spectrometer to perform\noptical-pump/terahertz-probe experiments in pulsed, high magnetic fields up to\n30 T. The single-shot detection scheme for measuring a terahertz waveform\nincorporates a reflective echelon to create time-delayed beamlets across the\nintensity profile of the optical gate beam before it spatially and temporally\noverlaps with the terahertz radiation in a ZnTe detection crystal. After\nimaging the gate beam onto a camera, we can retrieve the terahertz time-domain\nwaveform by analyzing the resulting image. To demonstrate the utility of our\ntechnique, we measured cyclotron resonance absorption of optically excited\ncarriers in the terahertz frequency range in intrinsic silicon at high magnetic\nfields, with results that agree well with published values.\n", "  Networks with memristive elements (resistors with memory) are being explored\nfor a variety of applications ranging from unconventional computing to models\nof the brain. However, analytical results that highlight the role of the graph\nconnectivity on the memory dynamics are still a few, thus limiting our\nunderstanding of these important dynamical systems. In this paper, we derive an\nexact matrix equation of motion that takes into account all the network\nconstraints of a purely memristive circuit, and we employ it to derive\nanalytical results regarding its relaxation properties. We are able to describe\nthe memory evolution in terms of orthogonal projection operators onto the\nsubspace of fundamental loop space of the underlying circuit. This orthogonal\nprojection explicitly reveals the coupling between the spatial and temporal\nsectors of the memristive circuits and compactly describes the circuit\ntopology. For the case of disordered graphs, we are able to explain the\nemergence of a power law relaxation as a superposition of exponential\nrelaxation times with a broad range of scales using random matrices. This power\nlaw is also {\\it universal}, namely independent of the topology of the\nunderlying graph but dependent only on the density of loops. In the case of\ncircuits subject to alternating voltage instead, we are able to obtain an\napproximate solution of the dynamics, which is tested against a specific\nnetwork topology. These result suggest a much richer dynamics of memristive\nnetworks than previously considered.\n", "  From the canonical binary scenario, the majority of sdBs are produced from\nlow-mass stars with degenerate cores where helium is ignited in a way of\nflashes. Due to numerical difficulties, the models of produced sdBs are\ngenerally constructed from more massive stars with non-degenerate cores,\nleaving several uncertainties on the exact characteristics of sdB stars.\nEmploying MESA, we systematically studied the characteristics of sdBs produced\nfrom the common envelope (CE) ejection channel, and found that the sdB stars\nproduced from the CE ejection channel appear to form two distinct groups on the\neffective temperature-gravity diagram. One group (the flash-mixing model)\nalmost has no H-rich envelope and crows at the hottest temperature end of the\nextremely horizontal branch (EHB), while the other group has significant H-rich\nenvelope and spreads over the whole canonical EHB region. The key factor for\nthe dichotomy of the sdB properties is the development of convection during the\nfirst helium flash, which is determined by the interior structure of the star\nafter the CE ejection. For a given initial stellar mass and a given core mass\nat the onset of the CE, if the CE ejection stops early, the star has a\nrelatively massive H-rich envelope, resulting in a canonical sdB generally. The\nfact of only a few short-orbital-period sdB binaries being in the flash-mixing\nsdB region and the lack of He-rich sdBs in short-orbital-period binaries\nindicate that the flash mixing is not very often in the products of the CE\nejection. A falling back process after the CE ejection, similar to that\nhappened in nova, is an appropriate way of increasing the envelope mass, then\nprevents the flash mixing.\n", "  The final evolution of stars in the mass range 70 - 140 solar masses is\nexplored. Depending upon their mass loss history and rotation rates, these\nstars will end their lives as pulsational pair-instability supernovae producing\na great variety of observational transients with total durations ranging from\nweeks to millennia and luminosities from 10$^{41}$ to over 10$^{44}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. No non-rotating model radiates more than $5 \\times 10^{50}$ erg of\nlight or has a kinetic energy exceeding $5 \\times 10^{51}$ erg, but greater\nenergies are possible, in principle, in magnetar-powered explosions which are\nexplored. Many events resemble Type Ibn, Icn, and IIn supernovae, and some\npotential observational counterparts are mentioned. Some PPISN can exist in a\ndormant state for extended periods, producing explosions millennia after their\nfirst violent pulse. These dormant supernovae contain bright Wolf-Rayet stars,\npossibly embedded in bright x-ray and radio sources. The relevance of PPISN to\nsupernova impostors like Eta Carinae, to super-luminous supernovae, and to\nsources of gravitational radiation is discussed. No black holes between 52 and\n133 solar masses are expected from stellar evolution in close binaries.\n", "  On a projective complex manifold, the Abelian group of Divisors maps\nsurjectively onto that of holomorphic line bundles (the Picard group). On a\n$G_2$-manifold we use coassociative submanifolds to define an analogue of the\nfirst, and a gauge theoretical equation for a connection on a gerbe to define\nan analogue of the last. Finally, we construct a map from the former to the\nlater. Finally, we construct some coassociative submanifolds in twisted\nconnected sum $G_2$-manifolds.\n", "  Previous theoretical and experimental work has put forward 50-period\nsemiconductor superlattices as fast, true random number generators at room\ntemperature. Their randomness stems from feedback between nonlinear electronic\ndynamics and stochastic processes that are intrinsic to quantum transitions.\nThis work theoretically demonstrates that shorter superlattices with higher\npotential barriers contain fully chaotic dynamics over several intervals of the\napplied bias voltage compared to the 50-periods device which presented a much\nweaker chaotic behavior. The chaos arises from deterministic dynamics, hence it\npersists even in the absence of additional stochastic processes. Moreover, the\nfrequency of the chaotic current oscillations is higher for shorter\nsuperlattices. These features should allow for faster and more robust\ngeneration of true random numbers.\n", "  By perceiving gauge invariance as an analytical tool in order to get insight\ninto the states of the \"generalized Landau problem\" (a charged quantum particle\nmoving inside a magnetic, and possibly electric field), and motivated by an\nearly article that correctly warns against a naive use of gauge transformation\nprocedures in the usual Landau problem (i.e. with the magnetic field being\nstatic and uniform), we first show how to bypass the complications pointed out\nin that article by solving the problem in full generality through gauge\ntransformation techniques in a more appropriate manner. Our solution provides\nin simple and closed analytical forms all Landau Level-wavefunctions without\nthe need to specify a particular vector potential. This we do by proper\nhandling of the so-called pseudomomentum K (or of a quantity that we term\npseudoangular momentum Lz), a method that is crucially different from the old\nwarning argument, but also from standard treatments in textbooks and in\nresearch literature (where the usual Landau wavefunctions are employed -\nlabeled with canonical momenta quantum numbers). Most importantly, we go\nfurther by showing that a similar procedure can be followed in the more\ndifficult case of spatially-nonuniform magnetic fields: in such case we define\nK and Lz as plausible generalizations of the previous ordinary case, namely as\nappropriate line integrals of the inhomogeneous magnetic field - our method\nproviding closed analytical expressions for all stationary state\nwavefunctions.. (see paper) ... also provide explicit Berry's phase\ncalculations and their connection to probability currents and ...issues in\nelementary Quantum Mechanics and Condensed Matter Physics. As an added feature,\nwe also show how the possible presence of an additional electric field can be\ntreated through a further generalization of pseudomomenta and their proper\nhandling.\n", "  Tetraneutron ($^4n$) has come back in the limelight, because of recent\nobservation of a candidate resonant state at RIBF. We propose to investigate\nthe pion double charge exchange (DCX) reaction, i.e. $^4\\mathrm{He}({\\pi}^- ,\n{\\pi}^+)$, as an alternative way to populate tetraneutron. An intense ${\\pi}^-$\nbeam with the kinetic energy of ~850 MeV, much higher than that in past\nexperiments at LAMPF and TRIUMF, will open up a possibility to improve the\nexperimental sensitivity of the formation cross section, which will be much\nsmaller than hitherto known DCX cross sections such as $^9\\mathrm{Be}({\\pi}^-,\n{\\pi}^+)^9\\mathrm{He}\\ (g.s.)$.\n", "  An articulation point in a network is a node whose removal disconnects the\nnetwork. Those nodes play key roles in ensuring connectivity of many real-world\nnetworks, from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and\nterrorist communication networks. Despite their fundamental importance, a\ngeneral framework of studying articulation points in complex networks is\nlacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study key issues pertinent to\narticulation points, e.g. the expected number of them and the network\nvulnerability against their removal, in an arbitrary complex network. We find\nthat a greedy articulation point removal process provides us a novel\nperspective on the organizational principles of complex networks. Moreover,\nthis process is associated with two fundamentally different types of\npercolation transitions with a rich phase diagram. Our results shed light on\nthe design of more resilient infrastructure networks and the effective\ndestruction of terrorist communication networks.\n", "  We infer dark matter properties from gamma ray residuals extracted using\neight different interstellar emission scenarios proposed by the Fermi-LAT\nCollaboration to explain the Galactic Center gamma ray excess. Adopting the\nmost plausible simplified ansatz, we assume that the dark matter particle is a\nMajorana fermion interacting with standard fermions via a scalar mediator.\nUsing this theoretical hypothesis and the Fermi residuals we calculate Bayesian\nevidences, including Fermi-LAT exclusion limits from 15 dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies as well. Our Bayes factors single out four of the Fermi scenarios as\ncompatible with the simplified dark matter model. In the most preferred\nscenario the dark matter (mediator) mass is in the 100-500 (1-200) GeV range\nand its annihilation is dominated by top quark final state. Less preferred but\nstill plausible is annihilation into b\\bar{b} and tau^+tau^- final states with\nan order of magnitude lower dark matter mass. Our conclusion is that the\nproperties of dark matter extracted from gamma ray data are highly sensitive to\nthe modeling of the interstellar emission.\n", "  We propose a new approach to strong coupling series and dual representations\nfor non-abelian lattice gauge theories using the SU(2) case as an example. The\nWilson gauge action is written as a sum over \"abelian color cycles\" (ACC) which\ncorrespond to loops in color space around plaquettes. The ACCs are complex\nnumbers which can be commuted freely such that the strong coupling series and\nthe dual representation can be obtained as in the abelian case. Using a\nsuitable representation of the SU(2) gauge variables we integrate out all\noriginal gauge links and identify the constraints for the dual variables in the\nSU(2) case. We show that the construction can be generalized to the case of\nSU(2) gauge fields with staggered fermions. The result is a strong coupling\nseries where all gauge integrals are known in closed form and we discuss its\napplicability for possible dual simulations. The abelian color cycle concept\ncan be generalized to other non-abelian gauge groups such as SU(3).\n", "  If dark matter is an axion-like-particle a significant fraction of the\npresent day relic abundance could be concentrated in compact gravitationally\nbound miniclusters. We study the minicluster masses compatible with the dark\nmatter relic density constraint. If they form from fluctuations produced by PQ\nsymmetry breaking, minicluster masses up to hundreds of solar masses are\npossible, although over most of the parameter space they are much lighter. The\nsize of these objects is typically within a few orders of magnitude of an\nastronomical unit. We also show that miniclusters can form if an axion gets\nmass from a hidden sector with a first order phase transition that takes a\nrelatively long time to complete. Therefore they can appear in models where PQ\nsymmetry is broken before inflation, compatible with large axion decay\nconstants and string theory UV completions.\n", "  There has been rapidly growing interest in hybrid quantum devices involving a\nsolid-state spin and a macroscopic mechanical oscillator. Such hybrid devices\ncreate exciting opportunities to mediate interactions between disparate qubits\nand to explore the quantum regime of macroscopic mechanical objects. In\nparticular, a system consisting of the nitrogen-vacancy defect center in\ndiamond coupled to a high quality factor mechanical oscillator is an appealing\ncandidate for such a hybrid quantum device, as it utilizes the highly coherent\nand versatile spin properties of the defect center. In this paper, we will\nreview recent experimental progress on diamond-based hybrid quantum devices in\nwhich the spin and orbital dynamics of single defects are driven by the motion\nof a mechanical oscillator. In addition, we discuss prospective applications\nfor this device, including long range, phonon-mediated spin-spin interactions,\nand phonon cooling in the quantum regime. We conclude the review by evaluating\nthe experimental limitations of current devices and identifying alternative\ndevice architectures that may reach the strong coupling regime.\n", "  By integrating out the heavy fields in type II or heterotic string field\ntheory one can construct the effective action for the light fields. This\neffective theory inherits all the algebraic structures of the parent theory and\nthe effective action automatically satisfies the Batalin-Vilkovisky quantum\nmaster equation. This theory is manifestly ultraviolet finite, has only light\nfields as its explicit degrees of freedom, and the Feynman diagrams of this\ntheory reproduce the exact scattering amplitudes of light states in string\ntheory to any arbitrary order in perturbation theory. Furthermore in this\ntheory the degrees of freedom of light fields above certain energy scale are\nalso implicitly integrated out. This energy scale is determined by a particular\nparameter labelling a family of equivalent actions, and can be made arbitrarily\nlow, leading to the interpretation of the effective action as the Wilsonian\neffective action.\n", "  We perform further tests of the correspondence between spectral theory and\ntopological strings, focusing on mirror curves of genus greater than one with\nnontrivial mass parameters. In particular, we analyze the geometry relevant to\nthe SU(3) relativistic Toda lattice, and the resolved C^3/Z_6 orbifold.\nFurthermore, we give evidence that the correspondence holds for arbitrary\nvalues of the mass parameters, where the quantization problem leads to resonant\nstates. We also explore the relation between this correspondence and cluster\nintegrable systems.\n", "  In this article we study the algebra generated by the holographically\nreconstructed cubic couplings for the type A minimal bosonic higher-spin theory\non AdS$_{d+1}$, which were recently extracted from the free scalar $O(N)$\nmodel. We demonstrate that it is equal to the unique higher-spin algebra for\nbosonic totally symmetric higher-spin fields in generic dimensions. This\nprovides an explicit check of the holographic reconstruction and of the duality\nbetween higher-spin theories and the free $O(N)$ model in general dimensions,\nextending the result of Giombi and Yin in AdS$_4$. For completeness, we also\naddress the same problem in the flat space for the cubic couplings derived by\nMetsaev in 1991, which are recovered in the flat limit of the AdS type-A cubic\ncouplings. We observe that both flat and AdS$_4$ higher-spin Lorentz\nsubalgebras coincide, hinting towards the existence of a full higher-spin\nsymmetry behind the flat-space cubic couplings of Metsaev.\n", "  Stellar streams result from the tidal disruption of satellites and star\nclusters as they orbit a host galaxy, and can be very sensitive probes of the\ngravitational potential of the host system. We select and study narrow stellar\nstreams formed in a Milky-Way-like dark matter halo of the Aquarius suite of\ncosmological simulations, to determine if these streams can be used to\nconstrain the present day characteristic parameters of the halo's gravitational\npotential. We find that orbits integrated in static spherical and triaxial NFW\npotentials both reproduce the locations and kinematics of the various streams\nreasonably well. To quantify this further, we determine the best-fit potential\nparameters by maximizing the amount of clustering of the stream stars in the\nspace of their actions. We show that using our set of Aquarius streams, we\nrecover a mass profile that is consistent with the spherically-averaged dark\nmatter profile of the host halo, although we ignored both triaxiality and time\nevolution in the fit. This gives us confidence that such methods can be applied\nto the many streams that will be discovered by the Gaia mission to determine\nthe gravitational potential of our Galaxy.\n", "  The Hamamatsu R11410-21 photomultiplier tube is the photodetector of choice\nfor the XENON1T dual-phase time projection chamber. The device has been\noptimized for a very low intrinsic radioactivity, a high quantum efficiency and\na high sensitivity to single photon detection. A total of 248 tubes are\ncurrently operated in XENON1T, selected out of 321 tested units. In this\narticle the procedures implemented to evaluate the large number of tubes prior\nto their installation in XENON1T are described. The parameter distributions for\nall tested tubes are shown, with an emphasis on those selected for XENON1T, of\nwhich the impact on the detector performance is discussed. All photomultipliers\nhave been tested in a nitrogen atmosphere at cryogenic temperatures, with a\nsubset of the tubes being tested in gaseous and liquid xenon, simulating their\noperating conditions in the dark matter detector. The performance and\nevaluation of the tubes in the different environments is reported and the\ncriteria for rejection of PMTs are outlined and quantified.\n", "  In this work we introduce the contact Heisenberg algebra which is the\nrestriction of the Jacobi algebra on contact manifolds to the linear and\nconstant functions. We give the exact expression of its corresponding\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We argue that this result is relevant to the\nquantization of contact systems.\n", "  In a noncentral heavy-ion collision, the two colliding nuclei have finite\nangular momentum in the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane. After\nthe collision, a fraction of the total angular momentum is retained in the\nproduced hot quark-gluon matter and is manifested in the form of fluid shear.\nSuch fluid shear creates finite flow vorticity. We study some features of such\ngenerated vorticity, including its strength, beam energy dependence, centrality\ndependence, and spatial distribution.\n", "  We present a molecular dynamics simulation of shock waves propagating in\ndense deuterium with the electron force field method [J. T. Su and W. A.\nGoddard, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 185003 (2007)], which explicitly takes the\nexcitation of electrons into consideration. Non-equilibrium features associated\nwith the excitation of electrons are systematically investigated. We show that\nchemical bonds in D$_2$ molecules lead to a more complicated shock wave\nstructure near the shock front, compared with the results of classical\nmolecular dynamics simulation. Charge separation can bring about accumulation\nof net charges on the large scale, instead of the formation of a localized\ndipole layer, which might cause extra energy for the shock wave to propagate.\nIn addition, the simulations also display that molecular dissociation at the\nshock front is the major factor corresponding to the \"bump\" structure in the\nprincipal Hugoniot. These results could help to build a more realistic picture\nof shock wave propagation in fuel materials commonly used in the inertial\nconfinement fusion.\n", "  We study the magnetic coupling between different ferromagnetic metals (FMs)\nacross a graphene (G) layer, and the role of graphene as a thin covalent\nspacer. Starting with G grown on a FM substrate (Ni or Co), we deposit on top\nat room temperature different FM metals (Fe, Ni, Co). By measuring the dichroic\neffect of 3p photoemission lines we detect the magnetization of the substrate\nand the sign of the exchange coupling in FM overlayer at room temperature. We\nshow that the G layer magnetically decouples the FM metals.\n", "  Here, we report on successful operation of a NbN thin film superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) in a coherent mode (as a mixer) at the\ntelecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. Providing the Local Oscillator power\nof the order of a few picowatts, we were practically able to reach the quantum\nnoise limited sensitivity. The intermediate frequency gain bandwidth was\nlimited by the spectral band of single-photon response pulse of the detector,\nwhich is proportional to the detector size. We observed gain bandwidth of 65\nMHz and 140 MHz for 7x7 um^2 and 3x3 um^2 devices respectively. Tiny amount of\nthe required Local Oscillator power and wide gain and noise bandwidths along\nwith the needless of any Low Noise Amplification opens possibility for a photon\ncounting heterodyne-born megapixel array development.\n", "  Recently, the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) reported two new\ninteresting results for a gamma-ray emitting supernova remnant, RX J1713.7-3946\n(G347.3-0.5). The first result is the establishment of a broken power-law\nspectrum of GeV-TeV gamma-rays. The other is a more extended gamma-ray spatial\nprofile than the one in the X-ray band. In this paper, we show both of these\nresults can be explained by inverse Compton emission from accelerated\nelectrons. If the maximum energy of electrons being accelerated decreases with\ntime, the broken power-law spectrum can be generated by accumulation.\nFurthermore, the extended component of gamma-ray profile can be interpreted as\na CR precursor of currently accelerated electrons.\n", "  Numerous papers have appeared recently showing fits to transverse momentum\n($p_T$) spectra measured at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in proton - proton\ncollisions.This talk focuses on the fits extending to very large values of the\ntransverse momentum with $p_T$ values up to 200 GeV/c as measured by the ATLAS\nand CMS collaborations at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 and 7 TeV. A thermodynamically\nconsistent form of the Tsallis distribution is used for fitting the transverse\nmomentum spectra at mid-rapidity. The fits based on the proposed distribution\nprovide an excellent description over 14 orders of magnitude. Despite this\nsuccess, an ambiguity is noted concerning the determination of the parameters\nin the Tsallis distribution. This prevents drawing firm conclusions as to the\nuniversality of the parameters appearing in the Tsallis distribution.\n", "  We have used the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method with Metropolis algorithm\nto study the finite temperature phase transition properties of a binary alloy\nspherical nanoparticle with radius $r$ of the type $A_{p}B_{1-p}$. The system\nconsists of two different species of magnetic components, namely, $A$ and $B$,\nand the components of the system have been selected $A$ and $B$ to be as\n$\\sigma = 1/2$ and $S=1$, respectively. A complete picture of phase diagrams,\ntotal magnetizations and susceptibilities in related planes have been\npresented, and the main roles of the radius of nanoparticle, active\nconcentration value of type-$A$ atoms as well as other system parameters on the\nthermal and magnetic phase transition features of the considered system have\nbeen discussed in detail. Our MC investigations clearly show that it is\npossible to control the critical characteristic behaviors of the system with\nthe help of adjustable Hamiltonian parameters.\n", "  We study the main astrophysical properties of differentially rotating neutron\nstars described as stationary and axisymmetric configurations of a moderately\nstiff $\\Gamma=2$ polytropic fluid. The high level of accuracy and of stability\nof our relativistic multidomain pseudo-spectral code enables us to explore the\nwhole solution space for broad ranges of the degree of differential rotation,\nbut also of the stellar density and oblateness. Staying within an\nastrophysicaly motivated range of rotation profiles, we investigate the\ncharacteristics of neutron stars with maximal mass for all types of families of\ndifferentially rotating relativistic objects identified in a previous article\nAnsorg, Gondek-Rosinsla, Villain (2009). We find that the maximum mass depends\non both the degree of differential rotation and on the type of solution. It\nturns out that the maximum allowed mass can be up to 4 times higher than what\nit is for non-rotating stars with the same equation of state. Such values are\nobtained for a modest degree of differential rotation but for one of the newly\ndiscovered type of solutions. Since such configurations of stars are not that\nextreme, this result may have important consequences for the gravitational wave\nsignal to expect from coalescing neutron star binaries or from some supernovae\nevents.\n", "  We utilize the recent LHC-13 TeV data to study the lower mass bound on\ntop-squark (stop) in natural supersymmetry. We recast the LHC sparticle\ninclusive search of $(\\ge 1){\\rm jets} + E^{miss}_T$ with $\\alpha_T$ variable,\nthe direct stop pair search (1-lepton channel and all-hadronic channel) and the\nmonojet analyses. We find that these searches are complementary depending on\nstop and higgsino masses: for a heavy stop the all-hadronic stop pair search\nprovides the strongest bound, for an intermediate stop the inclusive SUSY\nanalysis with $\\alpha_T$ variable is most efficient, while for a compressed\nstop-higgsino scenario the monojet search plays the key role. Finally, the\nlower mass bound on a stop is: (i) 320 GeV for compressed stop-higgsino\nscenario (mass splitting less than 20 GeV); (ii) 765 (860) GeV for higgsinos\nlighter than 300 (100) GeV.\n", "  The vast majority of market impact studies assess each product individually,\nand the interactions between the different order flows are disregarded. This\nstrong approximation may lead to an underestimation of trading costs and\npossible contagion effects. Transactions in fact mediate a significant part of\nthe correlation between different instruments. In turn, liquidity shares the\nsectorial structure of market correlations, which can be encoded as a set of\neigenvalues and eigenvectors. We introduce a multivariate linear propagator\nmodel that successfully describes such a structure, and accounts for a\nsignificant fraction of the covariance of stock returns. We dissect the various\ndynamical mechanisms that contribute to the joint dynamics of assets. We also\ndefine two simplified models with substantially less parameters in order to\nreduce overfitting, and show that they have superior out-of-sample performance.\n", "  Precision tests of the Standard Model in the Strong and Electroweak sectors\nplay an important role, among the physics goals of LHC experiments. Because of\nthe nature of proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of\nthe direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures.\n  In the present paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of leptons\nfrom W to l nu decays in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the\nintermediate state imposes that distributions are to a good precision described\nby spherical polynomials of at most second order. We argue, that contrary to\ngeneral belief often expressed in the literature, the full set of angular\ncoefficients can be measured experimentally, despite the presence in the final\nstate of neutrino escaping detection. There is thus no principle difference\nwith respect to the phenomenology of the Z/gamma to l^+ l^- Drell-Yan process.\n  We show also, that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one\ncoefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the\npresence of one or more high p_T jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the\nframes relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants. In this\nway, electroweak effects (dominated by the V-A nature of W couplings to\nfermions) can be better separated from the ones of strong interactions. The\nseparation is convenient for the measurements interpretation.\n", "  The relevance of chiral symmetry in baryons is highlighted in three examples\nin the nucleon spectroscopy and structure. The first one is the importance of\nchiral dynamics in understanding the Roper resonance. The second one is the\nrole of chiral symmetry in the lattice calculation of $\\pi N \\sigma$ term and\nstrangeness. The third one is the role of chiral $U(1)$ anomaly in the\nanomalous Ward identity in evaluating the quark spin and the quark orbital\nangular momentum. Finally, the chiral effective theory for baryons is\ndiscussed.\n", "  This proceeding briefly summarizes our recent investigations on the\ncorrelations of flow harmonics in 2.76A TeV Pb--Pb collisions with viscous\nhydrodynamics {\\tt VISH2+1}. We calculated both the symmetric cumulants\n$SC^{v}(m, n)$ and the normalized symmetric cumulants $NSC^{v}(m, n)$, and\nfound $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$, $v_{2}$ and $v_{5}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{5}$ are\ncorrelated, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ are anti-correlated. We\nalso found $NSC^{v}(3, 2)$ are insensitive to the QGP viscosity, which are\nmainly determined by the initial conditions.\n", "  We present fully covered phased light curves for 56 Jovian Trojan asteroids\nas acquired by the K2 mission of the Kepler space telescope. This set of\nobjects has been monitored during Campaign 6 and represents a nearly unbiased\nsubsample of the population of small Solar System bodies. We derived precise\nperiods and amplitudes for all Trojans, and found their distributions to be\ncompatible with the previous statistics. We point out, however, that\nground-based rotation periods are often unreliable above 20h, and we find an\noverabundance of rotation periods above 60h compared with other minor planet\npopulations. From amplitude analysis we derive a rate of binarity of 20$\\pm$\n5%. Our spin rate distribution confirms the previously obtained spin barrier of\n~5h and the corresponding ~0.5 g cm$^{-3}$ cometary-like density limit, also\nsuggesting a high internal porosity for Jovian Trojans. One of our targets,\nasteroid 65227 exhibits a double rotation period, which can either be due to\nbinarity or the outcome of a recent collision.\n", "  We analyze the gravity-induced effects associated with a massless scalar\nfield in a higher-dimensional spacetime being the tensor product of\n$(d-n)$-dimensional Minkowski space and $n$-dimensional\nspherically/cylindrically-symmetric space with a solid/planar angle deficit.\nThese spacetimes are considered as simple models for a multidimensional global\nmonopole (if \\mbox{$n\\geqslant 3$}) or cosmic string (if $n=2$) with $(d-n-1)$\nflat extra dimensions. Thus, we refer to them as conical backgrounds. In terms\nof the angular deficit value, we derive the perturbative expression for the\nscalar Green's function, valid for any $d\\geqslant 3$ and $2\\leqslant\nn\\leqslant d-1$, and compute it to the leading order. With the use of this\nGreen's function we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the\nfield square $\\langle \\phi^{2}(x)\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ren}}$ and the renormalized\nvacuum averaged of the scalar-field's energy-momentum tensor $\\langle T_{M\nN}(x)\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ren}}$ for arbitrary $d$ and $n$ from the interval\nmentioned above and arbitrary coupling constant to the curvature $\\xi$. In\nparticular, we revisit the computation of the vacuum polarization effects for a\nnon-minimally coupled massless scalar field in the spacetime of a straight\ncosmic string. The same Green's function enables to consider the old purely\nclassical problem of the gravity-induced self-action of a classical pointlike\nscalar or electric charge, placed at rest at some fixed point of the space\nunder consideration. To deal with divergences, which appear in consideration of\nthe both problems, we apply the dimensional-regularization technique, widely\nused in quantum field theory (QFT). The explicit dependence of the results upon\nthe dimensionalities of both the bulk and conical submanifold, is discussed.\n", "  The correlation tensors of magnetic field in a two-dimensional chaotic flow\nof conducting fluid are studied. It is shown that there is a stage of resistive\nevolution where the field correlators grow exponentially with time what\ncontradicts to the statements present in literature. The two- and four-point\nfield correlation tensors are computed explicitly in this stage in the\nframework of Batchelor-Kraichnan-Kazantsev model.\n  These tensors demonstrate highly intermittent statistics of the field\nfluctuations both in space and time.\n", "  Ag nanoparticles in the form of colloids and ordered arrays are used to\ndemonstrate plasmon-mediated non-radiative energy transfer from quantum dots to\nquantum wells with varying top barrier thicknesses. Plasmon-mediated energy\ntransfer efficiencies of up to ~25% are observed with the Ag colloids. The\ndistance dependence of the plasmon-mediated energy transfer is found to follow\nthe same d^{-4} dependence as the direct quantum dot to quantum well energy\ntransfer. There is also evidence for an increase in the characteristic distance\nof the interaction, thus indicating that it follows a F\\\"orster-like model with\nthe Ag nanoparticle-quantum dot acting as an enhanced donor dipole. Ordered Ag\nnanoparticle arrays display plasmon-mediated energy transfer efficiencies up to\n~21%. To explore the tunability of the array system, two arrays with different\ngeometries are presented. It is demonstrated that changing the geometry of the\narray allows a transition from overall quenching of the acceptor quantum well\nemission to enhancement, as well as control of the competition between the\nquantum dot donor quenching and energy transfer rates.\n", "  Non-standard interactions in the propagation of neutrinos in matter can lead\nto significant deviations from expectations within the standard neutrino\noscillation framework and atmospheric neutrino detectors have been considered\nto set constraints. However, most previous works have focused on relatively\nlow-energy atmospheric neutrino data. Here, we consider the one-year\nhigh-energy through-going muon data in IceCube, which has been already used to\nsearch for light sterile neutrinos, to constrain new interactions in the\n$\\mu\\tau$-sector. In our analysis we include several systematic uncertainties\non both, the atmospheric neutrino flux and on the detector properties, which\nare accounted for via nuisance parameters. After considering different primary\ncosmic-ray spectra and hadronic interaction models, we obtain the most\nstringent bound on the off-diagonal $\\varepsilon_{\\mu \\tau}$ parameter to date,\nwith the 90\\% credible interval given by $-6.0 \\times 10^{-3} <\n\\varepsilon_{\\mu \\tau} < 5.4 \\times 10^{-3}$. In addition, we also estimate the\nexpected sensitivity after 10~years of collected data in IceCube and study the\nprecision at which non-standard parameters could be determined for the case of\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mu \\tau}$ near its current bound.\n", "  The bias driven perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is a magneto-electric\neffect that can realize 90$^\\circ$ magnetization rotation and even 180$% ^\\circ\n$ flip along the easy axis in the ferromagnets with a minimal energy\nconsumption. This study theoretically demonstrates a similar phenomenon of the\nN\\'{e}el vector reversal via a short electrical pulse that can mediate\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the antiferromagnets. The analysis based\non the dynamical equations as well as the micro-magnetic simulations reveals\nthe important role of the inertial behavior in the antiferromagnets that\nfacilitates the N\\'{e}el vector to overcome the barrier between two free-energy\nminima of the bistable states along the easy axis. In contrast to the\nferromagnets, this N\\'{e}el vector reversal does not accompany angular moment\ntransfer to the environment, leading to acceleration in the dynamical response\nby a few orders of magnitude. Further, a small switching energy requirement of\na few attojoules illustrates an added advantage of the phenomenon in low-power\nspintronic applications.\n", "  Gerry Brown was a godfather of our hidden local symmetry (HLS) for the vector\nmeson from the birth of the theory throughout his life. The HLS is originated\nfrom very nature of the nonlinear realization of the symmetry G based on the\nmanifold G/H, and thus is universal to any physics based on the nonlinear\nrealization. Here I focus on the Higgs Lagrangian of the Standard Model (SM),\nwhich is shown to be equivalent to the nonlinear sigma model based on G/H=\nSU(2)_L x SU(2)_R/SU(2)_V with additional symmetry, the nonlinearly realized\nscale symmetry. Then the SM does have a dynamical gauge boson of the SU(2)_V\nHLS, \"SM rho meson\", in addition to the Higgs as a pseudo dilaton as well as\nthe NG bosons to be absorbed into the W and Z. Based on the recent work done\nwith S. Matsuzaki and H. Ohki, I discuss a novel possibility that the SM rho\nmeson acquires kinetic term by the SM dynamics itself, which then stabilizes\nthe skyrmion dormant in the SM as a viable candidate for the dark matter, what\nwe call \"Dark SM skyrmion (DSMS)\".\n", "  We present a benchmark of the density functional linear response calculation\nof NMR shieldings within the Gauge-Including Projector-Augmented-Wave method\nagainst all-electron Augmented-Plane-Wave$+$local-orbital and uncontracted\nGaussian basis set results for NMR shieldings in molecular and solid state\nsystems. In general, excellent agreement between the aforementioned methods is\nobtained. Scalar relativistic effects are shown to be quite large for nuclei in\nmolecules in the deshielded limit. The small component makes up a substantial\npart of the relativistic corrections.\n", "  We calculate the low-lying glueball spectrum and various string tensions in\nSU(N) lattice gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions, and extrapolate the results to\nthe continuum limit. We do so for for the range N=2 to N=16 so as to control\nthe N-dependence with a useful precision. We observe a number of striking\nnear-degeneracies in the various J^PC sectors of the glueball spectrum, in\nparticular between C=+ and C=- states. We calculate the string tensions of flux\ntubes in a number of representations, and provide evidence that the leading\ncorrection to the N-dependence of the k-string tensions varies as 1/N rather\nthan 1/N^2, and that the dominant binding of k fundamental flux tubes into a\nk-string is via pairwise interactions. We comment on the possible implications\nof our results for the dynamics of these gauge theories.\n", "  Magnetic topological defects, including vortices and Skyrmions, can be\nstabilized as equilibrium structures by tuning intrinsic magnetic interactions\nand stray field geometries. Here, employing rapid quench conditions, we report\nthe observation of a light-induced metastable magnetic texture, which consists\nof a dense nanoscale network of vortices and antivortices and exhibits\nglass-like properties. Our results highlight the emergence of complex ordering\nregimes in optically driven magnetic systems, opening up new pathways to\nharness ultrafast far-from-equilibrium relaxation processes.\n", "  We modify the method to generate the exact solutions of the Einstein\nequations basing on the laws of thermodynamics. Firstly, the Komar mass is used\nto take the place of the Misner-Sharp energy which is used in the original\nmethods, and then several exact solutions of Einstein equations are obtained,\nincluding the black hole solution which surrounded by quintessence. Moreover,\nthe geometry surface gravity defined by Komar mass is obtained. Secondly, we\nuse both the Komar mass and the ADM mass to modify such method, and the similar\nresults are obtained. Moreover, with some generalize added to the definition of\nthe ADM mass, our method can be generalized to global monopole sapcetime.\n", "  We study a specific version of $SU(2)_R \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_{B-L}$\nmodels extended by discrete symmetries where the new physics sector responsible\nfor tiny neutrino masses at leading order remains decoupled from the new\nphysics sector that can give rise to observable signatures of lepton number\nviolation such as neutrinoless double beta decay. More specifically, the\ndominant contribution to light neutrino masses comes from a one-loop Dirac\nmass. At higher loop level, a tiny Majorana mass also appears which remains\nsuppressed by many order of magnitudes in comparison to the Dirac mass. Such a\nmodel where the active neutrinos are predominantly of Dirac type, also predicts\nobservable charged lepton flavour violation like $\\mu \\rightarrow 3e, \\mu\n\\rightarrow e \\gamma$ and multi-component dark matter.\n", "  Femtoscopy is a technique enabling measurements of the space-time\ncharacteristics of particle-emitting sources. However, the femtoscopic analysis\nis also sensitive to the interaction cross-section. In this paper we show the\nfirst preliminary measurements of $\\rm K^0_SK^{\\pm}$ correlation functions in\nPb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. These correlations originate\nfrom the final-state interactions which proceed through the $a_0(980)$\nresonance only and can be employed to constrain its parameters. A similar\napproach can be applied to baryon pairs to extract the unknown interaction\ncross-sections for some (anti-)baryon-(anti-)baryon pairs. We show\nbaryon--baryon and baryon--anti-baryon correlation functions of protons and\nlambdas, as well as discuss shortly the fitting method.\n", "  The abundance of CH+ and OH and excitation are predicted to be enhanced by\nthe presence of vibrationally excited H2 or hot gas (~500-1000 K) in PDRs with\nhigh incident FUV radiation field. The excitation may also originate in dense\ngas (>10^5 cm-3) followed by nonreactive collisions. Previous observations\nsuggest that the CH+ and OH correlate with dense and warm gas, and formation\npumping contributes to CH+ excitation. We examine the spatial distribution of\nthe CH+ and OH emission in the Orion Bar to establish their physical origin and\nmain formation and excitation mechanisms. We present spatially sampled maps of\nthe CH+ J=3-2 transition at 119.8 {\\mu}m and the OH {\\Lambda}-doublet at 84\n{\\mu}m in the Orion Bar over an area of 110\"x110\" with Herschel (PACS). We\ncompare the spatial distribution of these molecules with those of their\nchemical precursors, C+, O and H2, and tracers of warm and dense gas. We assess\nthe spatial variation of CH+ J=2-1 velocity-resolved line profile observed with\nHerschel (HIFI). The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO\nemission and delineate the warm and dense molecular region. While similar, the\ndifferences in the CH+ and OH morphologies indicate that CH+ formation and\nexcitation are related to the observed vibrationally excited H2. This indicates\nthat formation pumping contributes to the excitation of CH+. Interestingly, the\npeak of the rotationally excited OH 84 {\\mu}m emission coincides with a bright\nyoung object, proplyd 244-440, which shows that OH can be an excellent tracer\nof UV-irradiated dense gas. The spatial distribution of CH+ and OH revealed in\nour maps is consistent with previous modeling studies. Both formation pumping\nand nonreactive collisions in a UV-irradiated dense gas are important CH+ J=3-2\nexcitation processes. The excitation of the OH {\\Lambda}-doublet at 84 {\\mu}m\nis mainly sensitive to the temperature and density.\n", "  We present empirical measurements of the radii of 116 stars that host\ntransiting planets. These radii are determined using only direct\nobservables-the bolometric flux at Earth, the effective temperature, and the\nparallax provided by the Gaia first data release-and thus are virtually model\nindependent, extinction being the only free parameter. We also determine each\nstar's mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, itself a\nvirtually model independent quantity from previously published transit\nanalyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the\ntransiting planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The\nmedian uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are ~8% and ~30%,\nrespectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses\nare ~9% and ~22%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than\npreviously published model-dependent precisions of ~5% and ~6% on the planet\nradii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely\nempirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radial-velocity\n(non-transiting) planets, with median achieved accuracy of ~2%. Using our\nempirical stellar masses we verify that the majority of putative \"retired A\nstars\" in the sample are indeed more massive than ~1.2 Msun. Most importantly,\nthe bolometric fluxes and angular radii reported here for a total of 498 planet\nhost stars-with median accuracies of 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively-serve as a\nfundamental dataset to permit the re-determination of transiting planet radii\nand masses with the Gaia second data release to ~3% and ~5% accuracy, better\nthan currently published precisions, and determined in an entirely empirical\nfashion.\n", "  We study statistical properties of synchrotron polarization emitted from\nmedia with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We use both synthetic and MHD\nturbulence simulation data for our studies. We obtain the spatial spectrum and\nits derivative with respect to wavelength of synchrotron polarization arising\nfrom both synchrotron radiation and Faraday rotation fluctuations. In\nparticular, we investigate how the spectrum changes with frequency. We find\nthat our simulations agree with the theoretical predication in Lazarian \\&\nPogosyan (2016). We conclude that the spectrum of synchrotron polarization and\nit derivative can be very informative tools to get detailed information about\nthe statistical properties of MHD turbulence from radio observations of diffuse\nsynchrotron polarization. Especially, they are useful to recover the statistics\nof turbulent magnetic field as well as turbulent density of electrons. We also\nsimulate interferometric observations that incorporate the effects of noise and\nfinite telescope beam size, and demonstrate how we recover statistics of\nunderlying MHD turbulence.\n", "  We confirm that the object DDO216-A1 is a substantial globular cluster at the\ncenter of Local Group galaxy DDO216 (the Pegasus dwarf irregular), using Hubble\nSpace Telescope ACS imaging. By fitting isochrones, we find the cluster\nmetallicity to be [M/H] = -1.6 +/-0.2, for reddening E(B-V) = 0.16 +/-0.02; the\nbest-fit age is 12.3 +/-0.8 Gyr. There are ~30 RR Lyrae variables in the\ncluster; the magnitude of the fundamental mode pulsators gives a distance\nmodulus of 24.77 +/-0.08 - identical to the host galaxy. The ratio of overtone\nto fundamental mode variables and their mean periods make DDO216-A1 an\nOosterhoff Type I cluster. We find an I-band central surface brightness 20.85\n+/-0.17 F814W mag per square arcsecond, a half-light radius of 3.1 arcsec (13.4\npc), and an absolute magnitude M814 = -7.90 +/-0.16 (approximately 10^5 solar\nmasses). King models fit to the cluster give the core radius and concentration\nindex, r_c = 2.1\" +/-0.9\" and c = 1.24 +/-0.39. The cluster is an \"extended\"\ncluster somewhat typical of some dwarf galaxies and the outer halo of the Milky\nWay. The cluster is projected <30 pc south of the center of DDO216, unusually\ncentral compared to most dwarf galaxy globular clusters. Analytical models of\ndynamical friction and tidal destruction suggest that it probably formed at a\nlarger distance, up to ~1 kpc, and migrated inward. DDO216 has an unexceptional\ncluster specific frequency, S_N = 10. DDO216 is the lowest-luminosity Local\nGroup galaxy to host a 10^5 solar mass globular cluster, and the only\ntransition-type (dSph/dIrr) in the Local Group with a globular.\n", "  Results for the kinetics of vapor-liquid phase transition have been presented\nfrom the molecular dynamics simulations of a single component two-dimensional\nLennard-Jones fluid. The phase diagram for the model, primary prerequisite for\nthis purpose, has been obtained via the Monte Carlo simulations. Our focus is\non the region very close to the vapor branch of the coexistence curve. Quenches\nto such region provide morphology that consists of disconnected circular liquid\nclusters in the vapor background. We identified that these clusters exhibit\ndiffusive motion and grow via sticky collisions among them. The growth follows\npower-law behavior with time, exponent of which is found to be in nice\nagreement with a theoretical prediction.\n", "  We revisit the problem of interactions of higher-spin fields in flat space.\nWe argue that all no-go theorems can be avoided by the light-cone approach,\nwhich results in more interaction vertices as compared to the usual covariant\napproaches. It is stressed that there exist two-derivative gravitational\ncouplings of higher-spin fields. We show that some reincarnation of the\nequivalence principle still holds for higher-spin fields - the strength of\ngravitational interaction does not depend on spin. Moreover, it follows from\nthe results by Metsaev that there exists a complete chiral higher-spin theory\nin four dimensions. We give a simple derivation of this theory and show that\nthe four-point scattering amplitude vanishes. Also, we reconstruct the quartic\nvertex of the scalar field in the unitary higher-spin theory, which turns out\nto be perturbatively local.\n", "  We show that the new data on mean multiplicities measured in p+p and A+A\ncollisions together with the updated list of resonances lead to the significant\nchanges of the obtained freeze-out lines. The new A+A line gives much smaller\ntemperatures at high collision energies and agrees with the values obtained at\nthe LHC. The newly obtained p+p line is much closer to the A+A line than\npreviously expected, and even touches it in the region where the $K^+/\\pi^+$\nhorn appears in the data. It indicates that the temperatures that will be\nobtained in the beam energy and system size scan by the NA61/SHINE\nCollaboration might be very close. However, our analysis shows that the\nchemical potentials could be very different for the same energies in A+A and\np+p. It adds more puzzles to the set of surprising coincidences at the energies\nclose to the possible onset of deconfinement.\n", "  Vapor cells with antirelaxation coating are widely used in modern atomic\nphysics experiments due to the coating's ability to maintain the atoms' spin\npolarization during wall collisions. We characterize the performance of vapor\ncells with different coating materials by measuring longitudinal spin\nrelaxation and vapor density at temperatures up to 95{\\deg}C. We found that the\nspin-projection-noise-limited sensitivity for atomic magnetometers with such\ncells improves with temperature, which demonstrates the potential of\nantirelaxation coated cells in applications of future high-sensitivity\nmagnetometers.\n", "  We calculate the production of $\\psi(2S)$ and the pertinent double ratio of\nits nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) over that of the $J/\\psi$ in\nPb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Based on a transport model with temperature\ndependent reaction rates, a sequential regeneration pattern emerges: the larger\n$\\psi(2S)$ width, relative to the $J/\\psi$, around and below the critical\ntemperature, implies that most of the $\\psi(2S)$ states are regenerated later\nin the evolution of the fireball. This has noticeable consequences for the\ntransverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra of the regenerated charmonia. While the\ntotal yield of $\\psi(2S)$ meson remains smaller than those of $J/\\psi$'s, their\nharder $p_T$ spectra can produce a double ratio above unity for a $p_T>3$GeV\ncut, as applied by the CMS collaboration. A significant uncertainty in our\ncalculations is associated with the values of the temperature where most of the\n$\\psi(2S)$ regeneration occurs, the quantitative temperature dependence of its\ninelastic width.\n", "  Constrained-occupancy self-consistent-field ($\\Delta$SCF) methods and\nmany-body perturbation theories (MBPT) are two strategies for obtaining\nelectronic excitations from first-principles. Using the two distinct\napproaches, we study the O $1s$ core excitations that have become increasingly\nimportant for characterizing transition metal oxides and developing theory of\nstrong correlations. Interestingly, we find that the $\\Delta$SCF approach, in\nits current single-particle form, systematically underestimates the pre-edge\nintensity for chosen oxides, despite its success in weakly correlated systems.\nBy contrast, the Bethe-Salpeter equation within MBPT predicts much better\nlineshapes. This inspires us to reexamine the many-electron dynamics of X-ray\nexcitations. We find that the single-particle $\\Delta$SCF approach can be\nrectified by explicitly calculating many-body transition amplitudes, producing\nX-ray spectra in excellent agreement with experiments. Our study paves the way\nto accurately predict X-ray near-edge spectral fingerprints for physics and\nmaterials science beyond the Bethe-Salpether equation.\n", "  Based on a thermodynamic $T$-matrix approach we extract the potential $V$\nbetween two static charges in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from fits to the\npertinent lattice-QCD free energy. With suitable relativistic corrections we\nutilize this new potential to compute heavy-quark transport coefficients and\ncompare the results to previous calculations using either $F$ or $U$ as\npotential. We then discuss a generalization of the $T$-matrix re-summation to a\n\"matrix $\\log$\" re-summation of $t$-channel diagrams for the grand partition\nfunction of the QGP in the Luttinger-Ward skeleton diagram formalism. With $V$\nas a non-perturbative driving kernel in the light-parton sector, we obtain the\nQGP equation of state from fits to lattice-QCD data. The resulting light-parton\nspectral functions are characterized by large thermal widths at small momenta,\nindicating the dissolution of quasi-particles in a strongly coupled QGP.\n", "  This paper presents the CMS measurements of quarkonia and open heavy flavor\nproduction in \\pp, \\pPb, and \\PbPb collisions at \\sqrtsnn = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV.\nA brief outlook of the near-future CMS heavy flavor physics analyses is\nprovided at the end.\n", "  We study in this article how heat can be exchanged between two level systems\n(TLS) each of them being coupled to a thermal reservoir. Calculation are\nperformed solving a master equation for the density matrix using the Born\nmarkov-approximation. We analyse the conditions for which a thermal diode and a\nthermal transistor can be obtained as well as their optimization.\n", "  We present a comparison of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) parallaxes with\nphotometric parallaxes for a sample of 212 Galactic Cepheids at a median\ndistance of 2~kpc, and explore their implications on the distance scale and the\nlocal value of the Hubble constant H_0. The Cepheid distances are estimated\nfrom a recent calibration of the near-infrared Period-Luminosity P-L relation.\nThe comparison is carried out in parallax space, where the DR1 parallax errors,\nwith a median value of half the median parallax, are expected to be\nwell-behaved. With the exception of one outlier, the DR1 parallaxes are in\nremarkably good global agreement with the predictions, and the published errors\nmay be conservatively overestimated by about 20%. The parallaxes of 9 Cepheids\nbrighter than G = 6 may be systematically underestimated, trigonometric\nparallaxes measured with the HST FGS for three of these objects confirm this\ntrend. If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities\nand assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes\nwould imply a decrease of 0.3% in the current estimate of the local Hubble\nconstant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a\nvalue 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value\ninferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM. We also test\nfor a zeropoint error in Gaia parallaxes and find none to a precision of ~20\nmuas. We caution however that with this early release, the complete systematic\nproperties of the measurements may not be fully understood at the statistical\nlevel of the Cepheid sample mean, a level an order of magnitude below the\nindividual uncertainties. The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the\nenormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions\nin astrophysics and cosmology.\n", "  We present an X-ray photometric analysis of six gravitationally lensed\nquasars, with observation campaigns spanning from 5 to 14 years, measuring the\ntotal (0.83 - 21.8 keV restframe), soft (0.83 - 3.6 keV), and hard (3.6 - 21.8\nkeV) band image flux ratios or each epoch. Using the ratios of the\nmodel-predicted macro-magnifications as baselines, we build differential\nmicrolensing light curves and obtain joint likelihood functions for the average\nX-ray emission region sizes. Our analysis yields a Probability Distribution\nFunction for the average half-light radius of the X-Ray emission region in the\nsample that peaks slightly above 1 gravitational radius and with nearly\nindistinguishable 68% confidence (one-sided) upper limits of 17.8 and 18.9\ngravitational radii for the soft and hard X-ray emitting regions, assuming a\nmean stellar mass of 0.3 solar masses. We see hints of energy dependent\nmicrolensing between the soft and hard bands in two of the objects. In a\nseparate analysis on the root-mean-square of the microlensing variability, we\nfind significant differences between the soft and hard bands but the sign of\nthe difference is not consistent across the sample. This suggests the existence\nof some kind of spatial structure to the X-ray emission in an otherwise\nextremely compact source. We also discover a correlation between the RMS\nmicrolensing variability and the average microlensing amplitude.\n", "  We study particle production at the preheating era in inflation models with\nnonminimal coupling $\\xi \\phi^2R$ and quartic potential $\\lambda \\phi^4/4$ for\nseveral cases: real scalar inflaton, complex scalar inflaton and Abelian Higgs\ninflaton. We point out that the preheating proceeds much more violently than\npreviously thought. If the inflaton is a complex scalar, the phase degree of\nfreedom is violently produced at the first stage of preheating. If the inflaton\nis a Higgs field, the longitudinal gauge boson production is similarly violent.\nThis is caused by a spike-like feature in the time dependence of the inflaton\nfield, which may be understood as a consequence of the short time scale during\nwhich the effective potential or kinetic term changes suddenly. The produced\nparticles typically have very high momenta $k \\lesssim\n\\sqrt{\\lambda}M_\\text{P}$. The production might be so strong that almost all\nthe energy of the inflaton is carried away within one oscillation for\n$\\xi^2\\lambda \\gtrsim {\\mathcal O}(100)$. This may partly change the\nconventional understandings of the (p)reheating after inflation with the\nnonminimal coupling to gravity such as Higgs inflation. We also discuss the\npossibility of unitarity violation at the preheating stage.\n", "  We report on the energy spectrum of electrons in twisted bilayer graphene\n(tBLG) obtained by the band-unfolding method in the tight-binding model. We\nfind the band-gap opening at particular points in the reciprocal space, that\nelucidates the drastic reduction of the Fermi-level velocity with the tiny\ntwisted angles in tBLGs. We find that Moir\\`e pattern caused by the twist of\nthe two graphene layers generates interactions among Dirac cones, otherwise\nabsent, and the resultant cone-cone interactions peculiar to each point in the\nreciprocal space causes the energy gap and thus reduced the Fermi-level\nvelocity.\n", "  We scrutinize the effect of polyvalent ions on polymer-DNA interactions. We\nextend a recently developed test charge theory to the case of a stiff polymer\ninteracting with a DNA molecule in an electrolyte mixture. The theory accounts\nfor one-loop level electrostatic correlation effects such as the ionic cloud\ndeformation around the strongly charged DNA molecule as well as image-charge\nforces induced by the low DNA permittivity. Our model can reproduce and explain\nvarious characteristics of the experimental phase diagrams for polymer\nsolutions. First, the addition of polyvalent cations to the electrolyte\nsolution results in the attraction of the negatively charged polymer by the DNA\nmolecule. The glue of the like-charge attraction is the enhanced shielding of\nthe polymer charges by the dense counterion layer at the DNA surface. Secondly,\nthrough the shielding of the DNA-induced electrostatic potential, mono- and\npolyvalent cations of large concentration both suppress the like-charge\nattraction. Within the same formalism, we also predict a new opposite-charge\nrepulsion effect between the DNA molecule and a positively charged polymer. In\nthe presence of polyvalent anions such as sulfate or phosphate, their repulsion\nby the DNA charges leads to the charge screening deficiency of the region\naround the DNA molecule. This translates into a repulsive force that results in\nthe decomplexation of the polymer from DNA. This opposite-charge repulsion\nphenomenon can be verified by current experiments and the underlying mechanism\ncan be beneficial to gene therapeutic applications where the control over\npolymer-DNA interactions is the key factor.\n", "  Simultaneous description of heavy quark nuclear suppression factor $R_{AA}$\nand the elliptic flow $v_2$ is a top challenge for all the existing models. We\nhighlight how the temperature dependence of the energy loss/transport\ncoefficients is responsible to address a large part of such a puzzle along with\nthe the full solution of the Boltzmann collision integral for the momentum\nevolution of heavy quark. We consider four different models to evaluate the\ntemperature dependence of drag coefficients of the heavy quark in the QGP. We\nhave also highlighted the heavy quark dynamics in the presence of an external\nelectromagnetic field which develops a sizable heavy quark directed flow,\n$v_1(y)$, can be measurable at LHC.\n", "  We study the effect of directional quenching on patterns formed in simple\nbistable systems such as the Allen-Cahn and the Cahn-Hilliard equation on the\nplane. We model directional quenching as an externally triggered change in\nsystem parameters, changing the system from monostable to bistable across an\ninterface. We are then interested in patterns forming in the bistable region,\nin particular as the trigger progresses and increases the bistable region. We\nfind existence and non-existence results of single interfaces and striped\npatterns.\n", "  Although $SO(10)$ Supersymmetric (SUSY) Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) are\nvery attractive for neutrino mass and mixing, it is often quite difficult to\nachieve successful leptogenesis from the lightest right-handed neutrino $N_1$\ndue to the strong relations between neutrino and up-type quark Yukawa\ncouplings. We show that in a realistic model these constraints are relaxed,\nmaking $N_1$ leptogenesis viable. To illustrate this, we calculate the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe $ Y_B $ from flavoured $ N_1 $ leptogenesis in a\nrecently proposed $ \\Delta(27) \\times SO(10) $ SUSY GUT. The flavoured\nBoltzmann equations are solved numerically, and comparison with the observed $\nY_B $ places constraints on the allowed values of right-handed neutrino masses\nand neutrino Yukawa couplings. The flavoured $SO(10)$ SUSY GUT is not only\nfairly complete and predictive in the lepton sector, but can also explain the\nBAU through leptogenesis with natural values in the lepton sector albeit with\nsome tuning in the quark sector.\n", "  A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model has been shown to describe experimental\ndata well, such as the bulk properties of particle spectra and elliptic\nanisotropy ($v_{2}$) in heavy ion collisions. Recent studies have shown that\nAMPT describes the $v_{2}$ data in small system collisions as well. In these\nproceedings, we first investigate the origin of the mass ordering of identified\nhadrons $v_{2}$ in heavy ion as well as small system collisions. We then study\nthe production mechanism of the charm $v_{2}$ in light of the escape mechanism\nfor the light quark $v_{2}$.\n", "  We explore an electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) scenario based on the\nmixture of a fundamental Higgs doublet and an SU(4)/Sp(4) composite\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone doublet -- a particular manifestation of bosonic\ntechnicolor/induced EWSB. Taking the fundamental Higgs mass parameter to be\npositive, EWSB is triggered by the mixing of the doublets. This setup has\nseveral attractive features and phenomenological consequences, which we\nhighlight: i) Unlike traditional bosonic technicolor models, the hierarchy\nbetween $\\Lambda_{\\rm TC}$ and the electroweak scale depends on vacuum\n(mis)alignment and can be sizable, yielding an attractive framework for natural\nEWSB; ii) As the strong sector is based on SU(4)/Sp(4), a fundamental\n(UV-complete) description of the strong sector is possible, that is informed by\nthe lattice; iii) The lightest vector resonances occur in the 10-plet, 5-plet\nand singlet of Sp(4). Misalignment leads to a 10-plet \"parity-doubling\"\ncancelation in the $S$ parameter, and a suppressed 5-plet contribution; iv)\nHiggs coupling deviations are typically of $\\mathcal O(1\\%)$; v) The 10-plet\nisotriplet resonances decay dominantly to a massive technipion and a gauge\nboson, or to technipion pairs, rather than to gauge boson or fermion pairs;\nmoreover, their couplings to fermions are small. Thus, the bounds on this setup\nfrom conventional heavy-vector-triplet searches are weak. A supersymmetric\n$U(1)_R$ symmetric realization is briefly described.\n", "  In this note, we describe supersymmetric backgrounds for the four-dimensional\nmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. As an extension of the method of\nFestuccia and Seiberg to sixteen supercharges in four dimensions, we utilize\nthe coupling of the gauge theory to maximally extended conformal supergravity.\nIncluded among the fields of the conformal supergravity multiplet is the\ncomplexified coupling parameter of the gauge theory; therefore, backgrounds\nwith spacetime varying coupling--such as appear in F-theory and Janus\nconfigurations--are naturally included in this formalism. We demonstrate this\nwith a few examples from past literature.\n", "  A number of searches at the LHC looking for low mass ($2m_{\\mu} - 62\\\n\\mathrm{GeV}$) bosons in $\\sqrt{s} = 8\\ \\mathrm{TeV}$ data have recently been\npublished. We summarise the most pertinent ones, and look at how their limits\naffect a variety of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models which can give\nrise to such light bosons: the 2HDM (Types I and II), the NMSSM, and the nMSSM.\n", "  Recently it has been shown that a realistic description of the medium via\nevent-by-event viscous hydrodynamics plays an important role in the\nlong-standing $R_\\text{AA}$ vs. $v_2$ puzzle at high $p_T$. In this proceedings\nwe begin to extend this approach to the heavy flavor sector by investigating\nthe effects of full event-by-event fluctuating hydrodynamic backgrounds on the\nnuclear suppression factor and $v_2\\{2\\}$ of heavy flavor mesons and\nnon-photonic electrons at intermediate to high $p_T$. We also show results for\n$v_3\\{2\\}$ of $B^0$ and D$^0$ for PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV.\n", "  One of the key signatures of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is the modification\nof hadron transverse momentum differential cross-sections in heavy-ion\ncollisions (HIC) as compared to proton-proton (pp) collisions. Suppression of\nhadron production at high transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm T}$) in HIC has been\nexplained by the energy loss of the partons produced in the hard scattering\nprocesses which traverse the deconfined quantum chromodynamic (QCD) matter. The\ndependence of the observed suppression on the $p_{\\rm T}$ of the measured\nhadron towards higher $p_{\\rm T}$ is an important input for the theoretical\nunderstanding of jet quenching effects in the QGP and the nature of the energy\nloss, while suppression towards lower $p_{\\rm T}$ gives information about\ncollective behaviour. The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nperforms a variety of measurements including the spectra of neutral mesons and\nkaons at mid-rapidity in a wide $p_{\\rm T}$ range in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb\ncollisions. An overview of ALICE results in HIC and pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$2.76 TeV of neutral pions, kaons and eta mesons as a function\nof transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and centrality will be presented. Ratios\n$\\eta$/$\\pi^{0}$, $K^{\\pm}$/$\\pi^{\\pm}$ as well as comparisons to model\ncalculations will also be discussed.\n", "  We measured the ultra-low-temperature specific heat and thermal conductivity\nof Au$_2$Pb single crystal, a possible three-dimensional Dirac semimetal with a\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c \\approx$ 1.05 K. The electronic\nspecific heat can be fitted by a two-band s-wave model, which gives the gap\namplitudes $\\Delta_1$(0)/$k_BT_c$ = 1.38 and $\\Delta_2$(0)/$k_BT_c$ = 5.25.\nFrom the thermal conductivity measurements, a negligible residual linear term\n$\\kappa_0/T$ in zero field and a slow field dependence of $\\kappa_0/T$ at low\nfield are obtained. These results suggest that Au$_2$Pb has a fully gapped\nsuperconducting state in the bulk, which is a necessary condition for\ntopological superconductor if Au$_2$Pb is indeed one.\n", "  We discuss how to perform consistent extractions of anomalous triple gauge\ncouplings (aTGC) from electroweak boson pair production at the LHC in the\nStandard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). After recasting recent ATLAS and\nCMS searches in $pp\\to WZ (WW) \\to \\ell' \\nu \\ell^+\\ell^- (\\nu_{\\ell})$\nchannels, we find that: (a) working consistently at order $\\Lambda^{-2}$ in the\nSMEFT expansion the existing aTGC bounds from Higgs and LEP-2 data are not\nimproved, (b) the strong limits quoted by the experimental collaboration are\ndue to the partial $\\Lambda^{-4}$ corrections (dimension-6 squared\ncontributions). Using helicity selection rule arguments we are able to explain\nthe suppression in some of the interference terms, and discuss conditions on\nNew Physics (NP) models that can benefit from such LHC analyses. Furthermore,\nstandard analyses assume implicitly a quite large NP scale, an assumption that\ncan be relaxed by imposing cuts on the underlying scale of the process\n($\\sqrt{\\hat{s}}$). In practice, we find almost no correlation between\n$\\sqrt{\\hat{s}}$ and the experimentally accessible quantities, which\ncomplicates the SMEFT interpretation. Nevertheless, we provide a method to set\n(conservative) aTGC bounds in this situation, and recast the present searches\naccordingly. Finally, we introduce a simple NP model for aTGC to compare the\nbounds obtained directly in the model with those from the SMEFT analysis.\n", "  Many real-world systems are composed of interdependent networks that rely on\none another. Such networks are typically designed and operated by different\nentities, who aim at maximizing their own payoffs. There exists a game among\nthese entities when designing their own networks. In this paper, we study the\ngame investigating how the rational behaviors of entities impact the system\nrobustness. We first introduce a mathematical model to quantify the interacting\npayoffs among varying entities. Then we study the Nash equilibrium of the game\nand compare it with the optimal social welfare. We reveal that the cooperation\namong different entities can be reached to maximize the social welfare in\ncontinuous game only when the average degree of each network is constant.\nTherefore, the huge gap between Nash equilibrium and optimal social welfare\ngenerally exists. The rationality of entities makes the system inherently\ndeficient and even renders it extremely vulnerable in some cases. We analyze\nour model for two concrete systems with continuous strategy space and discrete\nstrategy space, respectively. Furthermore, we uncover some factors (such as\nweakening coupled strength of interdependent networks, designing suitable\ntopology dependency of the system) that help reduce the gap and the system\nvulnerability.\n", "  The data on the $p_T$ spectra of $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$ at LHC can be presented\nin a format that shows exponential behavior up to $p_T\\approx 6$ GeV/c with the\nsame slope for both particles and for nearly all centralities. They are\nempirical properties that are shared at lower energies with the inverse slope\nshowing a power-law dependence on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The shared properties of the\nspectra are shown to emerge naturally from the recombination model. No flow is\nneeded. We find experimental hints for the possibility that $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$\nare mostly produced in the ridge that are generated by minijets. Appropriate\nexperimental test is suggested.\n", "  We present a practical scheme to separate the contributions of the electric\nquadrupole-like and the magnetic dipole-like effects to the forbidden second\norder optical nonlinear response of graphene, and give analytic expressions for\nthe second order op- tical conductivities, calculated from the independent\nparticle approximation, with relaxation described in a phenomenological way. We\npredict strong second order nonlinear effects, including second harmonic\ngeneration, photon drag, and difference fre- quency generation. We discuss in\ndetail the controllability of these effects by tuning the chemical potential,\ntaking advantage of the dominant role played by interband optical transitions\nin the response.\n", "  Kinematic edges in the invariant mass distributions of different final state\nparticles are typically a signal of new physics. In this work we propose a\nscenario wherein these edges could be utilised in discriminating between\ndifferent classes of models. To this effect, we consider the resonant\nproduction of a heavy Higgs like resonance (H 1 ) as a case study. Such states\nare a characteristic feature of many new physics scenarios beyond the Standard\nModel (SM). In the event of a discovery, it is essential to identify the true\nnature of the underlying theory. In this work we propose a channel, $H_1\n\\rightarrow t_2 t$, where t_2 is a vector-like gauge singlet top-partner that\ndecays into W b, Zt, ht. Invariant mass distributions constructed out of these\nfinal states are characterized by the presence of kinematic edges, which are\nunique to the topology under consideration. Further, since all the final state\nparticles are SM states, the position in the edges of these invariant mass\ndistributions can be used to exclusively determine the masses of the\nresonances. Observation of these features are meant to serve as a trigger,\nthereby mandating a more detailed analysis in a particular direction of\nparameter space. The absence of these edge like features, in the specific\ninvariant mass distributions considered here, in minimal versions of\nsupersymmetric models (MSSM) also serves as a harbinger of such non MSSM-like\nscenarios.\n", "  We present a thorough analysis of a Zeeman slower for sodium atoms made of\npermanent magnets in a Halbach configuration. Due to the orientation of the\nmagnetic field, the polarisation of the slowing laser beam cannot be purely\ncircular leading to optical leakages into dark states. To circumvent this\neffect, we propose an atomic state preparation stage able to significantly\nincrease the performances of the Zeeman slower. After a careful theoretical\nanalysis of the problem, we experimentally implement an optical pumping stage\nleading to an increase of the magneto-optical trap loading rate by 3.5. Such\nmethod is easy to set up and could be extended to other Zeeman slower\narchitectures.\n", "  We present a model study of an alternative implementation of a two-port\nHall-effect microwave gyrator. Our set-up involves three electrodes, one of\nwhich acts as a common ground for the others. Based on the capacitive-coupling\nmodel of Viola and DiVincenzo, we analyze the performance of the device and we\npredict that ideal gyration can be achieved at specific frequencies.\nInterestingly, the impedance of the three-terminal gyrator can be made\narbitrarily small for certain coupling strengths, so that no auxiliary\nimpedance matching is required. Although the bandwidth of the device shrinks as\nthe impedance decreases, it can be improved by reducing the magnetic field; it\ncan be realistically increased up to $ 150 \\mathrm{MHz}$ at $50\\mathrm{\\Omega}$\nby working at filling factor $\\nu=10$. We examine also the effects of the\nparasitic capacitive coupling between electrodes and we find that, although in\ngeneral they strongly influence the response of device, their effect is\nnegligible at low impedance. Finally, we analyze an interferometric\nimplementation of a circulator, which incorporates the gyrator in a\nMach-Zender-like construction. Perfect circulation in both directions can be\nachieved, depending on frequency and on the details of the interferometer.\n", "  I propose the measurement of the $W^\\pm h$ charge asymmetry as a consistency\ntest for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, which is sensitive to enhanced Yukawa\ncouplings of the first and second generation quarks. I present a collider\nanalysis for the charge asymmetry in the same-sign lepton final state, $p p \\to\nW^\\pm h \\to (\\ell^\\pm \\nu) (\\ell^\\pm \\nu jj)$, aimed at discovery significance\nfor the SM $W^\\pm h$ production mode in each charge channel with 300 fb$^{-1}$\nof 14 TeV LHC data. Using this decay mode, I estimate the statistical precision\non the charge asymmetry should reach 0.4\\% with 3 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity,\nenabling a strong consistency test of the SM Higgs hypothesis. I also discuss\ndirect and indirect constraints on light quark Yukawa couplings from direct and\nindirect probes of the Higgs width as well as Tevatron and Large Hadron\nCollider Higgs data. While the main effect from enhanced light quark Yukawa\ncouplings is a rapid increase in the total Higgs width, such effects could be\nmitigated in a global fit to Higgs couplings, leaving the $W^\\pm h$ charge\nasymmetry as a novel signature to test directly the Higgs couplings to light\nquarks.\n", "  The dispersed fluorescence following pulsed dye laser excitation of the\n$\\textrm{B}_2 \\Sigma^+ - \\textrm{X}^2 \\Sigma^+(0,0)$ band of a cold sample of\nSiO$^+$ has been recorded and analyzed. The branching ratios for $\\textrm{B}_2\n\\Sigma^+ (v=0) \\rightarrow \\textrm{X}^2 \\Sigma^+(v)$ and $\\textrm{B}_2 \\Sigma^+\n(v=0) \\rightarrow \\textrm{A}^2 \\Pi_i(v)$ emission were determined and compared\nwith values predicted based upon existing experimental and theoretical data.\nThe experimentally determined branching ratios show that the $\\textrm{B}_2\n\\Sigma^+ (v=0) \\rightarrow \\textrm{X}^2 \\Sigma^+(v)$ transitions are somewhat\nless diagonal than predicted. The implications for laser cooling of a trapped\nsample of SiO$^+$ using broadband laser excitation are discussed.\n", "  We explore numerically the morphological patterns of thermo-diffusive\ninstabilities in combustion fronts with a continuum fuel source, within a range\nof Lewis numbers and ignition temperatures, focusing on the cellular regime.\nFor this purpose, we generalize the model of Brailovsky et al. to include\ndistinct process kinetics and reactant heterogeneity. The generalized model is\nderived analytically and validated with other established models in the limit\nof infinite Lewis number for zero-order and first-order kinetics. Cellular and\ndendritic instabilities are found at low Lewis numbers thanks to a dynamic\nadaptive mesh refinement technique that reduces finite size effects, which can\naffect or even preclude the emergence of these patterns. This technique also\nallows achieving very large computational domains, enabling the study of\nsystem-size effects. Our numerical linear stability analysis is consistent with\nthe analytical results of Brailovsky et al. The distinct types of dynamics\nfound in the vicinity of the critical Lewis number, ranging from steady-state\ncells to continued tip-splitting and cell-merging, are well described within\nthe framework of thermo-diffusive instabilities and are consistent with\nprevious numerical studies. These types of dynamics are classified as\n\"quasi-linear\" and characterized by low amplitude cells and may follow the mode\nselection mechanism and growth prescribed by the linear theory. Below this\nrange of Lewis number, highly non-linear effects become prominent and large\namplitude, complex cellular and {\\it{seaweed}} dendritic morphologies emerge.\n", "  The production of charmonium states, J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S), in heavy-ion\ncollisions, is an important probe to investigate the formation of a plasma of\nquarks and gluons (QGP). In a hot and deconfined medium, quarkonium production\nis, indeed, expected to be significantly modified, with respect to the pp\nyields, due to a balance of color screening and charm-quark recombination\nmechanisms. The ALICE Collaboration at the LHC has measured charmonium\nproduction in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} =$ 2.76 and 5.02 TeV. The\nnuclear modification factor of inclusive J/$\\psi$, evaluated at forward\n($-4<\\eta<-2.5$) rapidity, is measured as a function of the centrality of the\ncollision and of the J/$\\psi$ kinematic variables as transverse momentum and\nrapidity. In this article, we report on the new J/$\\psi$ results, obtained at\nforward rapidity, at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV. These new results are\ncompared to the J/$\\psi$ nuclear modification factor obtained at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm\nNN} =$ 2.76 TeV and to the available theoretical predictions.\n", "  The main goal of the ALICE experiment is to study the properties of the hot\nand dense medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The\nmeasurement of the (multi-)strange particles is an important tool to understand\nparticle production mechanisms and the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP). We report on the production of K$^{0}_{S}$,\n$\\Lambda$($\\overline{\\Lambda}$), $\\Xi^{-}$($\\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$) and\n$\\Omega^{-}$($\\overline{\\Omega}^{+}$) in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. The comparison of\nthe hyperon-to-pion ratios in the two colliding systems may provide insight\ninto strangeness production mechanisms, while the comparison of the nuclear\nmodification factors helps to determine the contribution of initial state\neffects and the suppression from strange quark energy loss in nuclear matter.\n", "  We analyze some basic issues associated with Generalized Poisson-Kac (GPK)\nstochastic processes, starting from the extended notion of the Markovian\ncondition. The extended Markovian nature of GPK processes is established, and\nthe implications of this property derived: the associated adjoint formalism for\nGPK processes is developed essentially in an analogous way as for the\nFokker-Planck operator associated with Langevin equations driven by Wiener\nprocesses. Subsequently, the regularity of trajectories is addressed: the\noccurrence of fractality in the realizations of GPK is a long-term emergent\nproperty, and its implication in thermodynamics is discussed. The concept of\ncompleteness in the stochastic description of GPK is also introduced. Finally,\nsome observations on the role of correlation properties of noise sources and\ntheir influence on the dynamic properties of transport phenomena are addressed,\nusing a Wiener model for comparison.\n", "  Presented in this paper are measurements of an optomechanical device in which\nvarious acoustic modes of a sample of superfluid helium couple to a fiber-based\noptical cavity. In contrast with recent work on the paraxial acoustic mode\nconfined by the cavity mirrors, we focus specifically on the acoustic modes\nassociated with the helium surrounding the cavity. This paper provides a\nframework for understanding how the acoustic modes depend on device geometry.\nThe acoustic modes are observed using the technique of optomechanically induced\ntransparency/amplification. The optomechanical coupling to these modes is found\nto be predominantly photothermal.\n", "  We review efforts to describe the approach to chiral symmetry restoration in\nneutron matter from the low-energy realization of QCD, chiral effective field\ntheory.\n", "  The rate at which matter flows into a galactic nucleus during early phases of\ngalaxy evolution can sometimes exceed the Eddington limit of the growing\ncentral black hole by several orders of magnitude. We discuss the necessary\nconditions for the black hole to actually accrete this matter at such a high\nrate, and consider the observational appearance and detectability of a\nhyperaccreting black hole. In order to be accreted at a hyper-Eddington rate,\nthe infalling gas must have a sufficiently low angular momentum. Although most\nof the gas is accreted, a significant fraction accumulates in an optically\nthick envelope with luminosity $\\sim L_{\\rm Edd}$, probably pierced by jets of\nmuch higher power. If $\\dot M > 10^3 \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$, the envelope spectrum\nresembles a blackbody with a temperature of a few thousand K, but for lower\n(but still hyper-Eddington) accretion rates the spectrum becomes a very dilute\nand hard Wien spectrum. We consider the likelihood of various regimes of\nhyperaccretion, and discuss its possible observational signatures.\n", "  Density functional theory paired with a first order many-body perturbation\ntheory correction is applied to determine formation energies and charge\ntransition energies for point defects in bulk In_0.53Ga_0.47As and for models\nof the In_0.53Ga_0.47As/Al_2O_3 interface. The results are consistent with\nprevious computational studies that As_Ga antisites are candidates for defects\nobserved in capacitance voltage measurements on metal-oxide-semiconductor\ncapacitors, as the As_Ga antisite introduces energy states near the valence\nband maximum and near the middle of the energy band gap. However, substantial\nbroadening in the distribution of the Ga_As charge transition levels due to the\nvariation in the local chemical environment resulting from alloying on the\ncation (In/Ga) sublattice is found, whereas this effect is absent for As_Ga\nantisites. Also, charge transition energy levels are found to vary based on\nproximity to the semiconductor/oxide interface. The combined effects of alloy-\nand proximity-shift on the Ga_As antisite charge transition energies are\nconsistent with the distribution of interface defect levels between the valence\nband edge and midgap as extracted from electrical characterization data. Hence,\nkinetic growth conditions leading to a high density of either Ga_As or As_Ga\nantisites near the In_0.53Ga_0.47As/Al_2O_3 interface are both consistent with\ndefect energy levels at or below midgap.\n", "  We study the effects produced by sterile Majorana neutrinos on the\n$\\nu_{\\tau}$ flux traversing the Earth, considering the interaction between the\nMajorana neutrinos and the standard matter as modeled by an effective theory.\nThe surviving tau-neutrino flux is calculated using transport equations\nincluding Majorana neutrino production and decay. We compare our results with\nthe pure Standard Model interactions, computing the surviving flux for\ndifferent values of the effective lagrangian couplings, considering the\ndetected flux by IceCube for an operation time of ten years, and Majorana\nneutrinos with mass $m_N \\thicksim m_{\\tau}$.\n", "  We develop a novel field effect transistor (FET) device using solid ion\nconductor (SIC) as a gate dielectric, and we can tune the carrier density of\nFeSe by driving lithium ions in and out of the FeSe thin flakes, and\nconsequently control the material properties and its phase transitions. A\ndome-shaped superconducting phase diagram was mapped out with increasing Li\ncontent, with $T_c$ $\\sim$ 46.6 K for the optimal doping, and an insulating\nphase was reached at the extremely overdoped regime. Our study suggests that,\nusing solid ion conductor as a gate dielectric, the SIC-FET device can achieve\nmuch higher carrier doping in the bulk, and suit many surface sensitive\nexperimental probes, and can stabilize novel structural phases that are\ninaccessible in ordinary conditions.\n", "  We study the compositeness of near-threshold states to clarify the internal\nstructure of exotic hadron candidates. Within the framework of effective field\ntheory, we extend the Weinberg's weak-binding relation to include the nearby\nCDD (Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson) pole contribution with the help of the Pade\napproximant. Finally, using the extended relation, we conclude that the CDD\npole contribution to the Lambda(1405) baryon in the Kbar N amplitude is\nnegligible.\n", "  We have demonstrated that a supersonic beam of methyl radicals (CH$_3$) in\nthe ground rotational state of both $para$ and $ortho$ species has been slowed\ndown to standstill with a magnetic molecular decelerator, and successfully\ncaptured spatially in an anti-Helmholtz magnetic trap for $>$ 1 s. The trapped\nCH$_3$ radicals have a mean translational temperature of about 200 mK with an\nestimated density of $>5.0\\times10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. The methyl radical is an ideal\nsystem for the study of cold molecules not only because of its high\nreactivities at low temperatures, but also because further cooling below 1 mK\nis plausible via sympathetic cooling with ultracold atoms. The demonstrated\ntrapping capability of methyl radicals opens up various possibilities for\nrealizing ultracold ensembles of molecules towards Bose-Einstein condensation\nof polyatomic molecules and investigations of reactions governed by quantum\nstatistics.\n", "  We address the issue of the infinite ambiguity that affects the construction\nof a Fock quantization of a Dirac field propagating in a cosmological spacetime\nwith flat compact sections. In particular, we discuss a physical criterion that\nrestricts to a unique possibility (up to unitary equivalence) the infinite set\nof available vacua. We prove that this desired uniqueness is guaranteed, for\nany possible choice of spin structure on the spatial sections, if we impose two\nconditions. The first one is that the symmetries of the classical system must\nbe implemented quantum mechanically, so that the vacuum is invariant under the\nsymmetry transformations. The second and more important condition is that the\nconstructed theory must have a quantum dynamics that is implementable as a\n(non-trivial) unitary operator in Fock space. Actually, this unitarity of the\nquantum dynamics leads us to identify as explicitly time dependent some very\nspecific contributions of the Dirac field. In doing that, we essentially\ncharacterize the part of the dynamics governed by the Dirac equation that is\nunitarily implementable. The uniqueness of the Fock vacuum is attained then\nonce a physically motivated convention for the concepts of particles and\nantiparticles is fixed.\n", "  We demonstrate single photon emission from self-assembled m-plane InGaN\nquantum dots (QDs) embedded on the side-walls of GaN nanowires. A combination\nof electron microscopy, cathodoluminescence, time-resolved micro-PL and photon\nautocorrelation experiments give a thorough evaluation of the QDs structural\nand optical properties. The QD exhibits anti-bunched emission up to 100 K, with\na measured autocorrelation function of g^2(0) = 0.28 (0.03) at 5 K. Studies on\na statistically significant number of QDs show that these m-plane QDs exhibit\nvery fast radiative lifetimes (260 +/- 55 ps) suggesting smaller internal\nfields than any of the previously reported c-plane and a-plane QDs. Moreover,\nthe observed single photons are almost completely linearly polarized aligned\nperpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis with a degree of linear\npolarization of 0.84 +/- 0.12. Such InGaN QDs incorporated in a nanowire system\nmeet many of the requirements for implementation into quantum information\nsystems and could potentially open the door to wholly new device concepts.\n", "  We consider mixed branches of 3d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ $T[SU(N)]$ theory. We\ncompute the Hilbert series of the Coulomb branch part of the mixed branch from\na restriction rule acting on the Hilbert series of the full Coulomb branch that\nwill truncate the magnetic charge summation only to the subset of BPS dressed\nmonopole operators that arise in the Coulomb branch sublocus where the mixed\nbranch stems. This restriction can be understood directly from the type IIB\nbrane picture by a relation between the magnetic charges of the monopoles and\nbrane position moduli. We also apply the restriction rule to the Higgs branch\npart of a given mixed branch by exploiting 3d mirror symmetry. Both cases show\ncomplete agreement with the results calculated by different methods.\n", "  We show that ac driven skyrmions interacting with an asymmetric substrate\nprovide a realization of a new class of ratchet system which we call a vector\nratchet that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion\ndynamics. In a vector ratchet, the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be\ndescribed as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise\nrelative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full $360^{\\circ}$\nrotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In\ncontrast to overdamped systems, in which ratchet motion is always parallel to\nthe substrate asymmetry direction, vector ratchets allow the ratchet motion to\nbe in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to\nobtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector ratchet,\npermitting the creation of a reversible vector ratchet. We examine vector\nratchets for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate\nasymmetry direction, and show that reverse ratchet motion can be produced by\ncollective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an\nasymmetric substrate. Since a vector ratchet can produce motion in any\ndirection, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for\nspintronic applications.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the atom optics kicked particle at quantum\nresonance using finite duration kicks. Even though the underlying process is\nquantum interference it can be well described by an $\\epsilon$-pseudoclassical\nmodel. The $\\epsilon$-pseudoclassical model agrees well with our experiments\nfor a wide range of parameters. We investigate the parameters yielding maximal\nmomentum transfer to the atoms and find that this occurs in the regime where\nneither the short pulse approximation nor the Bragg condition is valid.\nNonetheless, the momentum transferred to the atoms can be predicted using a\nsimple scaling law, which provides a powerful tool for choosing optimal\nexperimental parameters. We demonstrate this in a measurement of the Talbot\ntime (from which $h/M$ can be deduced), in which we coherently split atomic\nwave-functions into superpositions of momentum states that differ by 200 photon\nrecoils. Our work may provide a convenient way to implement large momentum\ndifference beam splitters in atom interferometers.\n", "  Thanks to its excellent tracking and particle identification performance, the\nALICE detector is capable of measuring D mesons at central rapidity via their\nhadronic decay channels down to very low transverse momentum. We show an\nextension of the prompt ${\\rm D}^0$ $p_{\\rm T}$-differential cross section\nmeasurement down to zero transverse momentum, which allows us to determine the\n$p_{\\rm T}$-integrated charm production cross section at central rapidity in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. We also present measurements of azimuthal\ncorrelations of prompt ${\\rm D}^0$, ${\\rm D}^+$ and ${\\rm D}^{*+}$ mesons with\ncharged hadrons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and compare the results with\nexpectations from models.\n", "  An electromagnetic theory of thermal radiation is outlined, based on the\nfluctuation electrodynamics of Rytov and co-workers. We discuss the basic\nconcepts and the status of different approximations. The physical content is\nillustrated with a few examples on near-field heat transfer.\n", "  If leptonic unitarity is violated by new physics at an energy scale much\nlower than the electroweak scale, which we call low-scale unitarity violation,\nit has different characteristic features from those expected in unitarity\nviolation at high-energy scales. They include maintaining flavor universality\nand absence of zero-distance flavor transition. We present a framework for\ntesting such unitarity violation at low energies by neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. Starting from the unitary 3 active plus $N$ (arbitrary integer)\nsterile neutrino model we show that by restricting the active-sterile and\nsterile-sterile neutrino mass squared differences to $\\gtrsim$ 0.1 eV$^2$ the\noscillation probability in the $(3+N)$ model becomes insensitive to details of\nthe sterile sector, providing a nearly model-independent framework for testing\nlow-scale unitarity violation. Yet, the presence of the sterile sector leaves\ntrace as a constant probability leaking term, which distinguishes low-scale\nunitarity violation from the high-scale one. The non-unitary mixing matrix in\nthe active neutrino subspace is common for the both cases. We analyze how\nseverely the unitarity violation can be constrained in $\\nu_{e}$-row by taking\na JUNO-like setting to simulate medium baseline reactor experiments. Possible\nmodification of the features of the $(3+N)$ model due to matter effect is\ndiscussed to first order in the matter potential.\n", "  We show a phase-locked array of three quantum cascade lasers with an\nintegrated Talbot cavity at one side of the laser array. The coupling scheme is\ncalled diffraction coupling. By controlling the length of Talbot to be a\nquarter of Talbot distance (Zt/4), in-phase mode operation can be selected. The\nin-phase operation shows great modal stability under different injection\ncurrents, from the threshold current to the full power current. The far-field\nradiation pattern of the in-phase operation contains three lobes, one central\nmaximum lobe and two side lobes. The interval between adjacent lobes is about\n10.5{\\deg}. The output power is about 1.5 times that of a single-ridge laser.\nFurther studies should be taken to achieve better beam performance and reduce\noptical losses brought by the integrated Talbot cavity.\n", "  We apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal and internal coordinate or\nmixing time and internal coordinate to a stack of N black M-branes to find the\nMelvin spacetime of a stack of N black D-branes with magnetic or electric flux\nin string theory, after the Kaluza-Klein reduction. We slightly extend previous\nformulas to investigate the external magnetic and electric effects on the\nbutterfly effect and holographic mutual information. It shows that the Melvin\nfields do not modify the scrambling time and will enhance the mutual\ninformation. In addition, we also T-dualize and twist a stack of N black\nD-branes to find a Melvin Universe supported by the flux of the NSNS b-field,\nwhich describes a non-comutative spacetime. It also shows that the spatial\nnoncommutativity does not modify the scrambling time and will enhance the\nmutual information. We also study the corrected mutual information in the\nbackreaction geometry due to the shock wave in our three model spacetimes.\n", "  The influence of the crystallographic orientation of a typical metal surface,\nlike aluminum, on electron emission spectra produced by grazing incidence of\nultrashort laser pulses is investigated by using the\nband-structure-based-Volkov (BSB-V) approximation. The present version of the\nBSB-V approach includes not only a realistic description of the surface\ninteraction, accounting for band structure effects, but also effects due to the\ninduced potential that originates from the collective response of valence-band\nelectrons to the external electromagnetic field. The model is applied to\nevaluate differential electron emission probabilities from the valence band of\nAl(100) and Al(111). For both crystallographic orientations, the contribution\nof partially occupied surface electronic states and the influence of the\ninduced potential are separately analyzed as a function of the laser carrier\nfrequency. We found that the induced potential strongly affects photoelectron\nemission distributions, opening a window to scrutinize band structure effects.\n", "  The flow shear associated with the differential toroidal rotation of tokamak\nplasmas breaks an underlying symmetry of the turbulent fluctuations imposed by\nthe up-down symmetry of the magnetic equilibrium. Using experimental\nBeam-Emission-Spectroscopy (BES) measurements and gyrokinetic simulations, this\nsymmetry breaking in ion-scale turbulence in MAST is shown to manifest itself\nas a tilt of the spatial correlation function and a finite skew in the\ndistribution of the fluctuating density field. The tilt is a statistical\nexpression of the \"shearing\" of the turbulent structures by the mean flow. The\nskewness of the distribution is related to the emergence of long-lived density\nstructures in sheared, near-marginal plasma turbulence. The extent to which\nthese effects are pronounced is argued (with the aid of the simulations) to\ndepend on the distance from the nonlinear stability threshold. Away from the\nthreshold, the symmetry is effectively restored.\n", "  The proton and neutron properties in a uniform magnetic field are\ninvestigated. The Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula is shown to be satisfied for\nbaryon states. It is found that with increasing magnetic field strength, the\nproton mass first decreases and then increases, while the neutron mass always\nincreases. The ratio between magnetic moment of proton and neutron increases\nwith the increase of the magnetic field strength. With increasing magnetic\nfield strength, the size of proton first increases and then decreases, while\nthe size of neutron always decreases. The present analyse implies that in the\ncore part of the magnetar, the equation of state depend on the magnetic field,\nwhich modifies the mass limit of the magnetar.\n", "  We examine the feasibility of detecting auroral emission from the potentially\nhabitable exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. Detection of aurorae would yield an\nindependent confirmation of the planet's existence, constrain the presence and\ncomposition of its atmosphere, and determine the planet's eccentricity and\ninclination, thereby breaking the mass-inclination degeneracy. If Proxima\nCentauri b is a terrestrial world with an Earth-like atmosphere and magnetic\nfield, we estimate the power at the 5577\\AA\\ OI auroral line is on the order of\n0.1 TW under steady-state stellar wind, or ${\\sim} 100 {\\times}$ stronger than\nthat on Earth. This corresponds to a planet-star contrast ratio of\n$10^{-6}-10^{-7}$ in a narrow band about the 5577\\AA\\ line, although higher\ncontrast ($10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) may be possible during periods of strong\nmagnetospheric disturbance (auroral power $1-10$ TW). We searched the Proxima\nCentauri b HARPS data for the 5577\\AA\\ line and for other prominent oxygen and\nnitrogen lines, but find no signal, indicating that the OI auroral line\ncontrast must be lower than $2\\times 10^{-2}$ (with power $\\lesssim$ 3,000 TW),\nconsistent with our predictions. We find that observations of 0.1 TW auroral\nemission lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes.\nHowever, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope or a\nground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph could push\nsensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast $7\\times 10^{-6}$) with\nexposure times of ${\\sim} 1$ day. If a coronagraph design contrast of $10^{-7}$\ncan be achieved with negligible instrumental noise, a future concept ELT could\nobserve steady-state auroral emission in a few nights.\n", "  We present a semiclassical prediction of regular-to-chaotic tunneling in\nsystems with a mixed phase space, including the effect of a nonlinear resonance\nchain. We identify complex paths for direct and resonance-assisted tunneling in\nthe phase space of an integrable approximation with one nonlinear resonance\nchain. We evaluate the resonance-assisted contribution analytically and give a\nprediction based on just a few properties of the classical phase space. For the\nstandard map excellent agreement with numerically determined tunneling rates is\nobserved. The results should similarly apply to ionization rates and quality\nfactors.\n", "  The F3 main sequence star KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's Star) showed deep (up to\n20%) day-long brightness dips of unknown cause during the 4 years of the Kepler\nmission. A 0.164 mag (16%) dimming between 1890 and 1990 was claimed, based on\nthe analysis of photographic plates from the Harvard Observatory. We have\ngathered an independent set of historic plates from Sonneberg Observatory,\nGermany, covering the years 1934-1995. With 861 magnitudes in B, and 397\nmagnitudes in V, we find the star to be of constant brightness within 0.03 mag\nper century (3%). Consistent outcomes are found using by-eye estimates of the\nbest 119 plates. Results are supported by data from Sternberg Observatory,\nMoscow, which show the star as constant between 1895 and 1995. The previously\nclaimed century-long dimming is inconsistent with our results at the 5-sigma\nlevel, however the recently reported modest dimming of 3% in the Kepler data is\nnot inconsistent with our data. We find no periodicities or shorter trends\nwithin our limits of 5% per 5-year bin, but note a possible dimming event on 24\nOct 1978.\n", "  Social behaviors involving the interaction of multiple individuals are\ncomplex and frequently crucial for an animal's survival. These interactions,\nranging across sensory modalities, length scales, and time scales, are often\nsubtle and difficult to quantify. Contextual effects on the frequency of\nbehaviors become even more difficult to quantify when physical interaction\nbetween animals interferes with conventional data analysis, e.g. due to visual\nocclusion. We introduce a method for quantifying behavior in courting fruit\nflies that combines high-throughput video acquisition and tracking of\nindividuals with recent unsupervised methods for capturing an animal's entire\nbehavioral repertoire. We find behavioral differences in paired and solitary\nflies of both sexes, identifying specific behaviors that are affected by social\nand spatial context. Our pipeline allows for a comprehensive description of the\ninteraction between multiple individuals using unsupervised machine learning\nmethods, and will be used to answer questions about the depth of complexity and\nvariance in fruit fly courtship.\n", "  We calculate the structure and evolution of a gamma ray burst central engine\nwhere an accreting torus has formed around the newly born black hole. We study\nthe general relativistic,MHD models and we self-consistently incorporate the\nnuclear equation of state. The latter accounts for the degeneracy of\nrelativistic electrons, protons, and neutrons, and is used in the dynamical\nsimulation, instead of a standard polytropic -law. The EOS provides the\nconditions for the nuclear pressure in the function of density and temperature,\nwhich evolve with time according to the conservative MHD scheme. We analyze the\nstructure of the torus and outflowing winds, and compute the neutrino flux\nemitted through the nuclear reactions balance in the dense and hot matter. We\nalso estimate the rate of transfer of the black hole rotational energy to the\nbipolar jets. Finally, we elaborate on the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in\nthe accretion flow and the wind, through computations of the thermonuclear\nreaction network. We discuss the possible signatures of the radioactive\nelements decay in the accretion flow. We suggest that further detailed modeling\nof the accretion flow in GRB engine, together with its microphysics, may be a\nvaluable tool to constrain the black hole mass and spin. It can be\ncomplementary to the gravitational wave analysis, if the waves are detected\nwith an electromagnetic counterpart.\n", "  Nuclear production experiments report missing absorption processes of the\nin-medium phi meson. Contributions arising from the K-bar K cloud have already\nbeen widely studied, and therefore we investigate the phi-meson properties in\ncold nuclear matter with the additional inclusion of resonant phi N\ninteractions. Two models are considered which dynamically generate N*-like\nstates close to the phi N threshold. We find that these states, together with\nthe non-resonant part of the amplitude, contribute to the phi self-energy with\nthe same order of magnitude as the K-bar K effects. At non-vanishing nuclear\ndensity, both models lead to an additional in-medium broadening of the phi, up\nto around 50 MeV. Furthermore, at least one of the models is compatible with a\nmass shift to lower energies of up to 35 MeV at threshold and normal matter\ndensity. Finally, a double-peak structure appears in the spectral function due\nto the mixing of resonance-hole modes with the $\\phi$ quasi-particle peak.\nThese results converge into the direction of the experimental findings.\n", "  We compute the cross section for photons emitted from sea quarks in\nproton-nucleus collisions at collider energies. The computation is performed\nwithin the dilute-dense kinematics of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC)\neffective field theory. Albeit the result obtained is formally at\nnext-to-leading order in the CGC power counting, it provides the dominant\ncontribution for central rapidities. We observe that the inclusive photon cross\nsection is proportional to all-twist Wilson line correlators in the nucleus.\nThese correlators also appear in quark-pair production; unlike the latter,\nphoton production is insensitive to hadronization uncertainties and therefore\nmore sensitive to multi-parton correlations in the gluon saturation regime of\nQCD. We demonstrate that $k_\\perp$ and collinear factorized expressions for\ninclusive photon production are obtained as leading twist approximations to our\nresult. In particular, the collinearly factorized expression is directly\nsensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution at small $x$. Other results of\ninterest include the realization of the Low-Burnett-Kroll soft photon theorem\nin the CGC framework and a comparative study of how the photon amplitude is\nobtained in Lorenz and light-cone gauges.\n", "  We present a promising new technique, the g-distribution method, for\nmeasuring the inclination angle (i), the innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO), and the spin of a supermassive black hole. The g-distribution method\nuses measurements of the energy shifts in the relativistic iron line emitted by\nthe accretion disk of a supermassive black hole due to microlensing by stars in\na foreground galaxy relative to the g-distribution shifts predicted from\nmicrolensing caustic calculations. We apply the method to the gravitationally\nlensed quasars RX J1131-1231 (z_s=0.658, z_l=0.295), QJ 0158-4325 (z_s=1.294,\nz_l=0.317), and SDSS 1004+4112 (z_s=1.734, z_l=0.68). For RX J1131-1231 our\ninitial results indicate that r_ISCO<8.5 gravitational radii (r_g) and i > 76\ndegrees. We detect two shifted Fe lines, in several observations, as predicted\nin our numerical simulations of caustic crossings. The current\nDeltaE-distribution of RX J1131-1231 is sparsely sampled but further X-ray\nmonitoring of RX J1131-1231 and other lensed quasars will provide improved\nconstraints on the inclination angles, ISCO radii and spins of the black holes\nof distant quasars.\n", "  For a general two-body bound state in quantum mechanics, both in the stable\nand decaying cases, we establish a way to extract its two-body wave function in\nmomentum space from the scattering amplitude of the constituent two particles.\nFor this purpose, we first show that the two-body wave function of the bound\nstate corresponds to the residue of the off-shell scattering amplitude at the\nbound state pole. Then, we examine our scheme to extract the two-body wave\nfunction from the scattering amplitude in several schematic models. As a\nresult, the two-body wave functions from the Lippmann--Schwinger equation\ncoincides with that from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for an energy-independent\ninteraction. Of special interest is that the two-body wave function from the\nscattering amplitude is automatically scaled; the norm of the two-body wave\nfunction, to which we refer as the compositeness, is unity for an\nenergy-independent interaction, while the compositeness deviates from unity for\nan energy-dependent interaction, which can be interpreted to implement missing\nchannel contributions. We also discuss general properties of the two-body wave\nfunction and compositeness for bound states in the schematic models.\n", "  We compute the electric dipole moment of nucleons in the large $N_c$ QCD\nmodel by Witten, Sakai and Sugimoto with $N_f=2$ degenerate massive flavors.\nBaryons in the model are instantonic solitons of an effective five-dimensional\naction describing the whole tower of mesonic fields. We find that the dipole\nelectromagnetic form factor of the nucleons, induced by a finite topological\n$\\theta$ angle, exhibits complete vector meson dominance. We are able to\nevaluate the contribution of each vector meson to the final result - a small\nnumber of modes are relevant to obtain an accurate estimate. Extrapolating the\nmodel parameters to real QCD data, the neutron electric dipole moment is\nevaluated to be $d_n = 1.8 \\cdot 10^{-16}\\, \\theta\\;e\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}$. The\nelectric dipole moment of the proton is exactly the opposite.\n", "  A Raman spectroscopy study was carried out for ZnGeN2 with direction of\npropagation along the (0001) crystallographic direction on hexagonal single\ncrystal platelets obtained by reaction of gaseous ammonia with a Zn-Ge-Sn\nliquid alloy at 758 degree C. The sample geometry allowed measurement of the a2\nand a1 Raman modes. First-principles calculations were carried out of the\nspectra. Measurements with crossed polarizers yielded spectra that agreed well\nwith first-principles calculations of the a2 modes. Measurements with parallel\npolarizers should in principle provide the a1L modes. However, for most of the\nRaman modes, the LO-TO splitting was calculated to be very small, and for the\nfew modes which were predicted to have larger LO-TO splittings, the LO mode was\nnot observed. This absence is tentatively explained in terms of overdamped\nLO-plasmon coupling. LO-TO mode crossing was identified by comparing the\ncalculated eigenvectors and intensities of individual modes. Some features in\nthe experimental spectra were identified as arising from critical points in the\nphonon density of states and are indicative of the degree of disorder on the\ncation lattice.\n", "  We propose that topological spin currents flowing in topologically\nnon-trivial magnetic textures, such as magnetic skyrmions and vortices, produce\nan intrinsic non-adiabatic torque of the form ${\\bf T}_t\\sim [(\\partial_x{\\bf\nm}\\times\\partial_y{\\bf m})\\cdot{\\bf m}]\\partial_y{\\bf m}$. We show that this\ntorque, which is absent in one-dimensional domain walls and/or non-topological\ntextures, is responsible for the enhanced non-adiabaticity parameter observed\nin magnetic vortices compared to one-dimensional textures. The impact of this\ntorque on the motion of magnetic skyrmions is expected to be crucial,\nespecially to determine their robustness against defects and pinning centers.\n", "  In this work, we show that the application of a sol-gel coating renders a\nmicrobubble whispering gallery resonator into an active device. During the\nfabrication of the resonator, a thin layer of erbium-doped sol-gel is applied\nto a tapered microcapillary, then a microbubble with a wall thickness of 1.3\n$\\mu$m is formed with the rare earth diffused into its walls. The doped\nmicrobubble is pumped at 980 nm and lasing in the emission band of the\nEr$^{3+}$ ions with a wavelength of 1535 nm is observed. The laser wavelength\ncan be tuned by aerostatic pressure tuning of the whispering gallery modes of\nthe microbubble. Up to 240 pm tuning is observed with 2 bar of applied\npressure. It is shown that the doped microbubble could be used as a compact,\ntunable laser source. The lasing microbubble can also be used to improve\nsensing capabilities in optofluidic sensing applications.\n", "  We investigate long-range chiral magnetic interactions among adatoms mediated\nby surface states spin-splitted by spin-orbit coupling. Using the Rashba model,\nthe tensor of exchange interactions is extracted wherein a pseudo-dipolar\ninteraction is found besides the usual isotropic exchange interaction and the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that, despite the latter\ninteraction, collinear magnetic states can still be stabilized by the\npseudo-dipolar interaction. The inter-adatom distance controls the strength of\nthese terms, which we exploit to design chiral magnetism in Fe nanostructures\ndeposited on Au(111) surface. We demonstrate that these magnetic interactions\nare related to superpositions of the out-of-plane and in-plane components of\nthe skyrmionic magnetic waves induced by the adatoms in the surrounding\nelectron gas. We show that, even if the inter-atomic distance is large, the\nsize and shape of the nanostructures dramatically impacts on the strength of\nthe magnetic interactions, thereby affecting the magnetic ground state. We also\nderive an appealing connection between the isotropic exchange interaction and\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which relates the latter to the first\norder change of the former with respect to the spin-orbit coupling. This\nimplies that the chirality defined by the direction of the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector is driven by the variation of the isotropic\nexchange interaction due to the spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  We present a calculation of the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections\nto the hadroproduction process $gg\\to ZZ \\to e^+e^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, matched to\nthe parton shower in the POWHEG framework. We take advantage of the POWHEG BOX\ntool for the implementation and rely on PYTHIA 8 for the showering and\nhadronization stages. We fully include $\\gamma^*/Z$ interference effects, while\nalso covering the single-resonant region. For this phenomenological study we\nfocus on four lepton production as a signal process, neglecting all quark mass\neffects as well as the Higgs-mediated contributions, which are known to be\nsubdominant in this case. We provide predictions from our simulations for the\n13 TeV LHC Run II setup, including realistic experimental cuts.\n", "  High-harmonic generation (HHG) in condensed-matter systems is both a source\nof fundamental insight into quantum electron motion and a promising candidate\nto realize compact ultraviolet and ultrafast light sources. Here we argue that\nthe large light intensity required for this phenomenon to occur can be reached\nby exploiting localized plasmons in conducting nanostructures. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that doped graphene nanostructures combine a strong plasmonic\nnear-field enhancement and a pronounced intrinsic nonlinearity that result in\nefficient broadband HHG within a single material platform. We extract this\nconclusion from time-domain simulations using two complementary nonperturbative\napproaches based on atomistic one-electron density-matrix and massless\nDirac-fermion Bloch-equation pictures. High harmonics are predicted to be\nemitted with unprecedentedly large intensity by tuning the incident light to\nthe localized plasmons of ribbons and finite islands. In contrast to atomic\nsystems, we observe no cutoff in harmonic order. Our results support the strong\npotential of nanostructured graphene as a robust, electrically tunable platform\nfor HHG.\n", "  The bulk of the rare earth elements are believed to be synthesized in the\nrapid neutron capture process or $r$ process of nucleosynthesis. The solar\n$r$-process residuals show a small peak in the rare earths around $A\\sim 160$,\nwhich is proposed to be formed dynamically during the end phase of the $r$\nprocess by a pileup of material. This abundance feature is of particular\nimportance as it is sensitive to both the nuclear physics inputs and the\nastrophysical conditions of the main $r$ process. We explore the formation of\nthe rare earth peak from the perspective of an inverse problem, using Monte\nCarlo studies of nuclear masses to investigate the unknown nuclear properties\nrequired to best match rare earth abundance sector of the solar isotopic\nresiduals. When nuclear masses are changed, we recalculate the relevant\n$\\beta$-decay properties and neutron capture rates in the rare earth region.\nThe feedback provided by this observational constraint allows for the reverse\nengineering of nuclear properties far from stability where no experimental\ninformation exists. We investigate a range of astrophysical conditions with\nthis method and show how these lead to different predictions in the nuclear\nproperties influential to the formation of the rare earth peak. We conclude\nthat targeted experimental campaigns in this region will help to resolve the\ntype of conditions responsible for the production of the rare earth nuclei, and\nwill provide new insights into the longstanding problem of the astrophysical\nsite(s) of the $r$ process.\n", "  We present a technique for separating nuclear double beta decay\n($\\beta\\beta$-decay) events from background neutrino interactions due to\n$^{8}$B decays in the sun. This background becomes dominant in a kiloton-scale\nliquid-scintillator detector deep underground and is usually considered as\nirreducible due to an overlap in deposited energy with the signal. However,\nelectrons from 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay often exceed the Cherenkov threshold in\nliquid scintillator, producing photons that are prompt and correlated in\ndirection with the initial electron direction. The use of large-area fast\nphotodetectors allows some separation of these prompt photons from delayed\nisotropic scintillation light and, thus, the possibility of reconstructing the\nevent topology. Using a simulation of a 6.5~m radius liquid scintillator\ndetector with 100~ps resolution photodetectors, we show that a spherical\nharmonics analysis of early-arrival light can discriminate between\n0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay signal and $^{8}$B solar neutrino background events on a\nstatistical basis. Good separation will require the development of a slow\nscintillator with a 5 nsec risetime.\n", "  Recent LHCb experiments have shown us that there are two resonances in the\n$J/\\psi p$ channel in the $\\Lambda_b$ decay, whose spin and parity are most\nprobably (3/2$^-$ 5/2$^+$). In this work, we investigate the\n$I(J^P)=1/2(1/2^-)$, $1/2(3/2^-)$, and $1/2(5/2^-)$ $uudc{\\bar c}$ pentaquark\nstates by employing the quark cluster model. It is found that the color-octet\nisospin-1/2 spin-3/2 $uud$ configuration gives an attraction to such five-quark\nsystems. This configuration together with the color-octet $c{\\bar c}$ pair\ngives structures around the $\\Sigma_c^{(*)}{\\bar D}{}^{(*)}$ thresholds: one\nbound state, two resonances, and one large cusp are found in the $uudc{\\bar c}$\nnegative parity channels. We argue that these resonances and cusp may\ncorrespond to, or combine to form, the negative parity pentaquark peak observed\nby LHCb.\n", "  L shell line and total x-ray production cross sections in 78Pt, 79Au, 82Pb,\n83Bi, 90Th, and 92U targets ionized by 4-6 MeV/u fluorine ions were measured.\nThese cross sections are compared with available theories for L shell\nionization using single- and multiple-hole fluorescence and the Coster-Kronig\nyields. The ECPSSR and the ECUSAR theories exhibit good agreement with the\nmeasured data, whereas, the FBA theory overestimates them by a factor of two.\nAlthough for the F ion charge states q = 6-8 the multiple-hole atomic\nparameters do not significantly differ from the single-hole values, after an\naccount for the multiple-holes, our data are better in agreement with the\nECUSAR than the ECPSSR theory.\n", "  We present a frame-invariant method for detecting coherent structures from\nLagrangian flow trajectories that can be sparse in number, as is the case in\nmany fluid mechanics applications of practical interest. The method, based on\nprinciples used in graph coloring and spectral graph drawing algorithms,\nexamines a measure of the kinematic dissimilarity of all pairs of fluid\ntrajectories, either measured experimentally, e.g. using particle tracking\nvelocimetry; or numerically, by advecting fluid particles in the Eulerian\nvelocity field. Coherence is assigned to groups of particles whose kinematics\nremain similar throughout the time interval for which trajectory data is\navailable, regardless of their physical proximity to one another. Through the\nuse of several analytical and experimental validation cases, this algorithm is\nshown to robustly detect coherent structures using significantly less flow data\nthan is required by existing spectral graph theory methods.\n", "  The precision reached by recent lattice QCD results allows for the first time\nto investigate whether the measured hadronic spectrum is missing some\nadditional strange states, which are predicted by the Quark Model but have not\nyet been detected. This can be done by comparing some sensitive thermodynamic\nobservables from lattice QCD to the predictions of the Hadron Resonance Gas\nmodel (with the inclusion of decays [3]). We propose a set of specific\nobservables, defined as linear combinations of conserved charge fluctuations,\nwhich allow to investigate this issue for baryons containing one or more\nstrange quarks separately. Applications of these observables to isolate the\nmultiplicity fluctuations of kaons from lattice QCD, and their comparison with\nthe experimental results, are also discussed.\n", "  Due to the dominant electron capture by positrons from the molecular wall and\nthe spatial dephasing across the wall-width, a powerful diffraction effect\nuniversally underlies the positronium (Ps) formation from fullerenes. This\nresults into trains of resonances in the Ps formation cross section as a\nfunction of the positron beam energy, producing uniform structures in recoil\nmomenta in analogy with classical single-slit diffraction fringes in the\nconfiguration space. The prediction opens a hitherto unknown avenue of Ps\nspectroscopy with nanomaterials.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss recent results in light quark baryon\nspectroscopy involving CLAS data and higher level analysis results from the\npartial wave analysis by the Bonn-Gatchina group. New baryon states were\ndiscovered largely based on the open strangeness production channels $\\gamma p\n\\to K^+ \\Lambda$ and $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Sigma^0$. The data illustrate the great\npotential of the kaon-hyperon channel in the discovery of higher mass baryon\nresonances in s-channel production. Other channels with discovery potential,\nsuch as $\\gamma p \\to p \\omega$ and $\\gamma p \\to \\phi p$ are also discussed.\nIn the second part I will demonstrate on data the sensitivity of meson\nelectroproduction to expose the active degrees of freedom underlying resonance\ntransitions as a function of the probed distance scale. For several of the\nprominent excited states in the lower mass range the short distance behavior is\ndescribed by a core of three dressed-quarks with running quark mass, and\nmeson-baryon contributions make up significant parts of the excitation strength\nat large distances. Finally, an outlook is given of baryon resonance physics at\nthe 12 GeV CEBAF electron accelerator.\n", "  We study the H-dibaryon (uuddss) in holographic QCD for the first time.\nHolographic QCD is derived from a QCD-equivalent D-brane system\n($S^1$-compactified D4/D8/$\\overline{\\rm D8}$) in the superstring theory via\nthe gauge/gravity correspondence. In holographic QCD, all baryons appear as\ntopological chiral solitons of Nambu-Goldstone bosons and (axial) vector\nmesons. In this framework, the H-dibaryon can be described as an SO(3)-type\nhedgehog state. We present the formalism of the H-dibaryon in holographic QCD,\nand perform the calculation to investigate its properties in the chiral limit.\n", "  We systematically compare an event-by-event transport+viscous hydrodynamics\nhybrid model to data from the RHIC beam energy scan using a general Bayesian\nmethod. We demonstrate how the inclusion of multistrange hadron observables\naffects the outcome of the Bayesian analysis and conduct an in depth analysis\nof the viability of $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$ as probes of the transition region\nbetween a deconfined quark-gluon plasma and hadronic phase in heavy ion\ncollisions at higher-end RHIC collision energies. Utilizing UrQMD to model the\nfinal hadronic interactions, we examine the collision rates of $\\phi$ and\n$\\Omega$ and the modification to their transverse momentum spectra due to these\ninteractions.\n", "  We study the most probable way an interface moves on a macroscopic scale from\nan initial to a final position within a fixed time in the context of large\ndeviations for a stochastic microscopic lattice system of Ising spins with Kac\ninteraction evolving in time according to Glauber (non-conservative) dynamics.\nSuch interfaces separate two stable phases of a ferromagnetic system and in the\nmacroscopic scale are represented by sharp transitions. We derive quantitative\nestimates for the upper and the lower bound of the cost functional that\npenalizes all possible deviations and obtain explicit error terms which are\nvalid also in the macroscopic scale. Furthermore, using the result of a\ncompanion paper about the minimizers of this cost functional for the\nmacroscopic motion of the interface in a fixed time, we prove that the\nprobability of such events can concentrate on nucleations should the transition\nhappen fast enough.\n", "  The single-field consistency conditions and the local ansatz have played\nseparate but important roles in characterizing the non-Gaussian signatures of\nsingle- and multifield inflation respectively. We explore the precise\nrelationship between these two approaches and their predictions. We demonstrate\nthat the predictions of the single-field consistency conditions can never be\nsatisfied by a general local ansatz with deviations necessarily arising at\norder $(n_s-1)^2$. This implies that there is, in principle, a minimum\ndifference between single- and (fully local) multifield inflation in\nobservables sensitive to the squeezed limit such as scale-dependent halo bias.\nWe also explore some potential observational implications of the consistency\nconditions and its relationship to the local ansatz. In particular, we propose\na new scheme to test the consistency relations. In analogy with delensing of\nthe cosmic microwave background, one can deproject the coupling of the long\nwavelength modes with the short wavelength modes and test for residual\nanomalous coupling.\n", "  The ability to prepare, optically read out and coherently control single\nquantum states is a key requirement for quantum information processing.\nOptically active solid state emitters have emerged as promising candidates with\ntheir prospects for on chip integration as quantum nodes and sources of\ncoherent photons for connecting these nodes. Under strongly driving resonant\nlaser field, such quantum emitter can exhibit quantum behavior such as\nAutler-Townes splitting and Mollow triplet spectrum. Here we demonstrate\ncoherent control of a strongly driven optical transition in silicon vacancy\n(SiV) center in diamond. Rapid optical detection of photons enabled the\nobservation of time resolved coherent Rabi oscillations and the Mollow triplet\nfrom an optical transition of a single SiV defect. Detection with a probing\ntransition further confirmed Autler-Townes splitting generated by a strong\nlaser field. Coherence time of the emitted photons is shown to be comparable to\nits lifetime and robust under very strong driving laser field, which is\npromising for generation of indistinguishable photons.\n", "  Rumor models consider that information transmission occurs with the same\nprobability between each pair of nodes. However, this assumption is not\nobserved in social networks, which contain influential spreaders. To overcome\nthis limitation, we assume that central individuals have a higher capacity of\nconvincing their neighbors than peripheral subjects. By extensive numerical\nsimulations we find that the spreading is improved in scale-free networks when\nthe transmission probability is proportional to PageRank, degree, and\nbetweenness centrality. In addition, the results suggest that the spreading can\nbe controlled by adjusting the transmission probabilities of the most central\nnodes. Our results provide a conceptual framework for understanding the\ninterplay between rumor propagation and heterogeneous transmission in social\nnetworks.\n", "  We present parametrizations of the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1535)1/2^-$,\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1520)3/2^-$ and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1232)3/2^+$\ntransition amplitudes that are compatible with the analytic constraints at the\npseudothreshold (Siegert's theorem). The presented parametrizations also\nprovide a fair description of the experimental data. For the case of the\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1232)3/2^+$ transition, we discuss how the pion cloud\nparametrizations of the electric and the Coulomb quadrupole form factors can be\nadjusted according to the Siegert's theorem.\n", "  The spin wave function of the f0(980)-meson is constructed under the\nassumption that the meson is dominantly a quark-antiquark state. This wave\nfunction is used in a calculation of the gamma* - f0 transition form factors.\nIn the real-photon limit the results for the transverse form factor are\ncompared to the large momentum transfer data measured by the BELLE\ncollaboration recently. It turns out that, for the momentum-transfer range\nexplored by BELLE, the collinear approximation does not suffer, power\ncorrections to it, modeled as quark transverse moment effects, seem to be\nneeded. Mixing of the f0 with the sigma(500) is also briefly discussed.\n", "  The Belle-II experiment is expected to collect large data samples at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonances to study primarily $B$ and $B_s$\nmesons. We discuss what other data above the $B\\bar{B}$ threshold are of\ninterest. We propose to perform a high-statistics energy scan from the\n$B\\bar{B}$ threshold up to the highest possible energy, and to collect data at\nthe $\\Upsilon(6S)$ and at higher mass states if they are found in the scan. We\nemphasize the interest in increasing the maximal energy from 11.24\\,GeV to 11.5\n- 12\\,GeV in the future. These data are needed for investigation of bottomonium\nand bottomonium-like states.\n", "  In scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) conductance curves, the\nsuperconducting gap of cuprates is sometimes accompanied by small sub-gap\nstructures at very low energy. This was documented early on near vortex cores\nand later at zero magnetic field. Using mean-field toy models of coexisting\nd-wave superconductivity ($d$SC), \\emph{d}-form factor density wave ($d$FF-DW),\nand extended s-wave pair density wave ($s'$PDW), we find agreement with this\nphenomenon, with $s'$PDW playing a critical role. We explore the high\nvariability of the gap structure with changes in band structure and density\nwave (DW) wave vector, thus explaining why sub-gap structures may not be a\nuniversal feature in cuprates. In the absence of nesting, non-superconducting\nresults never show signs of pseudogap, even for large density waves magnitudes,\ntherefore reinforcing the idea of a distinct origin for the pseudogap, beyond\nmean-field theory. Therefore, we also briefly consider the effect of DWs on a\npre-existing pseudogap.\n", "  Based on the largest event sample of diffractively produced\n$\\pi^-\\pi^-\\pi^+$, obtained by a pion beam of $190~\\rm{GeV/c}$ momentum, the\nCOMPASS collaboration has performed the most advanced partial wave analysis on\nmulti-body final states, using the isobar model. The large number of waves\nincluded in the analysis reduces truncation effects. We have used fourteen out\nof a total of eighty-eight waves, to extract resonance parameters for eleven\nlight meson candidates, most of them observed previously. The coherence of the\nanalysis and the large variety of systematic studies has allowed to determine\nmass and width of most $a_{J}$ and $\\pi_{J}$ states with six different values\nof $J^{PC}$ below a mass of $2.1~\\rm{GeV/c^2}$, with high confidence. We\nexploited that the production rates of resonant and non-resonant contributions\nin these fourteen waves vary differently with the four-momentum transfer\nsquared in the reaction. In addition, we have performed the first isobar-freed\nanalysis in diffraction, from which we have determined the shape of the\n$[\\pi\\pi]_{S-wave}$ isobar for different $J^{PC}$ of the $3\\pi$ system.\n", "  Understanding the behavior of molecules interacting with superfluid helium\nrepresents a formidable challenge and, in general, requires approaches relying\non large-scale numerical simulations. Here we demonstrate that experimental\ndata collected over the last 20 years provide evidence that molecules immersed\nin superfluid helium form recently-predicted angulon quasiparticles [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 114, 203001 (2015)]. Most importantly, casting the many-body problem in\nterms of angulons amounts to a drastic simplification and yields effective\nmolecular moments of inertia as straightforward analytic solutions of a simple\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian. The outcome of the angulon theory is in good agreement\nwith experiment for a broad range of molecular impurities, from heavy to\nmedium-mass to light species. These results pave the way to understanding\nmolecular rotation in liquid and crystalline phases in terms of the angulon\nquasiparticle.\n", "  We have studied solid hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. With\nincreasing pressure we observe changes in the sample, going from transparent,\nto black, to a reflective metal, the latter studied at a pressure of 495 GPa.\nWe have measured the reflectance as a function of wavelength in the visible\nspectrum finding values as high as 0.90 from the metallic hydrogen. We have fit\nthe reflectance using a Drude free electron model to determine the plasma\nfrequency of 30.1 eV at T= 5.5 K, with a corresponding electron carrier density\nof 6.7x1023 particles/cm3, consistent with theoretical estimates. The\nproperties are those of a metal. Solid metallic hydrogen has been produced in\nthe laboratory.\n", "  We develop an asymptotic perturbation theory for the large logarithmic\nbehavior of the non-linear integro-differential equation describing the soft\ncorrelations of QCD jet measurements, the Banfi-Marchesini-Smye (BMS) equation.\nThis equation captures the late-time evolution of radiating color dipoles after\na hard collision. This allows us to prove that at large values of the control\nvariable (the non-global logarithm, a function of the infra-red energy scales\nassociated with distinct hard jets in an event), the distribution has a\ngaussian tail. We compute the decay width analytically, giving a closed form\nexpression, and find it to be jet geometry independent, up to the number of\nlegs of the dipole in the active jet. Enabling the asymptotic expansion is the\ncorrect perturbative seed, where we perturb around an anzats encoding formally\nno real emissions, an intuition motivated by the buffer region found in jet\ndynamics. This must be supplemented with the correct application of the BFKL\napproximation to the BMS equation in collinear limits. Comparing to the\nasymptotics of the conformally related evolution equation encountered in\nsmall-x physics, the Balitisky-Kovchegov (BK) equation, we find that the\nasymptotic form of the non-global logarithms directly maps to the black-disc\nunitarity limit of the BK equation, despite the contrasting physical pictures.\nIndeed, we recover the equations of saturation physics in the final state\ndynamics of QCD.\n", "  We study baryons in holographic QCD corresponding to 1+1 dimensional\nsingle-flavor ($N_f$=1) QCD for the first time. We formulate 1+1 QCD using an\n$S^1$-compactified D2/D8/$\\overline{\\rm D8}$ branes in the superstring theory,\nand describe the baryon as a topological configuration in 1+1 $N_f$=1 QCD,\ncorresponding to $\\Pi_1({\\rm U(1)})={\\bf Z}$. Unlike 1+3 QCD with $N_f \\ge 2$,\nhowever, we find that the low-dimensional baryonic soliton is generally\nunstable against a scale transformation/variation and swells infinitely in 1+1\n$N_f$=1 QCD at the leading of large $N_c$. We thus point out a serious\ndifficulty on the soliton picture of baryons in large $N_c$ in the\nsingle-flavor world in both 1+1 and 1+3 QCD. We also compare the\nlow-dimensional holographic baryon with the Abrikosov vortex, i.e., a stable\ntopological configuration in Type-II superconductors.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate for the first time that a single free electron\nin circular/spiral motion emits twisted photons carrying well defined orbital\nangular momentum along the axis of the electron circulation, in adding to spin\nangular momentum. We show that, when the electron velocity is relativistic, the\nradiation field contains harmonic components and the photons of l-th harmonic\ncarry lhbar total angular momentum for each. This work indicates that twisted\nphotons are naturally emitted by free electrons and more ubiquitous in\nlaboratories and in nature than ever been thought.\n", "  The interaction properties of cold dark matter (CDM) particle candidates,\nsuch as those of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), generically lead\nto the structuring of dark matter on scales much smaller than typical galaxies,\npotentially down to $\\sim 10^{-10}M_\\odot$. This clustering translates into a\nvery large population of subhalos in galaxies and affects the predictions for\ndirect and indirect dark matter searches (gamma rays and antimatter cosmic\nrays). In this paper, we elaborate on previous analytic works to model the\nGalactic subhalo population, while consistently with current observational\ndynamical constraints on the Milky Way. In particular, we propose a\nself-consistent method to account for tidal effects induced by both dark matter\nand baryons. Our model does not strongly rely on cosmological simulations as\nthey can hardly be fully matched to the real Milky Way, but for setting the\ninitial subhalo mass fraction. Still, it allows to recover the main qualitative\nfeatures of simulated systems. It can further be easily adapted to any change\nin the dynamical constraints, and be used to make predictions or derive\nconstraints on dark matter candidates from indirect or direct searches. We\ncompute the annihilation boost factor, including the subhalo-halo\ncross-product. We confirm that tidal effects induced by the baryonic components\nof the Galaxy play a very important role, resulting in a local average subhalo\nmass density $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of the total local dark matter mass density, while\nselecting in the most concentrated objects and leading to interesting features\nin the overall annihilation profile in the case of a sharp subhalo mass\nfunction. Values of global annihilation boost factors range from $\\sim 2$ to\n$\\sim 20$, while the local annihilation rate is about half as much boosted.\n", "  An analytical N-layer model for charge transport close to a surface is\nderived from the solution of Poisson's equation and used to describe\ndistance-dependent electrical four-point measurements on the microscale. As the\nN-layer model comprises a surface channel, multiple intermediate layers and a\nsemi-infinite bulk, it can be applied to semiconductors in combination with a\ncalculation of the near-surface band-bending to model very precisely the\nmeasured four-point resistance on the surface of a specific sample and to\nextract a value for the surface conductivity. For describing four-point\nmeasurements on sample geometries with mixed 2D-3D conduction channels often a\nvery simple parallel-circuit model has so far been used in the literature, but\nthe application of this model is limited, as there are already significant\ndeviations, when it is compared to the lowest possible case of the N-layer\nmodel, i.e. the 3-layer model. Furthermore, the N-layer model is applied to\npublished distance-dependent four-point resistance measurements obtained with a\nmulti-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) on Germanium(100) and\nSilicon(100) with different bulk doping concentrations resulting in the\ndetermination of values for the surface conductivities of these materials.\n", "  In this paper we prove a Nekhoroshev type theorem for perturbations of\nHamiltonians describing a particle subject to the force due to a central\npotential. Precisely, we prove that under an explicit condition on the\npotential, the Hamiltonian of the central motion is quasi-convex. Thus, when it\nis perturbed, two actions (the modulus of the total angular momentum and the\naction of the reduced radial system) are approximately conserved for times\nwhich are exponentially long with the inverse of the perturbation parameter.\n", "  We present a new teaching and outreach activity based around the construction\nof a three-dimensional chart of isotopes using LEGO$^{\\circledR}$ bricks. The\nactivity, \\emph{Binding Blocks}, demonstrates nuclear and astrophysical\nprocesses through a seven-meter chart of all nuclear isotopes, built from over\n26,000 LEGO$^{\\circledR}$ bricks. It integrates A-level and GCSE curricula\nacross areas of nuclear physics, astrophysics, and chemistry, including:\nnuclear decays (through the colours in the chart); nuclear binding energy\n(through tower heights); production of chemical elements in the cosmos; fusion\nprocesses in stars and fusion energy on Earth; as well as links to medical\nphysics, particularly diagnostics and radiotherapy.\n", "  We analyze the sensitivity of thermal fits to heavy-ion hadron yield data of\nALICE and NA49 collaborations to the systematic uncertainties in the hadron\nresonance gas (HRG) model related to the modeling of the eigenvolume\ninteractions. We find a surprisingly large sensitivity in extraction of\nchemical freeze-out parameters to the assumptions regarding eigenvolumes of\ndifferent hadrons. We additionally study the effect of including yields of\nlight nuclei into the thermal fits to LHC data and find even larger sensitivity\nto the modeling of their eigenvolumes. The inclusion of light nuclei yields,\nthus, may lead to further destabilization of thermal fits. Our results show\nthat modeling of eigenvolume interactions plays a crucial role in\nthermodynamics of HRG and that conclusions based on a non-interacting HRG are\nnot unique.\n", "  The role of compact binary mergers as the main production site of r-process\nelements is investigated by combining stellar abundances of Eu observed in the\nMilky Way, galactic chemical evolution (GCE) simulations, binary population\nsynthesis models, and Advanced LIGO gravitational wave measurements. We\ncompiled and reviewed seven recent GCE studies to extract the frequency of\nneutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) mergers that is needed in order to\nreproduce the observed [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] relationship. We used our simple\nchemical evolution code to explore the impact of different analytical\ndelay-time distribution (DTD) functions for NS-NS mergers. We then combined our\nmetallicity-dependent population synthesis models with our chemical evolution\ncode to bring their predictions, for both NS-NS mergers and black hole -\nneutron star mergers, into a GCE context. Finally, we convolved our results\nwith the cosmic star formation history to provide a direct comparison with\ncurrent and upcoming Advanced LIGO measurements. When assuming that NS-NS\nmergers are the exclusive r-process sites, and that the ejected r-process mass\nper merger event is 0.01 Msun, the number of NS-NS mergers needed in GCE\nstudies is about 10 times larger than what is predicted by standard population\nsynthesis models. These two distinct fields can only be consistent with each\nother when assuming optimistic rates, massive NS-NS merger ejecta, and low Fe\nyields for massive stars. Population synthesis models and GCE simulations are\nin agreement with the current upper limit (O1) established by Advanced LIGO\nduring their first run of observations. Upcoming measurements will provide\nimportant constraints on the actual local NS-NS merger rate, will provide\ninsights on the plausibility of the GCE requirement, and will help to define\nwhether or not compact binary mergers can be the dominant source of r-process\nelements in the Universe.\n", "  We discuss a 1+1 dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.\nThe model contains $N$ Majorana fermions at each lattice site with a\nnearest-neighbour hopping term. The SYK random interaction is restricted to low\nmomentum fermions of definite chirality within each lattice site. This gives\nrise to an ordinary 1+1 field theory above some energy scale and a low energy\nSYK-like behavior. We exhibit a class of low-pass filters which give rise to a\nrich variety of hyperscaling behaviour in the IR. We also discuss another set\nof generalizations which describes probing an SYK system with an external\nfermion, together with the new scaling behavior they exhibit in the IR.\n", "  We model transport of individuals across a heterogeneous scale-free network\nwhere a few weakly connected nodes exhibit heavy-tailed residence times. Using\nthe empirical law Axiom of Cumulative Inertia and fractional analysis we show\nthat `anomalous cumulative inertia' overpowers highly connected nodes in\nattracting network individuals. This fundamentally challenges the classical\nresult that individuals tend to accumulate in high-order nodes. The derived\nresidence time distribution has a non-trivial U-shape which we encounter\nempirically across human residence and employment times.\n", "  We give an explicit formula for the probability distribution based on a\nrelativistic extension of Brownian motion. The distribution 1) is properly\nnormalized and 2) obeys the tower law (semigroup property), so we can construct\nmartingales and self-financing hedging strategies and price claims (options).\nThis model is a 1-constant-parameter extension of the Black-Scholes-Merton\nmodel. The new parameter is the analog of the speed of light in Special\nRelativity. However, in the financial context there is no \"speed limit\" and the\nnew parameter has the meaning of a characteristic diffusion speed at which\nrelativistic effects become important and lead to a much softer asymptotic\nbehavior, i.e., fat tails, giving rise to volatility smiles. We argue that a\nnonlocal stochastic description of such (Levy) processes is inadequate and\ndiscuss a local description from physics. The presentation is intended to be\npedagogical.\n", "  The interaction of light with rotating media has attracted recent interest\nfor both fundamental and applied studies including rotational Doppler shift\nmeasurements. It is also possible to obtain amplification through the\nscattering of light with orbital angular momentum from a rotating and absorbing\ncylinder, as proposed by Zel'dovich more than 40 years ago. This amplification\nmechanism has never been observed experimentally yet has connections to other\nfields such as Penrose superradiance in rotating black holes. Here we propose a\nnonlinear optics system whereby incident light carrying orbital angular\nmomentum drives parametric interaction in a rotating medium. The crystal\nrotation is shown to take the phase-mismatched parametric interaction with\nnegligible energy exchange at zero rotation to amplification for sufficiently\nlarge rotation rates. The amplification is shown to result from breaking of\nanti-PT symmetry induced by the medium rotation.\n", "  A study of the multilayer system MgO/CoFeB(1.1nm)/Ta($t$)/CoFeB(0.8nm)/MgO is\npresented, where the two CoFeB layers are separated by a Ta interlayer of\nvarying thickness $t$. The magnetization properties deduced from complementary\ntechniques such as superconducting quantum interference magnetometry,\nferromagnetic resonance frequency measurements and Brillouin light scattering\nspectroscopy can be tuned by changing the Ta thickness between $t$=0.25 nm, 0.5\nnm and 0.75 nm. For $t$=0.5 nm, a ferromagnetic coupling is observed, whereas\nfor t=0.75 nm, the antiferromagnetic coupling needed to construct a synthetic\nferrimagnet is realized. In the later case, the shape of magnetic domain walls\nbetween two ferrimagnetic alignments or between a ferro- and a ferrimagnetic\nalignment is very different. This behavior can be interpreted as a result of\nthe change in dipolar as well as interlayer exchange energy and domain wall\npinning, which is an important conclusion for the realization of data storage\ndevices based on synthetic ferri- and antiferromagnets.\n", "  In this review, we develop the formalism employed to describe\ncharge-density-wave insulators in pump/probe experiments using ultra short\ndriving pulses of light. The theory emphasizes exact results in the simplest\nmodel for a charge-density wave insulator (given by a noninteracting systems\nwith two bands and a gap) and by employing nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field\ntheory to solve the Falicov-Kimball model in its ordered phase. We show both\nhow to develop the formalism and how the solutions behave. Care is taken to\ndescribe the details behind these calculations and to show how to verify their\naccuracy via sum-rule constraints.\n", "  The Pauli exclusion principle induces a repulsion between composite systems\nof identical fermions such as colliding atomic nuclei. Our goal is to study how\nheavy-ion fusion is impacted by this \"Pauli repulsion\". We propose a new\nmicroscopic approach, the density-constrained frozen Hartree-Fock method, to\ncompute the bare potential including the Pauli exclusion principle exactly.\nPauli repulsion is shown to be important inside the barrier radius and\nincreases with the charge product of the nuclei. Its main effect is to reduce\ntunnelling probability. Pauli repulsion is part of the solution to the\nlong-standing deep sub-barrier fusion hindrance problem.\n", "  We theoretically investigate optical detection of a weak classical force\nacting on a free particle in a dissipative coupling optomechanical system with\na degenerate parametric amplifier (PA). We show that the PA allows one to\nachieve the force sensitivity far better than the standard quantum limit (SQL)\nover a broad range of the detection frequencies. The improvement depends on the\nparametric gain and the driving power. Moreover, we discuss the effects of the\nmechanical damping and the thermal noise on the force sensitivity. We find that\nthe robustness of the force sensitivity much better than the SQL against the\nmechanical damping and the thermal noise is achievable in the presence of the\nPA with a high parametric gain. For the temperature $T = 1$ K, the improvement\nin sensitivity is better by a factor of about 7 when the driving power is set\nat a value corresponding to the SQL with no PA.\n", "  We analyze the Hamiltonian proposed by Smilansky to describe irreversible\ndynamics in quantum graphs and studied further by Solomyak and others. We\nderive a weak-coupling asymptotics of the ground state and add new insights by\nfinding the discrete spectrum numerically. Furthermore, we show that the model\nhas a rich resonance structure.\n", "  The WFIRST microlensing mission will measure precise light curves and\nrelative parallaxes for millions of stars, giving it the potential to\ncharacterize short-period transiting planets all along the line of sight and\ninto the galactic bulge. These light curves will enable the detection of more\nthan 100,000 transiting planets whose host stars have measured distances.\nAlthough most of these planets cannot be followed up, several thousand hot\nJupiters can be confirmed directly by detection of their secondary eclipses in\nthe WFIRST data. Additionally, some systems of small planets may be confirmed\nby detecting transit timing variations over the duration of the WFIRST\nmicrolensing survey. Finally, many more planets may be validated by ruling out\npotential false positives. The combination of WFIRST transits and microlensing\nwill provide a complete picture of planetary system architectures, from the\nvery shortest periods to unbound planets, as a function of galactocentric\ndistance.\n", "  Conditions for the appearance of topological charges are studied in the\nframework of the universal C*-algebra of the electromagnetic field, which is\nrepresented in any theory describing electromagnetism. It is shown that\nnon-trivial topological charges, described by pairs of fields localised in\ncertain topologically non-trivial spacelike separated regions, can appear in\nregular representations of the algebra only if the fields depend non-linearly\non the mollifying test functions. On the other hand, examples of regular vacuum\nrepresentations with non-trivial topological charges are constructed, where the\nunderlying field still satisfies a weakened form of \"spacelike linearity\". Such\nrepresentations also appear in the presence of electric currents. The status of\ntopological charges in theories with several types of electromagnetic fields,\nwhich appear in the short distance (scaling) limit of asymptotically free\nnon-abelian gauge theories, is also briefly discussed.\n", "  Circularly-polarized magneto-photoluminescence (magneto-PL) technique has\nbeen applied to investigate Zeeman effect in InAs/InGaAs/InAlAs quantum wells\n(QWs) in Faraday geometry. Structures with different thickness of the QW\nbarriers have been studied in magnetic field parallel and tilted with respect\nto the sample normal. Effective electron-hole g-factor has been found by\nmeasurement of splitting of polarized magneto-PL lines. Lande factors of\nelectrons have been calculated using the 14-band kp method and g-factor of\nholes was determined by subtracting the calculated contribution of the\nelectrons from the effective electron-hole g-factor. Anisotropy of the hole\ng-factor has been studied applying tilted magnetic field.\n", "  The oscillatory interlayer exchange interaction between two magnetic layers\nseparated by a metallic spacer is one of the few coherent quantum phenomena\nthat persist at room temperature. Here we show that this interaction can be\ncontrolled dynamically by illuminating the sample (e.g. a spin valve) with\nradiation in the 10-100 THz range. We predict that the exchange interaction can\nbe changed from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic (and vice versa) by tuning\nthe amplitude and/or the frequency of the radiation. Our chief theoretical\nresult is an expression that relates the dynamical exchange interaction to the\nstatic one that has already been extensively measured.\n", "  We present a simple method that allows to calculate the electromagnetic\nresponse of non-interacting electrons in strong magnetic field to arbitrary\norder in the gradients of external electric and magnetic fields. We illustrate\nthe method on both non-relativistic and massless Dirac electrons filling $N$\nLandau levels. First, we derive an exact relation between the electromagnetic\nresponse of the non-relativistic and Dirac electrons in the lowest Landau\nlevel. Next, we obtain a closed form expression for the polarization operator\nin the large $N$ (or weak magnetic field) limit. We explicitly show that in the\nlarge $N$ limit the random phase approximation (RPA) computation of the\npolarization tensor agrees - in leading and sub-leading order in $N$ - with a\nFermi liquid computation to {\\it all} orders in the gradient expansion and for\narbitrary value of the $\\mathrm{g}$-factor. Finally, we show that in the large\n$N$ limit the non-relativistic polarization tensor agrees with Dirac's in the\nleading and sub-leading orders in $N$, provided that Berry phase of the Dirac\ncone is taken into account via replacement $N\\longrightarrow N+\\frac{1}{2}$.\n", "  Continuing with our analysis of parton distributions in the nucleon, we\nextend our light-front quark model in order to obtain both the helicity\nindependent and helicity dependent parton distributions, analytically matching\nthe results of global fits at the initial scale $\\mu \\sim 1$ GeV, and which\nalso contain the correct Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution.\nWe also calculate the transverse parton, Wigner and Husimi distributions from a\nunified point of view, using our light-front wave functions and expressing them\nin terms of the parton distributions $q_v(x)$ and $\\delta q_v(x)$. Our results\nare very relevant for the current and future program of the COMPASS experiment\nat SPS (CERN).\n", "  We demonstrate laser driven acceleration of electrons to MeV-scale energies\nat 1kHz repetition rate using <10mJ pulses focused on near-critical density He\nand H2 gas jets. Using the H2 gas jet, electron acceleration to ~0.5MeV in\n~10fC bunches was observed with laser pulse energy as low as 1.3mJ. Increasing\nthe pulse energy to 10mJ, we measure ~1pC charge bunches with >1MeV energy for\nboth He and H2 gas jets.\n", "  A real-space formalism for density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT) is\nderived and applied for the computation of harmonic vibrational properties in\nmolecules and solids. The practical implementation using numeric atom-centered\norbitals as basis functions is demonstrated exemplarily for the all-electron\nFritz Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulations (FHI-aims) package. The\nconvergence of the calculations with respect to numerical parameters is\ncarefully investigated and a systematic comparison with finite-difference\napproaches is performed both for finite (molecules) and extended (periodic)\nsystems. Finally, the scaling tests and scalability tests on massively parallel\ncomputer systems demonstrate the computational efficiency.\n", "  Recent experiments and simulations have shown that unsteady turbulent flows,\nbefore reaching a dynamic equilibrium state, display a universal behaviour. We\nshow that the observed universal non-equilibrium scaling can be explained using\na non-equilibrium correction of Kolmogorov's energy spectrum. Given the\nuniversality of the experimental and numerical observations, the ideas\npresented here lay the foundation for the modeling of a wide class of unsteady\nturbulent flows.\n", "  These are the proceedings of the experimental overview of the production of\nopen heavy flavor at the international conference Strangeness in Quark Matter\n2016. Instead of a comprehensive overview, I focus on a few topics which the\nreader might find particularly interesting.\n", "  We present Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy measurements of the\nquasi-one dimensional superconductor K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$. We find that the Fermi\nsurface contains two Fermi surface sheets, with linearly dispersing bands not\ndisplaying any significant band renormalizations. The one-dimensional band\ndispersions display a suppression of spectral intensity approaching the Fermi\nlevel according to a linear power law, over an energy range of ~200 meV. This\nis interpreted as a signature of Tomonoga-Luttinger liquid physics, which\nprovides a new perspective on the possibly unconventional superconductivity in\nthis family of compounds.\n", "  In collaboration with Jogesh Pati, Abdus Salam challenged the chiral gauge\nnature of the Standard Model by paving the road towards the Left-Right\nsymmetric electro-weak theory. I describe here the logical and historical\nconstruction of this theory, by emphasising the pioneering and key role it\nplayed for neutrino mass. I show that it is a self-contained and predictive\nmodel with the Higgs origin of Majorana neutrino mass, in complete analogy with\nthe SM situation regarding charged fermions.\n", "  Nano-roughness limits the emittance of electron beams that can be generated\nby high efficiency photocathodes, such as the thermally reacted alkali\nantimonide thin films. However there is an urgent need for photocathodes that\ncan produce an order of magnitude or more lower emittance than present day\nsystems in order to increase the transverse coherence width of the electron\nbeam. In this paper we demonstrate a method for producing alkali antimonide\ncathodes with near atomic smoothness with high reproducibility.\n", "  Low-energy magnetic excitations of the easy-axis antiferromagnet\nTbFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ are investigated by far-infrared absorption and reflection\nspectroscopy in high magnetic fields up to 30 T. The observed field dependence\nof the resonance frequencies and the magnetization are reproduced by a\nmean-field spin model for magnetic fields applied both along and perpendicular\nto the easy axis. Based on this model we determined the full set of magnetic\ninteractions, including Fe-Fe and Fe-Tb exchange interactions, single-ion\nanisotropy for Tb ions and $g$-factors, which describe the ground-state spin\ntexture and the low-energy spin excitations of TbFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$. Compared\nto earlier studies we allow a small canting of the nearly Ising-like Tb moments\nto achieve a quantitative agreement with the magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements. The additional high energy magnetic resonance lines observed,\nbesides the two resonances expected for a two-sublattice antiferromagnet,\nsuggest a more complex six-sublattice magnetic ground state for\nTbFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$.\n", "  Intracavity Phase Interferometry is a phase sensing technique using\nmode-locked lasers in which two intracavity pulses circulate. The beat\nfrequency between the two output frequency combs is proportional to a phase\nshift to be measured. A laser gyro is a particular implementation of this\ndevice. The demonstrated sensitivity of $10^{-8}$ could be manipulated by\napplying a giant dispersion to each tooth of the comb. Such coupling is\nachieved with an intracavity etalon, resulting a large change in phase response\nof a ring laser. This change is shown to be unrelated to the average pulse\nvelocity within the laser cavity.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that optical phase conjugation can be used to\nfocus light through strongly scattering media even when far less than a photon\nper optical degree of freedom is detected. We found that the best achievable\nintensity contrast is equal to the total number of detected photons, as long as\nthe resolution of the system is high enough. Our results demonstrate that phase\nconjugation can be used even when the photon budget is extremely low, such as\nin high-speed focusing through dynamic media, or imaging deep inside tissue.\n", "  We consider the exclusion process on a ring with time-dependent defective\nbonds at which the hoping rate periodically switches between zero and one. This\nsystem models main roads in city traffics, intersecting with perpendicular\nstreets. We explore basic properties of the system, in particular dependence of\nthe vehicular flow on the parameters of signalization as well as the system\nsize and the car density. We investigate various types of the spatial\ndistribution of the vehicular density, and show existence of a shock profile.\nWe also measure waiting time behind traffic lights, and examine its\nrelationship with the traffic flow.\n", "  Many processes within galaxy clusters, such as those believed to govern the\nonset of thermally unstable cooling and AGN feedback, are dependent upon local\ndynamical timescales. However, accurately mapping the mass distribution within\nindividual clusters is challenging, particularly towards cluster centres where\nthe total mass budget has substantial radially-dependent contributions from the\nstellar, gas, and dark matter components. In this paper we use a small sample\nof galaxy clusters with deep Chandra observations and good ancillary tracers of\ntheir gravitating mass at both large and small radii to develop a method for\ndetermining mass profiles that span a wide radial range and extend down into\nthe central galaxy. We also consider potential observational pitfalls in\nunderstanding cooling in hot cluster atmospheres, and find tentative evidence\nfor a relationship between the radial extent of cooling X-ray gas and nebular\nH-alpha emission in cool core clusters. Amongst this small sample we find no\nsupport for the existence of a central 'entropy floor', with the entropy\nprofiles following a power-law profile down to our resolution limit.\n", "  Magnetic effects on chiral phase transition have been investigated in a\nmodified soft-wall AdS/QCD model, in which the dilaton field is taken to be\nnegative at the ultraviolet region and positive at the infrared region as in\nPhys.Rev.D93(2016),101901 and JHEP1604(2016)036. The magnetic field is\nintroduced into the background geometry by solving the Einstein-Maxwell system.\nAfter embedding the magnetized background geometry into the modified soft-wall\nmodel, the magnetic field dependent behavior of chiral condensate is worked out\nnumerically. It is found that, in the chiral limit, the chiral phase transition\nremains as a second order at finite magnetic field $B$, while the symmetry\nrestoration temperature and chiral condensate decrease with the increasing of\nmagnetic field in small $B$ region. When including finite quark mass effect,\nthe phase transition turns to be a crossover one, and the transition\ntemperature still decreases with increasing magnetic field $B$ when $B$ is not\nvery large. In this sense, inverse magnetic catalysis effect is observed in\nthis modified soft-wall AdS/QCD model.\n", "  In this paper we compute the QCD corrections for the triple Higgs boson\nproduction cross section via gluon fusion, within the heavy-top approximation.\nWe present, for the first time, analytical results for the next-to-leading\norder corrections, and also compute the soft and virtual contributions of the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order cross section. We provide predictions for the\ntotal cross section and the triple Higgs invariant mass distribution. We find\nthat the QCD corrections are large at both perturbative orders, and that the\nscale uncertainty is substantially reduced when the second order perturbative\ncorrections are included.\n", "  The applications of numerical relativity to cosmology are on the rise,\ncontributing insight into such cosmological problems as structure formation,\nprimordial phase transitions, gravitational-wave generation, and inflation. In\nthis paper, I present the infrastructure for the computation of inhomogeneous\ndust cosmologies which was used recently to measure the effect of nonlinear\ninhomogeneity on the cosmic expansion rate. I illustrate the code's\narchitecture, provide evidence for its correctness in a number of familiar\ncosmological settings, and evaluate its parallel performance for grids of up to\nseveral billion points. The code, which is available as free software, is based\non the Einstein Toolkit infrastructure, and in particular leverages the\nautomated-code-generation capabilities provided by its component Kranc.\n", "  We compute the two-loop electroweak correction to the production of the Higgs\nboson in gluon fusion to higher orders in the dimensional-regularization\nparameter $\\epsilon = (d-4)/2$. We employ the method of differential equations\nto compute the relevant integrals and express them in terms of Goncharov\npolylogarithms. Our result provides one of the necessary inputs for the\ncomputation of mixed three-loop QCD-electroweak corrections to $gg \\to H$.\n", "  The Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde (or WDVV) equations, as one would\nexpect from an integrable system, has many symmetries, both continuous and\ndiscrete. One class - the so-called Legendre transformations - were introduced\nby Dubrovin. They are a discrete set of symmetries between the stronger concept\nof a Frobenius manifold, and are generated by certain flat vector fields. In\nthis paper this construction is generalized to the case where the vector field\n(called here the Legendre field) is non-flat but satisfies a certain set of\ndefining equations. One application of this more general theory is to generate\nthe induced symmetry between almost-dual Frobenius manifolds whose underlying\nFrobenius manifolds are related by a Legendre transformation. This also\nprovides a map between rational and trigonometric solutions of the WDVV\nequations.\n", "  Information entropy has been proved to be an effective tool to quantify the\nstructural importance of complex networks. In the previous work (Xu et al, 2016\n\\cite{xu2016}), we measure the contribution of a path in link prediction with\ninformation entropy. In this paper, we further quantify the contribution of a\npath with both path entropy and path weight, and propose a weighted prediction\nindex based on the contributions of paths, namely Weighted Path Entropy (WPE),\nto improve the prediction accuracy in weighted networks. Empirical experiments\non six weighted real-world networks show that WPE achieves higher prediction\naccuracy than three typical weighted indices.\n", "  A review is given about the long-standing search for dibaryons, i.e.\nsix-quark objects, from the early days until present, when the first dibaryon\nresonance has been established, which has the potential of constituting a\ncompact six-quark object.\n", "  We present a model of a mechanical system with a vibrational mode spectrum\nidentical to the spectrum of electronic excitations in a tight-binding model of\ngraphene. The model consists of point masses connected by elastic couplings,\ncalled \"tri-bonds,\" that implement certain three-body interactions, which can\nbe tuned by varying parameters that correspond to the relative hopping\namplitudes on the different bond directions in graphene. In the mechanical\nmodel, this is accomplished by varying the location of a pivot point that\ndetermines the allowed rigid rotations of a single tri-bond. The infinite\nsystem constitutes a Maxwell lattice, with the number of degrees of freedom\nequal to the number of constraints imposed by the tri-bonds. We construct the\nequilibrium and compatibility matrices and analyze the model's phase diagram,\nwhich includes spectra with Weyl points for some placements of the pivot and\ntopologically polarized phases for others. We then discuss the edge modes and\nassociated states of self stress for strips cut from the periodic lattice.\nFinally, we suggest a physical realization of the tri-bond, which allows access\nto parameter regimes not available to experiments on (strained) graphene and\nmay be used to create other two-dimensional mechanical metamaterials with\ndifferent spectral features.\n", "  We experimentally study gravity-capillary wave turbulence on the interface\nbetween two immiscible fluids of close density with free upper surface. We\nlocally measure the wave height at the interface between both fluids by means\nof a highly sensitive laser Doppler vibrometer. We show that the inertial range\nof the capillary wave turbulence regime is significantly extended when the\nupper fluid depth is increased: The crossover frequency between the gravity and\ncapillary wave turbulence regimes is found to decrease whereas the dissipative\ncut-off frequency of the spectrum is found to increase. We explain these\nobservations by the progressive decoupling between waves propagating at the\ninterface and the ones at the free surface, using the full dispersion relation\nof gravity-capillary waves in a two-layer fluid of finite depths. The cut-off\nevolution is due to the disappearance of parasitic capillaries responsible for\nthe main wave dissipation for a single fluid.\n", "  We study numerically the critical behavior of a modified, active\nAsakura-Oosawa model for colloid-polymer mixtures. The colloids are modeled as\nself-propelled particles with Vicsek-like interactions. This system undergoes\nphase separation between a colloid-rich and a polymer-rich phase, whereby the\nphase diagram depends on the strength of the Vicsek-like interactions.\nEmploying a subsystem-block-density distribution analysis, we determine the\ncritical point and make an attempt to estimate the critical exponents. In\ncontrast to the passive model, we find that the critical point is not located\non the rectilinear diameter. A first estimate of the critical exponents $\\beta$\nand $\\nu$ is consistent with the underlying 3d-Ising universality class\nobserved for the passive model.\n", "  In the framework of the type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM-II) a charged\nHiggs search strategy is presented for the dominant production mode $gb\n\\rightarrow tH^\\pm$ at the 14 TeV LHC. We consider the decay process which\nincludes $t \\rightarrow bW^\\pm$ and $H^\\pm \\rightarrow AW^\\pm$, and a fully\nhadronic final state consisting of $bb\\bar{b}+\\mbox{jets}+X$. Dictated by the\n$b \\rightarrow s\\gamma$ constraints which render $M_{H^\\pm} > 480$ GeV we study\ntwo scenarios in which the charged Higgs mass is 750 GeV and the pseudoscalar\nHiggs mass is 200 GeV and 500 GeV. In this mass scheme highly boosted final\nstate objects are expected and handled with jet substructure techniques which\nalso acts to suppress the standard model background. A detailed detector\nanalysis is performed, followed by a multivariate analysis involving many\nkinematic variables to optimize signal to background significance. Finally the\nLHC search sensitivities for the two scenarios are presented for various\nintegrated luminosities.\n", "  Measuring the temperature structure of the solar atmosphere is critical to\nunderstanding how it is heated to high temperatures. Unfortunately, the\ntemperature of the upper atmosphere cannot be observed directly, but must be\ninferred from spectrally resolved observations of individual emission lines\nthat span a wide range of temperatures. Such observations are \"inverted\" to\ndetermine the distribution of plasma temperatures along the line of sight. This\ninversion is ill-posed and, in the absence of regularization, tends to produce\nwildly oscillatory solutions. We introduce the application of sparse Bayesian\ninference to the problem of inferring the temperature structure of the solar\ncorona. Within a Bayesian framework a preference for solutions that utilize a\nminimum number of basis functions can be encoded into the prior and many ad hoc\nassumptions can be avoided. We demonstrate the efficacy of the Bayesian\napproach by considering a test library of 40 assumed temperature distributions.\n", "  We have performed a novel comparison between electron-beam polarimeters based\non M{\\o}ller and Compton scattering. A sequence of electron-beam polarization\nmeasurements were performed at low beam currents ($<$ 5 $\\mu$A) during the\n$Q_{\\rm weak}$ experiment in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. These low current\nmeasurements were bracketed by the regular high current (180 $\\mu$A) operation\nof the Compton polarimeter. All measurements were found to be consistent within\nexperimental uncertainties of 1% or less, demonstrating that electron\npolarization does not depend significantly on the beam current. This result\nlends confidence to the common practice of applying M{\\o}ller measurements made\nat low beam currents to physics experiments performed at higher beam currents.\nThe agreement between two polarimetry techniques based on independent physical\nprocesses sets an important benchmark for future precision asymmetry\nmeasurements that require sub-1% precision in polarimetry.\n", "  We investigate a laser model for a resonant system of photons and ion\ncluster-solvated rotating water molecules in which ions in the cluster are\nidentical and have very low, non-relativistic velocities and direction of\nmotion parallel to a static electric field induced in a single direction. This\nmodel combines Dicke superradiation with wave-particle interaction. As the\nresult, we find that the equations of motion of the system are expressed in\nterms of a conventional free electron laser system. This result leads to a\nmechanism for dynamical coherence, induced by collective instability in the\nwave-particle interaction.\n", "  5-cell elliptical cavities are chosen for the main linac of China Accelerator\nDriven sub-critical System in the medium energy section. Each cavity is driven\nby one fundamental power coupler delivering RF power up to 150 kW. A single\nwindow, coaxial type coupler satisfying high power requirements, class 10 clean\nroom assembly with cavity and low heat load simultaneously was designed. This\npaper gives the details of RF design, external Q calculation and thermal\nanalysis as well as multipacting simulations of the coupler.\n", "  We study extreme events occurring in the transverse $(x,y)$ section of the\nfield emitted by a broad-area semiconductor laser with a saturable absorber.\nThe spatio-temporal events on which we perform the statistical analysis are\nidentified as maxima of the field intensity in the 3D space $(x,y,t)$. We\nidentify regions in the parameter space where extreme events are more likely to\noccur and we study the connection of those extreme events with the cavity\nsolitons that are known to exist in the same system, both stationary and\nself-pulsing.\n", "  The strong mass loss of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) is thought to play a\ncritical role in massive-star evolution, but their place in the evolutionary\nsequence remains debated. A key to understanding their peculiar instability is\ntheir high observed luminosities, which often depends on uncertain distances.\nHere we report direct distances and space motions of four canonical Milky Way\nLBVs---AG~Car, HR~Car, HD~168607, and (candidate) Hen~3-519---from the Gaia\nfirst data release. Whereas the distances of HR~Car and HD~168607 are\nconsistent with previous literature estimates within the considerable\nuncertainties, Hen~3-519 and AG~Car, both at $\\sim$2~kpc, are much closer than\nthe 6--8~kpc distances previously assumed. As a result, Hen~3-519 moves far\nfrom the locus of LBVs on the HR Diagram, making it a much less luminous\nobject. For AG~Car, considered a defining example of a classical LBV, its lower\nluminosity would also move it off the S~Dor instability strip. Lower\nluminosities allow both AG~Car and Hen~3-519 to have passed through a previous\nred supergiant phase, lower the mass estimates for their shell nebulae, and\nimply that binary evolution is needed to account for their peculiarities. These\nresults may also impact our understanding of LBVs as potential supernova\nprogenitors and their isolated environments. Improved distances will be\nprovided in the Gaia second data release, which will include additional LBVs.\nAG~Car and Hen~3-519 hint that this new information may alter our traditional\nview of LBVs.\n", "  We briefly review the formation of pion-mediated heavy-light exotic molecules\nwith both charm and bottom, under the general strictures of chiral and heavy\nquark symmetries. The charm isosinglet exotic molecules with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$\nbinds, which we identify as the reported neutral $X(3872)$. The bottom\nisotriplet exotic with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ binds, and is identified as a mixed\nstate of the reported charged exotics $Z^+_b(10610)$ and $Z^+_b(10650)$. The\nbound bottom isosinglet molecule with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is a possible neutral\n$X_b(10532)$ to be observed.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of exotic color-triplet scalar particles $X$ with\ncharge $|Q|=2/3, 4/3,5/3,7/3,8/3$ and $10/3$. If $X$ is a non-singlet of\n$SU(2)_W$ representation, mass splitting within the multiplet allows for\ncascade decays of the members into the lightest state. We study examples where\nthe lightest state, in turn, decays into a three-body $W^\\pm jj$ final state,\nand show that in such case the entire multiplet is compatible with existing\ndirect collider searches and indirect precision tests down to $m_X\\sim250$~GeV.\nHowever, bound states $S$, made of $XX^\\dag$ pairs at $m_S\\approx2m_X$, form\nunder rather generic conditions and their decay to diphoton can be the first\ndiscovery channel of the model. Furthermore, for $SU(2)_W$-non-singlets, the\nmode $S\\to W^+W^-$ may be observable and the width of $S\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ and\n$S\\to jj$ may appear large as a consequence of mass splittings within the\n$X$-multiplet. As an example we study in detail the case of an $SU(2)_W$\nquartet, finding that $m_X\\simeq450$~GeV is allowed by all current searches.\n", "  This article summarises the highlights of the recent experimental findings on\nstrangeness production presented at the 16th edition of the {\\it International\nConference on Strangeness in Quark Matter} in Berkeley. Results obtained by\neight large experimental collaborations (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, HADES, LHCb, NA-61,\nPHENIX, STAR) spanning a large range in centre-of-mass energy and a variety of\ncollision systems were presented at the conference. The article does not aim at\nbeing a complete review, but rather at connecting the experimental highlights\nof the different collaborations and at pointing towards questions which should\nbe addressed by these experiments in future.\n", "  Due to cosmic variance we cannot learn any more about large-scale\ninhomogeneities from the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) alone. More\ninformation on large scales is essential for resolving large angular scale\nanomalies in the CMB. Here we consider cross correlating the large-scale\nkinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect and probes of large-scale structure, a\ntechnique known as kSZ tomography. The statistically anisotropic component of\nthe cross correlation encodes the CMB dipole as seen by free electrons\nthroughout the observable Universe, providing information about long wavelength\ninhomogeneities. We compute the large angular scale power asymmetry,\nconstructing the appropriate transfer functions, and estimate the cosmic\nvariance limited signal to noise for a variety of redshift bin configurations.\nThe signal to noise is significant over a large range of power multipoles and\nnumbers of bins. We present a simple mode counting argument indicating that kSZ\ntomography can be used to estimate more modes than the primary CMB on\ncomparable scales. A basic forecast indicates that a first detection could be\nmade with next-generation CMB experiments and galaxy surveys. This paper\nmotivates a more systematic investigation of how close to the cosmic variance\nlimit it will be possible to get with future observations.\n", "  We study surface superconductivity involving the `drumhead' surface states of\n(doped) Weyl loop materials. The leading weak coupling instability in the bulk\nis toward a chiral superconducting order, which fully gaps the Fermi surface.\nIn this state the surface also becomes superconducting, with $p+ip$ symmetry.\nWe show that the surface SC state is \"topological\" as long as it is fully\ngapped, and the system traps Majoarana modes wherever a vortex line enters or\nexits the bulk. In contrast to true 2D $p+ip$ superconductors, these Majorana\nzero modes arise even in the \"strong pairing\" regime where the chemical\npotential is entirely above/below the drumhead. We also consider conventional\n$s$-wave pairing, and show that in this case the surface hosts a flat band of\ncharge neutral Majorana fermions, whose momentum range is given by the\nprojection of the bulk Fermi surface. Weyl loop materials thus provide access\nto new forms of topological superconductivity.\n", "  Systems of particles with long range interactions present two important\nprocesses: first, the formation of out-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary states\n(QSS), and the collisional relaxation towards Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium in\na much longer timescale. In this paper, we study the collisional relaxation in\nthe Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model (HMF) using the appropriate kinetic equations\nfor a system of $N$ particles at order $1/N$ : the Landau equation when\ncollective effects are neglected and the Lenard-Balescu equation when they are\ntaken into account. We derive explicit expressions for the diffusion\ncoefficients using both equations for any magnetization, and we obtain analytic\nexpressions for highly clustered configurations. An important conclusion is\nthat in this system collective effects are crucial in order to describe the\nrelaxation dynamics. We compare the diffusion calculated with the kinetic\nequations with simulations set up to simulate the system with or without\ncollective effects, obtaining a very good agreement between theory and\nsimulations.\n", "  We study dual conformal transformations of minimal area surfaces in $AdS_5\n\\times S^5$ corresponding to holographic smooth Wilson loops and some other\nrelated observables. To act with dual conformal transformations we map the\nstring solutions to the dual space by means of T-duality, then we apply a\nconformal transformation and finally T-dualize back to the original space. The\ntransformation maps between string solutions with different boundary contours.\nThe boundary contours of the minimal surfaces are not mapped back to the AdS\nboundary, and the regularized area of the surface changes.\n", "  Antiferromagnets and quantum XY magnets in three space dimensions are\ndescribed by an effective Lagrangian that exhibits the same structure as the\neffective Lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics with two light flavors. These\nsystems all share a spontaneously broken internal symmetry O($N$) $\\to$\nO($N$-1). Although the respective scales differ by many orders of magnitude,\nthe general structure of the low-temperature expansion of the partition\nfunction is the same. In the nonabelian case, logarithmic terms of the form\n$T^8 \\ln T$ emerge at three-loop order, while for $N$=2 the series only\ninvolves powers of $T^2$. The manifestation of the Goldstone boson interaction\nin the pressure, order parameter, and susceptibility is explored in presence of\nan external field.\n", "  Defect is no longer deemed an adverse aspect of graphene. Contrarily, it can\npave ways of extending applicability of graphene. Here, we discuss the effects\nof three types of defects on graphene: carbon deficiency, adatom (single Fe)\ndopant and introduction of functional groups (carboxyl, pyran group) on NO2 gas\nadsorption via density functional theory method. We have observed that the\nunsaturated carbon in defected graphene is highly active to attract NO2\nmolecules. Our study suggests that introducing Fe on graphene can enhance the\nNO2 adsorption process. Adsorption energy calculations suggest the enhancement\nin NO2 adsorption is more profound for Fe-doped mono and tetra vacant graphene\nthan Fe doped bi- and tri-vacant graphene. This study could potentially be\nuseful in developing adsorption-based applications of graphene.\n", "  In the CP violating supersymmetric extension of the standard model with local\ngauged baryon and lepton symmetries(BLMSSM), there are new CP violating sources\nwhich can give new contributions to the quark electric dipole moment (EDM).\nConsidering the CP violating phases, we analyze the EDMs of the quarks c and t.\nWe take into account the contributions from the one loop diagrams.\n  The numerical results are analyzed with some assumptions on the relevant\nparameter space. The numerical results for the c and t EDMs can reach large\nvalues.\n", "  Non-minimal composite Higgs scenarios can contain exotic Higgs states which,\nif getting observed at the Large Hadron Collider, will help to constrain the\nunderlying UV structure of the strong dynamics. Doubly charged Higgs bosons are\nwell-motivated scalar degrees of freedom in this context. Their phenomenology\nin typical composite scenarios can differ from well-established Higgs triplet\nextensions of the SM. Related search strategies are not necessarily adapted to\nsuch a scenario as a consequence. In this paper we discuss the sensitivity\nreach to doubly charged Higgs bosons with decays into pairs of same-sign $W$\nbosons. While production cross sections are small, we show that significant\nconstraints on $H^{\\pm\\pm}\\to W^{\\pm}W^{\\pm}$ can be obtained, providing a new\nopportunity to constrain the potential composite structure of the TeV scale up\nto $m_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}\\simeq 800$~GeV.\n", "  We derive both BPS and non-BPS first-order flow equations for magnetically\ncharged black strings in five-dimensional N=2 abelian gauged supergravity,\nusing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. This is first done for the coupling to\nvector multiplets only and U(1) Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) gauging, and then\ngeneralized to the case where also hypermultiplets are present, and abelian\nsymmetries of the quaternionic hyperscalar target space are gauged. We then use\nthese results to derive the attractor equations for near-horizon geometries of\nextremal black strings, and solve them explicitely for the case where the\nconstants appearing in the Chern-Simons term of the supergravity action satisfy\nan adjoint identity. This allows to compute in generality the central charge of\nthe two-dimensional conformal field theory that describes the black strings in\nthe infrared, in terms of the magnetic charges, the CY intersection numbers and\nthe FI constants. Finally, we extend the r-map to gauged supergravity and use\nit to relate our flow equations to those in four dimensions.\n", "  We report the results of $v_1$ and $dv_1/dy$ near mid-rapidity for $\\Lambda$,\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_s^0$ and $\\phi$ in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27 and 39~GeV using the STAR\ndetector at RHIC. The $dv_1/dy$ of $\\Lambda$ is found to be consistent with\nthat of the proton and shows a change in sign near $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =\n11.5$~GeV. The $v_{1}$ slope for $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\bar{p}$ and $\\phi$ shows a\nsimilar trend for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ $>$ 14.5~GeV, while below 14.5~GeV,\n$\\phi$ $v_{1}$ is consistent with zero but with a large uncertainty. The\n$dv_{1}/dy$ for net protons and net kaons is similar for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} >$\n14.5~GeV, but they deviate at lower beam energies.\n", "  We present the reduced dynamics of a bead in a Rouse chain which is submerged\nin a bath containing a driving agent that renders it out-of-equilibrium. We\nfirst review the generalized Langevin equation of the middle bead in an\nequilibrated bath. Thereafter, we introduce two driving forces. Firstly, we add\na constant force that is applied to the first bead of the chain. We investigate\nhow the generalized Langevin equation changes due to this perturbation for\nwhich the system evolves towards a new equilibrium state after some time.\nSecondly, we consider the case of stochastic active forces which will drive the\nsystem to a nonequilibrium state. Including these active forces results in a\nfrenetic contribution to the second fluctuation-dissipation relation, in accord\nwith a recent extension of the fluctuation-dissipation relation to\nnonequilibrium. The form of the frenetic term is analysed for the specific case\nof Gaussian, exponentially correlated active forces. We also discuss the\nresulting rich dynamics of the middle bead in which various regimes of normal\ndiffusion, subdiffusion and superdiffusion can be present.\n", "  The $\\mathrm{^{16}O}(\\alpha, \\alpha^{\\prime})$ reaction was studied at\n$\\theta_{lab} = 0^\\circ$ at an incident energy of $\\textrm{E}_{lab}$ = 200 MeV\nusing the K600 magnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS. Proton and $\\alpha$-decay\nfrom the natural parity states were observed in a large-acceptance\nsilicon-strip detector array at backward angles. The coincident charged\nparticle measurements were used to characterize the decay channels of the\n$0_{6}^{+}$ state in $\\mathrm{^{16}O}$ located at $E_{x} = 15.097(5)$ MeV. This\nstate is identified by several theoretical cluster calculations to be a good\ncandidate for the 4-$\\alpha$ cluster state. The results of this work suggest\nthe presence of a previously unidentified resonance at $E_{x}\\approx15$ MeV\nthat does not exhibit a $0^{+}$ character. This unresolved resonance may have\ncontaminated previous observations of the $0_{6}^{+}$ state.\n", "  Functional renormalization group (FRG) methods applied to calculations of\nisospin-symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter as well as neutron matter are\nreviewed. The approach is based on a chiral Lagrangian expressed in terms of\nnucleon and meson degrees of freedom as appropriate for the hadronic phase of\nQCD with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. Fluctuations beyond mean-field\napproximation are treated solving Wetterich's FRG flow equations. Nuclear\nthermodynamics and the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition are investigated in\ndetail, both in symmetric matter and as a function of the proton fraction in\nasymmetric matter. The equations of state at zero temperature of symmetric\nnuclear matter and pure neutron matter are found to be in good agreement with\nadvanced ab-initio many-body computations. Contacts with perturbative many-body\napproaches (in-medium chiral perturbation theory) are discussed. As an\ninteresting test case, the density dependence of the pion mass in the medium is\ninvestigated. The question of chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear and\nneutron matter is addressed. A stabilization of the phase with spontaneously\nbroken chiral symmetry is found to persist up to high baryon densities once\nfluctuations beyond mean-field are included. Neutron star matter including beta\nequilibrium is discussed under the aspect of the constraints imposed by the\nexistence of two-solar-mass neutron stars.\n", "  We study extremal correlation functions of chiral primary operators in the\nlarge-N SU(N) ${\\cal N} = 2$ superconformal QCD theory and present new results\nbased on supersymmetric localization. We discuss extensively the\nbasis-independent data that can be extracted from these correlators using the\nleading order large-N matrix model free energy given by the four-sphere\npartition function. Special emphasis is given to single-trace 2- and 3-point\nfunctions as well as a new class of observables that are scalars on the\nconformal manifold. These new observables are particular quadratic combinations\nof the structure constants of the chiral ring. At weak 't Hooft coupling we\npresent perturbative results that, in principle, can be extended to arbitrarily\nhigh order. We obtain closed-form expressions up to the first subleading order.\nAt strong coupling we provide analogous results based on an approximate\nWiener-Hopf method.\n", "  Experiments on magnetic nanoparticles in a viscous medium have shown that\nagglomerates form that display complex shapes. However, most theoretical\nresults predict more simple, ordered shapes, such as single-particle width\nchains. To account for this discrepancy we have created a theoretical model\nthat phenomenologically includes the bridging or \"stickiness\" between ligands\non nearby nanoparticles. This interaction is accounted for through a unitless\nstickiness parameter c that can be varied between 0 (no bridging between\nligands) and 1 (irreversible bridging or sticking together on impact). An\nanalytic estimate for the value of c is provided based on a comparison between\nthe time for a particle to diffuse to an agglomerate compared to the time for\nit to reorient into the local magnetic field direction. Numerical Langevin\nsimulations are performed using ferromagnetic, 50 nm and 25 nm diameter\nmagnetite nanoparticles with various ligand coating lengths in hexane in order\nto support the analytic estimate. The simulations produce agglomerates that are\nqualitatively and quantitatively similar to experimental results.\n", "  The clockwork is a mechanism for generating light particles with\nexponentially suppressed interactions in theories which contain no small\nparameters at the fundamental level. We develop a general description of the\nclockwork mechanism valid for scalars, fermions, gauge bosons, and gravitons.\nThis mechanism can be implemented with a discrete set of new fields or, in its\ncontinuum version, through an extra spatial dimension. In both cases the\nclockwork emerges as a useful tool for model-building applications. Notably,\nthe continuum clockwork offers a solution to the Higgs naturalness problem,\nwhich turns out to be the same as in linear dilaton duals of Little String\nTheory. We also elucidate the similarities and differences of the continuum\nclockwork with large extra dimensions and warped spaces. All clockwork models,\nin the discrete and continuum, exhibit novel phenomenology with a distinctive\nspectrum of closely spaced resonances.\n", "  Degenerate scalar-tensor theories are recently proposed covariant theories of\ngravity coupled with a scalar field. Despite being characterised by higher\norder equations of motion, they do not propagate more than three degrees of\nfreedom, thanks to the existence of constraints. We discuss a geometrical\napproach to degenerate scalar-tensor systems, and analyse its consequences. We\nshow that some of these theories emerge as a certain limit of DBI Galileons. In\nabsence of dynamical gravity, these systems correspond to scalar theories\nenjoying a symmetry which is different from Galileon invariance. The scalar\ntheories have however problems concerning the propagation of fluctuations\naround a time dependent background. These issues can be tamed by breaking the\nsymmetry by hand, or by minimally coupling the scalar with dynamical gravity in\na way that leads to degenerate scalar-tensor systems. We show that distinct\ntheories can be connected by a relation which generalizes Galileon duality, in\ncertain cases also when gravity is dynamical. We discuss some implications of\nour results in concrete examples. Our findings can be helpful for assessing\nstability properties and understanding the non-perturbative structure of\nsystems based on degenerate scalar-tensor systems.\n", "  In a recent study we considered W3 Toda 4-point functions that involve matrix\nelements of a primary field with the highest-weight in the adjoint\nrepresentation of sl3. We generalize this result by considering a\nsemi-degenerate primary field, which has one null vector at level two. We\nobtain a sixth-order Fuchsian differential equation for the conformal blocks.\nWe discuss the presence of multiplicities, the matrix elements and the fusion\nrules.\n", "  We show in the present paper that pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems with\neven PT-symmetry admit a degeneracy structure. This kind of degeneracy is\nexpected traditionally in the odd PT-symmetric systems which is appropriate to\nthe fermions as shown by Jones-Smith and Mathur [1] who extended PT-symmetric\nquantum mechanics to the case of odd time-reversal symmetry. We establish that\nthe pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with even PT-symmetry admit a degeneracy\nstructure if the operator PT anticommutes with the metric operator {\\eta} which\nis necessarily indefinite. We also show that the Krein space formulation of the\nHilbert space is the convenient framework for the implementation of unbroken\nPT-symmetry. These general results are illustrated with great details for\nfour-level pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian with even PT-symmetry.\n", "  The seasonal and interannual variability of mesoscale circulation along the\neastern coast of the Sakhalin Island in the Okhotsk Sea is investigated using\nAVISO velocity field and oceanographic data for the period from 1993 to 2016.\nIt is found that mesoscale cyclones with the horizontal dimension of about 100\nkm occur there predominantly during summer, whereas anticyclones occur\npredominantly during fall and winter. The cyclones are generated due to the\ncoastal upwelling forced by northward winds and the positive wind stress curl\nalong the Sakhalin coast. The anticyclones are formed due to an inflow of\nlow-salinity Amur-River waters from the Sakhalin Gulf intensified by southward\nwinds and the negative wind stress curl in the cold season. The mesoscale\ncyclones support the high biological productivity at the eastern Sakhalin shelf\nin July - August.\n", "  We investigate Bose-Hubbard chains in a central depleted well configuration,\nwith dephasing in the middle well. We look at equilibration of populations,\npseudo-entropy, and entanglement measures. Using stochastic integration in the\ntruncated Wigner representation, we find that the initial quantum states of the\noccupied wells has an influence on the subsequent dynamics, and that with more\nthan three wells, the chains do not reach a full equilibrium, with edge effects\nbecoming important, and the time to reach the steady state becoming longer. The\nevolutions with and without phase diffusion are qualitatively different. We\nfind no convincing evidence of entanglement in the final states with phase\ndiffusion. Although at least one accepted measure indicates the presence of\nmode entanglement, we are easily able to show that it can give ambiguous\npredictions.\n", "  A linearizable version of multidimensional system of $n$-wave type nonlinear\nPDEs is proposed. This system is derived using the spectral representation of\nits solution via the procedure similar to the dressing method for the\nISTM-integrable nonlinear PDEs. The proposed system is shown to be completely\nintegrable, particular solution is represented.\n", "  An intriguing alternative to cold dark matter (CDM) is that the dark matter\nis a light ( $m \\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) boson having a de Broglie wavelength\n$\\lambda \\sim 1$ kpc, often called fuzzy dark matter (FDM). We describe the\narguments from particle physics that motivate FDM, review previous work on its\nastrophysical signatures, and analyze several unexplored aspects of its\nbehavior. In particular, (i) FDM halos smaller than about $10^7 (m/10^{-22}\n{\\rm eV})^{-3/2} M_\\odot$ do not form. (ii) FDM halos are comprised of a core\nthat is a stationary, minimum-energy configuration called a \"soliton\",\nsurrounded by an envelope that resembles a CDM halo. (iii) The transition\nbetween soliton and envelope is determined by a relaxation process analogous to\ntwo-body relaxation in gravitating systems, which proceeds as if the halo were\ncomposed of particles with mass $\\sim \\rho\\lambda^3$ where $\\rho$ is the halo\ndensity. (iv) Relaxation may have substantial effects on the stellar disk and\nbulge in the inner parts of disk galaxies. (v) Relaxation can produce FDM disks\nbut an FDM disk in the solar neighborhood must have a half-thickness of at\nleast $300 (m/10^{-22} {\\rm eV})^{-2/3}$ pc. (vi) Solitonic FDM sub-halos\nevaporate by tunneling through the tidal radius and this limits the minimum\nsub-halo mass inside 30 kpc of the Milky Way to roughly $10^8 (m/10^{-22} {\\rm\neV})^{-3/2} M_\\odot$. (vii) If the dark matter in the Fornax dwarf galaxy is\ncomposed of CDM, most of the globular clusters observed in that galaxy should\nhave long ago spiraled to its center, and this problem is resolved if the dark\nmatter is FDM.\n", "  In this article we provide canonically deformed classical Henon-Heiles\nsystem. Further we demonstrate that for proper value of deformation parameter\n$\\theta$ there appears chaos in the model.\n", "  The samples of Ga doped Cr2O3 oxide have been prepared using chemical\nco-precipitation route. X-ray diffraction pattern and Raman spectra have\nconfirmed rhombohedral crystal structure with space group R3-C. Magnetic\nmeasurement has indicated the dilution of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin order in\nGa doped alpha-Cr2O3 system oxide, where the AFM transition temperature of bulk\nalpha-Cr2O3 oxide at about 320 K has been suppressed and ferrimagnetic behavior\nis observed from the analysis of the temperature dependence of magnetization\ndata below 350 K. Apart from Ga doping effect, the spin freezing (50 K-70 K)\nand superparamagnetic behavior of the surface spins at lower temperatures,\ntypically below 50 K, have been exhibited due to nano-sized grains of the\nsamples. All the samples showed non-linear current-voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristics. However, I-V characteristics of the Ga doped samples are\nremarkably different from alpha-Cr2O3 sample. The I-V curves of Ga doped\nsamples have exhibited many unique electronic properties, e.g., bi-stable (low\nresistance- LR and high resistance-HR) electronic states and negative\ndifferential resistance (NDR). Optical absorption spectra revealed three\nelectronic transitions in the samples associated with band gap energy at about\n2.67-2.81 eV, 1.91-2.11 eV, 1.28-1.35 eV, respectively.\n", "  In order to go beyond the mean-field approximation, commonly used in the\ninflationary computations, an identification of the quantum constituents of the\ninflationary background is made. In particular, the homogeneous scalar field\nconfiguration is represented as a Bose-Einstein condensate of the off-shell\ninflaton degrees of freedom, with mass significantly screened by the\ngravitational binding energy. The gravitational counterpart of the classical\nbackground is considered to be a degenerate state of the off-shell longitudinal\ngravitons with the frequency of the order of the Hubble scale. As a result, the\norigin of the density perturbations in the slow-roll regime is identified as an\nuncertainty in the position of the constituent inflatons. While in the regime\nof eternal inflation, the scattering of the constituent gravitons becomes the\nrelevant source of the density perturbations. The gravitational waves, on the\nother hand, originate from the annihilation of the constituent longitudinal\ngravitons at all energy scales. This results in the quantum depletion of the\nclassical background. Leading to the upper bound on the number of e-folds,\nafter which the semiclassical description is expected to break down, which is\nestimated to be of the order of the entropy of the initial Hubble patch.\n", "  We determine the charm quark mass $\\hat{m}_c$ from QCD sum rules of moments\nof the vector current correlator calculated in perturbative QCD at ${\\cal O}\n(\\hat\\alpha_s^3)$. Only experimental data for the charm resonances below the\ncontinuum threshold are needed in our approach, while the continuum\ncontribution is determined by requiring self-consistency between various sum\nrules. Existing data from the continuum region can then be used to bound the\ntheoretic uncertainty. Our result is $\\hat{m}_c(\\hat{m}_c) = 1272 \\pm 8$~MeV\nfor $\\hat\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1182$.\n", "  We present an analysis of the stability spectrum of all stationary\nelliptic-type solutions to the focusing Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\n(NLS). An analytical expression for the spectrum is given. From this\nexpression, various quantitative and qualitative results about the spectrum are\nderived. Specifically, the solution parameter space is shown to be split into\nfour regions of distinct qualitative behavior of the spectrum. Additional\nresults on the stability of solutions with respect to perturbations of an\ninteger multiple of the period are given, as well as a procedure for\napproximating the greatest real part of the spectrum.\n", "  We report the discovery of EPIC 219388192 b, a transiting brown dwarf in a\n5.3-day orbit around a member star of Ruprecht-147, the oldest nearby open\ncluster association, which was photometrically monitored by K2 during its\nCampaign 7. We combine the K2 time-series data with ground-based adaptive\noptics imaging and high resolution spectroscopy to rule out false positive\nscenarios and determine the main parameters of the system. EPIC 219388192 b has\na radius of $R_\\mathrm{b}$=$0.937\\pm0.042$~$\\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$ and mass of\n$M_\\mathrm{b}$=$36.50\\pm0.09$~$\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, yielding a mean density of\n$59.0\\pm8.1$~$\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$. The host star is nearly a Solar twin with\nmass $M_\\star$=$0.99\\pm0.05$~$\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, radius\n$R_\\star$=$1.01\\pm0.04$~$\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$, effective temperature\n$\\mathrm{T_{eff}}$=$5850\\pm85$~K and iron abundance [Fe/H]=$0.03\\pm0.08$~dex.\nIts age, spectroscopic distance, and reddening are consistent with those of\nRuprecht-147, corroborating its cluster membership. EPIC 219388192 b is the\nfirst brown dwarf with precise determinations of mass, radius and age, and\nserves as benchmark for evolutionary models in the sub-stellar regime.\n", "  We present neutrino bulb model simulations of Majorana neutrino coherent spin\ntransformation (i.e., neutrino-antineutrino transformation), coupled to\nneutrino flavor evolution, for conditions corresponding to the neutronization\nburst epoch of an Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium (O-Ne-Mg) core collapse supernova.\nSignificant neutrino spin transformation in, for example, the neutronization\nburst, could alter the fluences of neutrinos and antineutrinos in a way which\nis potentially detectable for a Galactic core collapse supernova. Our\ncalculations for the first time incorporate geometric dilution in the spin\nevolution of the neutrinos and combine two-flavor and three-flavor evolution\nwith spin mixing physics. We find that significant spin transformations can\noccur, but only with a large neutrino luminosity and an electron fraction\n($Y_e$) profile which facilitates adiabatic conditions for the spin-channel\nresonance. Using our adopted parameters of neutrino energy spectra, luminosity,\ndensity and $Y_e$ profiles, our calculations require an unrealistically large\nneutrino rest mass to sustain the spin transformation. It is an open question\nwhether examining different density profiles or incorporating other sources of\nnonlinear feedback, such as $Y_e$ feedback, could mitigate this need. We find\nthat spin transformations are not sensitive to the flavor structure of\nneutrinos, i.e., the spin transformations occur regardless of whether we\nsimulate two- or three-flavor transformations. In the two-flavor case, spin\ntransformations were insensitive to the choice of solar or atmospheric\nmass-squared splitting as well as the choice of the Majorana phase.\nImportantly, our three-flavor simulations, as well as our two-flavor\nsimulations done with the atmospheric mass-squared splitting, show that the\ninclusion of spin degrees of freedom can significantly and qualitatively alter\nneutrino flavor evolution.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the specific heat $C_V$ at constant volume in\nthe normal state of a $p$-wave interacting Fermi gas. Including fluctuations in\nthe $p$-wave Cooper channel within the framework of the strong-coupling theory\ndeveloped by Nozi\\`eres and Schmitt-Rink, we clarify how $C_V$ as a function of\ntemperature varies, as one moves from the weak-coupling regime to the\nstrong-coupling limit. In the weak-coupling regime, $C_V$ is shown to be\nenhanced by $p$-wave pairing fluctuations, near the superfluid phase transition\ntemperature $T_{\\rm c}$. Similar enhancement of $C_V(T\\simeq T_{\\rm c})$ is\nalso obtained in the strong-coupling regime, which, however, reflects that\nsystem is close an ideal Bose gas of $p$-wave two-body bound molecules. Using\nthese results, we classify the normal state into (1) the normal Fermi gas\nregime, (2) the $p$-wave molecular Bose gas regime, and (3) the region between\nthe two, where $p$-wave pairing fluctuations are dominant. Since the current\nexperiments can only access the normal phase of a $p$-wave interacting Fermi\ngas, our results would be useful for experiments to understand strong-coupling\nproperties of this Fermi system above $T_{\\rm c}$.\n", "  The elusive connection between dynamics and local structure in supercooled\nliquids is an important piece of the puzzle in the unsolved problem of the\nglass transition. The Johari-Goldstein beta relaxation, ubiquitous in\nglass-forming liquids, exhibits mean properties that are strongly correlated to\nthe long-time alpha dynamics. However, the former comprises simpler, more\nlocalized motion, and thus has perhaps a more straightforward connection to\nstructure. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a\ntwo-dimensional, rigid diatomic molecule (the simplest structure exhibiting a\ndistinct beta process) to assess the role of the local liquid structure on both\nthe Johari-Goldstein beta and the alpha relaxation. Although the average\nproperties for these two relaxations are correlated, there is no connection\nbetween the beta and alpha properties of a given (single) molecule. The\npropensity for motion at long times is independent of the rate or strength of a\nmolecule's beta relaxation. The mobility of a molecule averaged over many\ninitial energies, a measure of the influence of structure, was found to be\nheterogeneous, with clustering at both the beta and alpha timescales. This\nheterogeneity is less extended spatially for the beta than for the alpha\ndynamics, as expected; however, the local structure is the more dominant\ncontrol parameter for the beta prcoess. In the glassy state, the arrangement of\nneighboring molecules determines entirely the relaxation properties, with no\ndiscernible effect from the particle momenta.\n", "  We construct models in which the SM Higgs mass scans in a landscape. This is\nachieved by coupling the SM to a monodromy axion field through Minkowski\n3-forms. The Higgs mass scans with steps given by delta(m_H^2)= eta mu f, where\nmu and f are the axion mass and periodicity respectively, and eta measures the\ncoupling of the Higgs to the associated 3-form. The observed Higgs mass scale\ncould then be selected on anthropic grounds. The monodromy axion may have a\nmass mu in a very wide range depending on the value of eta, and the axion\nperiodity f. For eta=1 and f = 10^10 GeV, one has 10^{-3}eV < mu < 10^3 eV, but\nultralight axions with e.g. mu = 10^{-17} eV are also possible. In a different\nrealization we consider landscape models coupled to the MSSM. In the context of\nSUSY, 4-forms appear as being part of the auxiliary fields of SUSY multiplets.\nThe scanning in the 4-forms thus translate into a landscape of vevs for the N=1\nauxiliary fields and hence as a landscape for the soft terms. This could\nprovide a rationale for the MSSM fine-tuning suggested by LHC data. In all\nthese models there are 3-forms coupling to membranes which induce transitions\nbetween different vacua through bubble nucleation. The Weak Gravity Conjecture\n(WGC) set limits on the tension of these membranes and implies new physics\nthresholds well below the Planck scale. More generaly, we argue that in the\ncase of string SUSY vacua in which the Goldstino multiplet contains a monodromy\naxion the WGC suggests a lower bound on the SUSY breaking scale m_{3/2} >\nM_s^2/M_p.\n", "  We consider the ground state energy of the Lieb-Liniger gas with $\\delta$\ninteraction in the weak coupling regime $\\gamma\\to0$. For bosons with repulsive\ninteraction, previous studies gave the expansion\n$e_{\\text{B}}(\\gamma)\\simeq\\gamma-4\\gamma^{3/2}/3\\pi+(1/6-1/\\pi^{2})\\gamma^{2}$.\nUsing a numerical solution of the Lieb-Liniger integral equation discretized\nwith $M$ points and finite strength $\\gamma$ of the interaction, we obtain very\naccurate numerics for the next orders after extrapolation on $M$ and $\\gamma$.\nThe coefficient of $\\gamma^{5/2}$ in the expansion is found approximately equal\nto $-0.00158769986550594498929$, accurate within all digits shown. This value\nis supported by a numerical solution of the Bethe equations with $N$ particles\nfollowed by extrapolation on $N$ and $\\gamma$. It was identified as\n$(3\\zeta(3)/8-1/2)/\\pi^{3}$ by G. Lang. The next two coefficients are also\nguessed from numerics. For balanced spin $1/2$ fermions with attractive\ninteraction, the best result so far for the ground state energy was\n$e_{\\text{F}}(\\gamma)\\simeq\\pi^{2}/12-\\gamma/2+\\gamma^{2}/6$. An analogue\ndouble extrapolation scheme leads to the value $-\\zeta(3)/\\pi^{4}$ for the\ncoefficient of $\\gamma^{3}$.\n", "  Using the empirical data from the Norwegian tax office, we analyse the wealth\nand income of the richest individuals in Norway during the period 2010--2013.\nWe find that both annual income and wealth level of the richest individuals are\ndescribable using the Pareto law. We find that the robust mean Pareto exponent\nover the four-year period to be $\\approx 2.3$ for income and $\\approx 1.5$ for\nwealth.\n", "  We study holographic isotropisation of homogeneous, strongly coupled,\nnon-Abelian plasmas in Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a negative cosmological\nconstant. We focus on small values of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter\n$\\lambda_{GB}$ and linearise the equations of motion around a time-dependent\nbackground solution with $\\lambda_{GB}=0$. We numerically solve the linearised\nequations and show that the entire time evolution of the pressure anisotropy\ncan be well approximated by the linear in $\\lambda_{GB}$ corrections to the\nquasinormal mode expansion, even in the cases of high anisotropy. We finally\nshow that, quite generally, the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy with\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term is approximately {\\it shifted} with respect to the\nevolution without it, with the sign of the shift being directly related to the\nsign of the $\\lambda_{GB}$ parameter. This suggests that finite coupling\ncorrections generically {\\it increase} the isotropisation time of strongly\ncoupled plasmas.\n", "  We investigate systems of three mutually interacting particles with masses of\nwhich the inner is much bigger than the intermediate and the latter is much\nbigger than the outer. Then the three-body problem reduces to the two-body\nscattering or structure of the light one in the field of the pseudo-nucleus\nformed by two others. We calculate analytically the properties of considered\nsystems, such as the scattering cross-sections, hyperfine splitting, Auger\ndecay of exited states and Lamb shits, presenting them as expansions in powers\nof the ratio of light to intermediate particle masses. This ratio is the small\nparameter of the studied problems.\n", "  Several recent studies have demonstrated that the Galactic bulge hosts two\ncomponents with different mean metallicities, and possibly different spatial\ndistribution and kinematics. As a consequence, both the metallicity\ndistribution and the radial velocity of bulge stars vary across different line\nof sights. We present here the metallicity distribution function of red clump\nstars in 26 fields spread across a wide area of the bulge, with special\nemphasis on fields close to Galactic plane, at latitudes b=-2 and b=-1, that\nwere not explored before. This paper includes new metallicities from a sample\nof about 5000 K giant stars, observed at spectral resolution R=6500, in the\nCalcium II Triplet region. They are the main dataset of the GIRAFFE Inner Bulge\nSurvey. As part of the same survey we have previously published results for a\nsample of about 600 K giant stars, at latitude b=-4 , derived from higher\nresolution spectra (R=22,500). Results. The combined sample allows us to trace\nand characterize the metal poor and metal rich bulge populations down to the\ninner bulge. We present a density map for each of the two components. Contrary\nto the expectations from previous works, we found the metal poor population to\nbe more centrally concentrated than the metal rich one, and with a more\naxisymmetric spatial distribution. The metal rich population, on the other\nhand, is arranged in a boxy distribution, consistent with an edge-on bar. By\ncoupling metallicities and radial velocities we show that the metal poor\npopulation has a velocity dispersion that varies rather mildly with latitude.\nOn the contrary, the metal rich population has a low velocity dispersion far\nfrom the plane (b=-8.5), but it has a steeper gradient with latitude, becoming\nhigher than the metal poor one in the innermost field (b=-1). [abridged]\n", "  Perturbations of a class of semiclassical strings known today as spiky\nstrings, are studied using the well-known Jacobi equations for small normal\ndeformations of an embedded timelike surface. It is shown that there exists\nfinite normal perturbations of the spiky string worldsheets embedded in a $2+1$\ndimensional flat spacetime. Such perturbations lead to a rounding off of the\nspikes, which, in a way, demonstrates the stable nature of the unperturbed\nworldsheet. The same features appear for the dual spiky string solution and in\nthe spiky as well as their dual solutions in $3+1$ dimensional flat spacetime.\nOur results are based on exact solutions of the corresponding Jacobi equations\nwhich we obtain and use while constructing the profiles of the perturbed\nconfigurations.\n", "  We present a numerical study of quasiperiodic foams, in which the bubbles are\ngenerated as duals of quasiperiodic Frank-Kasper phases. These foams are\ninvestigated as potential candidates to the celebrated Kelvin problem for the\npartition of three-dimensional space with equal volume bubbles and minimal\nsurface area. Interestingly, one of the computed structures falls close (but\nstill slightly above) the best known Weaire-Phelan periodic candidate. This\ngives additional clues to understanding the main geometrical ingredients\ndriving the Kelvin problem.\n", "  The next generation of surveys will greatly improve our knowledge of\ncosmological gravity. In this paper we focus on how Stage IV photometric\nredshift surveys, including weak lensing and multiple tracers of the matter\ndistribution and radio experiments combined with measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background will lead to precision constraints on deviations from\nGeneral Relativity. We use a broad subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor theories\nto forecast the accuracy with which we will be able to determine these\ndeviations and their degeneracies with other cosmological parameters. Our\nanalysis includes relativistic effects, does not rely on the quasi-static\nevolution and makes conservative assumptions about the effect of screening on\nsmall scales. We define a figure of merit for cosmological tests of gravity and\nshow how the combination of different types of surveys, probing different\nlength scales and redshifts, can be used to pin down constraints on the\ngravitational physics to better than a few percent, roughly an order of\nmagnitude better than present probes. Future cosmological experiments will be\nable to constrain the Brans-Dicke parameter at a level comparable to Solar\nSystem and astrophysical tests\n", "  Inflection-point inflation is an interesting possibility to realize a\nsuccessful slow-roll inflation when inflation is driven by a single scalar\nfield with its initial value below the Planck mass ($\\phi_I \\lesssim M_{Pl}$).\nIn order for a renormalization group (RG) improved effective $\\lambda \\phi^4$\npotential to develop an inflection-point, the quartic coupling $\\lambda(\\phi)$\nmust exhibit a minimum with an almost vanishing value in its RG evolution,\nnamely $\\lambda(\\phi_I) \\simeq 0$ and $\\beta_{\\lambda}(\\phi_I) \\simeq 0$, where\n$\\beta_{\\lambda}$ is the beta-function of the quartic coupling. As an example,\nwe consider the minimal gauged $B-L$ extended Standard Model at the TeV scale,\nwhere we identify the $B-L$ Higgs field as the inflaton field. For a successful\ninflection-point inflation, which is consistent with the current cosmological\nobservations, the mass ratios among the $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge boson, the\nright-handed neutrinos and the $B-L$ Higgs boson are fixed. Our scenario can be\ntested in the future collider experiments such as the High-Luminosity LHC and\nthe SHiP experiments. In addition, the inflection-point inflation provides a\nunique prediction for the running of the spectral index $\\alpha \\simeq - 2.7\n\\times 10^{-3}\\left(\\frac{60}{N}\\right)^2$ ($N$ is the $e$-folding number),\nwhich can be tested in the near future.\n", "  Planet migration is inherently a three-dimensional (3D) problem, because\nEarth-size planetary cores are deeply embedded in protoplanetary disks.\nSimulations of these 3D disks remain challenging due to the steep requirement\nin resolution. Using two different hydrodynamics code, FARGO3D and PEnGUIn, we\nsimulate disk-planet interaction for a 1 to 5 Earth-mass planet embedded in an\nisentropic disk. We measure the torque on the planet and ensure that the\nmeasurements are converged both in resolution and between the two codes. We\nfind that the torque is independent of the smoothing length of the planet's\npotential ($r_{\\rm s}$), and that it has a weak dependence on the adiabatic\nindex of the gaseous disk ($\\gamma$). The torque values correspond to an inward\nmigration rate qualitatively similar to previous linear calculations. We\nperform additional simulations with explicit radiative transfer using FARGOCA,\nand again find agreement between 3D simulations and existing torque formulae.\nWe also present the flow pattern around the planets, and show that active flow\nis present within the planet's Hill sphere, and meridional vortices are shed\ndownstream. The vertical flow speed near the planet is faster for a smaller\n$r_{\\rm s}$ or $\\gamma$, up to supersonic speeds for the smallest $r_{\\rm s}$\nand $\\gamma$ in our study.\n", "  We explore the nucleus of the nearby 10$^9M_{\\odot}$~early-type galaxy\n(ETGs), NGC~404, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS spectroscopy and WFC3\nimaging. We first present evidence for nuclear variability in UV, optical, and\ninfrared filters over a time period of 15~years. This variability adds to the\nalready substantial evidence for an accreting black hole at the center of\nNGC~404. We then redetermine the dynamical black hole mass in NGC~404 including\nmodeling of the nuclear stellar populations. We combine HST/STIS spectroscopy\nwith WFC3 images to create a local color-$M/L$~relation derived from stellar\npopulation modeling of the STIS data. We then use this to create a mass model\nfor the nuclear region. We use Jeans modeling to fit this mass model to\nadaptive optics (AO) stellar kinematic observations from Gemini/NIFS. From our\nstellar dynamical modeling, we find a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit on the black hole\nmass of $1.5\\times10^5M_{\\odot}$. Given the accretion evidence for a black\nhole, this upper limit makes NGC~404 the lowest mass central black hole with\ndynamical mass constraints. We find that the kinematics of H$_2$ emission line\ngas show evidence for non-gravitational motions preventing the use of gas\ndynamical modeling to constrain the black hole mass. Our stellar population\nmodeling also reveals that the central, counter-rotating region of the nuclear\ncluster is dominated by $\\sim$1~Gyr old populations.\n", "  We establish quantum thermodynamics for open quantum systems weakly coupled\nto their reservoirs when the system exhibits degeneracies. The first and second\nlaw of thermodynamics are derived, as well as a finite-time fluctuation theorem\nfor mechanical work and energy and matter currents. Using a double quantum dot\njunction model, local eigenbasis coherences are shown to play a crucial role on\nthermodynamics and on the electron counting statistics.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to extend the recent work of Paul &\nBandyopadhyay [Astrophys. Space Sci. 361, 172(2016)] on the existence of\ndifferent dust ion acoustic solitary structures in an unmagnetized\ncollisionless dusty plasma consisting of negatively charged static dust grains,\nadiabatic warm ions, nonthermal electrons and isothermal positrons in a more\ngeneralized form by considering nonthermal positrons instead of isothermal\npositrons. The present system supports both positive and negative potential\ndouble layers, coexistence of solitary waves of both polarities and positive\npotential supersolitons. The qualitative and the quantitative changes in\nexistence domains of different solitary structures which occur for the presence\nof nonthermal positrons have been presented in comparison with the results of\nPaul & Bandyopadhyay [Astrophys. Space Sci. 361, 172(2016)]. The formation of\nsupersoliton structures and their limitations have been analyzed with the help\nof phase portraits of the dynamical system corresponding to the dust ion\nacoustic solitary structures. Phase portrait analysis clearly indicates a\nsmooth transition between soliton and supersoliton.\n", "  The distribution of heavy elements is anomalously low in the asteroid main\nbelt region compared with elsewhere in the solar system. Observational surveys\nalso indicate a deficit in the number of small ($ \\le 50$~km size) asteroids\nthat is two orders of magnitude lower than what is expected from the single\npower-law distribution that results from a collisional coagulation and\nfragmentation equilibrium. Here, we consider the possibility that a major\nfraction of the original asteroid population may have been cleared out by\nJupiter's secular resonance, as it swept through the main asteroid belt during\nthe depletion of the solar nebula. This effect leads to the excitation of the\nasteroids' orbital eccentricities. Concurrently, hydrodynamic drag and\nplanet-disk tidal interaction effectively damp the eccentricities of sub-100\nkm-size and of super-lunar-size planetesimals, respectively. These combined\neffects lead to the asteroids' orbital decay and clearing from the present-day\nmain belt region ($\\sim 2.1-3.3$~AU). The intermediate-size (50 to several\nhundreds of kilometers) planetesimals therefore preferentially remain as main\nbelt asteroids near their birthplaces, with modest asymptotic eccentricities.\nThe smaller asteroids are the fragments of subsequent disruptive collisions at\nlater times as suggested by the present-day asteroid families. This scenario\nprovides a natural explanation for both the observed low surface density and\nthe size distribution of asteroids in the main belt. It also offers an\nexplanation for the confined spatial extent of the terrestrial planet building\nblocks without the requirement of extensive migration of Jupiter.\n", "  The dielectric permeability tensor for spin polarized plasmas is derived in\nterms of the spin-1/2 quantum kinetic model in six-dimensional phase space.\nExpressions for the distribution function and spin distribution function are\nderived in linear approximations on the path of dielectric permeability tensor\nderivation. The dielectric permeability tensor is derived the spin-polarized\ndegenerate electron gas. It is also discussed at the finite temperature regime,\nwhere the equilibrium distribution function is presented by the spin-polarized\nFermi-Dirac distribution. Consideration of the spin-polarized equilibrium\nstates opens possibilities for the kinetic modeling of the thermal spin current\ncontribution in the plasma dynamics.\n", "  We present the results of 61 new simulations of nonprecessing spinning black\nhole binaries with mass ratios $q=m_1/m_2$ in the range $1/3\\leq q\\leq1$ and\nindividual spins covering the parameter space $-0.85\\leq\\alpha_{1,2}\\leq0.85$.\nWe additionally perform 10 new simulations of nonspinning black hole binaries\nwith mass ratios covering the range $1/6\\leq q<1$. We follow the evolution for\ntypically the last ten orbits before merger down to the formation of the final\nremnant black hole. This allows for assessment of the accuracy of our previous\nempirical formulae for relating the binary parameters to the remnant final\nblack hole mass, spin and recoil. We use the new simulation to improve the fit\nto the above remnant formulae and add a formula for the peak luminosity of\ngravitational waves, produced around the merger of the two horizons into one.\nWe find excellent agreement (typical errors $\\sim0.1-0.2\\%$) for the mass and\nspin, and within $\\sim5\\%$ for the recoil and peak luminosity. These formulae\nhave direct application to parameter estimation techniques applied to LIGO\nobservations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers.\n", "  Chiral phase transition for three-flavor $N_f=2+1$ QCD with $m_u=m_d\\neq m_s$\nis investigated in a modified soft-wall holographic QCD model. Solving\ntemperature dependent chiral condensates from equations of motion of the\nmodified soft-wall model, we extract the quark mass dependence of the order of\nchiral phase transition in the case of $N_f=2+1$, and the result is in\nagreement with the \"Colombia Plot\", which is summarized from lattice\nsimulations and other non-perturbative methods. First order phase transition is\nobserved around the three flavor chiral limit $m_{u/d}=0, m_{s}=0$, while at\nsufficient large quark masses it turns to be a crossover phase transition. The\nfirst order and crossover regions are separated by a second order phase\ntransition line. The second order line is divided into two parts by the\n$m_{u/d}=m_s$ line, and the $m_s$ dependence of the transition temperature in\nthese two parts are totally contrast, which might indicate that the two parts\nare governed by different universality classes.\n", "  The observation of heavy-ion-like behaviour in pp collisions at the LHC\nsuggests that more physics mechanisms are at play than traditionally assumed.\nThe introduction e.g. of quark-gluon plasma or colour rope formation can\ndescribe several of the observations, but as of yet there is no established\nparadigm. In this article we study a few possible modifications to the Pythia\nevent generator, which describes a wealth of data but fails for a number of\nrecent observations. Firstly, we present a new model for generating the\ntransverse momentum of hadrons during the string fragmentation process,\ninspired by thermodynamics, where heavier hadrons naturally are suppressed in\nrate but obtain a higher average transverse momentum. Secondly, close-packing\nof strings is taken into account by making the temperature or string tension\nenvironment-dependent. Thirdly, a simple model for hadron rescattering is\nadded. The effect of these modifications is studied, individually and taken\ntogether, and compared with data mainly from the LHC. While some improvements\ncan be noted, it turns out to be nontrivial to obtain effects as big as\nrequired, and further work is called for.\n", "  Future Cosmic Microwave Background experiments together with upcoming galaxy\nand 21-cm surveys will provide extremely accurate measurements of different\ncosmological observables located at different epochs of the cosmic history. The\nnew data will be able to constrain the neutrino mass sum with the best\nprecision ever. In order to exploit the complementarity of the different\nredshift probes, a deep understanding of the physical effects driving the\nimpact of massive neutrinos on CMB and large scale structures is required. The\ngoal of this work is to describe these effects, assuming a summed neutrino mass\nclose to its minimum allowed value. We find that parameter degeneracies can be\nremoved by appropriate combinations, leading to robust and model independent\nconstraints. A joint forecast of the sensitivity of Euclid and DESI surveys\ntogether with a CORE-like CMB experiment leads to a $1\\sigma$ uncertainty of\n$14$~meV on the summed neutrino mass. However this particular combination gives\nrise to a peculiar degeneracy between $M_\\nu$ and the optical depth at\nreionization. Independent constraints from 21-cm surveys can break this\ndegeneracy and decrease the $1\\sigma$ uncertainty down to $12$~meV.\n", "  In chiral effective field theory the leading order (LO) nucleon-nucleon\npotential includes two contact terms, in the two spin channels $S=0,1$, and the\none-pion-exchange potential. When the pion degrees of freedom are integrated\nout, as in the pionless effective field theory, the LO potential includes two\ncontact terms only. In the three-nucleon system, the pionless theory includes a\nthree-nucleon contact term interaction at LO whereas the chiral effective\ntheory does not. Accordingly arbitrary differences could be observed in the LO\ndescription of three- and four-nucleon binding energies. We analyze the two\ntheories at LO and conclude that a three-nucleon contact term is necessary at\nthis order in both theories. In turn this implies that subleading three-nucleon\ncontact terms should be promoted to lower orders. Furthermore this analysis\nshows that one single low energy constant might be sufficient to explain the\nlarge values of the singlet and triplet scattering lengths.\n", "  Defect cavities in 3D photonic crystal can trap and store light in the\nsmallest volumes allowable in dielectric materials, enhancing non-linearities\nand cavity QED effects. Here, we study inverse rod-connected diamond (RCD)\ncrystals containing point defect cavities using plane-wave expansion and\nfinite-difference time domain methods. By optimizing the dimensions of the\ncrystal, wide photonic band gaps are obtained. Mid-bandgap resonances can then\nbe engineered by introducing point defects in the crystal. We investigate a\nvariety of single spherical defects at different locations in the unit cell\nfocusing on high-refractive-index contrast (3.3:1) inverse RCD structures;\nquality factors (Q-factors) and mode volumes of the resonant cavity modes are\ncalculated. By choosing a symmetric arrangement, consisting of a single sphere\ndefect located at the center of a tetrahedral arrangement, mode volumes < 0.06\ncubic wavelengths are obtained, a record for high index cavities.\n", "  The detection of environmental magnetic fields is well established by\noptically pumped atomic magnetometers. Another focus of magnetometry can be the\nresearch on magnetic or spin-active solid-state samples. Here we introduce a\nsimple and compact design of a rubidium-based M$_{\\mathrm{x}}$-magnetometer,\nwhich allows for hosting solid-state samples. The optical, mechanical and\nelectrical design is reported, as well as simple measurements which introduce\nthe ground-state spin-relaxation time, the signal-to-noise ratio of a\nmeasurement, and subsequently the overall sensitivity of the magnetometer. The\nmagnetometer is optimized for the most sensitive operation with respect to\nlaser power and magnetic field excitation at the Larmor frequency.\n", "  We consider two non-relativistic strings and their Galilean symmetries. These\nstrings are obtained as the two possible non-relativistic (NR) limits of a\nrelativistic string. One of them is non-vibrating and represents a continuum of\nnon-relativistic massless particles, and the other one is a non-relativistic\nvibrating string.\n  For both cases we write the generator of the most general point\ntransformation and impose the condition of Noether symmetry. As a result we\nobtain two sets of non-relativistic Killing equations for the vector fields\nthat generate the symmetry transformations. Solving these equations shows that\nNR strings exhibit two extended, infinite dimensional space-time symmetries\nwhich contain, as a subset, the Galilean symmetries. For each case, we compute\nthe associated conserved charges and discuss the existence of non-central\nextensions.\n", "  The dielectric permeability tensor for spin polarized plasmas derived in\nterms of the spin-1/2 quantum kinetic model in six-dimensional phase space in\nPart I of this work is applied for study of spectra of high-frequency\ntransverse and transverse-longitudinal waves propagating perpendicular to the\nexternal magnetic field. Cyclotron waves are studied at consideration of waves\nwith electric field directed parallel to the external magnetic field. It is\nfound that the separate spin evolution modifies the spectrum of cyclotron\nwaves. These modifications increase with the increase of the spin polarization\nand the number of the cyclotron resonance. Spin dynamics with no account of the\nanomalous magnetic moment gives a considerable modification of spectra either.\nThe account of anomalous magnetic moment leads to a fine structure of each\ncyclotron resonance. So, each cyclotron resonance splits on three waves.\nDetails of this spectrum and its changes with the change of spin polarization\nare studied for the first and second cyclotron waves. A cyclotron resonance\nexisting at $\\omega\\approx0.001\\mid\\Omega_{e}\\mid$ due to the anomalous\nmagnetic moment is also described, where $\\mid\\Omega_{e}\\mid$ is the cyclotron\nfrequency. The ordinary waves does not have any considerable modification. The\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic Berstein modes are studied during the\nanalysis of waves propagating perpendicular to the external magnetic field with\nthe electric field perturbation directed perpendicular to the external field. A\nmodification of the oscillatory structure caused by the equilibrium spin\npolarization is found in both regimes. Similar modification is found for the\nextraordinary wave spectrum.\n", "  We study the effects of the CP-breaking topological $\\theta$-term in the\nlarge $N_c$ QCD model by Witten, Sakai and Sugimoto with $N_f$ degenerate light\nflavors. We first compute the ground state energy density, the topological\nsusceptibility and the masses of the lowest lying mesons, finding agreement\nwith expectations from the QCD chiral effective action. Then, focusing on the\n$N_f=2$ case, we consider the baryonic sector and determine, to leading order\nin the small $\\theta$ regime, the related holographic instantonic soliton\nsolutions. We find that while the baryon spectrum does not receive ${\\cal\nO}(\\theta)$ corrections, this is not the case for observables like the\nelectromagnetic form factor of the nucleons. In particular, it exhibits a\ndipole term, which turns out to be vector-meson dominated. The resulting\nneutron electric dipole moment, which is exactly the opposite as that of the\nproton, is of the same order of magnitude of previous estimates in the\nliterature. Finally, we compute the CP-violating pion-nucleon coupling constant\n${\\bar g}_{\\pi N N}$, finding that it is zero to leading order in the large\n$N_c$ limit.\n", "  We study the resummation of soft gluon emission corrections to the production\nof a top-antitop pair in association with a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Starting from a soft-gluon resummation formula derived in previous\nwork, we develop a bespoke parton-level Monte Carlo program which can be used\nto calculate the total cross section along with differential distributions. We\nuse this tool to study the phenomenological impact of the resummation to\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, finding that these\ncorrections increase the total cross section and the differential distributions\nwith respect to NLO calculations of the same observables.\n", "  The extensive span of the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream makes it a promising tool\nfor studying the Milky Way gravitational potential. Characterizing its stellar\nkinematics can constrain halo properties and provide a benchmark for the Cold\nDark Matter galaxy formation paradigm. Accurate models of the disruption\ndynamics of the Sgr progenitor are necessary to employ this tool. Using a\ncombination of analytic modeling and N-body simulations, we build a new model\nof the Sgr orbit and resulting stellar stream. In contrast to previous models,\nwe simulate the full infall trajectory of the Sgr progenitor from the time it\nfirst crossed the Milky Way virial radius 8 Gyr ago. An exploration of the\nparameter space of initial phase-space conditions yields tight constraints on\nthe angular momentum of the Sgr progenitor. Our best-fit model is the first to\nreproduce accurately existing data on the 3D positions and radial velocities of\nthe debris detected 100 kpc away in the MW halo. In addition to replicating the\nmapped stream, the simulation also predicts the existence of several arms of\nthe Sgr stream extending to hundreds of kiloparsecs. The two most distant stars\nknown in the Milky Way halo coincide with the predicted structure. Additional\nstars in the newly predicted arms can be found with future data from the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope. Detecting a statistical sample of stars in the most\ndistant Sgr arms would provide an opportunity to constrain the Milky Way\npotential out to unprecedented Galactocentric radii.\n", "  We determine the site and bond percolation thresholds for a system of\ndisordered jammed sphere packings in the maximally random jammed state,\ngenerated by the Torquato-Jiao algorithm. For the site threshold, which gives\nthe fraction of conducting vs. non-conducting spheres necessary for\npercolation, we find $p_c = 0.3116(3)$, consistent with the 1979 value of\nPowell $0.310(5)$ and identical within errors to the threshold for the\nsimple-cubic lattice, 0.311608, which shares the same average coordination\nnumber of 6. In terms of the volume fraction $\\varphi$, the threshold\ncorresponds to a critical value $\\varphi_c = 0.199$. For the bond threshold,\nwhich apparently was not measured before, we find $p_c = 0.2424(3)$. To find\nthese thresholds, we considered two shape-dependent universal ratios involving\nthe size of the largest cluster, fluctuations in that size, and the second\nmoment of the size distribution; we confirmed the ratios' universality by also\nstudying the simple-cubic lattice with a similar cubic boundary. The results\nare applicable to many problems including conductivity in random mixtures,\nglass formation, and drug loading in pharmaceutical tablets.\n", "  The nature of the progenitor star (or system) for the Type IIn supernova (SN)\nsubclass remains uncertain. While there are direct imaging constraints on the\nprogenitors of at least four Type IIn supernovae, one of them being SN 2010jl,\nambiguities remain in the interpretation of the unstable progenitors and the\nexplosive events themselves. A blue source in pre-explosion HST/WFPC2 images\nfalls within the 5 sigma astrometric error circle derived from post-explosion\nground-based imaging of SN 2010jl. At the time the ground-based astrometry was\npublished, however, the SN had not faded sufficiently for post-explosion HST\nfollow-up observations to determine a more precise astrometric solution and/or\nconfirm if the pre-explosion source had disappeared, both of which are\nnecessary to ultimately disentangle the possible progenitor scenarios. Here we\npresent HST/WFC3 imaging of the SN 2010jl field obtained in 2014 and 2015, when\nthe SN had faded sufficiently to allow for new constraints on the progenitor.\nThe SN, which is still detected in the new images, is offset by 0.\"099 +/-\n0.\"008 (24 +/- 2 pc) from the underlying and extended source of emission that\ncontributes at least partially, if not entirely, to the blue source previously\nsuggested as the candidate progenitor in the WFPC2 data. This point alone rules\nout the possibility that the blue source in the pre-explosion images is the\nexploding star, but may instead suggest an association with a young (<5-6 Myr)\ncluster and still argues for a massive (>30 solar masses) progenitor. We obtain\nnew upper limits on the flux from a single star at the SN position in the\npre-explosion WFPC2 and Spitzer/IRAC images that may ultimately be used to\nconstrain the progenitor properties.\n", "  Results are presented from numerical simulations of the\nEinstein-Maxwell-Higgs equations with a broken U(1) symmetry. Coherent\nnontopological soliton solutions are shown to exist that separate an Anti-de\nSitter (AdS) true vacuum interior from a Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) false vacuum\nexterior. The stability of these bubble solutions is tested by perturbing the\ncharge of the coherent solution and evolving the time-dependent equations of\nmotion. In the weak gravitational limit, the short-term stability depends on\nthe sign of $(\\omega/ Q) \\, \\partial_\\omega Q$, similar to q-balls. The\nlong-term end state of the perturbed solutions demonstrates a rich structure\nand is visualized using \"phase diagrams.\" Regions of both stability and\ninstability are shown to exist for $\\kappa_g \\lesssim 0.015$, while solutions\nwith $\\kappa_g \\gtrsim 0.015$ were observed to be entirely unstable. Threshold\nsolutions are shown to demonstrate time-scaling laws, and the space separating\ntrue and false vacuum end states is shown to be fractal in nature, similar to\noscillons. Coherent states with superextremal charge-to-mass ratios are shown\nto exist and observed to collapse or expand, depending on the sign of the\ncharge perturbation. Expanding superextremal bubbles induce a phase transition\nto the true AdS vacuum, while collapsing superextremal bubbles can form\nnonsingular strongly gravitating solutions with superextremal RN exteriors.\n", "  There are four new structure functions for the spin-1 deuteron in comparison\nwith the ones for the spin-1/2 proton, and they are called $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$,\nand $b_4$. The twist-2 structure functions $b_1$ and $b_2$ are expressed by\ntensor-polarized parton distribution functions in the deuteron. HERMES\nmeasurements of $b_1$ are much different from the prediction of the standard\ndeuteron model with D-state admixture. It indicates that the structure\nfunctions $b_1$ and $b_2$ probe an interesting new aspect in the deuteron.\nThere is an approved experiment at JLab to measure $b_1$ and it is expected to\nstart in 2019. On the other hand, the measurement of tensor-polarized\ndistributions is under consideration at Fermilab by the Drell-Yan process with\nthe unpolarized proton beam and tensor-polarized deuteron target. It is\nexpected to provide crucial information on tensor-polarized antiquark\ndistributions. Since the distributions are small quantities, it is important to\nestimate the tensor-polarized spin asymmetry theoretically to find experimental\nfeasibility for an actual proposal at Fermilab.\n", "  We study single-file diffusion on a one-dimensional lattice with a random\nfractal distribution of hopping rates. For finite lattices, this problem shows\nthree clearly different regimes, namely, nearly independent particles, highly\ninteracting particles, and saturation. The mean-square displacement of a tagged\nparticle as a function of time follows a power law in each regime. The first\ncrossover time $t_s$, between the first and the second regime, depends on the\nparticle density. The other crossover time $t_l$, between the second and the\nthird regime, depends on the lattice length. We find analytic expressions for\nthese dependencies and show how the general behavior can be characterized by an\nuniversal form. We also show that the mean-square displacement of the center of\nmass presents two regimes; anomalous diffusion for times shorter than $t_l$,\nand normal diffusion for times longer than $t_l$. We study single-file\ndiffusion on a one-dimensional lattice with a random fractal distribution of\nhopping rates. For finite lattices, this problem shows three clearly different\nregimes, namely, nearly independent particles, highly interacting particles,\nand saturation. The mean-square displacement of a tagged particle as a function\nof time follows a power law in each regime. The first crossover time $t_s$,\nbetween the first and the second regime, depends on the particle density. The\nother crossover time $t_l$, between the second and the third regime, depends on\nthe lattice length. We find analytic expressions for these dependencies and\nshow how the general behavior can be characterized by an universal form. We\nalso show that the mean-square displacement of the center of mass presents two\nregimes; anomalous diffusion for times shorter than $t_l$, and normal diffusion\nfor times longer than $t_l$.\n", "  In the process of analyzing an observed light curve, one often confronts\nvarious scenarios that can mimic the planetary signals causing difficulties in\nthe accurate interpretation of the lens system. In this paper, we present the\nanalysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-0733. The light curve of the\nevent shows a long-term asymmetric perturbation that would appear to be due to\na planet. From the detailed modeling of the lensing light curve, however, we\nfind that the perturbation originates from the binarity of the source rather\nthan the lens. This result demonstrates that binary sources with roughly\nequal-luminosity components can mimic long-term perturbations induced by\nplanets with projected separations near the Einstein ring. The result also\nrepresents the importance of the consideration of various interpretations in\nplanet-like perturbations and of high-cadence observations for ensuring the\nunambiguous detection of the planet.\n", "  We introduce a new model for quasi one-dimensional materials, motivated by\nintriguing but not yet well-understood experiments that have shown\ntwo-dimensional polymer films to be promising materials for thermoelectric\ndevices. We consider a two-dimensional material consisting of many\none-dimensional systems, each treated as a Luttinger liquid, with weak\n(incoherent) coupling between them. This approximation of strong interactions\nwithin each one-dimensional chain and weak coupling between them is the\n\"quasi-atomic limit.\" We find integral expressions for the (interchain)\ntransport coefficients, including the electrical and thermal conductivities and\nthe thermopower, and we extract their power law dependencies on temperature.\nLuttinger liquid physics is manifested in a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw; the Lorenz number is larger than the Fermi liquid value by a factor\nbetween $\\gamma^2$ and $\\gamma^4$, where $\\gamma\\geq 1$ is a measure of the\nelectron-electron interaction strength in the system.\n", "  The ATLAS Forward Proton (AFP) detector is designed to identify events in\nwhich one or two protons emerge intact from the LHC collisions. AFP will\nconsist of a tracking detector, to measure the momentum of the protons, and a\ntime of flight system to reduce the background from multiple proton-proton\ninteractions. Following an extensive qualification period, 3D silicon pixel\nsensors were selected for the AFP tracker. The sensors were produced at CNM\n(Barcelona) during 2014. The tracker module assembly and quality control was\nperformed at IFAE during 2015. The assembly of the first AFP arm and the\nfollowing installation in the LHC tunnel took place in February 2016. This\npaper reviews the fabrication process of the AFP tracker focusing on the pixel\nmodules.\n", "  The influence of an intramolecular proton transfer reaction on the\nconductance of a molecular junction is investigated employing a generic model,\nwhich includes the effects of the electric field of the gate and leads\nelectrodes and the coupling to a dissipative environment. Using a quantum\nmaster equation approach it is shown that, depending on the localization of the\nproton, the junction exhibits a high or low current state, which can be\ncontrolled by external electric fields. Considering different regimes, which\nrange from weak to strong hydrogen bonds in the proton transfer complex and\ncomprise situations with high and low barriers, necessary preconditions to\nachieve control are analyzed. The results show that systems with a weak\nhydrogen bond and a significant energy barrier for the proton transfer can be\nused as molecular transistors or diodes.\n", "  Slow-light media are of interest in the context of quantum computing and\nenhanced measurement of quantum effects, with particular emphasis on using\nslow-light with single photons. We use light-in-flight imaging with a single\nphoton avalanche diode camera-array to image in situ pulse propagation through\na slow light medium consisting of heated rubidium vapour. Light-in-flight\nimaging of slow light propagation enables direct visualisation of a series of\nphysical effects including simultaneous observation of spatial pulse\ncompression and temporal pulse dispersion. Additionally, the single-photon\nnature of the camera allows for observation of the group velocity of single\nphotons with measured single-photon fractional delays greater than 1 over 1 cm\nof propagation.\n", "  Theories of gravity in the beyond Horndeski class recover the predictions of\ngeneral relativity in the solar system whilst admitting novel cosmologies,\nincluding late-time de Sitter solutions in the absence of a cosmological\nconstant. Deviations from Newton's law are predicted inside astrophysical\nbodies, which allow for falsifiable, smoking-gun tests of the theory. In this\nwork we study the pulsations of stars by deriving and solving the wave equation\ngoverning linear adiabatic oscillations to find the modified period of\npulsation. Using both semi-analytic and numerical models, we perform a\npreliminary survey of the stellar zoo in an attempt to identify the best\ncandidate objects for testing the theory. Brown dwarfs and Cepheid stars are\nfound to be particularly sensitive objects and we discuss the possibility of\nusing both to test the theory.\n", "  (abridged) We study the impact of the large-angle CMB polarization datasets\npublicly released by the WMAP and Planck satellites on the estimation of\ncosmological parameters of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. To complement large-angle\npolarization, we consider the high-resolution CMB datasets from either WMAP or\nPlanck, as well as CMB lensing as traced by Planck. In the case of WMAP, we\ncompute the large-angle polarization likelihood starting over from\nlow-resolution frequency maps and their covariance matrices, and perform our\nown foreground mitigation technique, which includes as a possible alternative\nPlanck 353 GHz data to trace polarized dust. We find that the latter choice\ninduces a downward shift in the optical depth $\\tau$, of order ~$2\\sigma$,\nrobust to the choice of the complementary high-l dataset. When the Planck 353\nGHz is consistently used to minimize polarized dust emission, WMAP and Planck\n70 GHz large-angle polarization data are in remarkable agreement: by combining\nthem we find $\\tau = 0.066 ^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, again very stable against the\nparticular choice for high-$\\ell$ data. We find that the amplitude of\nprimordial fluctuations $A_s$, notoriously degenerate with $\\tau$, is the\nparameter second most affected by the assumptions on polarized dust removal,\nbut the other parameters are also affected, typically between $0.5$ and\n$1\\sigma$. In particular, cleaning dust with \\planck's 353 GHz data imposes a\n$1\\sigma$ downward shift in the value of the Hubble constant $H_0$,\nsignificantly contributing to the tension reported between CMB based and direct\nmeasurements of $H_0$. On the other hand, we find that the appearance of the\nso-called low $\\ell$ anomaly, a well-known tension between the high- and\nlow-resolution CMB anisotropy amplitude, is not significantly affected by the\ndetails of large-angle polarization, or by the particular high-$\\ell$ dataset\nemployed.\n", "  We show that topological defects in the language of Landau-Ginzburg models\ncarry information about the RG flow between the non-compact orbifolds\n$\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{Z}_d$. We show that such defects correctly implement the\nbulk-induced RG flow on the boundary.\n", "  We present the status of the chemical freeze-out, determined from fits of\nhadron yields with the statistical hadronization (thermal) model, with focus on\nthe data at the LHC. A description of the yields of hadrons containing light\nquarks as well as the application of the model for the production of the\nJ/$\\psi$ meson is presented. The implications for the QCD phase diagram are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The search for 4He-eta bound states was performed with the WASA-at-COSY\nfacility via the measurement of the excitation function for the dd->3He n pi0\nand dd->3He p pi- processes. The beam momentum was varied continuously between\n2.127 GeV/c and 2.422 GeV/c, corresponding to the excess energy for the dd->4He\neta reaction ranging from Q=-70 MeV to Q=30 MeV. The luminosity was determined\nbased on the dd->3He n reaction and quasi-free proton-proton scattering via\ndd->pp n_spectator n_spectator reactions. The excitation functions determined\nindependently for the measured reactions do not reveal a structure which could\nbe interpreted as a narrow mesic nucleus. Therefore, the upper limits of the\ntotal cross sections for the bound state production and decay in\ndd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He n pi0 and dd->(4He-eta)_bound->3He p pi- processes\nwere determined taking into account the isospin relation between both the\nchannels considered. The results of the analysis depend on the assumptions of\nthe N* momentum distribution in the anticipated mesic-4He. Assuming as in the\nprevious works, that this is identical with the distribution of nucleons bound\nwith 20 MeV in 4He, we determined that (for the mesic bound state width in the\nrange from 5 MeV to 50 MeV) the upper limits at 90% confidence level are about\n3 nb and about 6 nb for npi0 and ppi- channels, respectively. However, based on\nthe recent theoretical findings of the N*(1535) momentum distribution in the\nN*-3He nucleus bound by 3.6 MeV, we find that the WASA-at-COSY detector\nacceptance decreases and hence the corresponding upper limits are 5 nb and 10\nnb for npi0 and ppi- channels respectively.\n", "  Adopting the gauge-invariant and path-dependent variables formalism, we\ncompute the interaction energy for a topological field theory describing\n$(1+3)$D topological superconductors in presence of external fields. As a\nresult, in the case of a constant electric field- strength expectation value,\nwe show that the interaction energy describes a purely screening phase, encoded\nin a Yukawa potential. On the other hand, in the case of a constant magnetic\nfield-strength and for a very small Josephson coupling constant, the\nparticle-antiparticle binding potential displays a linear term leading to the\nconfinement of static charge probes along with a screening contribution.\n", "  We experimentally realize an optical fiber ring resonator that includes a\ntapered section with subwavelength-diameter waist. In this section, the guided\nlight exhibits a significant evanescent field which allows for efficient\ninterfacing with optical emitters. A commercial tunable fiber beam splitter\nprovides simple and robust coupling to the resonator. Key parameters of the\nresonator such as its out-coupling rate, free spectral range, and birefringence\ncan be adjusted. Thanks to the low taper- and coupling-losses, the resonator\nexhibits an unloaded finesse of F=75+/-1, sufficient for reaching the regime of\nstrong coupling for emitters placed in the evanescent field. The system is\nideally suited for trapping ensembles of laser-cooled atoms along the nanofiber\nsection. Based on measured parameters, we estimate that the system can serve as\na platform for optical multimode strong coupling experiments. Finally, we\ndiscuss the possibilities of using the resonator for applications based on\nchiral quantum optics.\n", "  Here we address two nonequilibrium Green's functions approaches for a\nresonant tunneling structure under a sudden switch of a bias. Our aim is to\nstress that the time-dependent Keldysh formulation of Jauho, Wingreen and Meir,\nand the partition-free scheme of Stefanucci and Almbladh are formally\nequivalent in the ubiquitous case of wide-band limit and noninteracting\nelectrons, if leads and dot are in equilibrium before the time-dependent\nperturbation. We develop explicit closed formulas of the lesser Green's\nfunction and time-dependent current, reminding that the different integration\nlimits preclude a face-to-face comparison of two approaches. This study sheds\nlight on both practices, which are of great interest to the mesoscopic\ntransport community.\n", "  Income redistribution is the transfer of income from some individuals to\nothers directly or indirectly by means of social mechanisms, such as taxation,\npublic services and so on. Employing a spatial public goods game, we study the\ninfluence of income redistribution on the evolution of cooperation. Two kinds\nof evolutionary models are constructed, which describe local and global\nredistribution of income respectively. In the local model, players have to pay\npart of their income after each PGG and the accumulated income is redistributed\nto the members. While in the global model, all the players pay part of their\nincome after engaging in all the local PGGs, which are centered on himself and\nhis nearest neighbours, and the accumulated income is redistributed to the\nwhole population. We show that the cooperation prospers significantly with\nincreasing income expenditure proportion in the local redistribution of income,\nwhile in the global model the situation is opposite. Furthermore, the\ncooperation drops dramatically from the maximum curvature point of income\nexpenditure proportion. In particular, the intermediate critical points are\nclosely related to the renormalized enhancement factors.\n", "  We report on the growth and characterization of\nTi/$La_{1/3}$$Ca_{2/3}$Mn$O_3$/Si$O_x$/n-Si memristive devices. We demonstrate\nthat using current as electrical stimulus unveils an intermediate resistance\nstate, in addition to the usual high and low resistance states that are\nobserved in standard voltage controlled experiments. Based on thorough\nelectrical characterization (impedance spectroscopy, current-voltage curves\nanalysis), we disclose the contribution of three different microscopic regions\nof the device to the transport properties: an ohmic incomplete metallic\nfilament, a thin manganite layer below the filament tip exhibiting\nPoole-Frenkel like conduction, and the SiOx layer with an electrical response\nwell characterized by a Child-Langmuir law. Our results suggest that the\nexistence of the SiOx layer plays a key role in the stabilization of the\nintermediate resistance level, indicating that the combination of two or more\nactive RS oxides adds functionalities in relation to single-oxide devices. We\nunderstand that these multilevel devices are interesting and promising as their\nfabrication procedure is rather simple and they are fully compatible with\nstandard Si-based electronics.\n", "  We formulate a reduced-order strategy for efficiently forecasting complex\nhigh-dimensional dynamical systems entirely based on data streams. The first\nstep of our method involves reconstructing the dynamics in a reduced-order\nsubspace of choice using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR simultaneously\nallows for reconstruction of the vector field and more importantly, estimation\nof local uncertainty. The latter is due to i) local interpolation error and ii)\ntruncation of the high-dimensional phase space. This uncertainty component can\nbe analytically quantified in terms of the GPR hyperparameters. In the second\nstep we formulate stochastic models that explicitly take into account the\nreconstructed dynamics and their uncertainty. For regions of the attractor\nwhich are not sufficiently sampled for our GPR framework to be effective, an\nadaptive blended scheme is formulated to enforce correct statistical steady\nstate properties, matching those of the real data. We examine the effectiveness\nof the proposed method to complex systems including the Lorenz 96, the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky, as well as a prototype climate model. We also study the\nperformance of the proposed approach as the intrinsic dimensionality of the\nsystem attractor increases in highly turbulent regimes.\n", "  In this talk it is reported on analyses of l p -> l pi+ n and pi- p -> l+ l-\nn within the handbag approach. It is argued that recent measurements of hard\npion production performed by HERMES and CLAS clearly indicate the occurrence of\nstrong contributions from transversely polarized photons. The gamma*T -> pi\ntransitions are described by the transversity GPDs accompanied by twist-3 pion\nwave functions. The experiments also require strong contributions from the pion\npole which can be modeled as a classical one-pion exchange. With these\nextensions the handbag approach leads to results on cross sections and spin\nasymmetries in fair agreement with experiment. This approach is also used for\nan estimate of the partial cross sections for the exclusive Drell-Yan process.\n", "  It has been shown that the anomalies observed in $\\bar B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ and $\\bar B\\to \\bar K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays can be\nresolved by adding a single scalar or vector leptoquark to the Standard Model,\nwhile constraints from other precision measurements in the flavour sector can\nbe satisfied without fine-tuning. To further explore these two interesting\nscenarios, in this paper, we study their effects in the semi-leptonic\n$\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ decay. Using the best-fit solutions for\nthe operator coefficients allowed by the current data of mesonic decays, we\nfind that (i) the two scenarios give similar amounts of enhancements to the\nbranching fraction $\\mathcal B(\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau)$ and the\nratio $R_{\\Lambda_c}=\\mathcal B(\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\n\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau)/\\mathcal B(\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\\ell\\bar\\nu_\\ell)$, (ii) the\ntwo best-fit solutions in each of these two scenarios are also\nindistinguishable from each other, (iii) both scenarios give nearly the same\npredictions as those of the Standard Model for the longitudinal polarizations\nof $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\tau$ as well as the lepton-side forward-backward\nasymmetry. With future measurements of these observables in\n$\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\\tau\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ decay at the LHCb, the two leptoquark\nscenarios could be further tested, and even differentiated from the other NP\nexplanations for the $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ anomalies. We also discuss the\nfeasibility for the measurements of these observables at the LHC and the future\n$e^+e^-$ colliders.\n", "  Free-electron lasers (FELs) have been built ranging in wavelength from\nlong-wavelength oscillators using partial wave guiding through ultraviolet\nthrough hard x-ray that are either seeded or start from noise (SASE). In\naddition, FELs that produce different polarizations of the output radiation\nranging from linear through elliptic to circular polarization are currently\nunder study. In this paper, we develop a three-dimensional, time-dependent\nformulation that is capable of modeling this large variety of FEL\nconfigurations including different polarizations. We employ a modal expansion\nfor the optical field, i.e., a Gaussian expansion with variable polarization\nfor free-space propagation. This formulation uses the full Newton-Lorentz force\nequations to track the particles through the optical and magnetostatic fields.\nAs a result, arbitrary three-dimensional representations for different\nundulator configurations are implemented, including planar, helical, and\nelliptical undulators. In particular, we present an analytic model of an\nAPPLE-II undulator to treat arbitrary elliptical polarizations. To model\noscillator configurations, and allow propagation of the optical field outside\nthe undulator and interact with optical elements, we link the FEL simulation\nwith the optical propagation code OPC. We present simulations using the\nAPPLE-II undulator model to produce elliptically polarized output radiation,\nand present a detailed comparison with recent experiments using a tapered\nundulator configuration at the Linac Coherent Light Source. Validation of the\nnonlinear formation is also shown by comparison with experimental results\nobtained in the SPARC SASE FEL experiment at ENEA Frascati, a seeded tapered\namplifier experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the 10-kW Upgrade\nOscillator experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility.\n", "  We study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the radio continuum\nemission from the KINGFISH sample of nearby galaxies to understand the\nenergetics and origin of this emission. Effelsberg multi-wavelength\nobservations at 1.4GHz, 4.8GHz, 8.5GHz, and 10.5GHz combined with archive data\nallow us, for the first time, to determine the mid-radio continuum (1-10 GHz,\nMRC) bolometric luminosities and further present calibration relations vs. the\nmonochromatic radio luminosities. The 1-10 GHz radio SED is fitted using a\nBayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique leading to measurements for\nthe nonthermal spectral index and the thermal fraction f_th with mean values of\nalpha_nt=0.97+-0.16 (0.79+-0.15 for the total spectral index) and f_th= 10% +-\n9% at 1.4 GHz. The MRC luminosity changes over ~3 orders of magnitude in the\nsample. The thermal emission is responsible for ~23% of the MRC on average. We\nalso compare the extinction-corrected diagnostics of star formation rate with\nthe thermal and nonthermal radio tracers and derive the first star formation\ncalibration relations using the MRC radio luminosity. The nonthermal spectral\nindex flattens with increasing star formation rate surface density, indicating\nthe effect of the star formation feedback on the cosmic ray electron population\nin galaxies. Comparing the radio and IR SEDs, we find that the FIR-to-MRC ratio\ncould decrease with star formation rate, due to the amplification of the\nmagnetic fields in star forming regions. This particularly implies a decrease\nin the ratio at high redshifts, where mostly luminous/star forming galaxies are\ndetected.\n", "  A unified theory of the non-Abelian gauge interactions with gravity in the\nframework of a discretized Kaluaza-Kleine theory is constructed with a modified\nDirac operator and wedge product. All the couplings of chiral spinors to the\nnon-Abelian gauge fields emerge naturally as components of the couplings of the\nchiral spinors to the generalized gravity together with some new interactions.\nIn particular, the currently prevalent gravity-QCD-quark and\ngravity-electroweak-quark-lepton models are shown to follow as special cases of\nthe general framework.\n", "  In a previous joint experimental and theoretical study of the barrierless\nchemical reaction C(1D) + H2 at low temperatures (300-50 K) [K. M. Hickson,\nJ.-C. Loison, H. Guo, Y. V. Suleimanov, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2015, 6, 4194.],\nexcellent agreement was found between experimental thermal rate constants and\ntheoretical estimates based on ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) over the\ntwo lowest singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs). Here, we extend this work\nto one of its deuterated counterparts, C(1D) + D2, over the same temperature\nrange. Experimental and RPMD results are in very good agreement when\ncontributions from both PESs to this chemical reaction are included in the RPMD\nsimulations. The deviation between experiment and the RPMD calculations does\nnot exceed 25 % and both results exhibit a slight negative temperature\ndependence. The first excited 1A\" PES plays a more important role than the\nground 1A' PES as the temperature is decreased, similar to our previous studies\nof the C(1D) + H2 reaction but with a more pronounced effect. The small\ndifferences in temperature dependence between the earlier and present\nexperimental studies of C(1D) + H2/D2 reactions are discussed in terms of the\nuse of non-equilibrium populations of ortho/para-H2/D2. We argue that RPMD\nprovides a very convenient and reliable tool to study low-temperature chemical\nreactions.\n", "  Two-particle correlations obtained from parton showers that pass the hot and\ndense medium of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) can be used as an alternative\nobservable, in addition to the combination of the nuclear modification factor\n$R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$, to study the mechanisms of in-medium\nheavy quark energy-loss. In particular, angular correlations represent a\npromising tool to distinguish between energy loss due to collisional and\nradiative interactions of jet and medium particles. To this end, parton\ncascades were created in Monte-Carlo simulations, where individual particles\ncan undergo both parton splitting as well as an effective jet-medium\ninteraction. A first model simulates the effects of induced radiations on\nparton cascades. Its consequences on angular correlations of partons within\njets were studied in detail, with particular focus on angular broadening. The\nresults can be compared to a second model that effectively describes elastic\nscatterings of jet and medium particles.\n", "  We consider a system model of a general finite-state machine (ratchet) that\nsimultaneously interacts with three kinds of reservoirs: a heat reservoir, a\nwork reservoir, and an information reservoir, the latter being taken to be a\nrunning digital tape whose symbols interact sequentially with the machine. As\nhas been shown in earlier work, this finite-state machine can act as a demon\n(with memory), which creates a net flow of energy from the heat reservoir into\nthe work reservoir (thus extracting useful work) at the price of increasing the\nentropy of the information reservoir. Under very few assumptions, we propose a\nsimple derivation of a family of inequalities that relate the work extraction\nwith the entropy production. These inequalities can be seen as either upper\nbounds on the extractable work or as lower bounds on the entropy production,\ndepending on the point of view. Many of these bounds are relatively easy to\ncalculate and they are tight in the sense that equality can be approached\narbitrarily closely. In their basic forms, these inequalities are applicable to\nany finite number of cycles (and not only asymptotically), and for a general\ninput information sequence (possibly correlated), which is not necessarily\nassumed even stationary. Several known results are obtained as special cases.\n", "  Ratios of cumulants of net proton-number fluctuations measured by the STAR\nCollaboration show strong deviations from a skellam distribution, which should\ndescribe thermal properties of cumulant ratios, if proton-number fluctuations\nare generated in equilibrium and a hadron resonance gas (HRG) model would\nprovide a suitable description of thermodynamics at the freeze-out temperature.\nWe present some results on sixth order cumulants entering the calculation of\nthe QCD equation of state at non-zero values of the baryon chemical potential\n(mu_B) and discuss limitations on the applicability of HRG thermodynamics\ndeduced from a comparison between QCD and HRG model calculations of cumulants\nof conserved charge fluctuations. We show that basic features of the\n$\\mu_B$-dependence of skewness and kurtosis ratios of net proton-number\nfluctuations measured by the STAR Collaboration resemble those expected from a\nO(mu_B^2) QCD calculation of the corresponding net baryon-number cumulant\nratios.\n", "  We present the construction of unintegrated double parton distribution\nfunctions which include dependence on transverse momenta of partons. We extend\nthe formulation which was used to obtain the single unintegrated parton\ndistributions from the standard, integrated parton distribution functions.\nStarting from the homogeneous part of the evolution equations for the\nintegrated double parton distributions, we construct the unintegrated double\nparton distributions as the convolutions of the integrated double distributions\nand the splitting functions, multiplied by the Sudakov form factors. We show\nthat there exist three domains of external hard scales which require three\ndistinct forms of the unintegrated double distributions. The additional\ntransverse momentum dependence which arises through the Sudakov form factors\nleads to non-trivial correlations in the parton momenta. We also discuss the\nnon-homogeneous contribution to the unintegrated double parton distributions,\nwhich arises due to the splitting of a single parton into daughter partons with\nhigh transverse momenta. We analyze two cases, the unfolding of the transverse\nmomenta dependence from the last step of the evolution of two partons, and the\ncase where the transverse momenta are generated directly from the single parton\nsplitting.\n", "  The cross section for neutrino helicity spin-flip obtained from a new f(R, T)\nmodel of gravitation with dynamic torsion field introduced by one of the\nauthors in [1], is phenomenologically analyzed. To this end, due to the\nlogarithmical energy dependence of the cross section, the relation with the\naxion decay constant fa (Peccei-Quinn parameter) is used. Consequently the link\nwith the phenomenological energy/mass window is found from the astrophysical\nand high energy viewpoints. The highest helicity spin-flip cross-sectional\nvalues presented in this work coincide with a recent estimation on the axion\nmass computed in [2] in the framework of finite temperature extended lattice\nQCD and under cosmological considerations.\n", "  We investigate the surface electronic structures of polar 1T'-MoTe2, the Weyl\nsemimetal candidate realized through the nonpolar-polar structural phase\ntransition, by utilizing the laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) combined with first-principles calculations. Two kinds of domains with\ndifferent surface band dispersions are observed from a single-crystalline\nsample. The spin-resolved measurements further reveal that the spin\npolarizations of the surface and the bulk-derived states show the different\ndomain-dependences, indicating the opposite bulk polarity. For both domains,\nsome segment-like band features resembling the Fermi arcs are clearly observed.\nThe patterns of the arcs present the marked contrast between the two domains,\nrespectively agreeing well with the slab calculation of (0 0 1) and (0 0 -1)\nsurfaces. The present result strongly suggests that the Fermi arc connects the\nidentical pair of Weyl nodes on one side of the polar crystal surface, whereas\nit connects between the different pairs of Weyl nodes on the other side.\n", "  Observations by ISO and Spitzer towards young stellar objects (YSOs) showed\nthat CO$_2$ segregates in the icy mantles covering dust grains. Thermal\nprocessing of ice mixture was proposed as responsible for the segregation.\nAlthough several laboratory studied thermally induced segregation, a satisfying\nquantification is still missing. We propose that the diffusion of CO$_2$ along\npores inside water ice is the key to quantify segregation. We combined\nTemperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Reflection Absorption InfraRed\nSpectroscopy (RAIRS) to study how CO$_2$ molecules interact on a non-porous\namorphous solid water (np-ASW) surface. We found that CO$_2$ diffuses\nsignificantly on a np-ASW surface above 65~K and clusters are formed at well\nbelow one monolayer. A simple rate equation simulation finds that the diffusion\nenergy barrier of CO$_2$ on np-ASW is 2150$\\pm$50 K, assuming a diffusion\npre-exponential factor of 10$^{12}$ s$^{-1}$. This energy should also apply to\nthe diffusion of CO$_2$ on wall of pores. The binding energy of CO$_2$ from\nCO$_2$ clusters and CO$_2$ from H$_2$O ice have been found to be $2415\\pm20$\nand $2250\\pm20$~K, respectively, assuming the same prefactor for desorption.\nCO$_2$-CO$_2$ interaction is stronger than CO$_2$-H$_2$O interaction, in\nagreement with the experimental finding that CO$_2$ does not wet np-ASW\nsurface. For comparison, we carried out similar experiments with CO on np-ASW,\nand found that the CO-CO interaction is always weaker than CO-H$_2$O. As a\nresult, CO wets np-ASW surface. This study should be of help to uncover the\nthermal history of CO$_2$ on the icy mantles of dust grains.\n", "  In this article we report a stochastic evaluation of the recently proposed\nLCC multireference perturbation theory [Sharma S., and Alavi A., J. Chem. Phys.\n143, 102815, (2015)]. In this method both the zeroth order and first order\nwavefunctions are sampled stochastically by propagating simultaneously two\npopulations of signed walkers. The sampling of the zeroth order wavefunction\nfollows a set of stochastic processes identical to the one used in the FCIQMC\nmethod. To sample the first order wavefunction, the usual FCIQMC algorithm is\naugmented with a source term that spawns walkers in the sampled first order\nwavefunction from the zeroth order wavefunction. The second order energy is\nalso computed stochastically but requires no additional overhead outside of the\nadded cost of sampling the first order wavefunction. This fully stochastic\nmethod opens up the possibility of simultaneously treating large active spaces\nto account for static correlation and recovering the dynamical correlation\nusing perturbation theory. This method is used to study a few benchmark systems\nincluding the carbon dimer and aromatic molecules. We have computed the\nsinglet-triplet gaps of benzene and m-xylylene. For m-xylylene, which has\nproved difficult for standard CASSCF+PT, we find the singlet-triplet gap to be\nin good agreement with the experimental values.\n", "  We study rotating fermionic matter at finite temperature in the framework of\nthe Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In order to respect causality the rigidly\nrotating system must be bound by a cylindrical boundary with appropriate\nboundary conditions that confine the fermions inside the cylinder. We show the\nfinite geometry with the MIT boundary conditions affects strongly the phase\nstructure of the model leading to three distinct regions characterized by\nexplicitly broken (gapped), partially restored (nearly gapless) and\nspontaneously broken (gapped) phases at, respectively, small, moderate and\nlarge radius of the cylinder. The presence of the boundary leads to specific\nsteplike irregularities of the chiral condensate as functions of coupling\nconstant, temperature and angular frequency. These steplike features have the\nsame nature as the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with the crucial difference\nthat they occur in the absence of both external magnetic field and Fermi\nsurface. At finite temperature the rotation leads to restoration of\nspontaneously broken chiral symmetry while the vacuum at zero temperature is\ninsensitive to rotation (\"cold vacuum cannot rotate\"). As the temperature\nincreases the critical angular frequency decreases and the transition becomes\nsofter. A phase diagram in angular frequency-temperature plane is presented. We\nalso show that at fixed temperature the fermion matter in the chirally restored\n(gapless) phase has a higher moment of inertia compared to the one in the\nchirally broken (gapped) phase.\n", "  Two-dimensional field theories do not have a moduli space of vacua. Instead,\nit is common that their low-energy behavior is a sigma model with a target\nspace. When this target space is compact its renormalization group flow is\nstandard. When it is non-compact the continuous spectrum of operators can\nchange the qualitative behavior. Here we discuss two-dimensional gauge theories\nwith N=(2,2) supersymmetry. We focus on two specific theories, for which we\nargue that they flow to free chiral multiplets at low energies: the U(1) gauge\ntheory with one flavor (two chiral superfields with charges plus and minus one)\nand a non-zero Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and pure SU(N) gauge theories. We argue\nthat the renormalization group flow of these theories has an interesting order\nof limits issue. Holding the position on the target space fixed, the space\nflattens out under the renormalization group. On the other hand, if we first go\nto infinity on the target space and then perform the renormalization group, we\nalways have a non-trivial space, e.g. a cone with a deficit angle. We explain\nhow to interpret low-energy dualities between theories with non-compact target\nspaces. We expect a similar qualitative behavior also for other non-compact\nsigma models, even when they do not flow to free theories.\n", "  Extending our previous work, we study the relative entropy between the\nreduced density matrices obtained from globally excited states in conformal\nfield theories of arbitrary dimensions. We find a general formula in the small\nsubsystem size limit. When one of the states is the vacuum of the CFT, our\nresult matches with the holographic entanglement entropy computations in the\ncorresponding bulk geometries, including AdS black branes. We also discuss the\nfirst asymmetric part of the relative entropy and comment on some implications\nof the results on the distinguishability of black hole microstates in AdS/CFT.\n", "  Superintegrable systems of 2nd order in 3 dimensions with exactly 3-parameter\npotentials are intriguing objects. Next to the nondegenerate 4-parameter\npotential systems they admit the maximum number of symmetry operators but their\nsymmetry algebras don't close under commutation and not enough is known about\ntheir structure to give a complete classification. Some examples are known for\nwhich the 3-parameter system can be extended to a 4th order superintegrable\nsystem with a 4-parameter potential and 6 linearly independent symmetry\ngenerators. In this paper we use B\\^ocher contractions of the conformal Lie\nalgebra $so(5,C)$ to itself to generate a large family of 3-parameter systems\nwith 4th order extensions, on a variety of manifolds, and all from B\\^ocher\ncontractions of a single \"generic\" system on the 3-sphere. We give a\ncontraction scheme relating these systems. The results have myriad applications\nfor finding explicit solutions for both quantum and classical systems.\n", "  We present new anomalies in two-dimensional ${\\mathcal N} =(2, 2)$\nsuperconformal theories. They obstruct the shortening conditions of chiral and\ntwisted chiral multiplets at coincident points. This implies that marginal\ncouplings cannot be promoted to background superfields in short\nrepresentations. Therefore, standard results that follow from ${\\mathcal N}\n=(2, 2)$ spurion analysis are invalidated. These anomalies appear only if\nsupersymmetry is enhanced beyond ${\\mathcal N} =(2, 2)$. These anomalies\nexplain why the conformal manifolds of the K3 and $T^4$ sigma models are not\nK\\\"ahler and do not factorize into chiral and twisted chiral moduli spaces and\nwhy there are no ${\\mathcal N} =(2, 2)$ gauged linear sigma models that cover\nthese conformal manifolds. We also present these results from the point of view\nof the Riemann curvature of conformal manifolds.\n", "  The MuPix Telescope is a particle tracking telescope, optimized for tracking\nlow momentum particles and high rates. It is based on the novel High-Voltage\nMonolithic Active Pixel Sensors (HV-MAPS), designed for the Mu3e tracking\ndetector. The telescope represents a first application of the HV-MAPS\ntechnology and also serves as test bed of the Mu3e readout chain. The telescope\nconsists of up to eight layers of the newest prototypes, the MuPix7 sensors,\nwhich send data self-triggered via fast serial links to FPGAs, where the data\nis time-ordered and sent to the PC. A particle hit rate of 1 MHz per layer\ncould be processed. Online tracking is performed with a subset of the incoming\ndata. The general concept of the telescope, chip architecture, readout concept\nand online reconstruction are described. The performance of the sensor and of\nthe telescope during test beam measurements are presented.\n", "  We systematically explore the space of scalar effective field theories (EFTs)\nconsistent with a Lorentz invariant and local S-matrix. To do so we define an\nEFT classification based on four parameters characterizing 1) the number of\nderivatives per interaction, 2) the soft properties of amplitudes, 3) the\nleading valency of the interactions, and 4) the spacetime dimension. Carving\nout the allowed space of EFTs, we prove that exceptional EFTs like the\nnon-linear sigma model, Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and the special Galileon lie\nprecisely on the boundary of allowed theory space. Using on-shell momentum\nshifts and recursion relations, we prove that EFTs with arbitrarily soft\nbehavior are forbidden and EFTs with leading valency much greater than the\nspacetime dimension cannot have enhanced soft behavior. We then enumerate all\nsingle scalar EFTs in d<6 and verify that they correspond to known theories in\nthe literature. Our results suggest that the exceptional theories are the\nnatural EFT analogs of gauge theory and gravity because they are one-parameter\ntheories whose interactions are strictly dictated by properties of the\nS-matrix.\n", "  We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic\nsimulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a\nmachine-learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT)\npotential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials\nsimulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We\nfirst determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can\nachieve in carbon structures; then, using a novel hierarchical set of two-,\nthree-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can\nindeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and\nstructural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly\ncaptures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with state-of-the-art\nempirical potentials. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of\n\"diamond-like\" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an\nestimate of the amorphous material's surface energy, and simulations of\nhigh-temperature surface reconstructions (\"graphitization\"). The new\ninteratomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate\nsimulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.\n", "  We study the problems of deconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration and\nlocalisation of the low Dirac eigenmodes in a toy model of QCD, namely\nunimproved staggered fermions on lattices of temporal extension $N_T=4$. This\nmodel displays a genuine deconfining and chirally-restoring first-order phase\ntransition at some critical value of the gauge coupling. Our results indicate\nthat the onset of localisation of the lowest Dirac eigenmodes takes place at\nthe same critical coupling where the system undergoes the first-order phase\ntransition. This provides further evidence of the close relation between\ndeconfinement, chiral symmetry restoration and localisation of the low modes of\nthe Dirac operator on the lattice.\n", "  From the underlying non-linear realisation we compute the complete E11\ninvariant equations of motion in eleven dimensions, at the linearised level, up\nto and including level four in the fields. Thus we include the metric, the\nthree and six forms, the dual graviton and three fields at level four. The\nfields are linked by a set of duality equations, which are first order in\nderivatives and transform into each other under the E11 symmetries. From these\nduality relations we deduce second order equations of motion, including those\nfor the usual supergravity fields. As a result the on-shell degrees of freedom\nare those of the eleven dimensional supergravity. We also show that the level\nfour fields provide an eleven dimensional origin of Romans theory and lead to a\nnovel duality relation.\n", "  A deeply modulated, regular, continuous, oscillating current waveform is\nreliably and repeatably achieved during electropolishing of niobium single-cell\nelliptical radiofrequency cavities. Details of the technique and cavity test\nresults are reported here. The method is applicable for cavity frequencies in\nthe range 500 MHz to 3.9 GHz and can be extended to multicell structures.\n", "  Generic higher derivative theories are believed to be fundamentally\nunphysical because they contain Ostrogradsky ghosts. We show that within\ncomplex classical mechanics it is possible to construct higher derivative\ntheories that circumvent the Ostrogradsky theorem and have a real energy\nspectrum that is bounded from below. The complex theory can be canonically\nquantised. The resulting quantum theory does not suffer from the kinetic\ninstability and maintains the usual probabilistic interpretation without\nviolating the correspondence principle. As a proof of concept, we construct a\nclass of stable interacting complex higher derivative theories. This consistent\nand canonical framework allows us to analyse previous attempts to avoid the\nghosts that use non-canonical quantisation schemes, such as the Lee-Wick\ntheories, Dirac-Pauli quantisation or PT-symmetric quantum mechanics. The key\nto understand the would-be ghosts in any kinetically stable higher derivative\ntheory is to accept the complex system behind it.\n", "  We measure the branching ratios from the $y^8{\\rm P}_{9/2}$ excited state to\nsix metastable states of europium through fluorescence spectroscopy of an\natomic beam. The sum of the six branching ratios is estimated to be\n$1.05(2)\\times 10^{-3}$. This research provides us with insightful information\nto determine the feasibility of using the $a^8{\\rm S}_{7/2} - y^8{\\rm P}_{9/2}$\ntransition in order to implement the Zeeman slowing for europium atoms in the\nground state. Based on this result, we also propose a scheme for Zeeman slowing\nand magneto-optical trapping, using a specific metastable state which has a\ncyclic transition.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the strong decays of $2^+$ heavy-light states,\nnamely, the charmed $D^*_2(2460)^0$ meson and the charm-strange\n$D^*_{s2}(2573)^+$ meson. The method we adopt is the reduction formula, PCAC\nrelation and low energy theorem, following which, the transition amplitudes are\ncalculated. The wave functions of the heavy mesons involved are achieved by\nsolving the instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter equation. As the OZI-allowed two-body\nstrong decays give the dominant contribution, they can be used to estimate to\ntotal widths of mesons. Our results are: $\\Gamma[D^*_2(2460)^0]=51.3$ MeV and\n$\\Gamma[D^*_{s2}(2573)^+]=19.6$ MeV. The ratios of branching ratios of two main\nchannels are $Br[D^*_2(2460)^0\\rightarrow D^+\\pi^-]/Br[D^*_2(2460)^0\\rightarrow\nD^{\\ast+}\\pi^-]=2.13$ and $Br[D^*_{s2}(2573)^+\\rightarrow D^{\\ast 0}\nK^+]/Br[D^*_{s2}(2573)^+\\rightarrow D^0K^+]=0.08$, respectively.\n", "  We demonstrate electro-optic tuning of an on-chip lithium niobate\nmicroresonator with integrated in-plane microelectrodes. First two metallic\nmicroelectrodes on the substrate were formed via femtosecond laser process.\nThen a high-Q lithium niobate microresonator located between the\nmicroelectrodes was fabricated by femtosecond laser direct writing accompanied\nby focused ion beam milling. Due to the efficient structure designing, high\nelectro-optical tuning coefficient of 3.41 pm/V was observed.\n", "  We revisit possible glimpses of black-hole formation by looking at\nultra-planckian string-string collisions at very high final-state multiplicity.\nWe compare, in particular, previous results using the optical theorem, the\nresummation of ladder diagrams at arbitrary loop order, and the AGK cutting\nrules, with the more recent study of $2 \\rightarrow N$ scattering at $N \\sim s\nM_P^{-2} \\gg 1$. We argue that some apparent tension between the two approaches\ndisappears once a reinterpretation of the latter's results in terms of suitably\ndefined infrared-safe cross sections is adopted. Under that assumption, the\ntypical final state produced in an ultra-planckian collision does indeed appear\nto share some properties with those expected from the evaporation of a black\nhole of mass $\\sqrt{s}$, although no sign of thermalization is seen to emerge\nat this level of approximation.\n", "  We report the characterization and independant detection of K2-60b, as well\nas the detection and characterization of EPIC 216468514b, two transiting hot\ngaseous planets from the K2 space mission. We confirm the planetary nature of\nthe two systems and determine their fundamental parameters combining the K2\ntime-series data with FIES@NOT and HARPS-N@TNG spectroscopic observations.\nK2-60b has a radius of 0.683 +/- 0.037 RJup and a mass of 0.426 +/- 0.037 MJup\nand orbits a G4V star with an orbital period of 3.00267 +/- 0.00006 days. EPIC\n216468514b has a radius of 1.44 +/- 0.15RJup and a mass of 0.84 +/- 0.08 MJup\nand orbits an F9 IV star every 3.31392 +/- 0.00002 days. K2-60b is among the\nfew planets at the edge of the so-called \"desert\" of short-period sub Jovian\nplanets. EPIC 216468514b is a highly inflated Jovian planet orbiting an evolved\nstar about to leave the main sequence.\n", "  We study the dynamics of cosmological perturbations in models of dark matter\nbased on ultralight coherent vector fields. Very much as for scalar field dark\nmatter, we find two different regimes in the evolution: for modes with $k^2\\ll\n{\\cal H}ma$, we have a particle-like behaviour indistinguishable from cold dark\nmatter, whereas for modes with $k^2\\gg {\\cal H}ma$, we get a wave-like\nbehaviour in which the sound speed is non-vanishing and of order $c_s^2\\simeq\nk^2/m^2a^2$. This implies that, also in these models, structure formation could\nbe suppressed on small scales. However, unlike the scalar case, the fact that\nthe background evolution contains a non-vanishing homogeneous vector field\nimplies that, in general, the evolution of the three kinds of perturbations\n(scalar, vector and tensor) can no longer be decoupled at the linear level.\nMore specifically, in the particle regime, the three types of perturbations are\nactually decoupled, whereas in the wave regime, the three vector field\nperturbations generate one scalar-tensor and two vector-tensor perturbations in\nthe metric. Also in the wave regime, we find that a non-vanishing anisotropic\nstress is present in the perturbed energy-momentum tensor giving rise to a\ngravitational slip of order $(\\Phi-\\Psi)/\\Phi\\sim c_s^2$. Moreover in this\nregime the amplitude of the tensor to scalar ratio of the scalar-tensor modes\nis also $h/\\Phi\\sim c_s^2$. This implies that small-scale density perturbations\nare necessarily associated to the presence of gravity waves in this model. We\ncompare their spectrum with the sensitivity of present and future gravity waves\ndetectors.\n", "  We propose a non-minimally coupled gravity model in $ Y(R)F^2 $ form to\ndescribe the radiation fluid stars which have the radiative equation of state\nbetween the energy density $ \\rho $ and the pressure $p$ as $\\rho=3p $. Here\n$F^2$ is the Maxwell invariant and $Y(R)$ is a function of the Ricci scalar\n$R$. We give the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations in\ndifferential form notation taking the infinitesimal variations of the model. We\nlook for electrically charged star solutions to the field equations under a\nconstraint which eliminating complexity of the higher order terms in the field\nequations. We determine the non-minimally coupled function $Y(R)$ and the\ncorresponding model which admits new exact solutions in the interior of star\nand Reissner-Nordstrom solution at the exterior region. Using vanishing\npressure condition at the boundary together with the continuity conditions of\nthe metric functions and the electric charge, we find the mass-radius ratio,\ncharge-radius ratio and gravitational surface redshift depending on the\nparameter of the model for the radiation fluid star. We derive general\nrestrictions for the ratios and redshift of the charged compact stars. We\nobtain a slightly smaller upper mass-radius ratio limit than the Buchdahl bound\n$ 4/9 $ and a smaller upper redshift limit than the bound of the standard\nGeneral Relativistic stars.\n", "  We study scattering amplitudes in two-dimensional string theory on a black\nhole bakground. We start with a simple derivation of the\nFateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (FZZ) duality, which associates correlation\nfunctions of the sine-Liouville integrable model on the Riemann sphere to\ntree-level string amplitudes on the Euclidean two-dimensional black hole. This\nderivation of FZZ duality is based on perturbation theory, and it relies on a\ntrick originally due to Fateev, which involves duality relations between\ndifferent Selberg type integrals. This enables us to rewrite the correlation\nfunctions of sine-Liouville theory in terms of a special set of correlators in\nthe gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) theory, and use this to perform further\nconsistency checks of the recently conjectured Generalized FZZ (GFZZ) duality.\nIn particular, we prove that n-point correlation functions in sine-Liouville\ntheory involving n-2 winding modes actually coincide with the correlation\nfunctions in the SL(2,R)/U(1) gauged WZW model that include n-2 oscillator\noperators of the type described by Giveon, Itzhaki and Kutasov in reference\narXiv:1603.05822. This proves the GFZZ duality for the case of tree level\nmaximally winding violating n-point amplitudes with arbitrary $n$. We also\ncomment on the connection between GFZZ and other marginal deformations\npreviously considered in the literature.\n", "  Aims. INTEGRAL has been monitoring the Galactic center region for more than a\ndecade. Over this time INTEGRAL has detected hundreds of type-I X-ray bursts\nfrom the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1728-34, a.k.a. \"the slow\nburster\". Our aim is to study the connection between the persistent X-ray\nspectra and the X-ray burst spectra in a broad spectral range. Methods. We\nperformed spectral modeling of the persistent emission and the X-ray burst\nemission of 4U 1728-34 using data from the INTEGRAL JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI\ninstruments. Results. We constructed a hardness intensity diagram to track\nspectral state variations. In the soft state the energy spectra are\ncharacterized by two thermal components - likely from the accretion disc and\nthe boundary/spreading layer - together with a weak hard X-ray tail that we\ndetect in 4U 1728-34 for the first time in the 40 to 80 keV range. In the hard\nstate the source is detected up to 200 keV and the spectrum can be described by\na thermal Comptonization model plus an additional component: either a powerlaw\ntail or reflection. By stacking 123 X-ray bursts in the hard state, we detect\nemission up to 80 keV during the X-ray bursts. We find that during the bursts\nthe emission above 40 keV decreases by a factor of about three with respect to\nthe persistent emission level. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the\nenhanced X-ray burst emission changes the spectral properties of the accretion\ndisc in the hard state. The likely cause is an X-ray burst induced cooling of\nthe electrons in the inner hot flow near the neutron star.\n", "  We present a comprehensive experimental analysis of statistical properties of\nthe self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) free-electron laser (FEL) FLASH\nat DESY in Hamburg by means of Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry.\nThe experiments were performed at the FEL wavelengths of 5.5 nm, 13.4 nm, and\n20.8 nm. We determined the 2-nd order intensity correlation function for all\nwavelengths and different operation conditions of FLASH. In all experiments a\nhigh degree of spatial coherence (above 50%) was obtained. Our analysis\nperformed in spatial and spectral domains provided us with the independent\nmeasurements of an average pulse duration of the FEL that were below 60 fs. To\nexplain complicated behaviour of the 2-nd order intensity correlation function\nwe developed advanced theoretical model that includes the presence of multiple\nbeams and external positional jitter of the FEL pulses. By this analysis we\ndetermined that in most experiments several beams were present in radiating\nfield and in one of the experiments external positional jitter was about 25% of\nthe beam size. We envision that methods developed in our study will be used\nwidely for analysis and diagnostics of the FEL radiation.\n", "  A SYK--like model close to the colored tensor models has recently been\nproposed \\cite{Witten:2016iux}. Building on results obtained in tensor models\n\\cite{GurSch}, we discuss the complete $1/N$ expansion of the model. We detail\nthe two and four point functions at leading order. The leading order two point\nfunction is a sum over melonic graphs, and the leading order relevant four\npoint functions are sums over dressed ladder diagrams. We then show that any\norder in the $1/N$ series of the two point function can be written solely in\nterm of the leading order two and four point functions. The full $1/N$\nexpansion of arbitrary correlations can be obtained by similar methods.\n", "  We aim to develop the Orion B Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) as a local template\nfor interpreting extra-galactic molecular line observations. We use the\nwide-band receiver at the IRAM-30m to spatially and spectrally resolve the\nOrion B GMC. The observations cover almost 1 square degree at 26\" resolution\nwith a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the\nmapped spectral lines are the 12CO, 13CO, C18O, C17O, HCN, HNC, 12CN, CCH,\nHCO+, N2H+ (1-0), and 12CS, 32SO, SiO, c-C3H2, CH3OH (2-1) transitions. We\nintroduce the molecular anatomy of the Orion B GMC, including relations between\nline intensities and gas column density or far-UV radiation fields, and\ncorrelations between selected line and line ratios. We also obtain a\ndust-traced gas mass that is less than about one third the CO-traced mass,\nusing the standard Xco conversion factor. The presence of overluminous CO can\nbe traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. In\nfact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and\nCCH are the most sensitive. Moreover dense cloud cores are almost exclusively\ntraced by N2H+. Other traditional high density tracers, such as HCN (1-0), are\nalso easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of\nabout 500 H2 cm-3. In general, we find no straightforward relation between line\ncritical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas\nregions. Our initial findings demonstrate that the relations between line\n(ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often\nassumed. Sensitivity (i.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and\nabove all chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions.\nThey must be considered together when developing the next generation of\nextra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature and\nradiation field.\n", "  The derivation of the phase transition in the model of Ga\\'zdzicki and\nGorenstein is generalized and simplified by using a geometrical construction.\n", "  In specific kinematics, hard exclusive amplitudes may be factorized into a\nshort distance dominated part computable in a perturbative way on the one hand,\nand universal, confinement related hadronic matrix elements on the other hand.\nThe extension of this description to processes such as backward meson\nelectroproduction and forward meson production in antiproton-nucleon scattering\nleads to define new hadronic matrix elements of three quark operators on the\nlight cone, the nucleon-to-meson transition distribution amplitudes, which shed\na new light on the nucleon structure.\n", "  We propose a laboratory experience aimed at undergraduate physics students to\nunderstand the main features of the photoelectric effect and to perform a\nmeasurement of the ratio h/e, where h is the Planck's constant and e is the\nelectron charge. The experience is based on the method developed by Millikan\nfor his measurements on the photoelectric effect in the years from 1912 to\n1915. The experimental setup consists of a photomultiplier tube (PMT) equipped\nwith a voltage divider properly modified to set variable retarding potentials\nbetween the photocathode and the first dynode, and a set of LEDs emitting at\ndifferent wavelengths. The photocathode is illuminated with the various LEDs\nand, for each wavelength of the incident light, the output anode current is\nmeasured as a function of the retarding potential applied between the cathode\nand the first dynode. From each measurement, a value of the stopping potential\nfor the anode current is derived. Finally, the stopping potentials are plotted\nas a function of the frequency of the incident light, and a linear fit is\nperformed. The slope and the intercept of the line allow respectively to\nevaluate the ratio h/e and the ratio W/e, where W is the work function of the\nphotocathode.\n", "  We consider a chain of atoms that are bound together by a harmonic force.\nSpin-1/2 electrons that move between neighboring chain sites (H\\\"uckel model)\ninduce a lattice dimerization at half band filling (Peierls effect). We\nsupplement the H\\\"uckel model with a local Hubbard interaction and a long-range\nOhno potential, and calculate the average bond-length, dimerization, and\noptical phonon frequencies for finite straight and zig-zag chains using the\ndensity-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. We check our numerical\napproach against analytic results for the H\\\"uckel model. The Hubbard\ninteraction mildly affects the average bond length but substantially enhances\nthe dimerization and increases the optical phonon frequencies whereas, for\nmoderate Coulomb parameters, the long-range Ohno interaction plays no role.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the absolute branching fraction for\n$\\Lambda^+_{c}\\rightarrow \\Lambda \\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}$. This measurement is based on\na sample of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data at a center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=4.6$ GeV collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage\nrings. The sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 567 pb$^{-1}$. The\nbranching fraction is determined to be $\\mathcal B({\\Lambda^+_c\\rightarrow\n\\Lambda \\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}})=(3.49\\pm0.46({\\rm stat})\\pm0.27({\\rm syst}))\\%$. In\naddition, we calculate the ratio $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda^+_c\\rightarrow \\Lambda\n\\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu})/\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda^+_c\\rightarrow \\Lambda e^+\\nu_{e})$ to be\n$0.96\\pm0.16({\\rm stat})\\pm0.04({\\rm syst})$.\n", "  Modern Astrophysics is based on multi-wavelength data organized into large\nand heterogeneous catalogues. Hence, the need for efficient, reliable and\nscalable catalogue cross-matching methods plays a crucial role in the era of\nthe petabyte scale. Furthermore, multi-band data have often very different\nangular resolution, requiring the highest generality of cross-matching\nfeatures, mainly in terms of region shape and resolution. In this work we\npresent $C^{3}$ (Command-line Catalogue Cross-match), a multi-platform\napplication designed to efficiently cross-match massive catalogues. It is based\non a multi-core parallel processing paradigm and conceived to be executed as a\nstand-alone command-line process or integrated within any generic data\nreduction/analysis pipeline, providing the maximum flexibility to the end-user,\nin terms of portability, parameter configuration, catalogue formats, angular\nresolution, region shapes, coordinate units and cross-matching types. Using\nreal data, extracted from public surveys, we discuss the cross-matching\ncapabilities and computing time efficiency also through a direct comparison\nwith some publicly available tools, chosen among the most used within the\ncommunity, and representative of different interface paradigms. We verified\nthat the $C^{3}$ tool has excellent capabilities to perform an efficient and\nreliable cross-matching between large datasets. Although the elliptical\ncross-match and the parametric handling of angular orientation and offset are\nknown concepts in the astrophysical context, their availability in the\npresented command-line tool makes $C^{3}$ competitive in the context of public\nastronomical tools.\n", "  The \"B fields in OB stars\" (BOB) collaboration is based on an ESO Large\nProgramme, to study the occurrence rate, properties, and ultimately the origin\nof magnetic fields in massive stars.\n  In the framework of this programme, we carried out low-resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations of a large sample of massive stars using FORS2\ninstalled at the ESO VLT 8-m telescope.\n  We determined the magnetic field values with two completely independent\nreduction and analysis pipelines. Our in-depth study of the magnetic field\nmeasurements shows that differences between our two pipelines are usually well\nwithin 3sigma errors. From the 32 observations of 28 OB stars, we were able to\nmonitor the magnetic fields in CPD-57 3509 and HD164492C, confirm the magnetic\nfield in HD54879, and detect a magnetic field in CPD-62 2124. We obtain a\nmagnetic field detection rate of 6+-3% for the full sample of 69 OB stars\nobserved with FORS2 within the BOB programme. For the pre-selected objects with\na v sin i below 60 km/s, we obtain a magnetic field detection rate of 5+-5%. We\nalso discuss X-ray properties and multiplicity of the objects in our FORS2\nsample with respect to the magnetic field detections.\n", "  The quantum teleportation plays an important role in quantum information\nprocess, in this sense, the quantum entanglement properties involving an\ninfinite chain structure is quite remarkable because real materials could be\nwell represented by an infinite chain. We study the teleportation of an\nentangled state through a couple of quantum channels, composed by Heisenberg\ndimers in an infinite Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain, the couple of chains are\nconsidered sufciently far away from each other to be ignored the any\ninteraction between them . To teleporting a couple of qubits through the\nquantum channel, we need to find the average density operator for Heisenberg\nspin dimers, which will be used as quantum channels. Assuming the input state\nas a pure state, we can apply the concept of fidelity as a useful measurement\nof teleportation performance of a quantum channel. Using the standard\nteleportation protocol, we have derived an analytical expression for the output\nconcurrence, fidelity, and average fidelity. We study in detail the effects of\ncoupling parameters, external magnetic field and temperature dependence of\nquantum teleportation. Finally, we explore the relations between entanglement\nof the quantum channel, the output entanglement and the average fidelity of the\nsystem. Through a kind of phase diagram as a function of Ising-Heisenberg\ndiamond chain model parameters, we illustrate where the quantum teleportation\nwill succeed and a region where the quantum teleportation could fail.\n", "  We discuss the formulation of the scattering asymptotic condition in a\nrelativistic quantum theory formulated in terms of reflection positive\nEuclidean Green functions.\n", "  The OLYMPUS collaboration reports on a precision measurement of the\npositron-proton to electron-proton elastic cross section ratio, $R_{2\\gamma}$,\na direct measure of the contribution of hard two-photon exchange to the elastic\ncross section. In the OLYMPUS measurement, 2.01~GeV electron and positron beams\nwere directed through a hydrogen gas target internal to the DORIS storage ring\nat DESY. A toroidal magnetic spectrometer instrumented with drift chambers and\ntime-of-flight scintillators detected elastically scattered leptons in\ncoincidence with recoiling protons over a scattering angle range of $\\approx\n20\\degree$ to $80\\degree$. The relative luminosity between the two beam species\nwas monitored using tracking telescopes of interleaved GEM and MWPC detectors\nat $12\\degree$, as well as symmetric M{\\o}ller/Bhabha calorimeters at\n$1.29\\degree$. A total integrated luminosity of 4.5~fb$^{-1}$ was collected. In\nthe extraction of $R_{2\\gamma}$, radiative effects were taken into account\nusing a Monte Carlo generator to simulate the convolutions of internal\nbremsstrahlung with experiment-specific conditions such as detector acceptance\nand reconstruction efficiency. The resulting values of $R_{2\\gamma}$, presented\nhere for a wide range of virtual photon polarization $0.456<\\epsilon<0.978$,\nare smaller than some hadronic two-photon exchange calculations predict, but\nare in reasonable agreement with a subtracted dispersion model and a\nphenomenological fit to the form factor data.\n", "  In this paper we consider double parton distribution functions (dPDFs) which\nare the main non perturbative ingredients appearing in the double parton\nscattering cross section formula in hadronic collisions. By using recent\ncalculation of dPDFs by means of constituent quark models within the so called\nLight-Front approach, we investigate the role of relativistic effects on dPDFs.\nWe find, in particular, that the so called Melosh operators, which allow to\nproperly convert the LF spin into the canonical one and incorporate a proper\ntreatment of boosts, produce sizeable effects on dPDFs. We discuss specific\npartonic correlations induced by these operators in transverse plane which are\nrelevant to the proton structure and study under which conditions these results\nare stable against variations in the choice of the proton wave function.\n", "  Regulation of electronic structure and mobility cut-on rate in\ntwo-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted much\nattention because of its potential in electronic device design. The anisotropic\nRaman scattering and mobility cut-on rate of monolayer unique distorted-1T(1Td)\nReS2 with external strain are determined theoretically based on the density\nfunction theory. The angle-dependent Raman spectrum of Ag-like, Eg-like and Cp\nmodels are used to discriminate and analysis structural anisotropy; the strain\nis exploited to adjust the structural symmetry and electronic structure of ReS2\nso as to enhance mobility cut-on rate to almost 6 times of the original value.\nOur results suggest the use of the strain engineering in high-quality\nsemiconductor switch device.\n", "  Silicon detectors based on the HV-CMOS technology are being investigated as\npossible candidate for the outer layers of the ATLAS pixel detector for the\nHigh Luminosity LHC. In this framework the H35Demo ASIC has been produced in\nthe 350 nm AMS technology (H35). The H35Demo chip has a large area ($18.49\n\\times 24.40 \\, \\mathrm{mm^2}$) and includes four different pixel matrices and\nthree test structures. In this paper the radiation hardness properties, in\nparticular the evolution of the depletion region with fluence is studied using\nedge-TCT on test structures. Measurements on the test structures from chips\nwith different substrate resistivity are shown for non irradiated and\nirradiated devices up to a cumulative fluence of $2 \\cdot 10^{15} \\,\n\\mathrm{1\\,MeV\\, n_{eq} / cm^{2}}$.\n", "  We present a generalization of the standard In\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner contraction by\nrescaling not only the generators of a Lie superalgebra but also the arbitrary\nconstants appearing in the components of the invariant tensor. The procedure\npresented here allows to obtain explicitly the Chern-Simons supergravity action\nof a contracted superalgebra. In particular we show that the Poincar\\'e limit\ncan be performed to a $D=2+1$ $\\left(p,q\\right) $ $% AdS$ Chern-Simons\nsupergravity in presence of the exotic form. We also construct a new\nthree-dimensional $\\left(2,0\\right) $ Maxwell Chern-Simons supergravity theory\nas a particular limit of $\\left(2,0\\right) $ $AdS$ -Lorentz supergravity\ntheory. The generalization for $\\mathcal{N}=p+q$ gravitini is also considered.\n", "  We study the spreading of correlations after a local quench in a\nnon-relativistic quantum field theory. We focus on noninteracting\nnon-relativistic fermions and study the time evolution after two identical\nsystems in their ground states are suddenly joined together with a localized\nimpurity at the junction. We find that, even if the quasi-particles of the\nsystem have unbounded dispersion, the correlations show light cone effects. We\ncarry out a detailed study of these effects by developing an accurate\nasymptotic expansion of the two-point function and determining exactly the\ndensity of particles at any time after the quench. In particular, we find that\nthe width of the light cone region is $\\propto t^{1/2}$. The structure of\ncorrelations, however, does not show a pure light cone form - \"superluminal\ncorrections\" are much larger than in the bounded-dispersion case. These\nfindings can be explained by inspecting the structure of excitations generated\nby the initial state. We show that a similar picture also emerges in the\npresence of a harmonic trapping potential and when more than two systems are\nsuddenly joined at a single point.\n", "  A new light gauge boson $U$ may have both vector and axial couplings. In a\nlarge class of theories however, the new $U(1)$ current $J^\\mu_F$ naturally\ncombines with the weak neutral current $J^\\mu_{Z_{\\rm sm}}$, both\nparity-violating, into a vectorial current $J^\\mu_U$, combination of the\n$B,\\,L$ and electromagnetic currents with a possible dark matter current.\n  $U^\\mu $ may be expressed equivalently as $\\cos\\xi \\,C^\\mu\\! + \\sin \\xi\n\\,Z^\\mu_{\\rm \\,sm}$ (\"mixing with the $Z$\") or $(1/\\cos\\chi) \\,\\hat\nC^\\mu+\\tan\\chi \\,A^\\mu$ (\"mixing with the photon\"), with $\\hat C$ coupled to\n$B,\\,L$ and dark matter. The $U$ boson may be viewed as a generalized dark\nphoton, coupled to SM particles through $Q_U=Q+\\lambda_B B+\\lambda_i L_i$, with\nstrength $\\,g\"\\cos\\xi\\,\\cos^2\\theta=e\\tan\\chi$. \"Kinetic mixing\" terms, gauge\ninvariant or not, simply correspond to a description in a non-orthogonal field\nbasis (rather than to a new physical effect), with the dark photon in general\nalso coupled to $B$ and $L$.\n  In a grand-unified theory $\\,Q_U^{\\rm gut}=Q-2\\,(B-L)\\,$ at the GUT scale for\nSM particles, invariant under the $SU(4)$ electrostrong symmetry group, with a\nnon-vanishing $\\epsilon = \\tan\\chi$ already present at the GUT scale, leading\nto $Q_U\\simeq \\,Q-1.64\\, (B-L)\\,$ at low energy. This also applies, for a very\nlight or massless $U$ boson, to a new long-range force, which could show up\nthrough apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle.\n", "  Hot, million degree gas appears to pervade the Milky way halo, containing a\nlarge fraction of the Galactic missing baryons. This circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) is probed effectively in X-rays, both in absorption and in emission. The\nCGM also appears to be anisotropic, so we have started a program to determine\nCGM properties along several sightlines by combining absorption and emission\nmeasurements. Here we present the emission measure close to the \\mrk509\nsightline using new \\suzaku and \\xmm observations. We also present new analysis\nand modeling of \\chandra HETG spectra to constrain the absorption parameters.\nThe emission measure in this sightline is high,\nEM$=0.0165\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0006~$cm$^{-6}~$pc, five times larger than the average.\nThe observed \\ovii column density N(\\ovii)$= 2.35\\pm0.4 \\times\n10^{16}$cm$^{-2}$, however, is close to the average. We find that the\ntemperature of the emitting and absorbing gas is the same: $\\log T (\\rm K) =\n6.33\\pm0.01$ and $\\log T (\\rm K)=6.33\\pm0.16$ respectively. We fit the observed\ncolumn density and emission measure with a $\\beta-$model density profile. The\nthe central density is constrained to be between $n_0=2.8$--$6.0\\times 10^{-4}$\ncm$^{-3}$ and the core radius of the density profile has a lower limit of 40\nkpc. This shows that the hot gas is mostly in the CGM of the galaxy, not in the\nGalactic disk. Our derived density profile is close to the \\citet{Maller2004}\nprofile for adiabatic gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with an NFW dark matter\npotential well. Assuming this density profile, the minimum mass of the hot CGM\nis $3.2 \\times 10^{10}~$M$_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The non-Abelian symmetries of the half-infinite XXZ spin chain for all\npossible types of integrable boundary conditions are classified. For each type\nof boundary conditions, an analog of the Chevalley-type presentation is given\nfor the corresponding symmetry algebra. In particular, two new algebras arise\nthat are, respectively, generated by the symmetry operators of the model with\ntriangular and special $U_q(gl_2)-$invariant integrable boundary conditions.\n", "  Heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and the LHC have found a new emergent\nphase of QCD, a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) that is\ndistinctively different from either the low temperature hadron phase or the\nvery high temperature weakly coupled plasma phase. Highly nontrivial emergent\nphenomena occur in such sQGP and two examples will be discussed in this\ncontribution: the magnetic component of sQGP that stems from topologically\nnontrivial configurations in the gluon sector; and the anomalous chiral\ntransport that arises as macroscopic manifestation of microscopic chiral\nanomaly in the quark sector. For both examples, their important roles in\nexplaining pertinent heavy-ion data will be emphasized.\n", "  We use a mass complete (log($M/M_{\\odot}$) $\\geqslant$ 9.6) sample of\ngalaxies with accurate photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field to construct\nthe density field and the cosmic web to $z$=1.2. The comic web extraction\nrelies on the density field Hessian matrix and breaks the density field into\nclusters, filaments and the field. We provide the density field and cosmic web\nmeasures to the community. We show that at $z$ $\\lesssim$ 0.8, the median\nstar-formation rate (SFR) in the cosmic web gradually declines from the field\nto clusters and this decline is especially sharp for satellites ($\\sim$ 1 dex\nvs. $\\sim$ 0.5 dex for centrals). However, at $z$ $\\gtrsim$ 0.8, the trend\nflattens out for the overall galaxy population and satellites. For star-forming\ngalaxies only, the median SFR is constant at $z$ $\\gtrsim$ 0.5 but declines by\n$\\sim$ 0.3-0.4 dex from the field to clusters for satellites and centrals at\n$z$ $\\lesssim$ 0.5. We argue that for satellites, the main role of the cosmic\nweb environment is to control their star-forming fraction, whereas for\ncentrals, it is mainly to control their overall SFR at $z$ $\\lesssim$ 0.5 and\nto set their fraction at $z$ $\\gtrsim$ 0.5. We suggest that most satellites\nexperience a rapid quenching mechanism as they fall from the field into\nclusters through filaments, whereas centrals mostly undergo a slow\nenvironmental quenching at $z$ $\\lesssim$ 0.5 and a fast mechanism at higher\nredshifts. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of the large-scale\ncosmic web on galaxy evolution.\n", "  We present a study of quasar selection using the DES supernova fields. We\nused a quasar catalog from an overlapping portion of the SDSS Stripe 82 region\nto quantify the completeness and efficiency of selection methods involving\ncolor, probabilistic modeling, variability, and combinations of\ncolor/probabilistic modeling with variability. We only considered objects that\nappear as point sources in the DES images. We examine color selection methods\nbased on the WISE mid-IR W1-W2 color, a mixture of WISE and DES colors (g-i and\ni-W1) and a mixture of VHS and DES colors (g-i and i-K). For probabilistic\nquasar selection, we used XDQSOz, an algorithm that employs an empirical\nmulti-wavelength flux model of quasars to assign quasar probabilities. Our\nvariability selection uses the multi-band chi2-probability that sources are\nconstant in the DES Year 1 griz-band light curves. The completeness and\nefficiency are calculated relative to an underlying sample of point sources\nthat are detected in the required selection bands and pass our data quality and\nphotometric error cuts. We conduct our analyses at two magnitude limits, i<19.8\nmag and i<22 mag. For sources with W1 and W2 detections, the W1-W2 color or\nXDQSOz method combined with variability gives the highest completenesses of\n>85% for both i-band magnitude limits and efficiencies of >80% to the bright\nlimit and >60% to the faint limit; however, the giW1 and giW1+variability\nmethods give the highest quasar surface densities. The XDQSOz method and\ncombinations of W1W2/giW1/XDQSOz with variability are among the better\nselection methods when both high completeness and high efficiency are desired.\nWe also present the OzDES Quasar Catalog of 1,263 spectroscopically-confirmed\nquasars taken by the OzDES survey. The catalog includes quasars with redshifts\nup to z~4 and brighter than i=22 mag, although the catalog is not complete up\nthis magnitude limit.\n", "  CoRoT 223992193 is the only known low-mass, pre-main sequence eclipsing\nbinary that shows evidence of a circumbinary disk. The system displays complex\nphotometric and spectroscopic variability over a range of timescales and\nwavelengths. Using two optical CoRoT runs, and infrared Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5\n$\\mu$m observations (simultaneous with the second CoRoT run), we model the\nout-of-eclipse light curves. The large scale structure in both CoRoT light\ncurves is consistent with the constructive and destructive interference of\nstarspot signals at two slightly different periods. Using the stellar $v\\sin i$\n's, we infer different rotation periods: the primary is consistent with\nsynchronisation and the secondary is slightly supersynchronous. Comparison of\nthe raw data to the residuals of our spot model in colour-magnitude space\nindicates additional contributions consistent with variable dust emission and\nobscuration. We also identify short-duration flux dips preceding secondary\neclipse in all three CoRoT and Spitzer bands. We construct a model of the inner\nregions of the binary and propose that these dips could be caused by partial\noccultation of the central binary by the accretion stream onto the primary\nstar. Analysis of 15 VLT/FLAMES H$\\alpha$ profiles reveal an emission profile\nassociated with each star: the majority is consistent with chromospheric\nemission but higher velocity emission is also seen, which could be due to\nprominences or accretion-related phenomena. In addition, simultaneous u and\nr-band observations from CFHT/MEGACam reveal a short-lived u-band excess\nconsistent with either an accretion hot spot or stellar flare. The photometric\nand spectroscopic variations are complex but are consistent with the picture of\ntwo active stars possibly undergoing non-steady, low-level accretion; the\nsystem's very high inclination provides a new view of such variability.\n[Abridged]\n", "  The two-photon-exchange (TPE) contribution in $ep\\rightarrow ep\\pi ^0$ with\n$W=M_{\\Delta}$ and small $Q^2$ is calculated and its corrections to the ratios\nof electromagnetic transition form factors $R_{EM} =\nE_{1+}^{(3/2)}/M_{1+}^{(3/2)} $ and $R_{SM} = S_{1+}^{(3/2)}/M_{1+}^{(3/2)}$,\nare analysed. A simple hadronic model is used to estimate the TPE amplitude.\nTwo phenomenological models, MAID2007 and SAID, are used to approximate the\nfull $ep\\rightarrow ep\\pi ^0$ cross sections which contain both the TPE and the\none-photon-exchange (OPE) contributions. The genuine the OPE amplitude is then\nextracted from an integral equation by iteration. We find that the TPE\ncontribution is not sensitive to whether MAID or SAID is used as input in the\nregion with $Q^2<2$ GeV$^2$.\n  It gives small correction to $R_{EM}$ while for $R_{SM}$, the correction is\nabout -10\\% at small $\\epsilon$ and about $1\\%$ at large $\\epsilon$ for\n$Q^2\\approx2.5$ GeV$^2$. The large correction from TPE at small $\\epsilon$ must\nbe included in the analysis to get a reliable extraction of $R_{SM}$.\n", "  We propose a nonperturbative framework to study general correlation functions\nof single-trace operators in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\nat large $N$. The basic strategy is to decompose them into fundamental building\nblocks called the hexagon form factors, which were introduced earlier to study\nstructure constants using integrability. The decomposition is akin to a\ntriangulation of a Riemann surface, and we thus call it hexagonalization. We\npropose a set of rules to glue the hexagons together based on symmetry, which\nnaturally incorporate the dependence on the conformal and the R-symmetry cross\nratios. Our method is conceptually different from the conventional operator\nproduct expansion and automatically takes into account multi-trace operators\nexchanged in OPE channels. To illustrate the idea in simple set-ups, we compute\nfour-point functions of BPS operators of arbitrary lengths and correlation\nfunctions of one Konishi operator and three short BPS operators, all at one\nloop. In all cases, the results are in perfect agreement with the perturbative\ndata. We also suggest that our method can be a useful tool to study conformal\nintegrals, and show it explicitly for the case of ladder integrals.\n", "  Holography for UV-incomplete gauge theories is important but poorly\nunderstood. A paradigmatic example is $d=4$, $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills\ncoupled to $N_f$ quark flavors, which possesses a Landau pole at a UV scale\n$\\Lambda_{LP}$. The dual gravity solution exhibits a UV singularity at a finite\nproper distance along the holographic direction. Despite this, holographic\nrenormalization can be fully implemented via analytic continuation to an AdS\nsolution. The presence of a UV cut-off manifests itself in several interesting\nways. At energies $E \\ll \\Lambda_{LP}$ no pathologies appear, as expected from\neffective field theory. In contrast, at scales $E \\lesssim \\Lambda_{LP}$ the\ngravitational potential becomes repulsive, and at temperatures $T \\lesssim\n\\Lambda_{LP}$ the specific heat becomes negative. Although we focus on\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills with flavor, our qualitative results apply to\na much more general class of theories, since they only depend on the fact that\nthe metric near the UV singularity is a hyper-scaling violating metric with\nexponent $\\theta > d-1$.\n", "  We compute next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the process $gg\\to ZH$.\nIn the effective-theory approach we confirm the results in the literature. We\nconsider top quark mass corrections via an asymptotic expansion and show that\nthere is a good convergence below the top quark threshold which describes\napproximately {\\num a quarter} of the total cross section. Our corrections are\nimplemented in the publicly available {\\tt C++} program {\\tt ggzh}.\n", "  The observed galactic 511 keV line has been interpreted in a number of papers\nas a possible signal of dark matter annihilation within the galactic bulge. If\nthis is the case then we should expect a similar spectral feature associated\nwith nearby dwarf galaxies which are dark matter dominated. It has recently\nbeen argued [1] that the absence of such a signal excludes a dark matter\nexplanation as the major source for the galactic 511 keV line. In the model\npresented here dark matter in the form of heavy quark nuggets produces the\ngalactic 511 keV emission line through interactions with the visible matter. It\nis argued, however, that this type of interaction is not subject to the strong\ndark matter annihilation constraints presented in [1].\n", "  We study the possibility to probe the unpolarized and linearly polarized\ntransverse momentum- dependent gluon distributions in unpolarized pp collision\nin charmonium and bottomonium produc- tion, employing non-relativistic QCD\n(NRQCD) based color octet model within transverse momentum dependent (TMD)\nfactorization framework. The transverse momentum (p T ) and rapidity\ndistributions of J/{\\psi} and {\\Upsilon}(1S) at LHCb, RHIC and AFTER energies\nare estimated. Significant modulations in transverse momentum spectrum of\nquarkonium in the low p T region is obtained when contributions of linearly\npolarized gluons inside an unpolarized proton are taken into account. The\nresults of quarko- nium production in color octet model and color evaporation\nmodel are compared.\n", "  The conversion efficiency of electric microwave signals into surface acoustic\nwaves in different types of superconducting transducers is studied with the aim\nof quantum applications. We compare delay lines containing either conventional\nsymmetric transducers (IDTs) or unidirectional transducers (UDTs) at 2.3 GHz\nand 10 mK. The UDT delay lines improve the insertion loss with 4.7 dB and a\ndirectivity of 22 dB is found for each UDT, indicating that 99.4 % of the\nacoustic power goes in the desired direction. The power lost in the undesired\ndirection accounts for more than 90 % of the total loss in IDT delay lines, but\nonly ~3 % percent of the total loss in the FEUDT delay lines.\n", "  Coupled cluster and symmetry projected Hartree-Fock are two central paradigms\nin electronic structure theory. However, they are very different. Single\nreference coupled cluster is highly successful for treating weakly correlated\nsystems, but fails under strong correlation unless one sacrifices good quantum\nnumbers and works with broken-symmetry wave functions, which is unphysical for\nfinite systems. Symmetry projection is effective for the treatment of strong\ncorrelation at the mean-field level through multireference non-orthogonal\nconfiguration interaction wavefunctions, but unlike coupled cluster, it is\nneither size extensive nor ideal for treating dynamic correlation. We here\nexamine different scenarios for merging these two dissimilar theories. We carry\nout this exercise over the integrable Lipkin model Hamiltonian, which despite\nits simplicity, encompasses non-trivial physics for degenerate systems and can\nbe solved via diagonalization for a very large number of particles. We show how\nsymmetry projection and coupled cluster doubles individually fail over\ndifferent correlation limits, whereas models that merge these two theories are\nhighly successful over the entire phase diagram. Despite the simplicity of the\nLipkin Hamiltonian, the lessons learned in this work will be useful for\nbuilding an ab initio symmetry projected coupled cluster theory that we expect\nto be accurate over the weakly and strongly correlated limits, as well as the\nrecoupling regime.\n", "  Previous determinations of the oxygen isotopic ratios in AGB carbon stars\nwere at odds with the existing theoretical predictions. We aim to redetermine\nthe oxygen ratios in these stars using new spectral analysis tools and further\ndevelop discussions on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in order to\nelucidate this problem. Oxygen isotopic ratios were derived from spectra in the\nK-band in a sample of galactic AGB carbon stars of different spectral types and\nnear solar metallicity. Synthetic spectra calculated in LTE with spherical\ncarbon-rich atmosphere models and updated molecular line lists were used. The\nCNO isotope ratios derived in a homogeneous way, were compared with theoretical\npredictions for low-mass (1.5-3 M_o) AGB stars computed with the FUNS code\nassuming extra mixing both during the RGB and AGB phases. For most of the stars\nthe 16O/17O/18O ratios derived are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions confirming that, for AGB stars, are established using the values\nreached after the FDU according to the initial stellar mass. This fact, as far\nas the oxygen isotopic ratios are concerned, leaves little space for the\noperation of any extra mixing mechanism during the AGB phase. Nevertheless, for\na few stars with large 16O/17O/18O, the operation of such a mechanism might be\nrequired, although their observed 12C/13C and 14N/15N ratios would be difficult\nto reconcile within this scenario. Furthermore, J-type stars tend to have lower\n16O/17O ratios than the normal carbon stars, as already indicated in previous\nstudies. Excluding these peculiar stars, AGB carbon stars occupy the same\nregion as pre-solar type I oxide grains in a 17O/16O vs. 18O/16O diagram,\nshowing little spread. This reinforces the idea that these grains were probably\nformed in low-mass stars during the previous O-rich phases.\n", "  We propose the method for identifying many particle electronic states in the\nsystem of coupled quantum dots (impurities) with Coulomb correlations. We\ndemonstrate that different electronic states can be distinguished by the\ncomplex analysis of localized charge dynamics and non-stationary\ncharacteristics. We show that localized charge time evolution strongly depends\non the properties of initial state and analyze different time scales in charge\nkinetics for initially prepared singlet and triplet states. We reveal the\nconditions for existence of charge trapping effects governed by the selection\nrules for electron transitions between the states with different occupation\nnumbers.\n", "  SN 2016gkg is a nearby Type IIb supernova discovered shortly after explosion.\nLike several other Type IIb events with early-time data, SN 2016gkg displays a\ndouble-peaked light curve, with the first peak associated with the cooling of a\nlow-mass extended progenitor envelope. We present unprecedented\nintranight-cadence multi-band photometric coverage of the first light-curve\npeak of SN 2016gkg obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope\nnetwork, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, the Swift satellite\nand various amateur-operated telescopes. Fitting these data to analytical\nshock-cooling models gives a progenitor radius of ~25-140 solar radii with\n~2-30 x 10^-2 solar masses of material in the extended envelope (depending on\nthe model and the assumed host-galaxy extinction). Our radius estimates are\nbroadly consistent with values derived independently (in other works) from HST\nimaging of the progenitor star. However, the shock-cooling model radii are on\nthe lower end of the values indicated by pre-explosion imaging. Hydrodynamical\nsimulations could refine the progenitor parameters deduced from the\nshock-cooling emission and test the analytical models.\n", "  While galaxies with clockwise and counterclockwise handedness are visually\ndifferent, they are expected to be symmetric in all of their other\ncharacteristics. Previous experiments using both manual analysis and machine\nvision have shown that the handedness of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\ngalaxies can be predicted with accuracy significantly higher than mere chance\nusing its photometric data alone, showing that SDSS photometry pipeline is\nsensitive to the handedness of the galaxy. However, some of these previous\nexperiments were based on manually classified galaxies, and the results may\ntherefore be subjected to bias originated from the human perception. This paper\ndescribes an experiment based on a set of 162,514 celestial objects classified\nas clockwise and counterclockwise spiral galaxies in a fully automatic process,\nshowing that the source of the asymmetry is more than the human perception\nbias. The results are compared to two smaller datasets, and confirm the\nobservation that the handedness of SDSS galaxies can be predicted by their\nphotometric information, and show that the position angle of counterclockwise\ngalaxies computed by SDSS photometry pipeline is consistently higher than the\nposition angle computed for galaxies with clockwise patterns. The experiment\nalso shows statistically significant differences in the measured magnitude,\naccording which galaxies with clockwise patterns are brighter than galaxies\nwith counterclockwise patterns. The magnitude of that difference changes across\nRA ranges, and exhibits a strong correlation with the cosine of the right\nascension.\n", "  This is the first of a series of detailed papers on string amplitudes with\nhighly excited strings (HES). In the present paper we construct a generating\nfunction for string amplitudes with generic HES vertex operators using a\nfixed-loop momentum formalism. We generalise the proof of the chiral splitting\ntheorem of D'Hoker and Phong to string amplitudes with arbitrary HES vertex\noperators (with generic KK and winding charges, polarisation tensors and\noscillators) in general toroidal compactifications\n$\\mathcal{E}=\\mathbb{R}^{D-1,1}\\times \\mathbb{T}^{D_{\\rm cr}-D}$ (with generic\nconstant K\\\"ahler and complex structure target space moduli, background\nKaluza-Klein (KK) gauge fields and torsion). We adopt a novel approach that\ndoes not rely on a \"reverse engineering\" method to make explicit the loop\nmomenta, thus avoiding a certain ambiguity pointed out in a recent paper by\nSen, while also keeping the genus of the worldsheet generic. This approach will\nalso be useful in discussions of quantum gravity and in particular in relation\nto black holes in string theory, non-locality and breakdown of local effective\nfield theory, as well as in discussions of cosmic superstrings and their\nphenomenological relevance. We also discuss the manifestation of wave/particle\n(or rather wave/string) duality in string theory.\n", "  We explain a method to find internal quark configurations of exotic hadron\ncandidates by using the constituent counting rule. The counting rule was\ntheoretically predicted in perturbative QCD for hard exclusive hadron\nreactions, and it has been tested in experiments for stable hadrons including\ncompound systems of hadrons such as the deuteron, $^3$H, and $^3$He. It\nindicates that the cross section scales as $d\\sigma /dt \\sim 1/s^{n-2}$, where\n$s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared and $n$ is the total number of\nconstituents. We apply this method for finding internal configurations of\nexotic hadron candidates, especially $\\Lambda (1405)$. There is a possibility\nthat $\\Lambda (1405)$ could be five-quark state or a $\\bar K N$ molecule, and\nscaling properties should be different between the ordinary three-quark state\nor five-quark one. We predict such a difference in $\\pi^- + p \\to K^0 + \\Lambda\n(1405)$, and it could be experimentally tested, for example, at J-PARC. On the\nother hand, there are already measurements for $\\gamma + p \\to K^+ + \\Lambda\n(1405)$ as well as the ground $\\Lambda$ in photoproduction reactions. Analyzing\nsuch data, we found an interesting indication that $\\Lambda (1405)$ looks like\na five-quark state at medium energies and a three-quark one at high energies.\nHowever, accurate higher-energy measurements are necessary for drawing a solid\nconclusion, and it should be done at JLab by using the updated 12 GeV electron\nbeam. Furthermore, we discuss studies of exotic hadron candidates, such as $f_0\n(980)$ and $a_0 (980)$, in electron-positron annihilation by using generalized\ndistribution amplitudes and the counting rule. These studies should be possible\nas a KEKB experiment.\n", "  Light scattering in a magnetic medium with uncorrelated inclusions is\ntheoretically studied in the approximation of ladder diagram. Correlation\nbetween polarizations of electromagnetic waves that are produced by\ninfinitely-distant dipole source is considered. Here white noise disorder model\nwith Gaussian distribution is taken into account. In such a medium the\nmagneto-optical interaction leads to correlation between perpendicular light\npolarizations. Spatial field correlation matrix with nonzero nondiagonal\nelements is obtained in the first order on gyration.\n", "  We use a chiral interaction at N3LO in the 1S0 channel of the nucleon-\nnucleon interaction in order to investigate the on-shell transition along the\nsimilarity renormalization group flow towards the infrared limit. We find a\ncrossover at a scale that depends on the number of grid points used to\ndiscretise the momentum space.\n", "  We consider quantum phase-space dynamics using Wigner's representation of\nquantum mechanics. We stress the usefulness of the integral form for the\ndescription of Wigner's phase-space current~$\\bm J$ as an alternative to the\npopular Moyal bracket. The integral form brings out the symmetries between\nmomentum and position representations of quantum mechanics, is numerically\nstable, and allows us to perform some calculations using elementary integrals\ninstead of Groenewold star products. Our central result is an explicit,\nelementary proof which shows that only systems up to quadratic in their\npotential fulfill Liouville's theorem of volume preservation in quantum\nmechanics. Contrary to a recent suggestion, our proof shows that the\nnon-Liouvillian character of quantum phase-space dynamics cannot be transformed\naway.\n", "  Properties of \\r{ho}-meson in symmetric nuclear matter are investigated\nwithin a light-front constituent quark model (LFCQM), using the in-medium input\ncalculated by the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model. The LFCQM used here was\npreviously applied in vacuum to calculate the \\r{ho}-meson electromagnetic\nproperties, namely, charge G 0 , magnetic G 1 , and quadrupole G 2 form\nfactors, as well as the electromagnetic radius and decay constant. We predict\nthe in-medium modifications of the \\r{ho}-meson electromagnetic form factors in\nsymmetric nuclear matter.\n", "  We derive the secular evolution of the orbital elements of a stellar-mass\nobject orbiting a spinning massive black hole. We use the post-Newtonian\napproximation in harmonic coordinates, with test-body equations of motion for\nthe conservative dynamics that are valid through 3PN order, including\nspin-orbit, quadrupole and (spin)$^2$ effects, and with radiation-reaction\ncontributions linear in the mass of the body that are valid through 4.5PN\norder, including the 4PN damping effects of spin-orbit coupling. The evolution\nequations for the osculating orbit elements are iterated to high PN orders\nusing a two-timescale approach and averaging over orbital timescales. We derive\na criterion for terminating the orbit when its Carter constant drops below a\ncritical value, whereupon the body plunges across the event horizon at the next\nclosest approach. The results are valid for arbitrary eccentricities and\narbitrary inclinations. We then analyze numerically the orbits of objects\ninjected into high-eccentricity orbits via interactions within a surrounding\nstar cluster, obtaining the number of orbits and the elapsed time between\ninjection and plunge, and the residual orbital eccentricity at plunge as a\nfunction of inclination. We derive an analytic approximation for the time to\nplunge in terms of initial orbital variables. We show that, if the black hole\nis spinning rapidly, the flux of gravitational radiation during the final orbit\nbefore plunge may be suppressed by as much as three orders of magnitude if the\norbit is retrograde on the equatorial plane compared to its prograde\ncounterpart.\n", "  The experimental findings reported in our original paper [1]\n(arXiv:1211.2913) have been criticized in ref.[2] (arXiv:1606.00710). We\nbelieve that the arguments brought in ref. [2] are not correct and we show\nevidence for this.\n", "  A non-relativistic quantum model is considered with a point particle carrying\na charge $e$ and moving on the plane pierced by two infinitesimally thin\nAharonov-Bohm solenoids and subjected to a perpendicular uniform magnetic field\nof magnitude $B$. Relying on a technique due to Schulman and Sunada which is\napplicable to Schr\\\"odinger operators on multiply connected configuration\nmanifolds a formula is derived for the corresponding heat kernel. As an\napplication of the heat kernel formula, an approximate asymptotic expressions\nare derived for the lowest eigenvalue lying above the first Landau level and\nfor the corresponding eigenfunction while assuming that $|eB|R^{2}/(\\hbar c)$\nis large where $R$ is the distance between the two solenoids.\n", "  We show that with suitable choices of parametrization, gauge fixing and\ncutoff, the anomalous variation of the effective action under global rescalings\nof the background metric is identical to the derivative with respect to the\ncutoff, i.e. to the beta functional, as defined by the exact RG equation. The\nWard identity and the RG equation can be combined, resulting in a modified flow\nequation that is manifestly invariant under global background rescalings.\n", "  Baryonic matter is notoriously difficult to deal with in the large-N limit,\nas baryons become operators of very large dimension with N fields in the\nfundamental representation. This issue is also present in gauge/gravity duals\nas baryons are described by very heavy localized objects. There are however\nalternative large-N extrapolations of QCD where small baryonic operators exist\nand can be treated on an equal footing to mesons. We explore the possibility of\nturning on a finite density of \"light\" baryons in a theory with a hadronic mass\ngap using a gauge/gravity construction based on the D3/D7 intersection. We find\na novel phase with spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry at zero temperature.\n", "  The monopole formula provides the Hilbert series of the Coulomb branch for a\n3-dimensional N=4 gauge theory. Employing the concept of a fan defined by the\nmatter content, and summing over the corresponding collection of monoids,\nallows the following: firstly, we provide explicit expressions for the Hilbert\nseries for any gauge group. Secondly, we prove that the order of the pole at\nt=1 and t=infinity equals the complex or quaternionic dimension of the moduli\nspace, respectively. Thirdly, we determine all bare and dressed BPS monopole\noperators that are sufficient to generate the entire chiral ring. As an\napplication, we demonstrate the implementation of our approach to computer\nalgebra programs and the applicability to higher rank gauge theories.\n", "  We study closed-string moduli stabilization in Higgs-otic inflation in Type\nIIB orientifold backgrounds with fluxes. In this setup large-field inflation is\ndriven by the vacuum energy of mobile D7-branes. Imaginary selfdual (ISD)\nthree-form fluxes in the background source a $\\mu$-term and the necessary\nmonodromy for large field excursions while imaginary anti-selfdual (IASD)\nthree-form fluxes are sourced by non-perturbative contributions to the\nsuperpotential necessary for moduli stabilization. We analyze K\\\"ahler moduli\nstabilization and backreaction on the inflaton potential in detail. Confirming\nresults in the recent literature, we find that integrating out heavy K\\\"ahler\nmoduli leads to a controlled flattening of the inflaton potential. We quantify\nthe flux tuning necessary for stability even during large-field inflation.\nMoreover, we study the backreaction of supersymmetrically stabilized complex\nstructure moduli and the axio-dilaton in the K\\\"ahler metric of the inflaton.\nContrary to previous findings, this backreaction can be pushed far out in field\nspace if a similar flux tuning as in the K\\\"ahler sector is possible. This\nallows for a trans-Planckian field range large enough to support inflation.\n", "  Recently, LHCb collaboration reported the observation of two hidden-charmed\nresonances $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ consistent with hidden-charmed\npentaquarks. We perform a dynamical investigation about the\n$\\bar{D}\\Sigma_c^*(2520)$ and $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$ interactions which are\ndescribed by the meson exchanges in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation\napproach. Two poles around $4450$ and $4390$ MeV are produced from the\n$\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$ interaction with spin parities $3/2^-$ and $5/2^+$,\nrespectively. The peak for $5/2^+$ state has a comparable hight as that of\n$3/2^-$ state in the $J/\\psi p$ invariant mass spectrum. Another bound state\nwith spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$ is produced from the $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^*_c(2520)$\ninteraction. Such results suggest that the narrower LHCb pentaquark $P_c(4450)$\ncan be well interpreted as a $5/2^+$ $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$ molecular state\nwhile the $P_c(4380)$ is a $3/2^-$ $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$ molecular state\nmixed with other secondary origins.\n", "  Fluctuations of conserved quantities such as baryon number (B), electric\ncharge number (Q), and strangeness number (S), are sensitive to the correlation\nlength and can be used to probe non-gaussian fluctuations near the critical\npoint. Experimentally, higher moments of the multiplicity distributions have\nbeen used to search for the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. In this\npaper, we report the efficiency-corrected cumulants and their ratios of mid-\nrapidity (|y| < 0.5) net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at\n7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV collected in 2010, 2011, and\n2014 with STAR at RHIC. The centrality and energy dependence of the cumulants\nand their ratios, are presented. Furthermore, the comparisons with baseline\ncalculations (Poisson) and non-critical-point models (UrQMD) are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Aims. The magnetic star HD148937 is the only Galactic Of?p star surrounded by\na nebula. The structure of this nebula is particularly complex and is composed,\nfrom the center out outwards, of a close bipolar ejecta nebula (NGC6164/5), an\nellipsoidal wind-blown shell, and a spherically symmetric Stromgren sphere. The\nexact formation process of this nebula and its precise relation to the star's\nevolution remain unknown. Methods. We analyzed infrared Spitzer IRS and\nfar-infrared Herschel/PACS observations of the NGC6164/5 nebula. The Herschel\nimaging allowed us to constrain the global morphology of the nebula. We also\ncombined the infrared spectra with optical spectra of the central star to\nconstrain its evolutionary status. We used these data to derive the abundances\nin the ejected material. To relate this information to the evolutionary status\nof the star, we also determined the fundamental parameters of HD148937 using\nthe CMFGEN atmosphere code. Results. The H$\\alpha$ image displays a bipolar or\n\"8\"-shaped ionized nebula, whilst the infrared images show dust to be more\nconcentrated around the central object. We determine nebular abundance ratios\nof N/O = 1.06 close to the star, and N/O = 1.54 in the bright lobe constituting\nNGC6164. Interestingly, the parts of the nebula located further from HD148937\nappear more enriched in stellar material than the part located closer to the\nstar. Evolutionary tracks suggest that these ejecta have occured $\\sim$1.2-1.3\nand $\\sim$0.6 Myrs ago, respectively. In addition, we derive abundances of\nargon for the nebula compatible with the solar values and we find a depletion\nof neon and sulfur. The combined analyses of the known kinematics and of the\nnew abundances of the nebula suggest either a helical morphology for the\nnebula, possibly linked to the magnetic geometry, or the occurrence of a binary\nmerger.\n", "  Neutrino-electron scattering is a purely leptonic fundamental interaction and\ntherefore provides an important channel to test the Standard Model, especially\nat the low energy-momentum transfer regime. We derived constraints on neutrino\nnonstardard interaction couplings depending on model-independent approaches\nwhich are described by a four-Fermi pointlike interaction and unparticle\nphysics model with tensorial components. Data on $\\bar{\\nu}_{e}-e$ and\n$\\nu_{e}-e$ scattering from the TEXONO and LSND experiments, respectively, are\nused. The upper limits and the allowed regions of scalar, pseudoscalar, and\ntensorial nonstandard interaction couplings of neutrinos are derived at 90\\%\nconfidence level in both one-parameter and two-parameter analysis. New upper\nlimits for tensorial unparticle physics coupling constants and mass parameters\nare also placed.\n", "  An updated determination is presented of the electric and magnetic form\nfactors of the proton, in the framework of a dual-model realization of QCD in\nthe limit of an infinite number of colors. Very good agreement with data is\nobtained in the space-like region up to $ q^2 \\simeq - \\,30 \\,{GeV}^2$. In\nparticular, the ratio $\\mu_P \\, G_E(q^2) / G_M(q^2)$ is predicted in very good\nagreement with recoil polarization measurements from Jefferson Lab, up to $q^2\n\\simeq - 8.5 \\,{GeV}^2$. \\end{abstract}\n", "  The renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP),\ndeveloped as a nonperturbative tool for constructing bound states in quantum\nfield theories, is applied to QCD. The approach stems from the similarity\nrenormalization group and introduces the concept of effective particles. It has\nbeen shown that the RGPEP passes the test of exhibiting asymptotic freedom. We\npresent the running of the Hamiltonian coupling with the renormalization-group\nscale and summarize the basic elements needed in the formulation of the\nbound-state problem.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the origin of the peak structure around the\n$K^{-} p p$ threshold observed in the in-flight ${}^{3}\\text{He} ( K^{-} , \\,\n\\Lambda p ) n$ reaction in the recent E15 experiment at J-PARC. For this\npurpose, we consider two scenarios to produce the peak. One is that the\n$\\Lambda (1405)$ is generated but it does not correlate with $p$, and the\nuncorrelated $\\Lambda (1405) p$ system subsequently decays into $\\Lambda p$.\nThe other one is that the $\\bar{K} N N$ bound state is indeed generated and\ndecays into $\\Lambda p$. As a result, the experimental signal is qualitatively\nwell reproduced in the $\\bar{K} N N$ bound scenario, definitely discarding the\nuncorrelated $\\Lambda (1405) p$ one.\n", "  We present new (3+1) dimensional numerical relativity simulations of the\nbinary neutron star (BNS) mergers that take into account the NS spins. We\nconsider different spin configurations, aligned or antialigned to the orbital\nangular momentum, for equal and unequal mass BNS and for two equations of\nstate. All the simulations employ quasiequilibrium circular initial data in the\nconstant rotational velocity approach, i.e. they are consistent with Einstein\nequations and in hydrodynamical equilibrium. We study the NS rotation effect on\nthe energetics, the gravitational waves (GWs) and on the possible\nelectromagnetic (EM) emission associated to dynamical mass ejecta. For\ndimensionless spin magnitudes of $\\chi\\sim0.1$ we find that spin-orbit\ninteractions and also spin-induced-quadrupole deformations affect the\nlate-inspiral-merger dynamics. The latter is, however, dominated by finite-size\neffects. Spin (tidal) effects contribute to GW phase differences up to 5 (20)\nradians accumulated during the last eight orbits to merger. Similarly, after\nmerger the collapse time of the remnant and the GW spectrogram are affected by\nthe NSs rotation. Spin effects in dynamical ejecta are clearly observed in\nunequal mass systems in which mass ejection originates from the tidal tail of\nthe companion. Consequently kilonovae and other EM counterparts are affected by\nspins. We find that spin aligned to the orbital angular momentum leads to\nbrighter EM counterparts than antialigned spin with luminosities up to a factor\nof two higher.\n", "  We consider the discrete time dynamics of an ensemble of fermionic quantum\nwalkers moving on a finite discrete sample, interacting with a reservoir of\ninfinitely many quantum particles on the one dimensional lattice. The reservoir\nis given by a fermionic quasifree state, with free discrete dynamics given by\nthe shift, whereas the free dynamics of the non-interacting quantum walkers in\nthe sample is defined by means of a unitary matrix. The reservoir and the\nsample exchange particles at specific sites by a unitary coupling and we study\nthe discrete dynamics of the coupled system defined by the iteration of the\nfree discrete dynamics acting on the unitary coupling, in a variety of\nsituations. In particular, in absence of correlation within the particles of\nthe reservoir and under natural assumptions on the sample's dynamics, we prove\nthat the one- and two-body reduced density matrices of the sample admit large\ntimes limits characterized by the state of the reservoir which are independent\nof the free dynamics of the quantum walkers and of the coupling strength.\nMoreover, the corresponding asymptotic density profile in the sample is flat\nand the correlations of number operators have no structure, a manifestation of\nthermalization.\n", "  We compute the three-loop QCD corrections to the massive\nquark-anti-quark-photon form factors $F_1$ and $F_2$ in the large-$N_c$ limit.\nThe analytic results are expressed in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. This\nallows for a straightforward numerical evaluation. We also derive series\nexpansions, including power suppressed terms, for three kinematic regions\ncorresponding to small and large invariant masses of the photon momentum, and\nsmall velocities of the heavy quarks.\n", "  The local entropy of a nonequilibrium system of independent fermions is\ninvestigated, and analyzed in the context of the laws of thermodynamics. It is\nshown that the local temperature and chemical potential can only be expressed\nin terms of derivatives of the local entropy for linear deviations from local\nequilibrium. The first law of thermodynamics is shown to lead to an inequality,\nnot an equality, for the change in the local entropy as the nonequilibrium\nstate of the system is changed. The maximum entropy principle (second law of\nthermodynamics) is proven: a nonequilibrium distribution has a local entropy\nless than or equal to a local equilibrium distribution satisfying the same\nconstraints. It is shown that the local entropy of the system tends to zero\nwhen the local temperature tends to zero, consistent with the third law of\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations have become a vital tool for\npredictive quality atomistic understanding of complex surface chemical reaction\nkinetics over a wide range of reaction conditions. In order to expand their\npractical value in terms of giving guidelines for atomic level design of\ncatalytic systems, it is very desirable to readily evaluate a sensitivity\nanalysis for a given model. The result of such a sensitivity analysis\nquantitatively expresses the dependency of the turnover frequency, being the\nmain output variable, on the rate constants entering the model. In the past the\napplication of sensitivity analysis, such as Degree of Rate Control, has been\nhampered by its exuberant computational effort required to accurately sample\nnumerical derivatives of a property that is obtained from a stochastic\nsimulation method. In this study we present an efficient and robust three stage\napproach that is capable of reliably evaluating the sensitivity measures for\nstiff microkinetic models as we demonstrate using CO oxidation on RuO2(110) as\na prototypical reaction. In a first step, we utilize the Fisher Information\nMatrix for filtering out elementary processes which only yield negligible\nsensitivity. Then we employ an estimator based on linear response theory for\ncalculating the sensitivity measure for non-critical conditions which covers\nthe majority of cases. Finally we adopt a method for sampling coupled finite\ndifferences for evaluating the sensitivity measure of lattice based models.\nThis allows efficient evaluation even in critical regions near a second order\nphase transition that are hitherto difficult to control. The combined approach\nleads to significant computational savings over straightforward numerical\nderivatives and should aid in accelerating the nano scale design of\nheterogeneous catalysts.\n", "  We present an analytic and numerical study of the creation of an\nuni-directional spin-wave emission in ultra-thin ferromagnetic films sandwiched\nin an asymmetric layer stack. For this we extend the analytical description of\nspin waves in spin-wave waveguides by the incorporation of the influence of the\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the spin-wave propagation. By\nexploring the model system Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Pt we show that it is possible to\nachieve an uni-directional spin-wave emission by combining wave-vector\nselective excitation sources with the frequency splitting which arises from\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Hereby we focus on device\nfeature sizes and spin-wave wavelengths compatible with state-of-the art\nexcitation and detection schemes. We demonstrate that the optimum operation\nconditions for the non-reciprocal emission can be predicted using the presented\nanalytical formalism\n", "  In the last few years several dualities were found between the low-energy\nbehaviors of Chern-Simons-matter theories with unitary gauge groups coupled to\nscalars, and similar theories coupled to fermions. In this paper we generalize\nthose dualities to orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. In particular, we\nconjecture dualities between $SO(N)_k$ Chern-Simons theories coupled to $N_f$\nreal scalars in the fundamental representation, and $SO(k)_{-N+N_f/2}$ coupled\nto $N_f$ real (Majorana) fermions in the fundamental. For $N_f=0$ these are\njust level-rank dualities of pure Chern-Simons theories, whose precise form we\nclarify. They lead us to propose new gapped boundary states of topological\ninsulators and superconductors. For $k=1$ we get an interesting low-energy\nduality between $N_f$ free Majorana fermions and an $SO(N)_1$ Chern-Simons\ntheory coupled to $N_f$ scalar fields (with $N_f \\leq N-2$).\n", "  Large area surveys with a high number of galaxies observed have undoubtedly\nmarked a milestone in the understanding of several properties of galaxies, such\nas star-formation history, morphology, and metallicity. However, in many cases,\nthese surveys provide fluxes from fixed small apertures (e.g. fibre), which\ncover a scant fraction of the galaxy, compelling us to use aperture corrections\nto study the global properties of galaxies. In this work, we derive the current\ntotal star formation rate (SFR) of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) star-forming\ngalaxies, using an empirically based aperture correction of the measured $\\rm\nH\\alpha$ flux for the first time, thus minimising the uncertainties associated\nwith reduced apertures. All the $\\rm H\\alpha$ fluxes have been\nextinction-corrected using the $\\rm H\\alpha/H\\beta$ ratio free from aperture\neffects. The total SFR for $\\sim$210,000 SDSS star-forming galaxies has been\nderived applying pure empirical $\\rm H\\alpha$ and $\\rm H\\alpha/H\\beta$ aperture\ncorrections based on the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey.\nWe find that, on average, the aperture-corrected SFR is $\\sim$0.65dex higher\nthan the SDSS fibre-based SFR. The relation between the SFR and stellar mass\nfor SDSS star-forming galaxies (SFR--$\\rm M_\\star$) has been obtained, together\nwith its dependence on extinction and $\\rm H\\alpha$ equivalent width. We\ncompare our results with those obtained in previous works and examine the\nbehaviour of the derived SFR in six redshift bins, over the redshift range $\\rm\n0.005 \\leq z\\leq 0.22$. The SFR--$\\rm M_\\star$ sequence derived here is in\nagreement with selected observational studies based on integral field\nspectroscopy of individual galaxies as well as with the predictions of recent\ntheoretical models of disc galaxies.\n", "  Probing the trajectory of a transiting planet across the disk of its star\nthrough the analysis of its Rossiter-McLaughlin effect can be used to measure\nthe differential rotation of the host star and the true obliquity of the\nsystem. Highly misaligned systems could be particularly conducive to these\nmesurements, which is why we reanalysed the HARPS transit spectra of WASP-8b\nusing the 'Rossiter-McLaughlin effect reloaded' (reloaded RM) technique. This\napproach allows us to isolate the local stellar CCF emitted by the\nplanet-occulted regions. As a result we identified a $\\sim$35% variation in the\nlocal CCF contrast along the transit chord, which might trace a deepening of\nthe stellar lines from the equator to the poles. Whatever its origin, such an\neffect cannot be detected when analyzing the RV centroids of the\ndisk-integrated CCFs through a traditional velocimetric analysis of the RM\neffect. Consequently it injected a significant bias into the results obtained\nby Queloz et al. (2010) for the projected rotational velocity $v_{eq} \\sin\ni_{\\star}$ (1.59$\\stackrel{+0.08}{_{-0.09}}$ km/s) and the sky-projected\nobliquity $\\lambda$ (-123.0$\\stackrel{+3.4}{_{-4.4}}^{\\circ}$). Using our\ntechnique, we measured these values to be $v_{eq} \\sin i_{\\star}$ =\n1.90$\\pm$0.05 km/s and $\\lambda$ = -143.0$\\stackrel{+1.6}{_{-1.5}}^{\\circ}$. We\nfound no compelling evidence for differential rotation of the star, although\nthere are hints that WASP-8 is pointing away from us with the stellar poles\nrotating about 25% slower than the equator. Measurements at higher accuracy\nduring ingress/egress will be required to confirm this result. In contrast to\nthe traditional analysis of the RM effect, the reloaded RM technique directly\nextracts the local stellar CCFs, allowing us to analyze their shape and to\nmeasure their RV centroids, unbiased by variations in their contrast or FWHM.\n", "  In this short article we develop recent proposals to relate Yang-Baxter\nsigma-models and non-abelian T-duality. We demonstrate explicitly that the\nholographic space-times associated to both\n(multi-parameter)-$\\beta$-deformations and non-commutative deformations of\n${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills gauge theory including the RR fluxes can be\nobtained via the machinery of non-abelian T-duality in Type II supergravity.\n", "  We study the world-sheet conformal field theories for T-folds systematically\nbased on the Lie algebra lattices representing the momenta of strings. The\nfixed point condition required for the T-duality twist restricts the possible\nLie algebras. When the T-duality acts as a simple chiral reflection, one is\nleft with the four cases, $A_1, D_{2r}, E_7, E_8$, among the simple\nsimply-laced algebras. From the corresponding Englert-Neveu lattices, we\nconstruct the modular invariant partition functions for the T-fold CFTs in\nbosonic string theory. Similar construction is possible also by using Euclidean\neven self-dual lattices. We then apply our formulation to the T-folds in the\n$E_8 \\times E_8$ heterotic string theory. Incorporating non-trivial phases for\nthe T-duality twist, we obtain, as simple examples, a class of modular\ninvariant partition functions parametrized by three integers. Our construction\nincludes the cases which are not reduced to the free fermion construction.\n", "  Embedding QCD into the standard model breaks various symmetries of QCD\nexplicitly, especially C and P. While these effects are usually perturbatively\nsmall, they can be amplified in extreme environments like merging neutron stars\nor by the interplay with new physics. To correctly treat these cases requires\nfully backcoupled calculations. To pave the way for later investigations of\nhadronic physics, we study the QCD quark propagator coupled to an explicit\nbreaking. This substantially increases the tensor structure even for this\nsimplest correlation function. To cope with the symmetry structure, and\ncovering all possible quark masses, from the top quark mass to the chiral\nlimit, we employ Dyson-Schwinger equations. While at weak breaking the\nqualitative effects have similar trends as in perturbation theory, even\nmoderately strong breakings lead to qualitatively different effects,\nnon-linearly amplified by the strong interactions.\n", "  We calculate the polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons in Au-Au collisions at\nRHIC Beam Energy Scan range $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=7.7, \\dots, 200$ GeV in a\nstate-of-the-art 3+1 dimensional cascade + viscous hydro model vHLLE+UrQMD. We\nfind that the polarization of $\\Lambda$ in the out-of-plane direction decreases\nsubstantially with collision energy. We explore the connection between the\npolarization signal and thermal vorticity and discuss the feed-down and\nhadronic rescattering effects on the mean polarization of all produced\n$\\Lambda$ hyperons.\n", "  We give a systematic derivation of the local expressions of the NS H-flux,\ngeometric F- as well as non-geometric Q- and R-fluxes in terms of bivector\nbeta- and two-form B-potentials including vielbeins. They are obtained using a\nsupergeometric method on QP-manifolds by twist of the standard Courant\nalgebroid on the generalized tangent space without flux. Bianchi identities of\nthe fluxes are easily deduced. We extend the discussion to the case of the\ndouble space and present a formulation of T-duality in terms of canonical\ntransformations between graded symplectic manifolds. Finally, the construction\nis compared to the formerly introduced Poisson Courant algebroid, a Courant\nalgebroid on a Poisson manifold, as a model for R-flux.\n", "  Non-equilibrium corrections to the distribution functions of quarks and\ngluons in a hot and dense QCD medium modify the \"hard thermal loops\" (HTL). The\nHTLs determine the retarded, advanced, and symmetric (time-ordered) propagators\nfor gluons with soft momenta as well as the Debye screening and Landau damping\nmass scales. We compute such corrections to a thermal as well as to a\nnon-thermal fixed point.The screening and damping mass scales are sensitive to\nthe bulk pressure and hence to (pseudo-) critical dynamical scaling of the bulk\nviscosity in the vicinity of a second-order critical point. This could be\nreflected in the properties of quarkonium bound states in the deconfined phase\nand in the dynamics of soft gluon fields.\n", "  We first discuss a large set of evolutionary calculations of close binaries\nwith a B-type primary at birth and with a period such that the Roche lobe\noverflow starts during the core hydrogen burning phase of the primary\n(intermediate mass and massive case A binaries). The evolution of both\ncomponents is followed simultaneously allowing us to check for the occurrence\nof contact binaries. We consider various models to treat a contact system and\nthe influence of these models on the predicted Algol-type system population is\ninvestigated. We critically discuss the available observations of Algol-type\nbinaries with a B-type primary at birth. Comparing these observations with the\npredictions allows us to put constraints on the contact star physics. We find\nthat mass transfer in Algols is most probably not conservative, that contact\nduring this phase does not necessarily lead to a merger, and that angular\nmomentum loss must be moderate.\n", "  We construct a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action coupled to a two-form field in\nfour dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Our superconformal formulation\nof the action shows a universal way to construct it in various Poincar\\'e\nsupergravity formulations. We generalize the DBI action to that coupled to\nmatter sector. We also discuss duality transformations of the DBI action, which\nare useful for phenomenological and cosmological applications.\n", "  Context. It is now generally accepted that the near-infrared excess of Herbig\nAeBe stars originates in the dust of a circumstellar disk. Aims. The aims of\nthis article are to infer the radial and vertical structure of these disks at\nscales of order one au, and the properties of the dust grains. Methods. The\nprogram objects (51 in total) were observed with the H-band (1.6micron)\nPIONIER/VLTI interferometer. The largest baselines allowed us to resolve (at\nleast partially) structures of a few tenths of an au at typical distances of a\nfew hundred parsecs. Dedicated UBVRIJHK photometric measurements were also\nobtained. Spectral and 2D geometrical parameters are extracted via fits of a\nfew simple models: ellipsoids and broadened rings with azimuthal modulation.\nModel bias is mitigated by parallel fits of physical disk models. Sample\nstatistics were evaluated against similar statistics for the physical disk\nmodels to infer properties of the sample objects as a group. Results. We find\nthat dust at the inner rim of the disk has a sublimation temperature\nTsub~1800K. A ring morphology is confirmed for approximately half the resolved\nobjects; these rings are wide delta_r>=0.5. A wide ring favors a rim that, on\nthe star-facing side, looks more like a knife edge than a doughnut. The data\nare also compatible with a the combination of a narrow ring and an inner disk\nof unspecified nature inside the dust sublimation radius. The disk inner part\nhas a thickness z/r~0.2, flaring to z/r~0.5 in the outer part. We confirm the\nknown luminosity-radius relation; a simple physical model is consistent with\nboth the mean luminosity-radius relation and the ring relative width; however,\na significant spread around the mean relation is present. In some of the\nobjects we find a halo component, fully resolved at the shortest interferometer\nspacing, that is related to the HAeBe class.\n", "  In order to study chromospheric magnetosonic wave propagation including, for\nthe first time, the effects of ion-neutral interactions in the partially\nionized solar chromosphere, we have developed a new multi-fluid computational\nmodel, accounting for ionization and recombination reactions in gravitationally\nstratified magnetized collisional media. The two-fluid model used in our 2D\nnumerical simulations treats neutrals as a separate fluid and considers charged\nspecies (electrons and ions) within the resistive MHD approach with Coulomb\ncollisions and anisotropic heat flux determined by Braginskii's transport\ncoefficients. The electromagnetic fields are evolved according to the full\nMaxwell equations and the solenoidality of the magnetic field is enforced with\na hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme. The initial density and temperature\nprofiles are similar to VAL III chromospheric model in which dynamical, thermal\nand chemical equilibrium are considered to ensure comparison to existing MHD\nmodels and avoid artificial numerical heating. In this initial setup we include\nsimple homogeneous flux tube magnetic field configuration and an external\nphotospheric velocity driver to simulate the propagation of MHD waves in the\npartially ionized reactive chromosphere. In particular, we investigate the loss\nof chemical equilibrium and the plasma heating related to the steepening of\nfast magnetosonic wave fronts in the gravitationally stratified medium.\n", "  The temperature-pressure phase diagram of ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe\nincludes four phase transitions. They are between the paramagnetic and the\nferromagnetic states with the subsequent transition in the superconducting\nferromagnetic state and between the normal and the superconducting states after\nwhich has to occur the transition to the superconducting ferromagnetic state.\nHere we have developed the Landau theory description of the phase diagram and\nestablished the specific ordering arising at each type of transition.\n  The phase transitions to the ferromagnetic superconducting state are\ninevitably accompanied by the emergency of screening currents. The\ncorresponding magnetostatics considerations allow to establish the significant\ndifference between the transition from the ferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic\nsuperconducting state and the transition from the superconducting to the\nferromagnetic superconducting state.\n", "  Here we report the first evidence for a reversible phase change in an\nethanethiol ice prepared under astrochemical conditions. InfraRed (IR)\nspectroscopy was used to monitor the morphology of the ice using the S-H\nstretching vibration, a characteristic vibration of thiol molecules. The\ndeposited sample was able to switch between amorphous and crystalline phases\nrepeatedly under temperature cycles between 10 K and 130 K with subsequent loss\nof molecules in every phase change. Such an effect is dependent upon the\noriginal thickness of the ice. Further work on quantitative analysis is to be\ncarried out in due course whereas here we are reporting the first results\nobtained.\n", "  We investigate the general structure of mirror symmetry breaking in the Twin\nHiggs scenario. We show, using the IR effective theory, that a significant gain\nin fine tuning can be achieved if the symmetry is broken hardly. We emphasize\nthat weakly coupled UV completions can naturally accommodate this scenario. We\nanalyze SUSY UV completions and present a simple Twin SUSY model with a tuning\nof around 10% and colored superpartners as heavy as 2 TeV. The collider\nsignatures of general Twin SUSY models are discussed with a focus on the\nextended Higgs sectors.\n", "  We introduce a novel class of interaction-enabled topological crystalline\ninsulators in two- and three-dimensional electronic systems, which we call\n\"topological crystalline magnet.\" It is protected by the product of the\ntime-reversal symmetry $\\mathcal{T}$ and a mirror symmetry or a rotation\nsymmetry $\\mathcal{R}$. A topological crystalline magnet exhibits two\nintriguing features: (i) it cannot be adiabatically connected to any Slater\ninsulator and (ii) the edge state is robust against coupling electrons to the\nedge. These features are protected by the anomalous symmetry transformation\nproperty $(\\mathcal{R} \\mathcal{T})^2=-1$ of the edge state. An anisotropic\nresponse to the external magnetic field can be an experimental signature.\n", "  The superconducting proximity effect is probed experimentally in Josephson\njunctions fabricated with InAs nanowires contacted by Nb leads. Contact\ntransparencies $t \\sim 0.7$ are observed. The electronic phase coherence length\nat low temperatures exceeds the channel length. However, the elastic scattering\nlength is a few times shorter than the channel length. Electrical measurements\nreveal two regimes of quantum transport: (i) the Josephson regime,\ncharacterized by a dissipationless current up to $\\sim 100$ nA, and (ii) the\nquantum dot regime, characterized by the formation of Andreev Bound States\n(ABS) associated with spontaneous quantum dots inside the nanowire channel. In\nregime (i), the behaviour of the critical current $I_c$ versus an axial\nmagnetic field $B_{||}$ shows an unexpected modulation and persistence to\nfields $>2$ T. In the quantum dot regime, the ABS are modelled as the\ncurrent-biased solutions of an Anderson-type model. The applicability of\ndevices in both transport regimes to Majorana fermion experiments is discussed.\n", "  We present GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum well devices that can operate as both\nelectron-hole (e-h) and hole-hole (h-h) bilayers, with separating barriers as\nnarrow as 5 nm or 7.5 nm. With such narrow barriers, in the h-h configuration\nwe observe signs of magnetic-field-induced exciton condensation in the quantum\nHall bilayer regime. In the same devices we can study the zero-magnetic-field\ne-h and h-h bilayer states using Coulomb drag. Very strong e-h Coulomb drag\nresistivity (up to 10% of the single layer resistivity) is observed at liquid\nhelium temperatures, but no definite signs of exciton condensation are seen in\nthis case. Self-consistent calculations of the electron and hole wavefunctions\nshow this might be because the average interlayer separation is larger in the\ne-h case than the h-h case.\n", "  We report the first realization of molecular beam epitaxy grown strained GaN\nquantum well field-effect transistors on single-crystal bulk AlN substrates.\nThe fabricated double heterostructure FETs exhibit a two- dimensional electron\ngas (2DEG) density in excess of 2x10^13/cm2. Ohmic contacts to the 2DEG channel\nwere formed by n+ GaN MBE regrowth process, with a contact resistance of 0.13\nOhm-mm. Raman spectroscopy using the quantum well as an optical marker reveals\nthe strain in the quantum well, and strain relaxation in the regrown GaN\ncontacts. A 65-nm-long rectangular-gate device showed a record high DC drain\ncurrent drive of 2.0 A/mm and peak extrinsic transconductance of 250 mS/mm.\nSmall-signal RF performance of the device achieved current gain cutoff\nfrequency fT~120 GHz. The DC and RF performance demonstrate that bulk AlN\nsubstrates offer an attractive alternative platform for strained quantum well\nnitride transistors for future high-voltage and high-power microwave\napplications.\n", "  We investigate elastic periodic structures characterized by topologically\nnontrivial bandgaps supporting backscattering suppressed edge waves. These edge\nwaves are topologically protected and are obtained by breaking inversion\nsymmetry within the unit cell. Examples for discrete one and two-dimensional\nlattices elucidate the concept and illustrate parallels with the quantum valley\nHall effect. The concept is implemented on an elastic plate featuring an array\nof resonators arranged according to a hexagonal topology. The resulting\ncontinuous structures have non-trivial bandgaps supporting edge waves at the\ninterface between two media having different topological invariants. The\ntopological properties of the considered configurations are predicted by unit\ncell and finite strip dispersion analyses. Numerical simulations on finite\nstructures demonstrate edge wave propagation for excitation at frequencies\nbelonging to the bulk bandgaps. The considered plate configurations define a\nframework for the implementation of topological concepts on continuous elastic\nstructures of potential engineering relevance.\n", "  Constrained energy minimizations of a many-body Hamiltonian return energy\nlandscapes e(b) where b=<B> representes the average value(s) of one (or\nseveral) collective operator(s), B, in an \"optimized\" trial state Phi_b, and e\n= <H> is the average value of the Hamiltonian in this state Phi_b. It is\nnatural to consider the uncertainty, Delta e, given that Phi_b usually belongs\nto a restricted set of trial states. However, we demonstrate that the\nuncertainty, Delta b, must also be considered, acknowledging corrections to\ntheoretical models. We also find a link between fluctuations of collective\ncoordinates and convexity properties of energy surfaces.\n", "  In the case of using the higher derivative regularization we construct the\nsubtraction scheme which gives the NSVZ-like relation for the anomalous\ndimension of the photino mass in softly broken ${\\cal N}=1$ SQED with $N_f$\nflavors in all loops. The corresponding renormalization prescription is\ndetermined by simple boundary conditions imposed on the renormalization\nconstants. It allows fixing an arbitrariness of choosing finite counterterms in\nevery order of the perturbation theory in such a way that the renormalization\ngroup functions defined in terms of the renormalized coupling constant satisfy\nthe NSVZ-like relation.\n", "  Using 25 years of data from uninterrupted monitoring of stellar orbits in the\nGalactic Center, we present an update of the main results from this unique data\nset: A measurement of mass of and distance to SgrA*. Our progress is not only\ndue to the eight year increase in time base, but also due to the improved\ndefinition of the coordinate system. The star S2 continues to yield the best\nconstraints on the mass of and distance to SgrA*; the statistical errors of\n0.13 x 10^6 M_sun and 0.12 kpc have halved compared to the previous study. The\nS2 orbit fit is robust and does not need any prior information. Using\ncoordinate system priors, also the star S1 yields tight constraints on mass and\ndistance. For a combined orbit fit, we use 17 stars, which yields our current\nbest estimates for mass and distance: M = 4.28 +/- 0.10|stat. +/. 0.21|sys. x\n10^6 M_sun and R_0 = 8.32 +/- 0.07|stat. +/- 0.14|sys. kpc. These numbers are\nin agreement with the recent determination of R_0 from the statistical cluster\nparallax. The positions of the mass, of the near-infrared flares from SgrA* and\nof the radio source SgrA* agree to within 1mas. In total, we have determined\norbits for 40 stars so far, a sample which consists of 32 stars with randomly\noriented orbits and a thermal eccentricity distribution, plus eight stars for\nwhich we can explicitly show that they are members of the clockwise disk of\nyoung stars, and which have lower eccentricity orbits.\n", "  ADER-WENO methods have proved extremely useful in obtaining arbitrarily\nhigh-order solutions to problems involving hyperbolic systems of PDEs. For\nexample, it has been demonstrated that for the same computational cost as a\nRunge-Kutta scheme of a certain order, one can obtain an ADER scheme of one\nhigher order of accuracy. Additionally, Runge-Kutta schemes suffer from the\npresence of Butcher barriers, limiting the order of temporal accuracy that one\ncan comfortably achieve. There are no such limitations present in ADER-WENO\nschemes.\n  The cumbersome analytical derivation of the temporal derivatives of the\nsolution required by the original ADER formulation has been replaced by the use\nof a cell-wise local Galerkin predictor. The predictor can take either a\ndiscontinuous or a continuous form. The Galerkin predictor is a high-order\npolynomial reconstruction of the data in both space and time, found as the root\nof a non-linear system.\n  It has been conjectured that the eigenvalues of certain matrices appearing in\nthese non-linear systems are always zero, leading to desirable system\nproperties for certain classes of PDEs. It is proved here that this is in deed\nthe case for any number of spatial dimensions and any desired order of\naccuracy, for both the discontinuous and continuous Galerkin variants. This\nresult is independent of the choice of reconstruction basis polynomials.\n", "  Swimming microorganisms often have to propel in complex, non-Newtonian\nfluids. We carry out experiments with self-propelling helical swimmers driven\nby an externally rotating magnetic field in shear-thinning, inelastic fluids.\nSimilarly to swimming in a Newtonian fluid, we obtain for each fluid a\nlocomotion speed which scales linearly with the rotation frequency of the\nswimmer, but with a prefactor which depends on the power index of the fluid.\nThe fluid is seen to always increase the swimming speed of the helix, up to 50%\nfaster and thus the strongest of such type reported to date. The maximum\nrelative increase for a fluid power index of around 0.6. Using simple scalings,\nwe argue that the speed increase is not due to the local decrease of the flow\nviscosity around the helical filament but hypothesise instead that it\noriginates from confinement-like effect due to viscosity stratification around\nthe swimmer.\n", "  We elucidate the mechanism of enhancement of the $\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\to\n\\bar{\\nu}_{s}$ transitions at small mixing angles of Earth-core-crossing\nneutrinos, which is at the basis of the recent result of the IceCube experiment\non atmospheric muon anti-neutrino oscillations into sterile anti-neutrino.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on Bose-Einstein condensed atoms which rotate\nin annular/toroidal traps we study the effect of the finiteness of the atom\nnumber $N$ on the states of lowest energy for a fixed expectation value of the\nangular momentum, under periodic boundary conditions. To attack this problem,\nwe develop a general strategy, considering a linear superposition of the\neigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian, with amplitudes that we extract from\nthe mean field approximation. This many-body state breaks the symmetry of the\nHamiltonian, it has the same energy to leading order in $N$ as the mean-field\nstate and the corresponding eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, however it has a\nlower energy to subleading order in $N$ and thus it is energetically favorable.\n", "  Semi-annihilation is a generic feature of dark matter theories stabilised by\nsymmetries larger than a $Z_2$. It contributes to thermal freeze out, but is\nirrelevant for direct and collider searches. This allows semi-annihilating dark\nmatter to avoid those limits in a natural way. We use an effective operator\napproach to make the first model-independent study of the associated\nphenomenology. We enumerate all possible operators that contribute to $2\\to2$\nsemi-annihilation up to dimension 6, plus leading terms at dimension 7. We find\nthat when the only light states charged under the dark symmetry are dark\nmatter, the model space is highly constrained. Only fifteen operators exist,\nand just two for single-component dark sectors. If there can be additional\nlight, unstable \"dark partner\" states the possible phenomenology greatly\nincreases, at the cost of additional model dependence in the dark partner decay\nmodes. We also derive the irreducible constraints on models with\nsingle-component dark matter from cosmic ray searches and astrophysical\nobservations. We find that for semi-annihilation to electrons and light quarks,\nthe thermal relic cross sections can be excluded for dark matter masses up\n", "  The lensing signal around galaxy clusters can, in principle, be used to test\ndetailed predictions for their average mass profile from numerical simulations.\nHowever, the intrinsic shape of the profiles can be smeared out when a sample\nthat spans a wide range of cluster masses is averaged in physical length units.\nThis effect especially conceals rapid changes in gradient such as the steep\ndrop associated with the splashback radius, a sharp edge corresponding to the\noutermost caustic in accreting halos. We optimize the extraction of such local\nfeatures by scaling individual halo profiles to a number of spherical\noverdensity radii, and apply this method to 16 X-ray-selected high-mass\nclusters targeted in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble. By\nforward-modeling the weak- and strong-lensing data presented by Umetsu et al.,\nwe show that, regardless of the scaling overdensity, the projected ensemble\ndensity profile is remarkably well described by an NFW or Einasto profile out\nto $R \\sim 2.5h^{-1}$Mpc, beyond which the profiles flatten. We constrain the\nNFW concentration to $c_{200c} = 3.66 \\pm 0.11$ at $M_{200c} \\simeq 1.0 \\times\n10^{15}h^{-1}M_\\odot$, consistent with and improved from previous work that\nused conventionally stacked lensing profiles, and in excellent agreement with\ntheoretical expectations. Assuming the profile form of Diemer & Kravtsov and\ngeneric priors calibrated from numerical simulations, we place a lower limit on\nthe splashback radius of the cluster halos, if it exists, of $R_{sp}/r_{200m} >\n0.89$ ($R_{sp} > 1.83h^{-1}$Mpc) at 68% confidence. The corresponding density\nfeature is most pronounced when the cluster profiles are scaled by $r_{200m}$,\nand smeared out when scaled to higher overdensities.\n", "  Measurements of heavy flavor production in heavy-ion collisions have played\nan important role in understanding the properties of the quark-gluon plasma\ncreated in such collision. Due to their large masses, heavy flavor quarks\npresent unique sensitivity to the kinematics as well as the dynamics of the hot\nand dense medium. In this article, a selection of recent measurements on heavy\nflavor production in p+p, p+A and A+A collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies\nwill be presented. The measurements in p+p collisions serve as benchmarks to\nfundamental theories, and as references to similar studies in A+A collisions\nwhere the hot medium effects are present. On the other hand, the measurements\nin p+A collisions can help to quantify the cold nuclear matter effects which\nare also in effect in A+A collisions and thus need to be taken into account\nwhen interpreting the measurements in heavy-ion collisions. The experimental\nresults from A+A collisions are discussed and compared to theoretical\ncalculations, which can shed lights on the understanding of the quark-gluon\nplasma.\n", "  Gerry Brown initiated some early studies on the coexistence of different\nnuclear shapes. The subject has continued to be of interest and is crucial for\nunderstanding nuclear fission. We now have a very good picture of the potential\nenergy surface with respect to shape degrees of freedom in heavy nuclei, but\nthe dynamics remain problematic. In contrast, the early studies on light nuclei\nwere quite successful in describing the mixing between shapes. Perhaps a new\napproach in the spirit of the old calculations could better elucidate the\ncharacter of the fission dynamics and explain phenomena that current theory\ndoes not model well.\n", "  Here, we study the role of topological edge states of light in the transport\nof thermally generated radiation in a closed cavity at a thermodynamic\nequilibrium. It is shown that even in the zero temperature limit - when the\nfield fluctuations are purely quantum mechanical - there is a persistent flow\nof electromagnetic momentum in the cavity in closed orbits, deeply rooted in\nthe emergence of spatially separated unidirectional edge state channels. It is\nhighlighted the electromagnetic orbital angular momentum of the system is\nnontrivial, and that the energy circulation is towards the same direction as\nthat determined by incomplete cyclotron orbits near the cavity walls. Our\nfindings open new inroads in topological photonics and suggest that topological\nstates of light can determine novel paradigms in the context of radiative heat\ntransport.\n", "  We examine SL(2, Z) anomalies in ten and eight-dimensional supergravities,\nthe induced local counterterms and their realization in string theory.\nComposite connections play an important role in the cancellation mechanism. At\nthe same time their global properties lead to novel non-trivial consistency\nconstraints on compactifications.\n", "  We investigate multilepton signatures, arising from the decays of doubly\ncharged and singly charged Higgs bosons in the Type-II Seesaw model. Depending\non the vacuum expectation value of the triplet $v_{\\Delta}$, the doubly and\nsingly charged Higgs bosons can decay into a large variety of multi-lepton\nfinal states. We explore all possible decay modes corresponding to different\nregimes of $v_{\\Delta}$, that generate distinguishing four and five leptonic\nsignatures. We focus on the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and further\nextend the study to a very high energy proton-proton collider (VLHC) with a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 100 TeV. We find that a doubly charged Higgs boson of\nmasses around 375 GeV can be discovered at immediate LHC runs. A heavier mass\nof 630 GeV can instead be discovered at the high-luminosity run of the LHC or\nat the VLHC with 30 $\\rm{fb}^{-1}$.\n", "  The inclusive breakup of three-fragment projectiles is discussed within a\nfour-body spectator model. Both the elastic breakup and the non-elastic breakup\nare obtained in a unified framework. Originally developed in the 80's for\ntwo-fragment projectiles such as the deuteron, in this paper the theory is\nsuccessfully generalized to three-fragment projectiles. The expression obtained\nfor the inclusive cross section allows the extraction of the incomplete fusion\ncross section, and accordingly generalizes the surrogate method to cases such\nas (t,p) and (t,n) reactions. It is found that two-fragment correlations inside\nthe projectile affect in a conspicuous way the elastic breakup cross section.\nThe inclusive non-elastic breakup cross section is calculated and is found to\ncontain the contribution of a three-body absorption term that is also strongly\ninfluenced by the two-fragment correlations. This latter cross section contains\nthe so-called incomplete fusion where more than one compound nuclei are formed.\nOur theory describes both stable weakly bound three-fragment projectiles and\nunstable ones such as the Borromean nuclei.\n", "  Collider events with multi-stage cascade decays fill out the kinematically\nallowed region in phase space with a density that is enhanced at the boundary.\nThe boundary encodes all available information about the spectrum and is well\npopulated even with moderate signal statistics due to this enhancement. In\nprevious work, the improvement in the precision of mass measurements for\ncascade decays with three visible and one invisible particles was demonstrated\nwhen the full boundary information is used instead of endpoints of\none-dimensional projections. We extend these results to cascade decays with\nfour visible and one invisible particles. We also comment on how the topology\nof the cascade decay can be determined from the differential distribution of\nevents in these scenarios.\n", "  We put forward the Axionic String Ansatz (ASA), which provides a unified\ndescription for the worldsheet dynamics of confining strings in pure\nYang--Mills theory both in $D=3$ and $D=4$ space-time dimensions. The ASA is\nmotivated by the excitation spectrum of long confining strings, as measured on\na lattice, and by recently constructed integrable axionic non-critical string\nmodels. According to the ASA, pure gluodynamics in 3D is described by a\nnon-critical bosonic string theory without any extra local worldsheet degrees\nof freedom. We argue that this assumption fixes the set of quantum numbers\n(spins, $P$- and $C$-parities) of almost all glueball states. We confront the\nresulting predictions with the properties of approximately $1^2+2^2+3^2+5^2=39$\nlightest glueball states measured on a lattice and find a good agreement. On\nthe other hand, the spectrum of low lying glueballs in 4D gluodynamics suggests\nthe presence of a massive pseudoscalar mode on the string worldsheet, in\nagreement with the ASA and lattice data for long strings.\n", "  In the framework of spin-0 $s$-channel simplified models, we explore the\npossibility of assessing the structure of dark matter interactions through the\nassociate production of dark matter and $t\\bar{t}$ pairs. To this purpose,\nfinal states with two leptons are considered and the kinematic properties of\nthe dilepton system is studied. We develop a realistic analysis strategy and\nprovide a detailed evaluation of the achievable sensitivity for the dark matter\nsignal assuming integrated luminosities of $300 \\, {\\rm fb}^{-1}$ and $3 \\,\n{\\rm ab}^{-1}$ at the 14 TeV LHC. Furthermore, upper limits on the mediator\nmasses for which the two different CP hypotheses can be distinguished are\nderived. The obtained limits on the signal strengths are finally translated\ninto constraints on the parameter space of two spin-0 simplified models\nincluding a scenario with an extended Higgs sector.\n", "  In order to understand the observed physical and orbital diversity of\nextrasolar planetary systems, a full investigation of these objects and of\ntheir host stars is necessary. Within this field, one of the main purposes of\nthe GAPS observing project with HARPS-N@TNG is to provide a more detailed\ncharacterisation of already known systems. In this framework we monitored the\nstar, hosting two giant planets, HD108874, with HARPS-N for three years in\norder to refine the orbits, to improve the dynamical study and to search for\nadditional low-mass planets in close orbits. We subtracted the radial velocity\n(RV) signal due to the known outer planets, finding a clear modulation of 40.2\nd period. We analysed the correlation between RV residuals and the activity\nindicators and modelled the magnetic activity with a dedicated code. Our\nanalysis suggests that the 40.2 d periodicity is a signature of the rotation\nperiod of the star. A refined orbital solution is provided, revealing that the\nsystem is close to a mean motion resonance of about 9:2, in a stable\nconfiguration over 1 Gyr. Stable orbits for low-mass planets are limited to\nregions very close to the star or far from it. Our data exclude super-Earths\nwith Msin i \\gtrsim 5 M_Earth within 0.4 AU and objects with Msin i \\gtrsim 2\nM_Earth with orbital periods of a few days. Finally we put constraints on the\nhabitable zone of the system, assuming the presence of an exomoon orbiting the\ninner giant planet.\n", "  Antiferromagnets (AFMs) are presently considered as promising materials for\napplications in spintronics and random access memories due to the robustness of\ninformation stored in AFM state against perturbing magnetic fields (P. Wadley\net al., Science 351, 587 (2016)). In this respect, AFM multiferroics maybe\nattractive alternatives for conventional AFMs as the coupling of magnetism with\nferroelectricity (magnetoelectric effect) offers an elegant possibility of\nelectric field control and switching of AFM domains. Here we report the results\nof comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations of the quadratic\nmagnetoelectric (ME) effect in single crystals and high-resistive ceramics of\nPb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PFN) and (1- x)Pb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3xPbTiO3 (PFNxPT). We are\ninterested primarily in the temperature range of multiferroic phase, T < 150 K,\nwhere the ME coupling coefficient is extremely large (as compared to well-known\nmultiferroic BiFeO3) and shows sign reversal at\nparamagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic phase transition. Moreover, we observe strong\nME response nonlinearity in the AFM phase in the magnetic fields of only few\nkOe. To describe the temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the above\nunusual features of ME effect in PFN and PFN-xPT, we use simple\nphenomenological Landau approach which explains experimental data surprisingly\nwell. Our ME measurements demonstrate that the electric field of only 20-25\nkV/cm is able to switch the AFM domains and align them with ferroelectric ones\neven in PFN ceramic samples.\n", "  In this study we investigate the calibration of surface brightness--color\n(SBC) relations based solely on eclipsing binary stars. We selected a sample of\n35 detached eclipsing binaries with trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia DR1 or\nHipparcos, whose absolute dimensions are known with an accuracy better than 3%\nand that lie within 0.3 kpc from the Sun. For the purpose of this study, we\nused mostly homogeneous optical and near-infrared photometry based on the\nTycho-2 and 2MASS catalogs. We derived geometric angular diameters for all\nstars in our sample with a precision better than 10%, and for 11 of them with a\nprecision better than 2%. The precision of individual angular diameters of the\neclipsing binary components is currently limited by the precision of the\ngeometric distances ($\\sim$5% on average). However, by using a subsample of\nsystems with the best agreement between their geometric and photometric\ndistances, we derived the precise SBC relations based only on eclipsing binary\nstars. These relations have precisions that are comparable to the best\navailable SBC relations based on interferometric angular diameters, and they\nare fully consistent with them. With very precise Gaia parallaxes becoming\navailable in the near future, angular diameters with a precision better than 1%\nwill be abundant. At that point, the main uncertainty in the total error budget\nof the SBC relations will come from transformations between different\nphotometric systems, disentangling of component magnitudes, and for hot OB\nstars, the main uncertainty will come from the interstellar extinction\ndetermination. We argue that all these issues can be overcome with modern\nhigh-quality data and conclude that a precision better than 1% is entirely\nfeasible.\n", "  Context. Carbon, oxygen and nitrogen (CNO) are key elements in stellar\nformation and evolution, and their abundances should also have a significant\nimpact on planetary formation and evolution.\n  Aims. We present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of 1110 solar-type stars,\n143 of which are known to have planetary companions. We have determined the\ncarbon abundances of these stars and investigate a possible connection between\nC and the presence of planetary companions. Methods. We used the HARPS\nspectrograph to obtain high-resolution optical spectra of our targets. Spectral\nsynthesis of the CH band at 4300\\AA was performed with the spectral synthesis\ncodes MOOG and FITTING.\n  Results. We have studied carbon in several reliable spectral windows and have\nobtained abundances and distributions that show that planet host stars are\ncarbon rich when compared to single stars, a signature caused by the known\nmetal-rich nature of stars with planets. We find no different behaviour when\nseparating the stars by the mass of the planetary companion.\n  Conclusions. We conclude that reliable carbon abundances can be derived for\nsolar-type stars from the CH band at 4300\\AA. We confirm two different slope\ntrends for [C/Fe] with [Fe/H] because the behaviour is opposite for stars above\nand below solar values. We observe a flat distribution of the [C/Fe] ratio for\nall planetary masses, a finding that apparently excludes any clear connection\nbetween the [C/Fe] abundance ratio and planetary mass.\n", "  We discuss the light baryon spectrum obtained from a recent quark-diquark\ncalculation, implementing non-pointlike diquarks that are self-consistently\ncalculated from their Bethe-Salpeter equations. We examine the orbital angular\nmomentum content in the baryons' rest frame and highlight the fact that baryons\ncarry all possible values of L compatible with their spin, without the\nrestriction P=(-1)^L which is only valid nonrelativistically. We furthermore\ninvestigate the meaning of complex conjugate eigenvalues of Bethe-Salpeter\nequations, their possible connection with 'anomalous' states, and we propose a\nmethod to eliminate them from the spectrum.\n", "  It is well known that in some cases the spectral parameter has a group\ninterpretation. We discuss in detail the case of Gauss-Codazzi equations for\nisothermic surfaces immersed in $E^3$. The algebra of Lie point symmetries is\n4-dimensional and all these symmetries are also symmetries of the\nGaus-Weingarten equations (which can be considered as so(3)-valued\nnon-parametric linear problem). In order to obtain a non-removable spectral\nparameter one has to consider so(4,1)-valued linear problem which has a\n3-dimensional algebra of Lie point symmetries. The missing symmetry introduces\na non-removable parameter. In the second part of the paper we extend these\nresults on the case of isothermic immersions in arbitrary multidimensional\nEuclidean spaces. In order to simplify calculations the problem was formulated\nin terms of a Clifford algebra.\n", "  In the previous works (arXiv:1202.5375 and 1402.1346), the dynamical domain\nwall, where the four dimensional FRW universe is embedded in the five\nimensional space-time, has been realized by using two scalar fields. In this\npaper, we consider the localization of vector field in three formulations. The\nfirst formulation was investigated in the previous paper (arXiv:1510.01099) for\nthe $U(1)$ gauge field. In the second formulation, we investigate the\nDvali-Shifman mechanism (hep-th/9612128), where the non-abelian gauge field is\nconfined in the bulk but the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken on the\ndomain wall. In the third formulation, we investigate the Kaluza-Klein modes\ncoming from the five dimensional graviton. In the Randall-Sundrum model, the\ngraviton was localized on the brane. We show that the $(5,\\mu)$ components\n$\\left(\\mu=0,1,2,3\\right)$ of the graviton are also localized on the domain\nwall and can be regarded as the vector field on the domain wall. There are,\nhowever, some corrections coming from the bulk extra dimension if the domain\nwall universe is expanding.\n", "  Asymptotic spacetime symmetries have been conjectured to play an important\nrole in quantum gravity. In this paper we study the breaking of asymptotic\nsymmetries associated with a null horizon boundary. In two-dimensions, these\nsymmetries are reparametrizations of the time parameter on the horizon. We show\nhow this horizon reparametrization symmetry is explicitly and spontaneously\nbroken in dilaton gravity and construct an effective action for these\npseudo-Goldstone modes using the on-shell gravitational action for a null\nboundary. The variation of this action yields the horizon constraint equation.\nThis action is invariant under a 2 parameter subgroup of $SL(2)$\ntransformations, whose Noether charges we interpret via the membrane paradigm.\nWe place these results in the context of recent work on the near $AdS_2$/ near\n$CFT_1$ correspondence. In this setting the horizon action characterizes the\ninfrared regime near the horizon and has a hydrodynamical sigma model form. We\nalso discuss our construction in General Relativity. In the three-dimensional\ncase there is a natural generalization of our results. However, in higher\ndimensions, the variation of the effective action only yields the Raychaudhuri\nequation for small perturbations of the horizon.\n", "  ZZ Ceti stars are pulsating white dwarfs with a carbon-oxygen core build up\nduring the core helium burning and thermally pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch\nphases. Through the interpretation of their pulsation periods by means of\nasteroseismology, details about their origin and evolution can be inferred. The\nwhole pulsation spectrum exhibited by ZZ Ceti stars strongly depends on the\ninner chemical structure. At present, there are several processes affecting the\nchemical profiles that are still not accurately determined. We present a study\nof the impact of the current uncertainties of the white dwarf formation and\nevolution on the expected pulsation properties of ZZ Ceti stars. Our analysis\nis based on a set of carbon-oxygen core white dwarf models with masses $0.548$\nand $0.837 M_{\\sun}$ derived from full evolutionary computations from the ZAMS\nto the ZZ Ceti domain. We have considered models in which we varied the number\nof thermal pulses, the amount of overshooting, and the\n$^{12}$C$(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}$O reaction rate within their uncertainties. We\nexplore the impact of these major uncertainties in prior evolution on the\nchemical structure and the expected pulsation spectrum. We find that these\nuncertainties yield significant changes in the $g$-mode pulsation periods. We\nconclude that the uncertainties in the white dwarf progenitor evolution should\nbe be taken into account in detailed asterseismological analysis of these\npulsating stars.\n", "  We compute one-loop quantum corrections to gravitational couplings in the\neffective action of four-dimensional heterotic strings where supersymmetry is\nspontaneously broken by Scherk-Schwarz fluxes. We show that in both heterotic\nand type II theories of this class, no moduli dependent corrections to the\nPlanck mass are generated. We explicitly compute the one-loop corrections to\nthe $\\mathcal R^2$ coupling and find that, despite the absence of\nsupersymmetry, its contributions may still be organised into representations of\nsubgroups of the modular group, and admit a universal form, determined uniquely\nby the multiplicities of the ground states of the theory. Moreover, similarly\nto the case of gauge couplings, also the gravitational sector may become\nstrongly coupled in models which dynamically induce large volume for the extra\ndimensions.\n", "  We describe a new model of deformed relativistic kinematics based on the\ngroup manifold $U(1) \\times SU(2)$ as a four-momentum space. We discuss the\naction of the Lorentz group on such space and and illustrate the deformed\ncomposition law for the group-valued momenta. Due to the geometric structure of\nthe group, the deformed kinematics is governed by {\\it two} energy scales\n$\\lambda$ and $\\kappa$. A relevant feature of the model is that it exhibits a\nrunning spectral dimension $d_s$ with the characteristic short distance\nreduction to $d_s =2$ found in most quantum gravity scenarios.\n", "  A fieldable dual-comb spectrometer is described based on a \"bootstrapped\"\nfrequency referencing scheme in which short-term optical phase coherence\nbetween combs is attained by referencing each to a free-running diode laser,\nwhilst high frequency resolution and long-term accuracy is derived from a\nstable quartz oscillator. This fieldable dual-comb spectrometer was used to\nmeasure spectra with full comb-tooth resolution spanning from 140 THz (2.14 um,\n4670 cm^-1) to 184 THz (1.63 um, 6140 cm^-1) in the near infrared with a\nfrequency sampling of 200 MHz (0.0067 cm^-1), ~ 120 kHz frequency resolution,\nand ~ 1 MHz frequency accuracy. High resolution spectra of water and carbon\ndioxide transitions at 1.77 um, 1.96 um and 2.06 um show that the molecular\ntransmission acquired with this fieldable system did not deviate from those\nmeasured with a laboratory-based system (referenced to a maser and\ncavity-stabilized laser) to within 5.6x10^-4. Additionally, the fieldable\nsystem optimized for carbon dioxide quantification at 1.60 um, demonstrated a\nsensitivity of 2.8 ppm-km at 1 s integration time, improving to 0.10 ppm-km at\n13 minutes of integration time.\n", "  Many galaxy formation models predict alignments between galaxy spin and the\ncosmic web (i.e. the directions of filaments and sheets), leading to intrinsic\nalignment between galaxies that creates a systematic error in weak lensing\nmeasurements. These effects are often predicted to be stronger at\nhigh-redshifts ($z\\gtrsim1$) that are inaccessible to massive galaxy surveys on\nforeseeable instrumentation, but IGM tomography of the Ly$\\alpha$ forest from\nclosely-spaced quasars and galaxies is starting to measure the $z\\sim2-3$\ncosmic web with the requisite fidelity. Using mock surveys from hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we examine the utility of this technique, in conjunction with\ncoeval galaxy samples, to measure alignment between galaxies and the cosmic web\nat $z\\sim2.5$. We show that IGM tomography surveys with $\\lesssim5$ $h^{-1}$\nMpc sightline spacing can accurately recover the eigenvectors of the tidal\ntensor, which we use to define the directions of the cosmic web. For galaxy\nspins and shapes, we use a model parametrized by the alignment strength,\n$\\Delta\\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle$, with respect to the tidal tensor eigenvectors\nfrom the underlying density field, and also consider observational effects such\nas errors in the galaxy position angle, inclination, and redshift. Measurements\nusing the upcoming $\\sim1\\,\\mathrm{deg}^2$ CLAMATO tomographic survey and 600\ncoeval zCOSMOS-Deep galaxies should place $3\\sigma$ limits on extreme alignment\nmodels with $\\Delta\\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle\\sim0.1$, but much larger surveys\nencompassing $>10,000$ galaxies, such as Subaru PFS, will be required to\nconstrain models with $\\Delta\\langle\\cos\\theta\\rangle\\sim0.03$. These\nmeasurements will constrain models of galaxy-cosmic web alignment and test\ntidal torque theory at $z\\sim2$, improving our understanding of the redshift\ndependence of galaxy-cosmic web alignment and the physics of intrinsic\nalignments.\n", "  We have identified an unusually stable helical coil allotrope of phosphorus.\nOur ab initio Density Functional Theory calculations indicate that the\nuncoiled, isolated straight 1D chain is equally stable as a monolayer of black\nphosphorus dubbed phosphorene. The coiling tendency and the attraction between\nadjacent coil segments add an extra stabilization energy of about 12 meV/atom\nto the coil allotrope, similar in value to the approximately 16 meV/atom\ninter-layer attraction in bulk black phosphorus. Thus, the helical coil\nstructure is essentially as stable as black phosphorus, the most stable\nphosphorus allotrope known to date. With an optimum radius of 2.4 nm, the\nhelical coil of phosphorus may fit well and even form inside wide carbon\nnanotubes.\n", "  Geoneutrinos are electron antineutrinos ($\\bar\\nu_e$) generated by the\nbeta-decays of radionuclides naturally occurring inside the Earth, in\nparticular $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, and $^{40}$K. Measurement of these neutrinos\nprovides powerful constraints on the radiogenic heat of the Earth and tests on\nthe Earth models. Since the prediction of $\\bar\\nu_e$'s in geoneutrino flux is\nsubject to neutrino oscillation effects, we performed a calculation including\ndetailed oscillation analysis in the propagation of geoneutrinos and reactor\nneutrinos generated around the Earth. The expected geoneutrino signal, the\nreactor neutrino background rates and the systematic error budget are provided\nfor a proposed 3-kiloton neutrino detector at the Jinping underground lab in\nSichuan, China. In addition, we evaluated sensitivities for the geoneutrino\nflux, Th/U ratio and power of a possible fission reactor in the interior of\nEarth.\n", "  DIBs are ubiquitous in stellar spectra. Traditionally, they have been studied\nthrough their extraction from hot stars, because of their smooth continuum. In\nan era where there are several going-on or planned massive Galactic surveys\nusing multi-object spectrographs, cool stars constitute an appealing set of\ntargets. From the technical point of view, the extraction of DIBs in their\nspectra is more challenging due to the complexity of the continuum. In this\ncontribution we will provide the community with an improved set of stellar\nlines in the spectral regions associated to the strong DIBs at l6196, l6269,\nl6284, and l6379. These lines will allow for the creation of better stellar\nsynthetic spectra, reproducing the background emission and a more accurate\nextraction of the magnitudes associated with a given DIB. The Sun and Arcturus\nwere used as representative examples of dwarf and giant stars, respectively. A\nhigh quality spectrum for each of them was modeled using TURBOSPECTRUM and the\nVALD stellar line list. The oscillator strength log(gf) and/or wavelength of\nspecific lines were modified to create synthetic spectra where the residuals in\nboth the Sun and Arcturus were minimized. The synthetic spectra based on the\nimproved line lists reproduce the observed spectra for the Sun and Arcturus in\nthe mentioned spectral ranges with greater accuracy. Residuals between the\nsynthetic and observed spectra are always <10%, much better than with\npreviously existing options. The new line list has been tested with some\ncharacteristic spectra, from a variety of stars, including both giant and dwarf\nstars, and under different degrees of extinction. As it happened with the Sun\nand Arcturus residuals in the fits used to extract the DIB information are\nsmaller when using synthetic spectra made with the updated line lists. Tables\nwith the updated parameters are provided to the community.\n", "  This report will review the Higgs boson properties: the mass, the total width\nand the couplings to fermions and bosons. The measurements have been performed\nwith the data collected in 2011 and 2012 at the LHC accelerator at CERN by the\nATLAS and CMS experiments. Theoretical frameworks to search for new physics are\nalso introduced and discussed.\n", "  We present a generalized Richardson solution for fermions interacting with\nthe pairing interaction in both discrete and continuum parts of the single\nparticle (s.p.) spectrum. The pairing Hamiltonian is based on the rational\nGaudin (RG) model which is formulated in the Berggren ensemble. We show that\nsolutions of the generalized Richardson equations are exact in the two limiting\nsituations: (i) in the pole approximation and (ii) in the s.p. continuum. If\nthe s.p. spectrum contains both discrete and continuum parts, then the\ngeneralized Richardson equations provide accurate solutions for the Gamow Shell\nModel.\n", "  Some general remarks about integral transform approaches to response\nfunctions are made. Their advantage for calculating cross sections at energies\nin the continuum is stressed. In particular we discuss the class of kernels\nthat allow calculations of the transform by matrix diagonalization. A\nparticular set of such kernels, namely the wavelets, is tested in a model\nstudy.\n", "  The $ND$ and $NB$ systems with $I=0$ and $1$, $J^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}^{\\pm}$,\n$\\frac{3}{2}^{\\pm}$, and $\\frac{5}{2}^{\\pm}$ are investigated within the\nframework of quark delocalization color screening model. The results show that\nall the positive parity states are unbound. By coupling to the $ND^{*}$\nchannel, the state $ND$ with $I=0,~J^{P}=\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ can form a bound\nstate, which can be invoked to explain the observed $\\Sigma(2800)$ state. The\nmass of the $ND^{*}$ with $I=0,~J^{P}=\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ is close to that of the\nreported $\\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$, which indicates that $\\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$\ncan be explained as a $ND^{*}$ molecular state in QDCSM. Besides, the $\\Delta\nD^{*}$ with $I=1,~J^{P}=\\frac{5}{2}^{-}$ is also a possible resonance state.\nThe results of the bottom case of $NB$ system are similar to those of the $ND$\nsystem. Searching for these states will be a challenging subject of\nexperiments.\n", "  Lovelock theory of gravity provides a tractable model to investigate the\neffects of higher-curvature terms in the context of AdS/CFT. Yielding second\norder, ghost-free field equations, this theory represents a minimal setup in\nwhich higher-order gravitational couplings in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) spaces, including black holes, can be solved analytically. This however\nhas an obvious limitation as in dimensions lower than seven, the contribution\nfrom cubic or higher curvature terms is merely topological. Therefore, in order\nto go beyond quadratic order and study higher terms in AdS_5 analytically, one\nis compelled to look for other toy models. One such model is the so-called\nquasi-topological gravity, which, despite being a higher-derivative theory,\nprovides a tractable setup with R^3 and R^4 terms. In this paper, we\ninvestigate AdS_5 black holes in quasi-topological gravity. We consider the\ntheory conformally coupled to matter and in presence of Abelian gauge fields.\nWe show that charged black holes in AdS_5 which, in addition, exhibit a\nbackreaction of the matter fields on the geometry can be found explicitly in\nthis theory. These solutions generalize the black hole solution of\nquasi-topological gravity and exist in a region of the parameter spaces\nconsistent with the constraints coming from causality and other consistency\nconditions. They have finite conserved charges and exhibit non-trivial\nthermodynamical properties.\n", "  We assess the performance of nonempirical, truly nonlocal and semi-local\nfunctionals with regard to structural and thermal properties of $3d$, $4d$, and\n$5d$ non-magnetic transition metals. We focus on constraint-based functionals\nand consider the new consistent-exchange van der Waals density functional\nversion vdW-DF-cx [Phys. Rev. B 89, 035412 (2014)], the semi-local PBE [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)] and PBEsol functionals [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100,\n136406 (2008)] as well as the AM05 meta-functional [Phys. Rev. B 72, 085108\n(2005)]. Using the quasi-harmonic approximation structural parameters, elastic\nresponse, and thermal expansion at finite temperatures are computed and\ncompared to experimental data. We also compute cohesive energies explicitly\nincluding zero-point vibrations. It is shown that overall vdW-DF-cx provides an\naccurate description of thermal properties and retains a level of\ntransferability and accuracy that is comparable to or better than some of the\nbest constraint-based semi-local functionals. Especially, with regard to the\ncohesive energies the consistent inclusion of spin polarization effects in the\natoms turns out to be crucial and it is important to use the rigorous\nspin-vdW-DF-cx formulation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 136402 (2015)]. This\ndemonstrates that vdW-DF-cx has general-purpose character and can be used to\nstudy systems that have both sparse and dense electron distributions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of gravitational lumps. By a lump, we mean a metric\nconfiguration that asymptotes to a flat space-time. Such lumps emerge in string\ntheory as strong coupling descriptions of D-branes. We provide a physical\nargument that the broken global symmetries of such a background, generated by\ncertain large diffeomorphisms, constrain the dynamics of localized modes. These\nmodes include the translation zero modes and any localized tensor modes. The\nconstraints we find are gravitational analogues of those found in brane\nphysics. For the example of a Taub-NUT metric in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity, we argue that a critical value for the electric field arises from\nstandard gravity without higher derivative interactions.\n", "  Published X-ray emission properties for a sample of 50 supernova remnants\n(SNRs) in the LMC are used as input for SNR evolution modelling calculations.\nThe forward shock emission is modelled to obtain the initial explosion energy,\nage, and circumstellar medium density for each SNR in the sample. The resulting\nage distribution yields a SNR birthrate of 1/(500 yr) for the LMC. The\nexplosion energy distribution is well fit by a log-normal distribution, with\nmost-probable explosion energy of $0.5\\times10^{51}$erg, with a 1-$\\sigma$\ndispersion by factor 3 in energy. The circumstellar medium density distribution\nis broader than the explosion energy distribution, with most-probable density\nof $\\sim$0.1 cm$^{-3}$. The shape of the density distribution can be fit with a\nlog-normal distribution, with incompleteness at high density caused by shorter\nevolution times of SNRs.\n", "  We compute the one-loop contributions from a color octet scalar to the tensor\nanomalous couplings of top and bottom quarks to gluons, photons and W bosons.\nWe use known constraints on the parameters of the model to compare the\npredicted size of these couplings with existing phenomenological constraints.\n", "  Consider local dephasing processes of a qubit that interacts with a\nstructured reservoir of frequency modes or a thermal bath, with Ohmic-like\nspectral density (SD). It is known that non-Markovian evolution appears\nuniquely above a temperature-dependent critical value of the Ohmicity\nparameter, and non-Markovianity can be induced by properly engineering the\nexternal environment. In the same scenario, we find that the flow of quantum\ninformation shows regular patterns: alternate directions appear in\ncorrespondence of periodical intervals of the Ohmicity parameter $\\alpha_0$.\nThe information flows back into the system over long times for\n$2+4n<\\alpha_0<4+4n$, at zero temperature, and for $3+4n<\\alpha_0<5+4n$, at\nnon-vanishing temperatures, where $n=0,1,2,\\ldots$. Otherwise, the long time\ninformation flows into the environment. In the transition from vanishing to\narbitrary non-vanishing temperature, the long time back-flow of information is\nstable for $3+4n<\\alpha_0<4+4n$, while it is reverted for $2+4n<\\alpha_0<3+4n$\nand $4+4n<\\alpha_0<5+4n$. The patterns of the information flow are not altered\nif the low frequency Ohmic-like profiles of the SDs are perturbed with\nadditional factors that consist in arbitrary powers of logarithmic forms.\nConsequently, the flow of information can be controlled, directed and reverted\nover long times by engineering a wide variety of reservoirs that includes and\ncontinuously departs from the Ohmic-like structure at low frequencies.\nNon-Markovianity and recoherence appear according to the same rules along with\nthe back-flow of information.\n", "  The young and nearby star \\beta\\ Pictoris (\\beta\\ Pic) is surrounded by a\ndebris disk composed of dust and gas known to host a myriad evaporating\nexocomets, planetesimals and at least one planet. At an edge-on inclination, as\nseen from Earth, this system is ideal for debris disk studies providing an\nexcellent opportunity to use absorption spectroscopy to study the planet\nforming environment. Using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) instrument on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (HST) we observe the most abundant element in the\ndisk, hydrogen, through the HI Lyman \\alpha\\ (Ly-\\alpha\\) line. We present a\nnew technique to decrease the contamination of the Ly-\\alpha\\ line by\ngeocoronal airglow in COS spectra. This Airglow Virtual Motion (AVM) technique\nallows us to shift the Ly-\\alpha\\ line of the astrophysical target away from\nthe contaminating airglow emission revealing more of the astrophysical line\nprofile. The column density of hydrogen in the \\beta\\ Pic stable gas disk at\nthe stellar radial velocity is measured to be $\\log(N_{\\mathrm{H}}/1\n\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\ll 18.5$. The Ly-\\alpha\\ emission line profile is found to be\nasymmetric and we propose that this is caused by HI falling in towards the star\nwith a bulk radial velocity of $41\\pm6$ km/s relative to \\beta\\ Pic and a\ncolumn density of $\\log(N_{\\mathrm{H}}/1 \\mathrm{cm}^2) = 18.6\\pm0.1$. The high\ncolumn density of hydrogen relative to the hydrogen content of CI chondrite\nmeteorites indicates that the bulk of the hydrogen gas does not come from the\ndust in the disk. This column density reveals a hydrogen abundance much lower\nthan solar, which excludes the possibility that the detected hydrogen could be\na remnant of the protoplanetary disk or gas expelled by the star. We\nhypothesise that the hydrogen gas observed falling towards the star arises from\nthe dissociation of water originating from evaporating exocomets.\n", "  The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA) Band 1 receiver covers\nthe 35-50 GHz frequency band. Development of prototype receivers, including the\nkey components and subsystems has been completed and two sets of prototype\nreceivers were fully tested. We will provide an overview of the ALMA Band 1\nscience goals, and its requirements and design for use on the ALMA. The\nreceiver development status will also be discussed and the infrastructure,\nintegration, evaluation of fully-assembled band 1 receiver system will be\ncovered. Finally, a discussion of the technical and management challenges\nencountered will be presented.\n", "  We review construction of the improved holographic models for QCD-like\nconfining gauge theories and their applications to the physics of the\nQuark-gluon plasma. We also review recent progress in this area of research.\nThe lecture notes start from the vacuum structure of these theories, then\ndevelop thermodynamic and hydrodynamic observables and end with more advanced\ntopics such as the holographic QCD in the presence of external magnetic fields.\nThis is a summary of the lectures presented at the 56th Cracow School of\nTheoretical Physics in Spring 2016 at Zakopane, Poland.\n", "  Femtosecond, 8.04 KeV x-ray pulses are used to probe the lattice dynamics of\n150 nm Cu (111) single crystal on mica substrate irradiated with 400 nm, 100 fs\nlaser pulses. For pump fluencies below the damage and melting threshold, we\nobserved lattice contraction due to the formation of a blast force, and\ncoherent acoustic phonons with a period of ~69 ps. At larger pump fluence,\nsolid to liquid phase transition, annealing, and recrystallization were\nmeasured in real time by monitoring the intensity evolution of the probing fs\nx-ray rocking curves and agreed with theoretical simulation results. The\nexperimental data suggest the melting process is a purely thermal phase\ntransition. This study provides, in real time, an ultrafast time-resolved\ndetailed description of the significant processes that occurs as a result of a\nfemtosecond light-pulse interacts with the Cu (111) crystal surface.\n", "  Heavy flavour production like $J/\\psi$ and $D$- meson production in\nscattering of electrons/unpolarized protons off polarized proton target offer\npromising probes to investigate gluon Sivers function. In this talk, I will\nsummarize our recent work on trasverse single spin asymmetry in $J/\\psi $\n-production and $D$ - meson production in $p p^\\uparrow$ scattering using a\ngeneralized parton model approach. We compare predictions obtained using\ndifferent models of gluon Sivers function within this approach and then, taking\ninto account the transverse momentum dependent evolution of the unpolarized\nparton distribution functions and gluon Sivers function, we study the effect of\nevolution on asymmetry.\n", "  This paper describes the several phases which led, from the conceptual\ndesign, prototyping, construction and tests with beam, to the installation and\noperation of the BRAN (Beam RAte of Neutrals) relative luminosity monitors for\nthe LHC. The detectors have been operating since 2009 to contribute, optimize\nand maintain the accelerator performance in the two high luminosity interaction\nregions (IR), the IR1 (ATLAS) and the IR5 (CMS). The devices are gas ionization\nchambers installed inside a neutral particle absorber 140 m away from the\nInteraction Points in IR1 and IR5 and monitor the energy deposited by\nelectromagnetic showers produced by high-energy neutral particles from the\ncollisions. The detectors have the capability to resolve the bunch-by-bunch\nluminosity at the 40 MHz bunch rate, as well as to survive the extreme level of\nradiation during the nominal LHC operation. The devices have operated since the\nearly commissioning phase of the accelerator over a broad range of luminosities\nreaching 1.4*10^34 cm-2 s-1 with a peak pileup of 45 events per bunch crossing.\nEven though the nominal design luminosity of the LHC has been exceeded, the\nBRAN is operating well. After describing the multiple applications that the\nBRAN can be used to monitor the luminosity of the accelerator, we discuss the\ntechnical choices that led to its construction and the different tests\nperformed prior to the installation in two IRs of the LHC. Performance\nsimulations are presented together with operational results obtained during p-p\noperations, including runs at 40 MHz bunch rate, Pb-Pb operations and p-Pb\noperations.\n", "  We consider the cosmology derived from $f(T,B)$ gravity where $T$ is the\ntorsion scalar and $B=\\frac{2}{e}\\partial_{\\mu}(e T^{\\mu})$ a boundary term. In\nparticular we discuss how it is possible to recover, under the same standard,\nthe teleparallel $f(T)$ gravity, the curvature $f(R)$ gravity and the\nteleparallel-curvature $f(R,T)$ gravity, which are particular cases of\n$f(T,B)$. We adopt the Noether Symmetry Approach to study the related dynamical\nsystems and to find out cosmological solutions.\n", "  We present a review of the current understanding of the heavy quark\ndistributions in the nucleon and their impact on collider physics. The origin\nof strange, charm and bottom quark pairs at high light-front (LF) momentum\nfractions in hadron wave functions---the \"intrinsic\" quarks, is reviewed. The\ndetermination of heavy-quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) is\nparticularly significant for the analysis of hard processes at LHC energies. We\nshow that a careful study of the inclusive production of open charm and the\nproduction of $\\gamma$/$Z$/$W$ particles, accompanied by the heavy jets at\nlarge transverse momenta can give essential information on the intrinsic heavy\nquark (IQ) distributions. We also focus on the theoretical predictions\nconcerning other observables which are very sensitive to the intrinsic charm\ncontribution to PDFs including Higgs production at high xf and novel fixed\ntarget measurements which can be tested at the LHC.\n", "  We report on the design and implementation of a Field Programmable Josephson\nAmplifier (FPJA) - a compact and lossless superconducting circuit that can be\nprogrammed \\textit{in situ} by a set of microwave drives to perform reciprocal\nand nonreciprocal frequency conversion and amplification. In this work we\ndemonstrate four modes of operation: frequency conversion ($-0.5~\\mathrm{dB}$\ntransmission, $-30~\\mathrm{dB}$ reflection), circulation ($-0.5~\\mathrm{dB}$\ntransmission, $-30~\\mathrm{dB}$ reflection, $30~\\mathrm{dB}$ isolation),\nphase-preserving amplification (gain $>20~\\mathrm{dB}$, $1~\\mathrm{photon}$ of\nadded noise) and directional phase-preserving amplification ($-10~\\mathrm{dB}$\nreflection, $18~\\mathrm{dB}$ forward gain, $8~\\mathrm{dB}$ reverse isolation,\n$1~\\mathrm{photon}$ of added noise). The system exhibits quantitative agreement\nwith theoretical prediction. Based on a gradiometric Superconducting Quantum\nInterference Device (SQUID) with Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb Josephson junctions, the FPJA\nis first-order insensitive to flux noise and can be operated without magnetic\nshielding at low temperature. Due to its flexible design and compatibility with\nexisting superconducting fabrication techniques, the FPJA offers a\nstraightforward route toward on-chip integration with superconducting quantum\ncircuits such as qubits or microwave optomechanical systems.\n", "  We review data analysis techniques that can be used to study temporal\ncorrelations among conductance traces in break junction measurements. We show\nthat temporal histograms are a simple but efficient tool to check the temporal\nhomogeneity of the conductance traces, or to follow spontaneous or triggered\ntemporal variations, like structural modifications in trained contacts, or the\nemergence of single-molecule signatures after molecule dosing. To statistically\nanalyze the presence and the decay time of temporal correlations, we introduce\nshifted correlation plots. Finally, we demonstrate that correlations between\nopening and subsequent closing traces may indicate structural memory effects in\natomic-sized metallic and molecular junctions. Applying these methods on\nmeasured and simulated gold metallic contacts as a test system, we show that\nthe surface diffusion induced flattening of the broken junctions helps to\nproduce statistically independent conductance traces at room temperature,\nwhereas at low temperature repeating tendencies are observed as long as the\ncontacts are not closed to sufficiently high conductance setpoints. Applying\nopening-closing correlation analysis on Pt-CO-Pt single-molecule junctions, we\ndemonstrate pronounced contact memory effects and recovery of the molecule for\njunctions breaking before atomic chains are formed. However, if chains are\npulled the random relaxation of the chain and molecule after rupture prevents\nopening-closing correlations.\n", "  Using the Bogoliubov de-Gennes formalism, we investigate the charge and\nspin-dependent thermoelectric effects in superconductor graphene junctions.\nResults demonstrate that despite normal-superconductor junctions, there is a\ntemperature-dependent spin thermopower both in the graphene-based\nferromagnetic-superconductor (F-S) and ferromagnetic-Rashba spin-orbit\nregion-superconductor (F-RSO-S) junctions. It is also shown that in the\npresence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction, the charge and spin-dependent\nSeebeck coefficients can reach to their maximum up to 3.5$k_B/e$ and\n2.5$k_B/e$, respectively. Remarkably, these coefficients have a zero-point\ncritical value with respect to magnetic exchange field and chemical potential.\nThis effect disappears when the Rashba coupling is absent. These results\nsuggest that graphene-based superconductors can be used in spin-caloritronics\ndevices.\n", "  An era has started in which gas and dust can be observed independently in\nprotoplanetary disks, thanks to the recent surveys with ALMA. The first\nnear-complete high-resolution disk survey in both dust and gas in a single\nstar-forming region has been carried out in Lupus, finding surprisingly low\ngas/dust ratios. The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues\nobservations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in\norder to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed\nphysical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations\nof Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out. Employing\nalso the ALMA 13CO-only detections, disk gas masses have been calculated for a\ntotal of 34 sources, expanding the sample of 10 disks studied by Ansdell et al.\n(2016), where also C18O was detected. We confirm that overall gas-masses are\nvery low, often smaller than 1 $M_{\\rm J}$, if volatile carbon is not depleted.\nAccordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low\nCO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or\nalternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to\nmore complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA\nobservations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated\nboth scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of\nthe two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous\nprocesses over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current\nmass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a\nconstant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed $M_{\\rm\ndisk}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ ratio. This in turn points to a scenario in which\ncarbon depletion is responsible for the low CO isotopologue line luminosities.\n", "  This is an overview of the main theoretical developments presented at SQM2016\nheld in Berkeley, California (USA) in June 2015.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that some SGRs/AXPs could be canonical\nrotation-powered pulsars using realistic NS structure parameters instead of\nfiducial values. We show that realistic NS parameters lowers the estimated\nvalue of the magnetic field and radiation efficiency, $L_X/\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}$,\nwith respect to estimates based on fiducial NS parameters. We show that nine\nSGRs/AXPs can be described as canonical pulsars driven by the NS rotational\nenergy, for $L_X$ computed in the soft (2--10~keV) X-ray band. We compute the\nrange of NS masses for which $L_X/\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}<1$. We discuss the observed\nhard X-ray emission in three sources of the group of nine potentially\nrotation-powered NSs. This additional hard X-ray component dominates over the\nsoft one leading to $L_X/\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}>1$ in two of them. We show that 9\nSGRs/AXPs can be rotation-powered NSs if we analyze their X-ray luminosity in\nthe soft 2--10~keV band. Interestingly, four of them show radio emission and\nsix have been associated with supernova remnants (including Swift J1834.9-0846\nthe first SGR observed with a surrounding wind nebula). These observations give\nadditional support to our results of a natural explanation of these sources in\nterms of ordinary pulsars. Including the hard X-ray emission observed in three\nsources of the group of potential rotation-powered NSs, this number of sources\nwith $L_X/\\dot{E}_{\\rm rot}<1$ becomes seven. It remains open to verification\n1) the accuracy of the estimated distances and 2) the possible contribution of\nthe associated supernova remnants to the hard X-ray emission.\n", "  The correlation between emission-line luminosity (L) and profile width\n(sigma) for HII Galaxies provides a powerful method to measure the distances to\ngalaxies over a wide range of redshifts. In this paper we use SDSS\nspectrophotometry to explore the systematics of the correlation using the\n[OIII]5007 lines instead of Halpha or Hbeta to measure luminosities and line\nwidths. We also examine possible systematic effects involved in measuring the\nprofile-widths and the luminosities through different apertures. We find that\nthe green L-sigma relation defined using [OIII]5007 luminosities is\nsignificantly more sensitive than Hbeta to the effects of age and the physical\nconditions of the nebulae, which more than offsets the advantage of the higher\nstrength of the [OIII]5007 lines. We then explore the possibility of mixing\n[OIII]5007 profile-widths with SDSS Hbeta luminosities using the Hubble\nconstant H0 to quantify the possible systematic effects. We find the mixed\nL(Hbeta) sigma[OIII] relation to be at least as powerful as the canonical\nL-sigma relation as a distance estimator, and we show that the evolutionary\ncorrections do not change the slope and the scatter of the correlation, and\ntherefore, do not bias the L-sigma distance indicator at high redshifts.\nLocally, however, the luminosities of the Giant HII Regions that provide the\nzero-point calibrators are sensitive to evolutionary corrections and may bias\nthe Hubble constant if their mean ages, as measured by the equivalent widths of\nHbeta, are significantly different from the mean age of the HII Galaxies. Using\na small sample of 16 ad-hoc zero point calibrators we obtain a value of H0 =\n66.4\\pm4.5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for the Hubble constant, which is fully consistent\nwith the best modern determinations, and that is not biased by evolutionary\ncorrections.\n", "  We calculate Boltzmann neutrino energy transport with self-consistently\ncoupled nuclear reactions through the weak-decoupling-nucleosynthesis epoch in\nan early universe with significant lepton numbers. We find that the presence of\nlepton asymmetry enhances processes which give rise to nonthermal neutrino\nspectral distortions. Our results reveal how asymmetries in energy and entropy\ndensity uniquely evolve for different transport processes and neutrino flavors.\nThe enhanced distortions in the neutrino spectra alter the expected big bang\nnucleosynthesis light element abundance yields relative to those in the\nstandard Fermi-Dirac neutrino distribution cases. These yields, sensitive to\nthe shapes of the neutrino energy spectra, are also sensitive to the phasing of\nthe growth of distortions and entropy flow with time/scale factor. We analyze\nthese issues and speculate on new sensitivity limits of deuterium and helium to\nlepton number.\n", "  We analyze synthetic neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption and emission spectral\nlines from a high- resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation to\nquantify how well observational methods recover the physical properties of\ninterstellar gas. We present a new method for uniformly decomposing HI spectral\nlines and estimating the properties of associated gas using the Autonomous\nGaussian Decomposition (AGD) algorithm. We find that Hi spectral lines recover\nphysical structures in the simulation with excellent completeness at high\nGalactic latitude, and this completeness declines with decreasing latitude due\nto strong velocity-blending of spectral lines. The temperature and column\ndensity inferred from our decomposition and radiative transfer method agree\nwith the simulated values within a factor of < 2 for the majority of gas\nstructures. We next compare synthetic spectra with observations from the\n21-SPONGE survey at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array using AGD. We find more\ncomponents per line of sight in 21-SPONGE than in synthetic spectra, which\nreflects insufficient simulated gas scale heights and the limitations of local\nbox simulations. In addition, we find a significant population of low-optical\ndepth, broad absorption components in the synthetic data which are not seen in\n21-SPONGE. This population is not obvious in integrated or per-channel\ndiagnostics, and reflects the benefit of studying velocity-resolved components.\nThe discrepant components correspond to the highest spin temperatures (1000 <\nTs < 4000 K), which are not seen in 21-SPONGE despite sufficient observational\nsensitivity. We demonstrate that our analysis method is a powerful tool for\ndiagnosing neutral ISM conditions, and future work is needed to improve\nobservational statistics and implementation of simulated physics.\n", "  The gravity gradient is one of the most serious systematic effects in atomic\ntests of the equivalence principle (EP). While differential acceleration\nmeasurements performed with different atomic species under free fall test the\nvalidity of EP, minute displacements between the test masses in a gravity\ngradient produces a false EP-violating signal that limits the precision of the\ntest. We show that gravity inversion and modulation using a gimbal mount can\nsuppress the systematics due to gravity gradients caused by both moving and\nstationary parts of the instrument as well as the environment, strongly\nreducing the need to overlap two species.\n", "  Context: Transit or eclipse timing variations have proven to be a valuable\ntool in exoplanet research. However, no simple way to estimate the potential\nprecision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines\navailable regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.\n  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires\nonly basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's\nvalidity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal\nsampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in\ntiming-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that\ntransits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that\nexceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition. Prompt follow-up\nobservations will be needed to avoid a `loosing' of their ephemeris.\n", "  Galah is an ongoing high-resolution spectroscopic survey with the goal of\ndisentangling the formation history of the Milky Way, using the fossil remnants\nof disrupted star formation sites which are now dispersed around the Galaxy. It\nis targeting a randomly selected, magnitude limited ($V \\leq 14$) sample of\nstars, with the goal of observing one million objects. To date, 300,000 spectra\nhave been obtained. Not all of them are correctly processed by parameter\nestimation pipelines and we need to know about them. We present a\nsemi-automated classification scheme which identifies different types of\npeculiar spectral morphologies, in an effort to discover and flag potentially\nproblematic spectra and thus help to preserve the integrity of the survey's\nresults. To this end we employ a recently developed dimensionality reduction\ntechnique t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding), which enables\nus to represent the complex spectral morphology in a two-dimensional projection\nmap while still preserving the properties of the local neighbourhoods of\nspectra. We find that the majority (178,483) of the 209,533 Galah spectra\nconsidered in this study represents normal single stars, whereas 31,050\npeculiar and problematic spectra with very diverse spectral features pertaining\nto 28,579 stars are distributed into 10 classification categories: Hot stars,\nCool metal-poor giants, Molecular absorption bands, Binary stars,\nH$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ emission, H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ emission superimposed on\nabsorption, H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ P-Cygni, H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ inverted P-Cygni,\nLithium absorption, and Problematic. Classified spectra with supplementary\ninformation are presented in the catalogue, indicating candidates for follow-up\nobservations and population studies of the short-lived phases of stellar\nevolution.\n", "  Peak statistics in weak lensing maps access the non-Gaussian information\ncontained in the large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe. They are\ntherefore a promising complement to two-point and higher-order statistics to\nconstrain our cosmological models. To prepare for the high-precision data of\nnext-generation surveys, we assess the constraining power of peak counts in a\nsimulated Euclid-like survey on the cosmological parameters\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_8$, and $w_0^\\mathrm{de}$. In particular, we study\nhow the Camelus model--a fast stochastic algorithm for predicting peaks--can be\napplied to such large surveys. We measure the peak count abundance in a mock\nshear catalogue of ~5,000 sq. deg. using a multiscale mass map filtering\ntechnique. We then constrain the parameters of the mock survey using Camelus\ncombined with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). We find that peak\nstatistics yield a tight but significantly biased constraint in the\n$\\sigma_8$-$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ plane, indicating the need to better understand\nand control the model's systematics. We calibrate the model to remove the bias\nand compare results to those from the two-point correlation functions (2PCF)\nmeasured on the same field. In this case, we find the derived parameter\n$\\Sigma_8=\\sigma_8(\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}/0.27)^\\alpha=0.76_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$ with\n$\\alpha=0.65$ for peaks, while for 2PCF the value is\n$\\Sigma_8=0.76_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ with $\\alpha=0.70$. We therefore see comparable\nconstraining power between the two probes, and the offset of their\n$\\sigma_8$-$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ degeneracy directions suggests that a combined\nanalysis would yield tighter constraints than either measure alone. As\nexpected, $w_0^\\mathrm{de}$ cannot be well constrained without a tomographic\nanalysis, but its degeneracy directions with the other two varied parameters\nare still clear for both peaks and 2PCF. (abridged)\n", "  Using the present upper bound on the neutron electric dipole moment, we give\nan estimate for the upper limit of the CP-violating couplings of the eta(eta')\nto the nucleon. Using this result, we then derive constraints on the\nCP-violating eta(eta')-pi-pi couplings, which define the two-pion CP-violating\ndecays of the eta and eta' mesons. Our results are relevant for the running and\nplanned measurements of rare decays of the eta and eta' mesons by the GlueX\nCollaboration at JLab and the LHCb Collaboration at CERN.\n", "  We introduce a lattice fermion model in one spatial dimension with\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) but without particle number conservation. The Hamiltonian\nis defined as the anticommutator of two nilpotent supercharges $Q$ and\n$Q^\\dagger$. Each supercharge is built solely from spinless fermion operators\nand depends on a parameter $g$. The system is strongly interacting for small\n$g$, and in the extreme limit $g=0$, the number of zero-energy ground states\ngrows exponentially with the system size. By contrast, in the large-$g$ limit,\nthe system is non-interacting and SUSY is broken spontaneously. We study the\nmodel for modest values of $g$ and show that under certain conditions\nspontaneous SUSY breaking occurs in both finite and infinite chains. We analyze\nthe low-energy excitations both analytically and numerically. Our analysis\nsuggests that the Nambu-Goldstone fermions accompanying the spontaneous SUSY\nbreaking have cubic dispersion at low energies.\n", "  We characterize the influence that external noise, with both spatial and\ntemporal correlations, has on the scale dependence of the reaction parameters\nof a cubic autocatalytic reaction diffusion (CARD) system. Interpreting the\nCARD model as a primitive reaction scheme for a living system, the results\nindicate that power-law correlations in environmental fluctuations can either\ndecrease or increase the rates of nutrient decay and the rate of autocatalysis\n(replication) on small spatial and temporal scales.\n", "  The solar galactic neighbourhood contains a number of young co-moving\nassociations of stars (so-called `young moving groups') with ages of ~10--150\nMyr, which are prime targets for a range of scientific studies, including\ndirect imaging planet searches. The late-type stellar population of such groups\nstill remain in their pre-main sequence phase, and are thus well suited for\npurposes such as isochronal dating. Close binaries are particularly useful in\nthis regard, since they allow for a model-independent dynamical mass\ndetermination. Here we present a dedicated effort to identify new close\nbinaries in nearby young moving groups, through high-resolution imaging with\nthe AstraLux Sur Lucky Imaging camera. We surveyed 181 targets, resulting in\nthe detection of 61 companions or candidates, of which 38 are new discoveries.\nAn interesting example of such a case is 2MASS J00302572-6236015 AB, which is a\nhigh-probability member of the Tucana-Horologium moving group, and has an\nestimated orbital period of less than 10 years. Among the previously known\nobjects is a serendipitous detection of the deuterium burning boundary\ncircumbinary companion 2MASS J01033563-5515561 (AB)b in the z'-band, thereby\nextending the spectral coverage for this object down to near-visible\nwavelengths.\n", "  We study the impact of effective interactions onto relationally evolving GFT\ncondensates based on real-valued fields. In a first step we show that a free\ncondensate configuration in an isotropic restriction settles dynamically into a\nlow-spin configuration of the quantum geometry. This goes hand in hand with the\naccelerated and exponential expansion of its volume, as well as the vanishing\nof its relative uncertainty which suggests the classicalization of the quantum\ngeometry. The dynamics of the emergent space can then be given in terms of the\nclassical Friedmann equations. In contrast to models based on complex-valued\nfields, solutions avoiding the singularity problem can only be found if the\ninitial conditions are appropriately chosen. We then turn to the analysis of\nthe influence of effective interactions on the dynamics by studying in\nparticular the Thomas-Fermi regime. In this context, at the cost of\nfine-tuning, an epoch of inflationary expansion of quantum geometric origin can\nbe implemented. Finally, and for the first time, we study anisotropic GFT\ncondensate configurations and show that such systems tend to isotropize quickly\nas the value of the relational clock grows. This paves the way to a more\nsystematic investigation of anisotropies in the context of GFT condensate\ncosmology.\n", "  The Affleck-Dine leptogenesis scenario along the LHu flat direction is\nreconsidered. It is known that successful Affleck-Dine leptogenesis requires\nthat the lightest neutrino mass is extremely small. This situation can be\nsignificantly relaxed if the neutrino mass in the early universe is different\nfrom the present one. We consider a supersymmetric\nDine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) type model, which provides a solution\nto the strong CP problem and generates a SUSY mu-term and right-handed neutrino\nmasses. If the PQ scale during lepton number generation is much larger than the\npresent value, leptogenesis is very efficient so that enough baryon number can\nbe generated without introducing a hierarchically small neutrino mass. The\nfinal baryon asymmetry is related to the mu-term, and hence linked to the level\nof electroweak fine-tuning. We also show the PQ breaking scalar dynamics that\nkeeps a large PQ breaking scale during inflation and lepton number generation.\nThe mu-term generating superpotential plays an important role for preserving\nthe lepton asymmetry during saxion oscillation. In this scenario, the axion\nisocurvature perturbation is naturally suppressed.\n", "  We investigate the effect of scalar leptoquarks and family non-universal\n$Z^\\prime$ boson on the rare leptonic decays of $B_{s, d}^*$ mesons, mediated\nby the FCNC transitions $b \\to (d, s) l^+ l^-$. They are sensitive to a variety\nof new physics operators as opposed to the $B_{s,d}$ leptonic modes and hence,\ncan provide an ideal testing ground to look for new physics beyond the standard\nmodel. We work out the constraint on new physics parameter space using the\nmeasured branching ratios of $B_{d, s} \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ processes and the $B_q\n- \\bar B_q$ mixing data. Using the constrained parameters we estimate the\nbranching ratios of $B_{d,s} \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-~(e^+ e^-)$ processes. We find that\nthe branching ratios are reasonably enhanced from their corresponding standard\nmodel values in the $X(3,2,1/6)$ leptoquark model and are expected to be within\nthe reach of Run II/III of LHC experiments.\n", "  Hadron-nucleus amplitudes at high energies are studied in the \"toy\" Regge\nmodel in zero transverse dimension for finite nuclei, when the standard series\nof fan diagrams is converted into a finite sum and looses physical sense at\nquite low energies. Taking into account all the loop contributions by numerical\nmethods we find a physically meaningful amplitudes at all energies. They\npractically coincide with the amplitudes for infinite nuclei. A surprizing\nresult is that for finite nuclei and small enough triple pomeron coupling the\ninfinite series of fan diagrams describes the amplitude quite well in spite of\nthe fact that in reality the series should be cut and as such deprived of any\nphysical sense at high energies.\n", "  NGC 147 and NGC 185 are two of the most massive satellites of the Andromeda\ngalaxy (M 31). Close together in the sky, of similar mass and morphological\ntype dE, they possess different amounts of interstellar gas and tidal\ndistortion. The question therefore is, how do their histories compare? Here we\npresent the first reconstruction of the star formation histories of NGC 147 and\nNGC 185 using long-period variable stars. These represent the final phase of\nevolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars at the asymptotic giant branch,\nwhen their luminosity is related to their birth mass. Combining near-infrared\nphotometry with stellar evolution models, we construct the mass function and\nhence the star formation history. For NGC 185 we found that the main epoch of\nstar formation occurred 8.3 Gyr ago, followed by a much lower, but relatively\nconstant star formation rate. In the case of NGC 147, the star formation rate\npeaked only 7 Gyr ago, staying intense until ~ 3 Gyr ago, but no star formation\nhas occurred for at least 300 Myr. Despite their similar masses, NGC 147 has\nevolved more slowly than NGC 185 initially, but more dramatically in more\nrecent times. This is corroborated by the strong tidal distortions of NGC 147\nand the presence of gas in the centre of NGC 185.\n", "  This work studies the magnetic activity of the late-type giant 37 Com. This\nstar belongs to the group of weak G-band stars that present very strong carbon\ndeficiency in their photospheres. The paper is a part of a global investigation\ninto the properties and origin of magnetic fields in cool giants.\n  We use spectropolarimetric data, which allows the simultaneous measurement of\nthe longitudinal magnetic field $B_{l}$, line activity indicators (H$\\alpha$,\nCa\\,{\\sc ii} IRT, S-index) and radial velocity of the star, and consequently\nperform a direct comparison of their time variability. Mean Stokes V profiles\nare extracted using the least squares deconvolution (LSD) method. One map of\nthe surface magnetic field of the star is reconstructed via the Zeeman Doppler\nimaging (ZDI) inversion technique.\n  A periodogram analysis is performed on our dataset and it reveals a rotation\nperiod of 111 days. We interpret this period to be the rotation period of 37\nCom. The reconstructed magnetic map reveals that the structure of the surface\nmagnetic field is complex and features a significant toroidal component. The\ntime variability of the line activity indicators, radial velocity and magnetic\nfield $B_{l}$ indicates a possible evolution of the surface magnetic structures\nin the period from 2008 to 2011. For completeness of our study, we use\ncustomized stellar evolutionary models suited to a weak G-band star. Synthetic\nspectra are also calculated to confirm the peculiar abundance of 37 Com.\n  We deduce that 37 Com is a 6.5~$M_{\\odot}$ weak G-band star located in the\nHertzsprung gap, whose magnetic activity is probably due to dynamo action.\n", "  The action for a Galilean superstring is found from a non-relativistic limit\nof the closed Green-Schwarz (GS) superstring; it has zero tension and provides\nan example of a massless super-Galilean system A Wess-Zumino term leads to a\ntopological central charge in the Galilean supersymmetry algebra, such that\nunitarity requires a upper bound on the total momentum. This Galilean-invariant\nbound, which is also implied by the classical phase-space constraints, is\nsaturated by solutions of the superstring equations of motion that\nhalf-preserve supersymmetry. We discuss briefly the extension to the Galilean\nsupermembrane.\n", "  In this study we present our preliminary report on the scintillation\nproperties of new Ce-doped Tl2LaBr5 single crystal. Two zones vertical Bridgman\ntechnique is used for the growth of this compound. Pure and Ce-doped samples\nshowed maximum emission peaks at 435 nm and 415 nm, respectively. Best light\nyield of 43,000+-4300 ph/MeV with 6.3% (FWHM) energy resolution is obtained for\n5% Ce-doped sample under {\\gamma}-ray excitation. Single exponential decay time\nconstant of 25 ns is observed for 5% Ce doped sample. Effective Z-number is\nfound to be 67, therefore efficient detection of X- and {\\gamma}-ray will be\npossible. Preliminary results revealed that this compound will be an ideal\ncandidate for the medical imaging techniques. Further investigations are under\nway for the determination of optimized conditions of this compound.\n", "  Boundary correlation functions provide insight into the emergence of an\neffective geometry in higher spin gravity duals of O(N) or U(N) symmetric field\ntheories. On a compact manifold, the singlet constraint leads to nontrivial\ndynamics at finite temperature and large N phase transitions even at vanishing\n't Hooft coupling. At low temperature, the leading behavior of boundary\ntwo-point functions is consistent with propagation through a bulk thermal anti\nde Sitter space. Above the phase transition, the two-point function shows\nsignificant departure from thermal AdS space and the emergence of localized\nblack hole like objects in the bulk. In adjoint models, these objects appear at\nlength scales of order of the AdS radius, consistent with a Hawking-Page\ntransition, but in vector models they are parametrically larger than the AdS\nscale. In low dimensions, we find another crossover at large distances beyond\nwhich the correlation function again takes a thermal AdS form, albeit with a\ntemperature dependent normalization factor.\n", "  We study the spectrum, resonances and scattering matrix of a quantum\nhamiltonian on a \"hybrid surface\" consisting of a half-line attached by its\nendpoint to the vertex of a concave planar wedge. At the boundary of the wedge,\noutside the vertex, Dirichlet boundary are imposed. The system is tunable by\nvarying the measure of the angle at the vertex.\n", "  Using the atomic force microscope based break junction approach, applicable\nto metal point contacts and single molecule junctions, measurements can be\nrepeated thousands of times resulting in rich data sets characterizing the\nproperties of an ensemble of nanoscale junction structures. This paper focuses\non the relationship between the measured force extension characteristics\nincluding bond rupture and the properties of the interface bonds in the\njunction. A set of exemplary model junction structures have been analyzed using\ndensity functional theory based calculations to simulate the adiabatic\npotential surface that governs the junction elongation. The junction structures\ninclude representative molecules that bond to the electrodes through amine,\nmethylsulfide and pyridine links. The force extension characteristics are shown\nto be most effectively analyzed in a scaled form with maximum sustainable force\nand the distance between the force zero and force maximum as scale factors.\nWidely used, two parameter models for chemical bond potential energy versus\nbond length are found to be nearly identical in scaled form. Furthermore, they\nfit well to the present calculations of N-Au and S-Au donor-acceptor bonds,\nprovided no other degrees of freedom are allowed to relax. Examination of the\nreduced problem of a single interface, but including relaxation of atoms\nproximal to the interface bond, shows that a single-bond potential form\nrenormalized by an effective harmonic potential in series fits well to the\ncalculated results. This allows relatively accurate extraction of the interface\nbond energy. Analysis of full junction models show cooperative effects that go\nbeyond the series inclusion of the second bond in the junction, the spectator\nbond that does not rupture.\n", "  We study the effect of the nucleon meson cloud on centrality dependence of\nthe jet nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$. We find that the meson-baryon\nFock components may lead to a noticeable deviation of $R_{pA}$ from unity. Our\nresults for $R_{pA}$ show the same tendency as that observed by ATLAS in $p+Pb$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. The meson cloud suppresses the central jet\nevents and enhances the peripheral jet events. But quantitatively the effect is\nsomewhat smaller than in the data.\n", "  In the $SO(5)\\times U(1)$ gauge-Higgs unification (GHU), Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nexcited states of charged and neutral vector bosons, $W^{(1)}$, $W_R^{(1)}$,\n$Z^{(1)}$, $\\gamma^{(1)}$ and $Z_R^{(1)}$, can be observed as $W'$ and $Z'$\nsignals in collider experiments. In this paper we evaluate the decay rates of\nthe $W'$ and $Z'$, and $s$-channel cross sections mediated by $W'$ and $Z'$\nbosons with final states involving the standard model (SM) fermion pair ($\\ell\n\\nu$, $\\ell\\bar{\\ell}$, $q\\bar{q}'$), $WH$, $ZH$, $WW$ and $WZ$. $W'$ and $Z'$\nresonances appear around 6.0 TeV (8.5 TeV) for $\\theta_H=0.115$ (0.0737) where\n$\\theta_H$ is the Aharonov-Bohm phase in the fifth dimension in GHU. For decay\nrates we find $\\Gamma(W'\\to WH) \\simeq \\Gamma(W'\\to WZ)$ ($W'=W^{(1)}$,\n$W_R^{(1)}$), $\\Gamma(W^{(1)}\\to WH,WZ) \\sim\\Gamma(W_R^{(1)}\\to WH,WZ)$,\n$\\Gamma(Z^{(1)}\\to ZH) \\simeq\\sum_{Z'=Z^{(1)},\\gamma^{(1)}}\\Gamma(Z'\\to WW)$,\nand $\\Gamma(Z_R^{(1)}\\to ZH) \\simeq \\Gamma(Z_R^{(1)}\\to WW)$. $W'$ and $Z'$\nsignals of GHU can be best found at the LHC experiment in the processes $pp\\to\nW' (Z')+X$ followed by $W'\\to t\\bar{b}$, $WH$, and $Z'\\to e^+ e^-$,\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-, ZH$. For the lighter $Z'$ ($\\theta_H = 0.115$) case, with\nforthcoming 30 fb$^{-1}$ data of the 13 TeV LHC experiment we expect about ten\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ events for the invariant mass range 3 to 7 TeV, though the number\nof the events becomes much smaller when $\\theta_H=0.0737$. In the process with\n$WZ$ in the final state, it is confirmed that the unitarity is preserved,\nprovided that all KK excited intermediate states are taken into account.\nDeviation of the $WWZ$ coupling from the SM is very tiny. Exotic partners\n$t_T^{(1)}$ and $b_Y^{(1)}$ of the top and bottom quarks with electric charge\n$+5/3$ and $-4/3$ have mass $M_{t_T^{(1)},b_Y^{(1)}}\\simeq 4-5$ TeV, becoming\nthe lightest non-SM particles in GHU which can be singly produced in collider\nexperiments.\n", "  The properties of the vacuum are described by quantum physics including the\nresponse to external fields such as electromagnetic radiation. Of the two\nparameters that govern the details of the electromagnetic field dynamics in\nvacuum, one is fixed by the requirement of Lorentz invariance $c=\n1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{0} \\mu_{0}}$. The other one, $Z_{0}=\n\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}/\\varepsilon_{0}} = 1/(c\\varepsilon_{0})$ and its relation to the\nquantum vacuum, is discussed in this contribution. Deriving $\\varepsilon_{0}$\nfrom the properties of the quantum vacuum implies the derivation of the fine\nstructure constant.\n", "  We consider the symmetric and broken phases of light-front $\\phi^4$ theory in\ntwo dimensions. In both cases the mass of the lowest state is computed and its\ndependence on the coupling used to infer critical coupling values. The\nstructure of the eigenstate is examined to determine whether it shows the signs\nof critical behavior, specifically whether the one-body sector becomes\nimprobable relative to the higher Fock sectors. In attempts to establish this\nbehavior, we consider both sector-independent and sector-dependent constituent\nmasses.\n", "  In electronic structure theory, the availability of analytical derivative is\none of the desired features for a method to be useful in practical\napplications, as it allows for geometry optimization as well as computation of\nmolecular properties. With the recent advances in the development of\nsymmetry-projected Hartree-Fock (PHF) methods, we here aim at further\nextensions by devising the analytic gradients of post-PHF approaches with a\nspecial focus on spin-extended (spin-projected) configuration interaction with\nsingle and double substitutions (ECISD). Just like standard single-reference\nmethods, the mean-field PHF part does not require the corresponding\ncoupled-perturbed equation to be solved, while the correlation energy term\nneeds the orbital relaxation effect to be accounted for, unless the underlying\nmolecular orbitals are variationally optimized in the presence of the\ncorrelation energy. We present a general strategy for post-PHF analytical\ngradients, which closely parallels that for single-reference methods, yet\naddressing the major difference between them. The similarity between ECISD and\nmulti-reference CI not only in the energy but also in the optimized geometry is\nclearly demonstrated by the numerical examples of ozone and cyclobutadiene.\n", "  Quartz tuning forks are high-quality mechanical oscillators widely used in\nlow temperature physics as viscometers, thermometers and pressure sensors. We\ndemonstrate that a fork placed in liquid helium near the surface of solid\nhelium is very sensitive to the oscillations of the solid-liquid interface. We\ndeveloped a double-resonance read-out technique which allowed us to detect\noscillations of the surface with an accuracy of 1 Angs in 10 sec. Using this\ntechnique we have investigated crystallization waves in 4He down to 10 mK. In\ncontrast to previous studies of crystallization waves, our measurement scheme\nhas very low dissipation, on the order of 20 pW, which allows us to carry out\nexperiments even at sub-mK temperatures. We propose to use this scheme in the\nsearch for crystallization waves in 3He, which exist only at temperatures well\nbelow 0.5 mK.\n", "  Harmonic lasing is a perspective mode of operation of X-ray FEL user\nfacilities that allows to provide brilliant beams of higher energy photons for\nuser experiments. Another useful application of harmonic lasing is so called\nHarmonic Lasing Self-Seeded Free Electron Laser (HLSS FEL) that allows to\nimprove spectral brightness of these facilities. In the past, harmonic lasing\nhas been demonstrated in the FEL oscillators in infrared and visible wavelength\nranges, but not in high-gain FELs and not at short wavelengths. In this paper\nwe report on the first evidence of the harmonic lasing and the first operation\nof the HLSS FEL at the soft X-ray FEL user facility FLASH in the wavelength\nrange between 4.5 nm and 15 nm. Spectral brightness was improved in comparison\nwith Self-Amplified Spontaneous emission (SASE) FEL by a factor of six in the\nexponential gain regime. A better performance of HLSS FEL with respect to SASE\nFEL in the post-saturation regime with a tapered undulator was observed as\nwell. The first demonstration of harmonic lasing in a high-gain FEL and at\nshort wavelengths paves the way for a variety of applications of this new\noperation mode in X-ray FELs.\n", "  Ratios of top-quark pair to $Z$-boson cross sections measured from\nproton--proton collisions at the LHC centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt\ns=13$TeV, 8TeV, and 7TeV are presented by the ATLAS Collaboration. Single\nratios, at a given $\\sqrt s$ for the two processes and at different $\\sqrt s$\nfor each process, as well as double ratios of the two processes at different\n$\\sqrt s$, are evaluated. The ratios are constructed using previously published\nATLAS measurements of the $t\\overline{t}$ and $Z$-boson production cross\nsections, corrected to a common phase space where required, and a new analysis\nof $Z \\rightarrow \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ where $\\ell=e,\\mu$ at $\\sqrt s=13$TeV\nperformed with data collected in 2015 with an integrated luminosity of\n$3.2$fb$^{-1}$. Correlations of systematic uncertainties are taken into account\nwhen evaluating the uncertainties in the ratios. The correlation model is also\nused to evaluate the combined cross section of the $Z\\rightarrow e^+e^-$ and\nthe $Z\\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ channels for each $\\sqrt s$ value. The results\nare compared to calculations performed at next-to-next-to-leading-order\naccuracy using recent sets of parton distribution functions. The data\ndemonstrate significant power to constrain the gluon distribution function for\nthe Bjorken-$x$ values near 0.1 and the light-quark sea for $x<0.02$.\n", "  The low activation energy associated with amorphous chalcogenide structures\noffers broad tunability of material properties with laser-based or thermal\nprocessing. In this paper, we study near-bandgap laser induced anisotropic\ncrystallization in solution processed arsenic sulfide. The modified electronic\nbandtail states associated with laser irritation lead to a distinctive\nphotoluminescence spectrum, compared to thermally annealed amorphous glass.\nLaser crystalized materials exhibit a periodic subwavelength ripples structure\nin transmission electron microscopy experiments and show polarization dependent\nphotoluminescence. Analysis of the local atomic structure of these materials\nusing laboratory-based X-ray pair distribution function analysis indicates that\nlaser irradiation causes a slight rearrangement at the atomic length scale,\nwith a small percentage of S-S homopolar bonds converting to As-S heteropolar\nbonds. These results highlight fundamental differences between laser and\nthermal processing in this important class of materials.\n", "  The three-body scattering problem in Coulombic systems is widespread, however\nyet unresolved problem by the mathematically rigorous methods. In this work\nthis long term challenge has been undertaken by combining distorted waves and\nFaddeev-Merkuriev equation formalisms in conjunction with the complex scaling\ntechnique to overcome difficulties related with the boundary conditions. Unlike\nthe common belief, it is demonstrated that the smooth complex scaling method\ncan be applied to solve three-body Coulomb scattering problem in a wide energy\nregion, including fully elastic domain and extending to the energies well\nbeyond atom ionization threshold.\n  Newly developed method is used to study electron scattering on ground states\nof Hydrogen and Positronium atoms as well as a $e^+$+H(n=1) $\\rightleftarrows$\np+Ps(n=1) reaction. Where available, obtained results are compared with the\nexperimental data and theoretical predictions, proving accuracy and efficiency\nof the newly developed method.\n", "  Muography techniques applied to geological structures greatly improved in the\npast ten years. Recent applications demonstrate the interest of the method not\nonly to perform structural imaging but also to monitor the dynamics of inner\nmovements like magma ascent inside volcanoes or density variations in\nhydrothermal systems. Muography time-resolution has been studied thanks to\ndedicated experiments, e.g. in a water tower tank. This paper presents the\nactivities of the DIAPHANE collaboration between particle- and geo-physicists\nand the most recent results obtained in the field of volcanology, with a focus\non the main target, the Soufri\\`ere of Guadeloupe active volcano. Special\nemphasis is given on the monitoring of the dome's inner volumes opacity\nvariations, that could be inferred to the hydrothermal system dynamics\n(vaporization of inner liquid water in coincidence with the appearance of new\nfumaroles at the summit). I also breifly present results obtained in the fields\nof civil engineering (study of urban underground tunnels) and archaelogy (greek\ntumulus scanning).\n", "  HOLMES is a new experiment aiming at directly measuring the neutrino mass\nwith a sensitivity below 2 eV. HOLMES will perform a calorimetric measurement\nof the energy released in the decay of $^{163}$Ho. The calorimetric measurement\neliminates systematic uncertainties arising from the use of external beta\nsources, as in experiments with spectrometers. This measurement was proposed in\n1982 by A. De Rujula and M. Lusignoli, but only recently the detector\ntechnological progress has allowed to design a sensitive experiment. HOLMES\nwill deploy a large array of low temperature microcalorimeters with implanted\n$^{163}$Ho nuclei. HOLMES, besides being an important step forward in the\ndirect neutrino mass measurement with a calorimetric approach, will also\nestablish the potential of this approach to extend the sensitivity down to 0.1\neV and lower. In its final configuration HOLMES will collect about $3\\cdot\n10^{13}$ decays with 1000 detectors characterized by an instrumental energy\nresolution of the order of few eV and a time resolution of few microseconds. To\nembed the $^{163}$Ho into the gold absorbers a custom mass separator ion\nimplanter is being developed. The detectors used for the HOLMES experiment will\nbe Mo/Cu bilayers TESs (Transition Edge Sensors) on SiN$_x$ membrane with gold\nabsorbers. Microwave multiplexed rf-SQUIDs are the best available technique to\nread out large array of such detectors. An extensive R&D activity is in\nprogress in order to maximize the multiplexing factor while preserving the\nperformances of the individual detectors. The current activities are focused on\nthe the single detector performances optimization and on the $^{163}$Ho isotope\nproduction and embedding. A preliminary measurement of a sub-array of $4\\times\n16$ detectors is planned late in 2017. In this contribution we present the\nHOLMES project with its technical challenges, its status and perspectives.\n", "  Quantitative calculations of the properties of hadrons and nuclei, with\nassessed uncertainties, have emerged as competitive with experimental\nmeasurements in a number of major cases. We may well be entering an era where\ntheoretical predictions are critical for experimental progress.\nCross-fertilization between the fields of relativistic hadronic structure and\nnon-relativistic nuclear structure is readily apparent. Non-perturbative\nrenormalization methods such as Similarity Renormalization Group and\nOkubo-Lee-Suzuki schemes as well as many-body methods such as Coupled Cluster,\nConfiguration Interaction and Lattice Simulation methods are now employed and\nadvancing in both major areas of physics. New algorithms to apply these\napproaches on supercomputers are shared among these areas of physics. The roads\nto success have intertwined with each community taking the lead at various\ntimes in the recent past. I briefly sketch these fascinating paths and comment\non some symbiotic relationships. I also overview some recent results from the\nHamiltonian Basis Light-Front Quantization approach.\n", "  Two Higgs doublet extensions of the standard model, such as supersymmetry,\npredict the existence of charged Higgs bosons. We explore the reach for\nTeV-scale charged Higgs bosons through their associated production with top\nquarks, and their decay to boosted top jets and $\\mu_x$ tagged boosted bottom\njets, at a 14 TeV CERN Large Hadron Collider and at a 100 TeV Future Circular\nCollider. In particular, we show the moderate $\\tan\\beta$ \"wedge\" region of\nparameter space cannot be probed at the Large Hadron Collider for TeV-scale\n$H^\\pm$ because the cross section is too small. However, a 100 TeV future\nproton collider can close the wedge region below 2 TeV, and search for $H^\\pm$\nup to 6 TeV.\n", "  We calculate quark Wigner distributions using the light-front wave functions\nin a dressed quark model. In this model, a proton target is replaced by a\nsimplified spin-1/2 state, namely a quark dressed with a gluon. We calculate\nthe Wigner distributions for different polarization configuration of quark and\nthe target state in this model.\n", "  Optical spectroscopy techniques such as differential reflectance and\ntransmittance have proven to be very powerful techniques to study 2D materials.\nHowever, a thorough description of the experimental setups needed to carry out\nthese measurements is lacking in the literature. We describe a versatile\noptical microscope setup to carry out differential reflectance and\ntransmittance spectroscopy in 2D materials with a lateral resolution of ~1\nmicron in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum. We demonstrate\nthe potential of the presented setup to determine the number of layers of 2D\nmaterials and to characterize their fundamental optical properties such as\nexcitonic resonances. We illustrate its performance by studying mechanically\nexfoliated and chemical vapor-deposited transition metal dichalcogenide\nsamples.\n", "  The temporary resistance triggered by phase slip will result in the switching\nof superconductor nanowire to a permanent normal state, decreasing the\nswitching current. In this letter, we propose an improved impedance matching\ncircuit that releases the transition triggered by phase slips to the load\nresistor through the RF port of a bias tee. The transportation properties with\ndifferent load resistors indicate that the switching current decreases due to\nthe reflection caused by impedance mismatching, and is maximized by optimized\nimpedance matching. Compared to the same setup without impedance matching\ncircuit, the switching current was increased from 8.0 micro A to 12.2 micro A\nin a niobium nitride nanowire after releasing the temporary transition\ntriggered by phase slips. The leakage process with impedance matching outputs a\nvoltage pulse which enables the user to directly register the transition\ntriggered by phase slips. The technique for maximizing the switching current\nhas potential practical application in superconductor devices, and the\ntechnique for counting phase slips may be applied to explore the quantum\nbehavior of phase slips.\n", "  Context: Constraints on the internal rotation of red giants are now available\nthanks to asteroseismic observations. Preliminary comparisons with rotating\nstellar models indicate that an undetermined additional process for the\ninternal transport of angular momentum is required in addition to purely\nhydrodynamic processes. Aims: We investigate how asteroseismic measurements of\nred giants can help us characterize the additional transport mechanism.\nMethods: We first determine the efficiency of the missing transport mechanism\nfor the low-mass red giant KIC 7341231 by computing rotating models that\ninclude an additional viscosity corresponding to this process. We then discuss\nthe change in the efficiency of this transport of angular momentum with the\nmass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Results: In the case of the low-mass\nred giant KIC 7341231, we find that the viscosity corresponding to the\nadditional mechanism is constrained to the range 1 x 10^3 - 1.3 x 10^4 cm^2/s.\nThis constraint on the efficiency of the unknown additional transport mechanism\nduring the post-main sequence is obtained independently of any specific\nassumption about the modelling of rotational effects during the pre-main\nsequence and the main sequence (in particular, the braking of the surface by\nmagnetized winds and the efficiency of the internal transport of angular\nmomentum before the post-main-sequence phase). When we assume that the\nadditional transport mechanism is at work during the whole evolution of the\nstar together with a solar-calibrated braking of the surface by magnetized\nwinds, the range of nu_add is reduced to 1 - 4 x 10^3 cm^2/s. In addition to\nbeing sensitive to the evolutionary stage of the star, we show that the\nefficiency of the unknown process for internal transport of angular momentum\nincreases with the stellar mass.\n", "  We discuss contributions to neutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay\ninvolving vector bosons. The starting point is a list of all possible vector\nrepresentations that may contribute to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay via $d=9$ or\n$d=11$ operators at tree-level. We then identify gauge groups which contain\nthese vectors in the adjoint representation. Even though the complete list of\nvector fields that can contribute to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ up to $d=11$ is large (a\ntotal of 46 vectors), only a few of them can be gauge bosons of\nphenomenologically realistic groups. These latter cases are discussed in some\nmore detail, and lower (upper) limits on gauge boson masses (mixing angles) are\nderived from the absence of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay.\n", "  The availability of big data in materials science offers new routes for\nanalyzing materials properties and functions and achieving scientific\nunderstanding. Finding structure in these data that is not directly visible by\nstandard tools and exploitation of the scientific information requires new and\ndedicated methodology based on approaches from statistical learning, compressed\nsensing, and other recent methods from applied mathematics, computer science,\nstatistics, signal processing, and information science. In this paper, we\nexplain and demonstrate a compressed-sensing based methodology for feature\nselection, specifically for discovering physical descriptors, i.e., physical\nparameters that describe the material and its properties of interest, and\nassociated equations that explicitly and quantitatively describe those relevant\nproperties. As showcase application and proof of concept, we describe how to\nbuild a physical model for the quantitative prediction of the crystal structure\nof binary compound semiconductors.\n", "  Discussed in the present study are details of the behavior of low-frequency\n\"acoustic\" ($ac$) modes in the spectrum of edge magnetoplasma oscillations in\naxially symmetric degenerate 2D electron systems where electron density\ndistribution $n(\\vec r)$ behaves as $n(\\vec r \\to R)\\to 0$ when $r$ approaches\nthe external radius $R$ of the domain occupied by electrons. It is shown that\nfinding the dependence of the spectrum of $ac$-modes on radial ($l$) and\nazimuthal ($m$) indices when both $l$ and $m$ are small requires axially\nsymmetric solution of the relevant problem. The desires is achieved in the\nso-called elliptic approximation for electron density distribution $n(\\vec r)$.\nThe obtained results are employed to interpret available data on the excitation\nof $ac$-modes in degenerate electron disks with smooth electron density profile\nplaced in the magnetic field $H$ normal to the disk plane. The performed\nanalysis confirms reported detection of the soft $ac$-mode in the range of $H\n\\gg H_{max}$ where $H_{max}$ is the field at which the maximum of the\n$\\omega_{lm}^{s}(H)$ curve is observed (here and below $\\omega_{lm}^{s}(H)$\nstands for the frequency of the soft $ac$-mode).\n  A strong interaction of the $ac$-modes with $(integer)$-channels inevitably\narising near the boundaries of 2D electron systems with smooth electron density\nprofile as the magnetic field is varied in the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) regime\nis emphasized. Well-formed $integer$-stripes can suppress some acoustic modes\nwhich is actually observed in experiments.\n", "  We determine the dependence of important parameters for critical fluctuations\non temperature and baryon chemical potential in the QCD phase diagram. The\nanalysis is based on an identification of the fluctuations of the order\nparameter obtained from the Ising model equation of state and the\nGinzburg-Landau effective potential approach. The impact of the mapping from\nIsing model variables to QCD thermodynamics is discussed.\n", "  Yang-Baxter relations symmetric with respect to the ortho-symplectic\nsuperalgebras are studied. We start from the formulation of graded algebras and\nthe linear superspace carrying the vector (fundamental) representation of the\northo-symplectic supergroup. On this basis we study the analogy of the\nYang-Baxter operators considered earlier for the cases of orthogonal and\nsymplectic symmetries: the vector (fundamental) R matrix, the L operator\ndefining the Yangian algebra and its first and second order evaluations. We\ninvestigate the condition for L(u) in the case of the truncated expansion in\ninverse powers of u and give examples of Lie algebra representations obeying\nthese conditions. We construct the R operator intertwining two super-spinor\nrepresentations and study the fusion of L operators involving the tensor\nproduct of such representations.\n", "  We examine how the cosmic environment affects the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies in the Universe by comparing the N/O ratio of dwarf galaxies in voids\nwith dwarf galaxies in more dense regions. Ratios of the forbidden [O III] and\n[S II] transitions provide estimates of a region's electron temperature and\nnumber density. We estimate the abundances of oxygen and nitrogen using these\ntemperature and density estimates and the emission line fluxes [O II] 3727, [O\nIII] 4959, 5007, and [N II] 6548, 6584 with the direct Te method. Using\nspectroscopic observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we\nare able to estimate the N/O ratio in 42 void dwarf galaxies and 89 dwarf\ngalaxies in more dense regions. The N/O ratio for void dwarfs (Mr > -17) is\nslightly lower (12%) than for dwarf galaxies in denser regions. We also\nestimate the nitrogen and oxygen abundances of 2050 void galaxies and 3883\ngalaxies in more dense regions with Mr > -20. These somewhat brighter galaxies\n(but still fainter than L*) also display similar minor shifts in the N/O ratio.\nThe shifts in the average and median element abundance values in all absolute\nmagnitude bins studied are in the same direction, suggesting that the\nlarge-scale environment may influence the chemical evolution of galaxies. We\ndiscuss possible causes of such a large-scale environmental dependence of the\nchemical evolution of galaxies, including retarded star formation and a higher\ndark matter halo mass to stellar mass ratio in void galaxies.\n", "  The recent experimental progresses in handling microscopic systems have\nallowed to probe them at levels where fluctuations are prominent, calling for\nstochastic modeling in a large number of physical, chemical and biological\nphenomena. This has provided fruitful applications for established stochastic\nmethods and motivated further developments. These systems often involve\nprocesses taking place on widely separated time scales. For an efficient\nmodeling one usually focuses on the slower degrees of freedom and it is of\ngreat importance to accurately eliminate the fast variables in a controlled\nfashion, carefully accounting for their net effect on the slower dynamics. This\nprocedure in general requires to perform two different operations: decimation\nand coarse-graining. We introduce the asymptotic methods that form the basis of\nthis procedure and discuss their application to a series of physical,\nbiological and chemical examples. We then turn our attention to functionals of\nthe stochastic trajectories such as residence times, counting statistics,\nfluxes, entropy production, etc. which have been increasingly studied in recent\nyears. For such functionals, the elimination of the fast degrees of freedom can\npresent additional difficulties and naive procedures can lead to blatantly\ninconsistent results. Homogenization techniques for functionals are less\ncovered in the literature and we will pedagogically present them here, as\nnatural extensions of the ones employed for the trajectories. We will also\ndiscuss recent applications of these techniques to the thermodynamics of small\nsystems and their interpretation in terms of information-theoretic concepts.\n", "  We study fluid structure and water-like anomalies of a system constituted by\ndimeric particles interacting via a purely repulsive core-softened potential by\nmeans of integral equation theories. In our model, dimers interact through a\nrepulsive pair potential of inverse-power form with a softened repulsion\nstrength. By employing the Ornstein-Zernike approach and the reference\ninteraction site model (RISM) theory, we study the behavior of water-like\nanomalies upon progressively increasing the elongation {\\lambda} of the dimers\nfrom the monomeric case ({\\lambda} = 0) to the tangent configuration ({\\lambda}\n= 1). For each value of the elongation we consider two different values of the\ninteraction potential, corresponding to one and two length scales, with the aim\nto provide a comprehensive description of the possible fluid scenarios of this\nmodel. Our theoretical results are systematically compared with already\nexisting or newly generated Monte Carlo data: we find that theories and\nsimulations agree in providing the picture of a fluid exhibiting density and\nstructural anomalies for low values of {\\lambda} and for both the two values of\nthe interaction potential. Integral equation theories give accurate predictions\nfor pressure and radial distribution functions, whereas the temperatures where\nanomalies occur are underestimated. Upon increasing the elongation, the RISM\ntheory still predicts the existence of anomalies; the latter are no longer\nobserved in simulations, since their development is likely precluded by the\nonset of crystallization. We discuss our results in terms of the reliability of\nintegral equation theories in predicting the existence of water-like anomalies\nin core-softened fluids.\n", "  We discuss quantum radiation of a massless scalar field from a spherically\nsymmetric nonsingular black hole with finite lifetime. Namely, we discuss a\nsandwich black-hole model, where a black hole is originally created by a\ncollapse of a null shell of mass $M$, and later, after some time $\\Delta V$, it\nis disrupted by the collapse of the other shell with negative mass $-M$. We\nassume that between the shells the metric is static and either coincides with\nthe Hayward metric or with a special generalization of it. We show that in both\ncases for sufficiently large parameter $\\Delta V$ the radiation after the\nformation of the black hole practically coincides with the Hawking result. We\nalso calculated the radiation, emitted from the black hole interior. This\nradiation contains peak at the moment when the second shell intersects the\ninner horizon. In the standard sandwich metric (with the Hayward interior) this\noutburst of the energy is exponentially large. In the modified metric, which\nincludes additional non-trivial redshift parameter, this exponent is\nsuppressed. This is a result of significant decrease of the surface gravity of\nthe inner horizon in the latter case. We discuss possible consequences of this\nresult in context of the self-consistency requirement for nonsingular models\nwith quantum radiation.\n", "  We propose a minimal extension of the standard model which includes only one\nadditional complex scalar field, flavon, with flavor-dependent global U(1)\nsymmetry. It not only explains the hierarchical flavor structure in the quark\nand lepton sector (including neutrino sector), but also solves the strong CP\nproblem by identifying the CP-odd component of the flavon as the QCD axion,\nwhich we call flaxion. Furthermore, the flaxion model solves the cosmological\npuzzles in the standard model, i.e., origin of dark matter, baryon asymmetry of\nthe universe, and inflation. We show that the radial component of the flavon\ncan play the role of inflaton without isocurvature nor domain wall problems.\nThe dark matter abundance can be explained by the flaxion coherent oscillation,\nwhile the baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated through leptogenesis.\n", "  Single photon sources are an integral part of various quantum technologies,\nand solid state quantum emitters at room temperature appear as a promising\nimplementation. We couple the fluorescence of individual silicon vacancy\ncenters in nanodiamonds to a tunable optical microcavity to demonstrate a\nsingle photon source with high efficiency, increased emission rate, and\nimproved spectral purity compared to the intrinsic emitter properties. We use a\nfiber-based microcavity with a mode volume as small as $3.4~\\lambda^3$ and a\nquality factor of $1.9\\times 10^4$ and observe an effective Purcell factor of\nup to 9.2. We furthermore study modifications of the internal rate dynamics and\npropose a rate model that closely agrees with the measurements. We observe\nlifetime changes of up to 31%, limited by the finite quantum efficiency of the\nemitters studied here. With improved materials, our achieved parameters predict\nsingle photon rates beyond 1 GHz.\n", "  We present analytical five-loop results for the quark mass and quark field\nanomalous dimensions, for a general gauge group and in the MSbar scheme. We\nconfirm the values known for the gauge group SU(3) from an independent\ncalculation, and find full agreement with results available from large-Nf\nstudies.\n", "  We calculate the radiative heat transfer between two identical metallic\none-dimensional lamellar gratings. To this aim we present and exploit a\nmodification to the widely-used Fourier modal method, known as adaptive spatial\nresolution, based on a stretch of the coordinate associated to the periodicity\nof the grating. We first show that this technique dramatically improves the\nrate of convergence when calculating the heat flux, allowing to explore smaller\nseparations. We then present a study of heat flux as a function of the grating\nheight, highlighting a remarkable amplification of the exchanged energy,\nascribed to the appearance of spoof-plasmon modes, whose behavior is also\nspectrally investigated. Differently from previous works, our method allows us\nto explore a range of grating heights extending over several orders of\nmagnitude. By comparing our results to recent studies we find a consistent\nquantitative disagreement with some previously obtained results going up to\n50\\%. In some cases, this disagreement is explained in terms of an incorrect\nconnection between the reflection operators of the two gratings.\n", "  We study numerically formation of spatial optical solitons in nematic liquid\ncrystals with competing nonlocal nonlinearities. We demonstrate that at the\nsufficiently high input power the interplay between focusing and thermally\ninduced defocusing may lead to the formation of two-peak fundamental spatial\nsolitons. These solitons have constant spatial phase and hence represent\nsupermodes of the self-induced extended waveguide structure. We show that these\ntwo-peak solitons are stable in propagation and exhibit adiabatic transition to\na single peak state under weak absorption.\n", "  We use twin photons generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion\n(SPDC) to perform temporal ghost imaging of a single time signal. The retrieval\nof a binary signal containing eight bits is performed with an error rate below\n1%.\n", "  Magnetic resonance spectra of EuTiO3 in both bulk and thin film form were\ntaken at temperatures from 3-350 K and microwave frequencies from 9.2-9.8 and\n34 GHz. In the paramagnetic phase, magnetic resonance spectra are determined by\nmagnetic dipole and exchange interactions between Eu2+ spins. In the film, a\nlarge contribution arises from the demagnetization field. From detailed\nanalysis of the linewidth and its temperature dependence, the parameters of\nspin-spin interactions were determined: the exchange frequency is 15-15.5 GHz\nand the estimated critical exponent of the spin correlation length is ~ 0.5. In\nthe bulk samples, the spectra exhibited a distinct minimum in the linewidth at\nthe N\\'eel temperature, T_N = 5.5 K, while the resonance field practically does\nnot change even on cooling below T_N. This is indicative of a small magnetic\nanisotropy ~ 320 G in the antiferromagnetic phase. In the film, the magnetic\nresonance spectrum is split below T_N into several components due to excitation\nof the magnetostatic modes, corresponding to a non-uniform precession of\nmagnetization. Moreover, the film was observed to degrade over two years. This\nwas manifested by an increase of defects and a change in the domain structure.\nThe saturated magnetization in the film, estimated from the magnetic resonance\nspectrum, was about 900 emu/cm3 or 5.5 mu_B/unit cell at T = 3.5 K.\n", "  The vectorlike top partners $T$ are predicted in many extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM). In a simplified model including a single vectorlike $T$\nquark with charge $2/3$, we investigate the process $pp \\to Tj$ induced by the\ncouplings between the top partner with the first and the third generation\nquarks at the LHC. We find that the mixing with the first generation can\nenhance the production cross section. We further study the observability of the\nsingle heavy top partner through the process $pp \\to T(\\to th)j\\to t(\\to b \\ell\n\\nu_{\\ell})h( \\to \\gamma\\gamma) j$ at the high-luminosity~(HL)-LHC~(a 14 TeV\n$pp$ collider with an integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$). For three typical\nheavy $T$ quark masses $m_T=600,800$ and 1000 GeV, the $3\\sigma$ exclusion\nlimits, as well as the $5\\sigma$ discovery reach in the parameter plane of the\ntwo variables $g^{\\ast}-R_L$, are respectively obtained at the HL-LHC.\n", "  We present a set of formulas to extract the gluon density from the\nBerger-Block-Tan form of the deep inelastic structure function F2 at small x in\nthe leading order of perturbation theory.\n", "  We consider an optical nonlinear interferometric setup based on Young's\ndouble-slit configuration where a nonlinear material is placed exactly after\none of the two slits. We examine the effects of Kerr nonlinearity and\nmulti-photon absorption in the resulting interference pattern. The presence of\nnonlinearity breaks the transverse spatial symmetry of the system, resulting to\na modified intensity pattern at the observation plane as a function of the\nincident intensity. Our theoretical model, based on the modification of the\noptical path due to the presence of nonlinearity, is surprisingly accurate in\npredicting the intensity profile of the main lobes for a wide range of\nparameters. We discuss about potential applications of our model in nonlinear\ninterferometry. Specifically, we show that it is possible to measure both the\nmulti-photon and the Kerr coefficients of a nonlinear material based on the\nspatial translation of the interference pattern as a function of the incident\nintensity.\n", "  We present our detailed spectroscopic analysis of the chemical composition of\nfour red giant stars in the halo globular cluster NGC 6426. We obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra using the Magellan2/MIKE spectrograph, from which we\nderived equivalent widths and subsequently computed abundances of 24 species of\n22 chemical elements. For the purpose of measuring equivalent widths, we\ndeveloped a new semi-automated tool, called EWCODE. We report a mean Fe content\nof [Fe/H] = -2.34$\\pm$0.05 dex (stat.) in accordance with previous studies. At\na mean $\\alpha$-abundance of [(Mg,Si,Ca)/3 Fe] = 0.39$\\pm$0.03 dex, NGC 6426\nfalls on the trend drawn by the Milky Way halo and other globular clusters at\ncomparably low metallicities. The distribution of the lighter $\\alpha$-elements\nas well as the enhanced ratio [Zn/Fe] = 0.39 dex could originate from hypernova\nenrichment of the pre-cluster medium. We find tentative evidence for a spread\nin the elements Mg, Si, and Zn, indicating an enrichment scenario, where ejecta\nof evolved massive stars of a slightly older population polluted a newly born\nyounger one. The heavy element abundances in this cluster fit well into the\npicture of metal-poor globular clusters, which in that respect appear to be\nremarkably homogeneous. The pattern of the neutron-capture elements heavier\nthan Zn point towards an enrichment history governed by the r-process with only\nlittle -if any- sign of s-process contributions. This finding is supported by\nthe striking similarity of our program stars to the metal-poor field star HD\n108317.\n", "  We calculate the stellar energy loss due to neutrino-pair production in\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation in the context of a 331 model, a left-right symmetric\nmodel and a simplest little Higgs model in a way that can be used in supernova\ncalculations. We also present some simple estimates which show that such\nprocess can act as an efficient energy loss mechanism in the shocked supernova\ncore. We find that the stellar energy loss is almost independent on the\nparameters of the models in the allowed range for these parameters. This work\ncomplements other studies on the stellar energy loss rate in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation.\n", "  The heavy baryon $\\Lambda_b $ is regarded as composed of a heavy quark and a\nscalar diquark which has good spin and isospin quantum numbers. In this\npicture, we calculate the electromagnetic (EM) form factors of $\\Lambda_b$ in\nthe Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. We find that the shapes of the EM form\nfactors of $\\Lambda_b$ are similar to those of $\\Lambda$, which have a peak at\nabout $\\omega=1$, but the amplitudes are much smaller than those of $\\Lambda$.\n", "  We offer an explanation for the recently observed pressure-induced magnetic\nstate in the iron-chalcogenide FeSe based on \\textit{ab initio} estimates for\nthe pressure evolution of the most important Coulomb interaction parameters. We\nfind that an increase of pressure leads to an overall decrease mostly in the\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion, which in turn leads to a reduction of the\nnematic order and the generation of magnetic stripe order. We treat the\nconcomitant effects of band renormalization and the induced interplay of\nnematic and magnetic order in a self-consistent way and determine the generic\ntopology of the temperature-pressure phase diagram, and find qualitative\nagreement with the experimentally determined phase diagram.\n", "  The concept of effective particles is introduced in the Minkowski space-time\nHamiltonians in quantum field theory using a new kind of the relativistic\nrenormalization group procedure that does not integrate out high-energy modes\nbut instead integrates out the large changes of invariant mass. The new\nprocedure is explained using examples of known interactions. Some applications\nin phenomenology, including processes measurable in colliders, are briefly\npresented.\n", "  We consider the $pp \\to pp \\rho^{0} \\pi^{0}$ and $pp \\to pn \\rho^{0} \\pi^{+}$\nprocesses at LHC energies. Our description is based on the nonperturbative\nframework of tensor pomeron and tensor reggeon exchanges. We discuss the\nDrell-Hiida-Deck type mechanism with centrally produced $\\rho^{0}$ meson\nassociated with a very forward/backward $\\pi N$ system. The considered\nprocesses constitute an inelastic (non-exclusive) background to the $p p \\to p\np \\rho^0$ reaction in the case when only the centrally produced $\\rho^{0}$\nmeson decaying into $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ is measured, the final state protons are\nnot observed, and only rapidity-gap conditions are checked experimentally. We\ncompare our results for the $\\gamma \\pi^{+} \\to \\rho^{0} \\pi^{+}$ reaction with\nthe experimental data obtained by the H1 collaboration at HERA. We present\nseveral differential distributions for the $pp \\to pn \\rho^{0} \\pi^{+}$\nreaction and estimate the size of the proton dissociative background to the\nexclusive $p p \\to p p \\rho^0$ process. The ratio of integrated cross sections\nfor the inelastic $p p \\to p N \\rho^0 \\pi$ processes, where $p N \\rho^0 \\pi$\nstands for $p n \\rho^0 \\pi^{+}$ plus $p p \\rho^0 \\pi^{0}$, to the reference\nreaction $pp \\to \\ pp \\rho^0$ is of order of (7--10)\\%. We present also the\nratios of the $\\rho^0$ rapidity and transverse momentum distributions for the\ninelastic $p p \\to p N \\rho^0 \\pi$ versus the elastic $pp \\to \\ pp \\rho^0$\nreaction. Our results may be used to investigate the $\\gamma \\pi \\to \\rho^{0}\n\\pi$ process at LHC energies.\n", "  To understand the chemical composition of planets, it is important to know\nthe chemical composition of the region where they form in protoplanetary disks.\nDue to its fundamental role in chemical and biological processes, carbon is a\nkey element to trace. We aim to identify the carriers and processes behind the\nextended NIR flux observed around several Herbig stars. We compare the extended\nNIR flux from objects in the PIONIER Herbig Ae/Be survey with their flux in the\nPAH features. HD 100453 is used as a benchmark case to investigate the\ninfluence of quantum heated particles, like PAHs or very small carbonaceous\ngrains, in more detail. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCMax to\ndo a parameter study of the QHP size and scale- height and examine the\ninfluence of quantum heating on the amount of extended flux in the NIR\nvisibilities. There is a correlation between the PAH feature flux of a disk and\nthe amount of its extended NIR flux. We find that very small carbonaceous\ngrains create the observed extended NIR flux around HD 100453 and still lead to\na realistic SED. These results can not be achieved without using quantum\nheating effects, e.g. only with scattered light and grains in thermal\nequilibrium. It is possible to explain the extended NIR emission around Herbig\nstars with the presence of carbonaceous, quantum heated particles.\nInterferometric observations can be used to constrain the spatial distribution\nand typical size of carbonaceous material in the terrestrial planet forming\nregion.\n", "  We suggest and demonstrate via large scale numerical simulations an\nelectrically operated spin- wave inducer based on composite multiferroic\njunctions. Specifcally, we consider an interfacially coupled\nferromagnetic/ferroelectric structure that emits controllably spin waves in the\nferromagnets if the ferroelectric polarization is poled by an external electric\nfield. The roles of geometry and material properties are discussed.\n", "  The numerical computation of many hadronic correlation functions is\nexceedingly difficult due to the exponentially decreasing signal-to-noise ratio\nwith the distance between source and sink. Multilevel integration methods,\nusing independent updates of separate regions in space-time, are known to be\nable to solve such problems but have so far been available only for pure gauge\ntheory. We present first steps into the direction of making such integration\nschemes amenable to theories with fermions, by factorizing a given observable\nvia an approximated domain decomposition of the quark propagator. This allows\nfor multilevel integration of the (large) factorized contribution to the\nobservable, while its (small) correction can be computed in the standard way.\n", "  In the present work, we revisit two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in\ntheir fully three-dimensional (3d) form. Motivated by earlier studies of\ndark-bright solitons in the 1d case, we explore the stability of these\nstructures in their fully 3d form in two variants. In one the dark soliton is\nplanar and trapping a planar bright (disk) soliton. In the other case, a dark\nspherical shell soliton creates an effective potential in which a bright\nspherical shell of atoms is trapped in the second component. We identify these\nsolutions as numerically exact states (up to a prescribed accuracy) and perform\na Bogolyubov-de Gennes linearization analysis that illustrates that both\nstructures can be dynamically stable in suitable intervals of sufficiently low\nchemical potentials. We corroborate this finding theoretically by analyzing the\nstability via degenerate perturbation theory near the linear limit of the\nsystem. When the solitary waves are found to be unstable, we explore their\ndynamical evolution via direct numerical simulations which, in turn, reveal\nnovel waveforms that are more robust. Finally, using the SO$(2)$ symmetry of\nthe model, we produce multi-dark-bright planar or shell solitons involved in\npairwise oscillatory motion.\n", "  We show that nonlinear imaging is possible in periodic waveguide\nconfigurations provided that we use two different segments of nonlinear media\nwith opposite signs of the Kerr nonlinearity with, in general, no other\nrestriction about their magnitudes. The second medium is used to implement\neffective \"reverse propagation\". A main ingredient in achieving nonlinear\nimaging is the control of the sign and the amplitude of the coupling\ncoefficient. We numerically test our results in one and two dimensional square\narrangement of waveguides.\n", "  The light higgsino-singlino scenario of the NMSSM allows to combine a\nnaturally small $\\mu$ parameter with a good dark matter relic density. Given\nthe new constraints on spin-dependent and spin-independent direct detection\ncross sections in 2016 we study first which regions in the plane of chargino-\nand LSP-masses below 300 GeV remain viable. Subsequently we investigate the\nimpact of searches for charginos and neutralinos at the LHC, and find that the\nlimits from run I do not rule out any additional region in this plane. Only the\nHL-LHC at 3000 fb$^{-1}$ will test parts of this plane corresponding to\nhiggsino-like charginos heavier than 150 GeV and relatively light singlinos,\nbut notably the most natural regions with lighter charginos seem to remain\nunexplored.\n", "  We consider the effects of a polarization electric field on transient ion\nmotion in a thin current sheet. Using adiabatic invariants, we analytically\ndescribe a variety of ion trajectories in current sheet configurations which\ninclude a local minimum or maximum of the scalar potential in the central\nregion. Ions in the current sheet can either be trapped or ejected more\nefficiently than in an unpolarized current sheet, depending on the sign and\nmagnitude of the polarization electric field. We derive an expression for the\nrelative phase space volume filled by transient particles as a function of the\nelectric field amplitude. This expression allows us to estimate the dependence\nof transient particle and current densities on the electric field. We discuss\napplicability of these results for current sheets observed in planetary\nmagnetospheres.\n", "  We present a sample of 34 spectroscopically confirmed BzK-selected ~1e11 Msun\nquiescent galaxies (pBzK) in the COSMOS field. The targets were initially\nobserved with VIMOS on the VLT to facilitate the calibration of the photometric\nredshifts of massive galaxies at z >~ 1.5. Here we describe the reduction and\nanalysis of the data, and the spectrophotometric properties of these pBzK\ngalaxies. In particular, using a spatially resolved median 2D spectrum, we find\nthat the fraction of stellar populations with ages <1 Gyr is at least 3 times\nhigher in the outer regions of the pBzK galaxies than in their cores. This\nresults in a mild age gradient of ~<0.4 Gyr over ~6 kpc and suggests either the\noccurrence of widespread rejuvenation episodes or that inside-out quenching\nplayed a role in the passivization of this galaxy population. We also report on\nlow-level star formation rates derived from the [OII]3727A emission line, with\nSFR_OII = 3.7-4.5 Msun/yr. This estimate is confirmed by an independent\nmeasurement on a separate sample of similarly-selected quiescent galaxies in\nthe COSMOS field, using stacked far-infrared data (SFR_FIR = 2-4 Msun/yr). This\nsecond, photometric sample also displays significant excess at 1.4 GHz,\nsuggestive of the presence of radio-mode AGN activity.\n", "  As gravitational wave instrumentation becomes more sensitive, it is\ninteresting to speculate about subtle effects that could be analyzed using\nupcoming generations of detectors. One such effect that has great potential for\nrevealing the properties of very dense matter is fluid oscillations of neutron\nstars. These have been found in numerical simulations of the hypermassive\nremnants of double neutron star mergers and of highly eccentric neutron star\norbits. Here we focus on the latter and sketch out some ideas for the\nproduction, gravitational-wave detection, and analysis of neutron star\noscillations. These events will be rare (perhaps up to several tens per year\ncould be detected using third-generation detectors such as the Einstein\nTelescope or the Cosmic Explorer), but they would have unique diagnostic power\nfor the analysis of cold, catalyzed, dense matter. Furthermore, these systems\nare unusual in that analysis of the tidally excited f-modes of the stars could\nyield simultaneous measurements of their masses, moments of inertia, and tidal\nLove numbers, using the frequency, damping time, and amplitude of the modes.\nThey would thus present a nearly unique opportunity to test observationally the\nI-Love-Q relation. The analysis of such events will require significant further\nwork in nuclear physics and general relativistic nonlinear mode coupling, and\nthus we discuss further directions that will need to be pursued. For example,\nwe note that for nearly-grazing encounters, numerical simulations show that the\nenergy delivered to the f-modes may be up to two orders of magnitude greater\nthan predicted in the linear theory.\n", "  We employ the generalized parton picture to analyze the reaction $\\pi^- p\n\\rightarrow D^- \\Lambda_c^+$. Thereby it is assumed that the process amplitude\nfactorizes into one for the perturbatively calculable subprocess $\\bar{u}\\\nu\\rightarrow \\bar{c}\\ c$ and hadronic matrix elements that can be parameterized\nin terms of generalized parton distributions for the $\\pi^-\\rightarrow D^-$ and\n$p\\rightarrow \\Lambda_c^+$ transitions, respectively. Representing these parton\ndistributions in terms of valence-quark light-cone wave functions for $\\pi$,\n$D$, $p$ and $\\Lambda_c$ allows us to make numerical predictions for\nunpolarized differential and integrated cross sections as well as spin\nobservables. In the kinematical region where this approach is supposed to work,\ni.e. $s\\gtrsim 20$~GeV$^2$ and in the forward hemisphere, the resulting cross\nsections are of the order of nb. This is a finding that could be of interest in\nview of plans to measure $\\pi^- p \\rightarrow D^- \\Lambda_c^+$, e.g., at J-PARC\nor COMPASS.\n", "  We study the flow of a pure spin current through zinc oxide by measuring the\nspin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in thin film trilayer samples consisting of\nbismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG), gallium-doped zinc oxide\n(Ga:ZnO), and platinum. We investigate the dependence of the SMR magnitude on\nthe thickness of the Ga:ZnO interlayer and compare to a Bi:YIG/Pt bilayer. We\nfind that the SMR magnitude is reduced by almost one order of magnitude upon\ninserting a Ga:ZnO interlayer, and continuously decreases with increasing\ninterlayer thickness. Nevertheless, the SMR stays finite even for a\n$12\\;\\mathrm{nm}$ thick Ga:ZnO interlayer. These results show that a pure spin\ncurrent indeed can propagate through a several nm-thick degenerately doped zinc\noxide layer. We also observe differences in both the temperature and the field\ndependence of the SMR when comparing tri- and bilayers. Finally, we compare our\ndata to predictions of a model based on spin diffusion. This shows that\ninterface resistances play a crucial role for the SMR magnitude in these\ntrilayer structures.\n", "  We examine the mechanical eigenmodes of a quartz tuning fork (QTF) for the\npurpose of facilitat- ing its use as a probe for multi-frequency atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM). We perform simulations based on the three-dimensional finite\nelement method (FEM) and compare the observed motions of the beams with\nexperimentally measured resonance frequencies of two QTF systems. The com-\nparison enabled us to assign the first seven asymmetric eigenmodes of the QTF.\nWe also find that a modified version of single beam theory can be used to guide\nthe assignment of mechanical eigen- modes of QTFs. The usefulness of the QTF\nfor multi-frequency AFM measurements is demonstrated through photo-induced\nforce microscopy (PiFM) measurements. By using the QTF in different con-\nfigurations, we show that the vectorial components of the photo-induced force\ncan be independently assessed, and that lateral forces can be probed in true\nnon-contact mode.\n", "  Constraints on the number and luminosity of the sources of the cosmic\nneutrinos detected by IceCube have been set by targeted searches for point\nsources. We set complementary constraints by using the 2MASS Redshift Survey\n(2MRS) catalogue, which maps the matter distribution of the local Universe.\nAssuming that the distribution of the neutrino sources follows that of matter\nwe look for correlations between `warm' spots on the IceCube skymap and the\n2MRS matter distribution. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the expected\nnumber of neutrino multiplets and careful modelling of the detector performance\n(including that of IceCube-Gen2) we demonstrate that sources with local density\nexceeding $10^{-6} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-3}$ and neutrino luminosity $L_{\\nu}\n\\lesssim 10^{42} \\, \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$ ($10^{41} \\, \\text{erg} \\,\n\\text{s}^{-1}$) will be efficiently revealed by our method using IceCube\n(IceCube-Gen2). At low luminosities such as will be probed by IceCube-Gen2, the\nsensitivity of this analysis is superior to requiring statistically significant\ndirect observation of a point source.\n", "  In this paper, we present a 3-D one step photoemission model that can be used\nto calculate the quantum efficiency and momentum distributions of electrons\nphotoemitted from ordered single crystal surfaces close to the photoemission\nthreshold. Using Ag(111) as an example, we show that the model can not only\ncalculate the quantum efficiency from the surface state accurately without\nusing any ad hoc parameters, but also provides a theoretical quantitative\nexplanation of the vectorial photoelectric effect. This model in conjunction\nwith other band structure and wave function calculation techniques can be\neffectively used to screen single crystal photoemitters for use as electron\nsources for particle accelerator and ultrafast electron diffraction\napplications.\n", "  We exploit the separation of scales in weakly-bound nuclei to compute E2\ntransitions and electric form factors in a Halo EFT framework. The relevant\ndegrees of freedom are the core and the halo neutron. The EFT expansion is\ncarried out in powers of $R_{core}/R_{halo}$, where $R_{core}$ and $R_{halo}$\ndenote the length scales of the core and halo, respectively. We include the\nstrong $s$-wave and $d$-wave interactions by introducing dimer fields. The\ndimer propagators are regulated by employing the power divergence subtraction\nscheme and matched to the effective range expansion in the respective\nchannel.Electromagnetic interactions are included via minimal substitution in\nthe Lagrangian. We demonstrate that, depending on the observable and respective\npartial wave, additional local gauge-invariant operators contribute in LO, NLO\nand higher orders.\n", "  Recent studies have evidenced that long-baseline (LBL) experiments are\nsensitive to the extra CP-phases involved with light sterile neutrinos, whose\nexistence is suggested by several anomalous short-baseline (SBL) results. We\nshow that, within the 3+1 scheme, the combination of the existing SBL data with\nthe LBL results coming from the two currently running experiments NO$\\nu$A and\nT2K, enables us to simultaneously constrain two active-sterile mixing angles\n$\\theta_{14}$ and $\\theta_{24}$ and two CP-phases $\\delta_{13} \\equiv \\delta$\nand $\\delta_{14}$, albeit the information on the second CP-phase is still weak\nat the moment. The two mixing angles are basically determined by the SBL data,\nwhile the two CP-phases are constrained by the LBL experiments, once the\ninformation coming from the SBL setups is taken into account. We also assess\nthe robustness/fragility of the estimates of the standard 3-flavor parameters\nin the more general 3+1 scheme. To this regard we find that: i) the indication\nof CP-violation found in the 3-flavor analyses persists also in the 3+1 scheme,\nwith $\\delta_{13} \\equiv \\delta$ having still its best fit value around\n$-\\pi/2$; ii) the 3-flavor weak hint in favor of the normal hierarchy becomes\neven less significant when sterile neutrinos come into play; iii) the weak\nindication of non-maximal $\\theta_{23}$ (driven by NO$\\nu$A disappearance data)\npersists in the 3+1 scheme, where maximal mixing is disfavored at almost the\n90\\% C.L. in both normal and inverted mass hierarchy; iv) the preference in\nfavor of one of the two octants of $\\theta_{23}$ found in the 3-flavor\nframework (higher octant for inverted mass hierarchy) is completely washed out\nin the 3+1 scheme.\n", "  Atomtronics is an emerging field in quantum technology that promises to\nrealize 'atomic circuit' architectures exploiting ultra-cold atoms manipulated\nin versatile micro-optical circuits generated by laser fields of different\nshapes and intensities or micro-magnetic circuits known as atom chips. Although\ndevising new applications for computation and information transfer is a\ndefining goal of the field, Atomtronics wants to enlarge the scope of quantum\nsimulators and to access new physical regimes with novel fundamental science.\nWith this focus issue we want to survey the state of the art of\nAtomtronics-enabled Quantum Technology. We collect articles on both conceptual\nand applicative aspects of the field for diverse exploitations, both to extend\nthe scope of the existing atom-based quantum devices and to devise platforms\nfor new routes to quantum technology.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated that, in the event of a putative signal in\ndark matter direct detection experiments, properly identifying the underlying\ndark matter-nuclei interaction promises to be a challenging task. Given the\nmost optimistic expectations for the number counts of recoil events in the\nforthcoming Generation 2 experiments, differentiating between interactions that\nproduce distinct features in the recoil energy spectra will only be possible if\na strong signal is observed simultaneously on a variety of complementary\ntargets. However, there is a wide range of viable theories that give rise to\nvirtually identical energy spectra, and may only differ by the dependence of\nthe recoil rate on the dark matter velocity. In this work, we investigate how\ndegeneracy between such competing models may be broken by analyzing the time\ndependence of nuclear recoils, i.e. the annual modulation of the rate. For this\npurpose, we simulate dark matter events for a variety of interactions and\nexperiments, and perform a Bayesian model-selection analysis on all simulated\ndata sets, evaluating the chance of correctly identifying the input model for a\ngiven experimental setup. We find that including information on the annual\nmodulation of the rate may significantly enhance the ability of a single target\nto distinguish dark matter models with nearly degenerate recoil spectra, but\nonly with exposures beyond the expectations of Generation 2 experiments.\n", "  A stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations due to a super-position of\nuncorrelated Lorentzian pulses is presented. For constant pulse duration, this\nis shown to result in an exponential power spectral density for the stationary\nprocess. A random distribution of pulse durations modifies the frequency\nspectrum and several examples are shown to result in power law spectra. The\ndistribution of pulse durations does not influence the characteristic function\nand thus neither the moments nor the probability density function for the\nrandom variable. It is demonstrated that the fluctuations are intrinsically\nintermittent through a large excess kurtosis moment in the limit of weak pulse\noverlap. These results allow to estimate the basic properties of fluctuations\nfrom measurement data and describe the diversity of frequency spectra reported\nfrom measurements in magnetized plasmas.\n", "  The performance of a detector using liquid xenon (LXe) as a scintillator is\nstrongly dependent on the collection efficiency for xenon scintillation light,\nwhich in turn is critically dependent on the reflectance of the surfaces that\nsurround the active volume. To improve the light collection in such detectors\nthe active volume is usually surrounded by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)\nreflector panels, used due to its very high reflectance -- even at the short\nwavelength of scintillation light of LXe (peaked at $178\\,\\text{nm}$). In this\nwork, which contributed to the overall R\\&D effort towards the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ)\nexperiment, we present experimental results for the absolute reflectance of\nthree different PTFE samples (including the material used in the LUX detector)\nimmersed in LXe for its scintillation light. The obtained results show that\nvery high bi-hemispherical reflectance values ($\\geq97$%) can be achieved,\nenabling very low energy thresholds in liquid xenon scintillator-based\ndetectors.\n", "  In this work we present a determination of the mass, width and coupling of\nthe resonances that appear in kaon-pion scattering below 1.8 GeV. These are:\nthe much debated scalar $\\kappa$-meson, nowdays known as $K_0^*(800)$, the\nscalar $K_0^*(1430)$, the $K^*(892)$ and $K_1^*(1410)$ vectors, the spin-two\n$K_2^*(1430)$ as well as the spin-three $K^*_3(1780)$. The parameters will be\ndetermined from the pole associated to each resonance by means of an analytic\ncontinuation of the $K\\pi$ scattering amplitudes obtained in a recent and\nprecise data analysis constrained with dispersion relations, which were not\nwell satisfied in previous analyses. This analytic continuation will be\nperformed by means of Pad\\'e approximants, thus avoiding a particular model for\nthe pole parameterization. We also pay particular attention to the evaluation\nof uncertainties.\n", "  We employ chiral perturbation theory to calculate the nucleon-pion-state\ncontribution to the 3-point correlation functions measured in lattice QCD to\ncompute various moments of parton distribution functions (quark momentum\nfraction, helicity and transversity moment). We estimate the impact of the\nnucleon-pion-state contribution on the plateau method for lattice simulations\nwith a physical pion mass. The nucleon-pion-state contribution results in an\noverestimation of all three moments. The overestimation is at the 5-20% level\nfor source-sink separations of about 1.5 fm.\n", "  100 years after Smoluchowski introduces his approach to stochastic processes,\nthey are now at the basis of mathematical and physical modeling in cellular\nbiology: they are used for example to analyse and to extract features from\nlarge number (tens of thousands) of single molecular trajectories or to study\nthe diffusive motion of molecules, proteins or receptors. Stochastic modeling\nis a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology\nconcepts. We review here the Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes\nand provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying\npolymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss\nthe stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic\ngene regulation.\n", "  Nickel monosilicide (NiSi) has emerged as an excellent material of choice for\nsource-drain contact applications below 45 nm node complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. We have investigated the formation\nof nanoscale NiSi by ion irradiation of Si (~5 nm)/Ni(~15 nm)/Si, grown under\nultrahigh vacuum environment. Irradiation was carried out at room temperature\nwith 1 MeV Si+ ions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron\nmicroscopy (TEM) were employed for analysis. With increasing ion fluence ion\nbeam mixing occurs and more and more Si is incorporated into the Ni layer and\nthis layer gets amorphized. At an even higher fluence a recrystallized uniform\nnickel monosilicide ({\\eta}-NiSi) layer is formed. Several planar spacings of\ndifferent Miller indices of {\\eta}-NiSi have been observed in XRD and TEM.\nAdditionally, an oscillatory amorphization and recrystallization has been\nobserved in the substrate Si with increasing ion fluence. To our knowledge,\nthis has never been observed in ion irradiation of bare Si in decades of work\nin this area. The oscillatory amorphization/recrystallization in Si is\napparently Ni-induced. Irradiation displaces Ni and produces a distribution of\nNi in amorphized Si. Irradiation at a higher fluence produces two\nrecrystallized Si bands in amorphous Si with concomitant accumulation of Ni at\nthe amorphous/crystalline interfaces. On further increase of irradiation\nfluence the recrystallized Si bands again pass through amorphization and\nrecrystallization. The total thickness of recrystallized as well as amorphous\nSi shows an oscillatory behavior as a function of ion fluence.\n", "  A D-dimensional gravitational model with a Gauss-Bonnet term and the\ncosmological term Lambda is considered. By assuming diagonal cosmological\nmetrics, we find, for certain fine-tuned Lambda, a class of solutions with\nexponential time dependence of two scale factors, governed by two Hubble-like\nparameters H >0 and h < 0, corresponding to factor spaces of dimensions m > 3\nand l > 1, respectively, with (m,l) non-equal to (6,6), (7,4), (9,3) and D = 1\n+ m + l. Any of these solutions describes an exponential expansion of\n3-dimensional subspace with Hubble parameter H and zero variation of the\neffective gravitational constant G. We prove the stability of these solutions\nin a class of cosmological solutions with diagonal metrics.\n", "  Variability in the X-rays is a key ingredient in understanding and unveiling\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) properties. In this band flux variations occur on\nshort time scales (hours) as well as on larger times scales. While short time\nscale variability is often investigated in single source studies, only few\nworks are able to explore flux variation on very long time scales.This work\nprovides a statistical analysis of the AGN long term X-ray variability. We\nstudy variability on the largest time interval ever investigated for the 0.2-2\nkeV band, up to $\\sim 20$ years rest-frame for a sample of 220 sources.\nMoreover, we study variability for 2,700 quasars up to $\\sim 8$ years\nrest-frame in the same (soft) band.We build our source sample using the 3XMM\nserendipitous source catalogue data release 5, and data from ROSAT All Sky\nSurvey Bright and Faint source catalogues. In order to select only AGN we use\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogues data releases 7 and 12.\nCombining ROSAT and XMM-Newton observations, we investigate variability using\nthe structure function analysis which describes the amount of variability as a\nfunction of the lag between the observations.Our work shows an increase of the\nstructure function up to 20 years. We do not find evidence of a plateau in the\nstructure function on these long time scales.The increase of the structure\nfunction at long time lags suggests that variability in the soft X-rays can be\ninfluenced by flux variations originated in the accretion disk or that they\ntake place in a region large enough to justify variation on such long time\nscales.\n", "  We demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the axial coordinate of a gamma\nquantum interaction point in a plastic scintillator bar via the detection of\nscintillation photons escaping from the scintillator with an array of\nwavelength-shifting (WLS) strips. Using a test set-up comprising a BC-420\nscintillator bar and an~array of sixteen BC-482A WLS strips we achieved a\nspatial resolution of~5\\,mm~($\\sigma$) for annihilation photons from a\n$^{22}$Na isotope. The studied method can be used to improve the spatial\nresolution of a plastic-scintillator-based PET scanner which is being developed\nby the J-PET collaboration.\n", "  We present expressions for the supercurrents generated by a generic\n$4D,~\\mathcal{N}=1$ theory of complex linear superfield $\\Sigma$. We verify\nthat these expressions satisfy the appropriate superspace conservation\nequations. Furthermore, we discuss the component projection in order to derive\nexpressions for the energy-momentum tensor, the supersymmetry current and the\nR-symmetry current when available. In addition, we discuss aspects of the\ncoupling of the theory to supergravity. Specifically, we present a\nstraightforward method to select the appropriate formulations of supergravity\nthat one must use in order to do the coupling. This procedure is controlled by\na superfield X originating from the Super-Poincar\\'{e} invariance of the\ntheory. We apply these results to examples of theories with higher derivative\nterms.\n", "  It is important to find nontrivial constraint relations for color-ordered\namplitudes in gauge theories. In the past several years, a pure group-theoretic\niterative method has been proposed to derive linear constraints on\ncolor-ordered amplitudes in SU(N) gauge theories. In this paper, we use the\nsame method to derive linear constraints on four-point gluon amplitudes in\nSO(N) and Sp(2N) gauge theories. These constraints are derived up to four-loop\norder. It is found that there are $n=1,6,10,13,16$ constraint relations at\n$L=0,1,2,3,4$ loop orders in both SO(N) and Sp(2N) cases. Correspondingly, the\nnumbers of independent four-point color-ordered amplitudes are $2,3, 5, 8, 11$\nat $L=0,1,2,3,4$ loop orders in both theories.\n", "  Static granular packings are model hard-sphere glass formers. The nature of\nglass transition has remained a hotly debated issue. We review recent\nexperimental progresses in using granular materials to study glass transitions.\nWe focus on the growth of glass order with five-fold symmetry in granular\npackings and relate the findings to both geometric frustration and random\nfirst-order phase transition theories.\n", "  Context. In time-distance helioseismology, wave travel times are measured\nfrom the two-point cross-covariance function of solar oscillations and are used\nto image the solar convection zone in three dimensions. There is, however, also\ninformation in the amplitude of the cross-covariance function, for example\nabout seismic wave attenuation. Aims. Here we develop a convenient procedure to\nmeasure the amplitude of the cross-covariance function of solar oscillations.\nMethods. In this procedure, the amplitude of the cross-covariance function is\nlinearly related to the cross-covariance function and can be measured even for\nhigh levels of noise. Results. As an example application, we measure the\namplitude perturbations of the seismic waves that propagate through the sunspot\nin active region NOAA 9787. We can recover the amplitude variations due to the\nscattering and attenuation of the waves by the sunspot and associated\nfinite-wavelength effects. Conclusions. The proposed definition of\ncross-covariance amplitude is robust to noise, can be used to relate measured\namplitudes to 3D perturbations in the solar interior under the Born\napproximation, and will provide independent information from the travel times.\n", "  We study stability of singularity-free cosmological solutions with positive\ncosmological constant based on projectable Ho\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory. In\nHL theory, the isotropic and homogeneous cosmological solutions with bounce can\nbe realized if spacial curvature is non-zero. By performing perturbation\nanalysis around non-flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime,\nwe derive a quadratic action and discuss the stability, i.e, ghost and\ntachyon-free conditions. Although the squared effective mass of scalar\nperturbation must be negative in infrared regime, we can avoid tachyon\ninstability by considering strong Hubble friction. Additionally, we estimate\nthe backreaction from the perturbations on background geometry, especially,\nagainst anisotropic perturbation in closed FLRW spacetime. It turns out that\ncertain types of bouncing solution may be spoiled even if all perturbation\nmodes are stable.\n"]}
