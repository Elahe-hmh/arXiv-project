researched\nanalytically from the point of view of the order parameters concept. The\nreaction-diffusion system in external noise is considered as a model of such\nmedium. Stochastic equations for the unstable mode amplitudes (order\nparameters), dispersion equations for the unstable mode averaged amplitudes,\nand the Fokker-Planck equation for the order parameters have been obtained. The\ndeveloped theory makes it possible to analyze different noise-induced effects,\nincluding the variation of boundaries of ordering and disordering phase\ntransitions depending on the parameters of external noise\n", "  This paper proposes stochastic models for the analysis of ocean surface\ntrajectories obtained from freely-drifting satellite-tracked instruments. The\nproposed time series models are used to summarise large multivariate datasets\nand infer important physical parameters of inertial oscillations and other\nocean processes. Nonstationary time series methods are employed to account for\nthe spatiotemporal variability of each trajectory. Because the datasets are\nlarge, we construct computationally efficient methods through the use of\nfrequency-domain modelling and estimation, with the data expressed as\ncomplex-valued time series. We detail how practical issues related to sampling\nand model misspecification may be addressed using semi-parametric techniques\nfor time series, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our stochastic models\nthrough application to both real-world data and to numerical model output.\n", "  We show, through local estimates and simulation, that if one constrains\nsimple graphs by their densities $\\varepsilon$ of edges and $\\tau$ of\ntriangles, then asymptotically (in the number of vertices) for over $95\\%$ of\nthe possible range of those densities there is a well-defined typical graph,\nand it has a very simple structure: the vertices are decomposed into two\nsubsets $V_1$ and $V_2$ of fixed relative size $c$ and $1-c$, and there are\nwell-defined probabilities of edges, $g_{jk}$, between $v_j\\in V_j$, and\n$v_k\\in V_k$. Furthermore the four parameters $c, g_{11}, g_{22}$ and $g_{12}$\nare smooth functions of $(\\varepsilon,\\tau)$ except at two smooth `phase\ntransition' curves.\n", "  We study the asymptotics of large, simple, labeled graphs constrained by the\ndensities of edges and of $k$-star subgraphs, $k\\ge 2$ fixed. We prove that\nunder such constraints graphs are \"multipodal\": asymptotically in the number of\nvertices there is a partition of the vertices into $M < \\infty$ subsets $V_1,\nV_2, \\ldots, V_M$, and a set of well-defined probabilities $g_{ij}$ of an edge\nbetween any $v_i \\in V_i$ and $v_j \\in V_j$. For $2\\le k\\le 30$ we determine\nthe phase space: the combinations of edge and $k$-star densities achievable\nasymptotically. For these models there are special points on the boundary of\nthe phase space with nonunique asymptotic (graphon) structure; for the 2-star\nmodel we prove that the nonuniqueness extends to entropy maximizers in the\ninterior of the phase space.\n", "  We develop a mean-field approach for multicomponent stochastic spatially\nextended systems and use it to obtain a multivariate nonlinear self-consistent\nFokker-Planck equation defining the probability density of the state of the\nsystem, which describes a well-known model of autocatalytic chemical reaction\n(brusselator) with spatially correlated multiplicative noise, and to study the\nevolution of probability density and statistical characteristics of the system\nin the process of spatial pattern formation. We propose the finite-difference\nmethod for numerical solving of a general class of multivariate nonlinear\nself-consistent time-dependent Fokker-Planck equations. We illustrate the\naccuracy and reliability of the method. Numerical study of the nonlinear\nself-consistent Fokker-Planck equation solutions for a stochastic brusselator\nshows that in the region of Turing bifurcation several types of solutions exist\nif noise intensity increases: unimodal solution, transient bimodality, and an\ninteresting solution which involves multiple repumping of probability density\nthrough bimodality. Additionally we study the behavior of the order parameter\nof the system under consideration and show that the second type of solution\narises in the supercritical region if noise intensity values are close to the\nvalues appropriate for the transition from bimodal stationary probability\ndensity for the order parameter to the unimodal one.\n", "  Applications of the H\\\"uckel (tight binding) model are ubiquitous in quantum\nchemistry and solid state physics. The matrix representation of this model is\nisomorphic to an unoriented vertex adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph, which\nis also the Laplacian matrix plus twice the identity. In this paper, we\nanalytically calculate the determinant and, when it exists, the inverse of this\nmatrix in connection with the Green's function, $\\mathbf{G}$, of the $N\\times\nN$ H\\\"uckel matrix. A corollary is a closed form expression for a Harmonic sum\n(Eq. 12). We then extend the results to $d-$dimensional lattices, whose linear\nsize is $N$. The existence of the inverse becomes a question of number theory.\nWe prove a new theorem in number theory pertaining to vanishing sums of cosines\nand use it to prove that the inverse exists if and only if $N+1$ and $d$ are\nodd and $d$ is smaller than the smallest divisor of $N+1$. We corroborate our\nresults by demonstrating the entry patterns of the Green's function and discuss\napplications related to transport and conductivity.\n", "  With the measurement of positron flux published recently by AMS-02\ncollaboration, we show how the leptophilic dark matter fits the observation. We\nobtain the percentages of different products of dark matter annihilation that\ncan best describe the flux of high energy positrons observed by AMS. We show\nthat dark matter annihilates predominantly into $\\tau\\tau$ pair, while both\n$ee$ and $\\mu\\mu$ final states should be less than $20\\%$. When gauge boson\nfinal states are included, the best branching ratio of needed $\\tau\\tau$ mode\nreduces.\n", "  An operator-valued quantum phase space formula is constructed. The phase\nspace formula of Quantum Mechanics provides a natural link between first and\nsecond quantization, thus contributing to the understanding of quantization\nproblem. By the combination of quantization and hamiltonization of dynamics, a\nquantization hierarchy is introduced, beyond the framework of first and second\nquantization and generalizing the standard quantum theory. We apply our\nquantization method to quantum many-body system and propose an eclectic model,\nin which the dimension of Hilbert space does not scale exponentially with the\nnumber of particles due to the locality of interaction, and the evolution is a\nconstrained Hamiltonian dynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we will first derive the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the\ngeneralized geometry which occurs in M-theory. Then we will observe that\nM2-branes act as probes for this generalized geometry, and as M2-branes have an\nextended structure, their extended structure will limits the resolution to\nwhich this generalized geometry can be defined. We will demonstrate that this\nwill deform the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the generalized geometry. We\nanalyze such a deformed Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace\napproximation and observe that this deformation can be used as a solution to\nthe problem of time. This is because this deformation gives rise to time\ncrystals in our universe due to the spontaneous breaking of time\nre-parametrization invariance.\n", "  We show that the process matrix in the basis of tensor products of Pauli\noperators or SU(N) generators representing low rank and sparse dynamical maps\nwill have only a few distinct entries which goes as $O(r^2)$ ($r$ is the rank).\n", "  We present a relatively simple time domain method for determining the\nbandpass response of a system by injecting a nanosecond pulse and capturing the\nsystem voltage output. A pulse of sub-nanosecond duration contains all\nfrequency components with nearly constant amplitude up to 1 GHz. Hence, this\nmethod can accurately determine the system bandpass response to a broadband\nsignal. In a novel variation on this impulse response method, a train of pulses\nis coherently accumulated providing precision calibration with a simple system.\nThe basic concept is demonstrated using a pulse generator-accumulator setup\nrealised in a Bedlam board which is a high speed digital signal processing\nunit. The same system was used at the Parkes radio telescope between 2-13\nOctober 2013 and we demonstrate its powerful diagnostic capability. We also\npresent some initial test data from this experiment.\n", "  The electromagnetic scattering properties of topological insulator (TI)\nspheres are systematically studied in this paper. Unconventional backward\nscattering caused by the topological magneto-electric (TME) effect of TIs are\nfound in both Rayleigh and Mie scattering regimes. This enhanced backward\nscattering can be achieved by introducing an impedance-matched background which\ncan suppress the bulk scattering. For the cross-polarized scattering\ncoefficients, interesting antiresonances are found in the Mie scattering\nregime, wherein the cross-polarized electromagnetic fields induced by the TME\neffect are trapped inside TI spheres. In the Rayleigh limit, the quantized TME\neffect of TIs can be determined by measuring the electric-field components of\nscattered waves in the far field.\n", "  We present a numerical study of a reaction-diffusion model on a small-world\nnetwork. We characterize the model's average activity $F_T$ after $T$ time\nsteps and the transition from a collective (global) extinct state to an active\nstate in parameter space. We provide an explicit relation between the\nparameters of our model at the frontier between these states. A collective\nactive state can be associated to a global epidemic spread, or to a persistent\nneuronal activity. We found that $F_T$ does not depends on disorder in the\nnetwork if the transmission rate $r$ or the average coordination number $K$ are\nlarge enough. The collective extinct-active transition can be induced by\nchanging two parameters associated to the network: $K$ and the disorder\nparameter $p$ (which controls the variance of $K$). We can also induce the\ntransition by changing $r$, which controls the threshold size in the dynamics.\nIn order to operate at the transition the parameters of the model must satisfy\nthe relation $rK=a_p$, where $a_p$ as a function of $p/(1-p)$ is a stretched\nexponential function. Our results are relevant for systems that operate {\\it\nat} the transition in order to increase its dynamic range and/or to operate\nunder optimal information-processing conditions. We discuss how glassy\nbehaviour appears within our model.\n", "  We have studied collective modes of quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensates with\nmultiply-charged vortices using a variational approach. Two of the four\ncollective modes considered exhibit coupling between the vortex dynamics and\nthe large-scale motion of the cloud. The vortex presence causes a shift in all\nfrequencies of collective modes even for the ones that do not couple\ndynamically with the vortex-core. The coupling between vortex and large-scale\ncollective excitations can induce the multi-charged vortex to decay into\nsingly-charged vortices with the quadrupole mode being one possible channel for\nsuch a decay. Therefore a thorough study was done about the possibility to\nprevent the vortex decay by applying a Gaussian potential with its width\nproportional to the vortex-core radius and varying its height. In such way, we\ncreated a stability diagram of height versus interaction strength which has\nstable regions due the static Gaussian potential. Furthermore, by using a\nsinusoidal time-modulation around the average height of the Gaussian potential,\nwe have obtained a diagram for the parametric resonance which can prevent the\nvortex decay in regions where static potential can not.\n", "  In the present paper, the Tsallis statistics in the grand canonical ensemble\nwas reconsidered in a general form. The thermodynamic properties of the\nnonrelativistic ideal gas of hadrons in the grand canonical ensemble was\nstudied numerically and analytically in a finite volume and the thermodynamic\nlimit. It was proved that the Tsallis statistics in the grand canonical\nensemble satisfies the requirements of the equilibrium thermodynamics in the\nthermodynamic limit if the thermodynamic potential is a homogeneous function of\nthe first order with respect to the extensive variables of state of the system\nand the entropic variable $z=1/(q-1)$ is an extensive variable of state. The\nequivalence of canonical, microcanonical and grand canonical ensembles for the\nnonrelativistic ideal gas of hadrons was demonstrated.\n", "  During voiced speech, the human vocal folds interact with the vocal tract\nacoustics. The resulting glottal source-resonator coupling has been observed\nusing mathematical and physical models as well as in in vivo phonation. We\npropose a computational time-domain model of the full speech apparatus that, in\nparticular, contains a feedback mechanism from the vocal tract acoustics to the\nvocal fold oscillations. It is based on numerical solution of ordinary and\npartial differential equations defined on vocal tract geometries that have been\nobtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The model is used to simulate rising\nand falling pitch glides of [a, i] in the fundamental frequency (f_o) interval\n[150 Hz, 320 Hz]. The interval contains the first vocal tract resonance f_R1\nand the first formant F1 of [i] as well as the fractions of the first resonance\nf_R1/4 and fR1/3 of [a].\n  The simulations reveal a locking pattern of the fo-trajectory at f_R1 of [i]\nin falling and rising glides. The resonance fractions of [a] produce\nperturbations in the pressure signal at the lips but no locking. All these\nobservations from the model behaviour are consistent and robust within a wide\nrange of feasible model parameter values and under exclusion of secondary model\ncomponents.\n", "  It has recently been demonstrated that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can\ninteract with superconducting qubits at the quantum level. SAW resonators in\nthe GHz frequency range have also been found to have low loss at temperatures\ncompatible with superconducting quantum circuits. These advances open up new\npossibilities to use the phonon degree of freedom to carry quantum information.\nIn this paper, we give a description of the basic SAW components needed to\ndevelop quantum circuits, where propagating or localized SAW-phonons are used\nboth to study basic physics and to manipulate quantum information. Using\nphonons instead of photons offers new possibilities which make these quantum\nacoustic circuits very interesting. We discuss general considerations for SAW\nexperiments at the quantum level and describe experiments both with SAW\nresonators and with interaction between SAWs and a qubit. We also discuss\nseveral potential future developments.\n", "  A model-independent statistical framework is presented to interpret data from\nsystems where the mean time derivative of positional cross correlation between\nworld lines, a measure of spreading in a quantum geometrical wave function, is\nmeasured with a precision smaller than the Planck time. The framework provides\na general way to constrain possible departures from perfect independence of\nclassical world lines, associated with Planck scale bounds on positional\ninformation. A parametrized candidate set of possible correlation functions is\nshown to be consistent with the known causal structure of the classical\ngeometry measured by an apparatus, and the holographic scaling of information\nsuggested by gravity. Frequency-domain power spectra are derived that can be\ncompared with interferometer data. Simple projections of sensitivity for\nspecific experimental set-ups suggests that measurements will directly yield\nconstraints on a universal time derivative of the correlation function, and\nthereby confirm or rule out a class of Planck scale departures from classical\ngeometry.\n", "  Recently, several white dwarfs have been proposed with masses significantly\nabove the Chandrasekhar limit, known as Super-Chandrasekhar White Dwarfs, to\naccount for the overluminous Type Ia supernovae. In the present work, Equation\nof State of a completely degenerate relativistic electron gas in magnetic field\nbased on Landau quantization of charged particles in a magnetic field is\ndeveloped. The mass-radius relations for magnetized White Dwarfs are obtained\nby solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The effects of the\nmagnetic energy density and pressure contributed by a density-dependent\nmagnetic field are treated properly to find the stability configurations of\nrealistic magnetic White Dwarf stars.\n", "  The phenomenon of stochastic eternal inflation is studied for a chaotic\ninflation potential in a Bianchi Type I spacetime background. After deriving\nthe appropriate stochastic Klein-Gordon equation, we give details on the\nconditions for eternal inflation. It is shown that for eternal inflation to\noccur, the amount of anisotropy must be small. In fact, it is shown that\neternal inflation will only take place if the shear anisotropy variables take\non values within a small region of the interior of the Kasner circle. We then\ncalculate the probability of eternal inflation occurring based on techniques\nfrom stochastic calculus.\n", "  In this work we study some properties of the three dimensional $U(N)$ SUSY\nChern-Simons coupled to a scalar field in the fundamental representation in the\nlarge $N$ limit. For large $N$ we show that the theory has two phases, one\nwhich is conformally invariant, and other where the superconformal symmetry is\nbroken and masses for the matter fields are generated.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the effect of disorder on the topological\nproperties of multichannel superconductor nanowires. While the standard\nexpectation is that the spectral gap is closed and opened at transitions that\nchange the topological index of the wire, we show that the closing and opening\nof a transport gap can also cause topological transitions, even in the presence\nof nonzero density of states across the transition. Such transport gaps induced\nby disorder can change the topological index, driving a topologically trivial\nwire into a nontrivial state or vice versa. We focus on the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupled semiconductor nanowires in proximity to a conventional superconductor,\nwhich is an experimentally relevant system, and obtain analytical formulas for\ntopological transitions in these wires, valid for generic realizations of\ndisorder. Full tight-binding simulations show excellent agreement with our\nanalytical results without any fitting parameters.\n", "  Gauge theory approach to consideration of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons as gauge\nand vector fields represented by the Cartan forms of spontaneously broken\nsymmetries, is discussed. The approach is generalized to describe the\nfundamental branes in terms of $(p+1)$-dimensional worldvolume gauge and\nmassless tensor fields consisting of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with\nthe spontaneously broken Poincare symmetry of the $D$-dimensional Minkowski\nspace.\n", "  We study the asymptotics of large simple graphs constrained by the limiting\ndensity of edges and the limiting subgraph density of an arbitrary fixed graph\n$H$. We prove that, for all but finitely many values of the edge density, if\nthe density of $H$ is constrained to be slightly higher than that for the\ncorresponding Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph, the typical large graph is bipodal with\nparameters varying analytically with the densities. Asymptotically, the\nparameters depend only on the degree sequence of $H$.\n", "  Several recent results are reported from work aiming to improve the\nquantitative precision of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics for relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. The dense matter created in such collisions expands in a\nhighly anisotropic manner. Due to viscous effects this also renders the local\nmomentum distribution anisotropic. Optimized hydrodynamic approaches account\nfor these anisotropies already at leading order in a gradient expansion.\nRecently discovered exact solutions of the relativistic Boltzmann equation in\nanisotropically expanding systems provide a powerful testbed for such improved\nhydrodynamic approximations. We present the latest status of our quest for a\nformulation of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics that is optimized for\napplications to relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We present systematic measurements of the quality factors of surface acoustic\nwave (SAW) resonators on ST-X quartz in the gigahertz range at a temperature of\n$10 \\, \\textrm{mK}$. We demonstrate a internal quality factor $Q_\\mathrm{i}$\napproaching $0.5$ million at $0.5 \\, \\textrm{GHz}$ and show that\n$Q_\\mathrm{i}\\geq4.0\\times10^4$ is achievable up to $4.4 \\, \\textrm{GHz}$. We\nshow evidence for a polynomial dependence of propagation loss on frequency, as\nwell as a weak drive power dependence of $Q_\\mathrm{i}$ that saturates at low\npower, the latter being consistent with coupling to a bath of two-level\nsystems. Our results indicate that SAW resonators are promising devices for\nintegration with superconducting quantum circuits.\n", "  The existence of incompatible measurements, epitomized by Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle, is one of the distinctive features of quantum theory. So\nfar, quantum incompatibility has been studied for measurements that test the\npreparation of physical systems. Here we extend the notion to measurements that\ntest dynamical processes, possibly consisting of multiple time steps. Such\nmeasurements are known as testers and are implemented by interacting with the\ntested process through a sequence of state preparations, interactions, and\nmeasurements. Our first result is a characterization of the incompatibility of\nquantum testers, for which we provide necessary and sufficient conditions.\nThen, we propose a quantitative measure of incompatibility. We call this\nmeasure the robustness of incompatibility and define it as the minimum amount\nof noise that has to be added to a set of testers in order to make them\ncompatible. We show that (i) the robustness is lower bounded by the\ndistinguishability of the sequence of interactions used by the tester and (ii)\nmaximum robustness is attained when the interactions are perfectly\ndistinguishable. The general results are illustrated in the concrete example of\nbinary testers probing the time-evolution of a single-photon polarization.\n", "  The target and double spin asymmetries of the exclusive pseudoscalar channel\n$\\vec e\\vec p\\to ep\\pi^0$ were measured for the first time in the\ndeep-inelastic regime using a longitudinally polarized 5.9 GeV electron beam\nand a longitudinally polarized proton target at Jefferson Lab with the CEBAF\nLarge Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). The data were collected over a large\nkinematic phase space and divided into 110 four-dimensional bins of $Q^2$,\n$x_B$, $-t$ and $\\phi$. Large values of asymmetry moments clearly indicate a\nsubstantial contribution to the polarized structure functions from transverse\nvirtual photon amplitudes. The interpretation of experimental data in terms of\ngeneralized parton distributions (GPDs) provides the first insight on the\nchiral-odd GPDs $\\tilde{H}_T$ and $E_T$, and complement previous measurements\nof unpolarized structure functions sensitive to the GPDs $H_T$ and $\\bar E_T$.\nThese data provide necessary constraints for chiral-odd GPD parametrizations\nand will strongly influence existing theoretical handbag models.\n", "  The contextuality of quantum mechanics, i.e. the measurement outcome\ndependence upon previously made measurements, can be shown by the violation of\ninequalities based on measurements of well chosen observables. An important\nproperty of such observables is that their expectation value can be expressed\nin terms of probabilities of obtaining two exclusive outcomes. In order to\nsatisfy this, inequalities have been constructed using either observables with\na dichotomic spectrum or using periodic functions obtained from displacement\noperators in phase space. Here we identify the general conditions on the\nspectral decomposition of observables demonstrating state independent\ncontextuality of quantum mechanics. As a consequence, our results not only\nunify existing strategies for maximal violation of state independent\nnon-contextual inequalities but also lead to new scenarii enabling such\nviolation. Among the consequences of our results is the impossibility of having\na state independent maximal violation of non-contextuality in the Peres-Mermin\nscenario with discrete observables of odd dimensions.\n", "  We used femtosecond optical pump-probe spectroscopy to study the photoinduced\nchange in reflectivity of thin films of the electron-doped cuprate\nLa$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (LCCO) with dopings of x$=$0.08 (underdoped) and\nx$=$0.11 (optimally doped). Above T$_c$, we observe fluence-dependent\nrelaxation rates which onset at a similar temperature that transport\nmeasurements first see signatures of antiferromagnetic correlations. Upon\nsuppressing superconductivity with a magnetic field, it is found that the\nfluence and temperature dependence of relaxation rates is consistent with\nbimolecular recombination of electrons and holes across a gap (2$\\Delta_{AF}$)\noriginating from antiferromagnetic correlations which comprise the pseudogap in\nelectron-doped cuprates. This can be used to learn about coupling between\nelectrons and high-energy ($\\omega>2\\Delta_{AF}$) excitations in these\ncompounds and set limits on the timescales on which antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations are static.\n", "  We report and provide fitting functions for the abundance of dark matter\nhalos and subhalos as a function of mass, circular velocity, and redshift from\nthe new Bolshoi-Planck and MultiDark-Planck $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nsimulations, based on the Planck cosmological parameters. We also report the\nhalo mass accretion rates, which may be connected with galaxy star formation\nrates. We show that the higher cosmological matter density of the Planck\nparameters compared with the WMAP parameters leads to higher abundance of\nmassive halos at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter\n$\\lambda_{\\rm B} = J(2M_{\\rm vir}R_{\\rm vir}V_{\\rm vir})^{-1}$ is nearly\nindependent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is\nconsistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in\nmedian $\\lambda_{\\rm P} = J|E|^{-1/2}G^{-1}M^{-5/2}$ predicts more decrease in\ngalaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson\nrelations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how\ngalaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to\nincreasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases\nbeyond redshifts $z\\sim1$, implying that such velocity-mass relations must\nchange at redshifts $z>1$. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy\nvelocities are related to halo circular velocity, we show that recent optical\nand radio observations of the abundance of galaxies are in good agreement with\nour $\\Lambda$CDM simulations. Our halo demographics are based on updated\nversions of the \\rockstar\\ and \\ctrees\\ codes, and this paper includes\nappendices explaining all of their outputs. This paper is an introduction to a\nseries of related papers presenting other analyses of the Bolshoi-Planck and\nMultiDark-Planck simulations.\n", "  We present exact results on the exactly solvable spin chain of Bravyi et al\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 207202 (2012)]. This model is a spin one chain and has a\nHamiltonian that is local and translationally invariant in the bulk. It has a\nunique (frustration free) ground state with an energy gap that is polynomially\nsmall in the system's size ($2n$). The half-chain entanglement entropy of the\nground state is $\\frac{1}{2}\\log n+const.$. Here we first write the Hamiltonian\nin the standard spin-basis representation. We prove that at zero temperature,\nthe magnetization is along the $z-$direction i.e., $\\langle\ns^{x}\\rangle=\\langle s^{y}\\rangle=0$ (everywhere on the chain). We then\nanalytically calculate $\\langle s^{z}\\rangle$ and the two-point correlation\nfunctions of $s^{z}$. By analytically diagonalizing the reduced density\nmatrices, we calculate the Schmidt rank, von Neumann and R\\'enyi entanglement\nentropies for: 1. Any partition of the chain into two pieces (not necessarily\nin the middle) and 2. $L$ consecutive spins centered in the middle. Further, we\nidentify entanglement Hamiltonians (Eqs. 49 and 59). We prove a small lemma\n(Lemma1) on the combinatorics of lattice paths using the reflection principle\nto relate and calculate the Motzkin walk 'height' to spin expected values. We\nalso calculate the, closely related, (scaled) correlation functions of Brownian\nexcursions. The known features of this model are summarized in a table in\nSec.I.\n", "  Recent experiments reporting unexpectedly large spin Hall effect (SHE) in\ngraphene decorated with adatoms have raised a fierce controversy. We apply\nnumerically exact Kubo and Landauer- B\u007futtiker formulas to realistic models of\ngold-decorated disordered graphene (including adatom clustering) to obtain the\nspin Hall conductivity and spin Hall angle, as well as the nonlocal resistance\nas a quantity accessible to experiments. Large spin Hall angles of 0.1 are\nobtained at zero-temperature, but their dependence on adatom clustering differs\nfrom the predictions of semiclassical transport theories. Furthermore, we find\nmultiple background contributions to the nonlocal resistance, some of which are\nunrelated to SHE or any other spin-dependent origin, as well as a strong\nsuppression of SHE at room temperature. This motivates us to design a\nmultiterminal graphene geometry which suppresses these background contributions\nand could, therefore, quantify the upper limit for spin current generation in\ntwo-dimensional materials.\n", "  We report single crystal growth of the series of CeTAl$_3$ compounds with T =\nCu, Ag, Au, Pd and Pt by means of optical float zoning. High crystalline\nquality was confirmed in a thorough characterization process. With the\nexception of CeAgAl$_3$, all compounds crystallize in the non-centrosymmetric\ntetragonal BaNiSn$_{3}$ structure (space group: I4mm, No. 107), whereas\nCeAgAl$_3$ adopts the related orthorhombic PbSbO$_2$Cl structure (Cmcm, No.\n63). An attempt to grow CeNiAl$_3$ resulted in the composition CeNi$_2$Al$_5$.\nLow temperature resistivity measurements down to $\\sim$0.1K did not reveal\nevidence suggestive of magnetic order in CePtAl$_3$ and CePdAl$_3$. In\ncontrast, CeAuAl$_3$, CeCuAl$_3$ and CeAgAl$_3$ display signatures of magnetic\ntransitions at 1.3K, 2.1K and 3.2K, respectively. This is consistent with\nprevious reports of antiferromagnetic order in CeAuAl$_3$, and CeCuAl$_3$ as\nwell as ferromagnetism in CeAgAl$_3$, respectively.\n", "  Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is a key predictor of climate change.\nHowever, it is not very well constrained, either by climate models or by\nobservational data. The reasons for this include strong internal variability\nand forcing on many time scales. In practise this means that the 'equilibrium'\nwill only be relative to fixing the slow feedback processes before comparing\npalaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In\naddition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that\nthe climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity\nvaries considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing\nrelative strength and time scales over one cycle.\n  In this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate\ndynamics. Using a conceptual Earth system model of Gildor and Tziperman (2001)\n(with Milankovich forcing and dynamical ocean biogeochemistry) we explore\nvarious ways of quantifying the state-dependence of climate sensitivity from\nunperturbed and perturbed model time series. Even without considering any\nperturbations, we suggest that climate sensitivity can be usefully thought of\nas a distribution that quantifies variability within the 'climate attractor'\nand where there is a strong dependence on climate state and more specificially\non the 'climate regime' where fast processes are approximately in equilibrium.\nWe also consider perturbations by instantaneous doubling of CO$_2$ and\nsimilarly find a strong dependence on the climate state using our approach.\n", "  Recently, a temperature-sensitive long-range attraction colloidal system\nexhibiting melting and pre-melting of colloidal crystals has been reported by\nLi et al.[1]. If it is true, it would be an ideal system to simulate a board\nrange of phase transitions happening in atomic systems. We have reanalyzed\ntheir data in [1] and have discovered great inconsistency in their radial\ndistribution functions g(r) and pair potentials u(r). We have tried to\nreproduce their experimental results but failed to find the\ntemperature-sensitive long rang attraction as reported by Li et al. Based on\nour experimental observations, We conclude that the melting and premelting\nreported in their paper are non-equilibrium phenomena caused by non-uniform\ntemperature in the samples of Li et al..\n", "  This work concerns the numerical solution of a coupled system of\nself-consistent reaction-drift-diffusion-Poisson equations that describes the\nmacroscopic dynamics of charge transport in photoelectrochemical (PEC) solar\ncells with reactive semiconductor and electrolyte interfaces. We present three\nnumerical algorithms, mainly based on a mixed finite element and a local\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method for spatial discretization, with carefully chosen\nnumerical fluxes, and implicit-explicit time stepping techniques, for solving\nthe time-dependent nonlinear systems of partial differential equations. We\nperform computational simulations under various model parameters to demonstrate\nthe performance of the proposed numerical algorithms as well as the impact of\nthese parameters on the solution to the model.\n", "  Our general subject is the emergence of phases, and phase transitions, in\nlarge networks subjected to a few variable constraints. Our main result is the\nanalysis, in the model using edge and triangle subdensities for constraints, of\na sharp transition between two phases with different symmetries, analogous to\nthe transition between a fluid and a crystalline solid.\n", "  In this review we present a theory of cosmological constant and Dark Energy\n(DE), based on the topological structure of the vacuum. The Multiple Point\nPrinciple (MPP) is reviewed. It demonstrates the existence of the two vacua\ninto the SM. The Froggatt-Nielsen's prediction of the top-quark and Higgs\nmasses is given in the assumption that there exist two degenerate vacua in the\nSM. This prediction was improved by the next order calculations. We also\nconsidered B.G. Sidharth's theory of cosmological constant based on the\nnon-commutative geometry of the Planck scale space-time, what gives an\nextremely small DE density providing the accelerating expansion of the\nUniverse. Theory of two degenerate vacua - the Planck scale phase and\nElectroweak (EW) phase - also is reviewed, topological defects in these vacua\nare investigated, also the Compton wavelength phase suggested by B.G. Sidharth\nwas discussed. A general theory of the phase transition and the problem of the\nvacuum stability in the SM is reviewed. Assuming that the recently discovered\nat the LHC new resonance with mass $m_S \\simeq 750$ GeV is a new scalar $S$\nbound state $6t + 6\\bar t$, earlier predicted by C.D. Froggatt, H.B. Nielsen\nand L.V. Laperashvili, we try to provide the vacuum stability in the SM and\nexact accuracy of the MPP.\n", "  The microscopic mechanism governing the zero-resistance flow of current in\nsome iron-based, high-temperature superconducting materials is not well\nunderstood up to now. A central issue concerning the investigation of these\nmaterials is their superconducting gap symmetry and structure. Here we present\na combined study of low-temperature specific heat and scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy measurements on single crystalline FeSe. The results reveal the\nexistence of at least two superconducting gaps which can be represented by a\nphenomenological two-band model. The analysis of the specific heat suggests\nsignificant anisotropy in the gap magnitude with deep gap minima. The tunneling\nspectra display an overall \"U\"-shaped gap close to the Fermi level away as well\nas on top of twin boundaries. These results are compatible with the anisotropic\nnodeless models describing superconductivity in FeSe.\n", "  The recently proposed (Phys. Rev. A90 (2014), 062121 and Phys. Rev. A91\n(2015), 052110) group theoretical approach to the problem of breaking the Bell\ninequalities is applied to $S_4$ group. The Bell inequalities based on the\nchoice of three orbits in the representation space corresponding to standard\nrepresentation of $S_4$ are derived and their breaking is described. The\ncorresponding nonlocal games are analyzed.\n", "  We perform a bottom-up search for discrete non-Abelian symmetries capable of\nquantizing the Cabibbo angle that parameterizes CKM mixing. Given a particular\nAbelian symmetry structure in the up and down sectors, we construct\nrepresentations of the associated residual generators which explicitly depend\non the degrees of freedom present in our effective mixing matrix. We then\ndiscretize those degrees of freedom and utilize the Groups, Algorithms,\nProgramming (GAP) package to close the associated finite groups. This short\nstudy is performed in the context of recent results indicating that, without\nresorting to special model-dependent corrections, no small-order finite group\ncan simultaneously predict all four parameters of the three-generation CKM\nmatrix and that only groups of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{2})$ can predict the analogous\nparameters of the leptonic PMNS matrix, regardless of whether neutrinos are\nDirac or Majorana particles. Therefore a natural model of flavour might instead\nincorporate small(er) finite groups whose predictions for fermionic mixing are\ncorrected via other mechanisms.\n", "  We model effects of color fluctuations (CFs) in the light-cone photon wave\nfunction and for the first time make predictions for the distribution over the\nnumber of wounded nucleons $\\nu$ in the inelastic photon-nucleus scattering. We\nshow that CFs lead to a dramatic enhancement of this distribution at $\\nu=1$\nand large $\\nu > 10$. We also study the implications of different scales and\nCFs in the photon wave function on the total transverse energy $\\Sigma E_T$ and\nother observables in inelastic $\\gamma A$ scattering with different triggers.\nOur predictions can be tested in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\nultraperipheral collisions at the LHC and will help to map CFs, whose first\nindications have already been observed at the LHC.\n", "  We present an extension of the GENEVA Monte Carlo framework to include\nmultiple parton interactions (MPI) provided by PYTHIA8. This allows us to\nobtain predictions for underlying-event sensitive measurements in Drell-Yan\nproduction, in conjunction with GENEVA's fully-differential NNLO calculation,\nNNLL' resummation for the 0-jet resolution variable (beam thrust), and NLL\nresummation for the 1-jet resolution variable. We describe the interface with\nthe parton shower algorithm and MPI model of PYTHIA8, which preserves both the\nprecision of partonic N-jet cross sections in GENEVA as well as the shower\naccuracy and good description of soft hadronic physics of PYTHIA8. We present\nresults for several underlying-event sensitive observables and compare to data\nfrom ATLAS and CMS as well as to standalone PYTHIA8 predictions. This includes\na comparison with the recent ATLAS measurement of the beam thrust spectrum,\nwhich provides a potential avenue to fully disentangle the physical effects\nfrom the primary hard interaction, primary soft radiation, multiple parton\ninteractions, and nonperturbative hadronization.\n", "  We explore the momentum analyticity of the static transverse polarization\ntensor of a 2+1 dimensional holographic superconductor in its normal phase with\na nonzero chemical potential, aiming at finding the holographic counterpart of\nthe singularities underlying the Friedel-like oscillations of an ordinary field\ntheory. We prove that the polarization tensor is a meromorphic function with an\ninfinite number of poles located on the complex momentum plane off real axis.\nWith the aid of the WKB approximation these poles are found to lies\nasymptotically along two straight lines parallel to the imaginary axis for a\nlarge momentum magnitude. The similarity between the holographic Green's\nfunction and that of an weakly coupled ordinary field theory (e.g., 2+1\ndimensional QED) regarding the location of the momentum singularities offers\nfurther support to the validity of the gauge/gravity duality.\n", "  Structural, interfacial, optical, and transport properties of large-area MoS2\nultra-thin films on BN-buffered silicon substrates fabricated using magnetron\nsputtering are investigated. A relatively simple growth strategy is\ndemonstrated here that simultaneously promotes superior interfacial and bulk\nMoS2 properties. Few layers of MoS2 are established using X-ray reflectivity,\ndiffraction, ellipsometry, and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Layer-specific\nmodeling of optical constants shows very good agreement with first-principles\ncalculations. Conductivity measurements reveal that few-layer MoS2 films are\nmore conducting than many-layer films. Photo-conductivity measurements reveal\nthat the sputter deposited MoS2 films compare favorably with other large-area\nmethods. Our work illustrates that sputtering is a viable route for large-area\ndevice applications using transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  My collaboration and friendship with John Bell is recollected. I will explain\nhis outstanding contributions in particle physics, in accelerator physics, and\nhis joint work with Mary Bell. Mary's work in accelerator physics is also\nsummarized. I recall our quantum debates, mention some personal reminiscences,\nand give my personal view on Bell's fundamental work on quantum theory, in\nparticular, on the concept of contextuality and nonlocality of quantum physics.\nFinally, I describe the huge influence Bell had on my own work, in particular\non entanglement and Bell inequalities in particle physics and their\nexperimental verification, and on mathematical physics, where some geometric\naspects of the quantum states are illustrated.\n", "  Previous work by various authors has suggested that the detection by\nHerschel/HIFI of nitrogen hydrides along the low density lines of sight towards\nG10.6-0.4 (W31C) cannot be accounted for by gas-phase chemical models. In this\npaper we investigate the role of surface reactions on dust grains in diffuse\nregions, and we find that formation of the hydrides by surface reactions on\ndust grains with efficiency comparable to that for H$_2$ formation reconciles\nmodels with observations of nitrogen hydrides. However, similar surface\nreactions do not contribute significantly to the hydrides of O$^+$ ions\ndetected by Herschel/HIFI present along many sight lines in the Galaxy. The\nO$^+$ hydrides can be accounted for by conventional gas-phase chemistry either\nin diffuse clouds of very low density with normal cosmic ray fluxes or in\nsomewhat denser diffuse clouds with high cosmic ray fluxes. Hydride chemistry\nin dense dark clouds appears to be dominated by gas-phase ion-molecule\nreactions.\n", "  We formulate and implement Cyclic Density Functional Theory (Cyclic DFT) -- a\nself-consistent first principles simulation method for nanostructures with\ncyclic symmetries. Using arguments based on Group Representation Theory, we\nrigorously demonstrate that the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem for such systems\ncan be reduced to a fundamental domain (or cyclic unit cell) augmented with\ncyclic-Bloch boundary conditions. Analogously, the equations of electrostatics\nappearing in Kohn-Sham theory can be reduced to the fundamental domain\naugmented with cyclic boundary conditions. By making use of this symmetry cell\nreduction, we show that the electronic ground-state energy and the\nHellmann-Feynman forces on the atoms can be calculated using quantities defined\nover the fundamental domain. We develop a symmetry-adapted finite-difference\ndiscretization scheme to obtain a fully functional numerical realization of the\nproposed approach. We verify that our formulation and implementation of Cyclic\nDFT is both accurate and efficient through selected examples.\n  The connection of cyclic symmetries with uniform bending deformations\nprovides an elegant route to the ab-initio study of bending in nanostructures\nusing Cyclic DFT. As a demonstration of this capability, we simulate the\nuniform bending of a silicene nanoribbon and obtain its energy-curvature\nrelationship from first principles. A self-consistent ab-initio simulation of\nthis nature is unprecedented and well outside the scope of any other systematic\nfirst principles method in existence. Our simulations reveal that the bending\nstiffness of the silicene nanoribbon is intermediate between that of graphene\nand molybdenum disulphide. We describe several future avenues and applications\nof Cyclic DFT, including its extension to the study of non-uniform bending\ndeformations and its possible use in the study of the nanoscale flexoelectric\neffect.\n", "  In previous work, the author extended the Poincare Lie algebra to include a\nfour position operator as a natural extension to a large fifteen parameter Lie\nalgebra of operators. We here propose to generalize the metric contained in\nthose structure constants to be the Riemann metric as determined by Einstein's\nequations from the energy momentum tensor. This gives a new type of \"Lie\"\nalgebra whose structure constants are space-time dependent. One obtains a new\ntype of uncertainty principle in strong gravitational fields and an altered\nspectra for the hydrogen atom.\n", "  These 1992 lectures notes present a powerful formalism mostly developed in\nthe 1980s by Borderies, Goldreich and Tremaine to address planetary ring\ndynamical issues. These notes make a special emphasis on ring microphysics,\nquantified with the help of the moments of the Boltzmann equation. They also\nfocus on the standard self-gravity model of narrow ring rigid precession, and\non the physics of linear and nonlinear density waves. These notes have been\ncorrected but only very marginally extended and not updated.\n  They are provided both as an introduction to the streamline formalism and as\na complement on some technical issues for my upcoming review (\"Theory of Narrow\nrings and Sharp Edges\") that will cover the physics not addressed here along\nwith more recent developments. This review will appear in the \"Planetary Ring\nSystem\" book (C. Murray and M. Tiscareno, eds.), to be published later on this\nyear at Cambridge University Press.\n", "  The Raychaudhuri equation enables to examine the whole spacetime structure\nwithout specific solutions of Einstein's equations, playing a central role for\nthe understanding of the gravitational interaction in Cosmology. In General\nRelativity, without considering a cosmological constant, a non-positive\ncontribution in the Raychaudhuri equation is usually interpreted as the\nmanifestation of the attractive character of gravity. In this case, particular\nenergy conditions -- indeed the strong energy condition -- must be assumed in\norder to guarantee the attractive character. In the context of f(R) gravity,\nhowever, even assuming the standard energy conditions one may have a positive\ncontribution to the Raychaudhuri equation. Besides providing a simple way to\nexplain the observed cosmic acceleration, this fact opens the possibility of a\nrepulsive character of this kind of gravity. In order to discuss physical\nbounds on f(R) models, we address the attractive/non-attractive character of\nf(R) gravity considering the Raychaudhuri equation and assuming the strong\nenergy condition along with recent estimates of the cosmographic parameters.\n", "  We prove local and global energy decay for the wave equation in a wave guide\nwith damping at infinity. More precisely, the absorption index is assumed to\nconverge slowly to a positive constant, and we obtain the diffusive phenomenon\ntypical for the contribution of low frequencies when the damping is effective\nat infinity. On the other hand, the usual Geometric Control Condition is not\nnecessarily satisfied so we may have a loss of regularity for the contribution\nof high frequencies. Since our results are new even in the Euclidean space, we\nalso state a similar result in this case.\n", "  In social networks, the collective behavior of large populations can be\nshaped by a small set of influencers through a cascading process induced by\n\"peer pressure\". For large-scale networks, efficient identification of multiple\ninfluential spreaders with a linear algorithm in threshold models that exhibit\na first-order transition still remains a challenging task. Here we address this\nissue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of\nbehavior cascading. Our analysis reveals that the importance of spreaders is\nfixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of\nsubcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to\nglobal cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a\nlinearly scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both\nsynthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can\nachieve larger collective influence given same number of seeds compared with\nother linearly scalable heuristic approaches.\n", "  Many methods now exist to prepare free electrons into orbital angular\nmomentum states, and the predicted applications of these electron states as\nprobes of materials and scattering processes are numerous. The development of\nelectron orbital angular momentum measurement techniques has lagged behind. We\nshow that coupling between electron orbital angular momentum and a spatially\nvarying magnetic field produces an angular momentum-dependent focusing effect.\nWe propose a design for an orbital angular momentum measurement device built on\nthis principle. As the method of measurement is non-interferometric, the device\nworks equally well for mixed, superposed and pure final orbital angular\nmomentum states. The energy and orbital angular momentum distributions of\ninelastically scattered electrons may be simultaneously measurable with this\ntechnique.\n", "  A strong analog classical simulation of general quantum evolution is\nproposed, which serves as a novel scheme in quantum computation and simulation.\nThe scheme employs the approach of geometric quantum mechanics and quantum\ninformational technique of quantum tomography, which applies broadly to cases\nof mixed states, nonunitary evolution, and infinite dimensional systems. The\nsimulation provides an intriguing classical picture to probe quantum phenomena,\nnamely, a coherent quantum dynamics can be viewed as a globally constrained\nclassical Hamiltonian dynamics of a collection of coupled particles or strings.\nEfficiency analysis reveals a fundamental difference between the locality in\nreal space and locality in Hilbert space, the latter enables efficient strong\nanalog classical simulations. Examples are also studied to highlight the\ndifferences and gaps among various simulation methods.\n", "  We analyze the uniform system of weakly interacting bosonic gas undergoing\nperiodic oscillation of interaction constant. This, within Bogoliubov\napproximation, leads to creation of atom pairs with well defined opposite\nvelocities. We show how interaction between quasiparticles, omitted in the\nBogoliubov approximation, significantly changes the atom pair creation process\nand properties of scattered atoms.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze Dirac fermions in G\\\"odel-type background\nspace-times with torsion. We also consider the G\\\"odel-type spacetimes embedded\nin a topological defect background. We show that relativistic bound states\nsolutions to the Dirac equation can be obtained by dealing with three cases of\nthe G\\\"odel-type solutions with torsion, where a cosmic string passes through\nthese three cases of the space-time. We obtain the relativistic energy levels\nfor all cases of the G\\\"odel-type solutions with torsion with a cosmic string,\nwhere we show that there exists an analogy with the Landau levels for Dirac\nparticles. We also show that the presence of torsion in the space-time yields\nnew contributions to the relativistic spectrum of energies and that the\npresence of the topological defect modifies the degeneracy of the relativistic\nenergy levels.\n", "  A three-level atomic medium can be made transparent to a resonant probe field\nin the presence of a strong control field acting on an adjacent atomic\ntransition to a long-lived state, which can be represented by a highly excited\nRydberg state. The long-range interactions between the Rydberg state atoms then\ntranslate into strong, non-local, dispersive or absorptive interactions between\nthe probe photons, which can be used to achieve deterministic quantum logic\ngates and single photon sources. Here we show that long-range dipole-dipole\nexchange interaction with one or more spins -- two-level systems represented by\natoms in suitable Rydberg states -- can play the role of control field for the\noptically-dense medium of atoms. This induces transparency of the medium for a\nnumber of probe photons $n_p$ not exceeding the number of spins $n_s$, while\nall the excess photons are resonantly absorbed upon propagation. In the most\npractical case of a single spin atom prepared in the Rydberg state, the medium\nis thus transparent only to a single input probe photon. For larger number of\nspins $n_s$, all $n_p \\leq n_s$ photon components of the probe field would\nexperience transparency but with an $n_p$-dependent group velocity.\n", "  We study a perturbative scheme for normalization problems involving\nresonances of the unperturbed situation, and therefore the necessity of a\nnon-trivial normal form, in the general framework of Banach scale Lie algebras\n(this notion is defined in the article). This situation covers the case of\nclassical and quantum normal forms in a unified way which allows a direct\ncomparison. In particular we prove a precise estimate for the difference\nbetween quantum and classical normal forms, proven to be of order of the square\nof the Planck constant. Our method uses mould calculus (recalled in the\narticle) and properties of the solution of a universal mould equation studied\nin a preceding paper.\n", "  This article sets up a new formalism to investigate stochastic thermodynamics\nin the quantum regime, where stochasticity and irreversibility primarily come\nfrom quantum measurement. In the absence of any bath, we define a purely\nquantum component to heat exchange, that corresponds to energy fluctuations\ncaused by measurement back-action. Energetic and entropic signatures of\nmeasurement induced irreversibility are then investigated for canonical\nexperiments of quantum optics, and the energetic cost of counter-acting\ndecoherence is characterized on a simple state-stabilizing protocol. By placing\nquantum measurement in a central position, our formalism contributes to bridge\na gap between experimental quantum optics and quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  We re-examine the discovery potential at hadron colliders of high-mass\nright-handed (RH) gauge bosons $W_R$ - an inherent ingredient of Left-Right\nSymmetric Models (LRSM). We focus on the regime where the $W_R$ is very heavy\ncompared to the heavy Majorana neutrino $N$, and investigate an alternative\nsignature for $W_R \\rightarrow N$ decays. The produced neutrinos are highly\nboosted in this mass regime. Subsequently, their decays via off-shell $W_R$\nbosons to jets, i.e., $N \\rightarrow \\ell^\\pm j j$ are highly collimated,\nforming a single neutrino jet $(j_N)$. The final-state collider signature is\nthen $\\ell^\\pm j_N$, instead of the widely studied $\\ell^\\pm\\ell^\\pm jj$.\nPresent search strategies are not sensitive to this hierarchical mass regime\ndue to the breakdown of the collider signature definition. We take into account\nQCD corrections beyond next-to-leading order (NLO) that are important for\nhigh-mass Drell-Yan processes at the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For\nthe first time, we evaluate $W_R$ production at NLO with threshold resummation\nat next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (NNLL) matched to the threshold-improved\nparton distributions. With these improvements, we find that a ${W_R}$ of mass\n$M_{W_R} = 3~(4)~[5]$ TeV and mass ratio of $(m_N/M_{W_R})<0.1$ can be\ndiscovered with a $5-6 \\sigma$ statistical significance at 13 TeV after\n${10~(100)~[2000]~\\text{fb}^{-1}}$ of data. Extending the analysis to the\nhypothetical 100 TeV Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC), $5\\sigma$ can be\nobtained for $W_R$ masses up to $M_{W_R}=15~(30)$ with approximately\n$100~\\text{fb}^{-1}~(10~\\text{ab}^{-1})$.\n", "  The Einstein-Hilbert action for general relativity is not well posed in terms\nof the metric $g_{ab}$ as a dynamical variable. There have been many proposals\nto obtain an well posed action principle for general relativity, e.g., addition\nof the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term to the Einstein-Hilbert action. These\nboundary terms are dependent on what one fixes on the boundary and in\nparticular on spacetime dimensions as well. Following recent works of\nPadmanabhan we will introduce two new variables to describe general relativity\nand the action principle with these new dynamical variables will turn out to be\nwell posed. Then we will connect these dynamical variables and boundary term\nobtained thereof to existing literature and shall comment on a few properties\nof Einstein-Hilbert action which might have been unnoticed earlier in the\nliterature. Before concluding with future prospects and discussions, we will\nperform a general analysis of the boundary term of Einstein-Hilbert action for\nnull surfaces as well.\n", "  This paper analyzes write errors in spin torque switching due to thermal\nfluctuations in a system with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy (PMA). Prior\nanalytical and numerical methods are summarized, a physics based Fokker-Planck\nEquation (FPE) chosen for its computational efficiency and broad applicability\nto all switching regimes. The relation between write error slope and material\nparameters is discussed in detail to enable better device engineering and\noptimization. Finally a 2D FPE tool is demonstrated that extends the\napplicability of FPE to write error in non PMA systems with built-in asymmetry.\n", "  We obtain the Weierstrass-Enneper representation for maximal graphs(whose\nGauss map is one-one) in Lorentz-Minkowski space. For this we use the method of\nBarbishov and Chernikov, which they have used to find the solutions of\nBorn-Infeld equation in hodographic coordinates. We could use their method in\nour case, because we realized that the maximal surface equation and Born-Infeld\nequation are related via a wick rotation in the first variable of the\nparametrising domain.\n", "  We calculate current and density distributions in stripe (2D planar)\njunctions between normal and Majorana nanowires having a finite ($y$)\ntransverse length. In presence of a magnetic field with vertical and in-plane\ncomponents, the $y$-symmetry of the charge current distribution in the normal\nlead changes strongly across the Majorana phase transition: from\ncenter-symmetric if a Majorana mode is present to laterally-shifted (as\nexpected by the Hall effect) if the field is tilted such as to destroy the\nMajorana mode due to the projection rule. We compare quasi-particle and charge\ndistributions of current and density, as well as spin magnetizations. The\nMajorana mode causes opposite spin accumulations on the junction and the\nemergence of a spin current.\n", "  We provide a very simple case showing that the weak form of the Heisenberg\nlimit can be beaten while the prior information is improved without bias.\n", "  The analytical expressions for the ultrarelativistic transverse momentum\ndistributions of the Tsallis and the Tsallis-$2$ statistics were obtained. We\nfound that the transverse momentum distribution of the Tsallis-factorized\nstatistics, which is now largely used to describe the experimental transverse\nmomentum spectra of hadrons measured in $pp$ collisions at LHC and RHIC\nenergies, in the ultrarelativistic case is not equivalent to the transverse\nmomentum distributions of the Tsallis and the Tsallis-$2$ statistics. However,\nwe revealed that this distribution exactly coincides with the transverse\nmomentum distribution of the Tsallis-$2$ statistics in the zeroth term\napproximation and is transformed to the transverse momentum distribution of the\nTsallis statistics in the zeroth term approximation by changing the parameter\n$q$ to $1/q_{c}$. We demonstrated analytically on the basis of the\nultrarelativistic ideal gas that the Tsallis-factorized statistics is not\nequivalent to the Tsallis and the Tsallis-$2$ statistics. In the present paper\nthe Tsallis statistics corresponds to the standard expectation values.\n", "  Cold atomic gases resonantly excited to Rydberg states can exhibit strong\noptical nonlinearity at the single photon level. We observe that in such\nsamples radiation trapping leads to an additional mechanism for Rydberg\nexcitation. Conversely we demonstrate that Rydberg excitation provides a novel\nin situ probe of the spectral, statistical, temporal and spatial properties of\nthe trapped re-scattered light. We also show that absorption can lead to an\nexcitation saturation that mimics the Rydberg blockade effect. Collective\neffects due to multiple scattering may co-exist with co-operative effects due\nto long-range interactions between the Rydberg atoms, adding a new dimension to\nquantum optics experiments with cold Rydberg gases.\n", "  We study the background conditions for a bounce uniquely driven by a single\nscalar field model with a generalized kinetic term $K(X)$, without any\nadditional matter field. At the background level we impose the existence of two\nturning points where the derivative of the Hubble parameter $H$ changes sign\nand of a bounce point where the Hubble parameter vanishes. We find the\nconditions for $K(X)$ and the potential which ensure the above requirements. We\nthen give the examples of two models constructed according to these conditions.\nOne is based on a quadratic $K(X)$, and the other a $K(X)$ which is avoiding\ndivergences of the second time derivative of the scalar field, which may\notherwise occur. An appropriate choice of the initial conditions can lead to a\nsequence of consecutive bounces, or oscillations of $H$. In the region where\nthese models have a constant potential they are adiabatic on any scale and\nbecause of this they may not conserve curvature perturbations on super-horizon\nscales. While at the perturbation level one class of models is free from ghosts\nand singularities of the classical equations of motion, in general gradient\ninstabilities are present around the bounce time, because the sign of the\nsquared speed of sound is opposite to the sign of the time derivative of $H$.\nWe discuss how this kind of instabilities could be avoided by modifying the\nLagrangian by introducing Galileion terms in order to prevent a negative\nsquared speed of sound around the bounce.\n", "  When two populations of \"particles\" move in opposite directions, like\noppositely charged colloids under an electric field or intersecting flows of\npedestrians, they can move collectively, forming lanes along their direction of\nmotion. The nature of this \"laning transition\" is still being debated and, in\nparticular, the pair correlation functions, which are the key observables to\nquantify this phenomenon, have not been characterized yet. Here, we determine\nthe correlations using an analytical approach based on a linearization of the\nstochastic equations for the density fields, which is valid for dense systems\nof soft particles. We find that the correlations decay algebraically along the\ndirection of motion, and have a self-similar exponential profile in the\ntransverse direction. Brownian dynamics simulations confirm our theoretical\npredictions and show that they also hold beyond the validity range of our\nanalytical approach, pointing to a universal behavior.\n", "  Nonlinear interactions between ultrashort optical waveforms and solids can be\nused to induce and steer electric current on a femtosecond (fs) timescale,\nholding promise for electronic signal processing at PHz frequencies [Nature\n493, 70 (2013)]. So far, this approach has been limited to insulators,\nrequiring extremely strong peak electric fields and intensities. Here, we show\nall-optical generation and control of directly measurable electric current in a\nsemiconductor relevant for high-speed and high-power (opto)electronics, gallium\nnitride (GaN), within an optical cycle and on a timescale shorter than 2 fs, at\nintensities at least an order of magnitude lower than those required for\ndielectrics. Our approach opens the door to PHz electronics and metrology,\napplicable to low-power (non-amplified) laser pulses, and may lead to future\napplications in semiconductor and photonic integrated circuit technologies.\n", "  The Tsallis statistics was applied to describe the experimental data on the\ntransverse momentum distributions of hadrons. We considered the energy\ndependence of the parameters of the Tsallis-factorized statistics, which is now\nwidely used for the description of the experimental transverse momentum\ndistributions of hadrons, and the Tsallis statistics for the charged pions\nproduced in $pp$ collisions at high energies. We found that the results of the\nTsallis-factorized statistics deviate from the results of the Tsallis\nstatistics only at low NA61/SHINE energies when the value of the entropic\nparameter is close to unity. At higher energies, when the value of the entropic\nparameter deviates essentially from unity, the Tsallis-factorized statistics\nsatisfactorily recovers the results of the Tsallis statistics.\n", "  A general theory of the onset and development of the plasmoid instability is\nformulated by means of a principle of least time. The scaling relations for the\nfinal aspect ratio, transition time to rapid onset, growth rate, and number of\nplasmoids are derived, and shown to depend on the initial perturbation\namplitude $\\left({\\hat w}_0\\right)$, the characteristic rate of current sheet\nevolution $\\left(1/\\tau\\right)$, and the Lundquist number $\\left(S\\right)$.\nThey are not simple power laws, and are proportional to $S^{\\alpha}\n\\tau^{\\beta} \\left[\\ln f(S,\\tau,{\\hat w}_0)\\right]^\\sigma$. The detailed\ndynamics of the instability is also elucidated, and shown to comprise of a\nperiod of quiescence followed by sudden growth over a short time scale.\n", "  Given a Lipschitz function $f:\\{1,...,d\\}^\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, for\neach $\\beta>0$ we denote by $\\mu_\\beta$ the equilibrium measure of $\\beta f$\nand by $h_\\beta$ the main eigenfunction of the Ruelle Operator $L_{\\beta f}$.\nAssuming that $\\{\\mu_{\\beta}\\}_{\\beta>0}$ satisfy a large deviation principle,\nwe prove the existence of the uniform limit $V=\n\\lim_{\\beta\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\log(h_{\\beta})$. Furthermore, the\nexpression of the deviation function is determined by its values at the points\nof the union of the supports of maximizing measures. We study a class of\npotentials having two ergodic maximizing measures and prove that a L.D.P. is\nsatisfied. The deviation function is explicitly exhibited and does not coincide\nwith the one that appears in the paper by Baraviera-Lopes-Thieullen which\nconsiders the case of potentials having a unique maximizing measure.\n", "  Parameter inference with an estimated covariance matrix systematically loses\ninformation due to the remaining uncertainty of the covariance matrix. Here, we\nquantify this loss of precision and develop a framework to hypothetically\nrestore it, which allows to judge how far away a given analysis is from the\nideal case of a known covariance matrix. We point out that it is insufficient\nto estimate this loss by debiasing a Fisher matrix as previously done, due to a\nfundamental inequality that describes how biases arise in non-linear functions.\nWe therefore develop direct estimators for parameter credibility contours and\nthe figure of merit. We apply our results to DES Science Verification weak\nlensing data, detecting a 10% loss of information that increases their\ncredibility contours. No significant loss of information is found for KiDS. For\na Euclid-like survey, with about 10 nuisance parameters we find that 2900\nsimulations are sufficient to limit the systematically lost information to 1%,\nwith an additional uncertainty of about 2%. Without any nuisance parameters\n1900 simulations are sufficient to only lose 1% of information. We also derive\nan estimator for the Fisher matrix of the unknown true covariance matrix, two\nestimators of its inverse with different physical meanings, and an estimator\nfor the optimally achievable figure of merit. The formalism here quantifies the\ngains to be made by running more simulated datasets, allowing decisions to be\nmade about numbers of simulations in an informed way.\n", "  We perform optical spectroscopy measurement across the charge density wave\n(CDW) phase transitions on single-crystal samples of Sr$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$\nand (Sr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$)$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$. Formation of CDW energy gap\nwas clearly observed for both single-crystal samples when they undergo the\nphase transitions. The existence of a Drude component in $\\sigma_1(\\omega)$\nbelow \\TCDW indicates that the Fermi surface is only partially gapped in the\nCDW state. The obtained value of 2$\\Delta$/K$_{B}$T$_{CDW}$ is roughly 13 for\nboth Sr$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ and\n(Sr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$)$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ compounds. The value is\nconsiderably larger than the mean-field value based on the weak-coupling BCS\ntheory. The observed spectral feature in\n(Sr$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$Rh$_{4}$Sn$_{13}$ resembles those seen in many other\nCDW systems.\n", "  The Casimir force is a universal interaction induced by electromagnetic\nquantum fluctuations between any types of objects. The expansion of the\ngraphene family by adding silicene, germanene, and stanene, 2D allotropes of\nSi, Ge, and Sn, lands itself as a platform to probe Dirac-like physics in\nhoneycomb staggered systems in such a ubiquitous interaction. We discover\nCasimir force phase transitions between these staggered 2D materials induced by\nthe complex interplay between Dirac physics, spin-orbit coupling, and\nexternally applied fields. In particular, we find that the interaction energy\nexperiences different power law distance decays, magnitudes, and dependences on\ncharacteristic physical constants. Furthermore, due to the topological\nproperties of these materials, repulsive and quantized Casimir interactions\nbecome possible.\n", "  Resource states that contain nontrivial symmetry-protected topological order\nare identified for universal single-qudit measurement-based quantum\ncomputation. Our resource states fall into two classes: one as the qudit\ngeneralizations of the 1D qubit cluster state, and the other as the\nhigher-symmetry generalizations of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki\n(AKLT) state, namely, with unitary, orthogonal, or symplectic symmetry. The\nsymmetry in cluster states protects information propagation (identity gate),\nwhile the higher symmetry in AKLT-type states enables nontrivial gate\ncomputation. This work demonstrates a close connection between\nmeasurement-based quantum computation and symmetry-protected topological order.\n", "  Motivated by their necessity for most fault-tolerant quantum computation\nschemes, we formulate a resource theory for magic states. We first show that\nrobustness of magic is a well-behaved magic monotone that operationally\nquantifies the classical simulation overhead for a Gottesman-Knill type scheme\nusing ancillary magic states. Our framework subsequently finds immediate\napplication in the task of synthesizing non-Clifford gates using magic states.\nWhen magic states are interspersed with Clifford gates, Pauli measurements and\nstabilizer ancillas - the most general synthesis scenario - then the class of\nsynthesizable unitaries is hard to characterize. Our techniques can place\nnon-trivial lower bounds on the number of magic states required for\nimplementing a given target unitary. Guided by these results we have found new\nand optimal examples of such synthesis.\n", "  We study magnetic solitons, solitary waves of spin polarization (i.e.,\nmagnetization), in binary Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of Rabi\ncoupling. We show that the system exhibits two types of magnetic solitons,\ncalled $2\\pi$ and $0\\pi$ solitons, characterized by a different behavior of the\nrelative phase between the two spin components. $2\\pi$ solitons exhibit a\n$2\\pi$ jump of the relative phase, independent of their velocity, the static\ndomain wall explored by Son and Stephanov being an example of such $2\\pi$\nsolitons with vanishing velocity and magnetization. $0\\pi$ solitons instead do\nnot exhibit any asymptotic jump in the relative phase. Systematic results are\nprovided for both types of solitons in uniform matter. Numerical calculations\nin the presence of a one-dimensional harmonic trap reveal that a $2\\pi$ soliton\nevolves in time into a $0\\pi$ soliton, and vice versa, oscillating around the\ncenter of the trap. Results for the effective mass, the Landau critical\nvelocity, and the role of the transverse confinement are also discussed.\n", "  The anarchy principle leading to the see-saw ensemble is studied analytically\nwith the usual tools of random matrix theory. The probability density function\nfor the see-saw ensemble of $N\\times N$ matrices is obtained in terms of a\nmultidimensional integral. This integral involves all light neutrino masses,\nleading to a complicated probability density function. It is shown that the\nprobability density function for the neutrino mixing angles and phases is the\nappropriate Haar measure. The decoupling of the light neutrino masses and\nneutrino mixings implies no correlation between the neutrino mass eigenstates\nand the neutrino mixing matrix and leads to a loss of predictive power when\ncomparing with observations. This decoupling is in agreement with some of the\nclaims found in the literature.\n", "  We propose a method for sorting electrons by orbital angular momentum (OAM).\nSeveral methods now exist to prepare electron wavefunctions in OAM states, but\nno technique has been developed for efficient, parallel measurement of pure and\nmixed electron OAM states. The proposed technique draws inspiration from the\nrecent demonstration of the sorting of OAM through modal transformation. We\nshow that the same transformation can be performed with electrostatic electron\noptical elements. Specifically, we show that a charged needle and an array of\nelectrodes perform the transformation and phase correction necessary to sort\norbital angular momentum states. This device may enable the analysis of the\nspatial mode distribution of inelastically scattered electrons.\n", "  In quantum many-body systems with a U(1) symmetry, such as the particle\nnumber conservation and the axial spin conservation, there are two distinct\ntypes of excitations: charge-neutral excitations and charged excitations. The\nenergy gaps of these excitations may be independent with each other in strongly\ncorrelated systems. The static susceptibility of the U(1) charge vanishes when\nthe charged excitations are all gapped, but its relation to the neutral\nexcitations is not obvious. Here we show that a finite excitation gap of the\nneutral excitations is, in fact, sufficient to prove that the charge\nsusceptibility vanishes (i.e. the system is incompressible). This result gives\na partial explanation on why the celebrated quantization condition\n$n(S-m_z)\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ at magnetization plateaus works even in spatial\ndimensions greater than one.\n", "  We study scenarios where a scalar field has a spatially varying vacuum\nexpectation value such that the total field variation is super-Planckian. We\nfocus on the case where the scalar field controls the coupling of a U(1) gauge\nfield, which allows us to apply the Weak Gravity Conjecture to such\nconfigurations. We show that this leads to evidence for a conjectured property\nof quantum gravity that as a scalar field variation in field space asymptotes\nto infinity there must exist an infinite tower of states whose mass decreases\nas an exponential function of the scalar field variation. We determine the rate\nat which the mass of the states reaches this exponential behaviour showing that\nit occurs quickly after the field variation passes the Planck scale.\n", "  In this work, it is shown that image reconstruction methods from ultrasonic\nimaging can be employed for thermographic signals. Before using these imaging\nmethods, a virtual signal is calculated by applying a local transformation to\nthe temperature evolution measured on a sample surface. The introduced\ntransformation describes all the irreversibility of the heat diffusion process\nand can be used for every sample shape. To date, one-dimensional methods have\nbeen primarily used in thermographic imaging. The proposed two-stage algorithm\nenables reconstruction in two and three dimensions. The feasibility of this\napproach is demonstrated through simulations and experiments. For the latter,\nsmall steel beads embedded in an epoxy resin are imaged. The resolution limit\nis found to be proportional to the depth of the structures and to be inversely\nproportional to the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio. Limited-view\nartefacts can arise if the measurement is performed on a single planar\ndetection surface. These artifacts can be reduced by measuring the\nthermographic signals from multiple planes, which is demonstrated by numerical\nsimulations and by experiments performed on an epoxy cube.\n", "  We consider the sedimentation of a colloidal gel under confinement in the\ndirection of gravity. The confinement allows us to compare directly experiments\nand computer simulations, for the same system size in the vertical direction.\nThe confinement also leads to qualitatively different behaviour compared to\nbulk systems: in large systems gelation suppresses sedimentation, but for small\nsystems sedimentation is enhanced relative to non-gelling suspensions, although\nthe rate of sedimentation is reduced when the strength of the attraction\nbetween the colloids is strong. We map interaction parameters between a model\nexperimental system (observed in real space) and computer simulations.\nRemarkably, we find that when simulating the system using Brownian dynamics in\nwhich hydrodynamic interactions between the particles are neglected, we find\nthat sedimentation occurs on the same timescale as the experiments, however the\nthickness of the \"arms\" of the gel is rather larger in the experiments,\ncompared with the simulations. An analysis of local structure in the\nsimulations showed similar behaviour to gelation in the absence of gravity.\n", "  The SYK model: fermions with a $q$-body, Gaussian-random, all-to-all\ninteraction, is the first of a fascinating new class of solvable large $N$\nmodels. We generalize SYK to include $f$ flavors of fermions, each occupying\n$N_a$ sites and appearing with a $q_a$ order in the interaction. Like SYK, this\nentire class of models generically has an infrared fixed point. We compute the\ninfrared dimensions of the fermions, and the spectrum of singlet bilinear\noperators. We show that there is always a dimension-two operator in the\nspectrum, which implies that, like in SYK, there is breaking of conformal\ninvariance and maximal chaos in the infrared four-point function of the\ngeneralized model. After a disorder average, the generalized model has a global\n$O(N_1) \\times O(N_2) \\times \\ldots\\times O(N_f)$ symmetry: a subgroup of the\n$O(N)$ symmetry of SYK; thereby giving a richer spectrum. We also elucidate\naspects of the large $q$ limit and the OPE, and solve $q=2$ SYK at finite $N$.\n", "  A supermassive black hole moving through a field of stars will\ngravitationally scatter the stars, inducing a backreaction force on the black\nhole known as dynamical friction. In Newtonian gravity, the axisymmetry of the\nsystem about the black hole's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ implies that the dynamical\nfriction must be anti-parallel to $\\mathbf{v}$. However, in general relativity\nthe black hole's spin $\\mathbf{S}$ need not be parallel to $\\mathbf{v}$,\nbreaking the axisymmetry of the system and generating a new component of\ndynamical friction similar to the Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{v}\n\\times \\mathbf{B}$ experienced by a particle with charge $q$ moving in a\nmagnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. We call this new force gravitomagnetic dynamical\nfriction and calculate its magnitude for a spinning black hole moving through a\nfield of stars with Maxwellian velocity dispersion $\\sigma$, assuming that both\n$v$ and $\\sigma$ are much less than the speed of light $c$. We use\npost-Newtonian equations of motion accurate to $\\mathcal{O}(v^3/c^3)$ needed to\ncapture the effect of spin-orbit coupling and also include direct stellar\ncapture by the black hole's event horizon. Gravitomagnetic dynamical friction\nwill cause a black hole with uniform speed to spiral about the direction of its\nspin, similar to a charged particle spiraling about a magnetic field line, and\nwill exert a torque on a supermassive black hole orbiting a galactic center,\ncausing the angular momentum of this orbit to slowly precess about the\nblack-hole spin. As this effect is suppressed by a factor $(\\sigma/c)^2$ in\nnonrelativistic systems, we expect it to be negligible in most astrophysical\ncontexts but provide this calculation for its theoretical interest and\npotential application to relativistic systems.\n", "  Numerical simulations of spin glass models with continuous variables set the\nproblem of a reliable but efficient discretization of such variables. In\nparticular, the main question is how fast physical observables computed in the\ndiscretized model converge toward the ones of the continuous model when the\nnumber of states of the discretized model increases. We answer this question\nfor the XY model and its discretization, the $q$-state clock model, in the\nmean-field setting provided by random graphs. It is found that the convergence\nof physical observables is exponentially fast in the number $q$ of states of\nthe clock model, so allowing a very reliable approximation of the XY model by\nusing a rather small number of states. Furthermore, such an exponential\nconvergence is found to be independent from the disorder distribution used.\nOnly at $T=0$ the convergence is slightly slower (stretched exponential).\nThanks to the analytical solution to the $q$-state clock model, we compute\naccurate phase diagrams in the temperature versus disorder strength plane. We\nfind that, at zero temperature, spontaneous replica symmetry breaking takes\nplace for any amount of disorder, even an infinitesimal one. We also study the\none step of replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) solution in the low-temperature\nspin glass phase.\n", "  In the paper we discuss contribution of the doubly intrinsic heavy mechanism\ninto the production of $B_c$ meson, the doubly heavy baryons and the all-charm\ntetraquark at a future fixed-target experiment at the LHC (AFTER@LHC). The\nproduction cross sections and the mean values of Feynman-x for the finale\nstates are presented.\n", "  We study using Monte Carlo simulations the finite-size scaling behavior of\nthe interfacial adsorption of the two-dimensional square-lattice $q$-states\nPotts model. We consider the pure and random-bond versions of the Potts model\nfor $q = 3,4,5,8$ and $q = 10$, thus probing the interfacial properties at the\noriginally continuous, weak, and strong first-order phase transitions. For the\npure systems our results support the early scaling predictions for the size\ndependence of the interfacial adsorption at both first- and second-order phase\ntransitions. For the disordered systems, the interfacial adsorption at the\n(disordered induced) continuous transitions is discussed, applying standard\nscaling arguments and invoking findings for bulk critical properties. The\nself-averaging properties of the interfacial adsorption are also analyzed by\nstudying the infinite limit-size extrapolation of properly defined\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n", "  The arrival times, positions, and fluxes of multiple images in strong lens\nsystems can be used to infer the presence of dark subhalos in the deflector,\nand thus test predictions of cold dark matter models. However, gravitational\nlensing does not distinguish between perturbations to a smooth gravitational\npotential arising from baryonic and non-baryonic mass. In this work, we\nquantify the extent to which the stellar mass distribution of a deflector can\nreproduce flux ratio and astrometric anomalies typically associated with the\npresence of a dark matter subhalo. Using Hubble Space Telescope images of\nnearby galaxies, we simulate strong lens systems with real distributions of\nstellar mass as they would be observed at redshift $z_d=0.5$. We add a dark\nmatter halo and external shear to account for the smooth dark matter field,\nomitting dark substructure, and use a Monte Carlo procedure to characterize the\ndistributions of image positions, time delays, and flux ratios for a compact\nbackground source of diameter 5 pc. By convolving high-resolution images of\nreal galaxies with a Gaussian PSF, we simulate the most detailed smooth\npotential one could construct given high quality data, and find scatter in flux\nratios of $\\approx 10\\%$, which we interpret as a typical deviation from a\nsmooth potential caused by large and small scale structure in the lensing\ngalaxy. We demonstrate that the flux ratio anomalies arising from galaxy-scale\nbaryonic structure can be minimized by selecting the most massive and round\ndeflectors, and by simultaneously modeling flux ratio and astrometric data.\n", "  The layered lanthanum silver antimonide LaAgSb$_2$ was known to experience\ntwo charge density (CDW) phase transitions, which were proposed recently to be\nclosely related to the newly identified Dirac cone. We present optical\nspectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe measurement on the compound. The\ndevelopment of energy gaps were clearly observed below the phase transition\ntemperatures in optical conductivity, which removes most part of the free\ncarrier spectral weight. Time resolved measurement demonstrated the emergence\nof strong oscillations upon entering the CDW states, which were illuminated to\ncome from the amplitude mode of CDW collective excitations. The frequencies of\nthem are surprisingly low: only 0.12 THz for the CDW order with higher\ntransition temperature and 0.34 THz for the lower one, which shall be caused by\ntheir small modulation wave vectors. Furthermore, the amplitude and relaxation\ntime of photoinduced reflectivity stayed unchanged across the two phase\ntransitions, which might be connected to the extremely low energy scales of\namplitude modes.\n", "  The diagonal ensemble is the infinite time average of a quantum state\nfollowing unitary dynamics. In analogy to the time average of a classical phase\nspace dynamics, it is intimately related to the ergodic properties of the\nquantum system giving information on the spreading of the initial state in the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In this work we apply a concept from quantum\ninformation, known as total correlations, to the diagonal ensemble. Forming an\nupper-bound on the multipartite entanglement, it quantifies the combination of\nboth classical and quantum correlations in a mixed state. We generalize the\ntotal correlations of the diagonal ensemble to more general $\\alpha$-Renyi\nentropies and focus on the the cases $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=2$ with further\nnumerical extensions in mind. Here we show that the total correlations of the\ndiagonal ensemble is a generic indicator of ergodicity breaking, displaying a\nsub-extensive behaviour when the system is ergodic. We demonstrate this by\ninvestigating its scaling in a range of spin chain models focusing not only on\nthe cases of integrability breaking but also emphasize its role in\nunderstanding the transition from an ergodic to a many body localized phase in\nsystems with disorder or quasi-periodicity.\n", "  In this work, the so-called Eshelbian or configurational mechanics of\nquasicrystals is presented. Quasicrystals are considered as a prototype of\nnovel materials. Material balance laws for quasicrystalline materials with\ndislocations are derived in the framework of generalized incompatible\nelasticity theory of quasicrystals. Translations, scaling transformations as\nwell as rotations are examined; the latter presents particular interest due to\nthe quasicrystalline structure. This derivation provides important quantities\nof the Eshelbian mechanics, as the Eshelby stress tensor, the scaling flux\nvector, the angular momentum tensor, the configurational forces (Peach-Koehler\nforce, Cherepanov force, inhomogeneity force or Eshelby force), the\nconfigurational work and the configurational vector moments for dislocations in\nquasicrystals. The corresponding $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocation\nloops and straight dislocations in quasicrystals are derived and discussed.\nMoreover, the explicit formulas of the $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for\nparallel screw dislocations in one-dimensional hexagonal quasicrystals are\nobtained. Through this derivation, the physical interpretation of the $J$-,\n$M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocations in quasicrystals is revealed and their\nconnection to the Peach-Koehler force, the interaction energy and the\nrotational vector moment (torque) of dislocations in quasicrystals is\nestablished.\n", "  The angular momentum of light can be described by the states of spin angular\nmomentum, associated with polarization, and orbital angular momentum, related\nto the helical structure of the wave front. Laguerre-Gaussian beams carry\norbital angular momentum and their generation can be done by using an optical\ndevice known as q-plate. However, due to the usage of liquid crystals, these\ncomponents may be restricted to operate in specific wavelengths and low power\nsources. Here we present the fabrication and characterization of q-plates made\nwithout liquid crystals, using processes of e-beam lithography, atomic layer\ndepositions and dry etch techniques. We exploit the phenomenon of form\nbirefringence to give rise to the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion.\nWe demonstrate that these plates can generate beams with high quality for the\nUV and IR range, allowing them to interact with high power laser sources or\ninside laser cavities.\n", "  The magnetization process and adiabatic demagnetization of the\nantiferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg clusters with the shape of regular\npolyhedra (tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron and dodecahedron) are\nexamined using the exact diagonalization method. It is demonstrated that a\nquantum (xy) part of the XXZ exchange interaction is a primary cause for\npresence of additional intermediate magnetization plateaux and steps, which are\ntotally absent in the limiting Ising case. The only exception to this rule is\nthe spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg tetrahedron, which shows just a quantitative shift\nof the level-crossing fields related to two magnetization steps. It is\nevidenced that the spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg regular polyhedra exhibit an\nenhanced magnetocaloric effect in a proximity of the magnetization steps and\njumps, which are accompanied with a rapid drop (rise) of temperature just above\n(below) of the level-crossing field when the magnetic field is removed\nadiabatically.\n", "  We report on the electronic transport properties of black phosphorus and\nanalyze them using a two-carrier model in a wide range of pressure up to 2.5\nGPa. In semiconducting state at 0.29 GPa, the remarkable non-linear behavior in\nthe Hall resistance is reasonably reproduced by assuming the coexistence of two\nkinds of hole with different densities and mobilities. On the other hand,\ntwo-carrier analyses of the magnetotransport properties above 1.01 GPa suggest\nthe coexistence of high mobility electron and hole carriers that have almost\nthe same densities, i.e., nearly compensated semimetallic nature of black\nphosphorus. In the semimetallic state, analyses of both the two-carrier model\nand quantum oscillations indicate a systematic increase in the carrier\ndensities as pressure increases. An observed sign inversion of Hall resistivity\nat low magnetic fields suggests the existence of high mobility electrons\n(\\sim105 cm2 V-1 s-1) that is roughly ten times larger than that of holes, in\nthe semimetallic black phosphorus. We conclude that the extremely large\npositive magnetoresistance that has been observed in semimetallic state cannot\nbe reproduced by a conventional two-carrier model.\n", "  We study the influence of the proximity-induced pairing on electronic version\nof the Dicke effect in a heterostructure, comprising three quantum dots\nvertically coupled between the metallic and superconducting leads. We discuss a\nfeasible experimental procedure for detecting the narrow/broad\n(subradiant/superradiant) contributions by means of the subgap Andreev\nspectroscopy. In the Kondo regime and for small energy level detuning the Dicke\neffect is manifested in the differential conductance.\n", "  We study the development of caustics in shift-symmetric scalar field theories\nby focusing on simple waves with an $SO(p)$-symmetry in an arbitrary number of\nspace dimensions. We show that the pure Galileon, the DBI-Galileon, and the\nextreme-relativistic Galileon naturally emerge as the unique set of\ncaustic-free theories, highlighting a link between the caustic-free condition\nfor simple $SO(p)$-waves and the existence of either a global Galilean symmetry\nor a global (extreme-)relativistic Galilean symmetry.\n", "  We present a low-complexity algorithm to calculate the correlation energy of\nperiodic systems in second-order M\\o ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). In\ncontrast to previous approximation-free MP2 codes, our implementation possesses\na quartic scaling, $\\mathcal O (N^4)$, with respect to the system size $N$ and\noffers an almost ideal parallelization efficiency. The general issue that the\ncorrelation energy converges slowly with the number of basis functions is eased\nby an internal basis set extrapolation. The key concept to reduce the scaling\nis to eliminate all summations over virtual orbitals which can be elegantly\nachieved in the Laplace transformed MP2 (LTMP2) formulation using plane wave\nbasis sets and Fast Fourier transforms. Analogously, this approach could allow\nto calculate second order screened exchange (SOSEX) as well as particle-hole\nladder diagrams with a similar low complexity. Hence, the presented method can\nbe considered as a step towards systematically improved correlation energies.\n", "  A search for the non-resonant decays $B^0_s \\rightarrow\n\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and $B^0 \\rightarrow\n\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ is presented. The measurement is performed using\nthe full Run 1 data set collected in proton-proton collisions by the LHCb\nexperiment at the LHC. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of $1$\nand $2~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ and\n$8~\\mathrm{TeV}$, respectively. No signal is observed and upper limits on the\nbranching fractions of the non-resonant decays at $95\\%$ confidence level are\ndetermined to be\n  \\mathcal{B}(B^0_s \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}) & < 2.5 \\times\n10^{-9}\n  \\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}) & < 6.9 \\times\n10^{-10}.\n", "  Players of coevolutionary games may update not only their strategies but also\ntheir networks of interaction. Based on interpreting the payoff of players as\nfitness, dynamic landscape models are proposed. The modeling procedure is\ncarried out for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) games that both use\neither birth--death (BD) or death--birth (DB) strategy updating. The main focus\nis on using dynamic fitness landscapes as a mathematical model of\ncoevolutionary game dynamics. Hence, an alternative tool for analyzing\ncoevolutionary games becomes available, and landscape measures such as\nmodality, ruggedness and information content can be computed and analyzed. In\naddition, fixation properties of the games and quantifiers characterizing the\ninteraction networks are calculated numerically. Relations are established\nbetween landscape properties expressed by landscape measures and quantifiers of\ncoevolutionary game dynamics such as fixation probabilities, fixation times and\nnetwork properties.\n", "  The baryon/skyrmion correspondence implies that the baryon number is encoded\ninto a topological surface integral. Under certain conditions that we clarify,\nthis surface integral can be measured by an asymptotic observer in form of an\nAharonov-Bohm phase-shift in an experiment in which the skyrmion passes through\na loop of a probe string. In such a setup the baryon/skyrmion number must be\nrespected by black holes, despite the fact that it produces no long-range\nclassical field. If initially swallowed by a black hole, the baryon number must\nresurface in form of a classical skyrmion hair, after the black hole evaporates\nbelow a certain critical size. Needless to say, the respect of the baryon\nnumber by black holes is expected to have potentially-interesting astrophysical\nconsequences.\n", "  We study statistical properties of the $0^+$ spectrum of $^{208}$Pb in the\nenergy region $E_x\\leq20$ MeV. We use the Skyrme interaction SLy4 as our model\nHamiltonian to create a single-particle spectrum and to analyze excited states.\nThe finite-rank separable approximation for the particle-hole interaction\nenables us to perform the calculations in large configuration spaces. We show\nthat while the position of the monopole resonance centroid is determined by one\nphonon excitations of $0^+$, the phonon-phonon coupling is crucial for the\ndescription of a strength distribution of the $0^+$ spectrum. In fact, this\ncoupling has an impact on the spectral rigidity $\\Delta_3(L)$ which is shifted\ntowards the random matrix limit of the Gaussian orthogonal ensembles.\n", "  For a projective measurement, the Born rule provides the probability for an\noutcome in terms of the inner product between a projector and a quantum state.\nIf the projector represents a pure entangled state and the state for a\ncomposite system is separable, then we cannot get probability 1 for the\noutcome. This insight delivers a single condition for entanglement detection.\nBy applying local unitary transformations from the Clifford group, we turn one\ncondition into many. Furthermore, we present two equivalent schemes---one\nemploys global and other requires local projective measurements---to test these\nconditions in an experiment. Here, a global measurement is characterized by an\northonormal basis that holds local-unitary-equivalent entangled kets. Whereas a\nlocal-measurement setting is specified by mutually unbiased bases assigned to\nthe subsystems. We also supply a straightforward (computer) algorithm to\ngenerate all the conditions and then to check whether a state is shown\nentangled or not by these conditions. Finally, we demonstrate every element of\nour schemes by considering several well-known examples of entangled kets and\nstates.\n", "  We consider a two-Higgs-doublet extension of the Standard Model, with three\nright-handed neutrino singlets and the seesaw mechanism, wherein all the\nYukawa-coupling matrices are lepton flavour-diagonal and lepton flavour\nviolation is soft, originating solely in the non-flavour-diagonal Majorana mass\nmatrix of the right-handed neutrinos. We consider the limit $m_R \\to \\infty$ of\nthis model, where $m_R$ is the seesaw scale. We demonstrate that there is a\nregion in parameter space where the branching ratios of all five charged-lepton\ndecays $\\ell_1^- \\to \\ell_2^- \\ell_3^+ \\ell_3^-$ are close to their\nexperimental upper bounds, while the radiative decays $\\ell_1^- \\to \\ell_2^-\n\\gamma$ are invisible because their branching ratios are suppressed by\n$m_R^{-4}$. We also consider the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and show\nthat in our model the contributions from the extra scalars, both charged and\nneutral, can remove the discrepancy between its experimental and theoretical\nvalues.\n", "  The non-resonant THz response of CMOS FET has been analyzed based on static\nnon-linearities of the transistor channel. Under the quasi-static limit, the\nsecond order non-linearities dominantly determine the DC current in the channel\ngenerated in response to THz signal. For the applied gate-to source and\ndrain-to-source signals, the significance of the second order non-linear terms\nis analyzed as a function of DC bias conditions. Based on the analysis, it has\nalso been shown that a differential detector topology can give highest\nresponsivity in cold operation. A tradeoff between the channel resistance and\nload impedance plays a vital role in detecting the generated current. Moreover,\nthe design considerations such as readout modes, optimum bias points and device\ndimensions are also discussed with respect to both responsivity and noise\nequivalent power (NEP).\n", "  This review is devoted to the study of charm production in ep and pp\ncollisions. The total set of measurements obtained by the two collaborations H1\nand ZEUS from HERA and their combination is outlined, as well as complementary\ndata obtained by the LHCb collaboration at the LHC. After fitting the parton\ndistribution functions the charm production cross sections are predicted within\nperturbative QCD at next-to-leading order using the fixed-flavour-number\nscheme. Agreement with the data is found. The combined HERA charm data are\nsensitive to the $c$-quark mass and enabled its accurate determination. The\npredictions crucially depend upon the knowledge of the gluon distribution\nfunction. It is shown that the shape of the gluon distribution based on the\nHERA data is considerably improved by adding the measurements from LHCb and\napplicable down to values x of about 10^{-6}, where x is the proton momentum\nfraction carried by a parton.\n", "  The most widely studied scenario in dark matter phenomenology is the thermal\nWIMP scenario. Inspite of numerous efforts to detect WIMP, till now we have no\ndirect evidence for it. A possible explanation for this non-observation of dark\nmatter could be because of its very feeble interaction strength and hence,\nfailing to thermalise with the rest of the cosmic soup. In other words, the\ndark matter might be of non-thermal origin where the relic density is obtained\nby the so-called freeze-in mechanism. Furthermore, if this non-thermal dark\nmatter is itself produced substantially from the decay of another non-thermal\nmother particle, then their distribution functions may differ in both size and\nshape from the usual equilibrium distribution function. In this work, we have\nstudied such a non-thermal (fermionic) dark matter scenario in the light of a\nnew type of $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ model. The $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ model is interesting,\nsince, besides being anomaly free, it can give rise to neutrino mass by Type II\nsee-saw mechanism. Moreover, as we will show, it can accommodate a non-thermal\nfermionic dark matter as well. Starting from the collision terms, we have\ncalculated the momentum distribution function for the dark matter by solving a\ncoupled system of Boltzmann equations. We then used it to calculate the final\nrelic abundance, as well as other relevant physical quantities. We have also\ncompared our result with that obtained from solving the usual Boltzmann (or\nrate) equations directly in terms of comoving number density, $Y$. Our findings\nsuggest that the latter approximation is valid only in cases where the system\nunder study is close to equilibrium, and hence should be used with caution.\n", "  In a Kondo lattice, the spin exchange coupling between a local spin and the\nconduction electrons acquires nonlocal contributions due to conduction electron\nscattering from surrounding local spins and the subsequent RKKY interaction. It\nleads to a hitherto unrecognized interference of Kondo screening and the RKKY\ninteraction beyond the Doniach scenario. We develop a renormalization group\ntheory for the RKKY-modified Kondo vertex. The Kondo temperature, $T_K(y)$, is\nsuppressed in a universal way, controlled by the antiferromagnetic RKKY\ncoupling parameter $y$. Complete spin screening ceases to exist beyond a\ncritical RKKY strength $y_c$ even in the absence of magnetic ordering. At this\nbreakdown point, $T_K(y)$ remains nonzero and is not defined for larger RKKY\ncouplings, $y>y_c$. The results are in quantitative agreement with STM\nspectroscopy experiments on tunable two-impurity Kondo systems. The possible\nimplications for quantum critical scenarios in heavy-fermion systems are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this work we put forward an effective Gaussian free field description of\ncritical wavefunctions at the transition between plateaus of the integer\nquantum Hall effect. To this end, we expound our earlier proposal that powers\nof critical wave intensities prepared via point contacts behave as pure scaling\nfields obeying an Abelian operator product expansion. Our arguments employ the\nframework of conformal field theory and, in particular, lead to a\nmultifractality spectrum which is parabolic. We also derive a number of old and\nnew identities that hold exactly at the lattice level and hinge on the\ncorrespondence between the Chalker-Coddington network model and a\nsupersymmetric vertex model.\n", "  Three-dimensional random electron systems undergo quantum phase transitions\nand show rich phase diagrams. Examples of the phases are the band gap\ninsulator, Anderson insulator, strong and weak topological insulators, Weyl\nsemimetal, and diffusive metal. As in the previous paper on two-dimensional\nquantum phase transitions [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. vol. 85, 123706 (2016)], we use\nan image recognition algorithm based on a multilayered convolutional neural\nnetwork to identify which phase the eigenfunction belongs to. The Anderson\nmodel for localization-delocalization transition, the Wilson--Dirac model for\ntopological insulators, and the layered Chern insulator model for Weyl\nsemimetal are studied. The situation where the standard transfer matrix\napproach is not applicable is also treated by this method.\n", "  Interest in the idea that primordial black holes (PBHs) might comprise some\nor all of the dark matter has recently been rekindled following LIGO's first\ndirect detection of a binary-black-hole merger. Here we revisit the effect of\naccreting PBHs on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) frequency spectrum and\nangular temperature/polarization power spectra. We compute the accretion rate\nand luminosity of PBHs, accounting for their suppression by Compton drag and\nCompton cooling by CMB photons. We estimate the gas temperature near the\nSchwarzschild radius, and hence the free-free luminosity, accounting for the\ncooling resulting from collisional ionization when the background gas is mostly\nneutral. We account approximately for the velocities of PBHs with respect to\nthe background gas. We provide a simple analytic estimate of the efficiency of\nenergy deposition in the plasma. We find that the spectral distortions\ngenerated by accreting PBHs are too small to be detected by FIRAS, as well as\nby future experiments now being considered. We analyze Planck CMB temperature\nand polarization data and find, under our most conservative hypotheses, and at\nthe order-of-magnitude level, that they rule out PBHs with masses >~ 10^2 M_sun\nas the dominant component of dark matter.\n", "  We derive exact physical consequences of particle-hole symmetry of the\n$\\nu=1/2$ state of electrons in a strong magnetic field. We show that if the\nsymmetry is not spontaneously broken, the Hall conductivity and the\nsusceptibility satisfy an exact relationship, valid at any wave numbers and any\nfrequencies much below the cyclotron frequency. The relationship holds for\nclean systems and also for systems with statistically particle-hole symmetric\ndisorder. We work out the constraints this relationship imposes on the theory\nof the Dirac composite fermion. We also argue that that the exact relationship\nis violated in the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) field theory and present an explicit\ncalculation within a Galilean invariant mean-field approximation to the HLR\ntheory to illustrate the breakdown.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT)\nwe investigated the effects of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions on the\nstructural and electronic properties of anthracene and pentacene adsorbed on\nthe Ag(111) surface. We found that the inclusion of vdW corrections strongly\naffects the binding of both anthracene/Ag(111) and pentacene/Ag(111), yielding\nadsorption heights and energies more consistent with the experimental results\nthan standard DFT calculations with generalized gradient approximation (GGA).\nFor anthracene/Ag(111) the effect of the vdW interactions is even more\ndramatic: we found that pure DFT-GGA calculations (without including vdW\ncorrections) result in preference for a tilted configuration, in contrast to\nexperimental observations of flat-lying adsorption; including vdW corrections,\non the other hand, alters the binding geometry of anthracene/Ag(111), favoring\nthe flat configuration. The electronic structure obtained using a\nself-consistent vdW scheme was found to be nearly indistinguishable from the\nconventional DFT electronic structure once the correct vdW geometry is employed\nfor these physisorbed systems. Moreover, we show that a vdW correction scheme\nbased on a hybrid functional DFT calculation (HSE) results in an improved\ndescription of the highest occupied molecular level of the adsorbed molecules.\n", "  The behavior of a decoupled ideal Fermi gas in a homogeneously expanding\nthree-dimensional volume is investigated, starting from an equilibrium\nspectrum. In case the gas is massless and/or completely degenerate, the\nspectrum of the gas can be described by an effective temperature and/or an\neffective chemical potential, both of which scale down with the volume\nexpansion. In contrast, the spectrum of a decoupled massive and non-degenerate\ngas can only be described by an effective temperature if there are strong\nenough self-interactions such as to maintain an equilibrium distribution.\nAssuming perpetual equilibration, we study a decoupled gas which is\nrelativistic at decoupling and then is red-shifted until it becomes\nnon-relativistic. We find expressions for the effective temperature and\neffective chemical potential which allow us to calculate the final spectrum for\narbitrary initial conditions. This calculation is enabled by a new expansion of\nthe Fermi-Dirac integral, which is for our purpose superior to the well-known\nSommerfeld expansion. We also compute the behavior of the phase space density\nunder expansion and compare it to the case of real temperature and real\nchemical potential. Using our results for the degenerate case, we also obtain\nthe mean relic velocity of the recently proposed non-thermal cosmic neutrino\nbackground.\n", "  Using Monte Carlo simulations, we study thermal and critical properties of\ntwo systems, in which domain walls and so-called $Z_2$-vortices as topological\ndefects are presented. The main model is a lattice version of the $O(3)$\nprincipal chiral model. We find a first order transition and give qualitative\narguments that the first order is induced by topological defects. We also\nconsider the model of frustrated antiferromagnet on a square lattice with the\nadditional exchange interaction between spins of the third range order. This\nmodel belongs to the same symmetry class. In this model, a transition is of\nfirst order too.\n", "  We explore the structure of the spin foam-like vertex expansion in loop\nquantum cosmology and discuss properties of the corresponding amplitudes, with\nthe aim of elucidating some of the expansion's useful properties and features.\nWe find that the expansion is best suited for consideration of conceptual\nquestions and for investigating short-time, highly quantum behavior. In order\nto study dynamics at cosmological scales, the expansion must be carried to very\nhigh order, limiting its direct utility as a calculational tool for such\nquestions. Conversely, it is unclear that the expansion can be truncated at\nfinite order in a controlled manner.\n", "  The general procedure underlying Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional theory calculations consists in optimizing orbitals for a\nself-consistent solution of the Roothaan-Hall equations in an iterative\nprocess. It is often ignored that multiple self-consistent solutions can exist,\nseveral of which may correspond to minima of the energy functional. In addition\nto the difficulty sometimes encountered to converge the calculation to a\nself-consistent solution, one must ensure that the correct self-consistent\nsolution was found, typically the one with the lowest electronic energy.\nConvergence to an unwanted solution is in general not trivial to detect and\nwill deliver incorrect energy and molecular properties, and accordingly a\nmisleading description of chemical reactivity. Wrong conclusions based on\nincorrect self-consistent field convergence are particularly cumbersome in\nautomated calculations met in high-throughput virtual screening, structure\noptimizations, ab initio molecular dynamics, and in real-time explorations of\nchemical reactivity, where the vast amount of data can hardly be manually\ninspected. Here, we introduce a fast and automated approach to detect and cure\nincorrect orbital convergence, which is especially suited for electronic\nstructure calculations on sequences of molecular structures. Our approach\nconsists of a randomized perturbation of the converged electron density\n(matrix) intended to push orbital convergence to solutions that correspond to\nanother stationary point (of potentially lower electronic energy) in the\nvariational parameter space of an electronic wave function approximation.\n", "  Cosmological phase transitions can be a source of Stochastic Gravitational\nWave (SGW) background. Apart from the dynamics of the phase transition, the\ncharacteristic frequency and the fractional energy density $\\Omega_{\\rm gw}$ of\nthe SGW depends upon the temperature of the transition. In this article, we\ncompute the SGW spectrum in the light of QCD equation of state provided by the\nlattice results. We find that the inclusion of trace anomaly from lattice QCD,\nenhances the SGW signal generated during QCD phase transition by $\\sim 50\\%$\nand the peak frequency of the QCD era SGW are shifted higher by $\\sim 25\\%$ as\ncompared to the earlier estimates without trace anomaly. This result is\nextremely significant for testing the phase transition dynamics near QCD epoch.\n", "  We report on the nature of flow events for the gravity-driven discharge of\nglass beads through a hole that is small enough that the hopper is susceptible\nto clogging. In particular, we measure the average and standard deviation of\nthe distribution of discharged masses as a function of both hole and grain\nsizes. We do so in air, which is usual, but also with the system entirely\nsubmerged under water. This damps the grain dynamics and could be expected to\ndramatically affect the distribution of the flow events, which are described in\nprior work as avalanche-like. Though the flow is slower and the events last\nlonger, we find that the average discharge mass is only slightly reduced for\nsubmerged grains. Furthermore, we find that the shape of the distribution\nremains exponential, implying that clogging is still a Poisson process even for\nimmersed grains. Per Thomas and Durian [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 178001 (2015]),\nthis allows interpretation of the average discharge mass in terms of the\nfraction of flow microstates that precede, i.e. that effectively cause, a\nstable clog to form. Since this fraction is barely altered by water, we\nconclude that the crucial microscopic variables are the grain positions; grain\nmomenta play only a secondary role in destabilizing weak incipient arches.\nThese insights should aid on-going efforts to understand the susceptibility of\ngranular hoppers to clogging.\n", "  We present a hundred-watt-level linearly-polarized random fiber laser (RFL)\npumped by incoherent broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source and\nprospect the power scaling potential theoretically. The RFL employs half-opened\ncavity structure which is composed by a section of 330 m polarization\nmaintained (PM) passive fiber and two PM high reflectivity fiber Bragg\ngratings. The 2nd order Stokes light centered at 1178 nm reaches the pump\nlimited maximal power of 100.7 W with a full width at half-maximum linewidth of\n2.58 nm and polarization extinction ratio of 23.5 dB. The corresponding\nultimate quantum efficiency of pump to 2nd order Stokes light is 89.01%. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of linearly-polarized\nhigh-order RFL with hundred-watt output power. Furthermore, the theoretical\ninvestigation indicates that 300 W-level linearly-polarized single-mode 1st\norder Stokes light can be obtained from incoherently pumped RFL with 100 m PM\npassive fiber.\n", "  We formulate the theory of shortcuts to adiabaticity in classical mechanics.\nFor a reference Hamiltonian, the counterdiabatic term is constructed from the\ndispersionless Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy. Then the adiabatic theorem\nholds exactly for an arbitrary choice of time-dependent parameters. We use the\nHamilton-Jacobi theory to define the generalized action. The action is\nindependent of the history of the parameters and is directly related to the\nadiabatic invariant. The dispersionless KdV hierarchy is obtained from the\nclassical limit of the KdV hierarchy for the quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity.\nThis correspondence suggests some relation between the quantum and classical\nadiabatic theorems.\n", "  Classical novae show a rapid rise in optical brightness over a few hours.\nUntil recently the rise phase, particularly the phenomenon of a pre-maximum\nhalt, was observed sporadically. Solar observation satellites observing Coronal\nMass Ejections enable us to observe the pre-maximum phase in unprecedented\ntemporal resolution. We present observations of V5589 Sgr with STEREO HI-1B at\na cadence of 40 min, the highest to date. We temporally resolve a pre-maximum\nhalt for the first time, with two examples each rising over 40 min then\ndeclining within 80 min. Comparison with a grid of outburst models suggests\nthis double peak, and the overall rise timescale, are consistent with a white\ndwarf mass, central temperature and accretion rate close to 1.0 solar mass,\n5x10^7 K and 10^-10 solar masses per year respectively. The modelling formally\npredicts mass loss onset at JD 2456038.2391+/-0.0139, 12 hrs before optical\nmaximum. The model assumes a main-sequence donor. Observational evidence is for\na subgiant companion; meaning the accretion rate is under-estimated.\nPost-maximum we see erratic variations commonly associated with much slower\nnovae. Estimating the decline rate difficult, but we place the time to decline\ntwo magnitudes as 2.1 < t_2(days) < 3.9 making V5589 Sgr a \"very fast\" nova.\nThe brightest point defines \"day 0\" as JD 2456038.8224+/-0.0139, although at\nthis high cadence the meaning of the observed maximum becomes difficult to\ndefine. We suggest that such erratic variability normally goes undetected in\nfaster novae due to the low cadence of typical observations; implying erratic\nbehaviour is not necessarily related to the rate of decline.\n", "  The aim of the present work is the unification of incompatible elasticity\ntheory of dislocations and Eshelbian mechanics leading naturally to Eshelbian\ndislocation mechanics. In such a unified framework, we explore the utility of\nthe $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals. We give the physical interpretation of the\n$M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocations, connecting them with established\nquantities in dislocation theory such as the interaction energy and the\n$J$-integral of dislocations, which is equivalent to the well-known\nPeach-Koehler force. The $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocations have\nbeen studied in the framework of three-dimensional, incompatible, linear\nelasticity. First of all, the general formulas of the $J$-, $M$-, and\n$L$-integrals for dislocations are given. Next, the examined integrals are\nspecified for straight dislocations. Finally, the explicit formulas of the\n$J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals are calculated for straight (screw and edge)\ndislocations in isotropic materials. The obtained results reveal the physical\ninterpretation and significance of the $M$-, and $L$-integrals for straight\ndislocations. The $M$-integral between two straight dislocations (per unit\ndislocation length) is equal to the half of the interaction energy of the two\ndislocations (per unit dislocation length) depending on the distance and on the\nangle, plus twice the corresponding pre-logarithmic energy factor. The\n$L_3$-integral between two straight dislocations is the $z$-component of the\nconfigurational vector moment or the rotational moment about the $z$-axis\ncaused by the interaction between the two dislocations. Fundamental relations\nbetween the $J$-, $M$-, and $L_3$-integrals are derived showing the inherent\nconnection between them. The relations connecting directly the $J$-, $M$-, and\n$L_3$-integrals with the interaction energy are obtained.\n", "  We study the superconducting properties of population-imbalanced ultracold\nFermi mixtures in one-dimensional (1D) optical lattices that can be effectively\ndescribed by the spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard model (AHM) in the presence\nof a Zeeman magnetic field. We use the mean-field theory approach to obtain the\nground state phase diagrams including some unconventional superconducting\nphases such as the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, and the\n$\\eta$ phase (an extremal case of the FFLO phase), both for the case of a fixed\nchemical potential and for a fixed number of particles. It allows to determine\noptimal regimes for the FFLO phase as well as $\\eta$-pairing stability. We also\ninvestigate the evolution from the weak coupling (BCS-like limit) to the strong\ncoupling limit of tightly bound local pairs (BEC) with increasing attraction,\nat $T=0$. Finally, the obtained results show that despite of the occurrence of\nthe Lifshitz transition induced by an external magnetic field, the\nsuperconducting state can still exist in the system, at higher magnetic field\nvalues.\n", "  We address the important question of whether the newly discovered exoplanet,\nProxima Centauri b (PCb), is capable of retaining an atmosphere over long\nperiods of time. This is done by adapting a sophisticated multi-species MHD\nmodel originally developed for Venus and Mars, and computing the ion escape\nlosses from PCb. The results suggest that the ion escape rates are about two\norders of magnitude higher than the terrestrial planets of our Solar system if\nPCb is unmagnetized. In contrast, if the planet does have an intrinsic dipole\nmagnetic field, the rates are lowered for certain values of the stellar wind\ndynamic pressure, but they are still higher than the observed values for our\nSolar system's terrestrial planets. These results must be interpreted with due\ncaution, since most of the relevant parameters for PCb remain partly or wholly\nunknown.\n", "  The boundary integral equation method ascertains explicit relations between\nlocalized surface phonon and plasmon polariton resonances and the eigenvalues\nof its associated electrostatic operator. We show that group-theoretical\nanalysis of Laplace equation can be used to calculate the full set of\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the electrostatic operator for shapes and\nshells described by separable coordinate systems. These results not only unify\nand generalize many existing studies but also offer the opportunity to expand\nthe study of phenomena like cloaking by anomalous localized resonance. For that\nreason we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of elliptic and circular\ncylinders. We illustrate the benefits of using the boundary integral equation\nmethod to interpret recent experiments involving localized surface phonon\npolariton resonances and the size scaling of plasmon resonances in graphene\nnano-disks. Finally, symmetry-based operator analysis can be extended from\nelectrostatic to full-wave regime. Thus, bound states of light in the continuum\ncan be studied for shapes beyond spherical configurations.\n", "  The interaction of anisotropic point defects in anisotropic media is studied\nin the framework of anisotropic elasticity with eigendistortion. For this\npurpose key-equations and their solutions for anisotropic point defects in an\nanisotropic medium based on the anisotropic Green tensor are derived. The\nmaterial force, interaction energy and torque between two point defects as well\nas between a point defect and a dislocation loop are given. We discuss\nso-called contact terms and point out similarities between elastic, electric,\nand magnetic dipoles. The plastic, the elastic and the total volume changes\ncaused by an anisotropic point defect in an anisotropic material and the\nrelated Eshelby factor are determined. Thereby, the Eshelby factor is given in\nterms of the Eshelby tensor.\n", "  A model of the generation of a magnetic field in a neutron star is developed,\nbased on an instability of the magnetic field caused by the electroweak\ninteraction between electrons and nucleons in nuclear matter. The rate of\nchange of the helicity of the electrons as they scatter on protons in the dense\nmatter of a neutron star is calculated with the help of methods of quantum\nfield theory. The influence of the electroweak interaction between electrons\nand background nucleons on the process of change of the helicity is examined. A\nkinetic equation is derived for the evolution of the chiral chemical potential.\nThe results obtained are used to describe the evolution of the magnetic field\nin magnetars.\n", "  Water radiolysis by low-energy carbon projectiles is studied by\nfirst-principles molecular dynamics. Carbon projectiles of kinetic energies\nbetween 175 eV and 2.8 keV are shot across liquid water. Apart from\ntranslational, rotational and vibrational excitation, they produce water\ndissociation. The most abundant products are H and OH fragments. We find that\nthe maximum spatial production of radiolysis products, not only occurs at low\nvelocities, but also well below the maximum of energy deposition, reaching one\nH every 5 Ang at the lowest speed studied (1 Bohr/fs), dissociative collisions\nbeing more significant at low velocity while the amount of energy required to\ndissociate water is constant and much smaller than the projectile's energy. A\nsubstantial fraction of the energy transferred to fragments, especially for\nhigh velocity projectiles, is in the form of kinetic energy, such fragments\nbecoming secondary projectiles themselves. High velocity projectiles give rise\nto well-defined binary collisions, which should be amenable to binary\napproximations. This is not the case for lower velocities, where multiple\ncollision events are observed. H secondary projectiles tend to move as radicals\nat high velocity, as cations when slower. We observe the generation of new\nspecies such as hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. The former occurs when an O\nradical created in the collision process attacks a water molecule at the O\nsite. The latter when the C projectile is completely stopped and reacts with\ntwo water molecules.\n", "  We study the indentation of ultrathin elastic sheets clamped to the edge of a\ncircular hole. This classical setup has received considerable attention lately,\nbeing used by various experimental groups as a probe to measure the surface\nproperties and stretching modulus of thin solid films. Despite the apparent\nsimplicity of this method, the geometric nonlinearity inherent in the\nmechanical response of thin solid objects renders the analysis of the resulting\ndata a nontrivial task. Importantly, the essence of this difficulty is in the\ngeometric coupling between in-plane stress and out-of-plane deformations, and\nhence is present in the behaviour of Hookean solids even when the slope of the\ndeformed membrane remains small. Here we take a systematic approach to address\nthis problem, using the membrane limit of the F\\\"{o}ppl-von-K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n\nequations. This approach highlights some of the dangers in the use of\napproximate formulae in the metrology of solid films, which can introduce large\nerrors; we suggest how such errors may be avoided in performing experiments and\nanalyzing the resulting data.\n", "  A modern notion of integrability is that of multidimensional consistency\n(MDC), which classically implies the coexistence of (commuting) dynamical flows\nin several independent variables for one and the same dependent variable. This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the\ndiscrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be\nviewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of\nsuch equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of\nLagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar\nfunctions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of\nindependent variables. The variational principle involves variations not only\nwith respect to the field variables, but also with respect to the geometry in\nthe space of independent variables. In this paper we consider a quantum\nanalogue of this new variational principle by means of quantum propagators (or\nequivalently Feynman path integrals). In the case of quadratic Lagrangians\nthese can be evaluated in terms of Gaussian integrals. We study also periodic\nreductions of the lattice leading to discrete multi-time dynamical commuting\nmappings, the simplest example of which is the discrete harmonic oscillator,\nwhich surprisingly reveals a rich integrable structure behind it. On the basis\nof this study we propose a new quantum variational principle in terms of\nmultiform path integrals.\n", "  This is the first quantitative analysis of mechanical reliability of\nall-solid state batteries. Mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte (SE)\nis caused by intercalation-induced expansion of the electrode particles, within\nthe constrain of a dense microstructure. A coupled electro-chemo-mechanical\nmodel was implemented to quantify the material properties that cause a SE to\nfracture. The treatment of microstructural details is essential to the\nunderstanding of stress-localization phenomena and fracture. A cohesive zone\nmodel is employed to simulate the evolution of damage. In the numerical tests,\nfracture is prevented only if electrode-particle's expansion is lower than 7.5%\nand the solid-electrolyte's fracture energy higher than $G_c = 4$ J m$^{-2}$.\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, the analyses show that compliant solid\nelectrolytes (with Young's modulus in the order of E$_{SE} = 15$ GPa) are more\nprone to micro-cracking. This result, captured by our non-linear kinematics\nmodel, contradicts the speculations that sulfide SEs are more suitable for the\ndesign of bulk-type batteries than oxide SEs. Mechanical degradation is linked\nto the battery power-density. Fracture in solid Li-ion conductors represents a\nbarrier for Li transport, and accelerates the decay of rate performance.\n", "  In this paper, by proposing a generalized $specific~volume$, we restudy the\n$P-V$ criticality of charged AdS black holes in the extended phase space. The\nresults show that most of the previous conclusions can be generalized without\nchange, but the ratio $\\tilde{\\rho}_c$ should be $3 \\tilde{\\alpha}/16$ in\ngeneral case. Further research on the thermodynamical phase transition of black\nhole leads us to a natural interpretation of our assumption, and more black\nhole properties can be generalized. Finally, we study the number density for\ncharged AdS black hole in higher dimensions, the results show the necessity of\nour assumption.\n", "  The electrical and chemical properties of carbon nanotubes vary significantly\nwith different chirality and diameter, making the experimental determination of\nthese structural properties important. Here, we show that the vibrational\ndensity of states (VDOS) contains information on the structure of carbon\nnanotubes, particularly at low frequencies. We show that the diameter and\nchirality of the nanotubes can be determined from the characteristic low\nfrequency $L$ and $L'$ modes in the VDOS. For zigzag nanotubes, the $L$ peak\nsplits into two peaks giving rise to another low energy $L\"$ peak. The\nsignificant changes in the frequencies and relative intensities of these peaks\nopen up a route to distinguish among structurally different nanotubes. A close\nstudy of different orientations of Stone-Wales defects with varying defect\ndensity reveals that different structural defects also leave distinct\nfingerprints in the VDOS, particularly in the $L$ and $L'$ modes. With our\nresults, more structural information can be obtained from experiments which can\ndirectly measure the VDOS, such as inelastic electron and inelastic neutron\nspectroscopy.\n", "  With a Yang-Mills flux-tube initial state and a high resolution (3+1)D\nParticle-in-Cell Relativistic (PICR) hydrodynamics simulation, we calculate the\n$\\Lambda$ polarization for different energies. The origination of polarization\nin high energy collisions is discussed, and we find linear impact parameter\ndependence of the global $\\Lambda$ polarization. Furthermore, the global\n$\\Lambda$ polarization in our model decreases very fast in the low energy\ndomain, and the decline curve fits well the recent results of Beam Energy Scan\n(BES) program launched by the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC). The time evolution of polarization is also discussed.\n", "  As a space-borne detector POLAR is designed to conduct hard X-ray\npolarization measurements of gamma-ray bursts on the statistically significant\nsample of events and with an unprecedented accuracy. During its development\nphase a number of tests, calibrations runs and verification measurements were\ncarried out in order to validate instrument functionality and optimize\noperational parameters. In this article we present results on gain optimization\ntogeter with verification data obtained in the course of broad laboratory and\nenvironmental tests. In particular we focus on exposures to the $^{137}$Cs\nradioactive source and determination of the gain dependence on the high voltage\nfor all 1600 detection channels of the polarimeter. Performance of the\ninstrument is described in detail with respect to the dynamic range, energy\nresolution and temperature dependence. Gain optimization algorithms and\nresponse non-uniformity studies are also broadly discussed. Results presented\nbelow constitute important parts for development of the POLAR calibration and\noperation database.\n", "  We present terahertz quantum cascade lasers operating at a defect mode of a\nphotonic crystal bandgap. This class of devices exhibits single mode emission\nand low threshold current compared to standard metal-metal lasers. The mode\nselectivity is an intrinsic property of the chosen fabrication design. The\nlower lasing threshold effect, already reported in photonic crystal quantum\ncascade lasers, is further enhanced in the ultra-flat-dispersion defect line.\nThe presented results pave the way for integrated circuitry operating in the\nterahertz regime and have important applications in the field of quantum\ncascade lasers, spectroscopy and microcavity lasers.\n", "  Engineered lattices in condensed matter physics, such as cold atom optical\nlattices or photonic crystals, can have fundamentally different properties from\nnaturally-occurring electronic crystals. Here, we report a novel type of\nartificial quantum matter lattice. Our lattice is a multilayer heterostructure\nbuilt from alternating thin films of topological and trivial insulators. Each\ninterface within the heterostructure hosts a set of topologically-protected\ninterface states, and by making the layers sufficiently thin, we demonstrate\nfor the first time a hybridization of interface states across layers. In this\nway, our heterostructure forms an emergent atomic chain, where the interfaces\nact as lattice sites and the interface states act as atomic orbitals, as seen\nfrom our measurements by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). By\nchanging the composition of the heterostructure, we can directly control\nhopping between lattice sites. We realize a topological and a trivial phase in\nour superlattice band structure. We argue that the superlattice may be\ncharacterized in a significant way by a one-dimensional topological invariant,\nclosely related to the invariant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our\ntopological insulator heterostructure demonstrates a novel experimental\nplatform where we can engineer band structures by directly controlling how\nelectrons hop between lattice sites.\n", "  In the context of a star cluster moving on a circular galactic orbit, a\n\"potential escaper\" is a cluster star that has orbital energy greater than the\nescape energy, and yet is confined within the Jacobi radius of the stellar\nsystem. On the other hand analytic models of stellar clusters typically have a\ntruncation energy equal to the cluster escape energy, and therefore explicitly\nexclude these energetically unbound stars. Starting from the landmark analysis\nperformed by Henon of periodic orbits of the circular Hill equations, we\npresent a numerical exploration of the population of \"non-escapers\", defined\nhere as those stars which remain within two Jacobi radii for several galactic\nperiods, with energy above the escape energy. We show that they can be\ncharacterised by the Jacobi integral and two further approximate integrals,\nwhich are based on perturbation theory and ideas drawn from Lidov-Kozai theory.\nFinally we use these results to construct an approximate analytic model that\nincludes a phase space description of a population resembling that of potential\nescapers, in addition to the usual bound population.\n", "  Let $\\Omega_\\epsilon$ be a metallic plate whose top inaccessible surface has\nbeen damaged by some chemical or mechanical agent. We heat the opposite side\nand collect a sequence of temperature maps $u^\\epsilon$. Here, we construct a\nformal explicit approximation of the damage $\\epsilon\\theta$ by solving a\nnonlinear inverse problem for the heat equation in three steps: (i) smoothing\nof temperature maps, (ii) domain derivative of the temperature, (iii) thin\nplate approximation of the model and perturbation theory.\n  Our inversion formula is tested with realistic synthetic data and used in a\nreal laboratory experiment.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a multidimensional generalization of Kitagawa's\nsplit-step discrete-time quantum walk, study the spectrum of its evolution\noperator for the case of one defect coins, and prove localization of the walk.\nUsing a spectral mapping theorem, we can reduce the spectral analysis of the\nevolution operator to that of a discrete Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator with variable\ncoefficients, which is analyzed using the Feshbach map.\n", "  We derive the equations to calculate the reduced width amplitudes (RWA) of\nthe different size clusters and deformed clusters without any approximation.\nThese equations named Laplace expansion method are applicable to the nuclear\nmodels which uses the Gaussian wave packets. The advantage of the method is\ndemonstrated by the numerical calculations of the ${}^{16}{\\rm O}+\\alpha$ and\n${}^{24}{\\rm Mg}+\\alpha$ RWAs in $^{20}{\\rm Ne}$ and $^{28}{\\rm Si}$.\n", "  An experimental investigation on the periodic and chaotic oscillations in a\nreflex plasma source in presence of magnetic field is presented. The experiment\nis conducted in a reflex plasma source, consisting of two cathodes and a ring\nanode. A penning type DC glow discharge in an uniform axial magnetic field is\ninitiated in the background of argon gas. The current-voltage characteristics\nnear the breakdown voltage show a hysteresis with two distinct discharge\ncurrent regimes. The effect of magnetic field on the discharge current and\nfloating potential oscillations is studied when the discharge is operated\nwithin this hysteresis loop. At a typical axial magnetic field, the discharge\ntransits from high discharge current regime (beyond 4-5 mA), an oscillation\nfree regime, to a low discharge current regime (less than 1 mA). Depending upon\nthe discharge parameters, low discharge current regime shows either the\nperiodic or chaotic oscillation in the frequency range of 1-50 KHz. The\nfrequency of periodic oscillation increases with the increase in magnetic field\nup to 90 Gauss and with further increase in magnetic field, the periodic\noscillation becomes chaotic in nature.\n", "  The d'Alembertian $\\Box\\phi=0$ has solution $\\phi=f(v)/r$, where $f$ is a\nfunction of a null coordinate $v$, and this allows creation of a divergent\nsingularity out of nothing. In scalar-Einstein theory a similar situation\narises both for the scalar field and also for curvature invariants such as the\nRicci scalar. Here what happens in canonical quantum gravity is investigated.\nTwo minispace Hamiltonian systems are set up: extrapolation and approximation\nof these indicates that the quantum mechanical wavefunction can be finite at\nthe origin.\n", "  In the preprint arxiv:1703.03425 \"strong evidence\" for the normal neutrino\nmass ordering is claimed. The authors obtain Bayesian odds of 42:1 in favour of\nthe normal ordering. Their conclusion is based on adopting a flat logarithmic\nprior for the three neutrino masses. Such an assumption favours a hierarchical\nspectrum for the masses, which is much easier to accommodate for the normal\nmass ordering, and hence their prior assumption makes the inverted ordering\nmuch less likely a priori. We argue that the claimed \"evidence\" for normal\nordering is almost entirely driven by the adopted prior and not due to the data\nitself.\n", "  In this paper the conditions are investigated for the occurrence of the\nso-called macroscopic irreversibility property and the related phenomenon of\ndecay to kinetic equilibrium which may characterize the $1-$body probability\ndensity function (PDF) associated with hard-sphere systems. The problem is set\nin the framework of the axiomatic \"ab initio\" approach to classical statistical\nmechanics recently developed [Tessarotto \\textit{et al}., 2013-2017] and the\nrelated establishment of an exact kinetic equation realized by Master equation\nfor the same kinetic PDF. As shown in the paper the task involves the\nintroduction of a suitable functional of the $1-$body PDF here identified with\nthe \\textit{Master kinetic information}. The goal is to show that, provided the\nsame PDF is realized in terms of an arbitrary suitably-smooth particular\nsolution of the Master kinetic equation the two properties indicated above are\nindeed realized and that the same functional is unrelated either with the\nBoltzmann-Shannon entropy and the Fisher information.\n", "  We demonstrate that in the framework of standard general relativity\npolytropic spheres with properly fixed polytropic index $n$ and relativistic\nparameter $\\sigma$, giving ratio of the central pressure $p_\\mathrm{c}$ to the\ncentral energy density $\\rho_\\mathrm{c}$, can contain region of trapped null\ngeodesics. Such trapping polytropes can exist for $n > 2.138$ and they are\ngenerally much more extended and massive than the observed neutron stars. We\nshow that in the $n$--$\\sigma$ parameter space the region of allowed trapping\nincrease with polytropic index for interval of physical interest $2.138 < n <\n4$. Space extension of the region of trapped null geodesics increases with both\nincreasing $n$ and $\\sigma > 0.677$ from the allowed region. In order to relate\nthe trapping phenomenon to astrophysically relevant situations, we restrict\nvalidity of the polytropic configurations to their extension $r_\\mathrm{extr}$\ncorresponding to the gravitational mass $M \\sim 2M_{\\odot}$ of the most massive\nobserved neutron stars. Then for the central density $\\rho_\\mathrm{c} \\sim\n10^{15}$~g\\,cm$^{-3}$ the trapped regions are outside $r_\\mathrm{extr}$ for all\nvalues of $2.138 < n < 4$, for the central density $\\rho_\\mathrm{c} \\sim 5\n\\times 10^{15}$~g\\,cm$^{-3}$ the whole trapped regions are located inside of\n$r_\\mathrm{extr}$ for $2.138 < n < 3.1$, while for $\\rho_\\mathrm{c} \\sim\n10^{16}$~g\\,cm$^{-3}$ the whole trapped regions are inside of $r_\\mathrm{extr}$\nfor all values of $2.138 < n < 4$, guaranteeing astrophysically plausible\ntrapping for all considered polytropes. The region of trapped null geodesics is\nlocated closely to the polytrope centre and could have relevant influence on\ncooling of such polytropes or for binding of gravitational waves in their\ninterior.\n", "  Gravitational waves are a potential direct probe for the multi-dimensional\nflow during the first second of core-collapse supernova explosions. Here we\noutline the structure of the predicted gravitational wave signal from\nneutrino-driven supernovae of non-rotating progenitors from recent 2D and 3D\nsimulations. We sketch some quantitative dependencies that govern the\namplitudes of this signal and its evolution in the time-frequency domain.\n", "  The nuclear collective models introduced by Bohr, Mottelson and Rainwater,\ntogether with the Mayer-Jensen shell model, have provided the central framework\nfor the development of nuclear physics. This paper reviews the microscopic\nevolution of the collective models and their underlying foundations. In\nparticular, it is shown that the Bohr-Mottelson models have expressions as\nmacroscopic limits of microscopic models that have precisely-defined\nexpressions in many-nucleon quantum mechanics. Understanding collective models\nin this way is especially useful because it enables the analysis of nuclear\nproperties in terms of them to be revisited and reassessed in the light of\ntheir microscopic foundations.\n", "  Ranges of differentiated abstention are shown to reverse an \"exact\" poll\nestimate on voting day allowing the minority candidate to win the election. In\na two-candidate competition A and B with voting intentions at $I_a$,\n$I_b=1-I_a$ and respective turnout at $x$ and $y$, there exists a critical\nvalue $I_{ac}$ for which $I_{ac}<I_a<\\frac{1}{2}$ yields an actual election\noutcome $v_a>\\frac{1}{2}$. The reversal may occur without any change of\nindividual choices. Accordingly, for a set of turnouts $x$ and $y$ the minimum\nvoting intention $I_{ac}$ required for A to win the final vote can be\ncalculated. The various ranges of $x$ and $y$ for which $I_{Ac}$ is smaller\nthan the expected 50\\% barrier are determined. The calculations are applied to\nthe coming 2017 French presidential election for a second round scenario\ninvolving the National Front candidate Marine Le Pen against either the Right\ncandidate Fran\\c{c}ois Fillon or the Center candidate Emmanuel Macron. Several\nrealistic conditions are found to make Marine Le Pen win the election despite\nvoting intentions about only 40-45\\%.\n", "  Recent results have demonstrated an exceptionally high dielectric constant in\nthe range 200 K-330 K in a crystalline tianium oxide : Rb2Ti2O5. In this\narticle, the possibility of a structural transition giving rise to\nferroelectricity is carefully inspected. In particular X-Ray diffraction, high\nresolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are\nperformed. The crystal structure is shown to remain invariant and\ncentrosymmetric at all temperatures between 90 K and 450 K. The stability of\nthe C2/m structure is confirmed by DFT calculations. These important findings\nallow to discard the existence of a conventional ferroelectric phase transition\nas a possible mechanism for the unusual dielectric constant observed in this\nmaterial.\n", "  We report observations of magnetoresistance, quantum oscillations and\nangle-resolved photoemission in RhSb$_3$, a unfilled skutterudite semimetal\nwith low carrier density. The calculated electronic band structure of RhSb$_3$\nentails a $Z_2$ quantum number $\\nu_0=0,\\nu_1=\\nu_2=\\nu_3=1$ in analogy to\nstrong topological insulators, and inverted linear valence/conduction bands\nthat touch at discrete points close to the Fermi level, in agreement with\nangle-resolved photoemission results. Transport experiments reveal an\nunsaturated linear magnetoresistance that approaches a factor of 200 at 60 T\nmagnetic fields, and quantum oscillations observable up to 150~K that are\nconsistent with a large Fermi velocity ($\\sim 1.3\\times 10^6$ ms$^{-1}$), high\ncarrier mobility ($\\sim 14$ $m^2$/Vs), and small three dimensional hole pockets\nwith nontrivial Berry phase. A very small, sample-dependent effective mass that\nfalls as low as $0.015(7)$ bare masses scales with Fermi velocity, suggesting\nRhSb$_3$ is a new class of zero-gap three-dimensional Dirac semimetal.\n", "  Although electrons and photons produce the same interference patterns in the\ntwo-slit experiments, the description of these patters is markedly different.\nThis difference was analyzed by Bohm. Later on Sanz and Miret-Artes and others\nwere able to squeeze the differences to zero. Fortunately, they left some room\nfor developments presented in this Letter. We noticed that in the absence of\nsources the electromagnetic field can be represented by the complex scalar\nfield. It is demonstrated that the same fields are being used in the non\nrelativistic Schr\\\"odinger equation. The connection between the electromagnetic\nand Schr\\\"odinger fields allows to study the topology of zero sets (Chladni\npatterns) of Schr\\\"odinger eigenfunctions. The existence of these patterns is\ncontingent upon the existence of eigenvalues of multiplicity higher than one.\nThis is permissible only in Schr\\\"odinger's version of quantum mechanics.\nPresence of multiplicities is making quantum mechanical and topological\nentanglements equivalent.\n", "  During the next decade, Chile will consolidate its place as the 'World\nCapital of Astronomy'. By 2025, more than 70% of the world's infrastructure for\nconducting professional astronomical observations will be installed in the\nAtacama Desert in the north of the country. The amazing scientific discoveries\nthese telescopes produce have a direct impact on our understanding of the\ncosmos, and protecting this 'window to the universe' is fundamental in order to\nensure humanity's right to contemplate the night sky and decipher our origins.\nAs a country, Chile faces the challenge of fighting light pollution and\nprotecting its dark skies in a context of sprawling urban growth and an\never-expanding mining industry that shares the same territory with astronomical\nobservatories.\n  The Chilean Astronomical Society (Sociedad Chilena de Astronomia, SOCHIAS)\nplays an active role in protecting dark skies through a series of initiatives\ninvolving educational programmes, aiding in the development and enforcement of\npublic policy and regulation, and seeking the declaration of Chile's best\nastronomical sites as protected heritage areas, both at the national and\ninternational levels. Whilst describing our experiences, I highlight the\nimportance of approaching the problem of light pollution from all sides,\ninvolving all the relevant actors (communities, national and local governments,\nlighting industry, environmentalists, astronomers and others). I also discuss\nhow communication and timely coordination with potential problematic actors\n(like industries, cities and some government agencies) can be an effective tool\nto transform potential enemies into allies in the fight for the protection of\nthe night sky.\n", "  While the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is a uniquely\npowerful telescope, its impact in certain fields of astrophysics has been\nlimited by observatory policies rather than the telescope's innate technical\ncapabilities. In particular, several observatory policies present challenges\nfor observations of variable, mobile, and/or transient sources --- collectively\nreferred to here as \"time-domain\" observations. In this whitepaper we identify\nsome of these policies, describe the scientific applications they impair, and\nsuggest changes that would increase ALMA's science impact in Cycle 6 and\nbeyond.\n  Parties interested in time-domain science with ALMA are encouraged to join\nthe ALMA Time-domain Special Interest Group (ATSIG) by signing up for the ATSIG\nmailing list at https://groups.google.com/group/alma-td-sig .\n", "  We describe v02 of igmspec, a database of publically available ultraviolet,\noptical, and near-infrared spectra that probe the intergalactic medium (IGM).\nThis database, a child of the specdb repository in the specdb github\norganization, comprises 403277 unique sources and 434686 spectra obtained with\nthe world's greatest observatories. All of these data are distributed in a\nsingle ~25 GB HDF5 file maintained at the University of California\nObservatories and the University of California, Santa Cruz. The specdb software\npackage includes Python scripts and modules for searching the source catalog\nand spectral datasets, and software links to the linetools package for spectral\nanalysis. The repository also includes software to generate private spectral\ndatasets that are compliant with International Virtual Observatory Alliance\n(IVOA) protocols and a Python-based interface for IVOA Simple Spectral Access\nqueries. Future versions of igmspec will ingest other sources (e.g. gamma-ray\nburst afterglows) and other surveys as they become publicly available. The\noverall goal is to include every spectrum that effectively probes the IGM.\nFuture databases of specdb may include publicly available galaxy spectra\n(exgalspec) and published supernovae spectra (snspec). The community is\nencouraged to join the effort on github: https://github.com/specdb\n", "  The objective of this work is to study time-minimum and energy-minimum global\noptimal control for dissipative open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed\nby the Lindblad equation. The controls appear only in the Hamiltonian.\n  Using recent results regarding the decoupling of such dissipative dynamics\ninto intra- and inter-unitary orbits, we transform the control system into a\nbi-linear control system on the Bloch ball (the unitary sphere together with\nits interior). We then design a numerical algorithm to construct an optimal\npath to achieve a desired point given initial states close to the origin (the\nsingular point) of the Bloch ball. This is done both for the minimum-time and\nminimum -energy control problems.\n", "  We report a combined theoretical/experimental study of dynamic screening of\nexcitons in media with frequency-dependent dielectric functions. We develop an\nanalytical model showing that interparticle interactions in an exciton are\nscreened in the range of frequencies from zero to the characteristic binding\nenergy depending on the symmetries and transition energies of that exciton. The\nproblem of the dynamic screening is then reduced to simply solving the\nSchrodinger equation with an effectively frequency-independent potential.\nQuantitative predictions of the model are experimentally verified using a test\nsystem: neutral, charged and defect-bound excitons in two-dimensional monolayer\nWS2, screened by metallic, liquid, and semiconducting environments. The\nscreening-induced shifts of the excitonic peaks in photoluminescence spectra\nare in good agreement with our model.\n", "  Using hundreds of XMM-Newton and Chandra archival observations and nearly a\nthousand RXTE observations, we have generated a comprehensive library of the\nknown pulsars in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC). The pulsars\nare detected multiple times across the full parameter spaces of X-ray\nluminosity ($L_X= 10^{31-38}$~erg/s) and spin period ( P$<$1s -- P$>$1000s) and\nthe library enables time-domain studies at a range of energy scales. The high\ntime-resolution and sensitivity of the EPIC cameras are complemented by the\nangular resolution of Chandra and the regular monitoring of RXTE. Our\nprocessing %$\\sim$15 year pipeline uses the latest calibration files and\nsoftware to generate a suite of useful products for each pulsar detection:\nevent lists, high time-resolution light curves, periodograms, spectra, and\ncomplete histories of $\\dot{P}$, the pulsed fraction, etc., in the broad\n(0.2-12 keV), soft (0.2-2 keV), and hard (2-12 keV) energy bands. After\ncombining the observations from these telescopes, we found that 28 pulsars show\nlong-term spin up and 25 long-term spin down. We also used the faintest and\nbrightest sources to map out the lower and upper boundaries of\naccretion-powered X-ray emission: the propeller line and the Eddington line,\nrespectively. We are in the process of comparing the observed pulse profiles to\ngeometric models of X-ray emission in order to constrain the physical\nparameters of the pulsars. Finally we are preparing a public release of the\nlibrary so that it can be used by others in the astronomical community.\n", "  The existence, stability, and dynamics of bound pairs of symbiotic matter\nwaves in the form of dark-bright soliton pairs in two-component mixtures of\natomic Bose-Einstein condensates is investigated. Motivated by the tunability\nof the atomic interactions in recent experiments, we explore in detail the\nimpact that changes in the interaction strengths have on these bound pairs by\nconsidering significant deviations from the Manakov (integrable) limit. It is\nfound that dark-bright soliton pairs exist as stable configurations in a wide\nparametric window spanning both the miscible and the immiscible regime of\ninteractions. Outside this parameter interval two unstable regions are\nidentified and are associated with a supercritical and a subcritical pitchfork\nbifurcation, respectively. Dynamical manifestation of these instabilities gives\nrise to a redistribution of the bright density between the dark solitons, and\nalso to symmetry-broken stationary states that are mass imbalanced (asymmetric)\nwith respect to their bright soliton counterpart. The long-time dynamics of\nboth the stable and the unstable balanced and imbalanced dark-bright soliton\npairs is analyzed.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect is mainly used to probe the magnetization\norientation in ferromagnetic materials. A less explored aspect is the torque\nacting back on magnetization, an effect that can be important at high currents.\nThe spin-orbit coupling of the conduction electrons causes spin-up and\nspin-down electrons to scatter to opposite sides when a charge current flows in\nthe sample. This is equivalent to a spin current with orientation and flow\nperpendicular to the driving charge current, leading to a non-equilibrium spin\naccumulation that exerts a torque on the bulk magnetization through the s-d\nexchange interaction. The symmetry of this toque is that of an uniaxial\nanisotropy along the driving current. The large screening currents generated\nwith laser pulses in all-optical magnetic switching experiments make for\npractical uses of this torque.\n", "  Optomechanical crystals, purposely designed and fabricated semiconductor\nnanostructures, are used to enhance the coupling between the electromagnetic\nfield and the mechanical vibrations of matter at the nanoscale. However, in\nreal optomechanical crystals, imperfections open extra channels where the\ntransfer of energy is lost, reducing the optomechanical coupling eficiency.\nHere, we quantify the role of disorder in a paradigmatic one-dimensional\noptomechanical crystal with full phononic and photonic bandgaps. We show how\ndisorder can be exploited as a resource to enhance the optomechanical coupling\nbeyond engineered structures, thus providing a new toolset for optomechanics.\n", "  The control of electric currents in solids is at the origin of the modern\nelectronics revolution which has driven our daily life since the second half of\n20th century. Surprisingly, to date, there is no thermal analog for a control\nof heat flux. Here, we summarize the very last developments carried out in this\ndirection to control heat exchanges by radiation both in near and far-field in\ncomplex architecture networks.\n", "  Polarization measurements provide a detailed method to test the Standard\nModel and to search for new physics. Most previous studies depend on\npre-selected coordinates, which blurs the significance of the results. The\nconstruction of two rotation-invariant observables in vector boson decay into a\nfermion pair has been proved to be a big success. In this work, we show that\nthere are more rotation-invariant observables and provide a general recipe to\nfind all of them in an arbitrary decay process. Taking spin-1/2 and spin-1\nparticle decay processes as examples, we calculate the explicit expressions of\nall rotation-invariant observables, which can serve as a robust test of the\ndetector acceptance and help the analysis of experimental data.\n", "  We construct a variational wave function for the ground state of weakly\ninteracting bosons that gives a lower energy than the mean-field\nGirardeau-Arnowitt (or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov) theory. This improvement is\nbrought about by incorporating the dynamical 3/2-body processes where one of\ntwo colliding non-condensed particles drops into the condensate and vice versa.\nThe processes are also shown to transform the one-particle excitation spectrum\ninto a bubbling mode with a finite lifetime even in the long-wavelength limit.\nThese 3/2-body processes, which give rise to dynamical exchange of particles\nbetween the non-condensate reservoir and condensate absent in ideal gases, are\nidentified as a key mechanism for realizing and sustaining macroscopic\ncoherence in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  We prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem for the quantum spin Hall effect\n(QSHE) in two-dimensional $\\pi$-flux models. In the presence of time reversal,\n$U(1)$ charge conservation and magnetic translation (with $\\pi$-flux per unit\ncell) symmetries, if a generic interacting Hamiltonian has a unique gapped\nsymmetric ground state at half filling (i.e. an odd number of electrons per\nunit cell), it can only be a QSH insulator. In other words, a trivial Mott\ninsulator is forbidden by symmetries at half filling. We further show that such\na symmetry-enforced QSHE can be realized in cold atoms, by shaking an optical\nlattice and applying a time-dependent Zeeman field.\n", "  We study acoustic modes of a close-packed hexagonal lattice of spheres\nadhered to a substrate, propagating along a high-symmetry direction. The model,\naccounting for both normal and shear coupling between the spheres and between\nthe spheres and the substrate, yields three contact-based vibrational modes\ninvolving both translational and rotational motion of the spheres. Furthermore,\nwe study the effect of sphere-substrate and sphere-sphere contacts on\nspheroidal vibrational modes of the spheres within a perturbative approach. The\nsphere-substrate interaction results in a frequency upshift for the modes\nhaving a non-zero displacement at the contact point with the substrate.\nSphere-sphere interactions result in dispersion of spheroidal modes turning\nthem into propagating waves, albeit with a small group velocity. Analytical\ndispersion relations for both contact-based and spheroidal modes are presented\nand compared with results obtained for a square lattice.\n", "  This work verifies the instrumental characteristics of the CCD detector which\nis part of the UNI astronomical observatory. We measured the linearity of the\nCCD detector of the SBIG STXL6303E camera, along with the associated gain and\nreadout noise. The linear response to the incident light of the detector is\nextremely linear (R2 =99.99%), its effective gain is 1.65 +/- 0.01 e-/ADU and\nits readout noise is 12.2 e-. These values are in agreement with the\nmanufacturer. We confirm that this detector is extremely precise to make\nmeasurements for astronomical purposes.\n", "  An asymmetric resonant cavity can be used to form a path that is much longer\nthan the cavity size. We demonstrate this capability for a deformed microdisk\nequipped with two linear waveguides, by constructing a multiply reflected\nperiodic orbit that is confined by total internal reflection within the\ndeformed microdisk and outcoupled by the two linear waveguides. Resonant mode\nanalysis reveals that the modes corresponding to the periodic orbit are\ncharacterized by high quality factors. From measured spectral and far-field\ndata, we confirm that the fabricated devices can form a path about 9.3 times\nlonger than the average diameter of the deformed microdisk.\n", "  Existence of steady states in elastic media at small strains with diffusion\nof a solvent or fluid due to Fick's or Darcy's laws is proved by combining\nusage of variational methods inspired from static situations with Schauder's\nfixed-point arguments. In the plain variant, the problem consists in the force\nequilibrium coupled with the continuity equation, and the underlying operator\nis non-potential and non-pseudomonotone so that conventional methods are not\napplicable. In advanced variants, electrically-charged multi-component flows\nthrough an electrically charged elastic solid are treated, employing critical\npoints of the saddle-point type. Eventually, anisothermal variants involving\nheat-transfer equation are treated, too.\n", "  Ribbons are topological objects of biological and technological importance.\nHere, we study the folding of thick ribbons with hydrophobic surfaces in a bad\nsolvent in regimes in which either the ribbon's thickness or the solvent\nmolecule size is not vanishingly small compared to the ribbon's width.\nExtensive Monte Carlo simulations show that ribbons of various lengths and with\na small stiffness adopt several distinct configurations as the ground state\nthat include rolled (Archimedean spiral), curled, twisted and globule\nconformations. Analytic and numerical calculations based on the consideration\nof putative ground states lead to phase diagrams that qualitatively agree with\nthe simulation results. A symmetry breaking of the planar rolled configuration\nin favor of the elongated twisted and the globular ribbons is observed on\nincreasing the solvent size. Interestingly, the twisted ribbon is found as the\nground state in the absence of any energetic preference for twisting. We show\nthat the twist of the DNA double helix structure can be stabilized when modeled\nas a hydrophobic thick ribbon even in the limit of vanishing solvent size.\n", "  We study vacuum fluctuation properties of an ensemble of $SU(N)$ gauge theory\nconfigurations, in the limit of large number of colors, \\textit{viz.} $N_c\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, and explore statistical nature of the topological\nsusceptibility by analyzing its critical behavior at a nonzero vacuum parameter\n$\\theta$ and temperature $T$. We find that the system undergoes a vacuum phase\ntransition at the chiral symmetry restoration temperature as well as at an\nabsolute value of $\\theta$. On the other hand, the long range correlation\nlength solely depends on $\\theta$ for the theories having critical exponent\n$e=2$ or $T=T_d+1$, where $T_d$ is the decoherence temperature. Further, it is\nworth noticing that the unit critical exponent vacuum configuration corresponds\nto a noninteracting statistical basis pertaining to a constant mass of\n$\\eta^{\\prime}$.\n", "  Landauer principle states that erasure of $N$ bit information requires an\nentropic cost of $Nk_B \\ln 2$. This fact can easily be demonstrated by\nrelaxation of an ideal gas consisting of $N$ particles inside a fixed volume.\nIn this paper we discuss the modification of Landauer bound when we use\nnon-ideal gas with inter-particle interactions for erasure procedure. We have\nfound that the bound on the entropy production can be lowered when the\ninteraction between particles is square-well potential.\n", "  The electronic structure and optical absorption spectrum of V^{0} and V^{-}\ncenter in MgO are investigated using first-principles calculations based on\ndensity functional theory. It is demonstrated that the configuration with\ndistortion is energetically favorable in PBE0 functional. The six O atoms\naround Mg vacancy are non-equivalent due to the distortion. The defect states\nlocalized in the band gap are obtained by applying hybrid functional\ncalculations, which is very important for optical properties. At ambient\ncondition, the absorption peak at ~2.5 and ~2.6 eV is assigned to V^{0} and\nV^{-} center, respectively. With increasing pressure, the absorption peak shows\nblue shift. The trend is consistent with the experimental observation.\n", "  White noise analysis is used to derive the propagator of an open quantum\nsystem consisting of a harmonic oscillator which is coupled to an environment\nconsisting of N multimode harmonic oscillators. The quantum propagators are\nobtained after solving for the normal modes of the system-environment\ninteraction in order to decouple the coordinates in the Lagrangian describing\nthe dynamics of the system, the environment and their interaction with each\nother. The decoupled Lagrangian is then used in the path integral corresponding\nto the propagator of the system, with the path integral evaluated using white\nnoise analysis. The resulting propagator is then found to consist of a product\nof N simple harmonic oscillator propagators. N-2 of these propagators\ncorrespond to the degenerate normal mode frequencies of the system-environment\ninteraction, while the other 2 correspond to the non-degenerate normal mode\nfrequencies. This method of deriving the propagators greatly simplifies the\ntask of mathematically describing the dynamics of the open quantum system. The\nease of use of this method suggests that, together with its inherent\nmathematical rigor, white noise analysis can be a powerful tool in analyzing\nthe dynamics of an open quantum system.\n", "  Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a\nsignificant problem in network science with great applied values to the\nsociety. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source\nlocalization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex\nnetworks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency\nand robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks\nwith arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to\nquantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes\nthat produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the\nminimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source\nlocalization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved\nusing compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical\nnetworks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more\nreadily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected\nnetwork with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is\nsufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our\nunderstanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient\ntools with broad applications.\n", "  As one of the extensions of the Standard Model, we investigate the anomalous\nfour-point $\\tau-W-\\nu_\\tau-\\gamma$ scalar- and tensor-type interactions, which\noriginate from the gauge invariant dimension-five operators. The coupling\nconstants are constrained by the measured branching ratio of the $\\tau^-\n\\rightarrow \\mu^- \\nu_{\\tau} \\bar{\\nu_\\mu} \\gamma$ decay:\n$-4.9<\\kappa_\\tau^S<9.4$ and $-1.4<\\kappa_\\tau^T<2.8$ at the 95% confidence\nlevel for the scalar and tensor interactions, respectively.\n", "  We describe a list of open problems in random matrix theory and the theory of\nintegrable systems that was presented at the conference Asymptotics in\nIntegrable Systems, Random Matrices and Random Processes and Universality,\nCentre de Recherches Mathematiques, Montreal, June 7-11, 2015. We also describe\nprogress that has been made on problems in an earlier list presented by the\nauthor on the occasion of his 60th birthday in 2005 (see [Deift P., Contemp.\nMath., Vol. 458, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 2008, 419-430,\narXiv:0712.0849]).\n", "  In this paper, we represent the exact solution of a two phase inverse\nspherical Stefan problem, where along with unknown temperature functions heat\nflux function has to be determined. Suggested solution is obtained from new\nform of integral error function and its properties which are represented in the\nform of series whose coefficients have to be determined. The model problem can\nbe used for mathematical modeling and investigation of arc phenomena in\nelectrical contacts.\n", "  The assumption is made that only transversely polarized photons are needed\nfor a correct description of Quantum Electrodynamics. A simple mathematical\ntransformation is used to introduce new field operators which satisfy the full\nMaxwell equations. In particular, they reproduce Coulomb forces between\ndifferent regions of the charge field. The analogy with the polaron problem can\ngive some insight in the physics underlying the transformation. In this context\nit is shown that the interaction of the electron field with a transversely\npolarized photon field can form bound states. The binding energy peaks for long\nwavelength photons.\n", "  We study the magnetic properties of single crystals of rutile TiO2 implanted\nwith cobalt for various fluences. The temperature variation of zero field\ncooled(ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetization shows a much higher blocking\ntemperature (TB) along [1-10]. Similarly the scaling of magnetization isotherms\nabove TB is seen only when the field is parallel to [1-10] direction. With\nfield along this direction, the magnetization shows near saturation at a much\nsmaller field compared to that of[001] direction. The Co nanoclusters possess\nan \"easy\" and \"hard axis\" of magnetization coupled by the magneto crystalline\nanisotropy of secondary phases of cobalt with TiO2. In addition, at T=2 K we\nobserve a crossover in the magnetization vs field isotherms between the two\nfield directions in the samples which has been attributed to the anisotropic\nparamagnetism arising from cobalt present in 2+ ionic state with S = 3/2.\n", "  In this set of four lectures I will discuss some aspects of the Standard\nModel (SM) as a quantum field theory and related phenomenological observations\nwhich have played a crucial role in establishing the $SU(2)_{L} \\times\nU(1)_{Y}$ gauge theory as the correct description of Electro-Weak (EW)\ninteractions. I will first describe in brief the idea of EW unification as well\nas basic aspects of the Higgs mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. After\nthis I will discuss anomaly cancellation, custodial symmetry and implications\nof the high energy behavior of scattering amplitudes for the particle spectrum\nof the EW theory. This will be followed up by a discussion of the 'indirect'\nconstraints on the SM particle masses such as $M_{c}, M_{t}$ and $M_{h}$ from\nvarious precision EW measurements. I will end by discussing the theoretical\nlimits on $M_{h}$ and implications of the observed Higgs mass for the SM and\nbeyond.\n", "  We report experimental and theoretical investigations of coherent perfect\nchanneling (CPC), a process that two incoming coherent waves in waveguides are\ncompletely channeled into one or two other waveguides with little energy\ndissipation via strong coherent interaction between the two waves mediated by a\ndeep subwavelength dimension scatterer at the common junction of the\nwaveguides. Two such scatterers for acoustic waves are discovered, one\nconfirmed by experiments and the other predicted by theory, and their\nscattering matrices are formulated. Scatterers with other CPC scattering\nmatrices are explored, and preliminary investigations of their properties are\nconducted. The scattering matrix formulism makes it possible to extend the\napplicable domain of CPC to other scalar waves, such as electromagnetic waves\nand quantum wavefunctions.\n", "  We study the modifications of the $\\gamma\\gamma\\to ZH$ amplitudes and cross\nsections generated by Higgs and top quark compositeness in particular within\nthe CSM concept. We insist on the particular interest of polarized\nphoton-photon collisions which should allow to identify the origin of the large\nobservable differences between various, CSM conserving or CSM violating,\ncompositeness possibilities.\n", "  Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers have emerged as\npromising candidates for future valleytronics-based quantum information\ntechnologies. Two distinct momentum-states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs\nin these materials can be deterministically initialized via irradiation with\ncircularly polarized light. Here, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of such\na valley polarization in monolayer tungsten diselenide by means of\ntime-resolved Kerr reflectometry. The observed Kerr signal in our sample stems\nexclusively from charge-neutral excitons. Our findings support the picture of a\nfast decay of the valley polarization of bright excitons due to radiative\nrecombination, intra-conduction-band spin-flip transitions,\nintervalley-scattering processes, and the formation of long-lived\nvalley-polarized dark states.\n", "  This note is an attempt to interpret some excesses, not yet significant due\nto systematics, observed by ATLAS and CMS in various analyses related to the\nstandard channels ttH, ttZ and ttW. It is argued, within a composite\ninterpretation of top particles, that such excesses are not necessarily related\nto these channels themselves, although this is not excluded, but due to the\nunderlying presence of either vector-like heavy quarks tprime,bprime or to\nfinal states as predicted in composite theories. The outcome of this discussion\nis that although it will not be easy to reach an exclusive interpretation, the\ndata collected at 13 TeV may establish the origin of this effect as coming from\nthe four top quark topology.\n", "  We present a simple electromechanical finite difference model to study the\nresponse of a piezoelectric polyvinylidenflourid (PVDF) transducer to\noptoacoustic (OA) pressure waves in the acoustic nearfield prior to thermal\nrelaxation of the OA source volume. The assumption of nearfield conditions,\ni.e. the absence of acoustic diffraction, allows to treat the problem using a\none-dimensional numerical approach. Therein, the computational domain is\nmodeled as an inhomogeneous elastic medium, characterized by its local wave\nvelocities and densities, allowing to explore the effect of stepwise impedance\nchanges on the stress wave propagation. The transducer is modeled as a thin\npiezoelectric sensing layer and the electromechanical coupling is accomplished\nby means of the respective linear constituting equations. Considering a\nlow-pass characteristic of the full experimental setup, we obtain the resulting\ntransducer signal. Complementing transducer signals measured in a controlled\nlaboratory experiment with numerical simulations that result from a model of\nthe experimental setup, we find that, bearing in mind the apparent limitations\nof the one-dimensional approach, the simulated transducer signals can be used\nvery well to predict and interpret the experimental findings.\n", "  In this paper we formulate and analyze the mixed formulation of the\none-dimensional equilibrium model of elastic stents. The model is based on the\ncurved rod model for the inextensible and ushearable struts and is formulated\nin the weak form in \\v{C}ani\\'{c} and Tamba\\v{c}a, 2012. It is given by a\nsystem of ordinary differential equations at the graph structure. In order to\nnumerically treat the model using finite element method the mixed formulation\nis plead for. We obtain equivalence of the weak and the mixed formulation by\nproving the Babuska--Brezzi condition for the stent structure.\n", "  Testable Higgs partners may be sought within the extensions of the SM Higgs\nsector aimed at generating neutrino masses at the loop level. We study a\nviability of extended Higgs sectors for two selected models of radiative\nneutrino masses: a one-loop mass model, providing the Higgs partner within a\nreal triplet scalar representation, and a three-loop mass model, providing it\nwithin its two-Higgs-doublet sector. The Higgs sector in the one-loop model may\nremain stable and perturbative up to the Planck scale, whereas the three-loop\nmodel calls for a UV completion around 106 GeV. Additional vector-like lepton\nand exotic scalar fields, which are required to close one- and three-loop\nneutrino-mass diagrams, play a decisive role for the testability of the\nrespective models. We constrain the parameter space of these models using LHC\nbounds on diboson resonances.\n", "  The presence of neutral species in a plasma has been shown to greatly affect\nthe properties of magnetohydrodynamic waves. For instance, the interaction\nbetween ions and neutrals through momentum transfer collisions causes the\ndamping of Alfv\\'en waves and alters their oscillation frequency and phase\nspeed. When the collision frequencies are larger than the frequency of the\nwaves, single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximations can accurately describe\nthe effects of partial ionization, since there is a strong coupling between the\nvarious species. However, at higher frequencies, the single-fluid models are\nnot applicable and more complex approaches are required. Here, we use a\nfive-fluid model with three ionized and two neutral components, which takes\ninto consideration Hall's current and Ohm's diffusion in addition to the\nfriction due to collisions between different species. We apply our model to\nplasmas composed of hydrogen and helium, and allow the ionization degree to be\narbitrary. By means of the analysis of the corresponding dispersion relation\nand numerical simulations, we study the properties of small-amplitude\nperturbations. We discuss the effect of momentum transfer collisions on the\nion-cyclotron resonances and compare the importance of magnetic resistivity,\nion-neutral and ion-ion collisions on the wave damping at various frequency\nranges. Application to partially ionized plasmas of the solar atmosphere are\nperformed.\n", "  We consider the behavior of a collective variable in a complex system formed\nby a finite number of interacting subunits. Each of them is characterized by a\ndegree of freedom with an intrinsic nonlinear bistable stochastic dynamics. The\nlack of ergodicity of the collective variable requires the consideration of a\nfeedback mechanism of the collective behavior on the individual dynamics. We\nexplore numerically this issue within the context of two simple finite models\nwith a feedback mechanism of the Weiss mean-field type: a global coupling model\nand another one with nearest neighbors coupling.\n", "  We prove local and global energy decay for the asymptotically periodic damped\nwave equation on the Euclidean space. Since the behavior of high frequencies is\nalready mostly understood, this paper is mainly about the contribution of low\nfrequencies. We show in particular that the damped wave behaves like a solution\nof a heat equation which depends on the H-limit of the metric and the mean\nvalue of the absorption index.\n", "  In this paper a type D breakdown of the Navier Stokes (NS) in d=3 is\ndemonstrated. The element of the breakdown also occurs in the Euler equation.\nWe consider the fact that in d=2 Ladyzhenskaya found a generalized type B\nsolution. The discussion revolves around the notion, also found in quantum spin\ntheory, that in the behavior of a system can be quite different from the\nbehavior in d=2 dimensions. Concerning applications, our resolution of the\nproblem implies that e.g. hydrology problems formulated as a NS equation can\nonly be solved in computational approximation.\n", "  We show, in the case of a special dipolar source, that electromagnetic fields\nin fractional quantum mechanics have an unexpected space dependence:\npropagating fields may have non-transverse components, and the distinction\nbetween near-field zone and wave zone is blurred. We employ an extension of\nMaxwell theory, Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics, which is compatible with\ncurrents $j^\\nu$ conserved globally but not locally, we have derived in another\nwork the field equation $\\partial_\\mu F^{\\mu \\nu}=j^\\nu+i^\\nu$, where $i^\\nu$\nis a non-local function of $j^\\nu$, called \"secondary current\". Y.\\ Wei has\nrecently proved that the probability current in fractional quantum mechanics is\nin general not locally conserved. We compute this current for a Gaussian wave\npacket with fractional parameter $a=3/2$ and find that in a suitable limit it\ncan be approximated by our simplified dipolar source. Currents which are not\nlocally conserved may be present also in other quantum systems whose wave\nfunctions satisfy non-local equations. The combined electromagnetic effects of\nsuch sources and their secondary currents are very interesting both\ntheoretically and for potential applications.\n", "  A charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole which has\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ (Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om+$\\Lambda$ or\nRN+$\\Lambda$), active gravitational mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ is studied\nwith exterior Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in (2+1) dimensional\nspacetime. We find a new classes of exact solutions of the charged black hole\nwhere the generalized Birkoff's theorem is assumed to be valid. It is found\nthat the cosmological constant is negative inside the black hole. We confirm it\nfrom the geodesic equations too. The cosmological constant is found to be\ndependent on $R, Q$ and $a(v)$ which correspond to the areal radius, charge, of\nthe black hole and the scale factor of the universe respectively. We note that\nthe expansion of the universe affects the size and the mass of the black hole.\nAn important observation is that, for an observer at infinity, both the mass\nand charge of black hole increase with the contraction of the universe and\ndecrease with the expansion of the universe.\n", "  Direct studies of intense laser-solid interactions is still of great\nchallenges, because of the many coupled physical mechanisms, such as direct\nlaser heating, ionization dynamics, collision among charged particles, and\nelectrostatic or electromagnetic instabilities, to name just a few. Here, we\npresent a full particle-in-cell simulation (PIC) framework, which enables us to\ncalculate laser-solid interactions in a \"first principle\" way, covering almost\n\"all\" the coupled physical mechanisms. Apart from the mechanisms above, the\nnumerical self-heating of PIC simulations, which usually appears in\nsolid-density plasmas, is also well controlled by the proposed\n\"layered-density\" method. This method can be easily implemented into the\nstate-of-the-art PIC codes. Especially, the electron heating/acceleration at\nrelativistically intense laser-solid interactions in the presence of large\nscale pre-formed plasmas is re-investigated by this PIC code. Results indicate\nthat collisional damping (even though it is very week) can significantly\ninfluence the electron heating/acceleration in front of the target. Furthermore\nthe Bremsstrahlung radiation will be enhanced by $2\\sim3$ times when the solid\nis dramatically heated and ionized. For the considered case, where laser is of\nintensity $10^{20}\\ \\text{W}/\\text{cm}^2$ and pre-plasma in front of the solid\ntarget is of scale-length $10\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, collision damping coupled with\nionization dynamics and Bremsstrahlung radiations is shown to lower the\n\"cut-off\" electron energy by $25\\%$. In addition, the resistive electromagnetic\nfields due to Ohmic-heating also play a non-ignorable role and must be included\nin real laser-solid interactions.\n", "  Linear waves are investigated in a rotating gas under the condition of strong\ncentrifugal acceleration of the order $10^6 g$ realized in gas centrifuges for\nseparation of uranium isotopes. Sound waves splits into three families of the\nwaves under these conditions. Dispersion equations are obtained. The\ncharacteristics of the waves strongly differ from the conventional sound waves\non polarisation, velocity of propagation and distribution of energy of the\nwaves in space for two families having frequencies above and below the\nfrequency of the conventional sound waves. The energy of these waves is\nlocalized in rarefied region of the gas. The waves of the third family were not\nspecified before. They propagate exactly along the rotational axis with the\nconventional sound velocity. These waves are polarized only along the\nrotational axis. Radial and azimuthal motions are not excited. Energy of the\nwaves is concentrated near the wall of the rotor where the density of the gas\nis largest.\n", "  Lecture notes on selected topics in the theory of gravitation.\n", "  In this work, we investigate mathematical models for electromagnetic wave\npropagation in dispersive isotropic media. We emphasize the link between\nphysical requirements and mathematical properties of the models. A particular\nattention is devoted to the notion of non-dissipativity and passivity. We\nconsider successively the case of so-called local media and general passive\nmedia. The models are studied through energy techniques, spectral theory and\ndispersion analysis of plane waves. For making the article self-contained, we\nprovide in appendix some useful mathematical background.\n", "  Hochst\\\"attler, Kirsch, and Warzel showed that the semicircle law holds for\ngeneralized Curie-Weiss matrix ensembles at or above the critical temperature.\nWe extend their result to the case of subcritical temperatures for which the\ncorrelations between the matrix entries are stronger. Nevertheless, one may use\nthe concept of approximately uncorrelated ensembles that was first introduced\nin the paper mentioned above. In order to do so one needs to remove the average\nmagnetization of the entries by an appropriate modification of the ensemble\nthat turns out to be of rank 1 thus not changing the limiting spectral measure.\n", "  In this contribution we review the recent progress in the modeling of Pulsar\nWind Nebulae (PWN). We start with a brief overview of the relevant physical\nprocesses in the magnetosphere, the wind-zone and the inflated nebula bubble.\nRadiative signatures and particle transport processes obtained from 3D\nsimulations of PWN are discussed in the context of optical and X-ray\nobservations. We then proceed to consider particle acceleration in PWN and\nelaborate on what can be learned about the particle acceleration from the\ndynamical structures called \"wisps\" observed in the Crab nebula. We also\ndiscuss recent observational and theoretical results of gamma-ray flares and\nthe inner knot of the Crab nebula, which had been proposed as the emission site\nof the flares. We extend the discussion to GeV flares from binary systems in\nwhich the pulsar wind interacts with the stellar wind from a companion star.\nThe chapter concludes with a discussion of solved and unsolved problems posed\nby PWN.\n", "  The microstructure of electrodeposited Ni films produced without and with\norganic additives (saccharin and formic acid) was investigated by X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) line profile analysis and cross-sectional transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM). Whereas the general effect of these additives on the\nmicrostructure (elimination of columnar growth as well as grain refinement) was\nreproduced, the pronounced intention of this study was to compare the results\nof various seldom-used high-performance structural characterization methods on\nidentical electrodeposited specimens in order to reveal fine details of\nstructural changes qualitatively not very common in this field. In the film\ndeposited without additives, a columnar structure was observed showing\nsimilarities to the T-zone of structure zone models. Both formic acid and\nsaccharin additives resulted in equiaxed grains with reduced size, as well as\nincreased dislocation and twin fault densities in the nanocrystalline films.\nMoreover, the structure became homogeneous and free of texture within the total\nfilm thickness due to the additives. Saccharin yielded smaller grain size and\nlarger defect density than formic acid. A detailed analysis of the grain size\nand twin boundary spacing distributions was carried out with the complementary\napplication of TEM and XRD, by carefully distinguishing between the TEM and XRD\ngrain sizes.\n", "  Polycrystalline diamond coatings have been grown on cemented carbide\nsubstrates with different aspect ratios by a microwave plasma CVD in\nmethane-hydrogen gas mixtures. To protect the edges of the substrates from\nnon-uniform heating due to the plasma edge effect, a special plateholder with\npockets for group growth has been used. The difference in heights of the\nsubstrates and plateholder, and its influence on the diamond film mean grain\nsize, growth rate, phase composition and stress was investigated. The substrate\ntemperature range, within which uniform diamond films are produced with good\nadhesion, is determined. The diamond-coated cutting inserts produced at\noptimized process exhibited a reduction of cutting force and wear resistance by\na factor of two, and cutting efficiency increase by 4.3 times upon turning A390\nAl-Si alloy as compared to performance of uncoated tools.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate that locally, the $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ expansion\nof a string propagating in AdS can be summed into a closed expression, where\nthe $\\alpha'$ dependence is manifested. The T-dual of this sum exactly matches\nthe expression controlling all genus expansion in the Goparkumar-Vafa formula,\nwhich in turn also matches the loop expansion of the Chern-Simons gauge theory.\nWe therefore find an exact correspondence between the $\\alpha^{\\prime}$\nexpansion for a string moving in AdS and the genus expansion of a string\npropagating in four dimensional flat spacetime. We are then able to give a\nclosed form of the $\\alpha'$ expansion for all values of\n$\\sqrt{\\alpha'}/R_{AdS}$. Moreover, the correspondence makes it possible to\nconjecture the exact $g_s$ dependence of the strongly coupled theories.\n", "  The quantum-mechanical theory of the decay of unstable states is revisited.\nWe show that the decay is non-exponential both in the short-time and long-time\nlimits using a more physical definition of the decay rate than the one usually\nused. We report results of numerical studies based on Winter's model that may\nelucidate qualitative features of exponential and non-exponential decay more\ngenerally. The main exponential stage is related to the formation of a\nradiating state that maintains the shape of its wave function with\nexponentially diminishing normalization. We discuss situations where the\nradioactive decay displays several exponents. The transient stages between\ndifferent regimes are typically accompanied by interference of various\ncontributions and resulting oscillations in the decay curve. The decay curve\ncan be fully oscillatory in a two-flavor generalization of Winter's model with\nsome values of the parameters. We consider the implications of that result for\nmodels of the oscillations reported by GSI.\n", "  As part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM)\nproject, we present an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) in the nearby fast-rotating early-type galaxy NGC4697. This estimate is\nbased on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) cycle-3\nobservations of the 12CO(2-1) emission line with a linear resolution of 29 pc\n(0.53\"). We find that NGC4697 hosts a small relaxed central molecular gas disc\nwith a mass of 1.6x10^7 Msun, co-spatial with the obscuring dust disc visible\nin optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We also resolve thermal 1mm\ncontinuum emission from the dust in this disc. NGC4697 is found to have a very\nlow molecular gas velocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{gas}=1.65^{+0.68}_{-0.65}$\nkm/s. This seems to be partially because the giant molecular cloud mass\nfunction is not fully sampled, but other mechanisms such as chemical\ndifferentiation in a hard radiation field or morphological quenching also seem\nto be required. We detect a Keplerian increase of the rotation of the molecular\ngas in the very centre of NGC4697, and use forward modelling of the ALMA data\ncube in a Bayesian framework with the KINematic Molecular Simulation (KinMS)\ncode to estimate a SMBH mass of ($1.3_{-0.17}^{+0.18})\\times10^8$ Msun and an\ni-band mass-to-light ratio of $2.14_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$ Msun/Lsun (at the 99%\nconfidence level). Our estimate of the SMBH mass is entirely consistent with\nprevious measurements from stellar kinematics. This increases confidence in the\ngrowing number of SMBH mass estimates being obtained in the ALMA era.\n", "  We investigate finite-size effects on diffusion in confined fluids using\nmolecular dynamics simulations and hydrodynamic calculations. Specifically, we\nconsider a Lennard-Jones fluid in slit pores without slip at the interface and\nshow that the use of periodic boundary conditions in the directions along the\nsurfaces results in dramatic finite-size effects, in addition to that of the\nphysically relevant confining length. As in the simulation of bulk fluids,\nthese effects arise from spurious hydrodynamic interactions between periodic\nimages and from the constraint of total momentum conservation. We derive\nanalytical expressions for the correction to the diffusion coefficient in the\nlimits of both elongated and flat systems, which are in excellent agreement\nwith the molecular simulation results except for the narrowest pores, where the\ndiscreteness of the fluid particles starts to play a role. The present work\nimplies that the diffusion coefficients for wide nanopores computed using\nelongated boxes suffer from finite-size artifacts which had not been previously\nappreciated. In addition, our analytical expression provides the correction to\nbe applied to the simulation results for finite (possibly small) systems. It\napplies not only to molecular but also to all mesoscopic hydrodynamic\nsimulations, including Lattice-Boltzmann, Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics or\nDissipative Particle Dynamics, which are often used to investigate confined\nsoft matter involving colloidal particles and polymers.\n", "  We provide an origin of family replications in the standard model of particle\nphysics by constructing renormalizable, asymptotically free, four dimensional\nlocal gauge theories that dynamically generate the fifth and sixth dimensions\nwith magnetic fluxes.\n", "  We consider a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayer on a triangular lattice\nin the framework of the planar Heisenberg model. The impact of the geometrical\nfrustration in this system on the magnetization curves and the exchange bias\nphenomenon is studied. The magnetization curves and the phase diagram for such\nsystems are obtained. We observe horizontal plateaus and a split of the\nhysteresis loop on the magnetization curves. It is shown that the shift of the\nhysteresis loop (exchange bias) occurs for the systems with a magnetically hard\nantiferromagnet.\n", "  In this work the evolution of a wavefunction in an infinite potential well\nwith time dependent boundaries is investigated. Previous methods for wells with\nwalls moving at a constant velocity are summarised. These methods are extended\nto wells with slowly accelerating walls. The location and time of the revivals\nin the well of the initial wavefunction are derived using Jacobi's elliptic\ntheta function.\n"]}
