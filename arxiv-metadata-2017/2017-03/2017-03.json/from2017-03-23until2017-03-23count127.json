The\nresult is a nonlinear diffusion equation for the one-particle probability\ndensity function, with an overall collective diffusion which depends on both\nthe excluded-volume and the narrow confinement. By including both these effects\nthe equation is able to interpolate between severe confinement (for example,\nsingle-file diffusion) and unconfined diffusion. Numerical solutions of both\nthe effective nonlinear diffusion equation and the stochastic particle system\nare presented and compared. As an application, the case of diffusion under a\nratchet potential is considered, and the change in transport properties due to\nexcluded-volume and confinement effects is examined.\n", "  The moduli space of stable pairs on a local surface $X=K_S$ is in general\nnon-compact. The action of $\\mathbb{C}^*$ on the fibres of $X$ induces an\naction on the moduli space and the stable pair invariants of $X$ are defined by\nthe virtual localization formula. We study the contribution to these invariants\nof stable pairs (scheme theoretically) supported in the zero section $S \\subset\nX$. Sometimes there are no other contributions, e.g. when the curve class\n$\\beta$ is irreducible.\n  We relate these surface stable pair invariants to the Poincar\\'e invariants\nof D\\\"urr-Kabanov-Okonek. The latter are equal to the Seiberg-Witten invariants\nof $S$ by work of D\\\"urr-Kabanov-Okonek and Chang-Kiem. We give two\napplications of our result. (1) For irreducible curve classes the GW/PT\ncorrespondence for $X = K_S$ implies Taubes' GW/SW correspondence for $S$. (2)\nWhen $p_g(S) = 0$, the difference of surface stable pair invariants in class\n$\\beta$ and $K_S - \\beta$ is a universal topological expression.\n", "  Transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets is a tool to characterize rocky\nplanets and explore their habitability. Using the Earth itself as a proxy, we\nmodel the atmospheric cross section as a function of wavelength, and show the\neffect of each atmospheric species, Rayleigh scattering and refraction from 115\nto 1000nm. Clouds do not significantly affect this picture because refraction\nprevents the lowest 12.75km of the atmosphere, in a transiting geometry for an\nEarth-Sun analog, to be sampled by a distant observer. We calculate the\neffective planetary radius for the primary eclipse spectrum of an Earth-like\nexoplanet around a Sun-like star. Below 200nm, ultraviolet(UV) O_2 absorption\nincreases the effective planetary radius by about 180km, versus 27km at\n760.3nm, and 14km in the near-infrared (NIR) due predominantly to refraction.\nThis translates into a 2.6% change in effective planetary radius over the\nUV-NIR wavelength range, showing that the ultraviolet is an interesting\nwavelength range for future space missions.\n", "  We study moduli spaces $\\mathcal{N}$ of rank 2 stable reflexive sheaves on\n$\\mathbb{P}^3$. Fixing Chern classes $c_1$, $c_2$, and summing over $c_3$, we\nconsider the generating function $\\mathsf{Z}^{\\mathrm{refl}}(q)$ of Euler\ncharacteristics of such moduli spaces. The action of the torus $T$ on\n$\\mathbb{P}^3$ lifts to $\\mathcal{N}$ and we classify all sheaves in\n$\\mathcal{N}^T$. This leads to an explicit expression for\n$\\mathsf{Z}^{\\mathrm{refl}}(q)$. Since $c_3$ is bounded below and above,\n$\\mathsf{Z}^{\\mathrm{refl}}(q)$ is a polynomial. We find a simple formula for\nits leading term when $c_1=-1$.\n  Next, we study moduli spaces of rank 2 stable torsion free sheaves on\n$\\mathbb{P}^3$ and consider the generating function of Euler characteristics of\nsuch moduli spaces. We give an expression for this generating function in terms\nof $\\mathsf{Z}^{\\mathrm{refl}}(q)$ and Euler characteristics of Quot schemes of\ncertain $T$-equivariant reflexive sheaves, which are studied elsewhere. Many\ntechniques of this paper apply to any toric 3-fold. In general,\n$\\mathsf{Z}^{\\mathrm{refl}}(q)$ depends on the choice of polarization which\nleads to wall-crossing phenomena. We briefly illustrate this in the case of\n$\\mathbb{P}^2 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$.\n", "  We investigate the nuclear and the Coulomb contributions to the breakup cross\nsections of $^6$Li in collisions with targets in different mass ranges.\nComparing cross sections for different targets at collision energies\ncorresponding to the same $E/V_{\\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle B}}$, we obtain\ninteresting scaling laws. First, we derive an approximate linear expression for\nthe nuclear breakup cross section as a function of $A_{\\mathrm{%\n\\scriptscriptstyle T}}^{1/3}$. We then confirm the validity of this expression\nperforming CDCC calculations. Scaling laws for the Coulomb breakup cross\nsection are also investigated. In this case, our CDCC calculations indicate\nthat this cross section has a linear dependence on the atomic number of the\ntarget. This behavior is explained by qualitative arguments. Our findings,\nwhich are consistent with previously obtained results for higher energies, are\nimportant when planning for experiments involving exotic weakly bound nuclei.\n", "  We establish the complete spectral exponential, and the strong\nHilbert-Schmidt dynamical localization for the one-dimensional multi-particle\nAnderson tight-binding model and for weakly interacting particles system. In\nother words, we show stability of the one-dimensional localization from the\nsingle-particle to multi-particle systems with an arbitrary large but finite\nnumber of particles and for sufficient weakly interacting models. The proof\nuses the multi-scale analysis estimates for multi-particle systems. The common\nprobability distribution function of the random external potential in the\nAnderson model is assumed to be log-H\\\"older continuous, so the results apply\nto a large class of Anderson models.\n", "  Most models used to predict or fit exoplanet transmission spectra do not\ninclude all the effects of atmospheric refraction. Namely, the angular size of\nthe star with respect to the planet can limit the lowest altitude, or highest\ndensity and pressure, probed during primary eclipses, as no rays passing below\nthis critical altitude can reach the observer. We discuss this geometrical\neffect of refraction for all exoplanets, and tabulate the critical altitude,\ndensity and pressure for an exoplanet identical to Earth with a 1 bar N2/O2\natmosphere, as a function of both the incident stellar flux (Venus, Earth, and\nMars-like) at the top of the atmosphere, and the spectral type (O5-M9) of the\nhost star. We show that such a habitable exo-Earth can be probed to a surface\npressure of 1 bar only around the coolest stars. We present 0.4-5.0 micron\nmodel transmission spectra of Earth's atmosphere viewed as a transiting\nexoplanet, and show how atmospheric refraction modifies the transmission\nspectrum depending on the spectral type of the host star. We demonstrate that\nrefraction is another phenomenon that can potentially explain flat transmission\nspectra over some spectral regions.\n", "  This paper studies the selection of partners for R&D collaborations of firms\nboth empirically, by analyzing a large data set of R&D alliances over 25 years,\nand theoretically, by utilizing an agent-based model of alliance formation. We\nquantify the topological position of a firm in the R&D network by means of the\nweighted $k$-core decomposition which assigns a coreness value to each firm.\nThe evolution of these coreness values over time reconstructs the career path\nof individual firms, where lower coreness indicates a better integration of\nfirms in an evolving R&D network. Using a large patent dataset, we demonstrate\nthat coreness values strongly correlate with the number of patents of a firm.\nAnalyzing coreness differences between firms and their partners, we identify a\nchange in selecting partners: less integrated firms choose partners of similar\ncoreness until they reach their best network position. After that, well\nintegrated firms (with low coreness) choose preferably partners with high\ncoreness, either newcomers or firms from the periphery. We use the agent-based\nmodel to test whether this change in behavior needs to be explained by means of\nstrategic considerations, i.e. firms switching their strategy in choosing\npartners dependent on their network position. We find that the observed\nbehavior can be well reproduced without such strategic considerations, this way\nchallenging the role of strategies in explaining macro patterns of\ncollaborations.\n", "  We find general solutions of some field equations (systems of equations) in\npseudo-Euclidian spaces (so-called primitive field equations). These equations\nare used in the study of the Dirac equation and Yang-Mills equations. These\nequations are invariant under orthogonal O(p,q) coordinate transformations and\ninvariant under gauge transformations, which depend on some Lie groups. In this\npaper we use some new geometric objects - Clifford field vector and an algebra\nof h-forms which is a generalization of the algebra of differential forms and\nthe Atiyah-K\\\"{a}hler algebra.\n", "  Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and\npsychologists, have seen broad and increasing applications across several\ndisciplines of late. Amongst a plethora of application specific definitions\navailable in the literature to rank the vertices, closeness centrality,\nbetweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality (page-rank) have been the\nmost important and widely applied ones. Networks where information, signal or\ncommodities are flowing on the edges, surrounds us. Betweenness centrality\ncomes as a handy tool to analyze such systems, but betweenness computation is a\ndaunting task in large size networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient\nheuristic to determine the betweenness-ordering of $k$ vertices (where $k$ is\nvery less than the total number of vertices) without computing their exact\nbetweenness indices. The algorithm is based on a non-uniform node sampling\nmodel which is developed based on the analysis of Erdos-Renyi graphs. We apply\nour approach to find the betweenness-ordering of vertices in several synthetic\nand real-world graphs. The proposed heuristic results very efficient ordering\neven when runs for a linear time in the terms of the number of edges. We\ncompare our method with the available techniques in the literature and show\nthat our method produces more efficient ordering than the currently known\nmethods.\n", "  We investigate the 9Be + 208Pb elastic scattering and fusion at energies\naround the Coulomb barrier. The $^9$Be nucleus is described in a \\alpha +\n\\alpha + n three-body model, using the hyperspherical coordinate method. The\nscattering with $^{208}$Pb is then studied with the Continuum Discretized\nCoupled Channel (CDCC) method, where the \\alpha + \\alpha + n continuum is\napproximated by a discrete number of pseudostates. Optical potentials for the\n$\\alpha+^{208}$Pb and $n+^{208}$Pb systems are taken from the literature. We\npresent elastic-scattering and fusion cross sections at different energies, and\ninvestigate the convergence with respect to the truncation of the \\alpha +\n\\alpha + n continuum. A good agreement with experiment is obtained, considering\nthat there is no parameter fitting. We show that continuum effects increase at\nlow energies.\n", "  In this paper we consider different operators acting on Clifford algebras. We\nconsider Reynolds operator of Salingaros' vee group. This operator average\" an\naction of Salingaros' vee group on Clifford algebra. We consider conjugate\naction on Clifford algebra.\n  We present a relation between these operators and projection operators onto\nfixed subspaces of Clifford algebras. Using method of averaging we present\nsolutions of system of commutator equations.\n", "  We develop the a posteriori error analysis of finite element approximations\nof implicit power-law-like models for viscous incompressible fluids. The Cauchy\nstress and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient in the class of models\nunder consideration are related by a, possibly multi--valued, maximal monotone\n$r$-graph, with $\\frac{2d}{d+1}<r<\\infty$. We establish upper and lower bounds\non the finite element residual, as well as the local stability of the error\nbound. We then consider an adaptive finite element approximation of the\nproblem, and, under suitable assumptions, we show the weak convergence of the\nadaptive algorithm to a weak solution of the boundary-value problem. The\nargument is based on a variety of weak compactness techniques, including\nChacon's biting lemma and a finite element counterpart of the Acerbi--Fusco\nLipschitz truncation of Sobolev functions, introduced by L. Diening, C. Kreuzer\nand E. S\\\"uli [Finite element approximation of steady flows of incompressible\nfluids with implicit power-law-like rheology. SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51(2),\n984--1015].\n", "  We consider translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) for the\n$q$-state Potts model on a Cayley tree of order two. Recently a full\ndescription of the TISGMs was obtained, and it was shown in particular that at\nsufficiently low temperatures their number is $2^{q}-1$. In this paper for each\nTISGM $\\mu$ we explicitly give the set of boundary conditions such that\nlimiting Gibbs measures with respect to these boundary conditions coincide with\n$\\mu$.\n", "  Covariant renormalizable gravity is a Horava-like extension of general\nrelativity, enjoying full diffeomorphism invariance. However, the price to pay\nin order to maintain both covariance and renormalizability is the presence of\nan unknown fluid, whose non-standard coupling dynamically breaks Lorentz\ninvariance. In this brief work we identify and explain the nature of this\nfluid, which we note describes the conformal mode of gravity, and arises\nnaturally in frameworks such as that of mimetic gravity. Finally, we lay out\nextensions of the covariant Horava-like model, which can serve as a guide for\nfuture model-building in this area.\n", "  Atmospheric refraction affects to various degrees exoplanet transit, lunar\neclipse, as well as stellar occultation observations. Exoplanet retrieval\nalgorithms often use analytical expressions for the column abundance along a\nray traversing the atmosphere as well as for the deflection of that ray, which\nare first order approximations valid for low densities in a spherically\nsymmetric homogeneous isothermal atmosphere. We derive new analytical formulae\nfor both of these quantities, which are valid for higher densities, and use\nthem to refine and validate a new ray tracing algorithm which can be used for\narbitrary atmospheric temperature-pressure profiles. We illustrate with simple\nisothermal atmospheric profiles the consequences of our model for different\nplanets: temperate Earth-like and Jovian-like planets, as well as HD189733b,\nand GJ1214b. We find that, for both hot exoplanets, our treatment of refraction\ndoes not make much of a difference to pressures as high as 10 atmosphere, but\nthat it is important to consider the variation of gravity with altitude for\nGJ1214b. However, we find that the temperate atmospheres have an apparent scale\nheight significantly smaller than their actual density scale height at\ndensities larger than 1 amagat, thus increasing the difficulty of detecting\nspectral features originating in these regions. These denser atmospheric\nregions form a refractive boundary layer where column abundances and ray\ndeflection increases dramatically with decreasing impact parameter. This\nrefractive boundary layer mimics a surface, and none of the techniques\nmentioned above can probe atmospheric regions denser than about 4 amagat on\nthese temperate planets.\n", "  We study the low-temperature isothermal magnetic hysteresis of cubical and\nspherical nanoparticles with ferromagnetic (FM) core - antiferromagnetic (AF)\nshell morphology, in order to elucidate the sensitivity of the exchange bias\neffect to the shape of the particles and the structural imperfections at the\ncore-shell interface. We model the magnetic structure using a classical\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian with uniaxial anisotropy and simulate the hysteresis\nloop using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. For nanoparticles with\ngeometrically sharp interfaces, we find that cubes exhibit higher coercivity\nand lower exchange bias field than spheres of the same size. With increasing\ninterface roughness, the shape-dependence of the characteristic fields\ngradually decays and eventually, the distinction between cubical and spherical\nparticles is lost for moderately rough interfaces. The sensitivity of the\nexchange bias field to the microstructural details of the interface is\nquantified by a scaling factor (b) relating the bias field to the net moment of\nthe AF shell (Heb = bMAF + Ho). Cubical particles exhibit lower sensitivity to\nthe dispersed values of the net interfacial moment.\n", "  We consider the effects induced by the presence of hot and cold spots on the\nsource star in the light curves of simulated microlensing events due to either\nsingle or binary lenses taking into account the rotation of the source star and\nthe orbital motion of the lens system. Our goal is to study the anomalies\ninduced by these effects on simulated microlensing light curves.\n", "  We update determination of the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ masses of the charm and\nbottom quarks, from comparisons of the masses of the charmonium and bottomonium\n$1S$ states with their perturbative predictions up to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in $\\varepsilon$ expansion and using the\n$\\overline{\\rm MS}$ masses. Effects of non-zero charm-quark mass in the\nbottomonium masses are incorporated up to next-to-next-to-leading order. We\nobtain $\\overline m_c=1246\\pm 2 (d_3) \\pm 4 (\\alpha_s) \\pm 23 (\\text{h.o.}\n)~{\\rm MeV} $ and $\\overline m_b=4197\\pm 2 (d_3) \\pm 6 (\\alpha_s) \\pm 20\n(\\text{h.o.} )\\pm 5 (m_c)~ {\\rm MeV} $, which agree with the current Particle\nData Group values.\n", "  This paper develops a generalized formulation of Lagrangian mechanics on\nfibered manifolds, together with a reduction theory for symmetries\ncorresponding to Lie groupoid actions. As special cases, this theory includes\nnot only Lagrangian reduction (including reduction by stages) for Lie group\nactions, but also classical Routh reduction, which we show is naturally posed\nin this fibered setting. Along the way, we also develop some new results for\nLagrangian mechanics on Lie algebroids, most notably a new, coordinate-free\nformulation of the equations of motion. Finally, we extend the foregoing to\ninclude fibered and Lie algebroid generalizations of the Hamilton-Pontryagin\nprinciple of Yoshimura and Marsden, along with the associated reduction theory.\n", "  One of the most intriguing hints of a departure from the standard\ncosmological model is a large-scale dipolar power asymmetry in the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). If not a statistical fluke, its origins must lie in\nthe modulation of the position-space fluctuations via a physical mechanism,\nwhich requires the observation of new modes to confirm or refute. We introduce\nan approach to describe such a modulation in k space and calculate its effects\non the CMB temperature and lensing. We fit the k-space modulation parameters to\nPlanck 2015 temperature data and show that CMB lensing will not provide us with\nenough independent information to confirm or refute such a mechanism. However,\nour approach elucidates some poorly understood aspects of the asymmetry, in\nparticular that it is weakly constrained. Also, it will be particularly useful\nin predicting the effectiveness of polarization in testing a physical\nmodulation.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate cooling of trapped ions by collisions with\nco-trapped, higher mass neutral atoms. It is shown that the lighter\n$^{39}$K$^{+}$ ions, created by ionizing $^{39}$K atoms in a magneto-optical\ntrap (MOT), when trapped in an ion trap and subsequently allowed to cool by\ncollisions with ultracold, heavier $^{85}$Rb atoms in a MOT, exhibit a longer\ntrap lifetime than without the localized $^{85}$Rb MOT atoms. A similar cooling\nof trapped $^{85}$Rb$^{+}$ ions by ultracold $^{133}$Cs atoms in a MOT is also\ndemonstrated in a different experimental configuration to validate this\nmechanism of ion cooling by localized and centered ultracold neutral atoms. Our\nresults suggest that cooling of ions by localized cold atoms holds for any mass\nratio, thereby enabling studies on a wider class of atom-ion systems\nirrespective of their masses.\n", "  Standard field theoretic renormalization group is applied to the model of\nlandscape erosion introduced by R. Pastor-Satorras and D. H. Rothman [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 80: 4349 (1998); J. Stat. Phys. 93: 477 (1998)] yielding unexpected\nresults: the model is multiplicatively renormalizable only if it involves\ninfinitely many coupling constants ( i.e., the corresponding renormalization\ngroup equations involve infinitely many beta-functions). Despite this fact, the\none-loop counterterm can be derived albeit in a closed form in terms of the\ncertain function $V(h)$, entering the original stochastic equation, and its\nderivatives with respect to the height field $h$. Its Taylor expansion gives\nrise to the full infinite set of the one-loop renormalization constants,\nbeta-functions and anomalous dimensions. Instead of a set of fixed points,\nthere is a two-dimensional surface of fixed points that is likely to contain\ninfrared attractive region(s). If that is the case, the model exhibits scaling\nbehaviour in the infrared range. The corresponding critical exponents are\nnonuniversal through the dependence on the coordinates of the fixed point on\nthe surface, but satisfy certain universal exact relations.\n", "  We investigate the problem of noise bias in maximum likelihood and maximum a\nposteriori estimators for cosmic shear. We derive the leading and\nnext-to-leading order biases and compute them in the context of galaxy\nellipticity measurements, extending previous work on maximum likelihood\ninference for weak lensing. We show that a large part of the bias on these\npoint estimators can be removed using information already contained in the\nlikelihood when a galaxy model is specified, without the need for external\ncalibration. We test these bias-corrected estimators on simulated galaxy images\nsimilar to those expected from planned space-based weak lensing surveys, with\npromising results. We find that the introduction of an intrinsic shape prior\ncan help with mitigation of noise bias, such that the maximum a posteriori\nestimate can be made less biased than the maximum likelihood estimate.\nSecond-order terms offer a check on the convergence of the estimators, but are\nlargely sub-dominant. We show how biases propagate to shear estimates,\ndemonstrating in our simple setup that shear biases can be reduced by orders of\nmagnitude and potentially to within the requirements of planned space-based\nsurveys at mild signal-to-noise. We find that second-order terms can exhibit\nsignificant cancellations at low signal-to-noise when Gaussian noise is\nassumed, which has implications for inferring the performance of\nshear-measurement algorithms from simplified simulations. We discuss the\nviability of our point estimators as tools for lensing inference, arguing that\nthey allow for the robust measurement of ellipticity and shear.\n", "  We study the relative dust attenuation-inclination relation in 78,721 nearby\ngalaxies using the axis ratio dependence of optical-NIR colour, as measured by\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), and\nthe Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). In order to avoid to the\ngreatest extent possible attenuation-driven biases, we carefully select\ngalaxies using dust attenuation-independent near- and mid-IR luminosities and\ncolours. Relative u-band attenuation between face-on and edge-on disc galaxies\nalong the star forming main sequence varies from ~0.55 mag up to ~1.55 mag. The\nstrength of the relative attenuation varies strongly with both specific star\nformation rate and galaxy luminosity (or stellar mass). The dependence of\nrelative attenuation on luminosity is not monotonic, but rather peaks at\n$M_{3.4\\mu m} \\approx -21.5$, corresponding to $M_* \\approx 3\\times\n10^{10}M_{Sun}$. This behavior stands seemingly in contrast to some older\nstudies; we show that older works failed to reliably probe to higher\nluminosities, and were insensitive to the decrease in attenuation with\nincreasing luminosity for the brightest star-forming discs.\nBack-of-the-envelope scaling relations predict the strong variation of dust\noptical depth with specific star formation rate and stellar mass. More in-depth\ncomparisons using the scaling relations to model the relative attenuation\nrequire the inclusion of star-dust geometry to reproduce the details of these\nvariations (especially at high luminosities), highlighting the importance of\nthese geometrical effects.\n", "  The precise description of quantum nuclear fluctuations in atomistic\nmodelling is possible by employing path integral techniques, which involve a\nconsiderable computational overhead due to the need of simulating multiple\nreplicas of the system. Many approaches have been suggested to reduce the\nrequired number of replicas. Among these, high-order factorizations of the\nBoltzmann operator are particularly attractive for high-precision and\nlow-temperature scenarios. Unfortunately, to date several technical challenges\nhave prevented a widespread use of these approaches to study nuclear quantum\neffects in condensed-phase systems. Here we introduce an inexpensive molecular\ndynamics scheme that overcomes these limitations, thus making it possible to\nexploit the improved convergence of high-order path integrals without having to\nsacrifice the stability, convenience and flexibility of conventional\nsecond-order techniques. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by\nsimulations of liquid water and ice, as described by a neural-network potential\nfitted to dispersion-corrected hybrid density functional theory calculations.\n", "  There is strong experimental evidence that the superconductor Sr2RuO4 has a\nchiral p-wave order parameter. This symmetry does not require that the\nassociated gap has nodes, yet specific heat, ultrasound and thermal\nconductivity measurements indicate the presence of nodes in the superconducting\ngap structure of Sr2RuO4. Theoretical scenarios have been proposed to account\nfor the existence of accidental nodes or deep accidental minima within a p-wave\nstate. To elucidate the nodal structure of the gap, it is essential to know\nwhether the lines of nodes (or minima) are vertical (parallel to the tetragonal\nc axis) or horizontal (perpendicular to the c axis). Here, we report thermal\nconductivity measurements on single crystals of Sr2RuO4 down to 50 mK for\ncurrents parallel and perpendicular to the c axis. We find that there is\nsubstantial quasiparticle transport in the T = 0 limit for both current\ndirections. A magnetic field H immediately excites quasiparticles with\nvelocities both in the basal plane and in the c direction. Our data down to\nTc/30 and down to Hc/100 show no evidence that the nodes are in fact deep\nminima. Relative to the normal state, the thermal conductivity of the\nsuperconducting state is found to be very similar for the two current\ndirections, from H = 0 to H = Hc2. These findings show that the gap structure\nof Sr2RuO4 consists of vertical line nodes. Given that the c-axis dispersion\n(warping) of the Fermi surface in Sr2RuO4 varies strongly from surface to\nsurface, the small a-c anisotropy suggests that the line nodes are present on\nall three sheets of the Fermi surface. If imposed by symmetry, vertical line\nnodes would be inconsistent with a p-wave order parameter for Sr2RuO4. To\nreconcile the gap structure revealed by our data with a p-wave state, a\nmechanism must be found that produces accidental line nodes in Sr2RuO4.\n", "  A computationally inexpensive k.p-based interpolation scheme is developed\nthat can extend the eigenvalues and momentum matrix elements of a sparsely\nsampled k-point grid into a densely sampled one. Dense sampling, often required\nto accurately describe transport and optical properties of bulk materials, can\nbe demanding to compute, for instance, in combination with hybrid functionals\nin density functional theory (DFT) or with perturbative expansions beyond DFT\nsuch as the $GW$ method. The scheme is based on solving the k.p method and\nextrapolating from multiple reference k-points. It includes a correction term\nthat reduces the number of empty bands needed and ameliorates band\ndiscontinuities. We show how the scheme can be used to generate accurate band\nstructures, density of states, and dielectric functions. Several examples are\ngiven, using traditional and hybrid functionals, with Si, TiNiSn, and Cu as\nmodel materials. We illustrate that d-electron and semi-core states, which are\nparticular challenging for the k.p method, can be handled with the correction\nscheme if the sparse grid is not too sparse.\n", "  Continuous unitary transformations are a powerful tool to extract valuable\ninformation out of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, in which the so-called flow\nequation transforms the Hamiltonian to a diagonal or block-diagonal form in\nsecond quantization. Yet, one of their main challenges is how to approximate\nthe infinitely-many coupled differential equations that are produced throughout\nthis flow. Here we show that tensor networks offer a natural and\nnon-perturbative truncation scheme in terms of entanglement. The corresponding\nscheme is called \"entanglement-CUT\" or eCUT. It can be used to extract the\nlow-energy physics of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, including quasiparticle\nenergy gaps. We provide the general idea behind eCUT and explain its\nimplementation for finite 1d systems using the formalism of matrix product\noperators. We also present proof-of-principle results for the spin-1/2 1d\nquantum Ising model and the 3-state quantum Potts model in a transverse field.\nEntanglement-CUTs can also be generalized to higher dimensions and to the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  The possibility that the dark matter comprises primordial black holes (PBHs)\nis considered, with particular emphasis on the currently allowed mass windows\nat $10^{16}$ - $10^{17}\\,$g, $10^{20}$ - $10^{24}\\,$g and $1$ -\n$10^{3}\\,M_{\\odot}$. The Planck mass relics of smaller evaporating PBHs are\nalso considered. All relevant constraints (lensing, dynamical, large-scale\nstructure and accretion) are reviewed and various effects necessary for a\nprecise calculation of the PBH abundance (non-Gaussianity, non-sphericity,\ncritical collapse and merging) are accounted for. It is difficult to put all\nthe dark matter in PBHs if their mass function is monochromatic but this is\nstill possible if the mass function is extended, as expected in many scenarios.\nA novel procedure for confronting observational constraints with an extended\nPBH mass spectrum is therefore introduced. This applies for arbitrary\nconstraints and a wide range of PBH formation models, and allows us to identify\nwhich model-independent conclusions can be drawn from constraints over all mass\nranges. We focus particularly on PBHs generated by inflation, pointing out\nwhich effects in the formation process influence the mapping from the\ninflationary power spectrum to the PBH mass function. We then apply our scheme\nto two specific inflationary models in which PBHs provide the dark matter. The\npossibility that the dark matter is in intermediate-mass PBHs of $1$ -\n$10^{3}\\,M_{\\odot}$ is of special interest in view of the recent detection of\nblack-hole mergers by LIGO. The possibility of Planck relics is also intriguing\nbut virtually untestable.\n", "  By applying the properties of Fabry-Perot resonance and Rayleigh anomaly, we\nhave shown that a photonic crystal slab can scatter the light from an incident\nplane wave into a diffracted light with a very large reflection or transmission\ncoefficient. The enhanced field is either a propagating diffraction order (with\na grazing angle of diffraction) or a weakly evanescent order, so it can be\nparticularly useful for applications requiring an enhanced propagating field\n(or an enhanced field with a low attenuation). An efficient effective medium\ntechnique is developed for the design of the resonant photonic crystal slabs.\nNumerical simulations have shown that photonic crystal slabs with low index\ncontrast, such as the ones found in the cell wall of diatoms, can enhance the\nintensity of the incident light by four orders of magnitude.\n", "  State-selective enantiomeric excess is realized using microwave-driven\ncoherent population transfer. The method selectively promotes either R or S\nmolecules to a higher rotational state by phase-controlled microwave pulses\nthat drive electric-dipole allowed rotational transitions. We demonstrate the\nenantiomer-specific state transfer method using enantiopure samples of\n1,2-propanediol. This method of state-specific enantiomeric enrichment can be\napplied to a large class of asymmetric, chiral molecules that can be vaporized\nand cooled to the point where rotationally resolved spectroscopy is possible,\nincluding molecules that rapidly racemize. The rapid chiral switching\ndemonstrated here allows for new approaches in high-precision spectroscopic\nsearches for parity violation in chiral molecules.\n", "  We generalize the boundary value problem with a mixed boundary condition that\ninvolves the gauge and scalar fields in the context of Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton\ntheories. In particular, the expectation value of the dual scalar operator can\nbe a function of the expectation value of the current operator. The properties\nare prevalent in a fixed charge ensemble because the conserved charge is shared\nby both fields through the dilaton coupling, which is also responsible for\nnon-Fermi liquid properties. We study the on-shell action and the stress energy\ntensor to note practical importances of the boundary value problem. In the\npresence of the scalar fields, physical quantities are not fully fixed due to\nthe finite boundary terms that manifest in the massless scalar or the scalar\nwith mass saturating the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound.\n", "  We consider indirect detection of meta-stable dark matter particles decaying\ninto a stable neutral particle and a pair of standard model fermions. Due to\nthe softer energy spectra from the three-body decay, such models could\npotentially explain the AMS-02 positron excess without being constrained by the\nFermi-LAT gamma-ray data and the cosmic ray anti-proton measurements. We\nscrutinize over different final state fermions, paying special attention to\nhandling of the cosmic ray background and including various contributions from\ncosmic ray propagation with the help of the \\textsc{LikeDM} package. It is\nfound that primary decays into an electron-positron pair and a stable neutral\nparticle could give rise to the AMS-02 positron excess and, at the same time,\nstay unscathed against the gamma-ray and anti-proton constraints. Decays to a\nmuon pair or a mixed flavor electron-muon pair may also be viable depending on\nthe propagation models. Decays to all other standard model fermions are\nseverely disfavored.\n", "  Gate tunable p-type multilayer tin mono-sulfide (SnS) field-effect transistor\n(FET) devices with SnS thickness between 50 and 100 nm were fabricated and\nstudied to understand their performances. The devices showed anisotropic\ninplane conductance and room temperature field effect mobilities ~5 - 10\ncm$^2$/Vs. However, the devices showed appreciable OFF state conductance and an\nON-OFF ratio ~10 at room temperature. The weak gate tuning behavior in the\ndepletion regime of SnS devices is explained by the finite carrier screening\nlength effect which causes the existence of a conductive surface layer from\nintrinsic defects induced holes in SnS. Through etching and n-type surface\ndoping by Cs2CO3 to reduce/compensate the not-gatable holes near SnS flake's\ntop surface, the devices gained an order of magnitude improvement in the ON-OFF\nratio and hole Hall mobility ~ 100 cm$^2$/Vs at room temperature is observed.\nThis work suggests that in order to obtain effective switching and low OFF\nstate power consumption, two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor based depletion\nmode FETs should limit their thickness to within the Debye screening length of\ncarriers in the semiconductor.\n", "  In view of the new recent observation and measurement of the rotating and\nhighly-magnetized white dwarf AR Scorpii \\cite{Marsh:2016uhc}, we determine\nbounds of its moment of inertia, magnetic fields and radius. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the possibility of fast rotating and/or magnetized white dwarfs to\nbe source of detectable gravitational wave (GW) emission. Numerical stellar\nmodels at different baryon masses are constructed. For each star configuration,\nwe compute self-consistent relativistic solutions for white dwarfs endowed with\npoloidal magnetic fields by solving the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in a\nself-consistent way. The magnetic field supplies an anisotropic pressure,\nleading to the braking of the spherical symmetry of the star. In this case, we\ncompute the quadrupole moment of the mass distribution. Next, we perform an\nestimate of the GW of such objects. Finally, we show that the new recent\nobservation and measurement pulsar white dwarf AR Scorpii, as well other\nstellar models, are able to generate gravitational wave radiation that lies in\nthe bandwidth of the discussed next generation of space-based GW detectors\nDECI-hertz interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and Big Bang\nObserver (BBO).\n", "  The search for symmetry-protected 2D Dirac semimetals analogous to graphene\nis important both for fundamental and practical interest. The 2D Dirac cones\nare protected by crystalline symmetries and magnetic ordering may destroy their\nrobustness. Here we propose a general framework to classify stable 2D Dirac\nsemimetals in spin-orbit coupled systems having the combined time-reversal and\ninversion symmetries, and show the existence of the stable Dirac points in 2D\nantiferromagnetic semimetals. Compared to 3D Dirac semimetals which fall into\ntwo distinct classes, Dirac semimetals in 2D with combined time-reversal and\ninversion symmetries belongs to single class which is closely related to the\nnonsymmorphic space group symmetries. We further provide a concrete model in\nantiferromagnetic semimetals which supports symmetry-protected 2D Dirac points.\nThe symmetry breaking in such systems leads to 2D chiral topological states\nsuch as quantum anomalous Hall insulator and chiral topological superconductor\nphases.\n", "  A recursive scheme for the design of scatterers acting simultaneously as\nemitters and absorbers, such as lasers and coherent perfect absorbers in\noptics, at multiple prescribed frequencies is proposed. The approach is based\non the assembly of non-Hermitian emitter and absorber units into self-dual\nemitter-absorber trimers at different composition levels, exploiting the simple\nstructure of the corresponding transfer matrices. In particular, lifting the\nrestriction to parity-time-symmetric setups enables the realization of emitter\nand absorber action at distinct frequencies and provides flexibility in the\nchoice of realistic parameters. We further show how the same assembled\nscatterers can be rearranged to produce unidirectional and bidirectional\ntransparency at the selected frequencies. With the design procedure being\ngenerically applicable to wave scattering in single-channel settings, we\ndemonstrate it with concrete examples of photonic multilayer setups.\n", "  The EXO-200 Collaboration is searching for neutrinoless double beta decay\nusing a liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber. This measurement relies on\nmodeling the transport of charge deposits produced by interactions in the LXe\nto allow discrimination between signal and background events. Here we present\nmeasurements of the transverse diffusion constant and drift velocity of\nelectrons at drift fields between 20~V/cm and 615~V/cm using EXO-200 data. At\nthe operating field of 380~V/cm EXO-200 measures a drift velocity of\n1.705$_{-0.010}^{+0.014}$~mm/$\\mu$s and a transverse diffusion coefficient of\n55$\\pm$4~cm$^2$/s.\n", "  Inspired by some problems in Quantum Information Theory, we present some\nresults concerning decompositions of positive operators acting on finite\ndimensional Hilbert spaces. We focus on decompositions by families having\ngeometrical symmetry with respect to the Euclidean scalar product and we\ncharacterize all such decompositions, comparing our results with the case of\nSIC--POVMs from Quantum Information Theory. We also generalize some Welch--type\ninequalities from the literature.\n", "  One-dimensional (1D) infinite periodic systems exhibit vanishing group\nvelocity and diverging density of states (DOS) near band edges. However, in\npractice, systems have finite sizes and inevitably this prompts the question of\nwhether helpful physical quantities related to infinite systems, such as the\ngroup velocity that is deduced from the band structure, remain relevant in\nfinite systems. For instance, one may wonder how the DOS divergence can be\napproached with finite systems. Intuitively, one may expect that the\nimplementation of larger and larger DOS, or equivalently smaller and smaller\ngroup velocities, would critically increase the system length. Based on general\n1D-wave-physics arguments, we demonstrate that the large slow-light DOS\nenhancement of periodic systems can be observed with very short systems, whose\nlengths scale with the logarithm of the inverse of the group velocities. The\nunderstanding obtained for 1D systems leads us to propose a novel sort of\nmicrostructure to enhance light-matter interaction, a sort of photonic speed\nbump that abruptly changes the speed of light by a few orders of magnitude\nwithout any reflection. We show that the DOS enhancements of speed bumps result\nfrom a classical electromagnetic resonance characterized by a single resonance\nmode and also that the nature and the properties of the resonance are markedly\ndifferent from those of classical defect-mode photonic-crystal cavities.\n", "  Electroweak radiative corrections will play a major role in the analysis of\nseveral upcoming ultra-precision experiments such as Belle-II, so is crucial to\nmake sure that they are fully under control. The article outlines the recent\ndevelopments in the theoretical and computational approaches to one-loop (NLO)\nelectroweak radiative corrections to the parity-violating asymmetry in $e^- e^+\n\\to \\mu^- \\mu^+ (\\gamma)$ process with longitudinally polarized electrons. We\nderive asymptotic expressions for low and high energy regions (well below or\nabove $Z$-resonance, correspondingly) and analyze the leading contributions.\nFor most of energy regions, our results are in good agreement with precise\ncomputer-algebra based calculation and can used as a quicker alternative.\n", "  We study the dynamic critical phenomena near the possible high-density QCD\ncritical point inside the superfluid phase of nuclear and quark matter. We find\nthat this critical point belongs to a new dynamic universality class beyond the\nconventional classification by Hohenberg and Halperin. We show that the speed\nof the superfluid phonon vanishes at the critical point and that the dynamic\ncritical index is $z \\approx 2$.\n", "  MATLAB solver for general dispersion relation has been developed to study\nlocal instabilities in partially magnetized plasmas typical for ExB discharges.\nSeveral examples of the Simon-Hoh, lower-hybrid and ion-sound instabilities\nwith the parameters typical for Penning discharge are shown. This solver allows\nparametrically investigate the local dispersion relation for the wide range of\nplasma parameters and prepare reports.\n", "  By putting together an abstract view on quantum mechanics and a\nquantum-optics picture of the interactions of an atom with light, we develop a\ncorresponding set of C++ classes that set up the numerical analysis of an atom\nwith an arbitrary set of angular-momentum degenerate energy levels, arbitrary\nlight fields, and an applied magnetic field. As an example, we develop and\nimplement perturbation theory to compute the polarizability of an atom in an\nexperimentally relevant situation.\n", "  We report an experimental study on ion-exchange based modular micro-swimmers\nin low-salt water. Cationic ion-exchange particles and passive cargo particles\nassemble into self-propelling complexes, showing self-propulsion at speeds of\nseveral microns per second over extended distances and times. We quantify the\nassembly and speed of the complexes for different combinations of ion exchange\nparticles and cargo particles, substrate types, salt types and concentrations,\nand cell geometries. Irrespective of experimental boundary conditions, we\nobserve a regular development of the assembly shape with increasing number of\ncargo. Moreover, the swimming speed increases stepwise upon increasing the\nnumber of cargo and then saturates at a maximum speed, indicating an active\nrole of cargo in modular swimming. We propose a geometric model of\nself-assembly to describe the experimental observations in a qualitative way.\nOur study also provides some constraints for future theoretical modelling and\nsimulation.\n", "  Dust grains are an important component of the interstellar medium (ISM) of\ngalaxies. We present the first direct measurement of the residence times of\ninterstellar dust in the different ISM phases, and of the transition rates\nbetween these phases, in realistic hydrodynamical simulations of the\nmulti-phase ISM. Our simulations include a time-dependent chemical network that\nfollows the abundances of H^+, H, H_2, C^+ and CO and take into account\nself-shielding by gas and dust using a tree-based radiation transfer method.\nSupernova explosions are injected either at random locations, at density peaks,\nor as a mixture of the two. For each simulation, we investigate how matter\ncirculates between the ISM phases and find more sizeable transitions than\nconsidered in simple mass exchange schemes in the literature. The derived\nresidence times in the ISM phases are characterised by broad distributions, in\nparticular for the molecular, warm and hot medium. The most realistic\nsimulations with random and mixed driving have median residence times in the\nmolecular, cold, warm and hot phase around 17, 7, 44 and 1 Myr, respectively.\nThe transition rates measured in the random driving run are in good agreement\nwith observations of Ti gas-phase depletion in the warm and cold phases in a\nsimple depletion model, although the depletion in the molecular phase is\nunder-predicted. ISM phase definitions based on chemical abundance rather than\ntemperature cuts are physically more meaningful, but lead to significantly\ndifferent transition rates and residence times because there is no direct\ncorrespondence between the two definitions.\n", "  Stars are, generically, rotating and magnetised objects with a misalignment\nbetween their magnetic and rotation axes. Since a magnetic field induces a\npermanent distortion to its host, it provides effective rigidity even to a\nfluid star, leading to bulk stellar motion which resembles free precession.\nThis bulk motion is however accompanied by induced interior velocity and\nmagnetic field perturbations, which are oscillatory on the precession\ntimescale. Extending previous work, we show that these quantities are described\nby a set of second-order perturbation equations featuring cross-terms scaling\nwith the product of the magnetic and centrifugal distortions to the star. For\nthe case of a background toroidal field, we reduce these to a set of\ndifferential equations in radial functions, and find a method for their\nsolution. The resulting magnetic-field and velocity perturbations show complex\nmultipolar structure and are strongest towards the centre of the star.\n", "  Using the superconformal framework, we construct a new off-shell model for\n$\\cal N=4$ topologically massive supergravity which is minimal in the sense\nthat it makes use of a single compensating vector multiplet and involves no\nfree parameter. As such, it provides a counterexample to the common lore that\ntwo compensating multiplets are required within the conformal approach to\nsupergravity with eight supercharges in diverse dimensions. This theory is an\noff-shell $\\cal N=4$ supersymmetric extension of chiral gravity. All of its\nsolutions correspond to non-conformally flat superspaces. Its maximally\nsupersymmetric solutions include the so-called critical (4,0) anti-de Sitter\nsuperspace introduced in arXiv:1205.4622, and well as warped critical (4,0)\nanti-de Sitter superspaces. We also propose a dual formulation for the theory\nin which the vector multiplet is replaced with an off-shell hypermultiplet.\nUpon elimination of the auxiliary fields belonging to the hypermultiplet and\nimposing certain gauge conditions, the dual action reduces to the one\nintroduced in arXiv:1605.00103.\n", "  Activity of most comets near the Sun is dominated by sublimation of frozen\nwater, the most abundant ice in comets. Some comets, however, are active well\nbeyond the water-ice sublimation limit of ~3 AU. Three bodies dominate the\nobservational record and modeling efforts for distantly active comets: the\nlong-period comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp and the short-period comets (with Centaur\norbits) 29P/Schwassmann Wachmann 1 and 2060 Chiron. We summarize what is known\nabout these three objects emphasizing their gaseous comae. We calculate their\nCN/CO and CO2/CO production rate ratios from the literature and discuss\nimplications. Using our own data we derive CO production rates for all three\nobjects, in order to examine a correlation between gas production and different\norbital histories and/or size. We find that orbital history does not appear to\nplay a significant role in explaining 29P's CO production rates. 29P\noutproduces Hale-Bopp at the same heliocentric distance, even though it has\nbeen subjected to much more solar heating. Previous modeling work on such\nobjects predicts that 29P should have been de-volatilized over a fresher comet\nlike Hale-Bopp. This may point to 29P having a different orbital history than\ncurrent models predict, with its current orbit acquired more recently. On the\nother hand, Chiron's CO measurements are consistent with it being significantly\ndepleted over its original state, perhaps due to increased radiogenic heating\nmade possible by its much larger size or its higher processing due to orbital\nhistory. Observed spectral line profiles are consistent with development and\nsublimation of icy grains at about 5-6 AU for 29P and Hale-Bopp, and this is\nprobably a common feature in distantly active comets, and an important source\nof volatiles for all comets within 5 AU. In contrast, the narrow CO line\nprofiles indicate a nuclear, and not extended, origin for CO beyond ~4 AU.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate collective strong coupling, optical\nbi-stability (OB) and all-optical switching in a system consisting of ultracold\n85Rb atoms, trapped in a dark magneto-optical trap (DMOT), coupled to an\noptical Fabry-Perot cavity. The strong coupling is established by measuring the\nvacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) of a weak on-axis probe beam. The dependence of VRS\non the probe beam power is measured and bi-stability in the cavity transmission\nis observed. We demonstrate control over the transmission of the probe beam\nthrough the atom-cavity system using a free-space off-axis control beam and\nshow that the cavity transmission can be switched on and off in micro-second\ntimescales using micro-Watt control powers. The utility of the system as a tool\nfor sensitive, in-situ and rapid measurements is envisaged.\n", "  We study the effects of heavy fields on 4D spacetimes with flat, de Sitter\nand anti-de Sitter asymptotics. At low energies, matter generates specific,\ncalculable higher derivative corrections to the GR action which perturbatively\nalter the Schwarzschild-$(A)dS$ family of solutions. The effects of massive\nscalars, Dirac spinors and gauge fields are each considered. The six-derivative\noperators they produce, such as $\\sim R^{3}$ terms, generate the leading\ncorrections. The induced changes to horizon radii, Hawking temperatures and\nentropies are found. Modifications to the energy of large $AdS$ black holes are\nderived by imposing the first law. An explicit demonstration of the replica\ntrick is provided, as it is used to derive black hole and cosmological horizon\nentropies. Considering entropy bounds, it's found that scalars and fermions\nincrease the entropy one can store inside a region bounded by a sphere of fixed\nsize, but vectors lead to a decrease, oddly. We also demonstrate, however, that\nmany of the corrections fall below the resolving power of the effective field\ntheory and are therefore untrustworthy. Defining properties of black holes,\nsuch as the horizon area and Hawking temperature, prove to be remarkably robust\nagainst higher derivative gravitational corrections.\n", "  In this paper we present some new equations which we call Yang-Mills-Proca\nequations (or generalized Proca equations). This system of equations is a\ngeneralization of Proca equation and Yang-Mills equations and it is not gauge\ninvariant. We present a number of constant solutions of this system of\nequations in the case of arbitrary Lie algebra. In details we consider the case\nwhen this Lie algebra is Clifford algebra or Grassmann algebra. We consider\nsolutions of Yang-Mills equations in the form of perturbation theory series\nnear the constant solution.\n", "  Tractors and Twistors bundles both provide natural conformally covariant\ncalculi on $4D$-Riemannian manifolds. They have different origins but are\nclosely related, and usually constructed bottom-up through prolongation of\ndefining differential equations. We propose alternative top-down gauge\ntheoretic constructions, starting from the conformal Cartan bundle $\\P$ and its\nvectorial $E$ and spinorial $\\sE$ associated bundles. Our key ingredient is the\ndressing field method of gauge symmetry reduction, which allows to exhibit\ntractors and twistors and their associated connections as gauge fields of a\nnon-standard kind as far as Weyl rescaling symmetry is concerned. By\n\\emph{non-standard} we mean that they implement the gauge principle of physics,\nbut are of a different geometric nature than the well known differential\ngeometric objects usually underlying gauge theories. We provide the\ncorresponding BRST treatment. In a companion paper we dealt with tractors, in\nthe present one we address the case of twistors.\n", "  We present the on-shell double copy dictionary for linearised ${\\mathcal\nN}=2$ supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of vector multiplets in four\ndimensions. Subsequently, we use it to construct a double copy description of\nmulti-centered BPS black hole solutions in these theories in the weak-field\napproximation.\n", "  The present paper is devoted to a theoretical analysis of sliding friction\nunder the influence of oscillations perpendicular to the sliding plane. In\ncontrast to previous works we analyze the influence of the stiffness of the\ntribological contact in detail and also consider the case of large oscillation\namplitudes at which the contact is lost during a part of the oscillation\nperiod, so that the sample starts to \"jump\". It is shown that the macroscopic\ncoefficient of friction is a function of only two dimensionless parameters - a\ndimensionless sliding velocity and dimensionless oscillation amplitude. This\nfunction in turn depends on the shape of the contacting bodies. In the present\npaper, analysis is carried out for two shapes: a flat cylindrical punch and a\nparabolic shape. Here we consider \"stiff systems\", where the contact stiffness\nis small compared with the stiffness of the system. The role of the system\nstiffness will be studied in more detail in a separate paper.\n", "  We calculate the probability distribution of entanglement entropy S across a\ncut of a finite one dimensional spin chain of length L at an infinite\nrandomness fixed point using Fisher's strong randomness renormalization group\n(RG). Using the random transverse-field Ising model as an example, the\ndistribution is shown to take the form $p(S|L) \\sim L^{-\\psi(k)}$, where $k = S\n/ \\log [L/L_0]$, the large deviation function $\\psi(k)$ is found explicitly,\nand $L_0$ is a nonuniversal microscopic length. We discuss the implications of\nsuch a distribution on numerical techniques that rely on entanglement, such as\nmatrix product state (MPS) based techniques. Our results are verified with\nnumerical RG simulations, as well as the actual entanglement entropy\ndistribution for the random transverse-field Ising model which we calculate for\nlarge L via a mapping to Majorana fermions.\n", "  We present the first exploration of relativistic gas dynamics in the\nimmediate vicinity of binary black holes as the system inspirals close to\nmerger in the gravitational radiation-driven regime. We focus on 2D\nhydrodynamical studies of comparable-mass, non-spinning systems. Relativistic\neffects alter the dynamics of gas in this environment in several ways. Because\nthe gravitational potential between the two black holes becomes shallower than\nin the Newtonian regime, the mini-disks stretch toward the L1 point and the\namount of gas passing back and forth between the mini-disks increases sharply\nwith decreasing binary separation. This \"sloshing\" is quasi-periodically\nmodulated at $2$ and $2.75$ times the binary orbital frequency, corresponding\nto timescales of hours to days for supermassive binary black holes. In\naddition, relativistic effects add an $m=1$ component to the tidally-driven\nspiral waves in the disks that are purely $m=2$ in Newtonian gravity; this\ncomponent becomes dominant when the separation is $\\lesssim 100$ gravitational\nradii. Both the sloshing and the spiral waves have the potential to create\ndistinctive radiation features that may uniquely mark supermassive binary black\nholes in the relativistic regime.\n", "  The effect of the Earth's gravitational potential on a quantum wave function\nhas only been observed for massive particles. In this paper we present a scheme\nto measure a gravitationally induced phase shift on a single photon travelling\nin a coherent superposition along different paths of an optical fiber\ninterferometer. To create a measurable signal for the interaction between the\nstatic gravitational potential and the wave function of the photon, we propose\na variant of a conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We show that the\npredicted relative phase difference of $10^{-5}$ radians is measurable even in\nthe presence of fiber noise, provided additional stabilization techniques are\nimplemented for each arm of a large-scale fiber interferometer. Effects arising\nfrom the rotation of the Earth and the material properties of the fibers are\nanalysed. We conclude that optical fiber interferometry is a feasible way to\nmeasure the gravitationally induced phase shift on a single-photon wave\nfunction, and thus provides a means to corroborate the equivalence of the\nenergy of the photon and its effective gravitational mass.\n", "  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer-scale high-energy\nneutrino detector built into the ice at the South Pole. Construction of\nIceCube, the largest neutrino detector built to date, was completed in 2011 and\nenabled the discovery of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. We describe here\nthe design, production, and calibration of the IceCube digital optical module\n(DOM), the cable systems, computing hardware, and our methodology for drilling\nand deployment. We also describe the online triggering and data filtering\nsystems that select candidate neutrino and cosmic ray events for analysis. Due\nto a rigorous pre-deployment protocol, 98.4% of the DOMs in the deep ice are\noperating and collecting data. IceCube routinely achieves a detector uptime of\n99% by emphasizing software stability and monitoring. Detector operations have\nbeen stable since construction was completed, and the detector is expected to\noperate at least until the end of the next decade.\n", "  The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the most famous problems in graph\ntheory. However, little is currently known about the extent to which quantum\ncomputers could speed up algorithms for the problem. In this paper, we prove a\nquadratic quantum speedup when the degree of each vertex is at most 3 by\napplying a quantum backtracking algorithm to a classical algorithm by Xiao and\nNagamochi. We then use similar techniques to accelerate a classical algorithm\nfor when the degree of each vertex is at most 4, before speeding up\nhigher-degree graphs via reductions to these instances.\n", "  We formulate a general family of entanglement criteria for multipartite\nsystems. Fisher information criteria compare the sensitivity to unitary\nrotations with the variances of suitable local observables. Generalized\nsqueezing-type criteria provide lower bounds that are less stringent but only\nrequire measurements of second moments. The enhancement due to local access to\nthe individual subsystems is studied in detail for the case of $N$ spin-$1/2$\nparticles. The discussed techniques can be readily implemented in current\nexperiments with trapped ions in Paul traps and neutral atoms in optical\nlattices.\n", "  We investigate the early-time accelerated universe after the Big Bang. We pay\nattention to the dissipative properties of the inflationary universe in the\npresence of a soft type singularity, making use of the parameters of the\ngeneralized equation of state of the fluid. Flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nmetric is being used. We consider cosmological models leading to the so-called\ntype IV singular inflation. Our obtained theoretical results are compared with\nobservational data from the Planck satellite. The theoretical predictions for\nthe spectral index turn out to be in agreement with the data, while for the\nscalar-to tensor ratio there are minor deviations.\n", "  We examined the lane formation dynamics of oppositely self-driven binary\nparticles by molecular dynamics simulations of a two-dimensional system. Our\nstudy comprehensively revealed the effects of the density and system size on\nthe lane formation. The phase diagram distinguishing the no-lane and lane\nstates was systematically determined for various combinations of the\nanisotropic friction coefficient and the desired velocity. A peculiar clustered\nstructure was observed when the lane was destroyed by greatly increasing the\ndesired velocity. A strong system size effect was demonstrated by the\nrelationship between the temporal and spatial scales of the lane structure.\nThis system size effect can be attributed to an analogy with the driven lattice\ngas. The transport efficiency was characterized from the scaling relation in\nterms of the degree of lane formation and the interface thickness between\ndifferent lanes.\n", "  By using Lie symmetry methods, we identify a class of second order nonlinear\nordinary differential equations invariant under at least one dimensional\nsubgroup of the symmetry group of the Ermakov-Pinney equation. In this context,\nnonlinear superposition rule for second order Kummer-Schwarz equation is\nrediscovered. Invariance under one-dimensional symmetry group is also used to\nobtain first integrals (Ermakov-Lewis invariants). Our motivation is a type of\nequations with singular term that arises in many applications, in particular in\nthe study of general NLS (nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger) equations.\n", "  We study nonlinear mixing effects among quadrupole modes and scissors modes\nin a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. Using a perturbative\ntechnique in conjunction with a variational approach with a Gaussian trial wave\nfunction for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we find that mode mixing\nselectively occurs. Our perturbative approach is useful in gaining qualitative\nunderstanding of the recent experiment [Yamazaki et al., J. Phys. Soc. Japan\n84, 44001 (2015)], exhibiting a beating phenomenon of the scissors mode as well\nas a modulation phenomenon of the low-lying quadrupole mode by the high-lying\nquadrupole mode frequency. Within the second-order treatment of the nonlinear\nmode coupling terms, our approach predicts all the spectral peaks obtained by\nthe numerical simulation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n", "  Electron-beam (e-beam) lithography is commonly used in fabricating\nmetal-oxide-silicon (MOS) quantum devices but creates defects at the Si/SiO$_2$\ninterface. Here we show that a forming gas anneal is effective at removing\nshallow defects ($\\leq$ 4 meV below the conduction band edge) created by an\ne-beam exposure by measuring the density of shallow electron traps in two sets\nof high-mobility MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). One set was irradiated\nwith an electron-beam (10 keV, 40 $\\mu$C/cm$^2$) and was subsequently annealed\nin forming gas while the other set remained unexposed. Low temperature (335 mK)\ntransport measurements indicate that the forming gas anneal recovers the e-beam\nexposed sample's peak mobility (14,000 cm$^2$/Vs) to within a factor of two of\nthe unexposed sample's mobility (23,000 cm$^2$/Vs). Using electron spin\nresonance (ESR) to measure the density of shallow traps, we find that the two\nsets of devices are nearly identical, indicating the forming gas anneal is\nsufficient to anneal out shallow defects generated by the e-beam exposure.\nFitting the two sets of devices' transport data to a percolation transition\nmodel, we extract a T=0 percolation threshold density in quantitative agreement\nwith our lowest temperature ESR-measured trap densities.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the hadronic loop contributions to the\n$\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{bJ} \\phi~(J=0,1,2)$ along with $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to\n\\chi_{bJ} \\omega~(J=0,1,2)$ transitions. We predict that the branching ratios\nof $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\phi$, $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1} \\phi$ and\n$\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2} \\phi$ are $(0.68 \\sim 4.62) \\times 10^{-6}$, $(0.50\n\\sim 3.43) \\times 10^{-6}$ and $(2.22 \\sim 15.18) \\times 10^{-6}$, respectively\nand those of $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\omega$, $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1}\n\\omega$ and $\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2} \\omega$ are $(0.15 \\sim 2.81) \\times\n10^{-3}$, $(0.63 \\sim 11.68) \\times 10^{-3}$ and $(1.08 \\sim 20.02) \\times\n10^{-3}$, respectively. Especially, some typical ratios, which reflect the\nrelative magnitudes of the predicted branching ratios, are given, i.e., for\n$\\Upsilon(6S)\\to \\chi_{bJ}\\phi$ transitions,\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\phi_{10}={\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1}\n\\phi]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\phi]} \\approx 0.74$,\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\phi_{20}= {\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2}\n\\phi]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\phi]} \\approx 3.28$, and\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\phi_{21} = {\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2}\n\\phi]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1} \\phi]} \\approx 4.43$, and for\n$\\Upsilon(6S)\\to \\chi_{bJ}\\omega$ transitions,\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\omega_{10}={\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1}\n\\omega]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\omega]} \\approx 4.11$,\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\omega_{20}= {\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2}\n\\omega]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b0} \\omega]} \\approx 7.06$, and\n$\\mathcal{R}^\\omega_{21} = {\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b2}\n\\omega]}/{\\mathcal{B}[\\Upsilon(6S) \\to \\chi_{b1} \\omega]} \\approx 1.72$. With\nthe running of BelleII in the near future, experimental measurement of these\ntwo kinds of transitions will be a potential research issue.\n", "  We present a first-principles-based many-body typical medium dynamical\ncluster approximation method for characterizing electron localization in\ndisordered structures. This method applied to monolayer hexagonal boron nitride\nshows that the presence of a boron vacancies could turn this wide-gap insulator\ninto a correlated metal. Depending on the strength of the electron\ninteractions, these calculations suggest that conduction could be obtained at a\nboron vacancy concentration as low as $1.0\\%$. We also explore the distribution\nof the local density of states, a fingerprint of spatial variations, which\nallows localized and delocalized states to be distinguished. The presented\nmethod enables the study of disorder-driven insulator-metal transitions not\nonly in $h$-BN but also in other physical materials.\n", "  Gas-solid multiphase flows are prone to develop an instability known as\nclustering. Two-fluid models, which treat the particulate phase as a continuum,\nare known to reproduce the qualitative features of this instability, producing\nhighly-dynamic, spatiotemporal patterns. However, it is unknown whether such\nsimulations are truly aperiodic or a type of complex periodic behavior. By\nshowing that the system possesses a sensitive dependence on initial conditions\nand a positive largest Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda_1 \\approx 1/\\tau$, we\nprovide a tentative answer: continuum predictions of clustering are chaotic. We\nfurther demonstrate that the chaotic behavior is dimensionally dependent, a\nconclusion which unifies previous results and strongly suggests that the\nchaotic behavior is not a result of the fundamental kinematic instability, but\nof the secondary (inherently multidimensional) instability.\n", "  We determine effective collisional radii of positronium (Ps) by considering\nPs states in hard-wall spherical cavities. $B$-spline basis sets of electron\nand positron states inside the cavity are used to construct the states of Ps.\nAccurate Ps energy eigenvalues are obtained by extrapolation with respect to\nthe numbers of partial waves and radial states included in the bases.\nComparison of the extrapolated energies with those of a pointlike particle\nprovides values of the effective radius $\\rho_{nl}$ of Ps($nl$) in collisions\nwith a hard wall. We show that for $1s$, $2s$, and $2p$ states of Ps, the\neffective radius decreases with the increasing Ps center-of-mass momentum, and\nfind $\\rho_{1s}=1.65$ a.u., $\\rho_{2s}=7.00$ a.u., and $\\rho_{2p}=5.35$ a.u. in\nthe zero-momentum limit.\n", "  A class of generalized Galileon cosmological models, which can be described\nby a point-like Lagrangian, is considered in order to utilize Noether's Theorem\nto determine conservation laws for the field equations. In the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe, the existence of a nontrivial\nconservation law indicates the integrability of the field equations. Due to the\ncomplexity of the latter, we apply the differential invariants approach in\norder to construct special power-law solutions and study their stability.\n", "  The interplay between geometric frustration (GF) and bond disorder is studied\nin the Ising kagome lattice within a cluster approach. The model considers\nantiferromagnetic (AF) short-range couplings and long-range intercluster\ndisordered interactions. The replica formalism is used to obtain an effective\nsingle cluster model from where the thermodynamics is analyzed by exact\ndiagonalization. We found that the presence of GF can introduce cluster\nfreezing at very low levels of disorder. The system exhibits an entropy plateau\nfollowed by a large entropy drop close to the freezing temperature. In this\nscenario, a spin-liquid (SL) behavior prevents conventional long-range order,\nbut an infinitesimal disorder picks out uncompensated cluster states from the\nmulti degenerate SL regime, potentializing the intercluster disordered coupling\nand bringing the cluster spin-glass state. To summarize, our results suggest\nthat the SL state combined with low levels of disorder can activate small\nclusters, providing hypersensitivity to the freezing process in geometrically\nfrustrated materials and playing a key role in the glassy stabilization. We\npropose that this physical mechanism could be present in several geometrically\nfrustrated materials. In particular, we discuss our results in connection to\nthe recent experimental investigations of the Ising kagome compound\nCo$_3$Mg(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$.\n", "  A new table of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) based on realistic nuclear\npotentials is constructed for core-collapse supernova numerical simulations.\nAdopting the EOS of uniform nuclear matter constructed by two of the present\nauthors with the cluster variational method starting from the Argonne v18 and\nUrbana IX nuclear potentials, the Thomas-Fermi calculation is performed to\nobtain the minimized free energy of a Wigner-Seitz cell in non-uniform nuclear\nmatter. As a preparation for the Thomas-Fermi calculation, the EOS of uniform\nnuclear matter is modified so as to remove the effects of deuteron cluster\nformation in uniform matter at low densities. Mixing of alpha particles is also\ntaken into account following the procedure used by Shen et al. (1998, 2011).\nThe critical densities with respect to the phase transition from non-uniform to\nuniform phase with the present EOS are slightly higher than those with the Shen\nEOS at small proton fractions. The critical temperature with respect to the\nliquid-gas phase transition decreases with the proton fraction in a more\ngradual manner than in the Shen EOS. Furthermore, the mass and proton numbers\nof nuclides appearing in non-uniform nuclear matter with small proton fractions\nare larger than those of the Shen EOS. These results are consequences of the\nfact that the density derivative coefficient of the symmetry energy of our EOS\nis smaller than that of the Shen EOS.\n", "  Accurate measurement of galaxy structures is a prerequisite for quantitative\ninvestigation of galaxy properties or evolution. Yet, the impact of galaxy\ninclination and dust on commonly used metrics of galaxy structure is poorly\nquantified. We use infrared data sets to select inclination-independent samples\nof disc and flattened elliptical galaxies. These samples show strong variation\nin S\\'{e}rsic index, concentration, and half-light radii with inclination. We\ndevelop novel inclination-independent galaxy structures by collapsing the light\ndistribution in the near-infrared on to the major axis, yielding\ninclination-independent `linear' measures of size and concentration. With these\nnew metrics we select a sample of Milky Way analogue galaxies with similar\nstellar masses, star formation rates, sizes and concentrations. Optical\nluminosities, light distributions, and spectral properties are all found to\nvary strongly with inclination: When inclining to edge-on, $r$-band\nluminosities dim by $>$1 magnitude, sizes decrease by a factor of 2,\n`dust-corrected' estimates of star formation rate drop threefold, metallicities\ndecrease by 0.1 dex, and edge-on galaxies are half as likely to be classified\nas star forming. These systematic effects should be accounted for in analyses\nof galaxy properties.\n", "  We present auto and hetero B\\\"acklund transformations of the nonholonomic\nVeselova system using standard divisor arithmetic on the hyperelliptic curve of\ngenus two. As a by-product one gets two natural integrable systems on the\ncotangent bundle to the unit two-dimensional sphere whose additional integrals\nof motion are polynomials in the momenta of fourth order.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy of graphene is reviewed from a theoretical perspective.\nAfter an introduction of the building blocks (electronic band structure, phonon\ndispersion, electron-phonon interaction, electron-light coupling), Raman\nintensities are calculated using time-dependent perturbation theory. The\nanalysis of the contributing terms allows for an intuitive understanding of the\nRaman peak positions and intensities. The Raman spectrum of pure graphene only\ndisplays two principle peaks. Yet, their variation as a function of internal\nand external parameters and the occurrence of secondary, defect-related peaks,\nconveys a lot of information about the system. Thus, Raman spectroscopy is used\nroutinely to analyze layer number, defects, doping and strain of graphene\nsamples. At the same time, it is an intriguing playground to study the optical\nproperties of graphene.\n", "  We show that some statistical properties of forced two-dimensional turbulence\nhave an important sensitivity to the form of large-scale dissipation which is\nrequired to damp the inverse cascade. We consider three models of large-scale\ndissipation: linear \"Ekman\" drag, non-linear quadratic drag, and scale\nselective hypo-drag that damps only low-wavenumber modes. In all cases, the\nstatistically steady vorticity field is dominated by almost axisymmetric\nvortices, and the probability density function of vorticity is non-Gaussian.\nHowever, in the case of linear and quadratic drag, we find that the velocity\nstatistics is close to Gaussian, with non-negligible contribution coming from\nthe background turbulent flow. On the other hand, with hypo-drag, the\nprobability density function of velocity is non-Gaussian and is predominantly\ndetermined by the properties of the vortices. With hypo-drag, the relative\npositions of the vortices and the exponential distribution of the vortex\nextremum are important factors responsible for the non-Gaussian velocity\nstatistics.\n", "  We present here in full detail the evolution of the angular momentum deficit\n(AMD) during collisions as it was described in (Laskar, PRL,2000). Since then,\nthe AMD has been revealed to be a key parameter for the understanding of the\noutcome of planetary formation models. We define here the AMD-stability\ncriterion that can be easily verified on a newly discovered planetary system.\nWe show how AMD-stability can be used to establish a classification of the\nmultiplanet systems in order to exhibit the planetary systems that are\nlong-term stable because they are AMD-stable, and those that are AMD-unstable\nwhich then require some additional dynamical studies to conclude on their\nstability. The AMD-stability classification is applied to the 131 multiplanet\nsystems from The Extrasolar Planet Encyclopaedia database (exoplanet.eu) for\nwhich the orbital elements are sufficiently well known.\n", "  A heat exchange interface at subzero temperature in a water vapor\nenvironment, exhibits high probability of frost formation due to freezing\ncondensation, a factor that markedly decreases the heat transfer efficacy due\nto the considerable thermal resistance of ice. Here we report a novel strategy\nto delay ice nucleation on these types of solid-water vapor interfaces. With a\nprocess-driven mechanism, a self-generated liquid intervening layer immiscible\nto water, is deposited on a textured superhydrophobic surface and acts as a\nbarrier between the water vapor and the solid substrate. This liquid layer\nimparts remarkable slippery conditions resulting in high mobility of condensing\nwater droplets. A large increase of the ensuing ice coverage time is shown\ncompared to the cases of standard smooth hydrophilic or textured\nsuperhydrophobic surfaces. During deicing of these self-impregnating surfaces\nwe show an impressive tendency of ice fragments to skate expediting defrosting.\nRobustness of such surfaces is also demonstrated by operating them under\nsubcooling for at least 490hr without a marked degradation. This is attributed\nto the presence of the liquid intervening layer, which protects the substrate\nfrom hydrolyzation enhancing longevity and sustaining heat transfer efficiency.\n", "  In online discussion communities, users can interact and share information\nand opinions on a wide variety of topics. However, some users may create\nmultiple identities, or sockpuppets, and engage in undesired behavior by\ndeceiving others or manipulating discussions. In this work, we study\nsockpuppetry across nine discussion communities, and show that sockpuppets\ndiffer from ordinary users in terms of their posting behavior, linguistic\ntraits, as well as social network structure. Sockpuppets tend to start fewer\ndiscussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as \"I\", and\nhave more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of sockpuppets controlled by\nthe same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the\nsame time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of\ndeceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of sockpuppets can vary in\ntheir deceptiveness, i.e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their\nsupportiveness, i.e., if they support arguments of other sockpuppets controlled\nby the same user. We apply these findings to a series of prediction tasks,\nnotably, to identify whether a pair of accounts belongs to the same underlying\nuser or not. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of deception in\nonline discussion communities and paves the way towards the automatic detection\nof sockpuppets.\n", "  The search for fast optical transients, such as the expected electromagnetic\ncounterparts to binary neutron star mergers, is riddled with false positives\nranging from asteroids to stellar flares. While moving objects are readily\nrejected via image pairs separated by $\\sim$1 hr, stellar flares represent a\nchallenging foreground that significantly outnumber rapidly-evolving\nexplosions. Identifying stellar sources close to and fainter than the transient\ndetection limit can eliminate these false positives. Here, we present a method\nto reliably identify stars in deep co-adds of Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)\nimaging. Our machine-learning methodology utilizes the random forest (RF)\nalgorithm, which is trained using $> 3\\times{10}^6$ sources with Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) spectra. When evaluated on an independent test set, the PTF\nRF model outperforms the SExtractor star classifier by $\\sim$4%. For faint\nsources ($r'\\ge{21}$ mag), which dominate the field population, the PTF RF\nmodel produces a $\\sim$19% improvement over SExtractor. To avoid false\nnegatives in the PTF transient-candidate stream, we adopt a conservative\nstellar classification threshold, corresponding to a galaxy misclassification\nrate = 0.005. Ultimately, $\\sim$$1.70\\times{10}^8$ objects are included in our\nPTF point-source catalog, of which only $\\sim$$10^6$ are expected to be\ngalaxies. We demonstrate that the PTF RF catalog reveals transients that\notherwise would have been missed. To leverage its superior image quality, we\nadditionally create an SDSS point-source catalog, which is also tuned to have a\ngalaxy misclassification rate = 0.005. These catalogs have been incorporated\ninto the PTF real-time pipelines to automatically reject stellar sources as\nnon-extragalactic transients.\n", "  The most critical time for information to spread is in the aftermath of a\nserious emergency, crisis, or disaster. Individuals affected by such situations\ncan now turn to an array of communication channels, from mobile phone calls and\ntext messages to social media posts, when alerting social ties. These channels\ndrastically improve the speed of information in a time-sensitive event, and\nprovide extant records of human dynamics during and afterward the event.\nRetrospective analysis of such anomalous events provides researchers with a\nclass of \"found experiments\" that may be used to better understand social\nspreading. In this chapter, we study information spreading due to a number of\nemergency events, including the Boston Marathon Bombing and a plane crash at a\nwestern European airport. We also contrast the different information which may\nbe gleaned by social media data compared with mobile phone data and we estimate\nthe rate of anomalous events in a mobile phone dataset using a proposed anomaly\ndetection method.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems exhibit phenomena that are qualitatively different from\nthose of Hermitian systems and have been exploited to achieve a number of ends,\nincluding the generation of exceptional points, nonreciprocal dynamics,\nnon-orthogonal normal modes, and topological operations. However to date these\neffects have only been accessible with nearly-degenerate modes (i.e., modes\nwith frequency difference comparable to their linewidth and coupling rate).\nHere we demonstrate an optomechanical scheme that extends topological control\nto highly non-degenerate modes of a non-Hermitian system. Specifically, we\ninduce a \"virtual exceptional point\" between two mechanical modes whose\nfrequencies differ by >10^3 times their linewidth and coupling rate, and use\nadiabatic topological operations to transfer energy between these modes. This\nscheme can be readily implemented in many physical systems, potentially\nextending the utility of non-Hermitian dynamics to a much wider range of\nsettings.\n", "  We describe a simple experiment involving spheres rolling down an inclined\nplane towards a bottleneck and through a gap. Results of the experiment\nindicate that flow rate can be increased by placing an obstruction at optimal\npositions near the bottleneck. We use the experiment to develop a computer\nsimulation using the PhysX physics engine. Simulations confirm the experimental\nresults and we state several considerations necessary to obtain a model that\nagrees well with experiment. We demonstrate that the model exhibits clogging,\nintermittent and continuous flow, and that it can be used as a tool for further\ninvestigations in granular flow.\n", "  This is the introductory Chapter in the monograph Loop Quantum Gravity: The\nFirst 30 Years, edited by the authors, that was just published in the series\n\"100 Years of General Relativity. The 8 invited Chapters that follow provide\nfresh perspectives on the current status of the field from some of the younger\nand most active leaders who are currently shaping its development. The purpose\nof this Chapter is to provide a global overview by bridging the material\ncovered in subsequent Chapters. The goal and scope of the monograph is\ndescribed in the Preface which can be read by following the Front Matter link\nat the website listed below.\n", "  The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) at NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter is a multi-agency partnership to enable, support and perform research\nand development for next-generation space science and space weather models.\nCCMC currently hosts nearly 100 numerical models and a cornerstone of this\nactivity is the Runs on Request (RoR) system which allows anyone to request a\nmodel run and analyze/visualize the results via a web browser. CCMC is also\nactive in the education community by organizing student research contests,\nheliophysics summer schools, and space weather forecaster training for\nstudents, government and industry representatives.\n  We present a generic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model - PAMHD - that has been\nadded to the CCMC RoR system which allows the study of a variety of fluid and\nplasma phenomena in one, two and three dimensions using a dynamic\npoint-and-click web interface. Flexible initial and boundary conditions allow\nexperimentation with a variety of plasma physics problems such as shocks,\ninstabilities, planetary magnetospheres and astrophysical systems.\nExperimentation with numerical effects, e.g. resolution, solution method and\nboundary conditions, is also possible and can provide valuable context for\nspace weather forecasters when interpreting observations or modeling results.\n  We present an overview of the C++ implementation and show example results\nobtained through the CCMC RoR system, including the first to our knowledge MHD\nsimulation of the interaction of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn in\ntwo dimensions.\n", "  Object This study proposes a scale space based algorithm for automated\nsegmentation of single-shot tagged images of modest SNR. Furthermore the\nalgorithm was designed for analysis of discontinuous or shearing types of\nmotion, i.e. segmentation of broken tag patterns.\n  Materials and methods The proposed algorithm utilizes non-linear scale space\nfor automatic segmentation of single-shot tagged images. The algorithm's\nability to automatically segment tagged shearing motion was evaluated in a\nnumerical simulation and in vivo. A typical shearing deformation was simulated\nin a Shepp-Logan phantom allowing for quantitative evaluation of the\nalgorithm's success rate as a function of both SNR and the amount of\ndeformation. For a qualitative in vivo evaluation tagged images showing\ndeformations in the calf muscles and eye movement in a healthy volunteer were\nacquired.\n  Results Both the numerical simulation and the in vivo tagged data\ndemonstrated the algorithm's ability for automated segmentation of single-shot\ntagged MR provided that SNR of the images is above 10 and the amount of\ndeformation does not exceed the tag spacing. The latter constraint can be met\nby adjusting the tag delay or the tag spacing.\n  Conclusion The scale space based algorithm for automatic segmentation of\nsingle-shot tagged MR enables the application of tagged MR to complex\n(shearing) deformation and the processing of datasets with relatively low SNR.\n", "  The dynamics of a three-dimensional axisymmetric bluff-body wake are examined\nat low Reynolds regimes where transitions take place through spatio-temporal\nsymmetry breaking. A linear stability analysis is employed to identify the\ncritical Reynolds number associated with symmetry breaking, and the associated\neigenmodes, known as global modes. The analysis shows that the axisymmetric\nstable base flow breaks the rotational symmetry through a pitchfork $m=1$\nbifurcation, in agreement with previously reported results for axisymmetric\nwakes. Above this threshold, the stable base flow is steady and\nthree-dimensional with planar symmetry. A three-dimensional global stability\nanalysis around the steady reflectionally symmetric base flow, assuming no\nhomogeneous directions, predicts accurately the Hopf bifurcation threshold,\nwhich leads to asymmetric vortex shedding. DNS simulations validate the\nstability results and characterize the flow topology during the early chaotic\nregime.\n", "  In this note we give an explicit formula for the wave equation associated to\nthe Schrodinger operator with a Liouville Potential with applications to the\ntelegraph equation as well as the wave equation on the hyperbolic plane\n", "  We designed spongy monoliths allowing liquid delivery to their surfaces\nthrough continuous nanopore systems (mean pore diameter ca. 40 nm). These\nnanoporous monoliths were flat or patterned with microspherical structures a\nfew 10 microns in diameter, and their surfaces consisted of aprotic polymer or\nof TiO2 coatings. Liquid may reduce adhesion forces FAd; possible reasons\ninclude screening of solid-solid interactions and poroelastic effects.\nSoftening-induced deformation of flat polymeric monoliths upon contact\nformation in the presence of liquids enhanced the work of separation WSe. On\nflat TiO2-coated monoliths, WSe was under wet conditions smaller than under dry\nconditions, possibly because of liquid-induced screening of solid-solid\ninteractions. Under dry conditions, WSe is larger on flat TiO2-coated monoliths\nthan on flat monoliths with polymeric surface. However, under wet conditions\nliquid-induced softening results in larger WSe on flat monoliths with polymeric\nsurface than on flat monoliths with oxidic surface. Monolithic microsphere\narrays show anti-adhesive properties; FAd and WSe are reduced by at least one\norder of magnitude as compared to flat nanoporous counterparts. On nanoporous\nmonolithic microsphere arrays, capillarity (WSe is larger under wet than under\ndry conditions) and solid-solid interactions (WSe is larger on oxide than on\npolymer) dominate contact mechanics. Thus, the microsphere topography reduces\nthe impact of softening-induced surface deformation and screening of\nsolid-solid interactions associated with liquid supply. Overall, simple\nmodifications of surface topography and chemistry combined with delivery of\nliquid to the contact interface allow adjusting WSe and FAd over at least one\norder of magnitude. (...)\n", "  We theoretically discuss the physical origin of the dielectric constants\n[{\\epsilon}({\\omega})] and second harmonic generation coefficients\n[\\{chi}(2)({\\omega})] of the ABA-stacked two-dimensional graphene-like silicon\ncarbide (2D-SiC) with the number of layers up to 5. It is found that the\nintensities of the pronounced peaks of both {\\epsilon}({\\omega}) and\n\\{chi}(2)({\\omega}) exhibit a clear layer number dependence. For the light\npolarization parallel to the 2DSiC plane, the monolayer SiC (ML-SiC) and\nmultilayer SiC (MuL-SiC) have very similar pronounced peak positions of\n{\\epsilon}({\\omega}), which are attributed to the {\\pi}->{\\pi}* and\n{\\sigma}->{\\sigma}* transitions. However, for the light polarization\nperpendicular to the 2D-SiC plane, a characteristic peak is found for the\nMuL-SiC at about 4.0 eV, except that the allowed {\\pi}->{\\sigma}* and\n{\\sigma}->{\\pi}* transition peaks are found for both ML-SiC and MuL-SiC in the\nhigh-energy region (> 8 eV). This characteristic peak is attributed to the\ninterlayer {\\pi}->{\\pi}* transition which does not exist for the ML-SiC, and at\nthis peak position, the ML-SiC has a weak dark exciton based on the mBJ\ncalculation within the Bethe-Salpeter equation framework. For\n\\{chi}(2)({\\omega}), the single-particle transition channels based on the\nthree-band terms dominate the second harmonic generation process of both ML-SiC\nand MuL-SiC and determine the size and sign of \\{chi}(2)({\\omega}). In the\nultraviolet visible region, the purely interband motion and intraband motion of\nelectrons competitively determine the size and sign of \\{chi}(2)({\\omega}). For\nthe light polarization perpendicular to the 2D-SiC plane, the intraband motion\nof electrons modulated more dramatically the interband motion than for that\nparallel to the 2D-SiC plane.\n", "  In this paper, we study traveling wave solutions and peakon weak solutions of\nthe modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with dispersive term $2ku_x$ for\n$k\\in\\mathbb{R}$. We study traveling wave solutions through a Hamiltonian\nsystem obtained from the mCH equation by using a nonlinear transformation. The\ntypical traveling wave solutions given by this Hamiltonian system are unbounded\nor multi-valued. We provide a method, called patching technic, to truncate\nthese traveling wave solutions and patch different segments to obtain patched\nbounded single-valued peakon weak solutions which satisfy jump conditions at\npeakons. Then, we study some special peakon weak solutions constructed by the\nfundamental solution of the Helmholtz operator $1-\\partial_{xx}$, which can\nalso be obtained by the patching technic. At last, we study some length and\ntotal signed area preserving closed planar curve flows that can be described by\nthe mCH equation when $k=1$, for which we give a Hamiltonian structure and use\nthe patched periodic peakon weak solutions to investigate loops with cusps.\n", "  The physical mechanism of the oriented shift and inverse of eccentric\nglobules in a modest extensional flow are investigated in this paper. Through\nthis work, a shift of the globule, which is driven mainly by the asymmetric\ninterfacial curvature, not by the outer drag, is disclosed. The asymmetric\nlayout of the daughter droplet leads to the asymmetric drags from the\ncontinuous phase and the asymmetric deformation of the globule with different\ninterface curvatures. As the inner droplet has both enhancing and suppressing\neffect on the globule deformation, the interface curvatures will vary when\nchanging the relative size and location of the inner droplet. This curvature\ndifference results in the asymmetric pressure distribution and circulation\ninside the globule. Eventually, the interaction of the inner driving force\n(pressure differences) and the outer drags causes the oriented shift and\ninverse of the globule. The shift direction is affected not only by the\nstructural asymmetry parameter (eccentricity), but also by some flow features\nsuch as the capillary number. The results obtained here might enlighten\npotential applications for the movement of soft globules driven by curvature\ndifferences.\n", "  Recent experiments have highlighted the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy in\ncoil-coil diblock copolymers, specifically in poly(styrene-b-4-vinylpyridine)\n(PS-b-P4VP), that enables magnetic field alignment at field strengths of a few\ntesla. We consider here the alignment response of two low molecular weight (MW)\nlamallae-forming PS-b-P4VP systems. Cooling across the disorder-order\ntransition temperature ($\\mathrm{T_{odt}}$) results in strong alignment for the\nhigher MW sample (5.5K), whereas little alignment is discernible for the lower\nMW system (3.6K). This disparity under otherwise identical conditions of field\nstrength and cooling rate suggests that different average grain sizes are\nproduced during slow cooling of these materials, with larger grains formed in\nthe higher MW material. Blending the block copolymers results in homogeneous\nsamples which display $\\mathrm{T_{odt}}$, d-spacings and grain sizes that are\nintermediate between the two neat diblocks. Similarly, the alignment quality\ndisplays a smooth variation with the concentration of the higher MW diblock in\nthe blends and the size of grains likewise interpolates between limits set by\nthe neat diblocks, with a factor of 3.5X difference in the grain size observed\nin high vs low MW neat diblocks. These results highlight the importance of\ngrain growth kinetics in dictating the field response in block copolymers and\nsuggests an unconventional route for the manipulation of such kinetics.\n", "  Recently unusual properties of water in single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT)\nwith diameters ranging from 1.05 nm to 1.52 nm were observed. It was found that\nwater in the CNT remains in an ice-like phase even when the temperature ranges\nbetween 105 - 151 C and 87 - 117 C for CNTs with diameters 1.05 nm and 1.06 nm\nrespectively. Apart from the high freezing points, the solid-liquid phase\ntransition temperature was found to be strongly sensitive to the CNT diameter.\nIn this paper we show that water in such CNT's can admit coherent nanoscale\nstructures provided certain conditions are met. The formation of such coherent\nstructures allows for high values of solid-liquid phase transition temperatures\nthat are in qualitative agreement with the empirical data. The model also\npredicts that the phase transition temperature scales inversely with the square\nof the effective radius available for the water flow within the CNT. This is\nconsistent with the observed sensitive dependence of the solid-liquid phase\ntransition temperature on the CNT diameter.\n", "  We report the effects of heavy-ion irradiation on FeSe single crystals by\nirradiating Uranium up to a dose equivalent matching field of $B_\\phi$ = 16 T.\nAlmost continuous columnar defects along the $c$-axis with a diameter $\\sim$10\nnm are confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. $T_c$ is\nfound to be suppressed by introducing columnar defects at a rate of\nd$T_c$/d$B_\\phi$ $\\sim$ -0.29KT$^{-1}$, which is much larger than those\nobserved in iron pnictides. This unexpected large suppression of $T_c$ in FeSe\nis discussed in relation to the large diameter of the columnar defects as well\nas its unique band structure with a remarkably small Fermi energy. The critical\ncurrent density is first dramatically enhanced with irradiation reaching a\nvalue over $\\sim$2$\\times$10$^5$ A/cm$^2$ ($\\sim$5 times larger than that of\nthe pristine sample) at 2 K (self-field) with $B_\\phi$ = 2 T, then gradually\nsuppressed with increasing $B_\\phi$. The $\\delta$$l$-pinning associated with\ncharge-carrier mean free path fluctuations, and the $\\delta$$T_c$-pinning\nassociated with spatial fluctuations of the transition temperature are found to\ncoexist in the pristine FeSe, while the irradiation increases the contribution\nfrom $\\delta$$l$-pinning, and makes it dominant over $B_\\phi$ = 4 T.\n", "  We demonstrate the application of the multiplex networks-approach for the\nanalysis of various networks which connected individuals and communities in the\npolitically highly fragmented late medieval Balkans (1204-1453 AD) within and\nacross border zones. We present how we obtain relational data from our sources\nand the integration of these data into three different networks (of roads,\nstate administration and ecclesiastical administration) of various topologies;\nthen we calculate several indicators for influences and overlaps between these\ndifferent networks which connect the same set of nodes (settlements). We\nanalyse changes and continuities in the topologies of the various networks for\nthree time-steps (1210, 1324 and 1380 CE) and demonstrate the role of these\nnetworks as frameworks for social interactions. Finally, we combine all three\nnetworks into one network which shows properties observed for the small world\nmodel. Thus, we demonstrate possibilities for capturing historical complexity\nwith the help of the multiplex networks approach.\n", "  This paper is concerned with a linear fractional representation approach to\nthe synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers for a given linear quantum\nplant. The plant and controller represent open quantum harmonic oscillators and\nare modelled by linear quantum stochastic differential equations. The feedback\ninterconnections between the plant and the controller are assumed to be\nestablished through quantum bosonic fields. In this framework, conditions for\nthe stabilization of a given linear quantum plant via linear coherent quantum\nfeedback are addressed using a stable factorization approach. The class of all\nstabilizing quantum controllers is parameterized in the frequency domain.\nCoherent quantum weighted H_2 and H_\\infty control problems for linear quantum\nsystems are formulated in the frequency domain. Finally, a projected gradient\ndescent scheme is outlined for the coherent quantum weighted H_2 control\nproblem.\n", "  We develop a theory of local asymptotic normality in the quantum domain based\non a noncommutative extension of the Lebesgue decomposition. This formulation\ngives a substantial generalization of the previous paper [Yamagata, Fujiwara,\nand Gill (2013). Ann. Statist., 41, 2197-2217.], extending the scope of the\nquantum local asymptotic normality to a wider class of quantum statistical\nmodels that comprise density operators of mixed ranks.\n", "  These lectures provide an introduction to the directed percolation and\ndirected animals problems, from a physicist's point of view. The probabilistic\ncellular automaton formulation of directed percolation is introduced. The\nplanar duality of the diode-resistor-insulator percolation problem in two\ndimensions, and relation of the directed percolation to undirected first\npassage percolation problem are described. Equivalence of the $d$-dimensional\ndirected animals problem to $(d-1)$-dimensional Yang-Lee edge-singularity\nproblem is established. Self-organized critical formulation of the percolation\nproblem, which does not involve any fine-tuning of coupling constants to get\ncritical behavior is briefly discussed.\n", "  Playing the game of heads or tails in zero gravity demonstrates that there\nexists a contextual \"measurement\" in classical mechanics. When the coin is\nflipped, its orientation is a continuous variable. However, the \"measurement\"\nthat occurs when the coin is caught by clapping two hands together gives a\ndiscrete value (heads or tails) that depends on the context (orientation of the\nhands). It is then shown that there is a strong analogy with the spin\nmeasurement of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and in particular with Stern and\nGerlach's sequential measurements. Finally, we clarify the analogy by recalling\nhow the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation simply explains the spin \"measurement\".\n", "  The causal set approach to the problem of quantum gravity is based on the\nhypothesis that spacetime is fundamentally discrete. Spacetime discreteness\nopens the door to novel types of dynamical law for cosmology and the Classical\nSequential Growth (CSG) models of Rideout and Sorkin form an interesting class\nof such laws. It has been shown that a renormalisation of the dynamical\nparameters of a CSG model occurs whenever the universe undergoes a Big\nCrunch-Big Bang bounce. In this paper we propose a way to model the creation of\na new universe after the singularity of a black hole. We show that\nrenormalisation of dynamical parameters occurs in a CSG model after such a\ncreation event. We speculate that this could realise aspects of Smolin's\nCosmological Natural Selection proposal.\n", "  We present MUSE observations of galaxy NGC 7469 from its Science Verification\nto show how powerful is the combination of high-resolution wide-field integral\nfield spectroscopy with both photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nsupernova (SN) explosions. Using STARLIGHT and HIIexplorer, we selected all Hii\nregions of the galaxy and produced 2- dimensional maps of the H{\\alpha}\nequivalent width, average luminosity-weighted stellar age, and oxygen\nabundance. We measured deprojected galactocentric distances for all Hii\nregions, and radial gradients for all above-mentioned parameters. We positioned\nthe type Ia SN 2008ec in the Branch et al. diagram, and finally discussed the\ncharacteristics of the SN parent Hii region compared to all other Hii regions\nin the galaxy. In a near future, the AMUSING survey will be able to reproduce\nthis analysis and construct statistical samples to enable the characterization\nof the progenitors of different supernova types.\n", "  We present an analysis of the $xF_3(x,Q^2)$ structure function and\nGross-Llewellyn Smith(GLS) sum rule taking into account the nuclear effects and\nhigher twist correction. This analysis is based on the results presented in \"N.\nM. Nath et al., Indian J Phys 90(1), 117 (2016)\". The corrections due to\nnuclear effects predicted in several earlier analysis are incorporated to our\nresults of $xF_3(x,Q^2)$ structure function and GLS sum rule for free nucleon,\ncorrected upto next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) perturbative order and\ncalculate the nuclear structure function as well as sum rule for nuclei. In\naddition, by means of a simple model we have extracted the higher twist\ncontributions to the non-singlet structure function $xF_3(x,Q^2)$ and GLS sum\nrule in NNLO perturbative orders and then incorporated them to our results. Our\nNNLO results along with nuclear effect and higher twist corrections are\nobserved to be compatible with corresponding experimental data and other\nphenomenological analysis.\n", "  Modulating heterogeneous microstructure in room temperature ionic liquids\n(RTILs) by external stimuli is an important approach for understanding and\ndesigning the external field induced chemical reactions in natural and\napplicable systems. Here, we report for the first time the redistribution of\noxygen molecules in RTILs due to laser-induced microstructure changes probed by\ntriplet excited state dynamics of porphyrin and rotational dynamics of coumarin\n153. A remarkably long-lived triplet excited state of porphyrin is observed in\nair-saturated ionic liquid with the changes of microstructure after\nirradiation, suggesting that more charge-shifted O2 induced by external laser\nfield move into the polar domains of ionic liquid [C8mim][PF6] from nonpolar\ndomains through electrostatic interactions. The results presented here suggest\nthat the heterogeneous systems of ionic liquids upon external stimuli can be\ndesigned for those oxygen-related chemical reactions with extensive\ninspirations for potential applications in lithium-air batteries, gaseous\nsensing, photoelectrical catalysis and so on.\n", "  Centrality is an important notion in complex networks; it could be used to\ncharacterize how influential a node or an edge is in the network. It plays an\nimportant role in several other network analysis tools including community\ndetection. Even though there are a small number of axiomatic frameworks\nassociated with this notion, the existing formalizations are not generic in\nnature. In this paper we propose a generic axiomatic framework to capture all\nthe intrinsic properties of a centrality measure (a.k.a. centrality index). We\nanalyze popular centrality measures along with other novel measures of\ncentrality using this framework. We observed that none of the centrality\nmeasures considered satisfies all the axioms.\n", "  We have found out that the band inversion in a silicene quantum dot (QD), in\nperpendicular magnetic $B$ and electric $\\Delta_z$ fields, drastically depends\non the strength of the magnetic field. We study the energy spectrum of the\nsilicene QD where the electric field provides a tunable band gap $\\Delta$.\nBoundary conditions introduce chirality, so that negative and positive angular\nmomentum $m$ zero Landau level (ZLL) edge states show a quite different\nbehavior regarding the band-inversion mechanism underlying the topological\ninsulator transition. We show that, whereas some ZLLs suffer band inversion at\n$\\Delta=0$ for any $B>0$, other ZLLs only suffer band inversion above critical\nvalues of the magnetic field at nonzero values of the gap.\n", "  Employing ab initio calculations, we discuss chemical, mechanical, and\ndynamical stability of MoN-TaN solid solutions together with cubic-like MoN/TaN\nsuperlattices, as another materials design concept. Hexagonal-type structures\nbased on low-energy modifications of MoN and TaN are the most stable ones over\nthe whole composition range. Despite being metastable, disordered cubic\npolymorphs are energetically significantly preferred over their ordered\ncounterparts. An in-depth analysis of atomic environments in terms of bond\nlengths and angles reveals that the chemical disorder results in (partially)\nbroken symmetry, i.e., the disordered cubic structure relaxes towards a\nhexagonal NiAs-type phase, the ground state of MoN. Surprisingly, also the\nsuperlattice architecture is clearly favored over the ordered cubic solid\nsolution. We show that the bi-axial coherency stresses in superlattices break\nthe cubic symmetry beyond simple tetragonal distortions and lead to a new\ntetragonal $\\zeta$-phase (space group P4/nmm), which exhibits a more negative\nformation energy than the symmetry-stabilized cubic structures of MoN and TaN.\nUnlike cubic TaN, the $\\zeta\\text{-TaN}$ is elastically and vibrationally\nstable, while $\\zeta$-MoN is stabilized only by the superlattice structure. To\nmap compositional trends in elasticity, we establish mechanical stability of\nvarious Mo$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$N systems and find the closest high-symmetry\napproximants of the corresponding elastic tensors. According to the estimated\npolycrystalline moduli, the hexagonal polymorphs are predicted to be extremely\nhard, however, less ductile than the cubic phases and superlattices. The trends\nin stability based on energetics and elasticity are corroborated by density of\nelectronic states.\n", "  We study mapping cones and their dual cones of positive maps of the n by n\nmatrices into itself. For a natural class of cones there is a close\nrelationship between maps in the cone, super-positive maps, and separable\nstates. In particular the composition of a map from the cone with a map in the\ndual cone is super-positive, and so the natural state it defines is separable.\n", "  The Rashba effect leads to a chiral precession of the spins of moving\nelectrons while the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) generates\npreference towards a chiral profile of local spins. We predict that the\nexchange interaction between these two spin systems results in a 'chiral'\nmagnetoresistance depending on the chirality of the local spin texture. We\nobserve this magnetoresistance by measuring the domain wall (DW) resistance in\na uniquely designed Pt/Co/Pt zigzag wire, and by changing the chirality of the\nDW with applying an in-plane magnetic field. A chirality-dependent DW\nresistance is found, and a quantitative analysis shows a good agreement with a\ntheory based on the Rashba model. Moreover, the DW resistance measurement\nallows us to independently determine the strength of the Rashba effect and the\nDMI simultaneously, and the result implies a possible correlation between the\nRashba effect, the DMI, and the symmetric Heisenberg exchange.\n", "  Within the problem of the finding of the mean potential energy of the charged\nparticle in the plasma in this work a classification of physical systems\n(electrolytes, dusty plasmas, plasmas) is made based on consideration, or lack\nthereof, of a few special additional conditions. The system considered here, as\nwell as other systems which are described with those additional conditions\nimposed are treated as the systems of the \"closed\" type, while the systems\nwhere those conditions are fully neglected - as being of the \"open\" type. In\nthe our previous investigation one- and two component systems were examined.\nHere, as the object of investigation fully ionized electron-ion plasma with\npositive charged ions of two different kinds, including the plasmas of higher\nnon-ideality, is chosen for the first time. For such plasma a new\nself-consistent model method of describing electrostatic screening is developed\nwhich includes all the necessary additional conditions. By this method such\nextremely significant phenomena as electron-ion and ion-ion correlations are\nincluded in the used model. The characteristics of the considered plasmas in a\nwide region of electron densities and temperatures are calculated. All the\nobtained results, including a comparison with systems of the \"open\" type are\nspecifically discussed.\n", "  Polarimetric observations of celestial sources in the hard X-ray band stand\nto provide new information on emission mechanisms and source geometries. PoGO+\nis a Compton scattering polarimeter (20-150 keV) optimised for the observation\nof the Crab (pulsar and wind nebula) and Cygnus X-1 (black hole binary), from a\nstratospheric balloon-borne platform launched from the Esrange Space Centre in\nsummer 2016. Prior to flight, the response of the polarimeter has been studied\nwith polarised and unpolarised X-rays allowing a Geant4-based simulation model\nto be validated. The expected modulation factor for Crab observations is found\nto be $M_{\\mathrm{Crab}}=(41.75\\pm0.85)\\%$, resulting in an expected Minimum\nDetectable Polarisation (MDP) of $7.3\\%$ for a 7 day flight. This will allow a\nmeasurement of the Crab polarisation parameters with at least $5\\sigma$\nstatistical significance assuming a polarisation fraction $\\sim20\\%$ $-$ a\nsignificant improvement over the PoGOLite Pathfinder mission which flew in 2013\nand from which the PoGO+ design is developed.\n", "  One of the most promising platforms for one-dimensional topological\nsuperconductivity is based on semiconducting nanowires with strong spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), where s-wave superconductivity is induced by proximity effect\nand an external Zeeman field drives the system into the topological\nsuperconducting phase with Majorana bound states (MBSs) at the end of the wire.\nDuring last years this idea has led to a great number of important experiments\nin hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems, where the main signature is an\nemergent zero-bias peak (ZBP) in the differential conductance as the Zeeman\nfield is increased.\n  This thesis focuses on the study of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor\njunctions made of semiconducting nanowires with Rashba SOC. We emphasise the\nimportance of employing hybrids superconductor-semiconductor nanowire junctions\ntowards the unambiguously detection of MBSs beyond zero-bias anomalies.\n", "  We show that it is possible to add or subtract many photons from a cavity\nfield by interacting it resonantly with a two-level atom. The atom, after\nentangling with the field inside the cavity and exiting it, may be measured in\none of the Schmidt states, producing a multiphoton process (in the sense that\ncan add or annihilate more photons than a single transition allows), i.e.,\nadding or subtracting several photons from the cavity field.\n", "  Specific features of the defect modes of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs)\nwith an isotropic defect, as well as their photonic density of states, Q\nfactor, and emission, have been investigated. The effect of the thicknesses of\nthe defect layer and the system as a whole, the position of the defect layer,\nand the dielectric boundaries on the features of the defect modes have been\nanalyzed.\n", "  In most of the under developed nations, access to basic health care is\nscarce. A heater is an indispensable device for many applications, especially\nfor medical purposes. As such a simple and easy to make heater from readily\navailable materials becomes a valuable equipment to help alleviate the human\nhealth problems. An ultra low cost heater from readily available materials like\npaper/cellulose acetate sheet and a pencil was designed and fabricated.\nManually, using high graphite contained pencil; paper/cellulose surface was\narbitrarily coated by applying numerous pencil strokes on the surface. Contacts\nwere connected using either a wire or Copper/Aluminum foils over the coated\nsurface. Maximum temperature attended by the heater was around 140 degree\ncelcius. The main application of this heater was explored in the laboratory and\ntherapeutic uses.\n", "  Device-based tunnel spectroscopy of superconductors was first performed by\nGiaever, whose seminal work provided clear evidence for the spectral gap in the\ndensity of states (DOS) predicted by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\ntheory. Since then, tunnel-barrier-based heterostructure devices have revealed\nmyriad physical phenomena and found a range of applications. Most of these\ndevices rely on a limited number of oxides, which form high-quality insulating,\nnon-magnetic barriers. These barriers, however, do not grow well on all\nsurfaces. Promising alternatives are van der Waals (vdW) materials, ultrathin\nlayers of which can be precisely positioned on many surfaces; they have been\nshown to form tunnel barriers when engaged with graphene. Here we demonstrate\nthat vdW semiconductors MoS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ deposited on the superconductor\nNbSe$_2$ form high quality tunnel barriers, with transparencies in the\n$10^{-8}$ range. Our measurements of the NbSe$_2$ DOS at 70mK show a hard\nsuperconducting gap, and a quasiparticle peak structure with clear evidence of\ncontributions from two bands, with intrinsic superconductivity in both bands.\nIn both perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields, we observe a sub-gap DOS\nassociated with vortex bound states. The linear dependence of the zero-bias\nsignal on perpendicular field allows us to confirm the s-wave nature of\nsuperconductivity in NbSe$_2$. As vdW tunnel barriers can be deployed on many\nsolid surfaces, they extend the range of superconducting and other materials\naddressable not only by high resolution tunneling spectroscopy but also\nnon-equilibrium and/or non-local transport.\n", "  Preparation of pure states on networks of quantum systems by controlled\ndissipative dynamics offers important advantages with respect to circuit-based\nschemes. Unlike in continuous-time scenarios, when discrete-time dynamics are\nconsidered, dead-beat stabilization becomes possible in principle. Here, we\nfocus on pure states that can be stabilized by distributed, unsupervised\ndynamics in finite time on a network of quantum systems subject to realistic\nquasi-locality constraints. In particular, we define a class of quasi-locality\nnotions, that we name \"tree-like hypergraphs,\" and show that the states that\nare robustly stabilizable in finite time are then unique ground states of a\nfrustration-free, commuting quasi-local Hamiltonian. A structural\ncharacterization of such states is also provided, building on a simple yet\nrelevant example.\n", "  Resonance energy transfer (RET) is an inherently anisotropic process. Even\nthe simplest, well-known F\\\"orster theory, based on the transition\ndipole-dipole coupling, implicitly incorporates the anisotropic character of\nRET. In this theoretical work, we study possible signatures of the fundamental\nanisotropic character of RET in hybrid nanomaterials composed of a\nsemiconductor nanoparticle (NP) decorated with molecular dyes. In particular,\nby means of a realistic kinetic model, we show that the analysis of the dye\nphotoluminescence difference for orthogonal input polarizations reveals the\nanisotropic character of the dye-NP RET which arises from the intrinsic\nanisotropy of the NP lattice. In a prototypical core/shell wurtzite CdSe/ZnS NP\nfunctionalized with cyanine dyes (Cy3B), this difference is predicted to be as\nlarge as 75\\% and it is strongly dependent in amplitude and sign on the dye-NP\ndistance. We account for all the possible RET processes within the system,\ntogether with competing decay pathways in the separate segments. In addition,\nwe show that the anisotropic signature of RET is persistent up to a large\nnumber of dyes per NP.\n", "  The document is prepared for the LCWS2016 conference proceedings. The\nexpected status of Higgs physics at the end of Run-3 is presented. The current\nRun-2 status is briefly reviewed, and the expected Higgs reach after the HL-LHC\nperiod is also summarized for some channels.\n", "  We analysed the flux-flow region of isofield magneto resistivity data\nobtained on three crystals of BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$ with $T_c$$\\sim$20 K for\nthree different geometries relative to the angle formed between the applied\nmagnetic field and the c-axis of the crystals. The field dependent activation\nenergy, $U_0$, was obtained from the TAFF and modified vortex-glass models,\nwhich were compared with the values of $U_0$ obtained from flux-creep available\nin the literature. We observed that the $U_0$ obtained from the TAFF model show\ndeviations among the different crystals, while the correspondent glass lines\nobtained from the vortex glass model are virtually coincident. It is shown that\nthe data is well explained by the modified vortex glass model, allowing to\nextract values of $T_g$, the glass transition temperature, and $T^*$, a\ntemperature which scales with the mean field critical temperature $T_c(H)$. The\nresulting glass lines obey the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory and are well\nfitted by a theory developed in the literature by considering the effect of\ndisorder.\n", "  Intersubband (ISB) polarons result from the interaction of an ISB transition\nand the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in a semiconductor quantum well (QW).\nTheir observation requires a very dense two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in\nthe QW and a polar or highly ionic semiconductor. Here we show that in\nZnO/MgZnO QWs the strength of such a coupling can be as high as 1.5 times the\nLO-phonon frequency due to the very dense 2DEG achieved and the large\ndifference between the static and high-frequency dielectric constants in ZnO.\nThe ISB polaron is observed optically in multiple QW structures with 2DEG\ndensities ranging from $5\\times 10^{12}$ to $5\\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, where\nan unprecedented regime is reached in which the frequency of the upper ISB\npolaron branch is three times larger than that of the bare ISB transition. This\nstudy opens new prospects to the exploitation of oxides in phenomena happening\nin the ultrastrong coupling regime.\n", "  Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus at least two, and let\n${\\mathcal Q}_X(r,d)$ be the quot scheme that parametrizes all the torsion\ncoherent quotients of ${\\mathcal O}^{\\oplus r}_X$ of degree $d$. This\n${\\mathcal Q}_X(r,d)$ is also a moduli space of vortices on $X$. Its geometric\nproperties have been extensively studied. Here we prove that the anticanonical\nline bundle of ${\\mathcal Q}_X(r,d)$ is not nef. Equivalently, ${\\mathcal\nQ}_X(r,d)$ does not admit any K\\\"ahler metric whose Ricci curvature is\nsemipositive.\n", "  We study the effect of proton irradiation on\nBa(Fe$_{0.96}$Co$_{0.04}$)$_2$As$_2$ superconducting single crystals from\ncombined magnetisation and magnetoresistivity measurements. The study allows\nthe extraction of the values of the apparent pinning energy $U_0$ of the\nsamples prior to and after irradiation, as well as comparison of the values of\n$U_0$ obtained from the flux-flow reversible region with those from the\nflux-creep irreversible region. Irradiation reduces $T_c$ modestly, but\nsignificantly reduces $U_0$ in both regimes: the critical current density $J_c$\nis modified, most strikingly by the disappearance of the second magnetisation\npeak after irradiation. Analysis of the functional form of the pinning force\nand of the temperature dependence of $J_c$ for zero field, indicates that\nproton irradiation in this case has not changed the pinning regime, but has\nintroduced a high density of shallow point-like defects. By consideration of a\nmodel that takes into account the effect of disorder on the irreversibility\nline, the data suggests that irradiation produced a considerable reduction in\nthe average effective disorder overall, consistent with the changes observed in\n$U_0$ and $J_c$.\n", "  Current-voltage ($I$-$V$) characteristics of Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ thin\nfilms in zero magnetic field are measured and analyzed with the conventional\nKosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB) approach, dynamic scaling approach and\nfinite-size scaling approach, respectively. It is found from these results that\nthe $I$-$V$ relation is determined by the vortex-unbinding mechanism with the\nKTB dynamic critical exponent $z=2$. On the other hand, the evidence of\nfinite-size effect is also found, which blurs the feature of a phase\ntransition.\n", "  Magnetic relaxation of high-pressure synthesized MgB$_2$ bulks with different\nthickness is investigated. It is found that the superconducting dia-magnetic\nmoment depends on time in a logarithmic way; the flux-creep activation energy\ndecreases linearly with the current density (as expected by Kim-Anderson\nmodel); and the activation energy increases linearly with the thickness of\nsample when it is thinner than about 1 mm. These features suggest that the\nvortices in the MgB$_2$ are rather rigid, and the pinning and creep can be well\ndescribed by Kim-Anderson model.\n"]}
