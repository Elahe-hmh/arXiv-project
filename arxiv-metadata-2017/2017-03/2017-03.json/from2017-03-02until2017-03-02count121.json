Then through the Casimir effect we offer a temperature correction to\nthe tachyon mass of the string. We see that for the fermionic part the\ntemperature correction is precisely the opposite of that of bosonic part, so\nthe quantum ground state of the superstring would remain massless, as expected.\n", "  We present a quantization of a Lie coideal structure for twisted half-loop\nalgebras of finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebras. We obtain algebra\nclosure relations of twisted Yangians in Drinfeld J presentation for all\nsymmetric pairs of simple Lie algebras and for simple twisted even half-loop\nLie algebras. We provide the explicit form of the closure relations for twisted\nYangians in Drinfeld J presentation for the ${\\mathfrak{sl}}_3$ Lie algebra.\n", "  A structural understanding of whole cells in three dimensions at high spatial\nresolution remains a significant challenge and, in the case of X-rays, has been\nlimited by radiation damage. By alleviating this limitation, cryogenic coherent\ndiffraction imaging (cryo-CDI) could bridge the important resolution gap\nbetween optical and electron microscopy in bio-imaging. Here, we report for the\nfirst time 3D cryo-CDI of a whole, frozen-hydrated cell - in this case a\nNeospora caninum tachyzoite - using 8 keV X-rays. Our 3D reconstruction reveals\nthe surface and internal morphology of the cell, including its complex,\npolarized sub-cellular architecture with a 3D resolution of ~75-100 nm, which\nis presently limited by the coherent X-ray flux and detector size. Given the\nimminent improvement in the coherent X-ray flux at the facilities worldwide,\nour work forecasts the possibility of routine 3D imaging of frozen-hydrated\ncells with spatial resolutions in the tens of nanometres.\n", "  In dense neutrino backgrounds present in supernovae and in the early\nUniverse, neutrino oscillations may exhibit complex collective phenomena, such\nas synchronized oscillations, bipolar oscillations and spectral splits and\nswaps. In this Letter we consider for the first time the effects of decoherence\nby wave packet separation on these phenomena. We derive the evolution equations\nthat govern neutrino oscillations in a dense medium in the presence of\ndecoherence and consider the evolution of several simple neutrino systems in\ndetail. We show that decoherence may modify the oscillation pattern\nsignificantly and lead to qualitatively new effects. In particular, contrary to\nthe no-decoherence case, strong flavor conversion becomes possible even in the\ncase of constant or nearly constant density of the neutrino background.\n", "  We investigate the flow of a strongly coupled anyonic superfluid based on the\nholographic D3-D7' probe brane model. By analyzing the spectrum of\nfluctuations, we find the critical superfluid velocity, as a function of the\ntemperature, at which the flow stops being dissipationless when flowing past a\nbarrier. We find that at a larger velocity the flow becomes unstable even in\nthe absence of a barrier.\n", "  At high enough charge density, the homogeneous state of the D3-D7' model is\nunstable to fluctuations at nonzero momentum. We investigate the end point of\nthis instability, finding a spatially modulated ground state, which is a charge\nand spin density wave. We analyze the phase structure of the model as a\nfunction of chemical potential and magnetic field and find the phase transition\nfrom the homogeneous state to be first order, with a second-order critical\npoint at zero magnetic field.\n", "  Experimental data for fractional quantum Hall systems can to a large extent\nbe explained by assuming the existence of a modular symmetry group commuting\nwith the renormalization group flow and hence mapping different phases of\ntwo-dimensional electron gases into each other. Based on this insight, we\nconstruct a phenomenological holographic model which captures many features of\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect. Using an SL(2,Z)-invariant\nEinstein-Maxwell-axio-dilaton theory capturing the important modular\ntransformation properties of quantum Hall physics, we find dyonic diatonic\nblack hole solutions which are gapped and have a Hall conductivity equal to the\nfilling fraction, as expected for quantum Hall states. We also provide several\ntechnical results on the general behavior of the gauge field fluctuations\naround these dyonic dilatonic black hole solutions: We specify a sufficient\ncriterion for IR normalizability of the fluctuations, demonstrate the\npreservation of the gap under the SL(2,Z) action, and prove that the\nsingularity of the fluctuation problem in the presence of a magnetic field is\nan accessory singularity. We finish with a preliminary investigation of the\npossible IR scaling solutions of our model and some speculations on how they\ncould be important for the observed universality of quantum Hall transitions.\n", "  We study the physics of probe D6-branes with quantized internal worldvolume\nflux in the ABJM background with unquenched massless flavors. This flux breaks\nparity in the (2+1)-dimensional gauge theory and allows quantum Hall states.\nParity breaking is also explicitly demonstrated via the helicity dependence of\nthe meson spectrum. We obtain general expressions for the conductivities, both\nin the gapped Minkowski embeddings and in the compressible black hole ones.\nThese conductivities depend on the flux and contain a contribution from the\ndynamical flavors which can be regarded as an effect of intrinsic disorder due\nto quantum fluctuations of the fundamentals. We present an explicit, analytic\nfamily of supersymmetric solutions with nonzero charge density, electric, and\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  The indistinguishability of non-identical photons is dependent on detection\nsystem in quantum physics. If two photons with different wavelengths are\nindistinguishable for a detection system, there can be two-photon interference\nwhen these two photons are incident to two input ports of a Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterferometer, respectively. The reason why two-photon interference phenomena\nare different for classical and nonclassical light is not due to interference,\nbut due to the properties of light and detection system. These conclusions are\nhelpful to understand the physics and applications of two-photon interference.\n", "  In-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nhave been used to investigate many physical science phenomena, ranging from\nphase transitions, chemical reaction and crystal growth to grain boundary\ndynamics. A major limitation of in-situ XRD and TEM is a compromise that has to\nbe made between spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we report the\ndevelopment of in-situ X-ray nanodiffraction to measure atomic-resolution\ndiffraction patterns from single grains with up to 5 millisecond temporal\nresolution, and make the first real-time observation of grain rotation and\nlattice deformation during photoinduced chemical reactions. The grain rotation\nand lattice deformation associated with the chemical reactions are quantified\nto be as fast as 3.25 rad./sec. and as large as 0.5 Angstroms, respectively.\nThe ability to measure atomic-resolution diffraction patterns from individual\ngrains with several millisecond temporal resolution is expected to find broad\napplications in materials science, physics, chemistry, and nanoscience.\n", "  We consider the hydrodynamics of the outer core of a neutron star under\nconditions when both neutrons and protons are superfluid. Starting from the\nequation of motion for the phases of the wave functions of the condensates of\nneutron pairs and proton pairs we derive the generalization of the Euler\nequation for a onecomponent fluid. These equations are supplemented by the\nconditions for conservation of neutron number and proton number. Of particular\ninterest is the effect of entrainment, the fact that the current of one nucleon\nspecies depends on the momenta per nucleon of both condensates. We find that\nthe nonlinear terms in the Euler-like equation contain contributions that have\nnot always been taken into account in previous applications of superfluid\nhydrodynamics. We apply the formalism to determine the frequency of\noscillations about a state with stationary condensates and states with a\nspatially uniform counterflow of neutrons and protons. The velocities of the\ncoupled sound-like modes of neutrons and protons are calculated from properties\nof uniform neutron star matter evaluated on the basis of chiral effective field\ntheory. We also derive the condition for the two-stream instability to occur.\n", "  In the last years it has been revealed that if measuring relative to higher\norder event planes $\\Psi_n$, higher order flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n>2$ can\nbe measured. It also turned out that Bose-Einstein (HBT) correlation radii also\nshow 3rd order oscillations if measured versus the third order event plane\n$\\Psi_3$. In this paper we investigate how these observables can be described\nvia analytic hydro solutions and hydro parameterizations. We also investigate\nthe time evolution of asymmetry coefficients and the mixing of velocity field\nasymmetries and density asymmetries.\n", "  We review a systematic practical implementation of the multiple scattering\nformalism due to Balian and Duplantier [R. Balian and B. Duplantier, Ann. Phys.\n(NY) \\textbf{104}, 300 (1977); \\textbf{112}, 165 (1978)] for the calculation of\nthe Casimir interaction between arbitrarily shaped smooth conductors. The\nleading two-point scattering term of the expansion has a simple compact form,\namenable to exact or accurate numerical evaluation. It is a general expression\nwhich improves upon the proximity force and pairwise summation approximations.\nWe show that for many geometries it captures the bulk of the interaction\neffect. The inclusion of terms beyond the two-point approximation provides an\naccuracy check and explains screening. As an illustration of the power and\nversatility of the method we re-evaluate sphere-sphere and sphere-plane\ninteractions and compared the results with previous findings that employed\ndifferent methods. We also compute for the first time interaction of a\nhyperboloid (mimicking an atomic force microscope tip) and a plane. We also\nanalyze the anomalous situations involving long cylindrical conductors where\nthe two-point scattering approximation fails qualitatively. In such cases\nanalytic summation of the entire scattering series is carried out and a\ntopological argument is put forward as an explanation of the result. We give\nthe extension of this theory to the case of finite temperatures where the\ntwo-point scattering approximation result has a simple compact form, also\namenable to exact or accurate numerical evaluation.\n", "  Crystallography, the primary method for determining the three-dimensional\n(3D) atomic positions in crystals, has been fundamental to the development of\nmany fields of science. However, the atomic positions obtained from\ncrystallography represent a global average of many unit cells in a crystal.\nHere, we report, for the first time, the determination of the 3D coordinates of\nthousands of individual atoms and a point defect in a material by electron\ntomography with a precision of ~19 picometers, where the crystallinity of the\nmaterial is not assumed. From the coordinates of these individual atoms, we\nmeasure the atomic displacement field and the full strain tensor with a 3D\nresolution of ~1nm^3 and a precision of ~10^-3, which are further verified by\ndensity functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The\nability to precisely localize the 3D coordinates of individual atoms in\nmaterials without assuming crystallinity is expected to find important\napplications in materials science, nanoscience, physics and chemistry.\n", "  We carry out a layer-by-layer investigation to understand electron transport\nacross metal-insulator-metal junctions. Interfacial structures of junctions\nwere studied and characterized using first-principles density functional theory\nwithin the generalized gradient approximation. We found that as a function of\nthe number of crystal layers the calculated transmission coefficients of\nmultilayer silicene junctions decay much slower than for BN-based junctions We\nrevisited the semiclassical Boltzmann theory of electronic transport and\napplied to multilayer silicene and BN-based junctions. The calculated\nresistance in the high-transmission regime is smaller than that provided by the\nLandauer formula. As the thickness of the barrier increases, results from the\nBoltzmann and the Landauer formulae converge. We provide a upper limit in the\ntransmission coefficient below which, the Landauer method becomes valid.\nQuantitatively, when the transmission coefficient is lower than $ \\sim 0.05 $\nper channel, the error introduced by the Landauer formula for calculating the\nresistance is negligible. In addition, we found that the resistance of a\njunction is not entirely determined by the averaged transmission, but also by\nthe distribution of the transmission over the first Brillouin zone.\n", "  The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for\nseveral decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and\nreoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the\ndynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.\n", "  The dynamics of entanglement has recently been realized as a useful probe in\nstudying ergodicity and its breakdown in quantum many-body systems. In this\npaper, we study theoretically the growth of entanglement in quantum many-body\nsystems and propose a method to measure it experimentally. We show that\nentanglement growth is related to the spreading of local operators in real\nspace. We present a simple toy model for ergodic systems in which linear\nspreading of operators results in a universal, linear in time growth of\nentanglement for initial product states, in contrast with the logarithmic\ngrowth of entanglement in many-body localized (MBL) systems. Furthermore, we\nshow that entanglement growth is directly related to the decay of the Loschmidt\necho in a composite system comprised of several copies of the original system,\nin which connections are controlled by a quantum switch (two-level system). By\nmeasuring only the switch's dynamics, the growth of the R\\'enyi entropies can\nbe extracted. Our work provides a way of understanding entanglement dynamics in\nmany-body systems, and to directly measure its growth in time via a single\nlocal measurement.\n", "  Understanding the rheological properties of soft biological tissue is a key\nissue for mechanical systems used in the healthcare field. We propose a simple\nempirical model using Fractional Dynamics and Exponential Nonlinearity (FDEN)\nto identify the rheological properties of soft biological tissue. The model is\nderived from detailed material measurements using samples isolated from porcine\nliver. We conducted dynamic viscoelastic and creep tests on liver samples using\na rheometer. The experimental results indicated that biological tissue has\nspecific properties: i) power law increases in storage elastic modulus and loss\nelastic modulus with the same slope; ii) power law gain decrease and constant\nphase delay in the frequency domain over two decades; iii) log-log scale\nlinearity between time and strain relationships under constant force; and iv)\nlinear and log scale linearity between strain and stress relationships. Our\nsimple FDEN model uses only three dependent parameters and represents the\nspecific properties of soft biological tissue.\n", "  We introduce quantum walks on Cayley graphs of non-Abelian groups. We focus\non the easiest case of virtually Abelian groups, and introduce a technique to\nreduce the quantum walk to an equivalent one on an Abelian group with coin\nsystem having larger dimension. We apply the technique in the case of two\nquantum walks on virtually Abelian groups with planar Cayley graphs, finding\nthe exact solution.\n", "  General properties of neutron stars are briefly reviewed with an emphasis on\nthe indispensability of general relativity in our understanding of these\nfascinating objects. In Newtonian gravity the pressure within a star merely\nplays the role of opposing self-gravity. In general relativity all sources of\nenergy and momentum contribute to the gravity. As a result the pressure not\nonly opposes gravity but also enhances it. The later role of pressure becomes\nmore pronounced with increasing compactness, $M/R$ where $M$ and $R$ are the\nmass and radius of the star, and sets a critical mass beyond which collapse is\ninevitable. This critical mass has no Newtonian analogue; it is conceptually\ndifferent than the Stoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit in Newtonian gravity which\nis attained asymptotically for ultra-relativistic fermions. For white dwarfs\nthe general relativistic critical mass is very close to the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. For neutron stars the maximum mass---so\ncalled Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit---is significantly smaller than the\nStoner-Landau-Chandrasekhar limit. This follows from the fact that the general\nrelativistic correction to hydrostatic equilibrium within a neutron star is\nsignificant throughout the star, including the central part where the mass\ncontained within radial coordinate, $m(r)$, and the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration, $Gm(r)/r^2$, are small.\n", "  We explore possibility to find out a new model of gravastars in the extended\n$D$-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell spacetime. The class of solutions as obtained\nby Mazur and Mottola of a neutral gravastar \\cite{Mazur2001,Mazur2004} have\nbeen observed as an alternative to $D$-dimensional versions of the\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. To tackle the spherical system in a\nconvenient way we have configured that the gravastar consists of three distinct\nregions with different equations of state as follows: [I] Interior region $0\n\\leq r < r_1$,$\\rho = -p$, [II] Thin shell region $r_1 \\leq r < r_2$,$\\rho =\np$, and [III] Exterior region $r_2 < r$,$\\rho = p =0$. The outer region of this\ngravastar model therefore corresponds to a higher dimensional\nReissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m black hole. In connection to this junction conditions\nare provided and therefore we have formulated mass and the related Equation of\nState of the gravastar. It has been shown that the model satisfies all the\nrequirements of the physical features. However, overall observational survey of\nthe results also provide probable indication of non-applicability of higher\ndimensional approach for construction of a gravastar with or without charge\nfrom an ordinary $4$-dimensional seed as far as physical ground is concerned.\n", "  Quantum tensor network states and more particularly projected entangled-pair\nstates provide a natural framework for representing ground states of gapped,\ntopologically ordered systems. The defining feature of these representations is\nthat topological order is a consequence of the symmetry of the underlying\ntensors in terms of matrix product operators. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic study of those matrix product operators, and show how this relates\nentanglement properties of projected entangled-pair states to the formalism of\nfusion tensor categories. From the matrix product operators we construct a\nC*-algebra and find that topological sectors can be identified with the central\nidempotents of this algebra. This allows us to construct projected\nentangled-pair states containing an arbitrary number of anyons. Properties such\nas topological spin, the S matrix, fusion and braiding relations can readily be\nextracted from the idempotents. As the matrix product operator symmetries are\nacting purely on the virtual level of the tensor network, the ensuing Wilson\nloops are not fattened when perturbing the system, and this opens up the\npossibility of simulating topological theories away from renormalization group\nfixed points. We illustrate the general formalism for the special cases of\ndiscrete gauge theories and string-net models.\n", "  We discuss spectral characteristics of a one-dimensional quantum walk whose\ncoins are distributed quasi-periodically. The unitary update rule of this\nquantum walk shares many spectral characteristics with the critical\nAlmost-Mathieu Operator; however, it possesses a feature not present in the\nAlmost-Mathieu Operator, namely singularity of the associated cocycles (this\nfeature is, however, present in the so-called Extended Harper's Model). We show\nthat this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the\nLyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor\nspectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary\nphase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will\nshow something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum\nare of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic\nquasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for\neach irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases\nhaving Lebesgue measure zero. The key ingredients in our proofs are an\nadaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via\nthe Fourier transform, and a Johnson-type theorem for singular dynamically\ndefined CMV matrices which characterizes their spectra as the set of spectral\nparameters at which the associated cocycles fail to admit a dominated\nsplitting.\n", "  The general view is that all fundamental physical laws should be formulated\nwithin the framework given by quantum mechanics (QM). In a sense, QM therefore\nhas the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to\nderive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,\nphilosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated\nepistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on\nentities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like\nknowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the\npotential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges\nfrom this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities\nare defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means\nthat the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of\ndescription, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These\nelements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.\nThe evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution\nof the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase\nspace. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in\n\\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\\rightarrow n+1$ each\ntime an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time\n$n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances\nbetween events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with\neach $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about\nthe temporal relations between present and past events.\n", "  Flagpole and flag-dipole spinors are particular classes of spinor fields that\nhas been recently used in different branches of theoretical physics. In this\npaper, we study the possibility and consequences of these spinor fields to\ninduce an underlying fluid flow structure in the background of Kerr spacetimes.\nWe show that flag-dipole spinor fields are solutions of the equations of motion\nin this context. To our knowledge, this is the second time that this class of\nspinor field appears as a physical solution, the first one occurring as a\nsolution of the Dirac equation in ESK gravities.\n", "  We study network centrality based on dynamic influence propagation models in\nsocial networks. To illustrate our integrated mathematical-algorithmic approach\nfor understanding the fundamental interplay between dynamic influence processes\nand static network structures, we focus on two basic centrality measures: (a)\nSingle Node Influence (SNI) centrality, which measures each node's significance\nby its influence spread; and (b) Shapley Centrality, which uses the Shapley\nvalue of the influence spread function --- formulated based on a fundamental\ncooperative-game-theoretical concept --- to measure the significance of nodes.\nWe present a comprehensive comparative study of these two centrality measures.\nMathematically, we present axiomatic characterizations, which precisely capture\nthe essence of these two centrality measures and their fundamental differences.\nAlgorithmically, we provide scalable algorithms for approximating them for a\nlarge family of social-influence instances. Empirically, we demonstrate their\nsimilarity and differences in a number of real-world social networks, as well\nas the efficiency of our scalable algorithms. Our results shed light on their\napplicability: SNI centrality is suitable for assessing individual influence in\nisolation while Shapley centrality assesses individuals' performance in group\ninfluence settings.\n", "  In this Letter, we explore the possibility of developing Bell inequalities\npredicated on models using a single Local Hidden Variable (s-LHV), a strict\nsubset of general LHV models. Because of the less strenuous constraints imposed\nby s-LHV models, we were able to derive a contingent Bell inequality in analogy\nto the CHSH inequality, but which does not require bounding of measurement\nstatistics. Following this, we show by explicit example that there are cases of\nstates that rule out s-LHV models by violating our inequality, but which\nnonetheless have a multivariate LHV model. Even so, we show how merely ruling\nout s-LHV models is still sufficient to allow for fully device independent\nquantum key distribution (QKD) and entanglement witnessing. This being the\ncase, our inequality illustrates two things. First, it makes fully\ndevice-independent QKD on continuous variables substantially more\nstraightforward. Second, it shows how the degree of correlation needed to\ndemonstrate device-independent QKD is distinct from both Bell-nonlocality and\nEPR-steering. Although nonlocality in general requires ruling out all LHV\nmodels, s-LHV models are sufficiently useful to warrant further exploration.\n", "  With the discovery of the black hole binary (BBH) coalescence GW150914 the\nera of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has started. It has recently been\nshown that BBH with masses comparable to or higher than GW150914 would be\nvisible in the eLISA band a few years before they finally merge in the band of\nground-based detectors. This would allow for pre-merger electromagnetic alerts,\ndramatically increasing the chances of a joint detection, if BBH are indeed\nluminous in the electromagnetic band. In this paper we explore a quite\ndifferent aspect of multi-band GW astronomy, and verify if, and to what extent,\nmeasurement of masses and sky position with eLISA could improve parameter\nestimation and tests of general relativity with ground-based detectors. We\ngenerate a catalog of 200 BBH and find that having prior information from eLISA\ncan reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of source distance and primary\nblack hole spin by up to factor of 2 in ground-based GW detectors. The\ncomponent masses estimate from eLISA will not be refined by the ground based\ndetectors, whereas joint analysis will yield precise characterization of the\nnewly formed black hole and improve consistency tests of general relativity.\n", "  We present new methods for mapping the curl-free (E-mode) and divergence-free\n(B-mode) components of spin 2 signals using spin directional wavelets. Our\nmethods are equally applicable to measurements of the polarisation of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) and the shear of galaxy shapes due to weak\ngravitational lensing. We derive pseudo and pure wavelet estimators, where E-B\nmixing arising due to incomplete sky coverage is suppressed in wavelet space\nusing scale- and orientation-dependent masking and weighting schemes. In the\ncase of the pure estimator, ambiguous modes (which have vanishing curl and\ndivergence simultaneously on the incomplete sky) are also cancelled. On\nsimulations, we demonstrate the improvement (i.e., reduction in leakage)\nprovided by our wavelet space estimators over standard harmonic space\napproaches. Our new methods can be directly interfaced in a coherent and\ncomputationally-efficient manner with component separation or feature\nextraction techniques that also exploit wavelets.\n", "  Assuming that one neutrino type with definite mass is described by a massive\nDirac field operator, it is shown that the physical one-particle states for\nparticles and antiparticles can be rotated to each other, irrespective of their\nhelicity. This result is used to prove that the neutrino must necessarily be a\nMajorana particle.\n", "  In this paper we construct a path integral formulation of quantum mechanics\non noncommutative phase-space. We first map the system to an equivalent system\non the noncommutative plane. Then by applying the formalism of representing a\nquantum system in the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators acting on\nnoncommutative configuration space, the path integral action of a particle is\nderived. It is observed that the action has a similar form to that of a\nparticle in a magnetic field in the noncommutative plane. From this action the\nenergy spectrum is obtained for the free particle and the harmonic oscillator\npotential. We also show that the nonlocal nature (in time) of the action yields\na second class constrained system from which the noncommutative Heisenberg\nalgebra can be recovered.\n", "  We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring with\nflat and step initial conditions. We assume that the size of the ring and the\nnumber of particles tend to infinity proportionally and evaluate the\nfluctuations of tagged particles and currents. The crossover from the KPZ\ndynamics to the equilibrium dynamics occurs when the time is proportional to\nthe 3/2 power of the ring size. We compute the limiting distributions in this\nrelaxation time scale. The analysis is based on an explicit formula of the\nfinite-time one-point distribution obtained from the coordinate Bethe ansatz\nmethod.\n", "  Why is the spine of a neuron so small that only small numbers of molecules\ncan exist and reactions inevitably become stochastic? Despite such noisy\nconditions, we previously showed that the spine exhibits robust, sensitive and\nefficient features of information transfer using probability of Ca$^{2+}$\nincrease; however, their mechanisms remains unknown. Here we show that the\nsmall-volume effect enables robust, sensitive and efficient information\ntransfer in the spine volume, but not in the cell volume. In the spine volume,\nintrinsic noise in reactions becomes larger than extrinsic noise of input,\nmaking robust information transfer against input fluctuation. Stochastic\nfacilitation of Ca$^{2+}$ increase occurs in the spine volume, making higher\nsensitivity to lower intensity of input. Volume-dependency of information\ntransfer enables efficient information transfer per input in the spine volume.\nThus, we propose that the small-volume effect is the functional reasons why the\nspine has to be so small.\n", "  Double Weyl nodes are topologically protected band crossing points which\ncarry chiral charge $\\pm2$. They are stabilized by $C_{4}$ point group symmetry\nand are predicted to occur in $\\mathrm{SrSi_{2}}$ or $\\mathrm{HgCr_{2}Se_{4}}$.\nWe study their stability and physical properties in the presence of a disorder\npotential. We investigate the density of states and the quantum transport\nproperties at the nodal point. We find that, in contrast to their counterparts\nwith unit chiral charge, double Weyl nodes are unstable to any finite amount of\ndisorder and give rise to a diffusive phase, in agreement with predictions of\nGoswami and Nevidomskyy [Phys. Rev. B 92, 214504 (2015)] and Bera, Sau, and Roy\n[Phys. Rev. B 93, 201302(R) (2016)]. However, for finite system sizes a\ncrossover between pseudodiffusive and diffusive quantum transport can be\nobserved.\n", "  Correlating 3D arrangements of atoms and defects with material properties and\nfunctionality forms the core of several scientific disciplines. Here, we\ndetermined the 3D coordinates of 6,569 iron and 16,627 platinum atoms in a\nmodel iron-platinum nanoparticle system to correlate 3D atomic arrangements and\nchemical order/disorder with material properties at the single-atom level. We\nidentified rich structural variety and chemical order/disorder including 3D\natomic composition, grain boundaries, anti-phase boundaries, anti-site point\ndefects and swap defects. We show for the first time that experimentally\nmeasured 3D atomic coordinates and chemical species with 22 pm precision can be\nused as direct input for first-principles calculations of material properties\nsuch as atomic magnetic moments and local magnetocrystalline anisotropy. This\nwork not only opens the door to determining 3D atomic arrangements and chemical\norder/disorder of a wide range of nanostructured materials with high precision,\nbut also will transform our understanding of structure-property relationships\nat the most fundamental level.\n", "  We study the transfer matrix spectral problem for the cyclic representations\nof the trigonometric 6-vertex reflection algebra associated to the\nBazhanov-Stroganov Lax operator. The results apply as well to the spectral\nanalysis of the lattice sine-Gordon model with integrable open boundary\nconditions. This spectral analysis is developed by implementing the method of\nseparation of variables (SoV). The transfer matrix spectrum (both eigenvalues\nand eigenstates) is completely characterized in terms of the set of solutions\nto a discrete system of polynomial equations in a given class of functions.\nMoreover, we prove an equivalent characterization as the set of solutions to a\nBaxter's like T-Q functional equation and rewrite the transfer matrix\neigenstates in an algebraic Bethe ansatz form. In order to explain our method\nin a simple case, the present paper is restricted to representations containing\none constraint on the boundary parameters and on the parameters of the\nBazhanov-Stroganov Lax operator. In a next article, some more technical tools\n(like Baxter's gauge transformations) will be introduced to extend our approach\nto general integrable boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper, the consequences of introducing a deformed Snyder-Kepler\npotential in the Schwarzchild metric are investigated. After this modification,\nit is obtained a dynamically depending horizon with different penetration\nradius for massive particles and light rays in radial orbits. In the case of\ncircular orbits, they all remain untouched.\n", "  Since the rediscovery of Horndeski gravity, a lot of work has been devoted to\nthe exploration of its properties, especially in the context of dark energy.\nHowever, one sector of this theory, namely the one containing the coupling of\nthe Einstein tensor to the kinetic term of the scalar field, shows some\nsurprising features in the construction of black holes and neutron stars.\nMotivated by these new results, I explore the possibility that this sector of\nHorndeski gravity can mimic cold dark matter at cosmological level and also\nexplain the flattening of galactic rotation curves. I will show that, in\nprinciple, it is possible to achieve both goals with at least two scalar fields\nand a minimal set of assumptions.\n", "  In this paper, we deal with the null geodesics extending from the\nnear-horizon region out to a distant observatory in an extremal Kerr-Newman\nblack hole background. In particular, using the matched asymptotic expansion\nmethod, we analytically solve the null geodesics near the superradiant bound in\nthe form of algebraic equations. For the case that the photon trajectories are\nlimited in the equatorial plane, the shifts in the azimuthal angle and time are\nobtained.\n", "  We present a numerical and analytical study of incompressible homogeneous\nconducting fluids using a helical Fourier representation. We analytically study\nboth small- and large-scale dynamo properties, as well as the inverse cascade\nof magnetic helicity, in the most general minimal subset of interacting\nvelocity and magnetic fields on a closed Fourier triad. We mainly focus on the\ndependency of magnetic field growth as a function of the distribution of\nkinetic and magnetic helicities among the three interacting wavenumbers. By\ncombining direct numerical simulations of the full magnetohydrodynamics\nequations with the helical Fourier decomposition we numerically confirm that in\nthe kinematic dynamo regime the system develops a large-scale magnetic helicity\nwith opposite sign compared to the small-scale kinetic helicity, a sort of\ntriad-by-triad $\\alpha$-effect in Fourier space. Concerning the small-scale\nperturbations, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically that the\nlargest instability is achieved for the magnetic component with the same\nhelicity of the flow, in agreement with the Stretch-Twist-Fold mechanism. Vice\nversa, in presence of a Lorentz feedback on the velocity, we find that the\ninverse cascade of magnetic helicity is mostly local if magnetic and kinetic\nhelicities have opposite sign, while it is more nonlocal and more intense if\nthey have the same sign, as predicted by the analytical approach. Our\nanalytical and numerical results further demonstrate the potential of the\nhelical Fourier decomposition to elucidate the entangled dynamics of magnetic\nand kinetic helicities both in fully developed turbulence and in laminar flows.\n", "  The interaction between nuclei in the inner crust of neutron stars consists\nof two contributions, the so-called \"direct\" interaction and an \"induced\" one\ndue to density changes in the neutron fluid. For large nuclear separations $r$\nthe contributions from nuclear forces to each of these terms are shown to be\nnonzero. In the static limit they are equal in magnitude but have opposite\nsigns and they cancel exactly. We analyze earlier results on effective\ninteractions in the light of this finding. We consider the properties of\nlong-wavelength collective modes and, in particular, calculate the degree of\nmixing between the lattice phonons and the phonons in the neutron superfluid.\nUsing microscopic theory, we calculate the net non-Coulombic contribution to\nthe nucleus--nucleus interaction and show that, for large $r$, the leading term\nis due to exchange of two phonons and varies as $1/r^7$: it is an analog of the\nCasimir--Polder interaction between neutral atoms.\n", "  In this paper we derive constraints on the emission of a massive\n(pseudo)scalar $S$ from annihilation of neutrinos in the core of supernovae\nthrough the dimension-4 coupling $\\nu\\nu S$, as well as the effective\ndimension-5 operator $\\frac{1}{\\Lambda}(\\nu\\nu)(SS)$. While most of earlier\nstudies have focused on massless or ultralight scalars, our analysis involves\nscalar with masses of order $\\mathrm{eV- GeV}$ which can be copiously produced\nduring the explosion of supernovae, whose core temperature is generally of\norder $T\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV. From the luminosity and deleptonization\narguments regarding the observation of SN1987A, we exclude a large range of\ncouplings $ 10^{-12} \\lesssim {|g_{\\alpha\\beta}|}\\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for the\ndimension-4 case, depending on the neutrino flavours involved and the scalar\nmass. In the case of dimension-5 operator, for a scalar mass from MeV to 100\nMeV the coupling $h_{\\alpha\\beta}$ get constrained from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}$,\nwith the cutoff scale explicitly set $\\Lambda = 1$ TeV. We finally show that if\nthe neutrino burst of a nearby supernova explosion is detected by\nSuper-Kamiokande and IceCube, the constraints will be largely reinforced.\n", "  We consider an inverse problem for Schr\\\"odinger operators on connected\nequilateral graphs with standard matching conditions. We calculate the spectral\ndeterminant and prove that the asymptotic distribution of a subset of its zeros\ncan be described by the roots of a polynomial. We verify that one of the roots\nis equal to the mean value of the potential and apply it to prove an\nAmbarzumian type result, i.e., if a specific part of the spectrum is the same\nas in the case of zero potential, then the potential has to be zero.\n", "  We construct hairy black hole solutions that merge with the anti-de Sitter\n(AdS$_4$) Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole at the onset of superradiance. These\nhairy black holes have, for a given mass and charge, higher entropy than the\ncorresponding AdS$_4$-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. Therefore, they are\nnatural candidates for the endpoint of the charged superradiant instability. On\nthe other hand, hairy black holes never dominate the canonical and\ngrand-canonical ensembles. The zero-horizon radius of the hairy black holes is\na soliton (i.e. a boson star under a gauge transformation). We construct our\nsolutions perturbatively, for small mass and charge, so that the properties of\nhairy black holes can be used to testify and compare with the endpoint of\ninitial value simulations. We further discuss the near-horizon scalar\ncondensation instability which is also present in global\nAdS$_4$-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes. We highlight the different nature of\nthe near-horizon and superradiant instabilities and that hairy black holes\nultimately exist because of the non-linear instability of AdS.\n", "  We consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring with\nstationary initial conditions. The crossover between KPZ dynamics and\nequilibrium dynamics occurs when time is proportional to the $3/2$ power of the\nring size. We obtain the limit of the height function along the direction of\nthe characteristic line in this time scale. The two-point covariance function\nin this scale is also discussed.\n", "  We propose theoretically a thermal switch operating by the magnetic-flux\ncontrolled diffraction of phase-coherent heat currents in a thermally biased\nJosephson junction based on a two-dimensional topological insulator. For short\njunctions, the system shows a sharp switching behavior while for long junctions\nthe switching is smooth. Physically, the switching arises from the Doppler\nshift of the superconducting condensate due to screening currents induced by a\nmagnetic flux. We suggest a possible experimental realization that exhibits a\nrelative temperature change of 40\\% between the on and off state for realistic\nparameters. This is a factor of two larger than in recently realized thermal\nmodulators based on conventional superconducting tunnel junctions.\n", "  Advanced gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO and Virgo, will\ndetect hundreds of gravitational waves emitted by binary black holes in the\nnext few years. The collection of detected sources is expected to have certain\nproperties. It is expected that a selection bias will exist toward higher mass\nsystems, that most events will be oriented with their angular momentum pointing\nto or away from Earth, and that quiet events will be much more numerous than\nloud events. In this paper we show how all these assumptions are only true for\nexisting detectors and do not have any universality. Using an network of\nproposed third-generation gravitational wave detectors, we show how each of\nthese assumptions must be revised and we discuss several consequences on the\ncharacterization of the sources.\n", "  We develop the formalism of fermionic matrix product states (fMPS) and show\nhow irreducible fMPS fall in two different classes, related to the different\ntypes of simple $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ graded algebras, which are physically\ndistinguished by the absence or presence of Majorana edge modes. The local\nstructure of fMPS with Majorana edge modes also implies that there is always a\ntwo-fold degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum. Using the fMPS formalism we\nmake explicit the correspondence between the $\\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of\ntime-reversal invariant spinless superconductors and the modulo 8 periodicity\nin the representation theory of real Clifford algebras. Studying fMPS with\ngeneral on-site unitary and anti-unitary symmetries allows us to define\ninvariants that label symmetry-protected phases of interacting fermions. The\nbehavior of these invariants under stacking of fMPS is derived, which reveals\nthe group structure of such interacting phases.We also consider spatial\nsymmetries and show how the invariant phase factor in the partition function of\nreflection symmetric phases on an unorientable manifold appears in the fMPS\nframework.\n", "  The magnetization process of a frustrated spin-1/2 spin-dimer model on a\nsquare lattice is investigated by means of a sign-problem-free quantum Monte\nCarlo algorithm developed recently. Rich field-induced quantum phases are\ndiscovered. We find two spin superfluids satisfying different symmetries upon\nlayer permutation. There exist as well two solid phases with distinct\ncheckerboard patterns. Besides, two kinds of spin supersolids are observed over\na finite regime of magnetic fields. The latter two phases can be stabilized\nwhen small but nonzero spin anisotropy is present. Various field-induced\ntransitions among these phases are explored. Our findings may provide guidance\nto the search of these interesting quantum phases in real frustrated spin-dimer\ncompounds.\n", "  The cost of the exact solution of the many-electron problem is believed to be\nexponential in the number of degrees of freedom, necessitating approximations\nthat are controlled and accurate but numerically tractable. In this paper, we\nshow that one of these approximations, the self-energy embedding theory (SEET),\nis derivable from a universal functional and therefore implicitly satisfies\nconservation laws and thermodynamic consistency. We also show how other\napproximations, such as the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and its\ncombinations with many-body perturbation theory, can be understood as a special\ncase of SEET and discuss how the additional freedom present in SEET can be used\nto obtain systematic convergence of results.\n", "  We consider a linear chain made of spins of one half in contact with a\ndissipative environment for which periodic delta-kicks are applied to the\nqubits of the linear chain in two different configurations: kicks applied to a\nsingle qubit and simultaneous kicks applied to two qubits of the linear chain.\nIn both cases the system reaches a non-equilibrium stationary condition in the\nlong time limit. We study the transient to the quasi stationary states and\ntheir properties as function of the kick parameters in the single kicked qubit\ncase and report the emergence of stationary entanglement between the kicked\nqubits when simultaneous kicks are applied. For doing our study we have derived\nan approximation to a master equation which serves us to analyze the effects of\na finite temperature and the zero temperature environment.\n", "  We show that a laser pulse can always be found that induces a desired optical\nresponse from an arbitrary dynamical system. As illustrations, driving fields\nare computed to induce the same optical response from a variety of distinct\nsystems (open and closed, quantum and classical). As a result, the observed\ninduced dipolar spectra without detailed information on the driving field is\nnot sufficient to characterize atomic and molecular systems. The formulation\nmay also be applied to design materials with specified optical characteristics.\nThese findings reveal unexplored flexibilities of nonlinear optics.\n", "  We report the synthesis of a novel isotope engineered $^{13}{\\rm\nC}$--$^{12}{\\rm C}$ heteronuclear nanostructure: single-wall carbon nanotubes\nmade of $^{13}{\\rm C}$ enriched clusters which are embedded in natural carbon\nregions. The material is synthesized with a high temperature annealing from\n$^{13}{\\rm C}$ enriched benzene and natural ${\\rm C}_{60}$, which are\nco-encapsulated inside host SWCNTs in an alternating fashion. The Raman 2D line\nindicates that the $^{13}{\\rm C}$ isotopes are not distributed uniformly in the\ninner tubes. A semi-empirical method based modeling of the Raman modes under\n$^{13}{\\rm C}$ isotope enrichment shows that experimental data is compatible\nwith the presence of $^{13}{\\rm C}$ rich clusters which are embedded in a\nnatural carbon containing matrix. This material may find applications in\nquantum information processing and storage using nuclear spins as qubits.\n", "  Cosmic far-infrared background (CFIRB) probes unresolved dusty star-forming\ngalaxies across cosmic time and is complementary to ultraviolet and optical\nobservations of galaxy evolution. In this work, we interpret the observed CFIRB\nanisotropies using an empirical model based on resolved galaxies in ultraviolet\nand optical surveys. Our model includes stellar mass functions, star-forming\nmain sequence, and dust attenuation. We find that the commonly used linear\nKennicutt relation between infrared luminosity and star formation rate\noverproduces the observed CFIRB amplitudes. The observed CFIRB requires that\nlow-mass galaxies have lower infrared luminosities than expected from the\nKennicutt relation, implying that low-mass galaxies have lower dust content and\nweaker dust attenuation. Our results demonstrate that CFIRB not only provides a\nstringent consistency check for galaxy evolution models but also constrains the\ndust content of low-mass galaxies.\n", "  (abridged for arXiv) With the first direct detection of gravitational waves,\nthe Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has\ninitiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternate means of sensing\nthe universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run.\n", "  If dark matter particles have an electric charge, as in models of\nmillicharged dark matter, such particles should be accelerated in the same\nastrophysical accelerators that produce ordinary cosmic rays, and their spectra\nshould have a predictable rigidity dependence. Depending on the charge, the\nresulting \"dark cosmic rays\" can be detected as muon-like or neutrino-like\nevents in Super-Kamiokande, IceCube, and other detectors. We present new limits\nand propose several new analyses, in particular, for the Super-Kamiokande\nexperiment, which can probe a previously unexplored portion of the millicharged\ndark matter parameter space. Most of our results are fairly general and apply\nto a broad class of dark matter models.\n", "  Strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy is a well-known property of uranium\ncompounds. The almost isotropic ferromagnetism in $\\mathrm{U_{4}Ru_{7}Ge_{6}}$\nreported in this paper represents a striking exception. We present results of\nmagnetization, AC susceptibility, thermal expansion, specific heat and\nelectrical resistivity measurements performed on a $\\mathrm{U_{4}Ru_{7}Ge_{6}}$\nsingle crystal at various temperatures and magnetic fields and discuss them in\nconjunction with results of first-principles electronic-structure calculations.\n$\\mathrm{U_{4}Ru_{7}Ge_{6}}$ behaves as an itinerant 5$f$-electron ferromagnet\n($T_{\\mathrm{C}}= 10.7 K$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{S}}= 0.85 \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}/f.u.$ at\n1.9 K. The ground-state easy-magnetization direction is along the [111] axis of\nthe cubic lattice. The anisotropy field $\\mu_{0}H_{\\mathrm{a}}$ along the [001]\ndirection is only of $\\sim0.3 T$, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude\nsmaller value than in other U ferromagnets. At $T_{r}=5.9 K$ the easy\nmagnetization direction changes for [001] which holds at temperatures up to\n$T_{\\mathrm{C}}$. The magnetoelastic interaction induces a rhombohedral\n(tetragonal) distortion of the paramagnetic cubic crystal lattice in case of\nthe [111]([001]) easy-magnetization direction. The rhombohedral distortion is\nconnected with two crystallographically inequivalent U sites. The ab initio\ncalculated ground-state magnetic moment of $1.01 \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}/f.u.$ is\noriented along [111]. The two crystallographically inequivalent U sites are a\nconsequence of spin-orbit coupling of the U 5$f$-electrons. In the excited\nstate which is only 0.9 meV above the ground state the moment points to the\n[001] direction in agreement with experiment.\n", "  We consider the quantum vacuum effects of the massless scalar fields that are\nnon-minimally coupled to the background geometry of a collapsing homogeneous\nball of dust. It is shown that for a definite range of coupling constants,\nthere are repulsive quantum vacuum effects, capable of stopping the collapse\nprocess inside the black hole and precluding the formation of singularity. The\nfinal fate of the collapse will be a black hole with no singularity, inside\nwhich the matter stays balanced. The density of the final static matter will be\nclose to the Planck density. We show that the largest possible radius of the\nstable static ball inside a black hole with Schwarzschild mass $M$ is given by\n${{\\left( \\frac{1}{90\\pi }\\frac{M}{{{m}_{p}}} \\right)}^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{{\\ell\n}_{p}}$. If the black hole undergoes Hawking radiation, the final state will be\nan extremal quantum-corrected black hole, with zero temperature, with a remnant\nof matter inside. We show that the resolution of singularity is not disrupted\nunder Hawking radiation.\n", "  This work reports on models described by two real scalar fields coupled with\ngravity in the five-dimensional spacetime, with a warped geometry involving one\ninfinite extra dimension. Through a mechanism that smoothly changes a thick\nbrane into a hybrid brane, one investigates the appearance of hybrid branes\nhosting internal structure, characterized by the splitting on the energy\ndensity and the volcano potential, induced by the parameter which controls\ninteractions between the two scalar fields. In particular, we investigate\ndistinct symmetric and asymmetric hybrid brane scenarios.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a spin-1 diamond chain.\nOwing to a series of conservation laws, any eigenstate of this system can be\nexpressed using the eigenstates of finite odd-length chains or infinite chains\nwith spins 1 and 2. The ground state undergoes quantum phase transitions with\nvarying $\\lambda$, a parameter that controls frustration. Exact upper and lower\nbounds for the phase boundaries between these phases are obtained. The phase\nboundaries are determined numerically in the region not explored in the\nprevious work [Takano et al. J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 8 (1996) 6405].\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that the interaction of electrons in gapped\nDirac materials (gapped graphene and transition-metal dichalchogenide\nmonolayers) with a strong off-resonant electromagnetic field (dressing field)\nsubstantially renormalizes the band gaps and the spin-orbit splitting.\nMoreover, the renormalized electronic parameters drastically depend on the\nfield polarization. Namely, a linearly polarized dressing field always\ndecreases the band gap (and, particularly, can turn the gap into zero), whereas\na circularly polarized field breaks the equivalence of valleys in different\npoints of the Brillouin zone and can both increase and decrease corresponding\nband gaps. As a consequence, the dressing field can serve as an effective tool\nto control spin and valley properties of the materials and be potentially\nexploited in optoelectronic applications.\n", "  The ARIANNA hexagonal radio array (HRA) is an experiment in its pilot phase\ndesigned to detect cosmogenic neutrinos of energies above 10^16 eV. The most\nneutrino-like background stems from the radio emission of air showers. This\narticle reports on dedicated efforts of simulating and detecting the signals of\ncosmic rays. A description of the fully radio self-triggered data-set, the\nproperties of the detected air shower signals in the frequency range of\n\\unit[100-500]{MHz} and the consequences for neutrino detection are given. 38\nair shower signals are identified by their distinct waveform characteristics,\nare in good agreement with simulations and their signals provide evidence that\nneutrino-induced radio signals will be distinguishable with high efficiency in\nARIANNA. The cosmic ray flux at a mean energy of\n$6.5^{+1.2}_{-1.0}\\times10^{17}$ eV is measured to be\n$1.1^{+1.0}_{-0.7}\\times10^{-16}$ eV$^{-1}$km$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$yr$^{-1}$ and one\nfive-fold coincident event is used to illustrate the capabilities of the\nARIANNA detector to reconstruct arrival direction and energy of air showers.\n", "  We numerically investigate the interior of a four-dimensional, spherically\nsymmetric charged black hole accreting neutral null fluid. Previous study by\nMarolf and Ori suggested that late infalling observers encounter an effective\nshock wave as they approach the outgoing portion of the inner horizon.\nNon-linear perturbations could generate an effective gravitational shock wave,\nwhich manifests as a drop of the area coordinate $r$ from inner horizon value\n$r_{-}$ towards zero in an extremely short proper time duration of the\ninfalling observer. We consider three different scenarios: a) A charged black\nhole accreting a single (ingoing) null fluid; b) a charged black hole perturbed\nby two null fluids, ingoing and outgoing; c) a charged black hole perturbed by\nan ingoing null fluid and a self-gravitating scalar field. While we do not\nobserve any evidence for a gravitational shock in the first case, we detect the\nshock in the other two, using ingoing timelike and null geodesics. The shock\nwidth $\\Delta\\tau$ decreases rapidly with a fairly good match to a new,\ngeneralized exponential law, $\\Delta\\tau\\sim e^{-\\intop\\kappa_{-}\n(\\widetilde{V}_{f})d\\widetilde{V}_{f}}$, where $\\widetilde{V}_{f}$ is a\nspecific timing parameter for the ingoing timelike geodesics and\n$\\kappa_{-}(\\widetilde{V}_{f})$ is a generalized (Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om like)\nsurface gravity of the charged black hole at the inner horizon. We also gain\nnew insight into the inner (classical) structure of a charged black hole\nperturbed by two null fluids, including strong evidence for the existence of a\nspacelike $r=0$ singularity. We use a finite-difference numerical code with\ndouble-null coordinates combined with an adaptive gauge method in order to\nsolve the field equations from the region outside the black hole down to the\nvicinity of the $r=0$ singularity.\n", "  A $\\mathcal{CP}$ conserving $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory is spontaneously\nbroken to $\\mathrm{T}_7$ by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a\n$\\boldsymbol{15}$-plet. Even though the $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$-$\\,\\mathcal{CP}$\ntransformation is not broken by the VEV, the theory exhibits physical\n$\\mathcal{CP}$ violation in the broken phase. This is because the\n$\\mathrm{SU}(3)$-$\\,\\mathcal{CP}$ transformation corresponds to the unique\norder-two outer automorphism of $\\mathrm{T}_7$, which is not a physical\n$\\mathcal{CP}$ transformation for the $\\mathrm{T}_7$ states, and there is no\nother possible $\\mathcal{CP}$ transformation. We explicitly demonstrate that\n$\\mathcal{CP}$ is violated by calculating a $\\mathcal{CP}$ odd decay asymmetry\nin the broken phase. This scenario provides us with a natural protection for\ntopological vacuum terms, ensuring that\n$\\theta\\,G_{\\mu\\nu}\\widetilde{G}^{\\mu\\nu}$ is absent even though $\\mathcal{CP}$\nis violated for the physical states of the model.\n", "  We investigate the Goos-Hanchen (G-H) shifts reflected and transmitted by a\nyttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) film for both normal and oblique incidence. It is\nfound that the nonreciprocity effect of the MO material does not only result in\na nonvanishing reflected shift at normal incidence, but also leads to a\nslab-thickness-independent term which breaks the symmetry between the reflected\nand transmitted shifts at oblique incidence. The asymptotic behaviors of the\nnormal-incidence reflected shift are obtained in the vicinity of two\ncharacteristic frequencies corresponding to a minimum reflectivity and a total\nreflection, respectively. Moreover, the coexistence of two types of\nnegative-reflected-shift (NRS) at oblique incidence is discussed. We show that\nthe reversal of the shifts from positive to negative values can be realized by\ntuning the magnitude of applied magnetic field, the frequency of incident wave\nand the slab thickness as well as the incident angle. In addition, we further\ninvestigate two special cases for practical purposes: the reflected shift with\na total reflection and the transmitted shift with a total transmission.\nNumerical simulations are also performed to verify our analytical results.\n", "  A recent Google study [Phys. Rev. X, 6:031015 (2016)] compared a D-Wave 2X\nquantum processing unit (QPU) to two classical Monte Carlo algorithms:\nsimulated annealing (SA) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The study showed the\nD-Wave 2X to be up to 100 million times faster than the classical algorithms.\nThe Google inputs are designed to demonstrate the value of collective\nmultiqubit tunneling, a resource available to D-Wave QPUs but not to simulated\nannealing. But the computational hardness in these inputs is highly localized\nin gadgets, with only a small amount of complexity coming from global\ninteractions, meaning that the relevance to real-world problems is limited.\n  In this study we provide a new synthetic problem class that addresses the\nlimitations of the Google inputs while retaining their strengths. We use simple\nclusters instead of more complex gadgets and more emphasis is placed on\ncreating computational hardness through frustrated global interactions like\nthose seen in interesting real-world inputs. The logical problems used to\ngenerate these inputs can be solved in polynomial time [J. Phys. A, 15:10\n(1982)]. However, for general heuristic algorithms that are unaware of the\nplanted problem class, the frustration creates meaningful difficulty in a\ncontrolled environment ideal for study.\n  We use these inputs to evaluate the new 2000-qubit D-Wave QPU. We include the\nHFS algorithm---the best performer in a broader analysis of Google inputs---and\nwe include state-of-the-art GPU implementations of SA and QMC. The D-Wave QPU\nsolidly outperforms the software solvers: when we consider pure annealing time\n(computation time), the D-Wave QPU reaches ground states up to 2600 times\nfaster than the competition. In the task of zero-temperature Boltzmann sampling\nfrom challenging multimodal inputs, the D-Wave QPU holds a similar advantage as\nquantum sampling bias does not seem significant.\n", "  Phase reduction framework for limit-cycling systems based on isochrons has\nbeen used as a powerful tool for analyzing rhythmic phenomena. Recently, the\nnotion of isostables, which complements the isochrons by characterizing\namplitudes of the system state, i.e., deviations from the limit-cycle\nattractor, has been introduced to describe transient dynamics around the limit\ncycle [Wilson and Moehlis, Phys. Rev. E 94, 052213 (2016)]. In this study, we\nintroduce a framework for a reduced phase-amplitude description of transient\ndynamics of stable limit-cycling systems. In contrast to the preceding study,\nthe isostables are treated in a fully consistent way with the Koopman operator\nanalysis, which enables us to avoid discontinuities of the isostables and to\napply the framework to system states far from the limit cycle. We also propose\na new, convenient bi-orthogonalization method to obtain the response functions\nof the amplitudes, which can be interpreted as an extension of the adjoint\ncovariant Lyapunov vector to transient dynamics in limit-cycling systems. We\nillustrate the utility of the proposed reduction framework by estimating\noptimal injection timing of external input that efficiently suppresses\ndeviations of the system state from the limit cycle in a model of a biochemical\noscillator.\n", "  A one-dimensional quantum simulator can simulate two-dimensional quantum\nmany-body systems. A representation of a low-energy state is obtained by\napplying a feedback loop.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a massive charged scalar wave which except its\ncanonical coupling to gravity it is also coupled kinematically to Einstein\ntensor. We find that as the strength of the new coupling is increased the\nscattered wave off the horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole is\nsuperradiantly amplified resulting to the instability of the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime.\n", "  We have used a realistic nuclear potential, AV18, and a many body technique,\nthe lowest order constraint variational (LOCV) approach, to calculate the\nproperties of hot magnetized nuclear matter. By investigating the free energy,\nspin polarization parameter, and symmetry energy, we have studied the\ntemperature and magnetic field dependence of the saturation properties of\nmagnetized nuclear matter. In addition, we have calculated the equation of\nstate of magnetized nuclear matter at different temperatures and magnetic\nfields. It was found that the flashing temperature of nuclear matter decreases\nby increasing the magnetic field. In addition, we have studied the effect of\nthe magnetic field on liquid gas phase transition of nuclear matter. The liquid\ngas coexistence curves, the order parameter of the liquid gas phase transition,\nand the properties of critical point at different magnetic fields have been\ncalculated.\n", "  As an unusual type of anomalous diffusion behavior, the (transient)\nsuperballistic transport has been experimentally observed recently but it is\nnot well understood yet. In this paper, we investigate the white noise effect\n(in Markov approximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model\nwith periodic, disordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to two\nperfect lattices at both ends in which the wave packet is initially located at\nthe center of the sublattice. We find that in some completely localized system\ninducing noise could delocalize the system to desirable diffusion phase. This\ncontrollable system may be used to investigate the interplay of disorder and\nwhite noise, as well as exploring exotic quantum phase.\n", "  Our visual perception of our surroundings is ultimately limited by the\ndiffraction limit, which stipulates that optical information smaller than\nroughly half the illumination wavelength is not retrievable. Over the past\ndecades, many breakthroughs have led to unprecedented imaging capabilities\nbeyond the diffraction-limit, with applications in biology and nanotechnology.\nIn this context, nano-photonics has revolutionized the field of optics in\nrecent years by enabling the manipulation of light-matter interaction with\nsubwavelength structures. However, despite the many advances in this field, its\nimpact and penetration in our daily life has been hindered by a convoluted and\niterative process, cycling through modeling, nanofabrication and\nnano-characterization. The fundamental reason is the fact that not only the\nprediction of the optical response is very time consuming and requires solving\nMaxwell's equations with dedicated numerical packages. But, more significantly,\nthe inverse problem, i.e. designing a nanostructure with an on-demand optical\nresponse, is currently a prohibitive task even with the most advanced numerical\ntools due to the high non-linearity of the problem. Here, we harness the power\nof Deep Learning, a new path in modern machine learning, and show its ability\nto predict the geometry of nanostructures based solely on their far-field\nresponse. This approach also addresses in a direct way the currently\ninaccessible inverse problem breaking the ground for on-demand design of\noptical response with applications such as sensing, imaging and also for\nplasmon's mediated cancer thermotherapy.\n", "  1D lattice summations of the 3D Green's function are needed in many\napplications such as photonic crystals, antenna arrays, and so on. Such\nsummations are usually divided into two cases, depending on the location of the\nobserver: Out of the summation axis, or on the summation axis. Here, as a\nservice for the community, we present and summarize the summation formulas for\nboth cases. On the summation axis, we use polylogarithmic functions to express\nthe summation, and Away from the summation axis we use Poisson summation\n(equivalent to the expansion of the field to cylindrical harmonics)\n", "  The sub-barrier pairs of energy levels of a Hermitian one-dimensional\nsymmetric double well potential are known to merge into one, if the inter-well\ndistance ($a$) is increased slowly. The energy at which the doublets merge are\nthe ground state eigenvalues of independent wells ($\\epsilon_0$). We show that\nif the double well is perturbed mildly by a complex PT-symmetric potential the\nmerging of levels turns into the coalescing of two levels at an exceptional\npoint $a=a_*$. For $a>a_*$, the real part of complex-conjugate eigenvalues\ncoincides with $\\epsilon_0$ again. This is an interesting and rare connection\nbetween the two phenomena in two domains: Hermiticity and complex PT-symmetry.\n", "  Following arXiv:1506.00612, an effective field theory approach has been\nintroduced for two additional real scalars, $H$ and $\\chi$, to study the\nassociated Higgs boson ($h$) production with top quarks at the Large Hadron\nCollider with centre of mass energy $\\sqrt s = 8$ TeV. In all studies, one\nbenchmark scenario is considered where the parameters of the model are\nconstrained for $m_H = 275$ GeV and $m_\\chi = 60$ GeV. A comparative study has\nbeen performed for the production of the Higgs boson in association with a\nsingle top and top-pairs in the Standard Model with respect to the processes\nwhere $h$ is replaced with the heavy scalar $H$, which further decays via $H\n\\to h \\chi\\chi$. The analysis has been performed at two stages where the top\nquarks are studied through a single-lepton channel firstly, and then in the\nsecond case with same-sign leptons, electrons or muons in di-lepton events.\nDifferent observables, like $b$ and $c$-tagged jet multiplicities, total\nmissing energy, and total scalar sum of transverse momenta of all jets and\nleptons, has been studied.\n", "  The deformation theory of a Dirac structure is controlled by a differential\ngraded Lie algebra which depends on the choice of an auxiliary transversal\nDirac structure; if the transversal is not involutive, one obtains an\n$L_\\infty$ algebra instead. We develop a simplified method for describing this\n$L_\\infty$ algebra and use it to prove that the $L_\\infty$ algebras\ncorresponding to different transversals are canonically $L_\\infty$-isomorphic.\nIn some cases, this isomorphism provides a formality map, as we show in several\nexamples including (quasi)-Poisson geometry, Dirac structures on Lie groups,\nand Lie bialgebras. Finally, we apply our result to a classical problem in the\ndeformation theory of complex manifolds: we provide explicit formulas for the\nKodaira-Spencer deformation complex of a fixed small deformation of a complex\nmanifold, in terms of the deformation complex of the original manifold.\n", "  Dark matter with a non-zero self-interacting cross section ($\\sigma_{\\rm\nSIDM}$) has been posited as a solution to a number of outstanding astrophysical\nmysteries. Many studies of merging galaxy clusters have given constraints on\n$\\sigma_{\\rm SIDM}$ based on the spatial offset between the member galaxy\npopulation and the dark matter distribution. Assuming $\\sigma_{\\rm SIDM} = 0$,\nhow likely is it for us to see the galaxy-DM offset values observed in merging\nclusters of galaxies? To answer this question, we formulate a hypothesis test\nusing data from Illustris, a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation. We select 43\nIllustris clusters and their galaxy members at z~0 and examine the accuracy of\ncommonly used galaxy summary statistics, including kernel-density-estimation\n(KDE) luminosity peak, KDE number density peak, shrinking aperture, centroid\nand the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We use the dark-matter\nparticles to reproduce commonly adopted methods to identify dark-matter peaks\nbased on gravitational lensing cluster maps. By analysing each cluster in 768\nprojections, we determine the optimistic noise floor in the measurements of the\ngalaxy-DM offsets. We find that the choice of the galaxy summary statistics\naffects the inferred offset values substantially, with the BCG and the\nluminosity peak giving the tightest 68-th percentile offset levels, $\\lesssim$\n4 kpc and $\\lesssim$ 32 kpc, respectively. Shrinking aperture, number density\nand centroid give a large offset scatter of about 50-100 kpc at the 68-th\npercentile level, even for clusters with only one dominant mass component. Out\nof the 15 reported offsets from observed merging clusters that we examined, 13\nof them are consistent with Illustris unrelaxed cluster offsets at the 2-sigma\n(95-th percentile) level, i.e. consistent with the hypothesis that $\\Lambda$CDM\nis the true underlying physical model.\n", "  We present $\\texttt{galkin}$, a novel compilation of kinematic measurements\ntracing the rotation curve of our Galaxy, together with a tool to treat the\ndata. The compilation is optimised to Galactocentric radii between 3 and 20 kpc\nand includes the kinematics of gas, stars and masers in a total of 2780\nmeasurements carefully collected from almost four decades of literature. A\nsimple, user-friendly tool is provided to select, treat and retrieve the data\nof all source references considered. This tool is especially designed to\nfacilitate the use of kinematic data in dynamical studies of the Milky Way with\nvarious applications ranging from dark matter constraints to tests of modified\ngravity.\n", "  Certain quantum many-body ground states can be prepared by a large-depth\nquantum circuit consisting of geometrically local gates. In the presence of\nnoise, local expectation values deviate from the correct value at most by an\namount comparable to the noise rate. This happens if the action of the\nnoiseless circuit, restricted to certain subsystems, rapidly mixes local\nobservables up to a small correction. The encoding circuit for the surface code\nis given as an example.\n", "  Citizen science projects recruit members of the public as volunteers to\nprocess and produce datasets. These datasets must win the trust of the\nscientific community. The task of securing credibility involves, in part,\napplying standard scientific procedures to clean these datasets. However,\neffective management of volunteer behavior also makes a significant\ncontribution to enhancing data quality. Through a case study of Galaxy Zoo, a\ncitizen science project set up to generate datasets based on volunteer\nclassifications of galaxy morphologies, this paper explores how those involved\nin running the project manage volunteers. The paper focuses on how methods for\ncrediting volunteer contributions motivate volunteers to provide higher quality\ncontributions and to behave in a way that better corresponds to statistical\nassumptions made when combining volunteer contributions into datasets. These\nmethods have made a significant contribution to the success of the project in\nsecuring trust in these datasets, which have been well used by other\nscientists. Implications for practice are then presented for citizen science\nprojects, providing a list of considerations to guide choices regarding how to\ncredit volunteer contributions to improve the quality and trustworthiness of\ncitizen science-produced datasets.\n", "  It is widely assumed that human exploration beyond Earth's orbit will require\nvehicles capable of providing long-duration habitats that simulate an Earthlike\nenvironment: consistent artificial gravity, breathable atmosphere, and\nsufficient living space- while requiring the minimum possible launch mass. This\npaper examines how the qualities of digital cellular solids - high-performance,\nrepairability, reconfigurability, tunable mechanical response - allow the\naccomplishment of long-duration habitat objectives at a fraction of the mass\nrequired for traditional structural technologies. To illustrate the impact\ndigital cellular solids could make as a replacement to conventional habitat\nsubsystems, we compare recent proposed deep space habitat structural systems\nwith a digital cellular solids pressure vessel design that consists of a carbon\nfiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) digital cellular solid cylindrical framework\nthat is lined with an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) skin.\nWe use the analytical treatment of a linear specific modulus scaling cellular\nsolid to find the minimum mass pressure vessel for a structure and find that,\nfor equivalent habitable volume and appropriate safety factors, the use of\ndigital cellular solids provides clear methods for producing structures that\nare not only repairable and reconfigurable, but also higher performance than\ntheir conventionally-manufactured counterparts.\n", "  Large assemblies of self-organized aluminum nanoclusters embedded in an oxide\nlayer are formed on graphene templates and used to build tunnel-junction\ndevices. Unexpectedly, single-electron-transport behavior with well-defined\nCoulomb oscillations is observed for a record junction area containing millions\nof metal islands. Such hybrid materials offer new prospects for single-electron\nelectronics.\n", "  A concise derivation of the \"Joel equations\", which allow for the\ndetermination of the axis angle 2V from measurements of extinction directions\non a spindle stage, is provided starting from the wave-equation. Only analytic\nmethods and no geometric arguments referring to stereographic projections are\ninvoked. For error free data, the resulting equations allow for a closed form\nsolution. If angle data with measurement error are to be used, a maximum\nlikelihood estimation methodology is proposed, which may be solved using e.g.\niterative reweighting. The method is tested with and compared to published\ndata.\n", "  A robust potential wherein is embedded the crucial core polarization\ninteraction is used in the Regge Pole methodology to calculate low energy\nelectron elastic scattering total cross section (TCS) for the C60 fullerene in\nthe electron impact energy range 0.02 through 10.0 eV. The energy position of\nthe characteristic dramatically sharp resonance appearing at the second\nRamsauer Townsend (RT) minimum of the TCS representing stable C60 fullerene\nnegative ion formation agrees excellently with the measured electron affinity\n(EA) of C60 [Huang et al 2014 J. Chem. Phys. 140 224315]. The benchmarked\npotential and the Regge-pole method are then used to calculate electron elastic\nscattering TCSs for selected fullerenes, from C54 through C240. The TCSs are\nfound to be characterized generally by RT minima, shape resonances (SRs) and\ndramatically sharp resonances representing long lived ground state fullerene\nnegative ion formation. For the TCSs of C70, C76, C78, and C84 the agreement\nbetween the energy positions of the very sharp resonances, corresponding to the\nbinding energies (BEs) of the resultant fullerene negative ions, and the\nmeasured EAs is outstanding. Additionally, we extract the BEs of the resultant\nfullerene negative ions from our calculated TCSs of the C86, C90 and C92\nfullerenes with estimated EAs larger than 3.0 eV by the experiment [Boltalina\net al, 1993 Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 7 1009] as well as of other\nfullerenes, including C180 and C240. Most of the TCSs presented in this paper\nare the first and only. Our novel approach is general and should be applicable\nto other fullerenes as well and complex heavy atoms, such as the lanthanide\natoms. We conclude with a remark on the catalytic properties of the fullerenes\nthrough their negative ions.\n", "  In Earth's mantle gravity instabilities initiated by density inversion lead\nto upwelling of hot materials as plumes. This study focuses upon the problem of\ntheir ascent dynamics to provide an explanation of the periodic multiple\neruption events in large igneous provinces and hotspots. We demonstrate from\nphysical experiments that plumes can ascend in a continuous process to form a\nsingle large head trailing into a long slender tail, typically described in the\nliterature only under specific physical conditions. Alternatively, they ascend\nin a pulsating fashion, and produce multiple in-axis heads of varying\ndimensions. Based on the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method, we performed\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to constrain the\nthermo-mechanical conditions that decide the continuous versus pulsating\ndynamics. Our CFD simulations suggest the density ($\\rho^*$) and the viscosity\n($R$) ratios of the ambient to the plume materials and the influx rates ($Re$)\nare the prime factors in controlling the ascent dynamics. Conditions with large\n$R$ ($>$50) develop pulsating plumes, which are sustained preferentially under\nlow $\\rho^*$ and $Re$ conditions. Again, the increasing temperature difference\nbetween the plume and the ambient medium is found to promote pulsating\nbehaviour. From these CFD simulations we show the thermal structures of a\nplume, and predict the peak thermal events near the surface that commence\nperiodically as pulses with a time interval of 1.4-3 Ma. The pulsating plume\nmodel explains the multiple eruption events in the Deccan Traps in India, where\nthe time scale of their intervals estimated from the available\n$^{40}Ar$/$^{39}Ar$ geochronological data shows an excellent match with our\nsimulation results.\n", "  By introducing four fundamental types of disorders into a two-dimensional\ntriangular lattice separately, we determine the role of each type of disorder\nin the vibration of the resulting mass-spring networks. We are concerned mainly\nwith the origin of the boson peak and the connection between the boson peak and\nthe transverse Ioffe-Regel limit. For all types of disorders, we observe the\nemergence of the boson peak and Ioffe-Regel limits. With increasing disorder,\nthe boson peak frequency $\\omega_{BP}$, transverse Ioffe-Regel frequency\n$\\omega_{IR}^T$, and longitudinal Ioffe-Regel frequency $\\omega_{IR}^L$ all\ndecrease. We find that there are two ways for the boson peak to form:\ndeveloping from and coexisting with (but remaining independent of) the\ntransverse van Hove singularity without and with local coordination number\nfluctuation. In the presence of a single type of disorder, $\\omega_{IR}^T\\ge\n\\omega_{BP}$, and $\\omega_{IR}^T\\approx \\omega_{BP}$ only when the disorder is\nsufficiently strong and causes spatial fluctuation of the local coordination\nnumber. Moreover, if there is no positional disorder, $\\omega_{IR}^T\\approx\n\\omega_{IR}^L$. Therefore, the argument that the boson peak is equivalent to\nthe transverse Ioffe-Regel limit is not general. Our results suggest that both\nlocal coordination number and positional disorder are necessary for the\nargument to hold, which is actually the case for most disordered solids such as\nmarginally jammed solids and structural glasses. We further combine two types\nof disorders to cause disorder in both the local coordination number and\nlattice site position. The density of vibrational states of the resulting\nnetworks resembles that of marginally jammed solids well. However, the relation\nbetween the boson peak and the transverse Ioffe-Regel limit is still indefinite\nand condition-dependent.\n", "  The epitaxial growth of multifunctional oxides on semiconductors has opened a\npathway to introduce new functionalities to semiconductor device technologies.\nIn particular, ferroelectric materials integrated on semiconductors could lead\nto low-power field-effect devices that can be used for logic and memory.\nEssential to realizing such field-effect devices is the development of\nferroelectric metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors, in which the\npolarization of a ferroelectric gate is coupled to the surface potential of a\nsemiconducting channel. Here we demonstrate that ferroelectric MOS capacitors\ncan be realized using single crystalline SrZrxTi1-xO3 (x = 0.7) that has been\nepitaxially grown on Ge. We find that the ferroelectric properties of\nSrZrxTi1-xO3 are exceptionally robust, as gate layers as thin as 5 nm\ncorresponding to an equivalent-oxide-thickness of just 1.0 nm exhibit a ~ 2 V\nhysteretic window in the capacitance-voltage characteristics. The development\nof ferroelectric MOS capacitors with nanoscale gate thicknesses opens new\nvistas for nanoelectronic devices.\n", "  This paper discusses questions of synthesizing and pressing vanadium oxides\nto create film-forming materials that can be used in producing optical\ncoatings. Based on the film-forming materials thus created, technological\nprocesses have been developed for fabricating coatings from vanadium dioxide by\ntwo methods of producing thin films: vacuum evaporation and magnetron\nsputtering. Questions of using films made from vanadium oxide in optical\ninstrumentation are considered.\n", "  A fast physics analysis framework has been developed based on SNiPER to\nprocess the increasingly large data sample collected by BESIII. In this\nframework, a reconstructed event data model with SmartRef is designed to\nimprove the speed of Input/Output operations, and necessary physics analysis\ntools are migrated from BOSS to SNiPER. A real physics analysis $e^{+}e^{-}\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}J/\\psi$ is used to test the new framework, and\nachieves a factor of 10.3 improvement in Input/Output speed compared to BOSS.\nFurther tests show that the improvement is mainly attributed to the new\nreconstructed event data model and the lazy-loading functionality provided by\nSmartRef.\n", "  Recently, the explosive phase transitions, such as explosive percolation and\nexplosive synchronization, have attracted extensive research interest. So far,\nmost existing works investigate Kuramoto-type models, where only phase\nvariables are involved. Here, we report the occurrence of explosive oscillation\nquenching in a system of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators that incorporates\nboth phase and amplitude dynamics. We observe three typical scenarios with\ndistinct microscopic mechanism of occurrence, i.e., ordinary, hierarchical, and\ncluster explosive oscillation death, corresponding to different frequency\ndistributions of oscillators, respectively. We carry out theoretical analyses\nand obtain the backward transition point, which is shown to be independent of\nthe specific frequency distributions. Numerical results are consistent with the\ntheoretical prediction.\n", "  In this paper, we report on the controllable negative differential resistance\n(NDR) in a proposed planar graphene superlattice structure. High value of peak\nto valley ratio (PVR) is predicted. This is significant because of appearance\nof NDR with high PVR at low biases. Our finding is important since beside the\nother potential applications of the graphene, proposes implementation of the\ngraphene based superlattice in electronic devices such as resonant tunneling\ndiode and filters.\n", "  The computational study of the interaction between charged, ligand-protected\nmetal nanoparticles and model lipid membranes has been recently addressed both\nat atomistic and coarse grained level. Here we compare the performance of three\nversions of the coarse grained Martini force field at describing the\nnanoparticle-membrane interaction. The three coarse-grained models differ in\nterms of treatment of long-range electrostatic interactions and water\npolarizability. The NP-membrane interaction consists in the transition from a\nmetastable NP- membrane complex, in which the NP is only partially embedded in\nthe membrane, to a configuration in which the NP is anchored to both membrane\nleaflets. All the three coarse grained models provide a description of the\nmetastable NP-membrane complex that is consistent with that obtained using an\natomistic force field. As for the anchoring transition, the polarizable- water\nMartini correctly describes the molecular mechanisms and the energetics of the\ntransition. The standard version of the Martini model, instead, underestimates\nthe free energy barriers for anchoring and does not completely capture the\nmembrane deformations involved in the transition process.\n", "  Many extensions of the SM contain hidden sectors which are uncharged under\nthe SM gauge group. The simplest model with an additional $U(1)$ group predicts\nthe existence of the new gauge boson, dark photon $Z_D$. In this work we\nconsider single production of dark photon $Z_D$ at the LHC and study its\ndiscovery potential via the process $pp\\rightarrow Z_D\\gamma\\rightarrow\nll\\gamma$. After simulating the signal as well as the relevant backgrounds, the\nnumerical results show that the signal of $Z_D$ might be detected at the 14TeV\nLHC.\n", "  Motivated by the potential prospects of the $B_{c}^{\\ast}$ meson samples at\nhadron colliders, the bottom-changing $B_{c}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$ ${\\psi}(1S,2S)P$,\n${\\eta}_{c}(1S,2S)P$ weak decays are first studied with the perturbative QCD\napproach, where $P$ $=$ ${\\pi}$ and $K$. It is found that branching ratio of\nthe CKM-favored $B_{c}^{\\ast}$ ${\\to}$ $J/{\\psi}{\\pi}$ decay is about ${\\sim}$\n${\\cal O}(10^{-8})$, which might be measurable at the future LHC experiments.\n", "  The search for a top quark in association with a Z boson can be performed in\nboth top pair production as well as single top production. Targeting the three\nlepton final state, the search can be used to identify the standard model (SM)\nprocess of a single top quark associated with a Z boson and to search for\nflavour changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions. The presented analysis\nuses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $19.7$\nfb$^{-1}$ recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. The cross section for the SM tZq production is measured to be\n$\\sigma(tZq\\rightarrow l\\nu bl^+ l^- q)= 10^{+8}_{-7}$ fb with a significance\nof $2.4 \\sigma$. Exclusion limits at 95$\\%$ confidence level on the branching\nratio of a top quark decaying to a Z boson and an up or charm quark are\ndetermined to be $BR(t \\rightarrow Zu) < 0.022\\%$ and $BR(t \\rightarrow Zc) <\n0.049\\%$ respectively.\n", "  While Newtonian gravity is an adequate model for current geophysical\nexploration, Einsteinian gravity, based on the connection between free fall and\nwarped time, has superseded Newtonian gravity as our best understanding of the\nuniverse. Einsteinian gravity is fundamental to GPS navigation and is a useful\ntool for geodesy. The Einstein-First Project is pioneering new curriculum\nmaterial that seeks to teach students, from ages 11 upwards, the Einsteinian\nparadigm for gravity. By developing models, analogies and classroom activity\nbased learning, we have found that students are fascinated and easily cope with\nconcepts that adults, indoctrinated with Euclidean-Newtonian concepts, find\ndifficult and confusing. This paper reviews the Einstein-First program, its\nmethods and results of studies with students. We show that the majority of\nstudents demonstrate improved conceptual understanding and improved attitude to\nphysics and that female students who enter the program with lower scores than\nmale students, increase their performance to be level with the male students.\n", "  The branching ratio and direct $CP$ asymmetry of the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$\n$B_{c}D_{s}$ weak decay are estimated with the perturbative QCD approach. It is\nfound that (1) The direct $CP$-violating asymmetry is close to zero. (2) the\nbranching ratio ${\\cal B}r({\\Upsilon}(1S){\\to}B_{c}D_{s})$ ${\\gtrsim}$\n$10^{-10}$ might be measurable at the future experiments.\n", "  We have developed a method to improve the doping computation efficiency, this\nmethod is based on first principles calculations and cluster expansion. First\nprinciples codes produce highly accurate total energies and optimized\ngeometries for any given structure. Cluster expansion method constructs a\ncluster expansion using partial first principles results and computes the\nenergies for other structures derived from a parent lattice. Using this method,\nenergies for multiple doping structures can be predicted quickly without series\nof first principles calculations. This method has been packaged into a tool\nnamed as CE Screen and integrated into MatCloud (A high-throughput first\nprinciples calculation platform). This makes the tool simple and easy for all\nthe users.\n", "  Quantum encryption is a well studied problem for both classical and quantum\ninformation. However, little is known about quantum encryption schemes which\nenable the user, under different keys, to learn different functions of the\nplaintext, given the ciphertext. In this paper, we give a novel one-bit\nsecret-key quantum encryption scheme, a classical extension of which allows\ndifferent key holders to learn different length subsequences of the plaintext\nfrom the ciphertext. We prove our quantum-classical scheme secure under the\nnotions of quantum semantic security, quantum entropic indistinguishability,\nand recent security definitions from the field of functional encryption.\n", "  A long-standing puzzle in the study of black-hole accretion concerns the\npresence or not of thermal instability. Classical theory predicts the\nencircling accretion disk is unstable, as do some self-consistent MHD\nsimulations of the flow. Yet observations of strongly accreting sources\ngenerally fail to exhibit cyclic or unstable dynamics on the expected\ntimescales. This paper checks whether turbulent fluctuations impede thermal\ninstability. It also asks if it makes sense to conduct linear stability\nanalyses on a turbulent background. These issues are explored with a set of MRI\nsimulations in thermally unstable local boxes in combination with stochastic\nequations that approximate the disk energetics. These models show that the\ndisk's thermal behaviour deviates significantly from laminar theory, though\nultimately a thermal runaway does occur. We find that the disk temperature\nevolves as a biased random walk, rather than increasing exponentially, and thus\ngenerates a broad spread of outcomes, with instability often delayed for\nseveral thermal times. We construct a statistical theory that describes some of\nthis behaviour, emphasising the importance of the `escape time' and its\nassociated probability distribution. In conclusion, turbulent fluctuations on\nthere own cannot stabilise a disk, but they can weaken and delay thermal\ninstability.\n", "  At the ILC, the luminosity-weighted average polarization at the IP needs to\nbe determined at the permille-level. In order to reach this goal, the combined\ninformation from the polarimeter and the collision data is required. In this\nstudy, a unified approach will be presented, which for the first time combines\nthe cross section measurements with the expected constraints from the\npolarimeters. Hereby, the statistical and systematical uncertainties are taken\ninto account, including their correlations. This study shows that a fast spin\nflip frequency is required because it easily reduces the systematic\nuncertainty, while a non-perfect helicity reversal can be compensated for\nwithin the unified approach. The final goal is to provide a realistic\nestimation of the luminosity-weighted average polarization at the IP to be used\nin the physic analyses.\n", "  We present an analysis of new physics searches in $Z\\,h$ with missing energy\nfinal states at the Large Hadron Collider considering $Z \\to l^+ l^-$ (where\n$l^\\pm = e^\\pm, \\mu^\\pm$) and $h \\to b\\bar b$ decay modes. For this analysis we\nconsider production of a $CP$-odd scalar $A$ through gluon-fusion which decay\ninto a heavy $CP$-even neutral scalar $H$ with $Z$-boson. Further $H$ decays\ninto a lighter $CP$-even Higgs boson $h$ in association with dark matter\ncandidate $\\chi$ - a source of missing energy. The masses of these scalars are\nconsidered as $m_h = 125$ GeV, $m_\\chi = 60$ GeV, $2 m_h < m_H < 2 m_t$ and\n$m_A > 2 m_t$. A data-driven method have been applied to reduce the\nconsiderable backgrounds from electroweak processes $W$+ jets and $Z$+ jets, in\naddition with top-pair and single-top production. The di-jet mass distributions\nhave been studied with same- and opposite-flavour lepton selections.\n", "  We report the transport properties of monolayer and bilayer graphene from\nfirst principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory (BTE). Our\nresistivity studies on monolayer graphene show Bloch-Gr${\\rm \\ddot{u}}$neisen\nbehavior in a certain range of chemical potentials. By substituting boron\nnitride in place of a carbon dimer of graphene, we predict a twofold increase\nin the Seebeck coefficient. A similar increase in the Seebeck coefficient for\nbilayer graphene under the influence of a small electric field $\\sim 0.3$ eV\nhas been observed in our calculations. Graphene with impurities shows a\nsystematic decrease of electrical conductivity and mobility. We have also\ncalculated the lattice thermal conductivities of monolayer graphene and bilayer\ngraphene using phonon BTE which show excellent agreement with experimental data\navailable in the temperature range 300-700\\ K.\n", "  We study a collection of polar self-propelled particles confined to a long\ntwo-dimensional channel. We write the coupled hydrodynamic equations of motion\nfor density and polarisation order parameter. At two confined boundaries,\ndensity is fixed to the mean and orientation is anti-parallel with fixed\nmagnitude of polarisation. Such boundary conditions make our system similar to\na sheared suspension of self-propelled particles, which has many practical\napplications. Antiparallel alignment at the two confined boundaries and\nalignment inside the channel create rolls of orientation along the long axis of\nthe channel. For zero self-propulsion speed, density and orientation fields are\ndecoupled and density remains homogeneous inside the channel. For finite\nself-propelled speed, density inhomogeneities develop and these rolls move\nalong the long axis of the channel. Density inhomogeneity increases sharply\nwith increasing the self propulsion speed and then reaches a maximum and again\ndecreases for very large speeds. Formation of rolls is very similar to the\nclassic problem of Rayleigh-Benard convection in fluid dynamics.\n", "  We discuss a comprehensive way to study the parameter degeneracies in the\nform of a generalized degeneracy in the neutrino oscillation experiments. First\nwe describe the various degeneracies by considering only neutrino run of the\nlong baseline experiment (LBL), NO$ \\nu $A. Then we discuss the role of\nantineutrinos. Later, we present the combined role of T2K (LBL experiment) and\nICAL@INO (atmospheric experiment) to resolve these degeneracies. We also\ndiscuss the affect of new physics like non-standards interactions (NSI) on the\ndetermination of neutrino mass hierarchy in DUNE.\n", "  The Fourier transform of the indicator function of arbitrary polygons and\npolyhedra is computed for complex wavevectors. Using the divergence theorem and\nStokes' theorem, closed expressions are obtained. Apparent singularities, all\nremovable, are discussed in detail. Loss of precision due to cancellation near\nthe singularities can be avoided by using series expansions.\n", "  The roles of applied strain and temperature on the hydration dynamics of\ncement paste are uncovered in the present study. We find that the system\nhardens over time through two different aging processes. The first process\ndominates the initial period of hydration and is characterized by the shear\nstress $\\sigma$ varying sub-linearly with the strain-rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$;\nduring this process the system is in a relatively low-density state and the\ninter-particle interactions are dominated by hydrodynamic lubrication. At a\nlater stage of hydration the system evolves to a high-density state where the\ninteractions become frictional, and $\\sigma$ varies super-linearly with\n$\\dot{\\gamma}$; this is identified as the second process. An instability,\nindicated by a drop in $\\sigma$, that is non-monotonic with $\\dot{\\gamma}$ and\ncan be tuned by temperature, separates the two processes. Both from rheology\nand microscopy studies we establish that the observed instability is related to\nfracture mechanics of space-filling structure.\n", "  We demonstrate rectification ratios ($RR$) of $\\gtrsim$1000 at biases of\n1.3~V in bilayers of \\buck deposited on copper. Using scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we show that the strong\ncoupling between \\buck and the Cu(111) surface leads to the metallization of\nthe bottom \\buck layer, while the molecular orbitals of the top \\buck are\nessentially unaffected. Due to this substrate-induced symmetry breaking and to\na tunneling transport mechanism, the system behaves as a hole-blocking layer,\nwith a spatial dependence of the onset voltage on intra-layer coordination.\nTogether with previous observations of strong electron-blocking character of\npentacene/\\buck bilayers on Cu(111), this work further demonstrates the\npotential of strongly-hybridized, \\buck-coated electrodes to harness the\nelectrical functionality of molecular components.\n", "  Education is increasingly being framed by a competence mindset; the value of\nknowledge lies much more in competence performativity and innovation than in\nsimply knowing. Reaching such competency in areas such as astronomy and physics\nhas long been known to be challenging. The movement from everyday conceptions\nof the world around us to a disciplinary interpretation is fraught with\npitfalls and problems. Thus, what underpins the characteristics of the\ndisciplinary trajectory to competence becomes an important educational\nconsideration. In this article we report on a study involving what students and\nlecturers discern from the same disciplinary semiotic resource. We use this to\npropose an Anatomy of Disciplinary Discernment (ADD), a hierarchy of what is\nfocused on and how it is interpreted in an appropriate, disciplinary manner, as\nan overarching fundamental aspect of disciplinary learning. Students and\nlecturers in astronomy and physics were asked to describe what they could\ndiscern from a video simulation of travel through our Galaxy and beyond. 137\npeople from nine countries participated. The descriptions were analysed using a\nhermeneutic interpretive study approach. The analysis resulted in the\nformulation of five qualitatively different categories of discernment; the ADD,\nreflecting a view of participants' competence levels. The ADD reveals four\nincreasing levels of disciplinary discernment: Identification, Explanation,\nAppreciation, and Evaluation. This facilitates the identification of a clear\nrelationship between educational level and the level of disciplinary\ndiscernment. The analytical outcomes of the study suggest how teachers of\nscience, after using the ADD to assess the students disciplinary knowledge, may\nattain new insights into how to create more effective learning environments by\nexplicitly crafting their teaching to support the crossing of boundaries in the\nADD model.\n", "  It is desirable to implement an efficient quantum information process\ndemanding fewer quantum resources. We designed two compact quantum circuits for\ndeterminately implementing four-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates on\nsingle-photon systems in both the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom\n(DoFs) via diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in resonators. The gates are\nheralded by the electron spins associated with the diamond NV centers. In\ncontrast to the ones with one DoF, our implementations reduce the quantum\nresource and are robust against the decoherence. Evaluations of fidelities and\nefficiencies of our gates show that our schemes may be implemented with current\ntechnology.\n", "  Stardust grains recovered from meteorites provide high-precision snapshots of\nthe isotopic composition of the stellar environment in which they formed.\nAttributing their origin to specific types of stars, however, often proves\ndifficult. Intermediate-mass stars of 4-8 solar masses are expected to\ncontribute a large fraction of meteoritic stardust. However, no grains have\nbeen found with characteristic isotopic compositions expected from such stars.\nThis is a long-standing puzzle, which points to serious gaps in our\nunderstanding of the lifecycle of stars and dust in our Galaxy. Here we show\nthat the increased proton-capture rate of $^{17}$O reported by a recent\nunderground experiment leads to $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O isotopic ratios that match\nthose observed in a population of stardust grains, for proton-burning\ntemperatures of 60-80 million K. These temperatures are indeed achieved at the\nbase of the convective envelope during the late evolution of intermediate-mass\nstars of 4-8 solar masses, which reveals them as the most likely site of origin\nof the grains. This result provides the first direct evidence that these stars\ncontributed to the dust inventory from which the Solar System formed.\n", "  The response of dynamical systems to varying conditions and disturbances is a\nfundamental aspect of their analysis. In spatially extended systems,\nparticularly in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible responses,\nincluding critical transitions, gradual transitions and locally confined\nresponses. Here, we use the context of vegetation dynamics in drylands in order\nto study the response of pattern-forming ecosystems to oscillating\nprecipitation and local disturbances. We focus on two precipitation ranges, a\nbistability range of bare soil with a patterned vegetation state, and a\nbistability range of uniform vegetation with a patterned vegetation state. In\nthese ranges, there are many different stable states, which allow for both\nabrupt and gradual transitions between the system states to occur. We find that\nlarge amplitude oscillations of the precipitation rate can lead to a collapse\nof the vegetation in one range, while in the other range, they result in the\nconvergence to a patterned state with a preferred wavelength. In addition, we\nshow that a series of local disturbances results in the collapse of the\nvegetation in one range, while it drives the system toward fluctuations around\na finite average biomass in the other range. Moreover, it is shown that under\ncertain conditions, local disturbances can actually increase the overall\nvegetation density. These significant differences in the system response are\nattributed to the existence of localized states in one of the bistability\nranges.\n", "  Multivariate clustering in astrophysics is a recent development justified by\nthe bigger and bigger surveys of the sky. The phylogenetic approach is probably\nthe most unexpected technique that has appeared for the unsupervised\nclassification of galaxies, stellar populations or globular clusters. On one\nside, this is a somewhat natural way of classifying astrophysical entities\nwhich are all evolving objects. On the other side, several conceptual and\npractical difficulties arize, such as the hierarchical representation of the\nastrophysical diversity, the continuous nature of the parameters, and the\nadequation of the result to the usual practice for the physical interpretation.\nMost of these have now been solved through the studies of limited samples of\nstellar clusters and galaxies. Up to now, only the Maximum Parsimony\n(cladistics) has been used since it is the simplest and most general\nphylogenetic technique. Probabilistic and network approaches are obvious\nextensions that should be explored in the future.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to explain how the views of Albert Einstein, John\nBell and others, about nonlocality and the conceptual issues raised by quantum\nmechanics, have been rather systematically misunderstood by the majority of\nphysicists.\n", "  Apollo-type NEA (3200) Phaethon, classified at the B/F-type taxonomy,\nprobably the main mass of the Phaethon-Geminid stream complex (PGC), can be the\nmost metamorphic C-complex asteroid in our solar system, since it is heated up\nto ~1000 K by the solar radiation around its perihelion passages. Hence, its\nsurface material may be easily decomposed in near-sun environment. Phaethon's\nspectrum exhibits extremely blue-slope in the VIS-NIR region (so-called\nPhaethon Blue). Another candidate large member of the PGC, (155140) 2005 UD,\nshows a B/F-type color, however with a C-type-like red color over its ~1/4\nrotational part, which implies an exposition of less metamorphosed primordial\ninternal structure of the PGC precursor by a splitting or breakup event long\nago. If so, some rotational part of Phaethon should show the C-type color as\nwell as 2005 UD. Hence, we carried out the time-series VIS-spectroscopic\nobservations of Phaethon using 1-m telescope in order to detect such a\nsignature. Also, R-band photometries were simultaneously performed in order to\ncomplement our spectroscopy. Consequently, we obtained a total of 68\nVIS-spectrophotometric data, 78% of which show the B-type blue-color, as\nagainst the rest of 22% showing the C-type red-color. We successfully acquired\nrotationally time-resolved spectroscopic data, of which particular rotational\nphase shows a red-spectral slope as the C-type color, as 2005 UD does,\nsuggesting longitudinal inhomogeneity on Phaethon's surface. We constrained\nthis C-type red-colored area in the mid-latitude in Phaethon's southern\nhemisphere based on the rotationally time-resolved spectroscopy along with\nPhaethon's axial rotation state, of which size suggests the impact-induced\norigin of the PGC. We also surveyed the meteoritic analog of Phaethon's surface\nblue-color, and found thermally metamorphosed CI/CM chondrites as likely\ncandidates.\n", "  The collapse of a spatial probability distribution is triggered by a\nmeasurement at a given spacetime point. It is customarily assumed that this\ncollapse occurs along an equal-time hypersurface, say, t = 0. However, such a\nna\\\"ive instantaneous collapse process is inconsistent with relativity, because\nthe equal-time hypersurfaces of different inertial reference frames are\ndifferent. The attempts at implementation of instantaneous collapse in several\ndifferent reference frames then lead to violations of probability conservation\nand violations of the scalar character of the probability contained in given\nvolume elements. This problem affects not only the Copenhagen interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, but also other interpretations in which it is still\nnecessary to specify what changes in probabilities occur when and where in a\nmanner consistent with relativistic spacetime geometry. In the 1980s Schlieder\nand Hellwig and Kraus proposed that collapse of the probability distribution\nalong the past light cone of the measurement point avoids these difficulties\nand leads to a Lorentz-invariant collapse scenario. Their proposal received\nlittle attention and some negative criticisms. In this paper I argue that the\nproposed past-light cone collapse is not only reasonable, but is compelled by\nLorentz invariance of probability conservation, and is equally valid for the\nspatial probability distributions in quantum mechanics and for those in a game\nof chance, for instance, the probability distribution for a game with playing\ncards scattered over some spatial region. I examine the objections that have\nbeen made to the past-light-cone collapse scenario and show that these\nobjections are not valid. Finally, I propose two possible interferometer\nexperiments that can serve as direct tests of past-light-cone collapse, one\nwith an atom interferometer, and the other with a light interferometer.\n", "  We present all the periodic Green function dyadics that enter a description\nof a 2d array of emitters at the level that includes the electric dipole,\nmagnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moment of each emitter. We find a\nconcise analytic form for the radiative contributions to the periodic Green\nfunction dyadics that give rise to radiation reaction fields, and we give the\nnon-radiative contributions that do not affect energy balance in the form of\nrapidly converging series. Finally, we present an approximation scheme for\nevaluating periodic Green function dyadics at long wavelengths that rigorously\nrespects energy conservation. The scheme extends the range of validity of the\nusual static approximation by the inclusion of a simple dynamic correction.\n", "  Nolinear Absorption of CT TFF+ aggregates in PMMA matrix was studied with\nresonant excitation around 800 nm in the femtoseconds regime with the Z-Scan\ntechnique with 100 Hz pulse repetition rate. The saturated absorption profiles\nwere fitted with a prepared formula based on steady state rate equations for a\nhomogeneous ensemble of two levels systems, thin samples and quasi\nmonochromatic field without the usual assumption of low saturation regime. The\nlifetime of the CT state, with the use of this model was estimated in hundred\nof fs, of the same order of magnitude of the exciting pulse.\n", "  We present new preliminary results for bag parameters and ratios of the BSM\nkaon mixing operators measured at the physical point. The results are obtained\nfrom simulations of domain wall fermion QCD with 2+1 flavours with an Iwasaki\ngauge, and now include pion and kaon masses very close to the physical point.\nWe compare these results to our collaboration's previous results obtained from\nheavier simulated quarks.\n", "  We use single-epoch spectroscopy of three gravitationally lensed quasars,\nHE0435-1223, WFI2033-4723, and HE2149-2745, to study their inner structure (BLR\nand continuum source). We detect microlensing-induced magnification in the\nwings of the broad emission lines of two of the systems (HE0435-1223 and\nWFI2033-4723). In the case of WFI2033-4723, microlensing affects two \"bumps\" in\nthe spectra which are almost symmetrically arranged on the blue (coincident\nwith an AlIII emission line) and red wings of CIII]. These match the typical\ndouble-peaked profile that follows from disk kinematics. The presence of\nmicrolensing in the wings of the emission lines indicates the existence of two\ndifferent regions in the BLR: a relatively small one with kinematics possibly\nrelated to an accretion disk, and another one that is substantially more\nextended and insensitive to microlensing. There is good agreement between the\nestimated size of the region affected by microlensing in the emission lines,\n$r_s=10^{+15}_{-7} \\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}$ light-days (red wing of CIV in\nHE0435-1223) and $r_s=11^{+28}_{-7} \\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}$ light-days (CIII] bumps\nin WFI2033-4723) with the sizes inferred from the continuum emission,\n$r_s=13^{+5}_{-4} \\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}$ light-days (HE0435-1223) and\n$r_s=10^{+3}_{-2} \\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}$ light-days (WFI2033-4723). For\nHE2149-2745 we measure an accretion disk size $r_s=8^{+11}_{-5}\n\\sqrt{M/M_{\\odot}}$ light-days. The estimates of $p$, the exponent of the size\nvs. wavelength ($r_s\\propto\\lambda^p$), are $1.2\\pm0.6$, $0.8\\pm0.2$, and\n$0.4\\pm0.3$ for HE0435-1223, WFI2033-4723, and HE2149-2745, respectively. In\nconclusion, the continuum microlensing amplitude in the three quasars and\nchromaticity in WFI2033-4723 and HE2149-2745 are below expectations for the\nthin disk model. The disks are larger and their temperature gradients are\nflatter than predicted by this model.\n", "  We have recently shown that both passive and active gravitational masses of a\ncomposite body are not equivalent to its energy due to some quantum effects. We\nhave also suggested an idealized and more realistic experiments to detect the\nabove mentioned inequivalence for a passive gravitational mass. The suggested\nidealized effect is as follows. A spacecraft moves protons of a macroscopic\nensemble of hydrogen atoms with constant velocity in the Earth's gravitational\nfield. Due to non-homogeneous squeezing of space by the field, electron ground\nstate wave function experiences time-dependent perturbation in each hydrogen\natom. This perturbation results in the appearance of a finite probability for\nan electron to be excited at higher energy levels and to emit a photon. The\nexperimental task is to detect such photons from the ensemble of the atoms.\nMore realistic variants of such experiment can be realized in solid crystals\nand nuclei, as first mentioned by us. In his recent Comment on our paper,\nCrowell has argued that the effect, suggested by us, contradicts the existing\nexperiments and, in particular, astronomic data. We show here that this\nconclusion is incorrect and based on the so-called \"free fall\" experiments,\nwhere our effect does not have to be observed.\n"]}
