"10.1007/PL00021669", "None", "None"], "abstract": ["  To improve the presentation we modified the title and used the framework of\nperturbation modeling of long-term dynamics so as to present the\nLorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation as the lowest order, asymptotic differential\nrelation for the velocity of a charged point-like mass. We formulated two\npropositions and added two references.\n", "  Materials with good carrier mobilities are desired for device applications,\nbut in real devices the mobilities are usually limited by the presence of\ninterfaces and contacts. Mobility degradation at semiconductor-dielectric\ninterfaces is generally attributed to defects at the interface or inside the\ndielectric, as is the case in Si/SiO2 structures, where processing does not\nintroduce detrimental defects in the semiconductor. In the case of SiC/SiO2\nstructures, a decade of research focused on reducing or passivating interface\nand oxide defects, but the low mobilities have persisted. By invoking\ntheoretical results and available experimental evidence, we show that thermal\noxidation generates carbon di-interstitial defects inside the semiconductor\nsubstrate and that they are a major cause of the poor mobility in SiC/SiO2\nstructures.\n", "  Using concepts of geometric orthogonality and linear independence, we\nlogically deduce the form of the Pauli spin matrices and the relationships\nbetween the three spatially orthogonal basis sets of the spin-1/2 system.\nRather than a mathematically rigorous derivation, the relationships are found\nby forcing expectation values of the different basis states to have the\nproperties we expect of a classical, geometric coordinate system. The process\nhighlights the correspondence of quantum angular momentum with classical\nnotions of geometric orthogonality, even for the inherently non-classical\nspin-1/2 system. In the process, differences in and connections between\ngeometrical space and Hilbert space are illustrated.\n", "  Photo-stimulated desorption (PSD) of Xe atoms from the Au(001) surface in\nthermal and nonthermal regimes was investigated by the time-of-flight\nmeasurement at photon energies of 6.4 and 2.3 eV. Xe was desorbed in a thermal\nway at high laser fluence, which was in good agreement with theoretical\nsimulations. At a low laser fluence, on the other hand, desorption was induced\nonly at a photon energy of 6.4 eV by a non-thermal one-photon process. We argue\nthat the nonthermal PSD occurs via transient formation of Xe- on Au(001). The\nlifetime of Xe- is estimated to be ~15 fs with a classical model calculation.\nWhereas the electron affinity of Xe is negative in the isolated state, it is\nstabilized by the metal proximity effect.\n", "  The oxidation of SiC and Si provide a unique opportunity for studying\noxidation mechanisms because the product is the same, SiO2. Silicon oxidation\nfollows a linear-parabolic law, with molecular oxygen identified as the\noxidant. SiC oxidation obeys the same linear-parabolic law but has different\nrates and activation energies and exhibits much stronger face-dependence. Using\nresults from first-principles calculations, we show that atomic and molecular\noxygen are the oxidant for Si- and C-face SiC respectively. Comparing SiC with\nSi, we elucidate how the interface controls the competition between atomic and\nmolecular mechanisms.\n", "  Laser induced thermal desorption of Xe atoms into vacuum from a metal surface\nfollowing the nano-second pulsed laser heating was investigated by the\ntime-of-flight (TOF) measurement. The desorption flow was studied at a wide\nrange of desorption flux by varying the initially prepared Xe coverage {\\Theta}\n(1 ML = 4.5*10^18 atoms/m^2). At {\\Theta} = 0.3 ML, the TOF of Xe was well\nrepresented by a Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution, which is in good\nagreement with thermal desorption followed by collision-free flow. At {\\Theta}\n> 0.3 ML, the peak positions of the TOF spectra were shifted towards the\nsmaller values and became constant at large {\\Theta}, which were well fitted\nwith a shifted Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution with a temperature T_D\nand a stream velocity u. With T_D fixed at 165 K, u was found to increase from\n80 to 125 m/ s with increasing {\\Theta} from 1.2 to 4 ML. At {\\Theta} > 4 ML,\nthe value of u become constant at 125 m/ s. The converging feature of u was\nfound to be consistent with analytical predictions and simulated results based\non the Knudsen layer formation theory. We found that the Knudsen layer\nformation in laser desorption is completed at Knudsen number Kn <0.39.\n", "  This paper is mainly devoted to lay an empirical foundation for further\nresearch on complex spatial dynamics of two-population interaction. Based on\nthe US population census data, a rural and urban population interaction model\nis developed. Subsequently a logistic equation on percentage urban is derived\nfrom the urbanization model so that spatial interaction can be connected\nmathematically with logistic growth. The numerical experiment by using the\ndiscretized urban-rural population interaction model of urbanization shows a\nperiod-doubling bifurcation and chaotic behavior, which is identical in\npatterns to those from the simple mathematical models of logistic growth in\necology. This suggests that the complicated dynamics of logistic growth may\ncome from some kind of the nonlinear interaction. The results from this study\nhelp to understand urbanization, urban-rural population interaction, chaotic\ndynamics, and spatial complexity of geographical systems.\n", "  Most theories that predict time and/or space variation of fundamental\nconstants also predict violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP).\nKhoury and Weltmann proposed the chameleon model in 2004 and claimed that this\nmodel avoids experimental bounds on WEP. We present a contrasting view based on\nan approximate calculation of the two body problem for the chameleon field and\nshow that the force depends on the test body composition. Furthermore, we\ncompare the prediction of the force on a test body with E\\\"otv\\\"os type\nexperiments and find that the chameleon field effect cannot account for current\nbounds.\n", "  A theory of quantum measurement was introduced some time ago that was based\non the notion of the so-called separation status. This separation status had a\nspatial, local character, so that the theory worked only in special cases.\nNevertheless, it enabled a description of state reduction process that was\nspecific in where, when and under which objective conditions the process occurs\nand that preserved the unitary transformation symmetry of quantum mechanics.\nNow, in an accompanying paper (arxiv:1411.5524), a completely general\nmathematical definition of the status is given and analyzed. The present paper\nreformulates the theory of state reduction accordingly. A general mathematical\nform of the process is postulated and illustrated by examples of Stern-Gerlach\nexperiment and of screening.\n", "  Exfoliated monolayer graphene flakes were embedded in a polymer matrix and\nloaded under axial compression. By monitoring the shifts of the 2D Raman\nphonons of rectangular flakes of various sizes under load, the critical strain\nto failure was determined. Prior to loading care was taken for the examined\narea of the flake to be free of residual stresses. The critical strain values\nfor first failure were found to be independent of flake size at a mean value of\n-0.60 % corresponding to a yield stress of -6 GPa. By combining Euler mechanics\nwith a Winkler approach, we show that unlike buckling in air, the presence of\nthe polymer constraint results in graphene buckling at a fixed value of strain\nwith an estimated wrinkle wavelength of the order of 1-2 nm. These results were\ncompared with DFT computations performed on analogue coronene/ PMMA oligomers\nand a reasonable agreement was obtained.\n", "  We calculate the wave-vector dependent electronic spin susceptibility\n$\\chi_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\mathbf q, \\mathbf H_0)$ of a d-wave superconductor in\nuniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}_0$ with Pauli pair-breaking. We find that\nthe transverse component of the susceptibility tensor can be greater than its\nnormal state value; the longitudinal component also slightly increases but in a\nvery limited range of $q$s. We identify several wave vectors $\\{\\mathbf\nq_\\perp,\\mathbf q_\\parallel\\}$, that correspond to the maxima of either\n$\\chi_\\perp$ or $\\chi_\\parallel$. We compare our results with available data on\nthe high-field phase in heavy-fermion CeCoIn$_5$.\n", "  We demonstrate effective background-free continuous wave nonlinear optical\nexcitation of molecules that are sandwiched between asymmetrically constructed\nplasmonic gold nanoparticle clusters. We observe that near infrared photons are\nconverted to visible photons through efficient plasmonic second harmonic\ngeneration. Our theoretical model and simulations demonstrate that Fano\nresonances may be responsible for being able to observe nonlinear conversion\nusing a continuous wave light source. We show that nonlinearity enhancement of\nplasmonic nanostructures via coupled quantum mechanical oscillators such as\nmolecules can be several orders larger as compared to their classical\ncounterparts.\n", "  We propose an $S_{4}$ flavor model based on supersymmetric (SUSY) SU(5) GUT.\nThe first and third generations of \\textbf{10} dimensional representations in\nSU(5) are all assigned to be $1_{1}$ of $S_{4}$. The second generation of\n\\textbf{10} is to be $1_{2}$ of $S_{4}$. Right-handed neutrinos of singlet\n\\textbf{1} and three generations of $\\bar{\\textbf{5}}$ are all assigned to be\n$3_{1}$ of $S_{4}$. The VEVs of two sets of flavon fields are allowed a\nmoderate hierarchy, that is $\\langle\\Phi^{\\nu}\\rangle \\sim\n\\lambda_{c}\\langle\\Phi^{e}\\rangle$. Tri-Bimaximal (TBM) mixing can be produced\nat both leading order (LO) and next to next to leading order (NNLO) in neutrino\nsector. All the masses of up-type quarks are obtained at LO. We also get the\nbottom-tau unification $m_{\\tau}=m_{b}$ and the popular Georgi-Jarlskog\nrelation $m_{\\mu}=3m_{s}$ as well as a new mass relation\n$m_{e}=\\frac{8}{27}m_{d}$ in which the novel Clebsch-Gordan (CG) factor arises\nfrom the adjoint field $H_{24}$. The GUT relation leads to a sizable mixing\nangle $\\theta^{e}_{12} \\sim \\theta_{c}$ and the correct quark mixing matrix\n$V_{CKM}$ can also be realised in the model. The resulting CKM-like mixing\nmatrix of charged leptons modifies the vanishing $\\theta^{\\nu}_{13}$ in TBM\nmixing to a large $\\theta^{PMNS}_{13}\\simeq\\theta_{c}/\\sqrt{2}$, in excellent\nagreement with experimental results. A Dirac CP violation phase\n$\\phi_{12}\\simeq\\pm\\pi/2$ is required to make the deviation from\n$\\theta^{\\nu}_{12}$ small. We also present some phenomenological numerical\nresults predicted by the model.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility of achieving the maximum possible singlet\nfraction using a entangled mixed two-qubit state as a resource. For this, we\nestablish a tight upper bound on singlet fraction and show that the maximal\nsinglet fraction obtained in \\cite{Verstraete} does not attain the obtained\nupper bound on the singlet fraction. Interestingly, we found that the required\nupper bound can in fact be achieved using local filtering operations.\n", "  Quantum teleportation circumvents the uncertainty principle using dual\nchannels: a quantum one consisting of previously-shared entanglement, and a\nclassical one, together allowing the disembodied transport of an unknown\nquantum state over distance. It has recently been shown that a classical bit\ncan be counterfactually communicated between two parties in empty space,\n\"Alice\" and \"Bob\". Here, by using our \"dual\" version of the chained quantum\nZeno effect to achieve a counterfactual CNOT gate, we propose the first\nprotocol for transporting an unknown qubit counterfactually, that is without\nany physical particles travelling between Alice and Bob - no classical channel\nand no previously-shared entanglement.\n", "  We assume the spacetime foam picture in which vacuum is filled with virtual\nwormholes. In the presence of an external field the distribution of wormholes\nchanges. We consider an anisotropic distribution of wormholes and analyze its\nrelation to the speed of light. We show that speed of light acquires an\nanisotropic character and save the normal dispersion a gas of virtual wormholes\nmay possess also an anomalous dispersion, i.e., when the light velocity exceeds\nthat in the vacuum.\n", "  We present the results of an analytical and numerical study of the long-time\nbehavior for certain Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattices viewed as perturbations of\nthe completely integrable Toda lattice. Our main tools are the direct and\ninverse scattering transforms for doubly-infinite Jacobi matrices, which are\nwell-known to linearize the Toda flow. We focus in particular on the evolution\nof the associated scattering data under the perturbed vs. the unperturbed\nequations. We find that the eigenvalues present initially in the scattering\ndata converge to new, slightly perturbed eigenvalues under the perturbed\ndynamics of the lattice equation. To these eigenvalues correspond solitary\nwaves that emerge from the solitons in the initial data. We also find that new\neigenvalues emerge from the continuous spectrum as the lattice system is let to\nevolve under the perturbed dynamics.\n", "  We investigated the effect of surfactants and their concentration (Csur) on\nthe final graphene concentration (CG) via the liquid-phase exfoliation method.\nSix typical surfactants including ionic and non-ionic ones were explored and\nthe optimized Csur for each surfactant was suggested. For ionic surfactants, CG\nincreases with Csur before reaching its maximum and then maintains the high\nlevel. The different mechanisms of ionic and non-ionic surfactants in\nstabilizing graphene dispersions are explained by the theory for colloidal\nstability. The as-prepared graphene sheets are verified to be highly exfoliated\nthrough transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies,\nwhile the defect-free structure was evidenced by Raman spectra and X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy.\n", "  We provide a twofold extension of Landau--Pollak uncertainty relations for\nmixed quantum states and for positive operator-valued measures, by recourse to\ngeometric considerations. The generalization is based on metrics between pure\nstates, having the form of a function of the square of the inner product\nbetween the states. The triangle inequality satisfied by such metrics plays a\ncrucial role in our derivation. The usual Landau--Pollak inequality is thus a\nparticular case (derived from Wootters metric) of the family of inequalities\nobtained, and, moreover, we show that it is the most restrictive relation\nwithin the family.\n", "  Given the importance of future large scale structure surveys for delivering\nnew cosmological information, it is crucial to reliably predict their\nobservables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS)\nprovides a manifestly convergent perturbative scheme to compute the clustering\nof dark matter in the weakly nonlinear regime in an expansion in $k/k_{\\rm\nNL}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber of interest and $k_{\\rm NL}$ is the\nwavenumber associated to the nonlinear scale. It has been recently shown that\nthe EFTofLSS matches to $1\\%$ level the dark matter power spectrum at redshift\nzero up to $k\\simeq 0.3 h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ and $k\\simeq 0.6 h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ at one\nand two loops respectively, using only one counterterm that is fit to data.\nSimilar results have been obtained for the momentum power spectrum at one loop.\nThis is a remarkable improvement with respect to former analytical techniques.\nHere we study the prediction for the equal-time dark matter bispectrum at one\nloop. We find that at this order it is sufficient to consider the same\ncounterterm that was measured in the power spectrum. Without any remaining free\nparameter, and in a cosmology for which $k_{\\rm NL}$ is smaller than in the\npreviously considered cases ($\\sigma_8=0.9$), we find that the prediction from\nthe EFTofLSS agrees very well with $N$-body simulations up to $k\\simeq 0.25\nh\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, given the accuracy of the measurements, which is of order a few\npercent at the highest $k$'s of interest. While the fit is very good on average\nup to $k\\simeq 0.25 h\\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, the fit performs slightly worse on\nequilateral configurations, in agreement with expectations that for a given\nmaximum $k$, equilateral triangles are the most nonlinear.\n", "  A simplified numerical model has been developed to simulate non-linear\nsuperconducting radiofrequency (SRF) losses on Nb surfaces. This study focuses\nexclusively on excessive surface resistance (Rs) losses due to the microscopic\ntopographical magnetic field enhancements. When the enhanced local surface\nmagnetic field exceeds the superconducting critical transition magnetic field\nHc, small volumes of surface material may become normal conducting and increase\nthe effective surface resistance without inducing a quench. Using topographic\ndata from typical Buffered Chemical Polish (BCP) and Electropolish (EP) treated\nfine grain niobium , we have estimated the resulting field-dependent losses and\nextrapolated this model to the implications for cavity performance. The model\npredictions correspond well to the characteristic BCP versus EP high field Q0\nperformance differences for fine grain niobium. We describe the algorithm of\nthe model, its limitations, and the effects of this non-linear loss\ncontribution on SRF cavity performance.\n", "  During this work, using subtraction renormalization mechanism, zero point\nquantum fluctuations for bosonic scalar fields in a de-Sitter like background\nare investigated. By virtue of the observed value for spectral index, $n_s(k)$,\nfor massive scalar field the best value for the first slow roll parameter,\n$\\epsilon$, is achieved. In addition the energy density of vacuum quantum\nfluctuations for massless scalar field is obtained. The effects of these\nfluctuations on other components of the Universe are studied. By solving the\nconservation equation, for some different examples, the energy density for\ndifferent components of the Universe are obtained. In the case which, all\ncomponents of the Universe are in an interaction, the different dissipation\nfunctions, $\\tilde{Q}_{i}$, are considered. The time evolution of\n${\\rho_{DE}(z)}/{\\rho_{cri}(z)}$ shows that $\\tilde{Q}=3 \\gamma H(t) \\rho_{m}$\nhas best agreement in comparison to observational data including CMB, BAO and\nSNeIa data set.\n", "  The study of scattering processes in few body systems is a difficult problem\nespecially if long range interactions are involved. In order to solve such\nproblems, we develop here a potential-splitting approach for three body\nsystems. This approach is based on splitting the reaction potential into a\nfinite range core part and a long range tail part. The solution to the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for the long range tail Hamiltonian is found\nanalytically, and used as an incoming wave in the three body scattering\nproblem. This reformulation of the scattering problem makes it suitable for\ntreatment by the exterior complex scaling technique in the sense that the\nproblem after the complex dilation is reduced to a boundary value problem with\nzero boundary conditions. We illustrate the method with calculations on the\nelectron scattering off the hydrogen atom and the positive helium ion in the\nframe of the Temkin-Poet model.\n", "  A semiclassical formulation of the spin Hall effect for physical systems\nsatisfying Dirac-like equation is introduced. We demonstrated that the main\ncontribution to the spin Hall conductivity is given by the spin Chern number\nwhether the spin is conserved or not at the quantum level. We illustrated the\nformulation within the Kane-Mele model of graphene in the absence and in the\npresence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling term.\n", "  We calculate the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ radiative corrections to the spin\ndependent differential decay rates of the process $t\\rightarrow b+W^+$. These\nare needed to study the angular distribution of the energy of hadrons produced\nin polarized top quark decays at next-to-leading order (NLO). In our previous\nwork, we studied the angular distribution of the scaled-energy of\nbottom-flavored hadrons (B) from polarized top quark decays, using a specific\nhelicity coordinate system where the top quark spin was measured relative to\nthe bottom momentum (system~1). Here, we study the angular distribution of the\nenergy spectrum of B-hadron in a different helicity system, where the top spin\nis specified relative to the W-momentum (system~2). These energy distributions\nare governed by the polarized and unpolarized rate functions which are related\nto the density matrix elements of the decay $t\\rightarrow W^++b$. Through this\npaper, we present our predictions of the B-hadron spectrum in the polarized and\nunpolarized top decay and shall compare the polarized results in two different\nhelicity systems. These predictions can be used to determine the polarization\nstates of top quarks and also provide direct access to the B-hadron\nfragmentation functions (FFs) and allow us to deepen our knowledge of the\nhadroniazation process.\n", "  The Hamiltonian constraint Hc = NH = 0, defines a diffeomorphic structure on\nspatial manifolds by the lapse function N in general theory of relativity.\nHowever, it is not manifest in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity, since the expression\nfor velocity in terms of the momentum is multivalued. Thus the Hamiltonian is a\nbranch function of momentum. Here we propose an extended theory of\nLanczos-Lovelock gravity to construct a unique Hamiltonian in its\nminisuperspace version, which results in manifest diffeomorphic invariance and\ncanonical quantization.\n", "  A complete apparatus is defined as reacting to every state of the measured\nsystem. Standard quantum mechanics of indistinguishable particles is shown to\nimply that apparatuses must be incomplete or else they would be drowned out by\nnoise. Each quantum observable is then an abstract representation of many\nmeasurement apparatuses, each incomplete in a different way. Moreover, a\nmeasured system must be prepared in a state that is orthogonal to the states of\nall particles of the same type in the environment. This is the main purpose of\npreparations. A system so prepared is said to have a \"separation status\". A\nnew, more satisfactory definition of separation status than the spatial one\nproposed in previous papers then results. Conditions are specified under which\nthe particles in the environment may be ignored as is usually done in the\ntheory of measurement.\n", "  We discuss the discovery potential of light-by-light scattering at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC), induced by the Standard Model (SM) and by new exotic\ncharged particles. Our simulation relies on intact proton detection in the\nplanned forward detectors of CMS and ATLAS. The full four-photon amplitudes\ngenerated by any electrically charged particles of spins $1/2$ and $1$,\nincluding the SM processes involving loops of leptons, quarks and $W$ bosons\nare implemented in the Forward Physics Monte Carlo generator. Our method\nprovides model-independent bounds on massive charged particles, only\nparametrized by the spin, mass and \"effective charge\" $Q_{\\rm eff}$ of the new\nparticle. We find that a new charged vector (fermion) with $Q_{\\rm eff}=4$ can\nbe discovered up to $m=640~\\rm GeV$ ($m=300~\\rm GeV$) with an integrated\nluminosity of $300~\\rm fb^{-1}$ at the LHC. We also discuss the sensitivities\nto neutral particles such as a strongly-interacting heavy dilaton and warped\nKaluza-Klein gravitons, whose effects could be discovered for masses in the\nmulti-TeV range.\n", "  We propose a new realization of axion monodromy inflation in which axion\nmonodromy arises from torsional cycles in a type IIB compactification. A class\nof monomial potentials is obtained with specific values for the power index.\nMoreover, the inflaton mass changes profile due to the couplings between\nvarious fields after compactification. Consequently, the potential obtains a\nstep-like profile at some critical scale. We study the cosmological\nimplications of one concrete realization of this model. At the background\nlevel, it realizes a sufficiently long inflationary stage, which allows for the\nviolation of the slow-roll conditions for a short period of time when the\ninflaton is close to the critical scale. Accordingly, the Hubble horizon is\nperturbed and affects the dynamics of primordial cosmological perturbations. In\nparticular, we analyze the angular power spectrum of B-mode polarization and\nfind a boost on very large scales. We also find that the amplitude of scalar\nperturbations is suppressed near the critical scale. Thus our model provides an\ninterpretation for the low-$\\ell$ suppression of temperature anisotropies in\nthe CMB power spectrum. We examine these effects and confront the model to\nobservations.\n", "  We build constructively the simplest tensor field theory which requires some\nrenormalization, namely the rank three tensor theory with quartic interactions\nand propagator inverse of the Laplacian on $U(1)^3$. This superrenormalizable\ntensor field theory has a power counting almost similar to ordinary $\\phi^4_2$.\nOur construction uses the multiscale loop vertex expansion (MLVE) recently\nintroduced in the context of an analogous vector model. However to prove\nanalyticity and Borel summability of this model requires new estimates on the\nintermediate field integration, which is now of matrix rather than of scalar\ntype.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the approximate decomposition of diagonal\noperators, focusing specifically on decompositions over the Clifford+$T$ basis,\nthat minimize the number of phase-rotation gates in the synthesized\napproximation circuit. The equivalent $T$-count of the synthesized circuit is\nbounded by $k \\, C_0 \\log_2(1/\\varepsilon) + E(n,k)$, where $k$ is the number\nof distinct phases in the diagonal $n$-qubit unitary, $\\varepsilon$ is the\ndesired precision, $C_0$ is a quality factor of the implementation method\n($1<C_0<4$), and $E(n,k)$ is the total entanglement cost (in $T$ gates). We\ndetermine an optimal decision boundary in $(k,n,\\varepsilon)$-space where our\ndecomposition algorithm achieves lower entanglement cost than previous\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques\nfor a practical range of $\\varepsilon$ values and diagonal operators and can\nreduce the number of $T$ gates exponentially in $n$ when $k << 2^n$.\n", "  We develop an exact analytical formulation of neutrino oscillations in matter\nwithin the framework of the Standard Neutrino Model assuming 3 Dirac Neutrinos.\nOur Hamiltonian formulation, which includes CP violation, leads to expressions\nfor the partial oscillation probabilities that are linear combinations of\nspherical Bessel functions in the eigenvalue differences. The coefficients of\nthese Bessel functions are polynomials in the neutrino CKM matrix elements, the\nneutrino mass differences squared, the strength of the neutrino interaction\nwith matter, and the neutrino mass eigenvalues in matter. We give exact\nclosed-form expressions for all partial oscillation probabilities in terms of\nthese basic quantities. Adopting the Standard Neutrino Model, we then examine\nhow the exact expressions for the partial oscillation probabilities might\nsimplify by expanding in one of the small parameters {\\alpha} and sin{\\theta}13\nof this model. We show explicitly that for small {\\alpha} and sin{\\theta}13\nthere are branch points in the analytic structure of the eigenvalues that lead\nto singular behavior of expansions near the solar and atmospheric resonances.\nWe present numerical calculations that indicate how to use the small-parameter\nexpansions in practice.\n", "  Under the steady state condition, the spectrum of electrons is investigated\nby solving the continuity equation under the complex radiation of both the\nsynchrotron and Compton processes. The resulted GRB spectrum is a broken power\nlaw in both the fast and slow cooling phases. On the basis of this electron\nspectrum, the spectral indices of the Band function in four different phases\nare presented. In the complex radiation frame, the detail investigation on\nphysical parameters reveals that both the reverse shock photosphere model and\nthe forward shock with strong coupling model can answer the $\\alpha \\sim -1$\nproblem. A possible marginal to fast cooling phase transition in GRB 080916C is\ndiscussed. The time resolved spectra in different pulses of GRB 100724B, GRB\n100826A and GRB 130606B are investigated. We found that the flux is\nproportional to the peak energy in almost all pulses. The phases for different\npulses are determined according to the spectral index revolution. We found the\nstrong correlations between spectral indices and the peak energy in GRB\n100826A, which can be explained by the Compton effect in the fast cooling\nphase. However, the complex scenario predicts a steeper index for the injected\nelectrons, which challenges the acceleration mechanism in GRBs.\n", "  We consider the Maxwell field in the exterior of a Kerr black hole. For this\nsystem, we propose a geometric construction of generalized Klein-Gordon\nequation called Fackerell-Ipser equation. Our model is based on conformal\nYano-Kiling tensor (CYK tensor). We present non-standard properties of CYK\ntensors in the Kerr spacetime which are useful in electrodynamics.\n", "  The solvent casted Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)\nblend was recrystallized by the thermal treatment of a heating and cooling\ncycle. The high PEG content blend (30\\%wt) showed a striking dispersion\nbehavior, that the materials rapidly dispersed and dissolved in the aqueous\nenvironment in a few hours. This phenomenon has not been reported by others,\nand was not observed in low PEG content samples of 5\\%, 10\\%, and 20\\%, or\nquenched(amorphous) samples. We hypothesized the mechanism that the chain\nrearrangement during the thermal treatment leads to the phase separation. And\nwith the phase separation in the recrystallized samples, the PEG potions\nrapidly dissolved in the aqueous environment, left out the small PLA\nspherulites being separated and dispersed in the solution. The same underlying\nreason can also be inferred from the degradation behaviors of other samples.\nCharacterizations of DSC, XRD, and SEM have been done to validate our\nhypothesis.\n", "  Many systems comprising entities in interactions can be represented as\ngraphs, whose structure gives significant insights about how these systems\nwork. Network theory has undergone further developments, in particular in\nrelation to detection of communities in graphs, to catch this structure.\nRecently, an approach has been proposed to transform a graph into a collection\nof signals: Using a multidimensional scaling technique on a distance matrix\nrepresenting relations between vertices of the graph, points in a Euclidean\nspace are obtained and interpreted as signals, indexed by the vertices. In this\narticle, we propose several extensions to this approach, developing a framework\nto study graph structures using signal processing tools. We first extend the\ncurrent methodology, enabling us to highlight connections between properties of\nsignals and graph structures, such as communities, regularity or randomness, as\nwell as combinations of those. A robust inverse transformation method is next\ndescribed, taking into account possible changes in the signals compared to\noriginal ones. This technique uses, in addition to the relationships between\nthe points in the Euclidean space, the energy of each signal, coding the\ndifferent scales of the graph structure. These contributions open up new\nperspectives in the study of graphs, by enabling processing of graphs through\nthe processing of the corresponding collection of signals, using reliable tools\nfrom signal processing. A technique of denoising of a graph by filtering of the\ncorresponding signals is then described, suggesting considerable potential of\nthe approach.\n", "  We propose a general scheme determining the quantum pointer basis of a\nmacroscopic object interacting with environment. Unlike the decoherence\nprogram, our pointer basis does not require robustness against entanglement,\nbut require robustness on the object state itself. The proposed pointer basis\ndoes not rely on master equations, and so is easily calculable since it has a\ntime-local analytic formula. We show that, as a convincing example, the\nproposed formula gives an satisfactory pointer basis of a macroscopic flying\nbody such as a bullet whose pointer states should have well-defined momentum as\nwell as highly-localized position.\n", "  Elements of a novel theory of quantum physics are developed, synthesising the\nrole of symbolism in describing quantum measurement and in the topological\nrepresentation of fractal invariant sets in nonlinear dynamical systems theory.\nIn this synthesis, the universe $U$ is treated as an isolated deterministic\ndynamical system evolving precisely on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset\n$I_U$ of its state space. A non-classical approach to the physics of $U$ is\ndeveloped by treating the geometry of $I_U$ as more primitive than dynamical\nevolution equations on $I_U$. A specific symbolic representation of $I_U$ is\nconstructed which encodes quaternionic multiplication and from which the\nstatistical properties of complex Hilbert Space vectors are emergent. The\nHilbert Space itself arises as the singular limit of Invariant Set Theory as a\nfractal parameter $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. Although the Hilbert Space of quantum\ntheory is counterfactually complete, the measure-zero set $I_U$ is\ncounterfactually incomplete, no matter how large is $N$. Such incompleteness\nallows reinterpretations of familiar quantum phenomena, consistent with realism\nand local causality. The non-computable nature of $I_U$ ensures that these\nreinterpretations are neither conspiratorial nor retrocausal and, through a\nhomeomorphism with the ring of $2^N$-adic integers, are robust to noise and\nhence not fine tuned. The non-commutativity of Hilbert Space observables\nemerges from the symbolic representation of $I_U$ through the generic\nnumber-theoretic incommensurateness of $\\phi/\\pi$ and $\\cos \\phi$. Invariant\nSet Theory implies a much stronger synergy between cosmology and quantum\nphysics than exists in contemporary theory, suggesting a novel approach to\nsynthesising gravitational and quantum physics and providing new perspectives\non the dark universe and information loss in black holes.\n", "  The experimental search for new thermoelectric materials remains largely\nconfined to a limited set of successful chemical and structural families, such\nas chalcogenides, skutterudites, and Zintl phases. In principle, computational\ntools such as density functional theory (DFT) offer the possibility of\nrationally guiding experimental synthesis efforts toward very different\nchemistries. However, in practice, predicting thermoelectric properties from\nfirst principles remains a challenging endeavor, and experimental researchers\ngenerally do not directly use computation to drive their own synthesis efforts.\nTo bridge this practical gap between experimental needs and computational\ntools, we report an open machine learning-based recommendation engine\n(http://thermoelectrics.citrination.com) for materials researchers that\nsuggests promising new thermoelectric compositions, and evaluates the\nfeasibility of user-designed compounds. We show that this engine can identify\ninteresting chemistries very different from known thermoelectrics.\nSpecifically, we describe the experimental characterization of one example set\nof compounds derived from our engine, RE12Co5Bi (RE = Gd, Er), which exhibits\nsurprising thermoelectric performance given its unprecedentedly high loading\nwith metallic d and f block elements, and warrants further investigation as a\nnew thermoelectric material platform.\n", "  We use a popular fictional disease, zombies, in order to introduce techniques\nused in modern epidemiology modelling, and ideas and techniques used in the\nnumerical study of critical phenomena. We consider variants of zombie models,\nfrom fully connected continuous time dynamics to a full scale exact stochastic\ndynamic simulation of a zombie outbreak on the continental United States. Along\nthe way, we offer a closed form analytical expression for the fully connected\ndifferential equation, and demonstrate that the single person per site two\ndimensional square lattice version of zombies lies in the percolation\nuniversality class. We end with a quantitative study of the full scale US\noutbreak, including the average susceptibility of different geographical\nregions.\n", "  The superradiant stability is investigated for non-extremal\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole. We use an algebraic method to demonstrate that\nall non-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes are superradiantly stable\nagainst a charged massive scalar perturbation. This improves the results\nobtained before for non-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.\n", "  Memristive switching in polycrystalline materials is widely attributed to the\nformation and rupture of conducting filaments, believed to be mediated by\noxygen-vacancy redistribution. The underlying atomic-scale processes are still\nunknown, however, which limits device modeling and design. Here we combine\nexperimental data with multi-scale calculations to elucidate the entire\natomic-scale cycle in undoped polycrystalline BiFeO3. Conductive atomic force\nmicroscopy reveals that the grain boundaries behave like two-dimensional\nnanovaristors while, on the return part of the cycle, the decreasing current is\nthrough the grains. Using density-functional-theory and Monte-Carlo\ncalculations we deduce the atomic-scale mechanism of the observed phenomena.\nOxygen vacancies in non-equilibrium concentrations are initially distributed\nrelatively uniformly, but they are swept into the grain boundaries by an\nincreasing voltage. A critical voltage, the SET voltage, then eliminates the\nbarrier for hopping conduction through vacancy energy levels in grain\nboundaries. On the return part of the cycle, the grain boundaries are again\nnon-conductive, but the grains show nonzero conductivity by virtue of remote\ndoping by oxygen vacancies. The RESET voltage amounts to a heat pulse that\nredistributes the vacancies. The realization that nanovaristors are at the\nheart of memristive switching in polycrystalline materials may open\npossibilities for novel devices and circuits.\n", "  Memristive switching serves as the basis for a new generation of electronic\ndevices. Memristors are two-terminal devices in which the current is turned on\nand off by redistributing point defects, e.g., vacancies, which is difficult to\ncontrol. Memristors based on alternative mechanisms have been explored, but\nachieving both the high On/Off ratio and the low switching energy desirable for\nuse in electronics remains a challenge. Here we report memristive switching in\na La0.7Ca0.3MnO3/PrBa2Cu3O7 bilayer with an On/Off ratio greater than 10^3 and\ndemonstrate that the phenomenon originates from a new type of interfacial\nmagnetoelectricity. Using results from first-principles calculations, we show\nthat an external electric-field induces subtle displacements of the interfacial\nMn ions, which switches on/off an interfacial magnetic \"dead\" layer, resulting\nin memristive behavior for spin-polarized electron transport across the\nbilayer. The interfacial nature of the switching entails low energy cost about\nof a tenth of atto Joule for write/erase a \"bit\". Our results indicate new\nopportunities for manganite/cuprate systems and other transition-metal-oxide\njunctions in memristive applications.\n", "  MOSFETs based on wide band-gap semiconductors are suitable for operations at\nhigh temperature, at which additional atomic-scale processes that are benign at\nlower temperatures can get activated which results in device degradation.\nRecently significant enhancement of electron trapping was observed under\npositive bias in SiC MOSFETs at temperatures higher than 150{\\deg}C. Here we\nreport first-principle calculations showing that the enhanced electron trapping\nis associated with thermally activated capturing of a second electron by an\noxygen vacancy in SiO2, by which the vacancy transforms into a new structure\nthat comprises one Si dangling bond and a bond between a five-fold and a\nfour-fold Si atoms. The results suggest a key role of oxygen vacancies and\ntheir structural reconfigurations in the reliability of high-temperature MOS\ndevices.\n", "  Physisorbed Kr layers on TiO$_{2}$(110) surfaces were investigated by means\nof nuclear resonant scattering (NRS) of synchrotron radiation at Kr thicknesses\nranging from multilayer to monolayer. The NRS intensity was measured as a\nfunction of the Kr exposure, from which the NRS signal corresponding to\nmonolayer was estimated as 0.23 cps. The time spectra measured at various\nthicknesses showed a monotonous decay without any quantum beat features. The\nrecoiless fraction $f$ evaluated from the analysis of the time spectrum\nrevealed a substantial reduction upon temperature rise from 19 to 25 K. As its\norigin, an order-disorder phase transition of the monolayer Kr is proposed.\n", "  A class of anyonic models for universal quantum computation based on\nweakly-integral anyons has been recently proposed. While universal set of gates\ncannot be obtained in this context by anyon braiding alone, designing a certain\ntype of sector charge measurement provides universality. In this paper we\ndevelop a compilation algorithm to approximate arbitrary $n$-qutrit unitaries\nwith asymptotically efficient circuits over the metaplectic anyon model. One\nflavor of our algorithm produces efficient circuits with upper complexity bound\nasymptotically in $O(3^{2\\,n} \\, \\log{1/\\varepsilon})$ and entanglement cost\nthat is exponential in $n$. Another flavor of the algorithm produces efficient\ncircuits with upper complexity bound in $O(n\\,3^{2\\,n} \\, \\log{1/\\varepsilon})$\nand no additional entanglement cost.\n", "  The phase space analysis of cosmological parameters $\\Omega_{\\phi}$ and\n$\\gamma_{\\phi}$ is given. Based on this, the well-known quintessence cosmology\nis studied with an exponential potential $V(\\phi)=V_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda\\phi)$.\nGiven observational data, the current state of universe could be pinpointed in\nthe phase diagrams, thus making the diagrams more informative. The scaling\nsolution of quintessence usually is not supposed to give the cosmic\naccelerating expansion, but we prove it could educe the transient acceleration.\nWe also find that the differential equations of system used widely in study of\nscalar field are incomplete, and then a numerical method is used to figure out\nthe range of application.\n", "  We present a lattice QCD calculation of the $B \\rightarrow D l \\nu$\nsemileptonic decay form factors $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ for the entire\nphysical $q^2$ range. Non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) bottom quarks and Highly\nImproved Staggered Quark (HISQ) charm and light quarks are employed together\nwith $N_f = 2+1$ MILC gauge configurations. A joint fit to our lattice and\nBaBar experimental data allows an extraction of the CKM matrix element\n$|V_{cb}|$. We also determine the phenomenologically interesting ratio $R(D) =\n{\\cal B}(B \\rightarrow D \\tau \\nu_\\tau) / {\\cal B}(B \\rightarrow D l \\nu_l)$\n($l = e, \\mu$). We find $|V_{cb}|_{excl.}^{B \\rightarrow D} = 0.0402(17)(13)$,\nwhere the first error consists of the lattice simulation errors and the\nexperimental statistical error and the second error is the experimental\nsystematic error. For the branching fraction ratio we find $R(D) = 0.300(8)$.\n", "  We investigate the effects of a K-mouflage modification of gravity on the\ndynamics of clusters of galaxies. We extend the description of K-mouflage to\nsituations where the scalar field responsible for the modification of gravity\nis coupled to a perfect fluid with pressure. We describe the coupled system at\nboth the background cosmology and cosmological perturbations levels, focusing\non cases where the pressure emanates from small-scale nonlinear physics. We\nderive these properties in both the Einstein and Jordan frames, as these two\nframes already differ by a few percents at the background level for K-mouflage\nscenarios, and next compute cluster properties in the Jordan frame that is\nbetter suited to these observations. Galaxy clusters are not screened by the\nK-mouflage mechanism and therefore feel the modification of gravity in a\nmaximal way. This implies that the halo mass function deviates from\n$\\Lambda$-CDM by a factor of order one for masses $M\\gtrsim 10^{14} \\ h^{-1}\nM_\\odot$. We then consider the hydrostatic equilibrium of gases embedded in\ngalaxy clusters and the consequences of K-mouflage on the X-ray cluster\nluminosity, the gas temperature, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. We find\nthat the cluster temperature function, and more generally number counts, are\nlargely affected by K-mouflage, mainly due to the increased cluster abundance\nin these models. Other scaling relations such as the mass-temperature and the\ntemperature-luminosity relations are only modified at the percent level due to\nthe constraints on K-mouflage from local Solar System tests.\n", "  In the previous papers (Kui\\'{c} et al. in Found Phys 42:319-339, 2012;\nKui\\'{c} in arXiv:1506.02622, 2015), it was demonstrated that applying the\nprinciple of maximum information entropy by maximizing the conditional\ninformation entropy, subject to the constraint given by the Liouville equation\naveraged over the phase space, leads to a definition of the rate of entropy\nchange for closed Hamiltonian systems without any additional assumptions. Here,\nwe generalize this basic model and, with the introduction of the additional\nconstraints which are equivalent to the hydrodynamic continuity equations, show\nthat the results obtained are consistent with the known results from the\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics of irreversible\nprocesses. In this way, as a part of the approach developed in this paper, the\nrate of entropy change and entropy production density for the classical\nHamiltonian fluid are obtained. The results obtained suggest the general\napplicability of the foundational principles of predictive statistical\nmechanics and their importance for the theory of irreversibility.\n", "  Let $A$ be subsystem of a larger system $A \\cup B$, and $\\psi$ be a typical\nstate from the subspace of the Hilbert space ${\\cal H}_{AB}$ satisfying an\nenergy constraint. Then $\\rho_A(\\psi)= {\\rm Tr}_B | \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi\n|$ is nearly thermal. We discuss how this observation is related to fast\nthermalization of the central region ($\\approx A$) in heavy ion collisions,\nwhere $B$ represents other degrees of freedom (soft modes, hard jets, collinear\nparticles) outside of $A$. Entanglement between the modes in $A$ and $B$ plays\na central role: the entanglement entropy $S_A$ increases rapidly in the\ncollision. In gauge-gravity duality, $S_A$ is related to the area of extremal\nsurfaces in the bulk, which can be studied using gravitational duals.\n", "  Symmetry-breaking has been known to play a key role in noncentrosymmetric\nsuperconductors with strong spin-orbit-interaction (SOI). The studies, however,\nhave been so far mainly focused on a particular type of SOI, known as Rashba\nSOI, whereby the electron spin is locked to its momentum at a right-angle,\nthereby leading to an in-planar helical spin texture. Here we discuss\nelectric-field-induced superconductivity in molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), which\nexhibits a fundamentally different type of intrinsic SOI manifested by an\nout-of-plane Zeeman-type spin polarization of energy valleys. We find an upper\ncritical field of approximately 52 T at 1.5 K, which indicates an enhancement\nof the Pauli limit by a factor of four as compared to that in centrosymmetric\nconventional superconductors. Using realistic tight-binding calculations, we\nreveal that this unusual behaviour is due to an inter-valley pairing that is\nsymmetrically protected by Zeeman-type spin-valley locking against external\nmagnetic fields. Our study sheds a new light on the interplay of inversion\nasymmetry with SOI in confined geometries, and its unprecedented role in\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We report on terahertz time-domain spectroscopy on superconducting and\nmetallic iron chalcogenides Rb$_{0.75}$Fe$_{1.6}$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$. The\nsuperconducting transition is reduced from $T_c=$ 32 K ($z=0$) to 22 K\n($z=1.0$), and finally suppressed ($z=1.4$) by isoelectronic substitution of Se\nwith S. Dielectric constant and optical conductivity exhibit a\nmetal-to-insulator transition associated with an orbital-selective Mott phase.\nThis orbital-selective Mott transition appears at higher temperature $T_{met}$\nwith increasing sulfur content, identifying sulfur substitution as an efficient\nparameter to tune orbital-dependent correlation effects in iron-chalcogenide\nsuperconductors. The reduced correlations of the $d_{xy}$ charge carriers can\naccount for the suppression of the superconductivity and the pseudogap-like\nfeature between $T_c$ and $T_{met}$ that was observed for $z=0$.\n", "  We present an approach of calculating the group of braided autoequivalences\nof the category of representations of the Drinfeld double of a finite\ndimensional Hopf algebra $H$ and thus the Brauer-Picard group of\n$H$-$\\mathrm{mod}$. We consider two natural subgroups and a subset as\ncandidates for generators. In this article $H$ is the group algebra of a finite\ngroup $G$. As our main result we prove that any element of the Brauer-Picard\ngroup, fulfilling an additional cohomological condition, decomposes into an\nordered product of our candidates. For elementary abelian groups $G$ our\ndecomposition reduces to the Bruhat decomposition of the Brauer-Picard group,\nwhich is in this case a Lie group over a finite field. Our results are\nmotivated by and have applications to symmetries and defects in $3d$-TQFT and\ngroup extensions of fusion categories.\n", "  Using the DIANA data on the charge-exchange reaction $K^+n \\rightarrow pK^0$\non a bound neutron, in which the s-channel formation of the pentaquark baryon\n$\\Theta^+(1538)$ has been observed, we analyze the dependence of the\nbackground-subtracted $\\Theta^+ \\rightarrow pK^0$ signal on the $K^0$ emission\nangle in the $pK^0$ rest frame. In order to describe the observed\n$\\cos\\Theta_K^\\mathrm{cms}$ distribution, invoking the interference between the\nnonresonant s-wave and the $\\Theta^+$-mediated higher-wave contributions to the\namplitude of the charge-exchange reaction is required at a 2.8$\\sigma$ level.\nThe spin--parity assignment of 1/2$^-$ for the $\\Theta^+$ baryon is ruled out\nat a statistical level of 2.9 standard deviations. A physically-meaningful\nselection in $\\cos\\Theta_K^\\mathrm{cms}$ based on the observed angular\ndependence of the $\\Theta^+ \\rightarrow pK^0$ signal allows to boost the\nstatistical significance of the signal up to 7.1 standard deviations. This is\nfar in excess of previously reported signals and renders the $\\Theta^+$\nexistence more credible.\n", "  We derive the neutrino flavor transition probabilities with the neutrino\ntreated as a wave packet. The decoherence and dispersion effects from the\nwave-packet treatment show up as damping and phase-shifting of the plane-wave\nneutrino oscillation patterns. If the energy uncertainty in the initial\nneutrino wave packet is larger than around 0.01 of the neutrino energy, the\ndecoherence and dispersion effects would degrade the sensitivity of reactor\nneutrino experiments to mass hierarchy measurement to lower than 3 $\\sigma$\nconfidence level.\n", "  We study two M5-branes on $A_{1}$ ALE space. We introduce some M2-branes\nsuspended between the M5-branes. Then, the boundaries of M2-branes look like\nstrings. We call them \"M-strings\". The M-strings have $\\mathcal{N}=(4,0)$\nsupersymmetry by considering the brane configuration on $A_{1}$ ALE space. We\ncalculate the partition function of M-strings by using the refined topological\nvertex formalism. We find that the supersymmetry of M-strings gets enhanced to\n$\\mathcal{N}=(4,4)$ by tuning some K\\\"ahler parameters. Furthermore, we discuss\nanother possibility of the enhancement of supersymmetry which is different from\nthe above one.\n", "  We discuss the inverse $\\beta$-decay of accelerated protons in the context of\nneutrino oscillations. The process $p\\rightarrow n \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell$ is\nkinematically allowed because the accelerating field provides the rest energy\ndifference between initial and final states. The rate of $p\\to n$ conversions\ncan be evaluated in either the laboratory frame (where the proton is\naccelerating) or the co-moving frame (where the proton is at rest and interacts\nwith an effective thermal bath of $\\ell$ and $\\nu_\\ell$ due to the Unruh\neffect). By explicit calculation, we show the rates in the two frames disagree\nwhen taking into account neutrino oscillations, because the weak interaction\ncouples to charge eigenstates whereas gravity couples to neutrino mass\neigenstates. The contradiction could be resolved experimentally, potentially\nyielding new information on the origins of neutrino masses.\n", "  The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool\nfor quantum many-body effects is explored. It is demonstrated that an array of\nelectrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the\nBose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon\nregime to the Anderson tight-binding model. Employing a density matrix\nformalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the\ninterplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization\nprocess. It is found that the phonon population remains localized for a long\ntime at low enough temperatures; with increasing temperatures the localization\nis rapidly lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing\nin the equilibrium a fully thermalized system. Finally, we consider a possible\nexperimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a\nsuperconducting transmon qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators. We also\nconsider the possibility of using the proposed quantum simulator for realizing\ncontinuous-time quantum walks.\n", "  We study light propagation in a neutral Weyl semimetal with the Fermi level\nlying at the Weyl nodes in the weak self-interacting regime. The nontrivial\ntopology induces a screening effect in one of the two transverse gauge fields,\nfor which we find two branches of attenuated collective excitations. In\naddition to the known topologically gaped photon mode, a novel massless and\nslightly damped excitation appears. Strikingly, at low energies this new\nexcitation has a linear dispersion and it propagates with the same velocity\nthan the electrons, while at energies well above the electron-hole continuum\nthreshold it behaves as a massive attenuated photon with velocity similar to\nthe speed of light in the material. There is a crossover at certain momentum in\nthe direction perpendicular to the separation of the Weyl nodes above which the\nnovel gapless mode enters into an overdamped regime. Regarding the unscreened\ngauge field we show that it is also attenuated, which is a non-topological\nproperty shared by Dirac semimetals as well.\n", "  The presence of losses in nonlinear photonic structures is a crucial issue\nfor modern applications. Active parts are introduced for wave power\ncompensation resulting in unbalanced gain and loss landscapes where localized\nbeam propagation is, in general, dynamically unstable. Here we provide generic\nsufficient conditions for the relation between the gain-loss and the refractive\nindex profiles in order to ensure efficient wave trapping and stable\npropagation for a wide range of beam launching conditions such as initial\npower, angle of incidence and position. The stability is a consequence of an\nunderlying dynamic power balance mechanism related to a conserved quantity of\nwave dynamics.\n", "  We present preliminary results on a novel numerical method describing wave\npropagation in non-uniform media. Following Huygens-Fresnel' principle, we\nmodel the wavefront as an array of point sources that emit wavelets, which\ninterfere. We then identify a set of new points where the electric field has\nequal phase. In fact, without losing generality, we find zeros of the electric\nfield, by means of the bisection method. This obviously corresponds to a\nspecific phase-advance, but is easily generalized, e.g. by phase-shifting all\nsources. The points found form the new wavefront. One of the advantages of the\nmethod is that it includes diffraction. Two examples provided are diffraction\naround an obstacle and the finite waist of a focused Gaussian beam. Refraction\nis also successfully modeled, both in slowly-varying media as well as in the\npresence of discontinuities. The calculations were performed in two dimensions,\nbut can be easily extended to three dimensions. We also discuss the extension\nto anisotropic, birefringent, absorbing media.\n", "  We present a model artificial multiferroic system consisting of a\n(011)-oriented ferroelectric Pb(Mg,Nb,Ti)O$_3$ substrate intimately coupled to\na ferromagnetic (La,Sr)MnO$_3$ film through epitaxial strain and converse\npiezoelectric effects. Electric field pulse sequences of less than 6 kV/cm were\nshown to induce large reversible and bistable remanent strains in the manganite\nfilm. Magnetic hysteresis loops demonstrate that the changes in strain states\nresult in significant changes in magnetic anisotropy from a highly anisotropic\ntwo-fold magnetic symmetry to a more isotropic one. Such changes in magnetic\nanisotropy are reversible upon multiple cycles and are stable at zero applied\nelectric field, and are accompanied by large changes in resistivity. We\ndirectly image the change between the two-fold and isotropic magnetic\nconfigurations at the scale of a single ferromagnetic domain using X-ray\nphotoemission electron microscopy as a function of applied electric field\npulses. Imaging the domain reversal process as a function of electric field\nshows that the energy barrier for magnetization reversal is drastically\nlowered, by up to 70% as determined from free energy calculations, through the\nanisotropic strain change generated by the ferroelectric substrate. Thus, an\nelectric field pulse can be used to 'set' and 'reset' the magnetic anisotropy\norientation and resistive state in the film, as well as lowering the coercive\nfield required to reverse magnetization, showing a promising route towards\nelectric-field manipulation of multifunctional nanostructures at room\ntemperature.\n", "  In this paper, based on the method of scalar perturbations, we construct the\n\\textit{anisotropic} charged Lifshitz background perturbatively upto leading\norder in the anisotropy. We perform our analysis both in the extremal as well\nas in the non extremal limit. Finally, we probe the so called superfluid phase\nof the boundary theory and explore the effects of anisotropy on the\nsuperconducting condensate.\n", "  Emergent Dirac fermion states underlie many intriguing properties of\ngraphene, and the search for them constitute one strong motivation to explore\ntwo-dimensional (2D) allotropes of other elements. Phosphorene, the ultrathin\nlayers of black phosphorous, has been a subject of intense investigations\nrecently, and it was found that other group-Va elements could also form 2D\nlayers with similar puckered lattice structure. Here, by a close examination of\ntheir electronic band structure evolution, we discover two types of Dirac\nfermion states emerging in the low-energy spectrum. One pair of (type-I) Dirac\npoints is sitting on high-symmetry lines, while two pairs of (type-II) Dirac\npoints are located at generic $k$-points, with different anisotropic\ndispersions determined by the reduced symmetries at their locations. Such\nfully-unpinned (type-II) 2D Dirac points are discovered for the first time. In\nthe absence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that each Dirac node is protected\nby the sublattice symmetry from gap opening, which is in turn ensured by any\none of three point group symmetries. The spin-orbit coupling generally gaps the\nDirac nodes, and for the type-I case, this drives the system into a quantum\nspin Hall insulator phase. We suggest possible ways to realize the unpinned\nDirac points in strained phosphorene.\n", "  Bilayer graphene hosts valley-chiral one dimensional modes at domain walls\nbetween regions of different interlayer potential or stacking order. When such\na channel is brought into proximity to a superconductor, the two electrons of a\nCooper pair which tunnel into it move in opposite directions because they\nbelong to different valleys related by the time-reversal symmetry. This is a\nkinetic variant of Cooper pair splitting, which requires neither Coulomb\nrepulsion nor energy filtering but is enforced by the robustness of the valley\nisospin in the absence of atomic-scale defects. We derive an effective model\nfor the guided modes in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, calculate the\nconductance carried by split and spin-entangled electron pairs, and interpret\nit as a result of local Andreev reflection processes, whereas crossed Andreev\nreflection is absent.\n", "  We investigate the imprint of reheating on the gravitational wave spectrum\nproduced by self-ordering of multi-component scalar fields after a global phase\ntransition. The equation of state of the Universe during reheating, which\nusually has different behaviour from that of a radiation-dominated Universe,\naffects the evolution of gravitational waves through the Hubble expansion term\nin the equations of motion. This gives rise to a different power-law behavior\nof frequency in the gravitational wave spectrum. The reheating history is\ntherefore imprinted in the shape of the spectrum. We perform $512^3$ lattice\nsimulations to investigate how the ordering scalar field reacts to the change\nof the Hubble expansion and how the reheating effect arises in the spectrum. We\nalso compare the result with inflation-produced gravitational waves, which has\na similar spectral shape, and discuss whether it is possible to distinguish the\norigin between inflation and global phase transition by detecting the shape\nwith future direct detection gravitational wave experiments such as DECIGO.\n", "  We put forward a hydrodynamic theory of nematic liquid crystals that includes\nboth anisotropic elasticity and dynamic relaxation. Liquid remodeling is\nencompassed through a continuous update of the shear-stress free configuration.\nThe low-frequency limit of the dynamical theory reproduces the classical\nEricksen-Leslie theory, but it predicts two independent identities between the\nsix Leslie viscosity coefficients. One replicates Parodi's relation, while the\nother-which involves five Leslie viscosities in a nonlinear way-is new. We\ndiscuss its significance, and we test its validity against evidence from\nphysical experiments, independent theoretical predictions, and\nmolecular-dynamics simulations.\n", "  We present a method to transform multivariate unimodal non-Gaussian posterior\nprobability densities into approximately Gaussian ones via non-linear mappings,\nsuch as Box--Cox transformations and generalisations thereof. This permits an\nanalytical reconstruction of the posterior from a point sample, like a Markov\nchain, and simplifies the subsequent joint analysis with other experiments.\nThis way, a multivariate posterior density can be reported efficiently, by\ncompressing the information contained in MCMC samples. Further, the model\nevidence integral (i.e. the marginal likelihood) can be computed analytically.\nThis method is analogous to the search for normal parameters in the cosmic\nmicrowave background, but is more general. The search for the optimally\nGaussianising transformation is performed computationally through a\nmaximum-likelihood formalism; its quality can be judged by how well the\ncredible regions of the posterior are reproduced. We demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms kernel density estimates in this objective. Further, we\nselect marginal posterior samples from Planck data with several distinct\nstrongly non-Gaussian features, and verify the reproduction of the marginal\ncontours. To demonstrate evidence computation, we Gaussianise the joint\ndistribution of data from weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO),\nfor different cosmological models, and find a preference for flat $\\Lambda$CDM.\nComparing to values computed with the Savage-Dickey density ratio, and\nPopulation Monte Carlo, we find good agreement of our method within the spread\nof the other two.\n", "  Two-phase turbulent Taylor-Couette (TC) flow is simulated using an\nEuler-Lagrange approach to study the effects of a secondary phase dispersed\ninto a turbulent carrier phase (here bubbles dispersed into water). The\ndynamics of the carrier phase is computed using Direct Numerical Simulations\n(DNS) in an Eulerian framework, while the bubbles are tracked in a Lagrangian\nmanner by modelling the effective drag, lift, added mass and buoyancy force\nacting on them. Two-way coupling is implemented between the dispersed phase and\nthe carrier phase which allows for momentum exchange among both phases and to\nstudy the effect of the dispersed phase on the carrier phase dynamics. The\nradius ratio of the TC setup is fixed to $\\eta=0.833$, and a maximum inner\ncylinder Reynolds number of $Re_i=8000$ is reached. We vary the Froude number\n($Fr$), which is the ratio of the centripetal to the gravitational acceleration\nof the dispersed phase and study its effect on the net torque required to drive\nthe TC system. For the two-phase TC system, we observe drag reduction, i.e.,\nthe torque required to drive the inner cylinder is less compared to that of the\nsingle phase system. The net drag reduction decreases with increasing Reynolds\nnumber $Re_i$, which is consistent with previous experimental findings (Murai\net al. 2005, 2008). The drag reduction is strongly related to the Froude\nnumber: for fixed Reynolds number we observe higher drag reduction when $Fr <\n1$ than for with$ Fr > 1$. This buoyancy effect is more prominent in low $Re_i$\nsystems and decreases with increasing Reynolds number $Re_i$. We trace the drag\nreduction back to the weakening of the angular momentum carrying Taylor rolls\nby the rising bubbles.\n", "  In this paper, we consider an inflationary model of $f(R)$ gravity with\npolynomial form plus logarithmic term. We calculate some cosmological\nparameters and compare our results with the Plank 2015 data. We find that\npresence of both logarithmic and polynomial corrections are necessary to yield\nslow-roll condition. Also, we study critical points and stability of the model\nto find that it is a viable model.\n", "  Two-dimensional ensembles of bent-core shaped molecules attain at highly\norienting surfaces liquid crystalline structures characteristic mostly for\nlamellar chiral or nonchiral antiferroelectric order. Here, using the\nOnsager-type of density functional theory supplemented by constant-pressure\nMonte-Carlo (MC) simulation we investigate the role of excluded-volume\ninteractions in stabilizing different structures in monolayers filled with\nbent-shaped molecules. We study influence of molecular features, like the apex\nangle, thickness of the arm and the type of the arm edges on the stability of\nlayered structures. For simple molecular shapes taken the observed phases are\ndominated by the lamellar antiferroelectric type as observed experimentally,\nbut a considerable sensitivity of the ordering to details of the molecular\nshape is found for order parameters and wave vectors of the structures.\nInterestingly, for large opening angles and not too thick molecules a window of\nstable nematic splay-bend phase is shown to exist. The presented theory models\nequilibrium properties of bent-core liquid crystals subjected to strong planar\nanchoring, in the case when details of the surface are of secondary importance.\n", "  Searching the novel 2D semiconductor is crucial to develop the\nnext-generation low-dimensional electronic device. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we propose a class of unexplored binary V-V compound\nsemiconductor (PN, AsN, SbN, AsP, SbP and SbAs) with monolayer black\nphosphorene ($\\alpha$) and blue phosphorene ($\\beta$) structure. Our phonon\nspectra and room-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) calculations indicate that\nall compounds are very stable. Moreover, most of compounds are found to present\na moderate energy gap in the visible frequency range, which can be tuned\ngradually by in-plane strain. Especially, $\\alpha$-phase V-V compounds have a\ndirect gap while $\\beta$-SbN, AsN, SbP, and SbAs may be promising candidates of\n2D solar cell materials due to a wide gap separating acoustic and optical\nphonon modes. Furthermore, vertical heterostructures can be also built using\nlattice matched $\\alpha$($\\beta$)-SbN and phosphorene, and both vdW\nheterostructures are found to have intriguing direct band gap. The present\ninvestigation not only broads the scope of layered group V semiconductors but\nalso provides an unprecedented route for the potential applications of 2D V-V\nfamilies in optoelectronic and nanoelectronic semiconductor devices.\n", "  We calculate the production rate of singlet fermions from the decay of\nneutral or charged scalar fields in a hot plasma. We find that there are\nconsiderable thermal corrections when the temperature of the plasma exceeds the\nmass of the decaying scalar. We give analytic expressions for the\ntemperature-corrected production rates in the regime where the decay products\nare relativistic. We also study the regime of non-relativistic decay products\nnumerically. Our results can be used to determine the abundance and momentum\ndistribution of Dark Matter particles produced in scalar decays. The inclusion\nof thermal corrections helps to improve predictions for the free streaming of\nthe Dark Matter particles, which is crucial to test the compatibility of a\ngiven model with cosmic structure formation. With some modifications, our\nresults may be generalised to the production of other Dark Matter candidates in\nscalar decays.\n", "  We present a design for the experimental integration of ion trapping and\nsuperconducting qubit systems as a step towards the realization of a quantum\nhybrid system. The scheme addresses two key difficulties in realizing such a\nsystem; a combined microfabricated ion trap and superconducting qubit\narchitecture, and the experimental infrastructure to facilitate both\ntechnologies. Developing upon work by Kielpinski et al. [1] we describe the\ndesign, simulation and fabrication process for a microfabricated ion trap\ncapable of coupling an ion to a superconducting microwave LC circuit with a\ncoupling strength in the tens of kHz. We also describe existing difficulties in\ncombining the experimental infrastructure of an ion trapping setup into a\ndilution fridge with superconducting qubits and present solutions that can be\nimmediately implemented using current technology.\n", "  Weak value (WV) protocols may lead to extreme expectation values that are\nlarger than the corresponding orthodox expectation values. Recent works have\nproposed to implement this concept in nano-scale electronic systems. Here we\naddress the issue of how one calibrates the setup in question, maximizes the\nmeasurement's sensitivity, and extracts distinctly large WVs. Our concrete\nsetup consists of two Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs): the \"system\" and the\n\"detector\". Such setups have already been implemented in experiment.\n", "  We introduce a first full analytical bubble and blow-out model for a radially\ninhomogeneous plasma in a quasi-static approximation. For both cases we\ncalculate the accelerating and the focusing fields. In our model we also assume\na thin electron layer that surrounds the wake field and calculate the field\nconfiguration within. Our theory holds for arbitrary radial density profiles\nand reduces to known models in the limit of a homogeneous plasma. From a\nprevious study of hollow plasma channels with smooth boundaries for\nlaser-driven electron acceleration in the bubble regime we know that\npancake-like laser pulses lead to highest electron energies [Pukhov et al, PRL\n113, 245003 (2014)]. As it was shown, the bubble fields can be adjusted to\nbalance the laser depletion and dephasing lengths by varying the plasma density\nprofile inside a deep channel. Now we show why the radial fields in the vacuum\npart of a channel become defocussing.\n", "  We provide a self-contained review of master equation approaches to modelling\nphonon effects in optically driven self-assembled quantum dots. Coupling of the\n(quasi) two-level excitonic system to phonons leads to dissipation and\ndephasing, the rates of which depend on the excitation conditions, intrinsic\nproperties of the QD sample, and its temperature. We describe several\ntechniques, which include weak-coupling master equations that are perturbative\nin the exciton-phonon coupling, as well as those based on the polaron\ntransformation that can remain valid for strong phonon interactions. We\nadditionally consider the role of phonons in altering the optical emission\ncharacteristics of quantum dot devices, outlining how we must modify standard\nquantum optics treatments to account for the presence of the solid-state\nenvironment.\n", "  We examine the performance of our recently developed LFAs-PBE\nexchange-correlation (XC) potential [C.-R. Pan, P.-T. Fang, and J.-D. Chai,\nPhys. Rev. A, 2013, 87, 052510] for the high-order harmonic generation (HHG)\nspectra and related properties of H2+ molecules aligned parallel and\nperpendicular to the polarization of an intense linearly polarized laser pulse,\nemploying the real-time formulation of time-dependent density functional theory\n(RT-TDDFT). The results are compared with the exact solutions of the\ntime-dependent Schrodinger equation as well as those obtained with other XC\npotentials in RT-TDDFT. Owing to its correct (-1/r) asymptote, the LFAs-PBE\npotential significantly outperforms conventional XC potentials for the HHG\nspectra and the properties that are sensitive to the XC potential asymptote.\nAccordingly, the LFAs-PBE potential, which has a computational cost similar to\nthat of the popular Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) potential, can be very\npromising for the study of the ground-state, excited-state, and time-dependent\nproperties of large electronic systems, extending the applicability of density\nfunctional methods for a diverse range of applications.\n", "  Hadronic deuteron polarizability correction to the Lamb shift of muonic\ndeuterium is calculated on the basis of unitary isobar model and modern\nexperimental data on the structure functions of deep inelastic lepton-deuteron\nscattering and their parameterizations in the resonance and nonresonance\nregions.\n", "  A new approach in solution of simple quantum mechanical problems in deformed\nspace with minimal length is presented. We propose the generalization of\nSchro\\\"edinger equation in momentum representation on the case of deformed\nHeisenberg algebra with minimal length. Assuming that the kernel of potential\nenergy operator do not change in the case of deformation, we obtain exact\nsolution of eigenproblem of a particle in delta potential as well as double\ndelta potential. Particle in Coulomb like potential is revisited and the\nproblem of inversibility and hermicity of inverse coordinate operator is\nsolved.\n", "  We provide a detailed study of prompt double $J/\\psi$ production within the\nnon-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.\nWe confront the recent LHC data with the results obtained at leading-order (LO)\nin the NRQCD framework within two approaches of the collinear factorization and\nthe $k_T$-factorization. We show that the LHCb data are consistent with the\n$k_T$-factorized LO NRQCD results. We show that the full LO NRQCD formalism\ncannot describe the recent CMS data, with about one order of magnitude\ndiscrepancy. If the CMS data are confirmed, this indicates rather large\nhigher-order corrections for prompt double $J/\\psi$ production. We provide\nvarious predictions which can further test the NRQCD-based approach at the LHC\nin a kinematic region that LO contributions dominate. We also investigate\nlong-range in rapidity double $J/\\psi$ correlations. We found no evidence of a\nridge-like structure for double $J/\\psi$ production in proton-proton collisions\nat the LHC up to subleading $\\alpha_s^6$ accuracy.\n", "  We study three instances of log-correlated processes on the interval: the\nlogarithm of the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) characteristic polynomial, the\nGaussian log-correlated potential in presence of edge charges, and the\nFractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H \\to 0$ (fBM0). In previous\ncollaborations we obtained the probability distribution function (PDF) of the\nvalue of the global minimum (equivalently maximum) for the first two processes,\nusing the {\\it freezing-duality conjecture} (FDC). Here we study the PDF of the\nposition of the maximum $x_m$ through its moments. Using replica, this requires\ncalculating moments of the density of eigenvalues in the $\\beta$-Jacobi\nensemble. Using Jack polynomials we obtain an exact and explicit expression for\nboth positive and negative integer moments for arbitrary $\\beta >0$ and\npositive integer $n$ in terms of sums over partitions. For positive moments,\nthis expression agrees with a very recent independent derivation by Mezzadri\nand Reynolds. We check our results against a contour integral formula derived\nrecently by Borodin and Gorin (presented in the Appendix A from these authors).\nThe duality necessary for the FDC to work is proved, and on our expressions,\nfound to correspond to exchange of partitions with their dual. Performing the\nlimit $n \\to 0$ and to negative Dyson index $\\beta \\to -2$, we obtain the\nmoments of $x_m$ and give explicit expressions for the lowest ones. Numerical\nchecks for the GUE polynomials, performed independently by N. Simm, indicate\nencouraging agreement. Some results are also obtained for moments in Laguerre,\nHermite-Gaussian, as well as circular and related ensembles. The correlations\nof the position and the value of the field at the minimum are also analyzed.\n", "  Quantum process tomography, the standard procedure to characterize any\nquantum channel in nature, is affected by a circular argument: in order to\ncharacterize the channel, the tomographic preparation and measurement need in\nturn to be already characterized. We break this loop by designing an\noperational framework able to optimally characterize any given unknown quantum\nchannel in a device-independent fashion, namely, by only looking at its\ninput-output statistics, under the sole assumption that quantum theory is\nvalid. We provide explicit solutions, in closed form, for practically relevant\ncases such as the erasure, depolarizing, and amplitude-damping channels.\n", "  We implement and optimize a particle-swap Monte-Carlo algorithm that allows\nus to thermalize a polydisperse system of hard spheres up to\nunprecedentedly-large volume fractions, where \\revise{previous} algorithms and\nexperiments fail to equilibrate. We show that no glass singularity intervenes\nbefore the jamming density, which we independently determine through two\ndistinct non-equilibrium protocols. We demonstrate that equilibrium fluid and\nnon-equilibrium jammed states can have the same density, showing that the\njamming transition cannot be the end-point of the fluid branch.\n", "  In this paper we present multidimensional analogues of both the continuous-\nand discrete-time Toda lattices. The integrable systems that we consider here\nhave two or more space coordinates. To construct the systems, we generalize the\northogonal polynomial approach for the continuous and discrete Toda lattices to\nthe case of multiple orthogonal polynomials.\n", "  In this paper we study under which conditions the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti\nde Sitter black hole can be a solution of the vacuum mimetic $F(R)$ gravity\nwith Lagrange multiplier and mimetic scalar potential. As we demonstrate, the\nresulting picture in the mimetic $F(R)$ gravity case, is different in\ncomparison to the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case, with the two descriptions\nresulting to a different set of constraints that need to hold true. We also\ninvestigate the metric perturbations in the mimetic $F(R)$ gravity case, for\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti de Sitter black hole metric, at first order of\nthe perturbed variables. Interestingly enough, the resulting equations are\nidentical to the ones corresponding to the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti de Sitter black hole, at least at first order. We\nattribute this feature to the particular form of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-anti\nde Sitter metric, and we speculate for which cases there could be differences\nbetween the mimetic and non-mimetic case. Since the perturbation equations are\nthe same for the two cases, it is possible to have black hole instabilities in\nthe mimetic $F(R)$ gravity case too, which can be interpreted as\nanti-evaporation of the black hole.\n", "  We provide the full asymptotic description of the quasi-normal modes\n(resonances) in any strip of fixed width for Dirac fields in slowly rotating\nKerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes. The resonances split in a way similar to the\nZeeman effect. The method is based on the extension to Dirac operators of\ntechniques applied by Dyatlov 2011, 2012 to the (uncharged) Kerr-de Sitter\nblack holes. We show that the mass of the Dirac field does not have effect on\nthe two leading terms in the expansions of resonances.\n", "  To separate scintillation and Cherenkov lights in water-based liquid\nscintillator detectors is a desired feature for future neutrino and proton\ndecay researches. Linear alkyl benzene (LAB) is one important ingredient of a\nwater-based liquid scintillator being developed. In this paper we observed a\ngood separation of scintillation and Cherenkov lights in an LAB sample. The\nrising and decay times of the scintillation light of the LAB were measured to\nbe $(7.7\\pm3.0)\\ \\rm{ns}$ and $(36.6\\pm2.4)\\ \\rm{ns}$, respectively, while the\nfull width [-3$\\sigma$, 3$\\sigma$] of the Cherenkov light was 12 ns dominated\nby the time resolution of our photomultiplier tubes. The light yield of the\nscintillation was measured to be $(1.01\\pm0.12)\\times10^3\\\n\\rm{photons}/\\rm{MeV}$.\n", "  Here, we present the application of a novel method for controlling the\ngeometry of a state-dependent honeycomb lattice: The energy offset between the\ntwo sublattices of the honeycomb structure can be adjusted by rotating the\natomic quantization axis. This enables us to continuously tune between a\nhomogeneous graphene-like honeycomb lattice and a triangular lattice and to\nopen an energy gap at the characteristic Dirac points. We probe the symmetry of\nthe lattice with microwave spectroscopy techniques and investigate the behavior\nof atoms excited to the second energy band. We find a striking influence of the\nenergy gap at the Dirac cones onto the lifetimes of atoms in the excited band.\n", "  The dynamics of flame propagation in systems with infinite Lewis number and\nspatially discretized sources of heat release is examined, which is applicable\nto the combustion of suspensions of fuel particles in air. The system is\nanalyzed numerically using a one-dimensional heat equation with a source term\nfor the reaction progress variable, which is specified to have zero\ndiffusivity, and the model reveals a spectrum of flame-propagation regimes. For\nthe case of a switch-type reaction rate and homogeneous media (continuous\nregime), the flame propagates steadily at a velocity in agreement with\nanalytical solutions. As the sources are spatially concentrated into\n{\\delta}-function-like sources, propagation approaches the discrete regime with\na fixed period between ignition of the sources, for which an analytic solution\nis also available for validation. When the source term is governed by an\nArrhenius rate and the activation energy is increased beyond the stability\nboundary, the flame begins to exhibit a long-wavelength (4-5 times the thermal\nflame thickness) oscillation characteristic of the thermo-diffusive\ninstability, in good agreement with prior stability analysis. When spatial\ndiscreteness is introduced, a competition is observed between the long-period\noscillations of the thermo-diffusive instability and the pulsations associated\nwith the rapid heat release of the concentrated sources. Interestingly, the\npresence of spatial discreteness is able to excite higher modes (period\ndoubling and chaotic solutions) of the thermo-diffusive instability, suggesting\nthat the introduction of discreteness may have an influence qualitatively\nsimilar to that of increasing activation energy. Relevance of the model\nparameters to experimental systems is then discussed.\n", "  We show that fermionic dipoles in a two-layer geometry form Cooper pairs with\nboth singlet and triplet components, when they are tilted with respect to the\nnormal of the planes. The mixed parity pairing arises because the interaction\nbetween dipoles in the two different layers is not inversion symmetric. We use\nan efficient eigenvalue approach to calculate the zero temperature phase\ndiagram of the system as a function of the dipole orientation and the layer\ndistance. The phase diagram contains purely triplet as well as mixed singlet\nand triplet superfluid phases. We show in detail how the pair wave function for\ndipoles residing in different layers smoothly changes from singlet to triplet\nsymmetry as the orientation of the dipoles is changed. Our results indicate\nthat dipolar quantum gases can be used to unambiguously observe mixed parity\npairing.\n", "  The self-assembly of highly anisotropic colloidal particles leads to a rich\nvariety of morphologies, whose properties are just beginning to be understood.\nThis article uses computer simulations to probe a particle-scale perturbation\nof a commonly studied colloidal assembly, a monolayer membrane composed of\nrodlike fd viruses in the presence of a polymer depletant. Motivated by\nexperiments currently in progress, we simulate the interaction between a\nmicrotubule and a monolayer membrane as the microtubule \"pokes\" and penetrates\nthe membrane face-on. Both the viruses and the microtubule are modeled as hard\nspherocylinders of the same diameter, while the depletant is modeled using\nghost spheres. We find that the force exerted on the microtubule by the\nmembrane is zero either when the microtubule is completely outside the membrane\nor when it has fully penetrated the membrane. The microtubule is initially\nrepelled by the membrane as it begins to penetrate but experiences an\nattractive force as it penetrates further. We assess the roles played by\ntranslational and rotational fluctuations of the viruses and the osmotic\npressure of the polymer depletant. We find that rotational fluctuations play a\nmore important role than the translational ones. The dependence on the osmotic\npressure of the depletant of the width and height of the repulsive barrier and\nthe depth of the attractive potential well is consistent with the assumed\ndepletion-induced attractive interaction between the microtubule and viruses.\nWe discuss the relevance of these studies to the experimental investigations.\n\\end{abstract}\n", "  We propose a new approach to explore CPT violation of neutrino oscillation\nthrough a fluctuating matter based on time-dependent geometric quantities. By\nmapping the neutrino oscillation onto a Poincare sphere structure, we obtain an\nanalytic solution of master equation and further define the geometric\nquantities, i.e., radius of Poincare sphere and geometric phase. We find that\nthe mixing process between electron and muon neutrinos can be described by the\nradius of Poincare sphere that depends on the intrinsic CP-violating angle.\nSuch a radius reveals a dynamic mechanism of CPT-violation, i.e., both\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and Majorana-Dirac neutrino confusion. We show\nthat the time-dependent geometric phase can be used to find the neutrino nature\nand observe the CPT-violation because it is strongly enhanced under the\nneutrino propagation. We further show that the time-dependent geometric phase\ncan be easily detected by simulating the neutrino oscillation based on\nfluctuating magnetic fields in nuclear magnetic resonance, which makes the\nexperimental observation of CPT-violation possible in the neutrino mixing and\noscillation.\n", "  The production of $D^{*\\pm}$, $D^\\pm$ and $D_s^\\pm$ charmed mesons has been\nmeasured with the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the\nLHC, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $280\\,$nb$^{-1}$.\nThe charmed mesons have been reconstructed in the range of transverse momentum\n$3.5<p_{\\rm T}(D)<100$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\\eta(D)|<2.1$. The differential\ncross sections as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity were\nmeasured for $D^{*\\pm}$ and $D^\\pm$ production. The next-to-leading-order QCD\npredictions are consistent with the data in the visible kinematic region within\nthe large theoretical uncertainties. Using the visible $D$ cross sections and\nan extrapolation to the full kinematic phase space, the strangeness-suppression\nfactor in charm fragmentation, the fraction of charged non-strange $D$ mesons\nproduced in a vector state, and the total cross section of charm production at\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV were derived.\n", "  We propose a closed formula of the universal part of supersymmetric R\\'enyi\nentropy $S_q$ for $(2,0)$ superconformal theories in six-dimensions. We show\nthat $S_q$ across a spherical entangling surface is a cubic polynomial of\n$\\gamma:=1/q$, with all coefficients expressed in terms of the newly discovered\nWeyl anomalies $a$ and $c$. This is equivalent to a similar statement of the\nsupersymmetric free energy on conic (or squashed) six-sphere. We first obtain\nthe closed formula by promoting the free tensor multiplet result and then\nprovide an independent derivation by assuming that $S_q$ can be written as a\nlinear combination of 't Hooft anomaly coefficients. We discuss a possible\nlower bound ${a\\over c}\\geq {3\\over 7}$ implied by our result.\n", "  Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems,\nparticularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient\ncircuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the\nderivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely\nripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the\nbinary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to\nhigher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set.\nOur ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only\n$1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than\nprevious constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth\nof only $O(\\log\\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on\ntwo levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic\ncircuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of\nnon-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections\nfurther by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the\nnon-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\\rangle \\mapsto |i, j + \\delta_{i,2} \\mod\n3\\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate\n$P_9=\\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \\pi \\, i/9},1,e^{2 \\pi \\, i/9})$. The two choices of\nelementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different\nprospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and\nthe supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to\nfactor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary\nfinite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be\nimplemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis.\n", "  Deriving the Einstein field equations (EFE) with matter fluid from the action\nprinciple is not straightforward, because mass conservation must be added as an\nadditional constraint to make rest-frame mass density variable in reaction to\nmetric variation. This can be avoided by introducing a constraint\n$\\delta(\\sqrt{-g}) = 0$ to metric variations $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$, and then the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ emerges as an integration constant. This is a\nremoval of one of the four constraints on initial conditions forced by EFE at\nthe birth of the universe, and it may imply that EFE are unnecessarily\nrestrictive about initial conditions. I then adopt a principle that the theory\nof gravity should be able to solve time evolution starting from arbitrary\ninhomogeneous initial conditions about spacetime and matter. The equations of\ngravitational fields satisfying this principle are obtained, by setting four\nauxiliary constraints on $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$ to extract six degrees of freedom\nfor gravity. The cost of achieving this is a loss of general covariance, but\nthese equations constitute a consistent theory if they hold in the special\ncoordinate systems that can be uniquely specified with respect to the initial\nspace-like hypersurface when the universe was born. This theory predicts that\ngravity is described by EFE with non-zero $\\Lambda$ in a homogeneous patch of\nthe universe created by inflation, but $\\Lambda$ changes continuously across\ndifferent patches. Then both the smallness and coincidence problems of the\ncosmological constant are solved by the anthropic argument. This is just a\nresult of inhomogeneous initial conditions, not requiring any change of the\nfundamental physical laws in different patches.\n", "  In this paper we explore $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$, where $T$ and $\\mathcal{T}$\ndenote the torsion scalar and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor\nrespectively. We impose the covariant conservation to the energy-momentum\ntensor and obtain a cosmological $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$ respectively. We impose\nthe covariant conservation to the energy-momentum tensor and obtain a\ncosmological $f(T, \\mathcal{T})$ model. Then, we study the stability of the\nobtained model for power-law and de Sitter solutions and our result show that\nthe model can be stable for some values of the input parameters, for both\npower-law and de Sitter solutions.\n", "  We present the first simulations within an effective theory of structure\nformation (ETHOS), which includes the effect of interactions between dark\nmatter and dark radiation on the linear initial power spectrum and dark matter\nself-interactions during non-linear structure formation. We simulate a Milky\nWay-like halo in four different dark matter models and the cold dark matter\ncase. Our highest resolution simulation has a particle mass of $2.8\\times\n10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and a softening length of $72.4\\,{\\rm pc}$. We demonstrate\nthat all alternative models have only a negligible impact on large scale\nstructure formation. On galactic scales, however, the models significantly\naffect the structure and abundance of subhaloes due to the combined effects of\nsmall scale primordial damping in the power spectrum and late time\nself-interactions. We derive an analytic mapping from the primordial damping\nscale in the power spectrum to the cutoff scale in the halo mass function and\nthe kinetic decoupling temperature. We demonstrate that certain models within\nthis extended effective framework that can alleviate the too-big-to-fail and\nmissing satellite problems simultaneously, and possibly the core-cusp problem.\nThe primordial power spectrum cutoff of our models naturally creates a\ndiversity in the circular velocity profiles, which is larger than that found\nfor cold dark matter simulations. We show that the parameter space of models\ncan be constrained by contrasting model predictions to astrophysical\nobservations. For example, some models may be challenged by the missing\nsatellite problem if baryonic processes were to be included and even over-solve\nthe too-big-to-fail problem; thus ruling them out.\n", "  We show that the magnetic component of the photon field produced by dark\nmatter axions via the two-photon coupling mechanism in a Sikivie Haloscope is\nan important parameter passed over in previous analysis and experiments. The\ninteraction of the produced photons will be resonantly enhanced as long as they\ncouple to the electric or magnetic mode structure of the Haloscope cavity. For\ntypical Haloscope experiments the electric and magnetic coupling is the same\nand implicitly assumed in past sensitivity calculations. However, for future\nplanned searches such as those at high frequency, which synchronize multiple\ncavities, the sensitivity will be altered due to different magnetic and\nelectric couplings. We define the complete electromagnetic form factor and\ndiscuss its implications for current and future high and low mass axion\nsearches, including some effects which have been overlooked, due to the\nassumption that the two couplings are the same.\n", "  The pseudorapidity density of charged particles\n($\\mathrm{d}N_\\mathrm{ch}/\\mathrm{d}\\eta$) at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions\nhas been measured at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. It increases with centrality and reaches a value of $1943 \\pm\n54$ in $|\\eta|<0.5$ for the 5% most central collisions. A rise in\n$\\mathrm{d}N_\\mathrm{ch}/\\mathrm{d}\\eta$ as a function of $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$\nfor the most central collisions is observed, steeper than that observed in\nproton-proton collisions and following the trend established by measurements at\nlower energy. The centrality dependence of\n$\\mathrm{d}N_\\mathrm{ch}/\\mathrm{d}\\eta$ as a function of the average number of\nparticipant nucleons, ${\\langle N_\\mathrm{part} \\rangle}$, calculated in a\nGlauber model, is compared with the previous measurement at lower energy. A\nconstant factor of about 1.2 describes the increase in $\\frac{2}{\\langle\nN_\\mathrm{part} \\rangle}\\langle \\mathrm{d}N_\\mathrm{ch}/\\mathrm{d}\\eta \\rangle$\nfrom $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV for all\ncentrality intervals, within the measured range of 0-80% centrality. The\nresults are also compared to models based on different mechanisms for particle\nproduction in nuclear collisions.\n", "  There has been considerable recent interest in the mean-field dynamics of\nvarious atom-interferometry schemes designed for precision sensing. In the\nfield of quantum metrology, the standard tools for evaluating metrological\nsensitivity are the classical- and quantum-Fisher information. In this letter,\nwe show how these tools can be adapted to evaluate the sensitivity when the\nbehaviour is dominated by mean-field dynamics. As an example, we compare the\nbehaviour of four recent theoretical proposals for gyroscopes based on\nmatterwaves interference in toroidally trapped geometries. We show that while\nthe quantum Fisher information increases at different rates for the various\nschemes considered, in all cases it is consistent with the well-known Sagnac\nphase shift after the matterwaves have traversed a closed path. However, we\nargue that the relevant metric for quantifying interferometric sensitivity is\nthe classical Fisher information, which can vary considerably between the\nschemes.\n", "  We study the dynamics of quantum bosonic waves confined in a one-dimensional\ntilted optical lattice. The bosons are under the action of an effective\nspatially localized nonlinear two-body potential barrier set in the central\npart of the lattice. This version of the Bose-Hubbard model can be realized in\natomic Bose-Einstein condensates, by means of localized Feshbach resonance, and\nin quantum optics, using an arrayed waveguide with selectively doped guiding\ncores. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the central barrier induces\nanomalous quantum reflection of incident wave packets acting solely on bosonic\ncomponents with multiple onsite occupancies. From the other side\nsingle-occupancy components can pass the barrier thus allowing one to distill\nthem in the central interacting zone. As a consequence, in this region one\nfinds a state in which the multiple occupancy is forbidden, i.e., a\nTonks-Girardeau gas. Our results demonstrate that this regime can be obtained\ndynamically, using relatively weak interactions, irrespective of their sign.\n", "  Motivated by what is possibly the first sign of new physics seen at the LHC,\nthe diphoton excess at $750$ GeV in ATLAS and CMS, we present a model that\nprovides naturally the necessary ingredients to explain the resonance. The\nsimplest phenomenological explanation for the diphoton excess requires a new\nscalar state, $X(750)$, as well as additional vector-like (VL) fermions\nintroduced in an ad-hoc way in order to enhance its decays into a pair of\nphotons and/or increase its production cross-section. We show that the\nrequiered VL quarks and their couplings can emerge naturally from a complete\nframework based on the $SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_\\mathcal{X}$ gauge symmetry.\n", "  In the present work, we are interested in the properties of nuclear matter at\nzero temperature in the presence of strong magnetic fields using the lowest\norder constraint variational (LOCV) method employing $AV_{18}$ nuclear\npotential. Our results indicate that in the absence of a magnetic field, the\nenergy per particle is a symmetric function of the spin polarization parameter.\nThis shows that for the nuclear matter, the spontaneous phase transition to a\nferromagnetic state does not occur. However, we have found that for the\nmagnetic fields $ B\\gtrsim 10 ^ {18}\\ G$, the symmetry of energy is broken and\nthe energy has a minimum at a positive value of the spin polarization\nparameter. We have also found that the effect of magnetic field on the value of\nenergy is more significant at the low densities. Our calculations show that at\nlower densities, the spin polarization parameter is more sensitive to the\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The Noether theorem connecting symmetries and conservation laws can be\napplied directly in a Hamiltonian framework without using any intermediate\nLagrangian formulation. This requires a careful discussion about the invariance\nof the boundary conditions under a canonical transformation and this paper\nproposes to address this issue. Then, the unified treatment of Hamiltonian\nsystems offered by Noether's approach is illustrated on several examples,\nincluding classical field theory and quantum dynamics.\n", "  The Kaluza-Klein excitations of gluons offer the exciting possibility of\nprobing bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) models. In these bulk models either a\ncustodial symmetry or a deformation of the metric away from AdS is invoked in\norder to deal with electroweak precision tests. Addressing both these models,\nwe suggest a new channel in which to study the production of KK-gluons\n($g_{KK}$): one where it is produced in association with one or more hard jets.\nThe cross-section for the $g_{KK}+$ jets channel is significant because of\nseveral contributing sub-processes. In particular, the 1-jet and the 2-jet\nassociated processes are important because at these orders in QCD the $qg$ and\nthe $gg$ initial states respectively come into play. We have performed a\nhadron-level simulation of the signal and present strategies to effectively\nextract the signal from what could potentially be a huge background. We present\nresults for the kinematic reach of the LHC Run-II for different $g_{KK}$ masses\nin bulk-RS models.\n", "  Quenching, the cessation of star formation, is one of the most significant\nevents in the life cycle of galaxies. We show here the first evidence that the\nMilky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end\nof its thick disk formation $\\sim$9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars\nstudied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than $\\sim$2\nGyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude.\nBecause of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event\nreflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the\n[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the\nMilky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at\na much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by\nthe latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type\ngalaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion\nof gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the\nchemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not\ndue to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with\nspheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way,\npossibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin\ndisks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in\nwhich classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true\ngenerally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately $M^*$, where\nquenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize\nthat the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and\nrelated to, the formation of the bar. We sketch a scenario on how a strong bar\nmay inhibit star formation.\n", "  We show how the two physically-distinct sources of CP-asymmetry relevant to\nscenarios of leptogenesis: (i) resonant mixing and (ii) oscillations between\ndifferent flavours can be unambiguously identified within the Kadanoff-Baym\nformalism. These contributions are isolated by analyzing the spectral structure\nof the non-equilibrium propagators without relying on the definition of\nparticle number densities. The mixing source is associated with the usual mass\nshells, whereas the oscillation source is identified with a third intermediate\nshell. In addition, we identify terms lying on the oscillation shell that can\nbe interpreted as the destructive interference between mixing and oscillation.\nWe confirm that identical shell structure is obtained in both the Heisenberg-\nand interaction-picture realizations of the Kadanoff-Baym formalism. In so\ndoing, we illustrate the self-consistency and complementarity of these two\napproaches. The interaction-picture approach in particular has the advantage\nthat it may be used to analyze all forms of mass spectra from quasi-degenerate\nthrough to hierarchical.\n", "  We propose two possible new compounds, Ba$_2$CuO$_2$Fe$_2$As$_2$ and\nK$_2$CuO$_2$Fe$_2$Se$_2$, which hybridize the building blocks of two high\ntemperature superconductors, cuprates and iron-based superconductors. These\ncompounds consist of square CuO$_2$ layers and antifluorite-type Fe$_2$X$_2$\n(X=As,Se) layers separated by Ba/K. The calculations of binding energies and\nphonon spectrums indicate that they are dynamically stable, which ensures that\nthey may be experimentally synthesized. The Fermi surfaces and electronic\nstructures of the two compounds inherit the characteristics of both cuprates\nand iron-based superconductors. These compounds can be superconductors with\nintriguing physical properties to help to determine pairing mechanisms of high\n$T_c$ superconductivity.\n", "  Tokamak stability to, potentially explosive, `ballooning' displacements of\nelliptical magnetic flux tubes is examined in large aspect ratio equilibrium.\nAbove a critical pressure gradient the energy stored in the plasma may be\nlowered by finite (but not infinitesimal) displacements of such tubes\n(metastability). Above a higher pressure gradient, the linear stability\nboundary, such tubes are linearly and nonlinearly unstable. The flux tube\ndisplacement can be of the order of the pressure gradient scale length. Plasma\ntransport from displaced flux tubes may result in rapid loss of confinement.\n", "  We report on the development of on-chip microcavities and show their\npotential as a platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments.\nMicrocavity arrays were formed by the controlled buckling of SiO2/Ta2O5 Bragg\nmirrors, and exhibit a reflectance-limited finesse of 3500 and mode volumes as\nsmall as 35lambda^3. We show that the cavity resonance can be thermally tuned\ninto alignment with the D2 transition of 87Rb, and outline two methods for\nproviding atom access to the cavity. Owing to their small mode volume and high\nfinesse, these cavities exhibit single-atom cooperativities as high as C1 = 65.\nA unique feature of the buckled-dome architecture is that the strong-coupling\nparameter g0/kappa is nearly independent of the cavity size. Furthermore,\nstrong coupling should be achievable with only modest improvements in mirror\nreflectance, suggesting that these monolithic devices could provide a robust\nand scalable solution to the engineering of light-matter interfaces.\n", "  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to study the partial oxidation of\nmethane over a nickel catalyst. Based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism,\nthe kinetic behavior of this reaction is analyzed and the results are compared\nwith previous experiments. This system exhibits kinetic phase transitions\nbetween reactive regions with sustained reaction and poisoned regions without\nreaction. The fractional coverages of the adsorbed species and the production\nrates of H2, CO, H2O, and CO2 are evaluated at steady state as functions of\nfeed concentration of the methane and oxygen, and reaction temperature. The\ninfluence of lattice coordination number, diffusion, and impurities on the\nsurface is investigated. The simulation results are in good agreement with the\nexperimental studies where such results are available. It is observed that when\nthe lattice coordination number is increased to eight, the width of the\nreactive region increases significantly. Moreover, the phase transition becomes\ncontinuous. The diffusion of adsorbed O and H on the surface plays a measurable\nrole in the reaction, increasing the maximum production rates as the diffusion\nrate increases. In systems with impurities, the production rates are greatly\nreduced and the phase transition is also changed from being abrupt to\ncontinuous.\n", "  For the flavour-singlet heavy quark system of charmonia, we compute the\nmasses of the ground state mesons in four different channels: pseudo-scalar\n($\\eta_c(1S)$), vector ($J/\\Psi(1S)$), scalar ($\\chi_{c_0}(1P)$) and axial\nvector ($\\chi_{c_{1}}(1P)$), as well as the weak decay constants of the\n$\\eta_c(1S)$ and $J/\\Psi(1S)$ and the charge radius of $\\eta_c(1S)$. The\nframework for this analysis is provided by a symmetry-preserving\nSchwinger-Dyson equation (SDEs) treatment of a vector$\\times$vector contact\ninteraction (CI). The results found for the meson masses and the weak decay\nconstants, for the spin-spin combinations studied, are in fairly good agreement\nwith experimental data and earlier model calculations based upon\nSchwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSEs) involving sophisticated\ninteraction kernels. The charge radius of $\\eta_c(1S)$ is consistent with the\nresults from refined SDE studies and lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n", "  We present the phase diagram of magnetic states for films of isotropic chiral\nmagnets calculated as function of applied magnetic field and thickness of the\nfilm. We have found a novel magnetic state driven by the natural confinement of\nthe crystal, localized at the surface and stacked on top of the conical bulk\nphase. This magnetic surface state has a three-dimensional (3D) chiral\nspin-texture described by the superposition of helical and cycloidal spin\nspirals. This surface state exists for a large range of applied magnetic fields\nand for any film thickness beyond a critical one. We also identified the whole\nthickness and field range for which the skyrmion lattice becomes the ground\nstate of the system. Below a certain critical thickness the surface state and\nbulk conical phase are suppressed in favor of the skyrmion lattice. Unraveling\nof those phases and the construction of the phase diagram became possible using\nadvanced computational techniques for direct energy minimization applied to a\nbasic 3D model for chiral magnets. Presented results provide a comprehensive\ntheoretical description for those effects already observed in experiments on\nthin films of chiral magnets, predict new effects important for applications\nand open perspectives for experimental studies of such systems.\n", "  We image local structural rearrangements in soft colloidal glasses under\nsmall periodic perturbations induced by thermal cycling. Local structural\nentropy $S_{2}$ positively correlates with observed rearrangements in colloidal\nglasses. The high $S_{2}$ values of the rearranging clusters in glasses\nindicate that fragile regions in glasses are structurally less correlated,\nsimilar to structural defects in crystalline solids. Slow-evolving high $S_{2}$\nspots are capable of predicting local rearrangements long before the\nrelaxations occur, while fluctuation-created high $S_{2}$ spots best correlate\nwith local deformations right before the rearrangement events. Local free\nvolumes are also found to correlate with particle rearrangements at extreme\nvalues, although the ability to identify relaxation sites is substantially\nlower than $S_{2}$. Our experiments provide an efficient structural identifier\nfor the fragile regions in glasses, and highlight the important role of\nstructural correlations in the physics of glasses.\n", "  We have studied the optical properties of gratings micro-fabricated into\nsemiconductor wafers, which can be used for simplifying cold-atom experiments.\nThe study entailed characterisation of diffraction efficiency as a function of\ncoating, periodicity, duty cycle and geometry using over 100 distinct gratings.\nThe critical parameters of experimental use, such as diffraction angle and\nwavelength are also discussed, with an outlook to achieving optimal ultracold\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  The electronic and transport properties of the half-Heusler compound LaPtSb\nare investigated by performing first-principles calculations combined with\nsemi-classical Boltzmann theory and deformation potential theory. Compared with\nmany typical half-Heusler compounds, the LaPtSb exhibits obviously larger power\nfactor at room temperature, especially for the n-type system. Together with the\nvery low lattice thermal conductivity, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT)\nof LaPtSb can be optimized to a record high value of 2.2 by fine tuning the\ncarrier concentration.\n", "  Recent experiments have produced mounting evidence of Majorana zero modes in\nnanowire-superconductor hybrids. Signatures of an expected topological phase\ntransition accompanying the onset of these modes nevertheless remain elusive.\nWe investigate a fundamental question concerning this issue: Do well-formed\nMajorana modes necessarily entail a sharp phase transition in these setups?\nAssuming reasonable parameters, we argue that finite-size effects can\ndramatically smooth this putative transition into a crossover, even in systems\nlarge enough to support well-localized Majorana modes. We propose overcoming\nsuch finite-size effects by examining the behavior of low-lying excited states\nthrough tunneling spectroscopy. In particular, the excited-state energies\nexhibit characteristic field and density dependence, and scaling with system\nsize, that expose an approaching topological phase transition. We suggest\nseveral experiments for extracting the predicted behavior. As a useful\nbyproduct, the protocols also allow one to measure the wire's spin-orbit\ncoupling directly in its superconducting environment.\n", "  We discuss the distribution of commuting distances and its relation to\nincome. Using data from Denmark, the UK, and the US, we show that the commuting\ndistance is (i) broadly distributed with a slow decaying tail that can be\nfitted by a power law with exponent $\\gamma \\approx 3$ and (ii) an average\ngrowing slowly as a power law with an exponent less than one that depends on\nthe country considered. The classical theory for job search is based on the\nidea that workers evaluate the wage of potential jobs as they arrive\nsequentially through time, and extending this model with space, we obtain\npredictions that are strongly contradicted by our empirical findings. We\npropose an alternative model that is based on the idea that workers evaluate\npotential jobs based on a quality aspect and that workers search for jobs\nsequentially across space. We also assume that the density of potential jobs\ndepends on the skills of the worker and decreases with the wage. The predicted\ndistribution of commuting distances decays as $1/r^{3}$ and is independent of\nthe distribution of the quality of jobs. We find our alternative model to be in\nagreement with our data. This type of approach opens new perspectives for the\nmodeling of mobility.\n", "  Estimating the distance of a gas source is important in many applications of\nchemical sensing, like e.g. environmental monitoring, or chemically-guided\nrobot navigation. If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is\navailable, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas\nconcentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where\nfast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are\nrequired to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be\nexploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the\nrelationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local\ngas concentration - the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas\nencounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in\ngas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only\nbeen achieved using photo-ionisation detectors. Here, we demonstrate that by\nappropriate signal processing, off-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors are capable of\nextracting rapidly fluctuating features of gas plumes that strongly correlate\nwith source distance. We show that with a straightforward analysis method it is\npossible to decode events of large, consistent changes in the measured signal,\nso-called 'bouts'. The frequency of these bouts predicts the distance of a gas\nsource in wind-tunnel experiments with good accuracy. In addition, we found\nthat the variance of bout counts indicates cross-wind offset to the centreline\nof the gas plume. Our results offer an alternative approach to estimating gas\nsource proximity that is largely independent of gas concentration, using\noff-the-shelf metal-oxide sensors. The analysis method we employ demands very\nfew computational resources and is suitable for low-power microcontrollers.\n", "  Accurate identification of effective epidemic threshold is essential for\nunderstanding epidemic dynamics on complex networks. The existing studies on\nthe effective epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR)\nmodel generally assume that all infected nodes immediately recover after the\ninfection process, which more or less does not conform to the realistic\nsituation of disease. In this paper, we systematically study the effect of\narbitrary recovery rate on the SIR spreading dynamics on complex networks. We\nderive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size\nbased on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed\ntheoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by\nusing asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating\nmethod is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of\nspreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective\nepidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size\nincreases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical\npredictions and numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world\nnetworks. Our results extend the existing theoretical studies, and help us to\nunderstand the phase transition with arbitrary recovery rate.\n", "  We present the results of the most complete ever scan of the parameter space\nfor cosmic ray (CR) injection and propagation. We perform a Bayesian search of\nthe main GALPROP parameters, using the MultiNest nested sampling algorithm,\naugmented by the BAMBI neural network machine learning package. This is the\nfirst such study to separate out low-mass isotopes ($p$, $\\bar p$ and He) from\nthe usual light elements (Be, B, C, N, O). We find that the propagation\nparameters that best fit $p$, $\\bar p$, He data are significantly different\nfrom those that fit light elements, including the B/C and $^{10}$Be/$^9$Be\nsecondary-to-primary ratios normally used to calibrate propagation parameters.\nThis suggests each set of species is probing a very different interstellar\nmedium, and that the standard approach of calibrating propagation parameters\nusing B/C can lead to incorrect results. We present posterior distributions and\nbest fit parameters for propagation of both sets of nuclei, as well as for the\ninjection abundances of elements from H to Si. The input GALDEF files with\nthese new parameters will be included in an upcoming public GALPROP update.\n", "  We investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures of certain\nhypersurfaces in the thermodynamic geometry of a physical system and show that\nthey contain useful thermodynamic information. For an\nanti-Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m-(A)de Sitter black hole (Phantom), the extrinsic\ncurvature of a constant $Q$ hypersurface has the same sign as the heat capacity\naround the phase transition points. For a Kerr-Newmann-AdS (KN-AdS) black hole,\nthe extrinsic curvature of $Q \\to 0$ hypersurface (Kerr black hole) or $J \\to\n0$ hypersurface (RN black black hole) has the same sign as the heat capacity\naround the phase transition points. The extrinsic curvature also diverges at\nthe phase transition points. The intrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces\ndiverges at the critical points but has no information about the sign of the\nheat capacity. Our study explains the consistent relationship holding between\nthe thermodynamic geometry of the KN-AdS black holes and those of the RN and\nKerr ones \\cite{ref1}. This approach can be easily generalized to an arbitrary\nthermodynamic system.\n", "  Using the Kubo formalism we have calculated the local dynamic conductivity of\na bulk, i.e., three-dimensional (3D), Dirac semimetal (BDS). We obtain that at\nfrequencies lower than Fermi energy the metallic response in a BDS film\nmanifests in the existence of surface-plasmon polaritons, but at higher\nfrequencies the dielectric response is dominated and it occurs that a BDS film\nbehaves as a dielectric waveguide. At this dielectric regime we predict the\nexistence inside a BDS film of novel electromagnetic modes, a 3D analog of the\ntransverse electric waves in graphene. We also find that the dielectric\nresponse manifests as the wide-angle passband in the mid-infrared (IR)\ntransmission spectrum of light incident on a BDS film, which can be used for\nthe interferenceless omnidirectional mid-IR filtering. The tuning of the Fermi\nlevel of the system allows us to switch between the metallic and the dielectric\nregimes and to change the frequency range of the predicted modes. This makes\nBDSs promising materials for photonics and plasmonics.\n", "  Motivated by the recently improved results from the Fermilab Lattice and MILC\nCollaborations on the hadronic matrix elements entering $\\Delta M_{s,d}$ in\n$B_{s,d}^0-\\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixing, we determine the Universal Unitarity\nTriangle (UUT) in models with Constrained Minimal Flavour Violation (CMFV). Of\nparticular importance are the very precise determinations of the ratio\n$|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|=0.0864\\pm0.0025$ and of the angle $\\gamma=(63.0\\pm\n2.1)^\\circ$. They follow in this framework from the experimental values of\n$\\Delta M_{d}/\\Delta M_s$ and of the CP-asymmetry $S_{\\psi K_S}$. As in CMFV\nmodels the new contributions to meson mixings can be described by a single\nflavour-universal variable $S(v)$, we next determine the CKM matrix elements\n$|V_{ts}|$, $|V_{td}|$, $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ as functions of $S(v)$ using\nthe experimental value of $\\Delta M_s$ as input. The lower bound on $S(v)$ in\nthese models, derived by us in 2006, implies then upper bounds on these four\nCKM elements and on the CP-violating parameter $\\varepsilon_K$, which turns out\nto be significantly below its experimental value. This strategy avoids the use\nof tree-level determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ that are presently\nsubject to considerable uncertainties. On the other hand if $\\varepsilon_K$ is\nused instead of $\\Delta M_s$ as input, $\\Delta M_{s,d}$ are found significantly\nabove the data. In this manner we point out that the new lattice data have\nsignificantly sharpened the tension between $\\Delta M_{s,d}$ and\n$\\varepsilon_K$ within the CMFV framework. This implies the presence of new\nphysics contributions beyond this framework that are responsible for the\nbreakdown of the flavour universality of the function $S(v)$. We also present\nthe implications of these results for $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$,\n$K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and $B_{s,d}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ within the Standard Model.\n", "  In new physics searches involving photons at the LHC, one challenge is to\ndistinguish scenarios with isolated photons from models leading to \"photon\njets\". For instance, in the context of the 750 GeV diphoton excess, it was\npointed out that a true diphoton resonance $S \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ can be mimicked\nby a process of the form $p p \\to S \\to a a \\to 4\\gamma$, where $S$ is a new\nscalar with a mass of 750 GeV and $a$ is a light pseudoscalar decaying to two\ncollinear photons. Photon jets can be distinguished from isolated photons by\nexploiting the fact that a large fraction of photons convert to an $e^+e^-$\npair inside the inner detector. In this note, we quantify this discrimination\npower, and we study how the sensitivity of future searches differs for photon\njets compared to isolated photons. We also investigate how our results depend\non the lifetime of the particle(s) decaying to the photon jet. Finally, we\ndiscuss the extension to $S\\to A^\\prime A^\\prime\\to e^+e^-e^+e^-$, where there\nare no photons at all but the dark photon $A^\\prime$ decays to $e^+e^-$ pairs.\nOur results will be useful in future studies of the putative 750 GeV signal,\nbut also more generally in any new physics search involving hard photons.\n", "  Sources of error fields were indirectly inferred in a stellarator by\nreconciling computed and numerical flux surfaces. Sources considered so far\ninclude the displacements and tilts (but not the deformations, yet) of the four\ncircular coils featured in the simple CNT stellarator. The flux surfaces were\nmeasured by means of an electron beam and phosphor rod, and were computed by\nmeans of a Biot-Savart field-line tracing code. If the ideal coil locations and\norientations are used in the computation, agreement with measurements is poor.\nDiscrepancies are ascribed to errors in the positioning and orientation of the\nin-vessel interlocked coils. To that end, an iterative numerical method was\ndeveloped. A Newton-Raphson algorithm searches for the coils' displacements and\ntilts that minimize the discrepancy between the measured and computed flux\nsurfaces. This method was verified by misplacing and tilting the coils in a\nnumerical model of CNT, calculating the flux surfaces that they generated, and\ntesting the algorithm's ability to deduce the coils' displacements and tilts.\nSubsequently, the numerical method was applied to the experimental data,\narriving at a set of coil displacements whose resulting field errors exhibited\nsignificantly improved quantitative and qualitative agreement with experimental\nresults.\n", "  The Lagrange, Euler, and Euler-Poincar\\'{e} variational principles for the\nguiding-center Vlasov-Maxwell equations are presented. Each variational\nprinciple presents a different approach to deriving guiding-center polarization\nand magnetization effects into the guiding-center Maxwell equations. The\nconservation laws of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are also derived by\nNoether method, where the guiding-center stress tensor is now shown to be\nexplicitly symmetric.\n", "  Uncertainty about models and data is ubiquitous in the computational social\nsciences, and it creates a need for robust social network algorithms, which can\nsimultaneously provide guarantees across a spectrum of models and parameter\nsettings. We begin an investigation into this broad domain by studying robust\nalgorithms for the Influence Maximization problem, in which the goal is to\nidentify a set of k nodes in a social network whose joint influence on the\nnetwork is maximized.\n  We define a Robust Influence Maximization framework wherein an algorithm is\npresented with a set of influence functions, typically derived from different\ninfluence models or different parameter settings for the same model. The\ndifferent parameter settings could be derived from observed cascades on\ndifferent topics, under different conditions, or at different times. The\nalgorithm's goal is to identify a set of k nodes who are simultaneously\ninfluential for all influence functions, compared to the (function-specific)\noptimum solutions.\n  We show strong approximation hardness results for this problem unless the\nalgorithm gets to select at least a logarithmic factor more seeds than the\noptimum solution. However, when enough extra seeds may be selected, we show\nthat techniques of Krause et al. can be used to approximate the optimum robust\ninfluence to within a factor of 1 - 1/e. We evaluate this bicriteria\napproximation algorithm against natural heuristics on several real-world data\nsets. Our experiments indicate that the worst-case hardness does not\nnecessarily translate into bad performance on real-world data sets; all\nalgorithms perform fairly well.\n", "  We consider one of the most fundamental sets of hadronic matrix elements,\nnamely the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs), and argue\nthat their existing definitions lack proper evolution properties. By exploiting\nthe similarity of GTMDs with the much better understood transverse momentum\ndistributions, we argue that the existing definitions of GTMDs have to include\nan additional dependence on soft gluon radiation in order to render them\nproperly defined. With this, we manage to obtain the evolution kernel of all\n(un)polarized quark and gluon GTMDs, which turns out to be spin independent. As\na byproduct, all large logarithms can be resummed up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy with the currently known\nperturbative ingredients.\n", "  Thermodynamics of trajectories promises to make possible the thorough\nanalysis of the dynamical properties of an open quantum system, a sought-after\ngoal in modern physics. Unfortunately, calculation of the relevant quantities\npresents severe challenges. Determining the large-deviation function that gives\naccess to the full counting statistics associated with a dynamical order\nparameter is challenging, if not impossible, even for systems evolving in a\nrestricted Liouville space. Acting on the realisation that the salient features\nof most dynamical systems are encoded in the first few moments of the counting\nstatistics, in this article we present a method that gives sequential access to\nthese moments. Our method allows for obtaining analytical result in several\ncases, as we illustrate, and allows using large deviation theory to reinterpret\ncertain well-known results.\n", "  A fractional time derivative is introduced into the Burger's equation to\nmodel losses of nonlinear waves. This term amounts to a time convolution\nproduct, which greatly penalizes the numerical modeling. A diffusive\nrepresentation of the fractional derivative is adopted here, replacing this\nnonlocal operator by a continuum of memory variables that satisfy local-in-time\nordinary differential equations. Then a quadrature formula yields a system of\nlocal partial differential equations, well-suited to numerical integration. The\ndetermination of the quadrature coefficients is crucial to ensure both the\nwell-posedness of the system and the computational efficiency of the diffusive\napproximation. For this purpose, optimization with constraint is shown to be a\nvery efficient strategy. Strang splitting is used to solve successively the\nhyperbolic part by a shock-capturing scheme, and the diffusive part exactly.\nNumerical experiments are proposed to assess the efficiency of the numerical\nmodeling, and to illustrate the effect of the fractional attenuation on the\nwave propagation.\n", "  The electron waiting time is the time that passes between two subsequent\ncharge transfers in an electronic conductor. Recently, theories of electron\nwaiting times have been devised for quantum transport in Coulomb-blockade\nstructures and for mesoscopic conductors, however, so far a proper description\nof a detector has been missing. Here we develop a quantum theory of a waiting\ntime clock capable of measuring the distribution of waiting times between\nelectrons above the Fermi sea in a mesoscopic conductor. The detector consists\nof a mesoscopic capacitor coupled to a quantum two-level system whose coherent\nprecession we monitor. Under ideal operating conditions our waiting time clock\nrecovers the results of earlier theories without a detector. We investigate\npossible deviations due to an imperfect waiting time clock. As specific\napplications we consider a quantum point contact with a constant voltage and\nlorentzian voltage pulses applied to an electrode.\n", "  Spin glasses have competing interactions that lead to a rough energy\nlandscape which is highly susceptible to small perturbations. These chaotic\neffects strongly affect numerical simulations and, as such, gaining a deeper\nunderstanding of chaos in spin glasses is of much importance. The use of\nthermal boundary conditions is an effective approach to study chaotic\nphenomena. Here, we generalize population annealing Monte Carlo, combined with\nthermal boundary conditions, to study bond chaos due to small perturbations in\nthe spin-spin couplings of the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Ising spin\nglass. We show that bond and temperature-induced chaos share the same scaling\nexponents and that bond chaos is stronger than temperature chaos.\n", "  A steepening feature in the outer density profiles of dark matter halos\nindicating the splashback radius has drawn much attention recently. Possible\nobservational detections have even been made for galaxy clusters.\nTheoretically, Adhikari et al. have estimated the location of the splashback\nradius by computing the secondary infall trajectory of a dark matter shell\nthrough a growing dark matter halo with an NFW profile. However, since they\nimposed a shape of the halo profile rather than computing it consistently from\nthe trajectories of the dark matter shells, they could not provide the full\nshape of the dark matter profile around the splashback radius. We improve on\nthis by extending the self-similar spherical collapse model of Fillmore \\&\nGoldreich to a $\\Lambda$CDM universe. This allows us to compute the dark matter\nhalo profile and the trajectories simultaneously from the mass accretion\nhistory. Our results on the splashback location agree qualitatively with\nAdhikari et al. but with small quantitative differences at large mass accretion\nrates. We present new fitting formulae for the splashback radius $R_{\\rm sp}$\nin various forms, including the ratios of $R_{\\rm sp} / R_{\\rm 200c}$ and\n$R_{\\rm sp} / R_{\\rm 200m}$. Numerical simulations have made the puzzling\ndiscovery that the splashback radius scales well with $R_{\\rm 200m}$ but not\nwith $R_{\\rm 200c}$. We trace the origin of this to be the correlated increase\nof $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and the average halo mass accretion rate with an increasing\nredshift.\n", "  A search for muon neutrinos originating from dark matter annihilations in the\nSun is performed using the data recorded by the ANTARES neutrino telescope from\n2007 to 2012. In order to obtain the best possible sensitivities to dark matter\nsignals, an optimisation of the event selection criteria is performed taking\ninto account the background of atmospheric muons, atmospheric neutrinos and the\nenergy spectra of the expected neutrino signals. No significant excess over the\nbackground is observed and $90\\%$ C.L. upper limits on the neutrino flux, the\nspin--dependent and spin--independent WIMP-nucleon cross--sections are derived\nfor WIMP masses ranging from $ \\rm 50$ GeV to $\\rm 5$ TeV for the annihilation\nchannels $\\rm WIMP + WIMP \\to b \\bar b, W^+ W^-$ and $\\rm \\tau^+ \\tau^-$.\n", "  The aberration and Doppler coupling effects of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) were recently measured by the Planck satellite. The most\nstraightforward interpretation leads to a direct detection of our peculiar\nvelocity $\\beta$, consistent with the measurement of the well-known dipole. In\nthis paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that\nDoppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a\nsecond order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational\npotential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we\nassume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,\ndetecting a discrepancy in the value of $\\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler\ncouplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show\nthat aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our\npeculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar\ngravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial\nconditions. In general such effects are not degenerate and so a discrepancy\nbetween the measured $\\beta$ from the dipole and aberration could be accounted\nfor by a dipolar gravitational potential. Only through a fine-tuning of the\nradial profile of the potential it is possible to have a complete degeneracy\nwith a boost effect. Finally we discuss that we also expect other signatures\ndue to integrated second order terms, which may be further used to disentangle\nthis scenario from a simple boost.\n", "  Measurements of charged jet production as a function of centrality are\npresented for p-Pb collisions recorded at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with\nthe ALICE detector. Centrality classes are determined via the energy deposit in\nneutron calorimeters at zero degree, close to the beam direction, to minimise\ndynamical biases of the selection. The corresponding number of participants or\nbinary nucleon-nucleon collisions is determined based on the particle\nproduction in the Pb-going rapidity region. Jets have been reconstructed in the\ncentral rapidity region from charged particles with the anti-$k_{\\rm T}$\nalgorithm for resolution parameters $R = 0.2$ and $R = 0.4$ in the transverse\nmomentum range 20 to 120 GeV/$c$. The reconstructed jet momentum and yields\nhave been corrected for detector effects and underlying-event background. In\nthe five centrality bins considered, the charged jet production in p-Pb\ncollisions is consistent with the production expected from binary scaling from\npp collisions. The ratio of jet yields reconstructed with the two different\nresolution parameters is also independent of the centrality selection,\ndemonstrating the absence of major modifications of the radial jet structure in\nthe reported centrality classes.\n", "  Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy of aerosol droplets is a promising\nmethod for the determination of electron mean free paths in liquids. It is\nparticularly attractive for volatile liquids, such as water. Here we report the\nfirst angle-resolved photoelectron images of droplets with defined sizes, viz.\nof water, glycerol, and dioctyl phthalate droplets. Example simulations of\nwater droplet photoelectron images and data for electron mean free paths for\nliquid water at low kinetic energy (< 3eV) are provided. We present an approach\nthat allows one to gradually vary the conditions from shadowing to nanofocusing\nto optimize the information content contained in the photoelectron images.\n", "  We present results from the first fully relativistic simulations of the\ncritical collapse of rotating radiation fluids. We observe critical scaling\nboth in subcritical evolutions, in which case the fluid disperses to infinity\nand leaves behind flat space, and in supercritical evolutions that lead to the\nformation of black holes. We measure the mass and angular momentum of these\nblack holes, and find that both show critical scaling with critical exponents\nthat are consistent with perturbative results. The critical exponents are\nuniversal; they are not affected by angular momentum, and are independent of\nthe direction in which the critical curve, which separates subcritical from\nsupercritical evolutions in our two-dimensional parameter space, is crossed. In\nparticular, these findings suggest that the angular momentum decreases more\nrapidly than the square of the mass, so that, as criticality is approached, the\ncollapse leads to the formation of a non-spinning black hole. We also\ndemonstrate excellent agreement of our numerical data with new closed-form\nextensions of power-law scalings that describe the mass and angular momentum of\nrotating black holes formed close to criticality.\n", "  A radio source that faded over six days, with a redshift of $z\\approx0.5$\nhost, has been identified by Keane et al. (2016) as the transient afterglow to\na fast radio burst (FRB 150418). We report follow-up radio and optical\nobservations of the afterglow candidate and find a source that is consistent\nwith an active galactic nucleus. If the afterglow candidate is nonetheless a\nprototypical FRB afterglow, existing slow-transient surveys limit the fraction\nof FRBs that produce afterglows to 0.25 for afterglows with fractional\nvariation, $m=2|S_1-S_2|/(S_1+S_2)\\geq0.7$, and 0.07 for $m\\geq1$, at 95%\nconfidence. In anticipation of a barrage of bursts expected from future FRB\nsurveys, we provide a simple framework for statistical association of FRBs with\nafterglows. Our framework properly accounts for statistical uncertainties, and\nensures consistency with limits set by slow-transient surveys.\n", "  A physically-motivated function was developed to accurately determine the\ntotal absorption peak in an electromagnetic calorimeter and to overcome biases\npresent in many commonly used methods. The function is the convolution of a\ndetector resolution function with the sum of a delta function, which represents\nthe complete absorption of energy, and a tail function, which describes the\npartial absorption of energy and depends on the detector materials and\nstructures. Its performance was tested with the simulation of three typical\ncases. The accuracy of the extracted peak value, resolution, and peak area was\nimproved by an order of magnitude on average, relative to the Crystal Ball\nfunction.\n", "  Traditionally, spectroscopy is performed by examining the position of\nabsorption lines. However, at frequencies near the transition frequency,\nadditional information can be obtained from the phase shift. In this work we\nconsider the information about the transition frequency obtained from both the\nabsorption and the phase shift, as quantified by the Fisher information in an\ninterferometric measurement. We examine the use of multiple single-photon\nstates, NOON states, and numerically optimized states that are entangled and\nhave multiple photons. We find the optimized states that improve over the\nstandard quantum limit set by independent single photons for some atom number\ndensities.\n", "  We study the environment assisted local transitionless dynamics in closed\nspin systems driven through quantum critical points. In general shortcut to\nadaiabaticity (STA) in quantum critical systems requires highly non-local\ncontrol Hamiltonians. In this work we develop an approach to achieve local\nshortcuts to adiabaticity (LSTA) in spin chains, using local control fields\nwhich scale polynomially with the system size, following universal critical\nexponents. We relate the control fields to reduced fidelity susceptibility and\nuse transverse Ising model in one dimension to exemplify our generic results.\nWe also extend our analysis to achieve LSTA in central spin models.\n", "  Continuous-time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general\ntechniques for quantum computing, both of which are described by Hamiltonians\nthat govern their evolutions by Schr\\\"odinger's equation. In the former, the\nHamiltonian is fixed, while in the latter, the Hamiltonian varies with time. As\na result, their formulations of Grover's algorithm evolve differently through\nHilbert space. We show that this difference is fundamental; they cannot be made\nto evolve along each other's path without introducing structure more powerful\nthan the standard oracle for unstructured search. For an adiabatic quantum\nevolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm, it must interpolate\nbetween three fixed Hamiltonians, one of which is complex and introduces\nstructure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Conversely,\nfor a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm,\nit must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted, directed star graph with\nstructure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Thus\nthe two techniques, although similar in being described by Hamiltonians that\ngovern their evolution, compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means.\n", "  The standard central limit theorem with a Gaussian attractor for the sum of\nindependent random variables may lose its validity in presence of strong\ncorrelations between the added random contributions. Here, we study this\nproblem for similar interchangeable globally correlated random variables. Under\nthese conditions, a hierarchical set of equations is derived for the\nconditional transition probabilities. This result allows us to define different\nclasses of memory mechanisms that depend on a symmetric way on all involved\nvariables. Depending on the correlation mechanisms and single statistics, the\ncorresponding sums are characterized by distinct statistical probability\ndensities. For a class of urn models it is also possible to characterize their\ndomain of attraction which, as in the standard case, is parametrized by the\nprobability density of each random variable. Symmetric and asymmetric\n$q$-Gaussian attractors $(q<1)$ are a particular case of these models.\n", "  We study a general double Dirac delta potential to show that this is the\nsimplest yet versatile solvable potential to introduce double wells, avoided\ncrossings, resonances and perfect transmission ($T=1$). Perfect transmission\nenergies turn out to be the critical property of symmetric and anti-symmetric\ncases wherein these discrete energies are found to correspond to the\neigenvalues of Dirac delta potential placed symmetrically between two rigid\nwalls. For well(s) or barrier(s), perfect transmission [or zero reflectivity,\n$R(E)$] at energy $E=0$ is non-intuitive. However, earlier this has been found\nand called \"threshold anomaly\". Here we show that it is a critical phenomena\nand we can have $ 0 \\le R(0)<1$ when the parameters of the double delta\npotential satisfy an interesting condition. We also invoke zero-energy and zero\ncurvature eigenstate ($\\psi(x)=Ax+B$) of delta well between two symmetric rigid\nwalls for $R(0)=0$. We resolve that the resonant energies and the perfect\ntransmission energies are different and they arise differently.\n", "  We study the importance of local structural properties in networks which have\nbeen evolved for a power-law scaling in their Laplacian spectrum. To this end,\nthe degree distribution, two-point degree correlations, and degree-dependent\nclustering are extracted from the evolved networks and used to construct random\nnetworks with the prescribed distributions. In the analysis of these\nreconstructed networks it turns out that the degree distribution alone is not\nsufficient to generate the spectral scaling and the degree-dependent clustering\nhas only an indirect influence. The two-point correlations are found to be the\ndominant characteristic for the power-law scaling over a broader eigenvalue\nrange.\n", "  We explore a new way of producing the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for\nultracold atoms by using a two-component (spinor) atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) confined in a bilayer geometry. The SOC of the Rashba type is\ncreated if the atoms pick up a {\\pi} phase after completing a cyclic transition\nbetween four combined spin-layer states composed of two spin and two layer\nstates. The cyclic coupling of the spin-layer states is carried out by\ncombining an intralayer Raman coupling and an interlayer laser assisted\ntunneling. We theoretically determine the ground-state phases of the\nspin-orbit-coupled BEC for various strengths of the atom-atom interaction and\nthe laser-assisted coupling. It is shown that the bilayer scheme provides a\ndiverse ground-state phase diagram. In an intermediate range of the atom-light\ncoupling two interlacing lattices of half- skyrmions and half-antiskyrmions are\nspontaneously created. In the strong-coupling regime, where the SOC of the\nRashba-type is formed, the ground state represents plane-wave or standing-wave\nphases depending on the interaction between the atoms. A variational analysis\nis shown to be in a good agreement with the numerical results.\n", "  Screened modified gravity (SMG) is a kind of scalar-tensor theories with\nscreening mechanisms, which can generate screening effect to suppress the fifth\nforce in high density environments and pass the solar system tests. Meanwhile,\nthe potential of scalar field in the theories can drive the acceleration of the\nlate universe. In this paper, we calculate the parameterized post-Newtonian\n(PPN) parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$, the effective gravitational constant\n$G_{\\rm eff}$ and the effective cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ for SMG with a\ngeneral potential $V$ and coupling function $A$. The dependence of these\nparameters on the model parameters of SMG and/or the physical properties of the\nsource object are clearly presented. As an application of these results, we\nfocus on three specific theories of SMG (chameleon, symmetron and dilaton\nmodels). Using the formulae to calculate their PPN parameters and cosmological\nconstant, we derive the constraints on the model parameters by combining the\nobservations on solar system and cosmological scales.\n", "  In models with discrete flavour symmetries, flavons are critical to realise\nspecific flavour structures. Leptonic flavour mixing originates from the\nmisalignment of flavon vacuum expectation values which respect different\nresidual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. Flavon cross\ncouplings are usually forbidden, in order to protect these symmetries. Contrary\nto this approach, we show that cross couplings can play a key role and give\nraise to necessary corrections to flavour-mixing patterns, including a non-zero\nvalue for the reactor angle and CP violation. For definiteness, we present two\nmodels based on $A_4$. In the first model, all flavons are assumed to be real\nor pseudo-real, with 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector in total. A\nsizable reactor angle associated with nearly maximal CP violation is achieved,\nand, as both originate from the same cross coupling, a sum rule results with a\nprecise prediction for the value of the Dirac CP-violating phase. In the second\nmodel, the flavons are taken to be complex scalars, which can be connected with\nsupersymmetric models and multi-Higgs models. The complexity properties of\nflavons provide new sources for generating the reactor angle. Models in this\nnew approach introduce very few degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model\nand can be more economical than those in the framework of extra dimension or\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  This paper describes an updated exponential Fourier based split-step method\nthat can be applied to a greater class of partial differential equations than\nprevious methods would allow. These equations arise in physics and engineering,\na notable example being the generalized derivative non-linear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation that arises in non-linear optics with self-steepening terms. These\ndifferential equations feature terms that were previously inaccessible to model\naccurately with low computational resources. The new method maintains a 3rd\norder error even with these additional terms and models the equation in all\nthree spatial dimensions and time. The class of non-linear differential\nequations that this method applies to is shown. The method is fully derived and\nimplementation of the method in the split-step architecture is shown. This\npaper lays the mathematical ground work for an upcoming paper employing this\nmethod in white-light generation simulations in bulk material.\n", "  We explore the quantum phase transition between Peierls and\ncharge-density-wave insulating states in the one-dimensional, half-filled,\nextended Hubbard model with explicit bond dimerization. We show that the\ncritical line of the continuous Ising transition terminates at a tricritical\npoint, belonging to the universality class of the tricritical Ising model with\ncentral charge $c=7/10$. Above this point, the quantum phase transition becomes\nfirst order. Employing a numerical matrix-product-state based (infinite)\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method we determine the ground-state phase\ndiagram, the spin and two-particle charge excitations gaps, and the\nentanglement properties of the model with high precision. Performing a\nbosonization analysis we can derive a field description of the transition\nregion in terms of a triple sine-Gordon model. This allows us to derive field\ntheory predictions for the power-law (exponential) decay of the density-density\n(spin-spin) and bond-order-wave correlation functions, which are found to be in\nexcellent agreement with our numerical results.\n", "  Recent reports of a weak unidentified emission line at ~3.5 keV found in\nspectra of several matter-dominated objects may give a clue to resolve the\nlong-standing problem of dark matter. One of the best physically motivated\nparticle candidate able to produce such an extra line is sterile neutrino with\nthe mass of ~7 keV. Previous works show that sterile neutrino dark matter with\nparameters consistent with the new line measurement modestly affects structure\nformation compared to conventional cold dark matter scenario. In this work, we\nconcentrate for the first time on contribution of the sterile neutrino dark\nmatter able to produce the observed line at ~3.5 keV, to the process of\nreionization. By incorporating dark matter power spectra for ~7 keV sterile\nneutrinos into extended semi-analytical 'bubble' model of reionization we\nobtain that such sterile neutrino dark matter would produce significantly\nsharper reionization compared to widely used cold dark matter models,\nimpossible to 'imitate' within the cold dark matter scenario under any\nreasonable choice of our model parameters, and would have a clear tendency of\nlowering both the redshift of reionization and the electron scattering optical\ndepth (although the difference is still below the existing model\nuncertainties). Further dedicated studies of reionization (such as 21 cm\nmeasurements or studies of kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect) will thus be\nessential for reconstruction of particle candidate responsible the ~3.5 keV\nline.\n", "  We consider the possibility of multiply-connected spacetimes, ranging from\nthe Flamm-Einstein-Rosen bridge, geons, and the modern renaissance of\ntraversable wormholes. A fundamental property in wormhole physics is the\nflaring-out condition of the throat, which through the Einstein field equation\nentails the violation of the null energy condition. In the context of modified\ntheories of gravity, it has also been shown that the normal matter can be\nimposed to satisfy the energy conditions, and it is the higher order curvature\nterms, interpreted as a gravitational fluid, that sustain these non-standard\nwormhole geometries, fundamentally different from their counterparts in general\nrelativity. We explore interesting features of these geometries, in particular,\nthe physical properties and characteristics of these `exotic spacetimes'.\n", "  In a broad class of theories, the relic abundance of dark matter is\ndetermined by interactions internal to a thermalized dark sector, with no\ndirect involvement of the Standard Model (SM). We point out that these theories\nraise an immediate cosmological question: how was the dark sector initially\npopulated in the early universe? Motivated in part by the difficulty of\naccommodating large amounts of entropy carried in dark radiation with cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic\nspecies at recombination, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we aim to establish which\nadmissible cosmological histories can populate a thermal dark sector that never\nreaches thermal equilibrium with the SM. The minimal cosmological origin for\nsuch a dark sector is asymmetric reheating, when the same mechanism that\npopulates the SM in the early universe also populates the dark sector at a\nlower temperature. Here we demonstrate that the resulting inevitable\ninflaton-mediated scattering between the dark sector and the SM can wash out a\nwould-be temperature asymmetry, and establish the regions of parameter space\nwhere temperature asymmetries can be generated in minimal reheating scenarios.\nThus obtaining a temperature asymmetry of a given size either restricts\npossible inflaton masses and couplings or necessitates a non-minimal cosmology\nfor one or both sectors. As a side benefit, we develop techniques for\nevaluating collision terms in the relativistic Boltzmann equation when the full\ndependence on Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac phase space distributions must be\nretained, and present several new results on relativistic thermal averages in\nan appendix.\n", "  We construct lattice action for five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory. This supersymmetric lattice formulation can be used to\nexplore the non-perturbative regime of the continuum target theory, which has a\nknown gravitational dual.\n", "  We propose a hypothetical heavy leptonium, the scalar bound state of an\nexotic lepton-antilepton pair, as a candidate for the recent 750 GeV resonance\nin the early LHC Run 2 data. Such a para-leptonium is dominantly produced via\nphoton-photon fusion at the LHC and decays into a photon pair with a\nsignificant branching fraction. In addition, our model predicts a companion\nspin-1 ortho-leptonium bound state, which can decay to $W^+W^-$, $f\\bar{f}$ and\nthree photons. Under the LHC and the electroweak precision observables bounds,\nwe find that the observed excess of 750 GeV diphoton events can be explained\nwithin $2\\sigma$ accuracy for $Y_{L} \\approx 4.8 - 7.2$ for the minimal case in\nour scenario. The observation of the ortho-leptonium in the dilepton channel\nwill be the smoking gun for our scenario.\n", "  We perform X-ray/ultraviolet (UV) spectral and X-ray variability studies of\nthe radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy RX J1633.3+4719 using\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations from 2011 and 2012. The 0.3-10 keV spectra\nconsist of an ultrasoft component described by an accretion disc blackbody\n(kT_in = 39.6^{+11.2}_{-5.5} eV) and a power law due to the thermal\nComptonization ({\\Gamma} = 1.96^{+0.24}_{-0.31}) of the disc emission. The disc\ntemperature inferred from the soft excess is at least a factor of 2 lower than\nthat found for the canonical soft excess emission from radio-quiet NLS1s. The\nUV spectrum is described by a power law with photon index 3.05^{+0.56}_{-0.33}.\nThe observed UV emission is too strong to arise from the accretion disc or the\nhost galaxy, but can be attributed to a jet. The X-ray emission from RX\nJ1633.3+4719 is variable with fractional variability amplitude $F_{\\rm\nvar}$=13.5$\\pm1.0$ per cent. In contrast to radio-quiet active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), X-ray emission from the source becomes harder with increasing flux. The\nfractional rms variability increases with energy and the rms spectrum is well\ndescribed by a constant disc component and a variable power-law continuum with\nthe normalization and photon index being anticorrelated. Such spectral\nvariability cannot be caused by variations in the absorption and must be\nintrinsic to the hot corona. Our finding of possible evidence for emission from\nthe inner accretion disc, jet and hot corona from RX J1633.3+4719 in the\noptical to X-ray bands makes this object an ideal target to probe the disc-jet\nconnection in AGN.\n", "  Mean-field theory (MFT) is one of the main available tools for analytical\ncalculations entailed in investigations regarding many-body systems. Recently,\nthere have been an urge of interest in ameliorating this kind of method, mainly\nwith the aim of incorporating geometric and correlation properties of these\nsystems. The correlated cluster MFT (CCMFT) is an improvement that succeeded\nquite well in doing that for classical spin systems. Nevertheless, even the\nCCMFT presents some deficiencies when applied to quantum systems. In this\narticle, we address this issue by proposing the quantum CCMFT (QCCMFT), which,\nin contrast to its former approach, uses general quantum states in its\nself-consistent mean-field equations. We apply the introduced QCCMFT to the\ntransverse Ising model in honeycomb, square, and simple cubic lattices and\nobtain fairly good results both for the Curie temperature of thermal phase\ntransition and for the critical field of quantum phase transition. Actually,\nour results match those obtained via exact solutions, series expansions or\nMonte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We discuss a possibility to explain the excess of $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ at one-loop\nlevel. We introduce three generation of vector-like lepton doublet $L'$ and two\nsinglet scalars $S_{1,2}$ which are odd under $Z_2$, while all the standard\nmodel fields are even under this discrete symmetry. We show that $S_1$ can be a\ngood dark matter candidate. We show that we can explain the dark matter relic\nabundance, large part of the discrepancy of muon $g-2$ between experiments and\nthe standard model predictions, as well as the $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ excess of $\\sim 1$\n%, while evading constraints from experiments of dark matter direct detection\nand charged lepton flavor violating processes. We also consider prospects of\nproduction of $S_2$ at LHC with energy $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.\n", "  Apart from the known weak gravitational lensing effect, the cosmic\nmagnification acquires relativistic corrections owing to Doppler, integrated\nSachs-Wolfe, time-delay and other (local) gravitational potential effects,\nrespectively. These corrections grow on very large scales and high redshifts z,\nwhich will be the reach of forthcoming surveys. In this work, these\nrelativistic corrections are investigated in the magnification angular power\nspectrum, using both (standard) noninteracting dark energy (DE), and\ninteracting DE (IDE). It is found that for noninteracting DE, the relativistic\ncorrections can boost the magnification large-scale power by ~ 40% at z = 3,\nand increases at lower z. It is also found that the IDE effect is sensitive to\nthe relativistic corrections in the magnification power spectrum, particularly\nat low z---which will be crucial for constraints on IDE. Moreover, the results\nshow that if relativistic corrections are not taken into account, this may lead\nto an incorrect estimate of the large-scale imprint of IDE in the cosmic\nmagnification; including the relativistic corrections can enhance the true\npotential of the cosmic magnification as a cosmological probe.\n", "  We propose here a two-dimensional material based on a single layer of violet\nor Hittorf's phosphorus. Using first-principles density functional theory, we\nfind it to be energetically very stable, comparable to other previously\nproposed single-layered phosphorus structures. It requires only a small\nenergetic cost of approximately $0.04~\\text{eV/atom}$ to be created from its\nbulk structure, Hittorf's phosphorus, or a binding energy of\n$0.3-0.4~\\text{J/m}^2$ per layer, suggesting the possibility of exfoliation in\nexperiments. We find single-layered Hittorf's phosphorus to be a wide band gap\nsemiconductor with a direct band gap of approximately $2.5$~eV and our\ncalculations show it is expected to have a high and highly anisotropic hole\nmobility with an upper bound lying between $3000-7000$~cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$.\nThese combined properties make single-layered Hittorf's phosphorus a very good\ncandidate for future applications in a wide variety of technologies, in\nparticular for high frequency electronics, and optoelectronic devices operating\nin the low wavelength blue color range.\n", "  A remarkable property of modern cosmology is that it allows for a special\ncase of symmetry, consisting in the possibility of describing the early-time\nacceleration (inflation) and the late-time acceleration using the same\ntheoretical framework. In this paper we consider various cosmological models\ncorresponding to a generalized form for the equation of state for the fluid in\na flat Friedmann -Robertson-Walker universe, emphasizing cases where the\nso-called type IV singular inflation is encountered in the future. This is a\nsoft (non-crushing) kind of singularity. Parameter values for an inhomogeneous\nequation of state leading to singular inflation are obtained. We present models\nfor which there are two type IV singularities, the first corresponding to the\nend of the inflationary era and the second to a late time event. We also study\nthe correspondence between the theoretical slow-roll parameters leading to type\nIV singular inflation and the recent results observed by the Planck satellite.\n", "  If the set of points where a function is nonzero is of finite measure, and\nits Weyl transform is a finite rank operator, then the function is identically\nzero.\n", "  A design of a magnonic phase shifter operating without an external bias\nmagnetic field is proposed. The phase shifter uses a localized collective spin\nwave mode propagating along a domain wall \"waveguide\" in a dipolarly-coupled\nmagnetic dot array existing in a chessboard antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ground\nstate. It is demonstrated numerically that remagnetization of a single magnetic\ndot adjacent to the domain wall waveguide introduces a controllable phase shift\nin the propagating spin wave mode without significant change of the mode\namplitude. It is also demonstrated that a logic XOR gate can be realized in the\nsame system.\n", "  Properties of solutions of the RPA equation is reanalyzed mathematically,\nwhich is defined as a generalized eigenvalue problem of the stability matrix\n$\\mathsf{S}$ with the norm matrix $\\mathsf{N}=\\mathrm{diag.}(1,-1)$. As well as\nphysical solutions, unphysical solutions are examined in detail, with taking\nthe possibility of Jordan blocks of the matrix $\\mathsf{N\\,S}$ into\nconsideration. Two types of duality of eigenvectors and basis vectors of the\nJordan blocks are pointed out and explored, which disclose many basic\nproperties of the RPA solutions.\n", "  In this paper we derive the dielectric tensor for a plasma containing\nparticles described by an anisotropic superthermal (bi-kappa) velocity\ndistribution function. The tensor components are written in terms of the\ntwo-variables kappa plasma special functions, recently defined by Gaelzer and\nZiebell [Phys. Plasmas 23, 022110 (2016)]. We also obtain various new\nmathematical properties for these functions, which are useful for the\nanalytical treatment, numerical implementation and evaluation of the functions\nand, consequently, of the dielectric tensor. The formalism developed here and\nin the previous paper provides a mathematical framework for the study of\nelectromagnetic waves propagating at arbitrary angles and polarizations in a\nsuperthermal plasma.\n", "  Bino-like dark matter in supersymmetric theories tends to suffer from\nover-production. This problem can be evaded if there is another gaugino which\nhas a mass close to the bino mass so that it enhances the annihilation rate of\nbino dark matter through coannihilation. We study such possibilities in\nhigh-scale supersymmetric models, and show that searches for long-lived\nparticles with displaced vertices can test the bino-gaugino coannihilation\nscenario in the forthcoming LHC experiments.\n", "  Recently a special vortex string was found [5] in a class of soliton vortices\nsupported in four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories that under certain conditions\ncan become infinitely thin and can be interpreted as a critical ten-dimensional\nstring. The appropriate bulk Yang-Mills theory has the U(2) gauge group and the\nFayet-Iliopoulos term. It supports semilocal non-Abelian vortices with the\nworld-sheet theory for orientational and size moduli described by the weighted\nCP(2,2) model. The full target space is R_4\\times Y_6 where Y_6 is a\nnon-compact Calabi-Yau space.\n  We study the above vortex string from the standpoint of string theory,\nfocusing on the massless states in four dimensions. In the generic case all\nmassless modes are non-normalizable, hence, no massless gravitons or vector\nfields are predicted in the physical spectrum. However, at the selfdual point\n(at strong coupling) weighted CP(2,2) admits deformation of the complex\nstructure, resulting in a single massless hypermultiplet in the bulk. We\ninterpret it as a composite \"baryon.\"\n", "  In this paper we: 1) show how the smooth geometry of spaces of normal quantum\nstates over W*-algebras (generalised spaces of density matrices) may be used to\nsubstantially enrich the description of quantum dynamics in the algebraic and\npath integral approaches; 2) discuss a framework for postquantum information\ntheories, such that quantum mechanical linearity holds only locally, while the\nnonlocal multi-user dynamics exhibits some similarity with general relativity.\nIn the algebraic setting, we propose a method of incorporating nonlinear\nPoisson and relative entropic local dynamics, as well as local gauge and local\nsource structures, into an effective description of local temporal evolution of\nquantum states by using fibrewise perturbations of liouvilleans in the fibre\nbundle of Hilbert spaces. In the path integral setting, we incorporate local\ngeometry by a generalisation of the Daubechies--Klauder coherent state phase\nspace propagator formula. Finally, we discuss the role of Bregman relative\nentropy in the Jaynes--Mitchell--Favretti renormalisation scheme. As a result,\nwe show that: 1) the propagation of quantum particles (in Wigner's sense) can\nbe naturally explained as a free fall along the trajectories locally minimising\nthe quantum relative entropy; 2) the contribution of particular trajectories to\nthe global path integral is weighted by the local quantum entropic prior,\nmeasuring user's lack of information; 3) the presence of nonlinear quantum\ncontrol variables results in the change of the curvature of the global quantum\nstate space; 4) the behaviour of zero-point energy under renormalisation of\nlocal entropic dynamics is maintained by local redefinition of information mass\n(prior), which encodes the curvature change. This leads us to a new framework\nfor nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics based on quantum Orlicz\nspaces, quantum Bregman distances and Banach Lie algebras.\n", "  Kondo-like effect, namely the upturn of resistivity at low temperatures, has\nbeen observed in perovskite manganite when nonmagnetic insulators were doped as\nthe secondary phase. In this paper, the low-temperature resistivity upturn\neffect was argued to be originated from the interfacial magnetic phase\nreconstruction. Heisenberg spin lattices have been simulated using Monte Carlo\nmethod to reveal the phase competition around the secondary phase boundary,\nnamely the manganite-insulator boundary behaves a weak antiferromagnetic\ntendency. And the resistor-network model based on the double-exchange\nconductive mechanism indeed reproduces the low-temperature resistivity upturn\neffect. Our work provide a reasonable physical mechanism to understand novel\ntransport behaviors in micro-structures of correlated electron systems.\n", "  The structural transition at about 1000 {\\deg}C, from the hexagonal to the\northorhombic phase of LuFeO3, has been investigated in thin films of LuFeO3.\nSeparation of the two structural phases of LuFeO3 occurs on a length scale of\nmicrometer, as visualized in real space using X-ray photoemission electron\nmicroscopy (X-PEEM). The results are consistent with X-ray diffraction and\natomic force microscopy obtained from LuFeO3 thin films undergoing the\nirreversible structural transition from the hexagonal to the orthorhombic phase\nof LuFeO3, at elevated temperatures. The sharp phase boundaries between the\nstructural phases are observed to align with the crystal planes of the\nhexagonal LuFeO3 phase. The coexistence of different structural domains\nindicates that the irreversible structural transition, from the hexagonal to\nthe orthorhombic phase in LuFeO3, is a first order transition, for epitaxial\nhexagonal LuFeO3 films grown on Al2O3.\n", "  Control of the swelling, chemical functionalization, and adhesivity of\nhydrogels are finding new applications in a wide range of material systems. We\ninvestigate experimentally the effect of adsorbed particles on hydrogels on the\ndepinning of contact lines. In our experiments, a water drop containing\npolystyrene microspheres is deposited on a swelling hydrogel, which leads to\nthe drop absorption and particle deposition. Two regimes are observed: a\ndecreasing drop height with a pinned contact line followed by a receding\ncontact line. We show that increasing the particles concentration increases the\nduration of the first regime and significantly decreases the total absorption\ntime. The adsorbed particles increase the pinning force at the contact line.\nFinally, we develop a method to measure the receding contact angle with the\nconsideration of the hydrogel swelling.\n", "  The magnetoelectroluminescence of conjugated organic polymer films is widely\naccepted to arise from a polaron pair mechanism, but their magnetoconductance\nis less well understood. Here we derive a new relationship between the\nexperimentally measurable magnetoelectroluminescence and magnetoconductance and\nthe theoretically calculable singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination\nreaction. This relationship is expected to be valid regardless of the mechanism\nof the magnetoconductance, provided the mobilities of the free polarons are\nindependent of the applied magnetic field (i.e., provided one discounts the\npossibility of spin-dependent transport). We also discuss the semiclassical\ncalculation of the singlet yield of the polaron pair recombination reaction for\nmaterials such as poly(2,5-dioctyloxy-paraphenylene vinylene) (DOO-PPV), the\nhyperfine fields in the polarons of which can be extracted from light-induced\nelectron spin resonance measurements. The resulting theory is shown to give\ngood agreement with experimental data for both normal (H-) and deuterated (D-)\nDOO-PPV over a wide range of magnetic field strengths once singlet-triplet\ndephasing is taken into account. Without this effect, which has not been\nincluded in any previous simulation of magnetoelectroluminescence, it is not\npossible to reproduce the experimental data for both isotopologues in a\nconsistent fashion. Our results also indicate that the magnetoconductance of\nDOO-PPV cannot be solely due to the effect of the magnetic field on the\ndissociation of polaron pairs.\n", "  The basic question is addressed, how the space dimension $d$ is encoded in\nthe Hilbert space of $N$ identical fermions. There appears a finite number\n$N!^{d-1}$ of many-body wave functions, called shapes, which cannot be\ngenerated by trivial combinatorial extension of the one-dimensional ones. A\ngeneral algorithm is given to list them all in terms of standard Slater\ndeterminants. Conversely, excitations which can be induced from the\none-dimensional case are bosonised into a system of distinguishable bosons,\ncalled Euler bosons, much like the electromagnetic field is quantized in terms\nof photons distinguishable by their wave numbers. Their wave functions are\ngiven explicitly in terms of elementary symmetric functions, reflecting the\nfact that the fermion sign problem is trivial in one dimension. The shapes act\nas vacua for the Euler bosons. They are the natural generalization of the\nsingle-Slater-determinant form for the ground state to more than one dimension.\nIn terms of algebraic invariant theory, the shapes are antisymmetric invariants\nwhich finitely generate the $N$-fermion Hilbert space as a graded algebra over\nthe ring of symmetric polynomials. Analogous results hold for identical bosons.\n", "  We present a precise optical and near-infrared determination of the Tip of\nthe Red Giant Branch (TRGB) brightness in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds\n(respectively LMC and SMC). The commonly used calibrations of the absolute\nmagnitude of the TRGB lead to an overestimation of the distance to the LMC and\nSMC in the K band, and an underestimation of the distance in the optical I band\nfor both galaxies. Reported discrepancies are at the level of 0.2 mag, with\nrespect to the very accurate distance determinations to both Clouds based on\nlate-type eclipsing binaries. The differential distances between the LMC and\nSMC obtained in the J and K bands, and for the bolometric brightness are\nconsistent with each other, and with the results obtained from eclipsing\nbinaries and other distance indicators.\n", "  Cadmium arsenide ($\\rm Cd_3As_2$) is known for its inverted band structure\nand ultra-high electron mobility. It has been theoretically predicted and also\nconfirmed by ARPES experiments to exhibit a 3D Dirac semimetal phase containing\ndegenerate Weyl nodes. From magneto-transport measurements in high quality\nsingle crystals of $\\rm Cd_3As_2$, a small effective mass $m^* \\approx$ 0.05\n$m_e$ is determined from the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. In certain\nfield orientations, we find a splitting of the SdH oscillation frequency in the\nFFT spectrum suggesting a possible lifting of the double degeneracy in accord\nwith the helical spin texture at outer and inner Fermi surfaces with opposite\nchirality predicted by our \\textit{ab initio} calculations. Strikingly, a large\nantisymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to the applied magnetic fields is\nuncovered over a wide temperature range in needle crystal of $\\rm Cd_3As_2$\nwith its long axis along [112] crystal direction. It reveals a possible\ncontribution of intrinsic anomalous velocity term in the transport equation\nresulting from a unique 3D Rashba-like spin splitted bands that can be obtained\nfrom band calculations with the inclusion of Cd antisite defects.\n", "  The latest LHC data suggest an intriguing excess at $m_{\\gamma\\gamma} = 750$\nGeV which apparently requires an explanation from the beyond standard model\nphysics. In this note we explore the possibility for this signal to arise from\na top-pion in the Top Triangle Moose model which can be viewed as a\ndimensional-deconstruction version of the top-color assisted technicolor model.\nWe demonstrate that the observed excess can be accommodated by and has\nimportant implications for this interesting model.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic magnetic response of ferromagnetic flexible\nNiFe/Ta and FeCuNbSiB/Ta multilayers under external stress. We explore the\npossibility of handling magnetic anisotropy and dynamic magnetic response of\nflexible magnetostrictive nanostructures. We quantify the sensitivity of the\nmultilayers under external stress by calculating the ratio $|\\Delta\n\\textrm{MI}|/|\\Delta \\bar{\\sigma}|$ and show that considerable values can be\nreached by tuning the magnetic field, frequency, magnetostriction constant, and\nexternal stress. The results reveal possibilities of application of flexible\nmagnetostrictive multilayers under external stress and place them as very\nattractive candidates as element sensor for the development of sensitive smart\ntouch sensors.\n", "  We study a parity-time (PT) symmetric ring lattice, with one pair of balanced\ngain and loss located at opposite positions. The system remains PT-symmetric\nwhen threaded by a magnetic flux; however, the PT symmetry is sensitive to the\nmagnetic flux, in the presence of a large balanced gain and loss, or in a large\nsystem. We find a threshold gain/loss, above which, any nontrivial magnetic\nflux breaks the PT symmetry. We obtain the maximally tolerable magnetic flux\nfor the exact PT-symmetric phase, which is approximately linearly dependent on\na weak gain/loss.\n", "  $Om(z)$ is a diagnostic approach to distinguish dark energy models. However,\nthere are few articles to discuss what is the distinguishing criterion. In this\npaper, firstly we smooth the latest observational $H(z)$ data using a\nmodel-independent method -- Gaussian processes, and then reconstruct the\n$Om(z)$ and its fist order derivative $\\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$. Such\nreconstructions not only could be the distinguishing criteria, but also could\nbe used to estimate the authenticity of models. We choose some popular models\nto study, such as $\\Lambda$CDM, generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model,\nChevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan\n(JBP) parametrization. We plot the trajectories of $Om(z)$ and\n$\\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$ with $1 \\sigma$ confidence level of these models, and\ncompare them to the reconstruction from $H(z)$ data set. The result indicates\nthat the $H(z)$ data does not favor the CPL and JBP models at $1 \\sigma$\nconfidence level. Strangely, in high redshift range, the reconstructed\n$\\mathcal{L}^{(1)}_m$ has a tendency of deviation from theoretical value, which\ndemonstrates these models are disagreeable with high redshift $H(z)$ data. This\nresult supports the conclusions of Sahni et al. \\citep{sahni2014model} and Ding\net al. \\citep{ding2015there} that the $\\Lambda$CDM may not be the best\ndescription of our universe.\n", "  Supermassive black holes in galaxy centres can grow by the accretion of gas,\nliberating energy that might regulate star formation on galaxy-wide scales. The\nnature of the gaseous fuel reservoirs that power black hole growth is\nnevertheless largely unconstrained by observations, and is instead routinely\nsimplified as a smooth, spherical inflow of very hot gas. Recent theory and\nsimulations instead predict that accretion can be dominated by a stochastic,\nclumpy distribution of very cold molecular clouds - a departure from the \"hot\nmode\" accretion model - although unambiguous observational support for this\nprediction remains elusive. Here we report observations that reveal a cold,\nclumpy accretion flow towards a supermassive black hole fuel reservoir in the\nnucleus of the Abell 2597 Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG), a nearby (redshift\nz=0.0821) giant elliptical galaxy surrounded by a dense halo of hot plasma.\nUnder the right conditions, thermal instabilities can precipitate from this hot\ngas, producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's centre,\nsustaining star formation amid a kiloparsec-scale molecular nebula that\ninhabits its core. The observations show that these cold clouds also fuel black\nhole accretion, revealing \"shadows\" cast by the molecular clouds as they move\ninward at about 300 kilometres per second towards the active supermassive black\nhole in the galaxy centre, which serves as a bright backlight. Corroborating\nevidence from prior observations of warmer atomic gas at extremely high spatial\nresolution, along with simple arguments based on geometry and probability,\nindicate that these clouds are within the innermost hundred parsecs of the\nblack hole, and falling closer towards it.\n", "  Based on an exact solution of the Einstein field equations, it is proposed in\nthis note that the dark-matter hypothesis could have led to the prediction of\nflat galactic rotation curves long before the discovery thereof by assuming\nthat on large scales the matter in the Universe, including dark matter, is a\nperfect fluid.\n", "  We can observe the changes of Total Electron Content, TEC, in ionosphere by\nanalyzing the data from GNSS satellites. There are many reports about TEC\nanomalies after earthquakes, i.e. large earthquakes often disturb the\nionosphere. Up to now, preseismic TEC anomalies have been reported in several\npapers. However, they are not so clear as coseismic TEC anomalies, and their\nanalysis methods have some problems for practical earthquake prediction. One\nfactor making it difficult to detect TEC anomalies is large noises in TEC data.\nNon-negligible TEC disturbances are caused by many natural mechanisms. To\novercome this difficulty, we propose correlation analyses between one GNSS\nstation and GNSS stations surrounding it. First, we model TEC time series over\na few hours using polynomial functions of time. Second, we calculate prediction\nerrors as the departure of the TEC time series from the models over time scale\nof a few minutes, and define it as the TEC anomaly. Third, we calculate the\ncorrelation between anomaly of one GNSS station and those at the surrounding\nstations. Although such a correlation method has long been used for radio\ncommunications, in particular for spread spectrum communications and very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) to increase SNR (signal to noise ratio), it has\nnot been widely applied for TEC analyses. As a result of our method, we\ndemonstrate that the correlation analysis let us detect TEC anomaly one hour\nbefore 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. In this paper, we examined the 2011\nTohoku-oki case extensively.\n", "  The GaAs/AlGaAs materials system is well suited to multi-bandgap applications\nsuch as the multiple quantum well solar cell. GaAs quantum wells are inserted\nin the undoped AlGaAs active region of a pin structure to extend the absorption\nrange while retaining a higher open circuit voltage than would be provided by a\ncell made of the well material alone. Unfortunately aluminium gallium arsenide\n(AlGaAs) suffers from poor transport characteristics due to DX centres and\noxygen contamination during growth, which degrade the spectral response. We\ninvestigate three mechanisms for improving the spectral response of the MQW\nsolar cell while an experimental study of the open circuit voltage examines the\nvoltage enhancement. An optimised structure for a high efficiency GaAs/AlGaAs\nsolar cell is proposed.\n", "  The GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well solar cell (QWSC) shows promise as a novel\napproach to higher efficiency solar cells but suffers from a poor short circuit\ncurrent Jsc. We report on efforts to reduce this problem with the use of\ncompositional grading and back surface mirroring. We present experimental\nquantum efficiency (QE) data on a range of compositionally graded QWSCs and\ndevices in which the back surface of the cell is coated with a mirror,\nincreasing the optical thickness of the quantum well layer in the long\nwavelength range. The experimental QE spectra are reproduced by a model which\ndeals with arbitrary compositional profiles and optical cavities formed in the\nmirrored cells. The model is used to design an optimised QWSC, and projected\nJsc values given. Applications including II-VI and tandem solar cells are\nconsidered.\n", "  A methodology is presented here for deriving true experimental axial\nstress-strain curves in both tension and compression for monolayer graphene\nthrough the shift of the 2D Raman peak that is present in all graphitic\nmaterials. The principle behind this approach is the observation that the shift\nof the 2D wavenumber as a function of strain for different types of PAN based\nfibres is a linear function of their Young's moduli and, hence, the\ncorresponding value of the shift of the 2D Raman peak over axial stress is, in\nfact, a constant. By moving across the length scales we show that this value is\nalso valid at the nanoscale as it corresponds to the in plane breathing mode of\ngraphene that is present in both PAN based fibres and monolayer graphene.\nHence, the values of the shift of the 2D Raman peak can be easily converted to\nvalues of stress in the linear elastic region without the aid of modelling or\nthe need to resort to cumbersome experimental procedures for obtaining the\naxial force transmitted to the material and the cross sectional area of the two\ndimensional membrane.\n", "  Imaging geological structures through cosmic muon radiography is a newly\ndeveloped technique particularly interesting in volcanology. Here we show that\nmuon radiography may be efficient to detect and characterize mass movements in\nshallow hydrothermal systems of low-energy active volcanoes like the La\nSoufri\\`ere lava dome. We present an experiment conducted on this volcano\nduring the Summer $2014$ and bring evidence that huge density changes occurred\nin three domains of the lava dome. Depending on their position and on the\nmedium porosity the volumes of these domains vary from $1 \\times 10^6 \\;\n\\mathrm{m}^3$ to $7 \\times 10^6 \\; \\mathrm{m}^3$. However, the mass changes\nremain quite constant, two of them being negative ($\\Delta m \\approx -0.6\n\\times 10^9 \\; \\mathrm{kg}$) and a third one being positive ($\\Delta m \\approx\n+2 \\times 10^9 \\; \\mathrm{kg}$). We attribute the negative mass changes to the\nformation of steam in shallow hydrothermal reservoir previously partly filled\nwith liquid water. This coincides with the apparition of new fumaroles on top\nof the volcano. The positive mass change is synchronized with the negative mass\nchanges indicating that liquid water probably flowed from the two reservoirs\ninvaded by steam toward the third reservoir.\n", "  An infinite class of exact static anisotropic spheres is developed. All\nmembers of the class satisfy (i) regularity (meaning no singularities), and in\nparticular at the origin, (ii) positive but monotone decreasing energy density\n($\\rho(r)$), radial pressure ($p(r)$), and tangential pressure ($P(r)$), (iii)\na finite value of $r=R$ such that $p(R)=0$ defining the boundary surface onto\nvacuum, (iv) $p \\leq \\rho$, and (v) $p + 2 P=3 \\rho$. All standard energy\nconditions are satisfied except for the dominant energy condition which has an\ninnocuous violation by the tangential stress since $\\rho \\leq P$ by\nconstruction. An infinite number of the solutions violate the Buchdal bound.\n", "  This article illustrates the possibility of investigating mass hierarchy and\nCP-violating phase \\delta^{CP}, in the context of CP trajectory diagrams in the\nbi-probability plane. Separation between normal mass hierarchy (NH) and\ninverted mass hierarchy (IH) CP trajectory ellipses in the P-P^T plane seems to\nbe very promising in order to investigate mass hierarchy. Illustration of\nseparation between two hierarchy ellipses in the E-L plane is very helping to\ncover all the desired base lines and beam energies and also to analyze benefits\nand drawbacks at single place. If we know the mass hierarchy, then from the\nlarge sizes of CP trajectory ellipse which is possible at appropriately long\nbase line (L) and at specific value of beam energy (E), it becomes possible to\ninvestigate at-least narrow ranges of CP/T-violating phase \\delta^{CP}. The\nPossibility of more than one set of (\\theta_{13}; \\delta^{CP}) parameters to\ncorrespond to any chosen coordinate in P-P^T plane, known as parameter\ndegeneracy, may hinder exact determination of mass hierarchy as well as\n\\delta^{CP} value. To circumvent this degeneracy in the (\\theta_{13};\n\\delta^{CP}) parameter space, in case of opposite sign solutions corresponding\nto NH and IH case points toward the need of sufficiently long base lines, so as\nto separate opposite hierarchy ellipses to observable separation, and in case\nof same sign solutions corresponding to either NH or IH, we need to choose an\nexperimental configuration with L = 2,535 Km, E = 5 GeV for n=1 scenario.\n", "  We study relativistic scattering when one only has access to a subset of the\nparticles, using the language of quantum measurement theory. We give an exact,\nnon-perturbative formula for the von Neumann entanglement entropy of an\napparatus particle scattered off an arbitrary set of system particles, in\neither the elastic or inelastic regime, and show how to evaluate it\nperturbatively. We give general formulas for the late-time expectation values\nof apparatus observables. Some simple example applications are included: in\nparticular, a protocol to verify preparation of coherent superpositions of\nspatially localized system states using position-space information in the\noutgoing apparatus state, at lowest order in perturbation theory in a weak\napparatus-system coupling.\n", "  Star formation is inefficient. Only a few percent of the available gas in\nmolecular clouds forms stars, leading to the observed low star formation rate\n(SFR). The same holds when averaged over many molecular clouds, such that the\nSFR of whole galaxies is again surprisingly low. Indeed, considering the low\ntemperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and\ncollapse on their global mean freefall timescale. And yet, they are observed to\nlive about 10-100 times longer, i.e., the SFR per freefall time is only a few\npercent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must provide support against quick\nglobal collapse. Magnetic fields, turbulence and stellar feedback have been\nproposed as stabilising agents controlling star formation, but it is still\nunclear which of these processes is the most important and what their relative\ncontributions are. Here I present high-resolution, adaptive-mesh-refinement\nsimulations of star cluster formation that include turbulence, magnetic fields,\nand protostellar jet/outflow feedback. These simulations produce nearly\nrealistic star formation rates consistent with observations, but only if\nturbulence, magnetic fields and feedback are included simultaneously.\n", "  Two new ternary borides $TM$$_7$Fe$_3$B$_8$ ($TM$ = Nb, Ta) were synthesized\nby high-temperature thermal treatment of samples obtained by arc-melting. This\nnew type of structure with space group $P$6/$mmm$, comprises $TM$ slabs\ncontaining isolated planar hexagonal [B$_6$] rings and iron centered $TM$\ncolumns in a Kagome type of arrangement. Chemical bonding analysis in\nNb$_7$Fe$_3$B$_8$ by means of the electron localizability approach reveals\ntwo-center interactions forming the Kagome net of Fe and embedded B, while\nweaker multicenter bonding present between this net and Nb atoms. Magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements reveal antiferromagnetic order below $T_N$ = 240 K\nfor Nb$_7$Fe$_3$B$_8$ and $T_N$ =265 K for Ta$_7$Fe$_3$B$_8$. Small remnant\nmagnetization below 0.01 $\\mu_B$/f.u. is observed in the antiferromagnetic\nstate. The bulk nature of the magnetic transitions was confirmed by the\nhyperfine splitting of the M\\\"o{\\ss}bauer spectra, the sizable anomalies in the\nspecific heat capacity, and the kinks in the resistivity curves. The high-field\nparamagnetic susceptibilities fitted by the Curie-Weiss law show effective\nparamagnetic moments $\\mu_{eff}$ about 3.1 $\\mu_B$/Fe in both compounds. The\ntemperature dependence of the electrical resistivity also reveals metallic\ncharacter of both compounds. Density functional calculations corroborate the\nmetallic behaviour of both compounds and demonstrate the formation of a sizable\nlocal magnetic moment on the Fe-sites. They indicate the presence of both\nantiferro- and ferromagnetic interactions.\n", "  As well known that it is no way to do the abstract harmonic analysis on the\nnon connected Lie groups. The goal of this paper is to draw the attention of\nMathematicians to solve this problem. therefore let R be the group of nonzero\nreal numbers with multiplication and let H be the 3-dimensional Heisenberg\ngroup. I denote by G the semi direct of the Heisenberg group with R3 which is\nnon connected solvable Lie group, and isomorphic onto the 6- dimensional non\nsingular triangular matrix Lie group. I define the Fourier-Mellin transform and\nestablish the Plancherel theorem on the group G. Besides I prove the\nsolvability of any non zero invariant differential operator on the identity\ncomponent of the group G. Finally, I give a classification of all left ideals\nof the its group algebra\n", "  We present a design for a tunneling-current-assisted scanning near-field\nmicrowave microscope. For stable operation at cryogenic temperatures, making a\nsmall and rigid microwave probe is important. Our coaxial resonator probe has a\nlength of approxomately 30 mm and can fit inside the 2-inch bore of a\nsuperconducting magnet. The probe design includes an insulating joint, which\nseparates DC and microwave signals without degrading the quality factor. By\napplying the SMM to the imaging of an electrically inhomogeneous\nsuperconductor, we obtain the spatial distribution of the microwave response\nwith a spatial resolution of approximately 200 nm. Furthermore, we present an\nanalysis of our SMM probe based on a simple lumped-element circuit model along\nwith the near-field microwave measurements of silicon wafers having different\nconductivities.\n", "  We study the relation between a threshold-force based model at the\nmicroscopic scale and mode I fracture at the macroscopic scale in a system of\ndiscrete interacting springs. Specifically, we idealize the contact between two\nsurfaces as that between a rigid surface and a collection of springs with\nlong-range interaction and a constant tensile threshold force. We show that a\nparticular scaling similar to that of crack-tip stress in Linear Elastic\nFracture Mechanics leads to a macroscopic limit behavior. The model also\nreproduces the scaling behaviors of the JKR model of adhesive contact. We\ndetermine how the threshold force depends on the fracture energy and elastic\nproperties of the material. The model can be used to study rough-surface\nadhesion.\n", "  It is mathematically proven that, if the stability matrix $\\mathsf{S}$ is\npositive-semidefinite, solutions of the random-phase approximation (RPA)\nequation are all physical or belong to Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes, and the\nNG-mode solutions may form Jordan blocks of $\\mathsf{N\\,S}$ ($\\mathsf{N}$ is\nthe norm matrix) but their dimension is not more than two. This guarantees that\nthe NG modes in the RPA can be separated out via canonically conjugate\nvariables.\n", "  Spatio-temporal evolution of the relativistic Buneman instability has been\ninvestigated in one dimension using an in-house developed particle-in-cell\nsimulation code. Starting from the excitation of the instability, its evolution\nhas been followed numerically till its quenching and beyond. As compared to the\nwell understood non-relativistic case, it is found that the maximum growth rate\n($\\gamma_{max}$) reduces due to relativistic effects and varies with\n$\\gamma_{e0}$ and m/M as $\\gamma_{max} \\sim\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2\\sqrt{\\gamma_{e0}}}\\biglb(\\frac{m}{2M}\\bigrb)^{1/3}$, where\n$\\gamma_{e0}$ is Lorentz factor associated with the initial electron drift\nvelocity ($v_{0}$) and (m/M) is the electron to ion mass ratio. Further it is\nobserved that in contrast to the non-relativistic results[Hirose,Plasma Phys.\n20, 481(1978)] at the saturation point, ratio of electrostatic field energy\ndensity ($\\sum\\limits_{k} |E_{k}|^{2}/8\\pi$) to initial drift kinetic energy\ndensity ($W_{0}$) scales with $\\gamma_{e0}$ as $\\sim 1/\\gamma^{2}_{e0}$. These\nsimulation results are found to be in good agreement with that derived using\nfluid theory.\n", "  The purpose of this study was to present image reconstruction methods for\nmagnetic particle imaging (MPI) with a field-free-line (FFL) encoding scheme\nand to propose the use of the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization\n(ML-EM) algorithm for improving the image quality of MPI. The feasibility of\nthese methods was investigated by computer simulations, in which the projection\ndata were generated by summing up the Fourier harmonics obtained from the MPI\nsignals based on the Langevin function. Images were reconstructed from the\ngenerated projection data using the filtered backprojection (FBP) method and\nthe ML-EM algorithm. The effects of the gradient of selection magnetic field\n(SMF), the strength of drive magnetic field (DMF), the diameter of magnetic\nnanoparticles (MNPs), and the number of projection data on the image quality of\nthe reconstructed images were investigated. The spatial resolution of the\nreconstructed images became better with increasing gradient of SMF and with\nincreasing diameter of MNPs up to approximately 30 nm. For the diameter greater\nthan approximately 30 nm, the spatial resolution was almost constant. It also\nbecame better with decreasing strength of DMF. The image quality was improved\nby use of the ML-EM algorithm compared to the FBP method, especially when the\nstrength of DMF was weak and the number of projection data was small. In\nconclusion, we presented image reconstruction methods for MPI with an FFL\nencoding scheme and our preliminary results suggest that the ML-EM algorithm\nwill be useful for improving the image quality of MPI.\n", "  Sensing technologies have been under research and development for their\nvaried applications from microelectronics to space exploration. With the end of\nMoores law in sight, there is growing demand for shrinking materials and\nimproving sensitivity and range of sensing of sensors. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)\noffer an excellent combination of small size (in the order of nanometers in two\ndimensions and micrometers in the third dimension), varied current conductivity\n(from insulating to metallic), flexibility, mechanical strength and feasibility\nof mass production. Here we used CNTs to fabricate pressure sensors to sense\nstatic loads of pressure and studied the characteristics of different methods\nof building the sensors. We offer an adhesive-absorption technique of\nfabrication of pressure sensors that tackles the issue of endurance of the\nsensors to repeated operation. We demonstrate a significant change in\nresistance of a vertically aligned forest of nanotubes upon application of\nstatic loads. This study will enable building of better pressure sensors for\nseveral applications.\n", "  We consider a problem of mass points interacting gravitationally whose motion\nis subjected to certain holonomic constraints. The motion of points is\nrestricted to certain curves and surfaces. We illustrate the complicated\nbehaviour of trajectories of these systems using Poincar\\'e cross sections. For\nsome models we prove the non-integrability analysing properties of the\ndifferential Galois group of variational equations along certain particular\nsolutions of considered systems. Also some integrable cases are identified.\n", "  Concept of high efficiency photon storage based on adiabatic confinement\nbetween concave mirrors is presented and experimentally investigated. The\napproach is insensitive to typical for Fabri-Perot cells requirements on\nquality of accumulated radiation, tolerance of resonator elements and their\nstability. Experiments have been carried out with the trap, which consists from\nopposed concave cylindrical mirrors and conjugated with them spherical mirrors.\nIn result, high efficiency for accumulation of radiation with large angular\nspread and spectrum width has been confirmed. As radiation source a commercial\nfiber laser has been used.\n", "  The need to interpret ultraviolet photoemission data strongly motivates the\nrefinement of first-principles techniques able to accurately predict spectral\nproperties. In this work we employ Koopmans-compliant functionals, constructed\nto enforce piecewise linearity in approximate density functionals, to calculate\nthe structural and electronic properties of DNA and RNA nucleobases. Our\nresults show that not only ionization potentials and electron affinities are\naccurately predicted with mean absolute errors < 0.1 eV, but also that\ncalculated photoemission spectra are in excellent agreement with experimental\nultraviolet photoemission spectra. In particular, the role and contribution of\ndifferent tautomers to the photoemission spectra are highlighted and discussed\nin detail. The structural properties of nucleobases are also investigated,\nshowing an improved description with respect to local and semilocal\ndensity-functional theory. Methodologically, our results further consolidate\nthe role of Koopmans-compliant functionals in providing, through\norbital-density-dependent potentials, accurate electronic and spectral\nproperties.\n", "  An approach based on splitting the reaction potential into a finite range\npart and a long range tail part to describe few-body scattering in the case of\na Coulombic interaction is proposed. The solution to the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nfor the long range tail of the reaction potential is used as an incoming wave.\nThis reformulation of the scattering problem into an inhomogeneous\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with asymptotic outgoing waves makes it suitable for\nsolving with the exterior complex scaling technique. The validity of the\napproach is analyzed from a formal point of view and demonstrated numerically,\nwhere the calculations are performed with the finite element method. The method\nof splitting the potential in this way is illustrated with calculations of the\nelectron scattering on the hydrogen atom and the positive helium ion in energy\nregions where resonances appear.\n", "  Developing neutrino astronomy requires a good understanding of the neutrino\noscillations mechanism. The European strategy for neutrino oscillation physics\nsets a high priority on future long baseline neutrino experiments with the aim\nto measure the intrinsic parameters that govern the neutrino oscillations. In\nthis work we take a look at the next generation of long baseline experiments\nand discuss their prospects in future research.\n", "  A study on temperature dependent magnetic properties of single phase\northorhombic perovskites system associated with space group Pbnm compounds\nPr1-x(Gd/Nd)xMnO3 (x=0.3, 0.5, 0.7) was carried out. A magnetization reversal\nis observed below the Neel temperature (TN), in DC magnetization measurements\n(at 50 Oe) in the doped compounds. This may be due to the antiparallel coupling\nbetween the two magnetic sublattices (|Pr+Gd/Nd | and Mn). With lowering of\ntemperature, the |Pr+ Gd/Nd|) ions begin to polarize under the negative\ninternal field due to canted moment of Mn moments. The hysteresis plot taken at\n50K shows a ferrimagnetic characteristic and the presence of spin canting of\nions in the magnetic sublattices. Arrott plot indicates field induced second\norder paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic (PM-FiM) phase transition in this system.\n", "  Grain growth during star formation affects the physical and chemical\nprocesses in the evolution of star-forming clouds. We investigate the origin of\nthe millimeter (mm)-sized grains recently observed in Class I protostellar\nenvelopes. We use the coagulation model developed in our previous paper and\nfind that a hydrogen number density of as high as $10^{10}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$,\ninstead of the typical density $10^5~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$, is necessary for the\nformation of mm-sized grains. Thus, we test a hypothesis that such large grains\nare transported to the envelope from the inner, denser parts, finding that gas\ndrag by outflow efficiently \"launches\" the large grains as long as the central\nobject has not grown to $\\gtrsim 0.1$ M$_{\\odot}$. By investigating the\nshattering effect on the mm-sized grains, we ensure that the large grains are\nnot significantly fragmented after being injected in the envelope. We conclude\nthat the mm-sized grains observed in the protostellar envelopes are not formed\nin the envelopes but formed in the inner parts of the star-forming regions and\ntransported to the envelopes before a significant mass growth of the central\nobject, and that they survive in the envelopes.\n", "  We give a manifestly invariant definition of the Lagrangian complex germ with\nthe minimal degree of accuracy required to define the canonical operator. The\nequivalence with the traditional definition is proved, and the canonical\noperator is constructed in new terms. A new form of the quantization condition\nis given, in which the volume form is assumed to be defined on the universal\ncovering of the Lagrangian manifold rather than on the manifold itself. This\nallows one to solve a wider class of eigenvalue problems.\n", "  We examine properties of small-radius jets, focusing on phenomenological\napplications to the inclusive jet spectrum. We match fixed-order calculations\nwith the leading-logarithmic resummation of the jet radius (LL$_R$), and\npropose a new prescription to evaluate theoretical uncertainties for\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) predictions. We also examine the $R$-dependent\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections, and include them in our\ncalculation. We discuss hadronisation corrections, which are derived from Monte\nCarlo generators. Finally, we assemble these elements and compare the ratio of\nthe inclusive jet spectra at two $R$ values obtained from our matched\n(N)NLO+LL$_R$ predictions to data from ALICE and ATLAS, finding improved\nagreement.\n", "  Many, if not all, galaxies host massive compact objects at their centers.\nThey are present as singularities (super massive black holes) or high density\nstar clusters (nuclear tar clusters). In some cases they coexist, and interact\nmore or less strongly. In this short paper I will talk of the 'merger' globular\ncluster scenario, which has been shown in the past to be an explanation of the\nsubstantial mass accumulation in galactic centers. In particular, I will\npresent the many astrophysical implications of such scenario pointing the\nattention on the mutual feedback of orbitally decaying globular clusters with\nmassive and super massive black holes.\n", "  Individual dislocations in an ultra-pure GaAs epilayer are investigated with\nspatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging at 5~K. We find\nthat some dislocations act as strong non-radiative recombination centers, while\nothers are efficient radiative recombination centers. We characterize\nluminescence bands in GaAs due to dislocations, stacking faults, and pairs of\nstacking faults. These results indicate that low-temperature,\nspatially-resolved photoluminescence imaging can be a powerful tool for\nidentifying luminescence bands of extended defects. This mapping could then be\nused to identify extended defects in other GaAs samples solely based on\nlow-temperature photoluminescence spectra.\n", "  The mixture/interaction of anti-sunward-propagating Alfv\\'enic fluctuations\n(AFs) and sunward-propagating Alfv\\'enic fluctuations (SAFs) is believed to\nresult in the decrease of the Alfv\\'enicity of solar wind fluctuations with\nincreasing heliocentric distance. However, SAFs are rarely observed at 1 au and\nsolar wind AFs are found to be generally outward. Using the measurements from\nVoyager 2 and Wind, we perform a statistical survey of SAFs in the heliosphere\ninside 6 au. We first report two SAF events observed by Voyager 2. One is in\nthe anti-sunward magnetic sector with a strong positive correlation between the\nfluctuations of magnetic field and solar wind velocity. The other one is in the\nsunward magnetic sector with a strong negative magnetic field-velocity\ncorrelation. Statistically, the percentage of SAFs increases gradually with\nheliocentric distance, from about 2.7% at 1.0 au to about 8.7% at 5.5 au. These\nresults provide new clues for understanding the generation mechanism of SAFs.\n", "  We consider the asymmetric active coupler (AAC) consisting of two coupled\ndissimilar waveguides with gain and loss. We show that under generic\nconditions, not restricted by parity-time symmetry, there exist finite-power,\nconstant-intensity nonlinear supermodes (NS), resulting from the balance\nbetween gain, loss, nonlinearity, coupling and dissimilarity. The system is\nshown to possess nonreciprocal dynamics enabling directed power transport and\noptical isolation functionality.\n", "  Photodetectors are typically based on photocurrent generation from\nelectron-hole pairs in semiconductor structures and on bolometry for\nwavelengths that are below bandgap absorption. In both cases, resonant\nplasmonic and nanophotonic structures have been successfully used to enhance\nperformance. In this work, we demonstrate subwavelength thermoelectric\nnanostructures designed for resonant spectrally selective absorption, which\ncreates large enough localized temperature gradients to generate easily\nmeasureable thermoelectric voltages. We show that such structures are tunable\nand are capable of highly wavelength specific detection, with an input power\nresponsivity of up to 119 V/W (referenced to incident illumination), and\nresponse times of nearly 3 kHz, by combining resonant absorption and\nthermoelectric junctions within a single structure, yielding a\nbandgap-independent photodetection mechanism. We report results for both\nresonant nanophotonic bismuth telluride-antimony telluride structures and\nchromel-alumel structures as examples of a broad class of nanophotonic\nthermoelectric structures useful for fast, low-cost and robust optoelectronic\napplications such as non-bandgap-limited hyperspectral and broad-band\nphotodetectors.\n", "  Inspired by the relation between the algebra of complex numbers and plane\ngeometry, William Rowan Hamilton sought an algebra of triples for application\nto three dimensional geometry. Unable to multiply and divide triples, he\ninvented a non-commutative division algebra of quadruples, in what he\nconsidered his most significant work, generalizing the real and complex number\nsystems. We give a motivated introduction to quaternions and discuss how they\nare related to Pauli matrices, rotations in three dimensions, the three sphere,\nthe group SU(2) and the celebrated Hopf fibrations.\n", "  AR Herculis is an RR Lyrae star of type RRab whose spectral type ranges from\nA7 to F3. Its visual brightness varies between 10.59 mag and 11.63 mag (V). By\nanalysis of 34,000 measurements from the AAVSO International Database and\nadditional data from the BAV, 116 times of maximum between 2003 and 2015 were\nderived. For the time span 2009 to 2015, a new period value of P =\n0.46999746(145) days was derived from the (O-C) analysis. Furthermore, the\nderived maximum timings indicate a strong Blazhko effect with a Blazhko period\nof PB = 32.062(13) days. The evolution of the observed maximum brightness Vmax,\nwhich decreased from 2009 to 2015 by 22 mmag/year, is also indicative of a\nBlazhko effect with PB = 29.528(17) d. The present work investigates the\nprocesses in the frequently used (O-C) vs. Vmax diagram by running several\nsimulations based on assumed and observational data.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of near horizon near extremal Kerr (NHNEK)\ngeometry within the framework of $AdS_2/CFT_1$ correspondence. We start by\nshifting the horizon of near horizon extremal Kerr (NHEK) geometry by a general\nfinite mass. While this shift does not alter the geometry in that the resulting\nclassical solution is still diffeomorphic to the NHEK solution, it does lead to\na quantum theory different from that of NHEK. We obtain this quantum theory by\nmeans of a Robinson-Wilczek two-dimensional Kaluza-Klein reduction which\nenables us to introduce a finite regulator on the $AdS_2$ boundary and compute\nthe full asymptotic symmetry group of the two-dimensional quantum conformal\nfield theory on the respective $AdS_2$ boundary. The s-wave contribution of the\nenergy-momentum-tensor of this conformal field theory, together with the\nasymptotic symmetries, generate a Virasoro algebra with a calculable center,\nwhich agrees with the standard Kerr/$CFT$ result, and a non-vanishing lowest\nVirasoro eigenmode. The central charge and lowest eigenmode produce the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy and Hawking temperature for NHNEK.\n", "  The mass spectrum of stellar black holes (BHs) is highly uncertain.\nTheoretical models of BH formation strongly depend on the efficiency of stellar\nwinds of the progenitor star and on the supernova (SN) explosion mechanism. We\ndiscuss the BH mass spectrum we obtain using SEVN, a new public\npopulation-synthesis code that includes up-to-date stellar-wind prescriptions\nand several SN explosion models. Our models indicate a sub-solar metallicity\nenvironment for the progenitors of the gravitational wave source GW150914. We\nshow that our models predict substantially larger BH masses (up to ~100 Msun)\nthan other population synthesis codes, at low metallicity. In this proceeding,\nwe also discuss the impact of pair-instability SNe on our previously published\nmodels.\n", "  The runaway merger scenario is one of the most promising mechanisms to\nexplain the formation of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in young dense\nstar clusters (SCs). On the other hand, the massive stars that participate in\nthe runaway merger lose mass by stellar winds. This effect is tremendously\nimportant, especially at high metallicity. We discuss N-body simulations of\nmassive (~6x10^4 Msun) SCs, in which we added new recipes for stellar winds and\nsupernova explosion at different metallicity. At solar metallicity, the mass of\nthe final merger product spans from few solar masses up to ~30 Msun. At low\nmetallicity (0.01-0.1 Zsun) the maximum remnant mass is ~250 Msun, in the range\nof IMBHs. A large fraction (~0.6) of the massive remnants are not ejected from\nthe parent SC and acquire stellar or black hole companions. Finally, I discuss\nthe importance of this result for gravitational wave detection.\n", "  We present results from two suites of simulations of powerful radio galaxies\nin poor cluster environments, with a focus on the formation and evolution of\nthe radio lobes. One suite of models uses relativistic hydrodynamics and the\nother relativistic magnetohydrodynamics; both are set up to cover a range of\njet powers and velocities. The dynamics of the lobes are shown to be in good\nagreement with analytical models and with previous numerical models, confirming\nin the relativistic regime that the observed widths of radio lobes may be\nexplained if they are driven by very light jets. The ratio of energy stored in\nthe radio lobes to that put into the intracluster gas is seen to be the same\nregardless of jet power, jet velocity or simulation type, suggesting that we\nhave a robust understanding of the work done on the ambient gas by this type of\nradio source. For the most powerful jets we at times find magnetic field\namplification by up to a factor of two in energy, but mostly the magnetic\nenergy in the lobes is consistent with the magnetic energy injected. We confirm\nour earlier result that for jets with a toroidally injected magnetic field, the\nfield in the lobes is predominantly aligned with the jet axis once the lobes\nare well developed, and that this leads to radio flux anisotropies of up to a\nfactor of about two for mature sources. We reproduce the relationship between\n151-MHz luminosity and jet power determined analytically in the literature.\n", "  The paper deals with jump generators with a convolution kernel. Assuming that\nthe kernel decays either exponentially or polynomially we prove a number of\nlower and upper bounds for the resolvent of such operators. We consider two\napplications of these results. First we obtain pointwise estimates for\nprincipal eigenfunction of jump generators perturbed by a compactly supported\npotential (so-called nonlocal Schr\\\"odinger operators). Then we consider the\nCauchy problem for the corresponding inhomogeneous evolution equations and\nstudy the behaviour of its solutions.\n", "  Many products and innovations become well-known and widely adopted through\nthe social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion\nmodel has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such\nsocial systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional\nto the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or\nhomogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global\ninteractions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,\nindividuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To\nquantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with\nlimited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the\nlikelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of\nadopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the\nentire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is\na random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of\nadopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential\nequation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When\nthe degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly\nfrom the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the\nadoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the\nadoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such\nasymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.\nFinally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,\nlogarithmic in the population size.\n", "  I construct a quantum field theory model with discrete scale invariance at\ntree level. The model has some unusual mathematical properties (such as the\nappearance of $q$-hypergeometric series) and may possibly have some interesting\nphysical properties as well. In this note, I explore some possible physics that\ncould be regarded as a violation of standard effective field theory ideas.\n", "  The rapid growth of the solar energy industry has produced a strong demand\nfor high performance, efficient photoelectric materials. Many ferroelectrics,\ncomposed of earth-abundant elements, are useful for solar cell applications due\nto their large internal polarization. However, their wide band gaps prevent\nthem from absorbing light in the visible to mid-infrared range. Here, we\naddress the band gap issue by investigating, in particular, the substitution of\nsulphur for oxygen in the perovskite structure ZnSnO3 . Using evolutionary\nmethods we identify the stable and metastable structures of ZnSnS3 and compare\nthem to those previously characterized for ZnSnO3 . Our results suggest that\nZnSnS3 forms a monoclinic structure followed by metastable ilmenite and\nlithium-niobate structures. The latter structure is highly polarized and it\npossesses a significantly reduced band gap of 1.28 eV. These desirable\ncharacteristics make it a prime candidate for solar cell applications.\n", "  We consider acceleration-assisted entanglement harvesting as evidenced in\ncorrelations between two accelerating Unruh detectors coupled to a scalar\nfield. We elaborate on earlier studies, which in a stationary phase\napproximation calculated the entanglement dependence on two parameters $c_1 =\n\\kappa L$, and $c_2 = \\kappa \\Omega \\sigma^2$, where $\\kappa$ describes the\ndetector's acceleration, $L$ their separation and $\\Omega$ the energy splitting\nin a pair of two state Unruh detectors. Here, we go beyond the stationary phase\napproximation by performing a numerical calculation of entanglement harvesting,\nallowing us to present the dependence on $c_3 = \\sigma \\Omega$, where $\\sigma$\ndenotes the half width of a Gaussian window function specifying the\nfield-detector interaction, and show agreement with earlier work the large\n$c_3$ limit.\n", "  We report first-principles calculations, within density functional theory, on\nthe lead halide compounds PbCl2, PbBr2, and CH3NH3PbBr3-xClx, taking into\naccount spin-orbit coupling. We show that, when the modified Becke-Johnson\nexchange potential is used with a suitable choice of defining parameters,\nexcellent agreement between calculations and experiment is obtained. The\ncomputational model is then used to study the effect of replacing the\nmethylammonium cation in CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3 with either N2H+5 or N2H+3,\nwhich have slightly smaller ionic radii than methylammonium. We predict that a\nconsiderable downshift in the values of the band gaps occurs with this\nreplacement. The resulting compounds would extend optical absorption down to\nthe near-infrared region, creating excellent light harvesters for solar cells.\n", "  The project \"Complexities and networks in the Medieval Mediterranean and Near\nEast\" (COMMED) at the Division for Byzantine Research of the Institute for\nMedieval Research (IMAFO) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences focuses on the\nadaptation and development of concepts and tools of network theory and\ncomplexity sciences for the analysis of societies, polities and regions in the\nmedieval world in a comparative perspective. Key elements of its methodological\nand technological toolkit are applied, for instance, in the new project\n\"Mapping medieval conflicts: a digital approach towards political dynamics in\nthe pre-modern period\" (MEDCON), which analyses political networks and conflict\namong power elites across medieval Europe with five case studies from the 12th\nto 15th century. For one of these case studies on 14th century Byzantium, the\nexplanatory value of this approach is presented in greater detail. The\npresented results are integrated in a wider comparison of five late medieval\npolities across Afro-Eurasia (Byzantium, China, England, Hungary and Mamluk\nEgypt) against the background of the {\\guillemotright}Late Medieval\nCrisis{\\guillemotleft} and its political and environmental turmoil. Finally,\nfurther perspectives of COMMED are outlined.\n", "  In this paper, the impact of holding umbrella on the uni- and bi-directional\nflow has been investigated via experiment and modeling. In the experiments,\npedestrians are required to walk clockwise/anti-clockwise in a ring-shaped\ncorridor under normal situation and holding umbrella situation. No matter in\nuni- or bi-directional flow, the flow rate under holding umbrella situation\ndecreases comparing with that in normal situation. In bidirectional flow,\npedestrians segregate into two opposite moving streams very quickly under\nnormal situation, and clockwise/anti-clockwise walking pedestrians are always\nin the inner/outer lane due to right-walking preference. Under holding umbrella\nsituation, spontaneous lane formation has also occurred. However, when holding\numbrella, pedestrians may separate into more than two lanes. Moreover, the\nmerge of lanes have been observed, and clockwise/anti-clockwise pedestrians are\nnot always in the inner/outer lane. To model the flow dynamics, an improved\nforce-based model has been proposed. The contact force between umbrellas has\nbeen taken into account. Simulation results are in agreement with the\nexperimental ones.\n", "  Dielectric is considered in the electric field that has equal to zero the\nfirst moment and different from zero the second moment of strength in an\nequilibrium. The equations of ideal hydrodynamics are obtained in such a field\nfor the case of the neglect of dissipative effects. A new variable - the second\nmoment of electric field strength is included in the Euler equation. A temporal\nequation for this variable is obtained on the basis of Maxwell equations in the\nhydrodynamic approximation. Adiabatic one-dimensional waves of small amplitude\nare studied in this system. Proceeding from the theoretical estimation of the\nintracrystalline field in an ionic crystal the good consent of the obtained\nnumerical values of transversal velocity of this wave with transversal velocity\nof sound for isotropic crystals of alkali halides is found.\n", "  ROTSE1 J164341.65+251748.1 was photometrically observed in the V band during\nthree epochs with the 0.84-m telescope of the San Pedro M\\'artir Observatory in\nMexico. Based on additional BVR photometry, we find that the primary star has a\nspectral type around G0V. The light curve of the system is typical of a W~UMa\ntype binary stars and has an orbital period of $\\sim$ 0.323 days. In an effort\nto gain a better understanding of the binary system and determine its physical\nproperties, we analyzed the light curve with the Wilson and Devinney method. We\nfound that ROTSE1 J164341.65+251748.1 has a mass ratio of $\\sim$ 0.34 and that\nthe less massive component is over 230 K hotter than the primary star. The\ninclination of the system is $\\sim$ 84.6 degrees, and the {\\bf degree} of\nover-contact is 11\\%. The analysis shows the presence of variable bright spots\non the primary star.\n", "  A small dipole oscillator moving along a circular trajectory in zero-point\nelectromagnetic field ( ZPF ) and with a polarization normal to the rotation\nplane, is considered. Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF,\nassociated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar\nto spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in\nZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a\nconsequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The\naverage centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this\nmodified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in\nterms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After\nrenormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction\nof a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations\nare carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial\ncomponent of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non\nrelativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency,\nthe force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result\ncould mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains\nits average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the\nestimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not\nobservable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been\nmuch smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical\napproach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected\nresult and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the\nquark world governed by non abelian colored fields, subject of the next paper.\n", "  We develop a chip-scale cavity optomechanical system in single-crystal\nlithium niobate that exhibits high optical quality factors and a large\nfrequency-quality product as high as $3.6\\times 10^{12}$ Hz at room temperature\nand atmosphere. The excellent optical and mechanical properties together with\nthe strong optomechanical coupling allow us to efficiently excite the coherent\nregenerative optomechanical oscillation operating at 375.8 MHz with a threshold\npower of 174 ${\\rm \\mu W}$ in the air. The demonstrated lithium niobate\noptomechanical device enables great potential for achieving\nelectro-optic-mechanical hybrid systems for broad applications in sensing,\nmetrology, and quantum physics.\n", "  The standard second-order pseudo-oscillator potential used in many analytical\ninvestigations of the properties of ions stored in a Paul trap has serious\nlimitations. In this paper we show that ion-crystal configurations exhibited by\n2, 3, and 4 simultaneously stored ions in a Paul trap are not predicted by the\nstandard pseudo-oscillator potential, but are all captured qualitatively and\nquantitatively by an extended pseudopotential derived in this paper. The power\nof our extended pseudopotential extends in particular to the prediction of the\nborder lines between different crystal configurations (morphologies) in the\nPaul trap's $a$, $q$ stability diagram. In the three- and four-ion cases,\nseveral of the ion-crystal structures predicted by our improved pseudopotential\nhave never been observed experimentally before. We present them here as a\nchallenge for experiments.\n", "  Motivated by the precision attained by SQUID devices in measuring magnetic\nfields, we study in this article the thermodynamic behaviour of a fermion gas\nin two and three dimen\\-sional spatial space with noncommutative coordinates\nand momenta. An explicit expression, both for Landau's diamagnetism and Pauli's\nparamagnetism, is obtained for the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of\nthe gas in two and three spatial dimensions. These results show that an upper\nbound for the noncommutative parameter $\\theta\\lesssim (10 \\,\\text{Gev})^{-2}$\ncould be obtained.\n", "  Donor impurity spins in silicon-28 are highly competitive qubits for upcoming\nsolid-state quantum technologies, yet a proven scalable strategy for\nmulti-qubit devices remains conspicuously absent. These CMOS-compatible,\natomically identical qubits offer significant advantages including 3-hour\ncoherence ($T_2$) lifetimes, as well as simultaneous qubit initialization,\nmanipulation and readout fidelities near $\\sim\\!99.9\\%$. These properties meet\nthe requirements for many modern quantum error correction protocols, which are\nessential for constructing large-scale universal quantum technologies. However,\na method of reliably coupling spatially-separated qubits, which crucially does\nnot sacrifice qubit quality and is robust to manufacturing imperfections, has\nyet to be identified. Here we present such a platform for donor qubits in\nsilicon, by exploiting optically-accessible `deep' chalcogen donors. We show\nthat these donors emit highly uniform light, can be optically initialized, and\noffer long-lived spin qubit ground states without requiring milliKelvin\ntemperatures. These combined properties make chalcogen donors uniquely suitable\nfor incorporation into silicon photonic architectures for single-shot\nsingle-qubit readout as well as for multi-qubit coupling. This unlocks clear\npathways for silicon-based quantum computing, spin to photon conversion,\nphotonic memories, silicon-integrated triggered single photon sources and\nall-optical silicon switches.\n", "  Photoluminescence is a phenomenon of significant interest due to its wide\nrange of technological applications in plasmonics, nanolasers, spasers, lasing\nspasers, loss compensation and gain in metamaterials, and luminescent media.\nNanostructured materials are known to have very different luminescence\ncharacteristics to bulk samples or planar films. Here we show that by\nengineering a nanostructured meta-surface, we can choose the position of\nphotoluminescence absorption and emission lines of thin gold films. The\nnanostructuring also aids to strong enhancement of the emission from gold, by a\nfactor of 76 in our experiments. This enhancement is determined by the relative\nposition of the engineered absorption and emission lines to the exciting laser\nwavelength and the intrinsic properties of the constituent material. These\nluminescence-engineered materials combined with a resonant material, as in the\nlasing spaser, or with the power of reconfigurable metamaterials promise huge\npotential as tunable nanoscale light sources.\n", "  We estimate the probability of a photon to move faster than light, under the\nEinstein dynamics which, unlike the wave equation or Maxwell wave dynamics, has\nsingular dispersion relation at zero momentum. We show that this probability\ngoes to zero with time, using propagation estimates suitably multi-scaled to\ncontrol the contribution of low frequencies. We then prove minimal velocity\nbounds\n", "  High-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy is used to examine\nthe electronic band structure of FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ near the Brillouin zone\ncenter. A consistent separation of the $\\alpha_{1}$ and $\\alpha_{2}$ bands is\nobserved with little $k_{z}$ dependence of the $\\alpha_{1}$ band.\nFirst-principles calculations for bulk and thin films demonstrate that the\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe atoms and hybridization-induced\nspin-orbit effects lifts the degeneracy of the Fe $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$\norbitals at the zone center leading to orbital ordering. These experimental and\ncomputational results provide a natural microscopic basis for the nematicity\nobserved in the Fe-based superconductors.\n", "  The electronic structure of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors can be\nsignificantly altered by screening effects, either from free charge carriers in\nthe material itself, or by environmental screening from the surrounding medium.\nThe physical properties of 2D semiconductors placed in a heterostructure with\nother 2D materials are therefore governed by a complex interplay of both intra-\nand inter-layer interactions. Here, using time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission, we are able to isolate both the layer-resolved band structure\nand, more importantly, the transient band structure evolution of a model 2D\nheterostructure formed of a single layer of MoS$_2$ on graphene. Our results\nreveal a pronounced renormalization of the quasiparticle gap of the MoS$_2$\nlayer. Following optical excitation, the band gap is reduced by up to\n$\\sim\\!$400 meV on femtosecond timescales due to a persistence of strong\nelectronic interactions despite the environmental screening by the $n$-doped\ngraphene. This points to a large degree of tuneability of both the electronic\nstructure and electron dynamics for 2D semiconductors embedded in a van der\nWaals-bonded heterostructure.\n", "  The self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory is\na useful tool for realizing the electronic structures of large molecular\ncomplex systems. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of C61,\nformed by fullerene C60 with a carbon adatom, using the fully localized limit\nand pseudo self-interaction correction methods of DFTB to adjust the Hubbard U\nparameter (DFTB+U). The results show that both the methods used to adjust U can\nsignificantly reduce the molecular orbital energy of occupied states localized\non the defect carbon atom and improve the gap between highest occupied\nmolecular orbital(HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital(LUMO) of C61.\nThis work will provide a methodological reference point for future DFTB\ncalculations of the electronic structures of carbon materials.\n", "  In order to develop a high spatial resolution (micron level) thermal neutron\ndetector, a detector assembly composed of cerium doped lithium glass\nmicrofibers, each with a diameter of 1\\,$\\mu$m, is proposed, where the neutron\nabsorption location is reconstructed from the observed charged particle\nproducts that result from neutron absorption. To suppress the cross talk of the\nscintillation light, each scintillating fiber is surrounded by air-filled glass\ncapillaries with the same diameter as the fiber. This pattern is repeated to\nform a bulk microfiber detector. On one end, the surface of the detector is\npainted with a thin optical reflector to increase the light collection\nefficiency at the other end. Then the scintillation light emitted by any\nneutron interaction is transmitted to one end, magnified, and recorded by an\nintensified CCD camera. A simulation based on the Geant4 toolkit was developed\nto model this detector. All the relevant physics processes including neutron\ninteraction, scintillation, and optical boundary behaviors are si\\-mulated.\nThis simulation was first validated through measurements of neutron response\nfrom lithium glass cylinders. With good expected light collection, an algorithm\nbased upon the features inherent to alpha and triton particle tracks is\nproposed to reconstruct the neutron reaction position in the glass fiber array.\nGiven a 1\\,$\\mu$m fiber diameter and 0.1\\,mm detector thickness, the neutron\nspatial resolution is expected to reach $\\sigma\\sim 1\\, \\mu$m with a Gaussian\nfit in each lateral dimension. The detection efficiency was estimated to be\n3.7\\% for a glass fiber assembly with thickness of 0.1\\,mm. When the detector\nthickness increases from 0.1\\,mm to 1\\,mm, the position resolution is not\nexpected to vary much, while the detection efficiency is expected to increase\nby about a factor of ten.\n", "  We show that wave operators for three dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators\n$H=-\\Delta + V$ with threshold singularities are bounded in $L^1({\\mathbb\nR}^3)$ if and only if zero energy resonances are absent from $H$ and the\nexistence of zero energy eigenfunctions does not destroy the $L^1$-boundedness\nof wave operators for $H$ with the regular threshold behavior. We also show in\nthis case that they are bounded in $L^p({\\mathbb R}^3)$ for all $1\\leq p \\leq\n\\infty$ if all zero energy eigenfunctions $\\phi(x)$ have vanishing first three\nmoments: $\\int_{{\\mathbb R}^3} x^\\alpha V(x)\\phi(x)dx=0$, $|\\alpha|=0,1,2$.\n", "  We propose a new detection method for gravitational wave bursts. It analyzes\nobserved data with the Hilbert-Huang transform, which is an approach of\ntime-frequency analysis constructed with the aim of manipulating non-linear and\nnon-stationary data. Using the simulated time-series noise data and waveforms\nfrom rotating core-collapse supernovae at 30 kpc, we performed simulation to\nevaluate the performance of our method and it revealed the total detection\nprobability to be 0.94 without false alerms, which corresponds to the false\nalarm rate < 0.001 Hz. The detection probability depends on the characteristics\nof the waveform, but it was found that the parameter determining the degree of\ndifferential rotation of the collapsing star is the most important for the\nperformance of our method.\n", "  What is the minimum amount of information and time needed to solve 2SAT? When\nthe instance is known, it can be solved in polynomial time, but is this also\npossible without knowing the instance? Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC '13)\nconsidered a model where the input is accessed by proposing possible\nassignments to a special oracle. This oracle, on encountering some constraint\nunsatisfied by the proposal, returns only the constraint index. It turns out\nthat, in this model, even 1SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP.\nHence, we consider a model in which the input is accessed by proposing\nprobability distributions over assignments to the variables. The oracle then\nreturns the index of the constraint that is most likely to be violated by this\ndistribution. We show that the information obtained this way is sufficient to\nsolve 1SAT in polynomial time, even when the clauses can be repeated. For 2SAT,\nas long as there are no repeated clauses, in polynomial time we can even learn\nan equivalent formula for the hidden instance and hence also solve it.\nFurthermore, we extend these results to the quantum regime. We show that in\nthis setting 1QSAT can be solved in polynomial time up to constant precision,\nand 2QSAT can be learnt in polynomial time up to inverse polynomial precision.\n", "  CMB foregrounds consist of all radiation between the surface of last\nscattering and the detectors, which can interfere with the cosmological\ninterpretation of CMB data. Fortunately, in temperature (intensity), even\nthough the foregrounds are complex they can relatively easily be mitigated.\nHowever, in polarization, diffuse Galactic radiation (synchrotron and thermal\ndust) can be polarized at a level of >10 % making it more of a challenge. In\nparticular, CMB B-modes, which are a smoking-gun signature of inflation, will\nbe dominated by foregrounds. Component separation will therefore be critical\nfor future CMB polarization missions, requiring many channels covering a wide\nrange of frequencies, to ensure that foreground modelling errors are minimised.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical analysis of the electronic structure of\n$c$-plane InGaN/GaN quantum wells with indium contents varying between 10\\% and\n25\\%. The electronic structure of the quantum wells is treated by means of an\natomistic tight-binding model, accounting for variations in strain and built-in\nfield due to random alloy fluctuations. Our analysis reveals strong\nlocalisation effects in the hole states. These effects are found not only in\nthe ground states, but also the excited states. We conclude that localisation\neffects persist to of order 100~meV into the valence band, for as little as\n10\\% indium in the quantum well, giving rise to a significant density of\nlocalised states. We find, from an examination of the modulus overlap of the\nwave functions, that the hole states can be divided into three regimes of\nlocalisation. Our results also show that localisation effects due to random\nalloy fluctuations are far less pronounced for electron states. However, the\ncombination of electrostatic built-in field, alloy fluctuations and structural\ninhomogeneities, such as well-width fluctuations, can nevertheless lead to\nsignificant localisation effects in the electron states, especially at higher\nindium contents. Overall, our results are indicative of individually localised\nelectron and hole states, consistent with the experimentally proposed\nexplanation of time-dependent photoluminescence results in $c$-plane InGaN/GaN\nQWs.\n", "  It is shown that in one-particle Schr\\\"{o}dinger quantum mechanics a small\nperturbation of a one-dimensional potential can produce a large change in the\nground state, the effect becoming more pronounced with growing typical length\nof the potential, contrary to what standard stationary perturbation theory\ncould make one believe.The possible consequences of this result for solid state\nphysics and other fields are also discussed, and examples of such non-standard\nperturbations are furnished.\n", "  Taking advantages of the broad emission bands of a Yb3+ doped calcium yttrium\noxoborate (Yb:YCOB) crystal cut along the optimized direction out of principle\nplanes with the maximum effective nonlinear coefficient, the\nself-frequency-doubled green light based on the self-frequency-doubling\nbehavior of Yb:YCOB was achieved with a maximum output power of 710 mW at 523\nnm.\n", "  The CoCrFeNi alloy is widely accepted as an exemplary stable base for high\nentropy alloys (HEAs). Although various investigations prove it to be stable\nsolid solution, its phase stability is still suspicious. Here, we identified\nthat the CoCrFeNi HEA was thermally metastable at intermediate temperatures,\nand composition decomposition occurred after annealed at 750oC for 800 hrs. The\nincreased lattice distortion induced by minor addition of Al into the CoCrFeNi\nbase accelerated the composition decomposition and a second fcc phase with a\ndifferent lattice constant occurred in the long time annealed CoCrFeNiAl0.1\nHEA. A Cr-rich {\\sigma} phase also precipitated from the CoCrFeNiAl0.1 HEA. The\nAl element can induce the instability of CoCrFeNi HEA. The revealed metastable\nCoCrFeNi at intermediate temperatures will greatly change the way of HEAs\ndevelopment.\n", "  When P indistinguishable balls are randomly distributed among L\ndistinguishable boxes, and considering the dense system in which P much greater\nthan L, our natural intuition tells us that the box with the average number of\nballs has the highest probability and that none of boxes are empty; however in\nreality, the probability of the empty box is always the highest. This fact is\nwith contradistinction to sparse system in which the number of balls is smaller\nthan the number of boxes (i.e. energy distribution in gas) in which the average\nvalue has the highest probability. Here we show that when we postulate the\nrequirement that all possible configurations of balls in the boxes have equal\nprobabilities, a realistic \"long tail\" distribution is obtained. This formalism\nwhen applied for sparse systems converges to distributions in which the average\nis preferred. We calculate some of the distributions resulted from this\npostulate and obtain most of the known distributions in nature, namely, Zipf\nlaw, Benford law, particles energy distributions, and more. Further\ngeneralization of this novel approach yields not only much better predictions\nfor election polls, market share distribution among competing companies and so\nforth, but also a compelling probabilistic explanation for Planck's famous\nempirical finding that the energy of a photon is hv.\n", "  The quasi-one-dimensional rhombic array of the waveguides is considered.\nSystem of equations describing coupled waves in the waveguide in the linear\nlimit is solved exactly. The electric field distribution was found both for the\ndiffractionless (or dispersionless) flat band modes and for the dispersive\nmodes.\n", "  It is well known that the irradiation-induced defects strongly influence the\nmechanical properties of zirconium (Zr) or its alloys in nuclear reactors.\nHowever, how the point defect changes the mechanical properties has been rarely\nstudied. Here, we systematically investigated the effect of vacancies on the\nmechanical properties of alpha-Zr based on density functional theory (DFT).\nBoth uniformly distributed vacancies and vacancy clusters were considered. Our\nresults reveal that the existence of vacancy will reduce the bulk modulus,\nwhile enhance the shear and Young's moduli. Based on these moduli, the\nductility and hardness were further calculated. With the introduction of\nvacancy, the ductility decreases, but the hardness increases. However, when the\nvacancy concentration is larger than a critical value, a rise in the ductility\nand a reduction in the hardness occur, which indicates the degeneration of the\nmaterial. Moreover, it was found that the vacancies lead to a more isotropic\ndistribution of Young's modulus in 3D space. To further investigate how the\nclustering of vacancies influences the mechanical properties, the most stable\nconfigurations of di- and trivacancy clusters have been predicted, which\ncorrespond to the most compact distribution of vacancies. Compared with the\nuniform distribution of vacancies, clustering of vacancies will strengthen the\nabove changes of elastic moduli, ductility and hardness. Our results indicate\nthat the increase of the vacancy concentration may be the basic cause for the\nchanges of the mechanical properties under irradiation, while the formation of\nvacancy clusters intensifies these changes.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of noninteracting electrons on a square lattice in\nthe presence of a magnetic flux {\\alpha} and a dc electric field E oriented\nalong the lattice diagonal. In general, the adiabatic dynamics of an electron\nwill be characterized by Bloch oscillations in the electrical field direction\nand dispersive ballistic transport in the perpendicular direction. For rational\nvalues of {\\alpha} and a corresponding discrete set of values of E({\\alpha})\nvanishing gaps in the spectrum induce a fractionalization of the charge in the\nperpendicular direction - while left movers are still performing dispersive\nballistic transport, the complementary fraction of right movers is propagating\nin a dispersionless relativistic manner in the opposite direction.\nGeneralizations to other field directions, lattice symmetries and the possible\nprobing of the effect with atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and photonic\nnetworks are discussed.\n", "  Traditional analytical theories of celestial mechanics are not well-adapted\nwhen dealing with highly elliptical orbits. On the one hand, analytical\nsolutions are quite generally expanded into power series of the eccentricity\nand so limited to quasi-circular orbits. On the other hand, the time-dependency\ndue to the motion of the third body (e.g. Moon and Sun) is almost always\nneglected. We propose several tools to overcome these limitations. Firstly, we\nhave expanded the third-body disturbing function into a finite polynomial using\nFourier series in multiple of the satellite's eccentric anomaly (instead of the\nmean anomaly) and involving Hansen-like coefficients. Next, by combining the\nclassical Brouwer-von Zeipel procedure and the time-dependent Lie-Deprit\ntransforms, we have performed a normalization of the expanded Hamiltonian in\norder to eliminate all the periodic terms. One of the benefits is that the\noriginal Brouwer solution for J2 is not modified. The main difficulty lies in\nthe fact that the generating functions of the transformation must be computed\nby solving a partial differential equation, involving derivatives with respect\nto the mean anomaly, which appears implicitly in the perturbation. We present a\nmethod to solve this equation by means of an iterative process. Finally we have\nobtained an analytical tool useful for the mission analysis, allowing to\npropagate the osculating motion of objects on highly elliptical orbits (e>0.6)\nover long periods efficiently with very high accuracy, or to determine initial\nelements or mean elements. Comparisons between the complete solution and the\nnumerical simulations will be presented.\n", "  A conjectural relationship between the GUE partition function with even\ncouplings and certain special cubic Hodge integrals over the moduli spaces of\nstable algebraic curves is under consideration.\n", "  There has been considerable interest in topological semi-metals that exhibit\nextreme magnetoresistance (XMR). These have included materials lacking\ninversion symmetry such as TaAs, as well Dirac semi-metals such as Cd3As2.\nHowever, it was reported recently that LaSb and LaBi also exhibit XMR, even\nthough the rock-salt structure of these materials has inversion symmetry, and\nthe band-structure calculations do not show a Dirac dispersion in the bulk.\nHere, we present magnetoresistance and specific heat measurements on NdSb,\nwhich is isostructural with LaSb. NdSb has an antiferromagnetic groundstate,\nand in analogy with the lanthanum monopnictides, is expected to be a\ntopologically non-trivial semi-metal. We show that NdSb has an XMR of 10^4 %,\neven within the AFM state, illustrating that XMR can occur independently of the\nabsence of time reversal symmetry breaking in zero magnetic field. The\npersistence of XMR in a magnetic system offers promise of new functionality\nwhen combining topological matter with electronic correlations. We also find\nthat in an applied magnetic field below the Neel temperature there is a first\norder transition, consistent with evidence from previous neutron scattering\nwork.\n", "  We introduce the 4 Pi Sky 'hub', a collection of open data-services and\nunderlying software packages built for rapid, fully automated reporting and\nresponse to astronomical transient alerts. These packages build on the mature\n'VOEvent' standardized message-format, and aim to provide a decentralized and\nopen infrastructure for handling transient alerts. In particular we draw\nattention to the initial release of voeventdb, an archive and remote-query\nservice that allows astronomers to make historical queries about transient\nalerts. By employing spatial filters and web-of-citation lookups, voeventdb\nenables cross-matching of transient alerts to bring together data from multiple\nsources, as well as providing a point of reference when planning new follow-up\ncampaigns. We also highlight the recent addition of optical-transient feeds\nfrom the ASASSN and GAIA projects to our VOEvent distribution stream. Both the\nsource-code and deployment-scripts which implement these services are freely\navailable and permissively licensed, with the intention that other teams may\nuse them to implement local or project-specific VOEvent archives. In the course\nof describing these packages we provide a basic primer for getting started with\nautomated transient astronomy, including a condensed introduction to the\nVOEvent standard.\n", "  A talk presented at the April 2016 APS meeting in Salt Lake City: The speaker\nhad the great good fortune to take an undergraduate course in group theory from\nSidney Coleman, and (after graduate school away) was hired by Coleman to a\npostdoctoral position and eventually became a faculty colleague. He will share\nsome still vivid memories of this remarkable character.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength investigation of the young stellar population\nand star formation activities around the \\hii region Sharpless 311. Using our\ndeep near-infrared observations and archival {\\it Spitzer}-IRAC observations,\nwe have detected a total of 125 young stellar objects (YSOs) in an area of\n$\\sim$86 arcmin$^2$. The YSOs sample include 8 Class I and 117 Class II\ncandidate YSOs. The mass completeness of the identified YSOs sample is\nestimated to be 1.0 \\msun. The ages and masses of the majority of the candidate\nYSOs are estimated to be in the range of $\\sim$0.1$-$5 Myr and $\\sim$0.3$-$6\n\\msun, respectively. The 8 \\mum image of S311 displays an approximately\nspherical cavity around the ionizing source which is possibly created due to\nthe expansion of the \\hii region. The spatial distribution of the candidate\nYSOs reveals that a significant number of them are distributed systematically\nalong the 8 $\\mu$m emission with a majority clustered around the eastern border\nof the \\hii region. Four clumps/compact \\hii regions are detected in the radio\ncontinuum observations at 1280 MHz, which might have been formed during the\nexpansion of the \\hii region. The estimated dynamical age of the region,\nmain-sequence lifetime of the ionizing source, the spatial distribution and\nages of the candidate YSOs indicate triggered star formation in the complex.\n", "  It is a widely held view that analytical integration is more accurate than\nthe numerical one. In some special cases, however, numerical integration can be\nmore advantageous than analytical integration. In our paper we show this\nbenefit for the case of electric potential and field computation of charged\ntriangles and rectangles applied in the boundary element method (BEM).\nAnalytical potential and field formulas are rather complicated (even in the\nsimplest case of constant charge densities), they have usually large\ncomputation times, and at field points far from the elements they suffer from\nlarge rounding errors. On the other hand, Gaussian cubature, which is an\nefficient numerical integration method, yields simple and fast potential and\nfield formulas that are very accurate far from the elements. The simplicity of\nthe method is demonstrated by the physical picture: the triangles and\nrectangles with their continuous charge distributions are replaced by discrete\npoint charges, whose simple potential and field formulas explain the higher\naccuracy and speed of this method. We implemented the Gaussian cubature method\nfor the purpose of BEM computations both with CPU and GPU, and we compare its\nperformance with two different analytical integration methods. The ten\ndifferent Gaussian cubature formulas presented in our paper can be used for\narbitrary high-precision and fast integrations over triangles and rectangles.\n", "  The individual building blocks of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host\nfascinating physical phenomena, ranging from ballistic electron transport in\ngraphene to striking optical properties of MoSe2 sheets. The presence of bonded\nand non-bonded cohesive interactions in a vdW heterostructure, promotes\ndiversity in their structural arrangements, which in turn profoundly modulate\nthe properties of their individual constituents. Here, we report on the\npresence of correlated structural disorder coexisting with the nearly perfect\ncrystallographic order along the growth direction of epitaxial vdW\nheterostructures of Bi2Se3/graphene/SiC. Using the depth penetration of X-ray\ndiffraction microscopy and scattering, we probed their crystal structure from\natomic to mesoscopic length scales, to reveal that their structural diversity\nis underpinned by spatially correlated disorder states. The presence of the\nlatter induces on a system, widely considered to behave as a collection of\nnearly independent 2-dimensional units, a pseudo-3-dimensional character, when\nsubjected to epitaxial constraints and ordered substrate interactions. These\nfindings shed new light on the nature of the vast structural landscape of vdW\nheterostructures and could enable new avenues in modulating their unique\nproperties by correlated disorder.\n", "  The purpose of this modest note is to point out that the proof of the recent\nresult of Huchcroft concerning continuity of phase transition in Bernoulli\npercolation is applicable to the setting of the Ising model with free boundary\ncondition. This observation, together with a recent result of Aizenman,\nDuminil-Copin, and Sidoravicius implies that the Ising model on amenable\nquasi-transitive graph with exponential growth undergoes a second order phase\ntransition.\n", "  Earlier observational studies have used the time evolution of emerging\nmagnetic flux regions at the photosphere to infer their subsurface structures,\nassuming that the flux structure does not change significantly over the\nnear-surface layer.In this study, we test the validity of this assumption by\ncomparing the horizontal and vertical motions of an emerging active region. The\ntwo motions would be correlated if the emerging structure is rigid. The\nselected active region (AR) NOAA 11645 is not embedded in detectable\npreexisting magnetic field. The observed horizontal motion is quantified by the\nseparation of the two AR polarities and the extension of the region. The\nvertical motion is derived from the magnetic buoyancy theory. Our results show\nthat the separation of the polarities is fastest at the beginning with a\nvelocity of $\\approx$~4~Mm hr$^{-1}$ and decreases to $\\le$~1~Mm hr$^{-1}$\nafter the main growing phase of flux emergence. The derived thick flux-tube\nbuoyant velocity is between 1 and 3~Mm hr$^{-1}$ while the thin flux-tube\napproximation results in an unreasonably high buoyant velocity, consistent with\nthe expectation that the approximation is inappropriate at the surface layer.\nThe observed horizontal motion is not found to directly correlate with either\nthe magnetic field strength or the derived buoyant velocities. However, the\npercentage of the horizontally oriented fields and the temporal derivatives of\nthe field strength and the buoyant velocity show some positive correlations\nwith the separation velocity. The results of this study imply that the\nassumption that the emerging active region is the cross section of a rising\nflux tube whose structure can be considered rigid as it rises through the\nnear-surface layer should be taken with caution.\n", "  We consider the problem of how to optimize multi-stage campaigning over\nsocial networks. The dynamic programming framework is employed to balance the\nhigh present reward and large penalty on low future outcome in the presence of\nextensive uncertainties. In particular, we establish theoretical foundations of\noptimal campaigning over social networks where the user activities are modeled\nas a multivariate Hawkes process, and we derive a time dependent linear\nrelation between the intensity of exogenous events and several commonly used\nobjective functions of campaigning. We further develop a convex dynamic\nprogramming framework for determining the optimal intervention policy that\nprescribes the required level of external drive at each stage for the desired\ncampaigning result. Experiments on both synthetic data and the real-world\nMemeTracker dataset show that our algorithm can steer the user activities for\noptimal campaigning much more accurately than baselines.\n", "  CoCr$_2$O$_4$ has attracted significant attention recently due to several\ninteresting properties such as magnetostriction, magnetoelectricity etc.. More\nrecent experiments on Fe substituted CoCr$_2$O$_4$ observed a variety of novel\nphenomena such as the magnetic compensation accompanied by the occurrence of\nexchange bias, which reverses its sign. Understanding of such phenomena may\nlead to control the properties of these material in an efficient way to enhance\nits potential for multifunctional applications. In this paper, we study the\nmicroscopic understanding of Fe doping in modifying the structural and magnetic\nproperties of CoCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ with varying composition and substitution of Fe\nat different sublattices by first-principles density functional calculations.\nWe have analysed in detail the effect of Fe substitution on crystal field and\nexchange splittings, magnetic moments and interatomic exchange parameters. It\nis also observed that with increasing concentration of Fe impurity, the system\nhas a tendency towards forming an \"Inverse Spinel\" structure as observed in\nexperiments. Such tendencies are crucial to understand this system as it would\nlead to modifications in the magnetic exchange interactions associated with\nsites with different symmetry finally affecting the magnetic structure and the\nmultiferrocity in turn.\n", "  When talking to secondary school students, first impressions are crucial.\nAccidentally say something that sounds boring and you'll lose them in seconds.\nA physical demonstration can be an eye-catching way to begin an activity or\nspark off a conversation about mathematics. This is especially true in the\ncontext of an event like a science fair where there are hundreds of other\nexhibitors and stands, possibly involving loud music and/or dancing robots!\n  In this article we describe three devices that were built to illustrate\nspecific physical phenomena that occur in the human body. Each device\ncorresponds to a simple mathematical model which contains both elements that\nare accessible to pupils in the early years of secondary education and more\nchallenging mathematical concepts that might appeal to A-level students. Two of\nthe devices relate to the Windkessel effect, a physical phenomenon that\nregulates blood flow, and the third demonstrates the elastic properties of\nligaments and tendons.\n", "  One possible origin of high velocity stars in the Galaxy is that they are the\nproduct of the interaction of binary systems and supermassive black holes. We\ninvestigate a new production channel of high velocity stars as due to the close\ninteraction between a star cluster and supermassive black holes in galactic\ncentres. The high velocity acquired by some stars of the cluster comes from\ncombined effect of extraction of their gravitational binding energy and from\nthe slingshot due to the interaction with the black holes. Stars could reach a\nvelocity sufficient to travel in the halo and even overcome the galactic\npotential well, while some of them are just stripped from the cluster and start\norbiting around the galactic centre.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the Tsallis non extensive statistics introduced\nby intrinsic temperature fluctuations in p-Air ultra high energy interactions\non observables of cosmic ray showers, such as the slant depth of the maximum\nXmax and the muon number on the ground $n_{\\mu}$. The results show that these\nobservables are significantly affected by temperature fluctuations and agree\nqualitatively with the Heitler model predictions.\n", "  Dislocations corresponding to a change of stacking in two-dimensional\nhexagonal bilayers, graphene and boron nitride, and associated with boundaries\nbetween commensurate domains are investigated using the two-chain\nFrenkel-Kontorova model on top of ab initio calculations. Structural\ntransformations of bilayers in which the bottom layer is stretched and the\nupper one is left to relax freely are considered for gradually increased\nelongation of the bottom layer. Formation energies of dislocations, dislocation\nwidth and orientation of the boundary between commensurate domains are analyzed\ndepending on the magnitude and direction of elongation. The second-order phase\ntransition from the commensurate phase to the incommensurate one with multiple\ndislocations is predicted to take place at some critical elongation. The order\nparameter for this transition corresponds to the density of dislocations, which\ngrows continuously upon increasing the elongation of the bottom layer above the\ncritical value. In graphene and metastable boron nitride with the layers\naligned in the same direction, where elementary dislocations are partial, this\ntransition, however, is preceded by formation of the first dislocation at the\nelongation smaller than the critical one. The phase diagrams including this\nintermediate state are plotted in coordinates of the magnitude and direction of\nelongation of the bottom layer.\n", "  Open heavy-flavour and quarkonia measurements are important tools to study\nthe hot and dense partonic medium formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. The modification of their production in those collisions, with\nrespect to the pp and p-Pb ones, can help in the characterization of this\nmedium. Quarkonia and open heavy-flavour production is measured in ALICE in the\nthree different collision systems, at mid- and forward rapidity. A selection of\nthose results recently obtained in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions by the ALICE\nCollaboration is presented.\n", "  In the course of the growth of the Internet and due to increasing\navailability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science\nhas established itself as an own area of research. With quantitative scientists\nfrom computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from\nbiology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network\nscience serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major\ngoals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological\ngraph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from\nthe same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.\nHowever, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically\nimplies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this\ngap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a\ngeneral introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work\ndevoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major\nchallenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node\nsubgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may\nparticipate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,\na novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic\nbuilding blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -\nsubgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at\nrandom - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.\nFinally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical\nprocesses acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs\nimpose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a\nlarger network structure.\n", "  Thin membranes, such as monolayer graphene of monoatomic thickness, are bound\nto exhibit lateral buckling under uniaxial tensile loading that impairs its\nmechanical behaviour. In this work, we have developed an experimental device to\nsubject 2D materials to controlled equibiaxial strain on supported beams that\ncan be flexed up or down to subject the material to either compression or\ntension, respectively. Using strain gauges in tandem with Raman spectroscopy\nmeasurements, we monitor the G and 2D phonon properties of graphene under\nbiaxial strain and thus extract important information about the uptake of\nstress under these conditions. The experimental shift over strain for the G and\n2D Raman peaks were found to be in the range of 62.3 \\pm 5 cm^-1/%, and 148.2\n\\pm 6 cm^-1/%, respectively, for monolayer but also bilayer graphenes. The\ncorresponding Gruneisen parameters for the G and 2D peaks were found to be\nbetween 1.97 \\pm 0.15 and 2.86 \\pm 0.12, respectively. These values agree\nreasonable well with those obtained from small-strain bubble-type experiments.\nThe results presented are also backed up by classical and ab initio molecular\ndynamics simulations and excellent agreement of \\Gamma-E2g shifts with strains\nand the Gruneisen parameter was observed.\n", "  When subjected to electromagnetic radiation, the fluctuation of the\nelectronic current across a quantum conductor increases. This additional noise,\ncalled photon-assisted shot noise, arises from the generation and subsequent\npartition of electron-hole pairs in the conductor. The physics of\nphoton-assisted shot noise has been thoroughly investigated at microwave\nfrequencies up to 20 GHz, and its robustness suggests that it could be extended\nto the Terahertz (THz) range. Here, we present measurements of the quantum shot\nnoise generated in a graphene nanoribbon subjected to a THz radiation. Our\nresults show signatures of photon-assisted shot noise, further demonstrating\nthat hallmark time-dependant quantum transport phenomena can be transposed to\nthe THz range.\n", "  In this paper, we are concerned with the study of the Isotropic Diffusion\nSource Approximation (IDSA) (Baxter et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 046118, 2006) of\nradiative transfer. After having recalled well-known limits of the radiative\ntransfer equation, we present the IDSA and adapt it to the case of the\nhomogeneous sphere. We then show that for this example the IDSA suffers from\nsevere numerical difficulties. We argue that these difficulties originate in\nthe min-max switch coupling mechanism used in the IDSA. To overcome this\nproblem we reformulate the IDSA to avoid the problematic coupling. This allows\nus to access the modeling error of the IDSA for the homogeneous sphere test\ncase. The IDSA is shown to overestimate the streaming component, hence we\npropose a new version of the IDSA which is numerically shown to be more\naccurate than the old one.\n  Analytical results and numerical tests are provided to support the accuracy\nof the new proposed approximation.\n", "  The design and realization of a cryogenic rig for point-contact spectroscopy\nmeasurements in the needle-anvil configuration is presented. Thanks to the use\nof two piezoelectric nano-positioners, the tip can move along the vertical\n($z$) and horizontal ($x$) direction and thus the rig is suitable to probe\ndifferent regions of a sample \\textit{in situ}. Moreover, it can also form\ndouble point-contacts on different facets of a single crystal for achieving,\ne.g., an interferometer configuration for phase-sensitive measurements. For the\nlatter purpose, the sample holder can also host a Helmholtz coil for applying a\nsmall transverse magnetic field to the junction. A semi-rigid coaxial cable can\nbe easily added for studying the behavior of Josephson junctions under\nmicrowave irradiation. The rig can be detached from the probe and thus used\nwith different cryostats. The performance of this new probe has been tested in\na Quantum Design PPMS system by conducting point-contact Andreev reflection\nmeasurements on Nb thin films over large areas as a function of temperature and\nmagnetic field.\n", "  The connection between coined and continuous-time quantum walk models has\nbeen addressed in a number of papers. In most of those studies, the\ncontinuous-time model is derived from coined quantum walks by employing\ndimensional reduction and taking appropriate limits. In this work, we produce\nthe evolution of a coined quantum walk on a generic graph using a\ncontinuous-time quantum walk on a larger graph. In addition to expanding the\nunderlying structure, we also have to switch on and off edges during the\ncontinuous-time evolution to accommodate the alternation between the shift and\ncoin operators from the coined model. In one particular case, the connection is\nvery natural, and the continuous-time quantum walk that simulates the coined\nquantum walk is driven by the graph Laplacian on the dynamically changing\nexpanded graph.\n", "  Molecular dynamics is a powerful method for studying the behaviour of\nmaterials at high temperature. In practice, however, its effectiveness in\nrepresenting real systems is limited by the accuracy of the forces, finite size\neffects, quantization, and equilibration methods. In this paper we report and\ndiscuss some calculations carried out using molecular dynamics on high pressure\nhydrogen, reviewing a number of sources of error. We find that the neglect of\nzero-point vibrations is quantitively the largest. We show that simulations\nusing ab initio molecular dynamics with the PBE functional predict a large\nstability field for the molecular Cmca-4 structure at pressures just above\nthose achieved in current experiments above the stability range of the mixed-\nmolecular layered Phase IV. However, the various errors in the simulation all\npoint towards a much smaller stability range, and the likelihood of a\nnon-molecular phase based on low-coordination networks or chains of atoms.\n", "  We investigate the universality classes of rank-4 colored bipartite U(1)\ntensor field models near the Gaussian fixed point with the functional\nrenormalization group. In a truncation that contains all power counting\nrelevant and marginal operators, we find a one-dimensional UV attractor that is\nconnected with the Gaussian fixed point. Hence this is first evidence that the\nmodel could be asymptotically safe due to a mechanism similar to the one found\nin the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model, whose UV behavior near the Gaussian fixed point\nis also described by one-dimensional attractor that contains the Gaussian fixed\npoint. However, the cancellation mechanism that is responsible for the\nsimultaneous vanishing of the beta functions is new to tensor models, i.e. it\ndoes not occur in vector or matrix models.\n", "  The dynamics of populations is frequently subject to intrinsic noise. At the\nsame time unknown interaction networks or rate constants can present quenched\nuncertainty. Existing approaches often involve repeated sampling of the\nquenched disorder and then running the stochastic birth-death dynamics on these\nsamples. In this paper we take a different view, and formulate an effective\njump process, representative of the ensemble of quenched interactions as a\nwhole. Using evolutionary games with random payoff matrices as an example, we\ndevelop an algorithm to simulate this process, and we discuss diffusion\napproximations in the limit of weak intrinsic noise.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that many species of microorganisms leave a\nsolid surface at a fixed angle determined by steric interactions and near-field\nhydrodynamics. This angle is completely independent of the incoming angle. For\nseveral collisions in a closed body this determines a unique type of billiard\nsystem, an aspecular billiard in which the outgoing angle is fixed for all\ncollisions. We analyze such a system using numerical simulation of this\nbilliard for varying tables and outgoing angles, and also utilize the theory of\none-dimensional maps and wavefront dynamics. When applicable we cite results\nfrom and compare our system to similar billiard systems in the literature. We\nfocus on examples from three broad classes: the ellipse, the Bunimovich\nbilliards, and the Sinai billiards. The effect of a noisy outgoing angle is\nalso discussed.\n", "  We discuss scientific realism from the perspective of modern cosmology,\nespecially primordial cosmology: i.e. the cosmological investigation of the\nvery early universe.\n  We first (Section 2) state our allegiance to scientific realism, and discuss\nwhat insights about it cosmology might yield, as against \"just\" supplying\nscientific claims that philosophers can then evaluate. In particular, we\ndiscuss: the idea of laws of cosmology, and limitations on ascertaining the\nglobal structure of spacetime. Then we review some of what is now known about\nthe early universe (Section 3): meaning, roughly, from a thousandth of a second\nafter the Big Bang onwards(!).\n  The rest of the paper takes up two issues about primordial cosmology, i.e.\nthe very early universe, where \"very early\" means, roughly, much earlier\n(logarithmically) than one second after the Big Bang: say, less than $10^{-11}$\nseconds. Both issues illustrate that familiar philosophical threat to\nscientific realism, the under-determination of theory by data---on a cosmic\nscale.\n  The first issue (Section 4) concerns the difficulty of observationally\nprobing the very early universe. More specifically, the difficulty is to\nascertain details of the putative inflationary epoch. The second issue (Section\n5) concerns difficulties about confirming a cosmological theory that postulates\na multiverse, i.e. a set of domains (universes) each of whose inhabitants (if\nany) cannot directly observe, or otherwise causally interact with, other\ndomains. This again concerns inflation, since many inflationary models\npostulate a multiverse.\n  For all these issues, it will be clear that much remains unsettled, as\nregards both physics and philosophy. But we will maintain that these remaining\ncontroversies do not threaten scientific realism.\n", "  We present a new scenario for magnetic field amplification where an\nelectrically conducting fluid is confined in a differentially rotating,\nspherical shell with thin aspect-ratio. When the angular momentum sufficiently\ndecreases outwards, an hydrodynamic instability develops in the equatorial\nregion, characterised by pairs of counter-rotating toroidal vortices similar to\nthose observed in cylindrical Couette flow. These spherical Taylor-Couette\nvortices generate a subcritical dynamo magnetic field dominated by\nnon-axisymmetric components. We show that the critical magnetic Reynolds number\nseems to reach a constant value at large Reynolds number and that the global\nrotation can strongly decrease the dynamo onset. Our numerical results are\nunderstood within the framework of a simple dynamical system, and we propose a\nlow-dimensional model for subcritical dynamo bifurcations. Implications for\nboth laboratory dynamos and astrophysical magnetic fields are finally\ndiscussed.\n", "  Glasses are ubiquitous in daily life and technology. However the microscopic\nmechanisms generating this state of matter remain subject to debate: Glasses\nare considered either as merely hyper-viscous liquids or as resulting from a\ngenuine thermodynamic phase transition towards a rigid state. We show that\nthird- and fifth-order susceptibilities provide a definite answer to this\nlongstanding controversy. Performing the corresponding high-precision nonlinear\ndielectric experiments for supercooled glycerol and propylene carbonate, we\nfind strong support for theories based upon thermodynamic amorphous order.\nMoreover, when lowering temperature, we find that the growing transient domains\nare compact - that is their fractal dimension d_f = 3. The glass transition may\nthus represent a class of critical phenomena different from canonical\nsecond-order phase transitions for which d_f < 3.\n", "  People are often challenged to select one among several alternatives. This\nsituation is present not only in decisions about complex issues, e.g.,\npolitical or academic choices, but also about trivial ones, as in daily\npurchases at a supermarket. We tackle this scenario by means of the tools of\nstatistical mechanics. Following this approach, we introduce and analyze a\nmodel of opinion dynamics, using a Potts-like state variable to represent the\nmultiple choices, including the ``undecided state'', that represents the\nindividuals that do not make a choice. We investigate the dynamics over\nErd\\\"{o}s-R\\'enyi and Barab\\'asi-Albert networks, two paradigmatic classes with\nthe small-world property, and we show the impact of the type of network on the\nopinion dynamics. Depending on the number of available options $q$ and on the\ndegree distribution of the network of contacts, different final steady states\nare accessible: from a wide distribution of choices to a state where a given\noption largely dominates. The abrupt transition between them is consistent with\nthe sudden viral dominance of a given option over many similar ones. Moreover,\nthe probability distributions produced by the model are validated by real data.\nFinally, we show that the model also contemplates the real situation of\noverchoice, where a large number of similar alternatives makes the choice\nprocess harder and indecision prevail.\n", "  We investigate serial correlation, periodic, aperiodic and scaling behaviour\nof eigenmodes, i.e. daily price fluctuation time-series derived from\neigenvectors, of correlation matrices of shares listed on the Johannesburg\nStock Exchange (JSE) from January 1993 to December 2002. Periodic, or calendar,\ncomponents are detected by spectral analysis. We find that calendar effects are\nlimited to eigenmodes which correspond to eigenvalues outside the Wishart\nrange. Using a variance ratio test, we uncover serial correlation in the first\neigenmodes and find slight negative serial correlation for eigenmodes within\nthe Wishart range. Our spectral analysis and variance ratio investigations\nsuggest that interpolating missing data or illiquid trading days with\nzero-order hold introduces high frequency noise and spurious serial\ncorrelation.\n  Aperiodic and scaling behaviour of the eigenmodes are investigated by using\nrescaled-range (R/S) methods and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). We find\nthat DFA and classic and modified R/S exponents suggest the presence of\nlong-term memory effects in the first five eigenmodes.\n", "  We calculate the one-loop $Z^0$-penguin contributions to the rare K-decays,\n$K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar \\nu$, $K_L \\to \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar \\nu$ and $K_L \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$, from the unit-charged technipions $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_8$ in the framework\nof the Multiscale Walking Technicolor Model. We find that: (a) the $\\pi_1$ and\n$\\pi_8$ can provide one to two orders enhancements to the branching ratios of\nthe rare K-decays; (b) by comparing the experimental data of $Br(K^+ \\to \\pi^+\n\\nu \\bar \\nu)$ with the theoretical prediction one finds the lower mass bounds,\n$m_{p8} \\geq 249 GeV$ for $F_Q=40GeV$ and $m_{p1}=100 GeV$; (c) by comparing\nthe experimental data of $Br(K_L \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-)$ with the theoretical\npredictions one finds the lower bounds on $m_{p1}$ and $m_{p8}$, $m_{p1} \\geq\n210 GeV$ if only the contribution from $\\pi_1$ is taken into account, and\n$m_{p8} \\geq 580 GeV$ for $m_{p1}=210 GeV$, assuming $F_Q=40GeV$; (d) the\nassumed ranges of the masses $m_{p1}$ and $m_{p8}$ in the Multiscale Walking\nTechnicolor Model are excluded by the rare K-decay data.\n", "  In the framework of the paraxial and of the slowly varying envelope\napproximations, with reference to a normally dispersive medium or to vacuum,\nthe electromagnetic field is given as a continuous quantum superposition of\nnon-dispersive and non-diffracting wave-packets (namely X-waves). Entangled\nstates as pairs of elementary excitations traveling at (approximately) the same\nvelocity are found in optical parametric amplification.\n", "  A quantum theory of 3D X-shaped optical bullets in Kerr media is presented.\nThe existence of progressive undistorted squeezed vacuum is predicted.\nApplications to quantum non-demolition experiments, entanglement and\ninterferometers for gravitational waves detection are envisaged.\n"]}
