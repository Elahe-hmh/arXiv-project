In both cases we present explicit\nformulas expressing the short-range correlators in a range of up to seven\nlattice sites in terms of a single function $\\omega$ encoding the dependence of\nthe correlators on $T$ ($L$). These formulas allow us to obtain accurate\nnumerical values for the correlators and derived quantities like the\nentanglement entropy. By calculating the low $T$ (large $L$) asymptotics of\n$\\omega$ we show that the asymptotics of the static correlation functions at\nany finite distance are $T^2$ ($1/L^2$) terms. We obtain exact and explicit\nformulas for the coefficients of the leading order terms for up to eight\nlattice sites.\n", "  The possibility to measure jet-gap-jet final states in\ndouble-Pomeron-exchange events at the LHC is presented. In the context of the\nATLAS experiment with additional forward physics detectors, cross sections for\ndifferent experimental settings and gap definitions are estimated. This is done\nin the framework of the Forward Physics Monte Carlo interfaced with a\nperturbative QCD model that successfully reproduces standard jet-gap-jet cross\nsections at the Tevatron. The extrapolation to LHC energies follows from the\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov dynamics, implemented in the model at\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy.\n", "  The presence of ferroelectricity in hexagonal (h-)InMnO3 has been highly\nunder debate. The results of our comprehensive experiments of low-temperature\n(T) polarization, TEM and HAADF-STEM on well-controlled h-InMnO3 reveal that\nthe ground state is ferroelectric with P6_3cm symmetry, but a non-ferroelectric\nP-3c1 state exists at high T, and can be quenched to room T. We also found that\nthe ferroelectric P6_3cm state of h-InMnO3 exhibits the domain configuration of\ntopological vortices, as has been observed in h-REMnO3 (RE=rare earths).\n", "  The effect of the octahedral tilting of ASnO3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba) parent\ncompound and bi-color ASnO3/BSnO3 superlattice (A, B = Ca, Sr, Ba) was\npredicted from density-functional theory. In the ASnO3 parent compound, the\nstructural phase transition as a function of the A-site cation size was\ncorrelated with the magnitude of the two octahedral tilting modes (a-a-c0\ntilting and a0a0c+ tilting). The magnitude of the octahedral tilting modes in\nthe superlattices was analyzed quantitatively and found to be associated with\nthat of the constituent parent materials. The ASnO3/BSnO3 superlattices showed\nhybrid improper ferroelectricity resulting from the coupling of two octahedral\ntilting modes (a-a-c0 tilting and a0a0c+ tilting), which are also responsible\nfor the structural phase transition from a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase.\nThe ferroelectricity due to A-site mirror symmetry breaking is a secondary\norder parameter for an orthorhombic phase transition in the bi-color\nsuperlattice and is related to the {\\Gamma}5- symmetry mode. The coupling\nbetween the tilting modes and ferroelectric mode in the bi-color superlattice\nof ASnO3/BSnO3 was analyzed by group theory and symmetry mode analysis.\n", "  As large-scale multimode Gaussian states begin to become accessible in the\nlaboratory, their representation and analysis become a useful topic of research\nin their own right. The graphical calculus for Gaussian pure states provides\npowerful tools for their representation, while this work presents a useful tool\nfor their analysis: passive interferometric (i.e., number-conserving)\nsymmetries. Here we show that these symmetries of multimode Gaussian states\nsimplify calculations in measurement-based quantum computing and provide\nconstructive tools for engineering large-scale harmonic systems with specific\nphysical properties, and we provide a general mathematical framework for\nderiving them. Such symmetries are generated by linear combinations of\noperators expressed in the Schwinger representation of U(2), called nullifiers\nbecause the Gaussian state in question is a zero eigenstate of them. This\ngeneral framework is shown to have applications in the noise analysis of\ncontinuous-various cluster states and is expected to have additional\napplications in future work with large-scale multimode Gaussian states.\n", "  Reliable theoretical predictions of noncovalent interaction energies, which\nare important e.g. in drug-design and hydrogen-storage applications, belong to\nlongstanding challenges of contemporary quantum chemistry. In this respect, the\nfixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a promising alternative to the\ncommonly used \"gold standard\" coupled-cluster CCSD(T)/CBS method for its\nbenchmark accuracy and favourable scaling, in contrast to other correlated wave\nfunction approaches. This work is focused on the analysis of protocols and\npossible tradeoffs for FN-DMC estimations of noncovalent interaction energies\nand proposes an efficient yet accurate computational protocol using simplified\nexplicit correlation terms with a favorable O(N^3) scaling. It achieves an\nexcellent agreement (mean unsigned error ~0.2 kcal/mol) with respect to the\nCCSD(T)/CBS data on a number of complexes, including benzene/hydrogen,T-shape\nbenzene dimer, stacked adenine-thymine and a set of small noncovalent complexes\nA24. The high accuracy and reduced computational costs predestinate the\nreported protocol for practical interaction energy calculations of large\nnoncovalent complexes, where the CCSD(T)/CBS is prohibitively expensive.\n", "  Recently a $f(T)$ gravity based on the modification of the teleparallel\ngravity was proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe\nwithout the need of dark energy. We use observational data from Type Ia\nSupernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Cosmic Microwave Background to\nconstrain this $f(T)$ theory and reconstruct the effective equation of state\nand the deceleration parameter. We obtain the best-fit values of parameters and\nfind an interesting result that the $f(T)$ theory considered here allows for\nthe accelerated Hubble expansion to be a transient effect.\n", "  In this paper we look at transmission through one-dimensional potential\nbarriers that are piece wise constant. The Transfer Matrix approach is adopted\nand a new formula is derived for multiplying long matrix sequences that not\nonly leads to an elegant representation of the wave function, but also results\nin much faster computation than earlier methods. The proposed method covers a\nbroad spectrum of potentials of which multi-barrier systems are special cases.\nThe paradigm is exemplified with a finite lattice of non-uniform rectangular\nbarriers - non-uniformity being crucial, as the uniform case has been solved\nexactly by Griffiths and Steinke. For the non-uniform multi-barrier problem,\nthe intervening wells strongly influence the transmission probability.\nSurprisingly, we find that the wells act 'individually', i.e. their influence\nis only a function of their width and is independent of their exact 'location'\nin a multi-barrier system. This leads to a startling observation, which we have\ntermed as the 'Alias Effect.' The exact solutions are supported with asymptotic\nformulas.\n", "  We study a quantum field in elliptic de Sitter space dS_4/Z_2 - the spacetime\nobtained from identifying antipodal points in dS_4. We find that the operator\nalgebra and Hilbert space cannot be defined for the entire space, but only for\nobservable causal patches. This makes the system into an explicit realization\nof the horizon complementarity principle. In the absence of a global quantum\ntheory, we propose a recipe for translating operators and states between\nobservers. This translation involves information loss, in accordance with the\nfact that two observers see different patches of the spacetime. As a check, we\nrecover the thermal state at the de Sitter temperature as a state that appears\nthe same to all observers. This thermal state arises from the same functional\nthat, in ordinary dS_4, describes the Bunch-Davies vacuum.\n", "  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is a form of inseparability in quantum\ntheory commonly acknowledged to be intermediate between entanglement and Bell\nnonlocality. However, this statement has so far only been proven for a\nrestricted class of measurements, namely projective measurements. Here we prove\nthat entanglement, one-way steering, two-way steering and nonlocality are\ngenuinely different considering general measurements, i.e. single round\npositive-operator-valued-measures. Finally, we show that the use of sequences\nof measurements is relevant for steering tests, as they can be used to reveal\n\"hidden steering\".\n", "  A landfill represents a complex and dynamically evolving structure that can\nbe stochastically perturbed by exogenous factors. Both thermodynamic\n(equilibrium) and time varying (non-steady state) properties of a landfill are\naffected by spatially heterogenous and nonlinear subprocesses that combine with\nconstraining initial and boundary conditions arising from the associated\nsurroundings. While multiple approaches have been made to model landfill\nstatistics by incorporating spatially dependent parameters on the one hand\n(data based approach) and continuum dynamical mass-balance equations on the\nother (equation based modelling), practically no attempt has been made to\namalgamate these two approaches while also incorporating inherent\nstochastically induced fluctuations affecting the process overall. In this\narticle, we will implement a minimalist scheme of modelling the time evolution\nof a realistic three dimensional landfill through a reaction-diffusion based\napproach, focusing on the coupled interactions of four key variables - solid\nmass density, hydrolysed mass density, acetogenic mass density and methanogenic\nmass density. In a marked departure from previous predictions, our results\nindicate that close to the linearly stable limit, the large time steady state\nproperties, arising out of a series of complex coupled interactions between the\nstochastically driven variables, are scarcely affected by the biochemical\ngrowth-decay statistics. Our results clearly show that an equilibrium landfill\nstructure relates to plant production times of approximately 20-30 years\ninstead of the previous (incorrect) deterministic model predictions of 50 years\nand above.\n", "  In this paper we generalize the spin-raising and lowering operators of\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics to linear-in-$\\gamma$ spin-weighted\nspheroidal harmonics where $\\gamma$ is an additional parameter present in the\nsecond order ordinary differential equation governing these harmonics. One can\nthen generalize these operators to higher powers in $\\gamma$. Constructing\nthese operators required calculating the $\\ell$-, $s$- and $m$-raising and\nlowering operators (and various combinations of them) of spin-weighted\nspherical harmonics which have been calculated and shown explicitly in this\npaper.\n", "  Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI) can be viewed as a statement of\nconcavity of an entropic function of a continuous random variable under a\nscaled addition rule: $$f(\\sqrt{a}\\,X + \\sqrt{1-a}\\,Y) \\ge a f(X) + (1-a) f(Y)\n\\quad \\forall \\, a \\in [0,1].$$ Here, $X$ and $Y$ are continuous random\nvariables and the function $f$ is either the differential entropy or the\nentropy power. K\\\"onig and Smith [arXiv:1205.3409] and De Palma, Mari, and\nGiovannetti [arXiv:1402.0404] obtained quantum analogues of these inequalities\nfor continuous-variable quantum systems, where $X$ and $Y$ are replaced by\nbosonic fields and the addition rule is the action of a beamsplitter with\ntransmissivity $a$ on those fields. In this paper, we similarly establish a\nclass of EPI analogues for $d$-level quantum systems (i.e. qudits). The\nunderlying addition rule for which these inequalities hold is given by a\nquantum channel that depends on the parameter $a \\in [0,1]$ and acts like a\nfinite-dimensional analogue of a beamsplitter with transmissivity $a$,\nconverting a two-qudit product state into a single qudit state. We refer to\nthis channel as a partial swap channel because of the particular way its output\ninterpolates between the states of the two qudits in the input as $a$ is\nchanged from zero to one. We obtain analogues of Shannon's EPI, not only for\nthe von Neumann entropy and the entropy power for the output of such channels,\nbut for a much larger class of functions as well. This class includes the\nR\\'enyi entropies and the subentropy. We also prove a qudit analogue of the\nentropy photon number inequality (EPnI). Finally, for the subclass of partial\nswap channels for which one of the qudit states in the input is fixed, our EPIs\nand EPnI yield lower bounds on the minimum output entropy and upper bounds on\nthe Holevo capacity.\n", "  The main parts of the LHC diffractive physics programme possible to be\nmeasured using a proton tagging technique are presented. The geometric\nacceptance of the ATLAS forward proton detectors: ALFA and AFP for various LHC\noptics settings are shown. The probabilities of observing a proton originating\nfrom a minimum-bias event in ALFA and AFP stations are given. The main\nproperties of single diffractive and double Pomeron exchange production of\ndijets, photon+jet, jet-gap-jet and W/Z bosons are discussed. The possibility\nof measuring the jet production in exclusive (double proton tag) and\nsemi-exclusive (single tag) mode is evaluated.\n", "  Aubry-Andre Harper (AAH) lattice models, characterized by\nreflection-asymmetric, sinusoidally varying nearest-neighbor tunneling profile,\nare well-known for their topological properties. We consider the fate of such\nmodels in the presence of balanced gain and loss potentials $\\pm i\\gamma$\nlocated at reflection-symmetric sites. We predict that these models have a\nfinite $\\mathcal{PT}$ breaking threshold only for {\\it specific locations} of\nthe gain-loss potential, and uncover a hidden symmetry that is instrumental to\nthe finite threshold strength. We also show that the topological edge-states\nremain robust in the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase. Our predictions\nsubstantially broaden the possible realizations of a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\nsystem.\n", "  Results are presented from a phenomenological analysis of recent measurements\nof jet suppression and modifications of jet fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the LHC. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the\ndifferences between quark and gluon jet quenching on the transverse momentum\n($p_{T}^{jet}$) dependence of the jet $R_{AA}$ and on the fragmentation\nfunctions, $D(z)$. Primordial quark and gluon parton distributions were\nobtained from PYTHIA8 and were parameterized using simple power-law functions\nand extensions to the power-law function which were found to better describe\nthe PYTHIA8 parton spectra. A simple model for the quark energy loss based on\nthe shift formalism is used to model $R_{AA}$ and $D(z)$ using both analytic\nresults and using direct Monte-Carlo sampling of the PYTHIA parton spectra. The\nmodel is capable of describing the full $p_{T}^{jet}$ , rapidity, and\ncentrality dependence of the measured jet $R_{AA}$ using three effective\nparameters. A key result from the analysis is that the $D(z)$ modifications\nobserved in the data, excluding the enhancement at low-$z$, may result\nprimarily from the different quenching of the quarks and gluons. The model is\nalso capable of reproducing the charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse\nmomentum. Predictions are made for the jet $R_{AA}$ at large rapidities where\nit has not yet been measured and for the rapidity dependence of $D(z)$.\n", "  Micromechanical transducers such as cantilevers for AFM often rely on optical\nreadout methods that require illumination of a specific region of the\nmicrostructure. Here we explore and exploit the diffraction effects that have\nbeen previously neglected when modeling cantilever bending measurement\ntechniques. The illumination of a cantilever end causes an asymmetric\ndiffraction pattern at the photodetector that significantly affects the\ncalibration of the signal in the popular optical beam deflection technique\n(OBDT). Conditions for optimized linear signals that avoid detection artifacts\nconflict with small numerical aperture illumination and narrow cantilevers\nwhich are softer and therefore more sensitive. Embracing diffraction patterns\nas a physical measurable allows a richer detection technique that decouples\nmeasurements of tilt and curvature and simultaneously relaxes the requirements\non the alignment of illumination and detector. We show analytical results,\nnumerical simulations and physiologically relevant experimental data\ndemonstrating the usefulness of these diffraction features. We offer\nexperimental design guidelines and identify and quantify possible sources of\nsystematic error of up to 10% in OBDT. We demonstrate a new nanometre\nresolution detection method that can replace OBDT, where Frauenhofer and Bragg\ndiffraction effects from finite sized and patterned cantilevers are exploited.\nSuch effects are readily generalized to arrays, and allow transmission\ndetection of mechanical curvature, enabling in-line instruments. In particular,\na cantilever with a periodic array of slots produces Bragg peaks which can be\nanalyzed to deduce the cantilever curvature. We highlight the comparative\nadvantages over OBDT by detecting molecular activity of antibiotic Vancomycin,\nwith an RMS noise equivalent to less than $2.5 \\mu M$ (1.5 nm), as example of\npossible multi-maker bio-assays.\n", "  We present a closed bouncing universe model where the value of coupling\nconstants is set by the dynamics of a ghost-like dilatonic scalar field. We\nshow that adding a periodic potential for the scalar field leads to a cyclic\nFriedmann universe where the values of the couplings vary randomly from one\ncycle to the next. While the shuffling of values for the couplings happens\nduring the bounce, within each cycle their time-dependence remains safely\nwithin present observational bounds for physically-motivated values of the\nmodel parameters. Our model presents an alternative to solutions of the fine\ntuning problem based on string landscape scenarios.\n", "  Modern theories of the hydrophobic effect highlight its dependence on length\nscale, emphasizing in particular the importance of interfaces that emerge in\nthe vicinity of sizable hydrophobes. We recently showed that a faithful\ntreatment of such nanoscale interfaces requires careful attention to the\nstatistics of capillary waves, with significant quantitative implications for\nthe calculation of solvation thermodynamics. Here we show that a coarse-grained\nlattice model in the spirit of those pioneered by Chandler and coworkers, when\ninformed by this understanding, can capture a broad range of hydrophobic\nbehaviors with striking accuracy. Specifically, we calculate probability\ndistributions for microscopic density fluctuations that agree very well with\nresults of atomistic simulations, even many standard deviations from the mean,\nand even for probe volumes in highly heterogeneous environments. This accuracy\nis achieved without adjustment of free parameters, as the model is fully\nspecified by well-known properties of liquid water. As illustrative examples of\nits utility, we characterize the free energy profile for a solute crossing the\nair-water interface, and compute the thermodynamic cost of evacuating the space\nbetween extended nanoscale surfaces. Together, these calculations suggest that\na highly reduced model for aqueous solvation can serve as the basis for\nefficient multiscale modeling of spatial organization driven by hydrophobic and\ninterfacial forces.\n", "  Scale invariant theories are often used to address the hierarchy problem,\nhowever the regularization of their quantum corrections introduces a\ndimensionful coupling (dimensional regularization) or scale (Pauli-Villars,\netc) which break this symmetry explicitly. We show how to avoid this problem\nand study the implications of a manifestly scale invariant regularization in\n(classical) scale invariant theories. We use a dilaton-dependent subtraction\nfunction $\\mu(\\sigma)$ which after spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry\ngenerates the usual DR subtraction scale $\\mu(\\langle\\sigma\\rangle)$. One\nconsequence is that \"evanescent\" interactions generated by scale invariance of\nthe action in $d=4-2\\epsilon$ (but vanishing in $d=4$), give rise to new,\nfinite quantum corrections. We find a (finite) correction $\\Delta\nU(\\phi,\\sigma)$ to the one-loop scalar potential for $\\phi$ and $\\sigma$,\nbeyond the Coleman-Weinberg term. $\\Delta U$ is due to an evanescent correction\n($\\propto\\epsilon$) to the field-dependent masses (of the states in the loop)\nwhich multiplies the pole ($\\propto 1/\\epsilon$) of the momentum integral, to\ngive a finite quantum result. $\\Delta U$ contains a non-polynomial operator\n$\\sim \\phi^6/\\sigma^2$ of known coefficient and is independent of the\nsubtraction dimensionless parameter. A more general $\\mu(\\phi,\\sigma)$ is ruled\nout since, in their classical decoupling limit, the visible sector (of the\nhiggs $\\phi$) and hidden sector (dilaton $\\sigma$) still interact at the\nquantum level, thus the subtraction function must depend on the dilaton only.\nThe method is useful in models where preserving scale symmetry at quantum level\nis important.\n", "  The levels in 26Na with single particle character have been observed for the\nfirst time using the d(25Na,p gamma) reaction at 5 MeV/nucleon. The measured\nexcitation energies and the deduced spectroscopic factors are in good overall\nagreement with (0+1) hbar-omega shell model calculations performed in a\ncomplete spsdfp basis and incorporating a reduction in the N=20 gap. Notably,\nthe 1p3/2 neutron configuration was found to play an enhanced role in the\nstructure of the low-lying negative parity states in 26Na, compared to the\nisotone 28Al. Thus, the lowering of the 1p3/2 orbital relative to the 0f7/2\noccurring in the neighbouring Z=10 and 12 nuclei -- 25,27Ne and 27,29Mg -- is\nseen also to occur at Z=11 and further strengthens the constraints on the\nmodelling of the transition into the island of inversion.\n", "  Quantum theory expresses the observable relations between physical properties\nin terms of probabilities that depend on the specific context described by the\n\"state\" of a system. However, the laws of physics that emerge at the\nmacroscopic level are fully deterministic. Here, it is shown that the relation\nbetween quantum statistics and deterministic dynamics can be explained in terms\nof ergodic averages over complex valued probabilities, where the fundamental\ncausality of motion is expressed by an action that appears as the phase of the\ncomplex probability multiplied with the fundamental constant hbar. Importantly,\nclassical physics emerges as an approximation of this more fundamental theory\nof motion, indicating that the assumption of a classical reality described by\ndifferential geometry is merely an artefact of an extrapolation from the\nobservation of macroscopic dynamics to a fictitious level of precision that\ndoes not exist within our actual experience of the world around us. It is\ntherefore possible to completely replace the classical concepts of trajectories\nwith the more fundamental concept of action phase probabilities as a\nuniversally valid description of the deterministic causality of motion that is\nobserved in the physical world.\n", "  The presence of 2D electron gases at surfaces or interfaces in oxide thin\nfilms remains a hot topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, BaBiO3\nappears as a very interesting system as it was theoretically proposed that its\n(001) surface should become metallic if a Bi-termination is achieved (Vildosola\net al., PRL 110, 206805 (2013)). Here we report on the preparation by pulsed\nlaser deposition and characterization of BaBiO3 thin films on silicon. We show\nthat the texture of the films can be tuned by controlling the growth\nconditions, being possible to stabilize strongly (100)-textured films. We find\nsignificant differences on the spectroscopic and transport properties between\n(100)-textured and non-textured films. We rationalize these experimental\nresults by performing first principles calculations, which indicate the\nexistence of electron doping at the (100) surface. This stabilizes Bi ions in a\n3+ state, shortens Bi-O bonds and reduces the electronic band gap, increasing\nthe surface conductivity. Our results emphasize the importance of surface\neffects on the electronic properties of perovskites, and provide strategies to\ndesign novel oxide heterostructures with potential interface-related 2D\nelectron gases.\n", "  We obtain a (5+1)-dimensional global flat embedding of modified Schwarzschild\nblack hole in rainbow gravity. We show that local free-fall temperature in\nrainbow gravity, which depends on different energy $\\omega$ of a test particle,\nis finite at the event horizon for a freely falling observer, while local\ntemperature is divergent at the event horizon for a fiducial observer.\nMoreover, these temperatures in rainbow gravity satisfy similar relations to\nthose of the Schwarzschild black hole except overall factor $g(\\omega)$, which\nplays a key role of rainbow functions in this embedding approach.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation $-f\"+q_\\kappa f = Ef$\non the positive half-axis with the potential\n$q_\\kappa(r)=(\\kappa^2-1/4)r^{-2}$. For each complex number $\\vartheta$, we\nconstruct a solution $u^\\kappa_\\vartheta(E)$ of this equation that is analytic\nin $\\kappa$ in a complex neighborhood of the interval $(-1,1)$ and, in\nparticular, at the \"singular\" point $\\kappa = 0$. For $-1<\\kappa<1$ and real\n$\\vartheta$, the solutions $u^\\kappa_\\vartheta(E)$ determine a unitary\neigenfunction expansion operator $U_{\\kappa,\\vartheta}\\colon L_2(0,\\infty)\\to\nL_2(\\mathbb R,\\mathcal V_{\\kappa,\\vartheta})$, where $\\mathcal\nV_{\\kappa,\\vartheta}$ is a positive measure on $\\mathbb R$. We show that every\nself-adjoint realization of the formal differential expression $-\\partial^2_r +\nq_\\kappa(r)$ for the Hamiltonian is diagonalized by the operator\n$U_{\\kappa,\\vartheta}$ for some $\\vartheta\\in\\mathbb R$. Using suitable\nsingular Titchmarsh-Weyl $m$-functions, we explicitly find the measures\n$\\mathcal V_{\\kappa,\\vartheta}$ and prove their continuity in $\\kappa$ and\n$\\vartheta$.\n", "  Superspace is considered as space of parameters of the supercoherent states\ndefining the basis for oscillator-like unitary irreducible representations of\nthe generalized superconformal group SU(2m,2n/2N) in the field of quaternions\nH. The specific construction contains naturally the supertwistor one of the\nprevious work by Litov and Pervushin [1] and it is shown that in the case of\nextended supersymmetry such an approach leads to the separation of a class of\nsuperspaces and and its groups of motion. We briefly discuss this particular\nextension to the domain of quaternionic superspaces as nonlinear realization of\nsome kind of the affine and the superconformal groups with the final end to\ninclude also the gravitational field[6] (this last possibility to include\ngravitation, can be realized on the basis of the reference[12] where the coset\n((Sp(8))/(SL(4R)))~((SU(2,2))/(SL(2C)))was used in the non supersymmetric\ncase). It is shown that this quaternionic construction avoid some\nunconsistencies appearing at the level of the generators of the superalgebras\n(for specific values of p and q; p+q=N) in the twistor one.\n", "  We present an exact quantization condition for the time independent solutions\n(energy eigenstates) of the one-dimensional Dirac equation with a scalar\npotential well that gives only two `effective' turning points (defined by the\nroots of $V(x)+mc^2=\\pm E$) for a given energy $E$ and satisfies $\\min\nV(x)+mc^2\\geq 0$. This result generalizes the previously known non-relativistic\nquantization formula and preserves many physically desirable symmetries,\nbesides, attaining the correct non-relativistic limit. Numerical calculations\ndemonstrate the utility of the formula for computing accurate energy\neigenvalues.\n", "  Differential force measurements between spheres coated with either nickel or\ngold and rotating disks with periodic distributions of nickel and gold are\nreported. The rotating samples are covered by a thin layer of titanium and a\nlayer of gold. While titanium is used for fabrication purposes, the gold layer\n(nominal thicknesses of 21, 37, 47 and 87 nm) provides an isoelectronic\nenvironment, and is used to nullify the electrostatic contribution but allow\nthe passage of long wavelength Casimir photons. A direct comparison between the\nexperimental results and predictions from Drude and plasma models for the\nelectrical permittivity is carried out. In the models the magnetic permeability\nof nickel is allowed to change to investigate its effects. Possible sources of\nerrors, both in the experimental and theoretical sides, are taken into account.\nIt is found that a Drude response with magnetic properties of nickel taken into\naccount is unequivocally ruled out. The full analysis of the data indicates\nthat a dielectric plasma response with magnetic properties of Ni included shows\ngood agreement with the data. Neither a Drude nor a plasma dielectric response\nprovide a satisfactory description if the magnetic properties of nickel are\ndisregarded.\n", "  Faint red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey show a puzzling clustering\npattern in previous measurements. In the two-point correlation function (2PCF),\nthey appear to be strongly clustered on small-scales, indicating a tendency to\nreside in massive haloes as satellite galaxies. However, their weak clustering\non large scales suggests that they are more likely to be found in low mass\nhaloes. The interpretation of the clustering pattern suffers from the large\nsample variance in the 2PCF measurements, given the small volume of the\nvolume-limited sample of such faint galaxies. We introduce a method to improve\nthe clustering measurements of faint galaxies by making a full use of a\nflux-limited sample to obtain volume-limited measurements with an increased\neffective volume. In the improved 2PCF measurements, the fractional\nuncertainties on large-scales drop by more than 40 per cent, and the strong\ncontrast between small-scale and large-scale clustering amplitudes seen in\nprevious work is no longer prominent. From halo occupation distribution\nmodelling of the measurements, we find that a considerable fraction of faint\nred galaxies to be satellites in massive haloes, a senario supported by the\nstrong covariance of small-scale 2PCF measurements and the relative spatial\ndistribution of faint red galaxies and luminous galaxies. However, the\nsatellite fraction is found to be degenerate with the slope of the distribution\nprofile of satellites in inner haloes. We compare the modelling results with\nsemi-analytic model predictions and discuss the implications.\n", "  We study the geometrical properties of null congruences generated by an\naligned null direction of the Weyl tensor (WAND) in spacetimes of the Weyl and\nRicci type N (possibly with a non-vanishing cosmological constant) in an\narbitrary dimension. We prove that a type N Ricci tensor and a type III or N\nWeyl tensor have to be aligned. In such spacetimes, the multiple WAND has to be\ngeodetic. For spacetimes with type N aligned Weyl and Ricci tensors, the\ncanonical form of the optical matrix in the twisting and non-twisting case is\nderived and the dependence of the Weyl and the Ricci tensors and Ricci rotation\ncoefficients on the affine parameter of the geodetic null congruence generated\nby the WAND is obtained.\n", "  This work revisits the classical concept of electric energy and suggests that\nthe common definition is likely to generate large errors when dealing with\nnanostructures. For instance, deriving the electrostatic energy in\nsemiconductors using the traditional formula fails at giving the correct\nelectrostatic force between capacitor plates and reveals the existence of an\nextra contribution to the standard electrostatic energy. This additional energy\nis found to proceed from the generation of space charge regions which are\npredicted when combining electrostatics laws with semiconductor statistics,\nsuch as for accumulation and inversion layers. On the contrary, no such energy\nexists when relying on electrostatics only, as for instance when adopting the\nso-called full depletion approximation. The same holds for charged or neutral\ninsulators that are still consistent with the customary definition, but which\nare in fact singular cases. In semiconductors, this additional free energy can\nlargely exceed the energy gained by the dipoles, thus becoming the dominant\nterm. Consequently, erroneous electrostatic forces in nanostructure systems\nsuch as for MEMS and NEMS as well as incorrect energy calculations are expected\nusing the standard definition. This unexpected result clearly asks for a\ngeneralization of electrostatic energy in matter in order to reconcile basic\nconcepts and to prevent flawed force evaluation in nanostructures with\nelectrical charges.\n", "  The observation of quantum nonlocality, i.e. quantum correlations violating a\nBell inequality, implies the use of incompatible local quantum measurements.\nHere we consider the converse question. That is, can any set of incompatible\nmeasurements be used in order to demonstrate Bell inequality violation? Our\nmain result is to construct a local hidden variable model for an incompatible\nset of qubit measurements. Specifically, we show that if Alice uses this set of\nmeasurements, then for any possible shared entangled state, and any possible\ndichotomic measurements performed by Bob, the resulting statistics are local.\nThis represents significant progress towards proving that measurement\nincompatibility does not imply Bell nonlocality in general.\n", "  Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that combines encoding with\nenergy penalties and decoding to suppress and correct errors that degrade the\nperformance of quantum annealers in solving optimization problems. While QAC\nhas been experimentally demonstrated to successfully error-correct a range of\noptimization problems, a clear understanding of its operating mechanism has\nbeen lacking. Here we bridge this gap using tools from quantum statistical\nmechanics. We study analytically tractable models using a mean-field analysis,\nspecifically the $p$-body ferromagnetic infinite-range transverse-field Ising\nmodel as well as the quantum Hopfield model. We demonstrate that for $p=2$,\nwhere the phase transition is of second order, QAC pushes the transition to\nincreasingly larger transverse field strengths. For $p\\ge3$, where the phase\ntransition is of first order, QAC softens the closing of the gap for small\nenergy penalty values and prevents its closure for sufficiently large energy\npenalty values. Thus QAC provides protection from excitations that occur near\nthe quantum critical point. We find similar results for the Hopfield model,\nthus demonstrating that our conclusions hold in the presence of disorder.\n", "  Gravitational waves from coalescences of neutron stars or stellar-mass black\nholes into intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of $\\gtrsim 100$ solar masses\nrepresent one of the exciting possible sources for advanced gravitational-wave\ndetectors. These sources can provide definitive evidence for the existence of\nIMBHs, probe globular-cluster dynamics, and potentially serve as tests of\ngeneral relativity. We analyse the accuracy with which we can measure the\nmasses and spins of the IMBH and its companion in intermediate-mass ratio\ncoalescences. We find that we can identify an IMBH with a mass above $100 ~\nM_\\odot$ with $95\\%$ confidence provided the massive body exceeds $130 ~\nM_\\odot$. For source masses above $\\sim200 ~ M_\\odot$, the best measured\nparameter is the frequency of the quasi-normal ringdown. Consequently, the\ntotal mass is measured better than the chirp mass for massive binaries, but the\ntotal mass is still partly degenerate with spin, which cannot be accurately\nmeasured. Low-frequency detector sensitivity is particularly important for\nmassive sources, since sensitivity to the inspiral phase is critical for\nmeasuring the mass of the stellar-mass companion. We show that we can\naccurately infer source parameters for cosmologically redshifted signals by\napplying appropriate corrections. We investigate the impact of uncertainty in\nthe model gravitational waveforms and conclude that our main results are likely\nrobust to systematics.\n", "  We present quantum fidelity benchmarks for continuous-variable (CV) quantum\ndevices to outperform quantum channels which can transmit at most\n$k$-dimensional coherences for positive integers $k$. We determine an upper\nbound of an average fidelity over Gaussian distributed coherent states for\nquantum channels whose Schmidt class is $k$. This settles fundamental fidelity\nsteps where the known classical limit and quantum limit correspond to the two\nendpoints of $k=1$ and $k= \\infty $, respectively. It turns out that the\naverage fidelity is useful to verify to what extent an experimental CV gate can\ntransmit a high dimensional coherence. The result is also extended to be\napplicable to general quantum operations. While the fidelity is directly\nassociated with heterodyne measurements in quantum optics, we can also obtain\nsimilar criteria based on mean square quadrature deviations via homodyne\nmeasurements.\n", "  Mechanical deformation of nanopillars displays features that are distinctly\ndifferent from the bulk behavior of single crystals: Yield strength increases\nwith decreasing size and plastic deformation comes together with strain bursts\nor/and stress drops (depending on loading conditions) with a very strong\nsensitivity of the stochasticity character on material preparation and\nconditions. The character of the phenomenon is standing as a paradox: While\nthese bursts resemble the universal, widely independent of material conditions,\nnoise heard in bulk crystals using acoustic emission (AE) techniques, they\nstrongly emerge primarily with decreasing size and increasing strength in\nnanopillars. In this paper, we present a realistic but minimal discrete\ndislocation plasticity model for the elasto-plastic deformation of nanopillars\nthat is consistent with the main experimental observations of nano pillar\ncompression experiments and provides a clear insight to this paradox. With\nincreasing sample size, the model naturally transitions between the typical\nprogressive behavior of nanopillars to a behavior that resembles evidence for\nbulk mesoscale plasticity. The combination of consistent strengthening, large\nflow stress fluctuations and critical avalanches is only observed in the {\\it\ndepinning regime} where obstacles are much stronger than dislocation sources;\nin contrast, when dislocation source strength becomes comparable to obstacle\nbarriers, then yield strength size effects are absent but plasticity avalanche\ndynamics is strongly universal, across sample width and aspect-ratio scales.\nFinally, we elucidate the mechanism that leads to the connection between\ndepinning and size effects in our model dislocation dynamics. In this way, our\nmodel builds a way towards unifying statistical aspects of mechanical\ndeformation across scales.\n", "  We numerically investigate the generation of solitons in current-biased long\nJosephson junctions in relation to the superconducting lifetime and the voltage\ndrop across the device. The dynamics of the junction is modelled with a\nsine-Gordon equation driven by an oscillating field and subject to an external\nnon-Gaussian noise. A wide range of $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy distributions is\nconsidered as noise source, with varying stability index $\\alpha$ and asymmetry\nparameter $\\beta$. In junctions longer than a critical length, the mean\nswitching time (MST) from superconductive to the resistive state assumes a\nvalues independent of the device length. Here, we demonstrate that such a value\nis directly related to the mean density of solitons which move into or from the\nwashboard potential minimum corresponding to the initial superconductive state.\nMoreover, we observe: (i) a connection between the total mean soliton density\nand the mean potential difference across the junction; (ii) an inverse behavior\nof the mean voltage in comparison with the MST, with varying the junction\nlength; (iii) evidences of non-monotonic behaviors, such as stochastic resonant\nactivation and noise enhanced stability, of MST versus the driving frequency\nand noise intensity for different values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$; (iv) finally,\nthese non-monotonic behaviors are found to be related to the mean density of\nsolitons formed along the junction.\n", "  What are the mechanisms of particle acceleration and radiation, as well as\nmagnetic field build up and decay in relativistic shocks are open questions\nwith important implications to various phenomena in high energy astrophysics.\nWhile the Weibel instability is possibly responsible for magnetic field build\nup and diffusive shock acceleration is a model for acceleration, both have\nproblems and current PIC simulation show that particles are accelerated only\nunder special conditions and the magnetic field decays on a short length scale.\nWe present here a novel model for the structure and the emission of highly\nrelativistic collisionless shocks. The model takes into account (and is based\non) non-local energy and momentum transport across the shock front via emission\nand absorption of high-energy photons. This leads to a pre-acceleration of the\nfluid and pre-amplificaiton of the magnetic fields in the upstream region. Both\nhave drastic implications on the shock structure. The model explains the\npersistence of the shock generated magnetic field at large distances from the\nshock front. The dissipation of this magnetic field results in a continuous\nparticle acceleration within the downstream region. The model suggests two\nnon-uniform emission zones (the downstream and the upstream), that give rise to\nthree emission components with different spectral and temporal properties. A\nunique feature of the model is the existence of an \"attractor\", toward which\nany shock will evolve. This enables us to estimate from first principles the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton spectrum of the downstream emission. The model\nis applicable to any relativistic shock, but its distinctive features show up\nonly for large compactness. We demonstrate that prompt and afterglow Gamma-Ray\nBursts' shocks satisfy the relevant conditions and compare their observations\nwith the predictions.\n", "  We derive an explicit mapping between the spectra of conserved local\noperators of integrable quantum lattice models and the density distributions of\ntheir thermodynamic particle content. This is presented explicitly for the\nHeisenberg XXZ spin chain. As an application we discuss a quantum quench\nscenario, in both the gapped and critical regimes. We outline an exact\ntechnique which allows for an efficient implementation on periodic matrix\nproduct states. In addition, for certain simple product states we obtain\nanalytic closed-form expressions in terms of solutions to Hirota functional\nrelations. Remarkably, no reference to a maximal entropy principle is invoked.\n", "  Energy deposition by active galactic nuclei jets into the ambient medium can\naffect galaxy formation and evolution, the cooling of gas flows at the centres\nof galaxy clusters, and the growth of the supermassive black holes. However,\nthe processes that couple jet power to the ambient medium and determine jet\nmorphology are poorly understood. For instance, there is no agreement on the\ncause of the well-known Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological dichotomy of jets,\nwith FRI jets being shorter and less stable than FRII jets. We carry out global\n3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets propagating through the\nambient medium. We show that the flat density profiles of galactic cores slow\ndown and collimate the jets, making them susceptible to the 3D magnetic kink\ninstability. We obtain a critical power, which depends on the galaxy core mass\nand radius, below which jets become kink-unstable within the core, stall, and\ninflate cavities filled with relativistically-hot plasma. Jets above the\ncritical power stably escape the core and form powerful backflows. Thus, the\nkink instability controls the jet morphology and can lead to the FR dichotomy.\nThe model-predicted dependence of the critical power on the galaxy optical\nluminosity agrees well with observations.\n", "  Milz and Strunz ({\\it J. Phys. A}: {\\bf{48}} [2015] 035306) recently studied\nthe probabilities that two-qubit and qubit-qutrit states, randomly generated\nwith respect to Hilbert-Schmidt (Euclidean/flat) measure, are separable. They\nconcluded that in both cases, the separability probabilities (apparently\nexactly $\\frac{8}{33}$ in the two-qubit scenario) hold {\\it constant} over the\nBloch radii ($r$) of the single-qubit subsystems, jumping to 1 at the pure\nstate boundaries ($r=1$). Here, firstly, we present evidence that in the\nqubit-qutrit case, the separability probability is uniformly distributed, as\nwell, over the {\\it generalized} Bloch radius ($R$) of the qutrit subsystem.\nWhile the qubit (standard) Bloch vector is positioned in three-dimensional\nspace, the qutrit generalized Bloch vector lives in eight-dimensional space.\nThe radii variables $r$ and $R$ themselves are the lengths/norms (being square\nroots of {\\it quadratic} Casimir invariants) of these (\"coherence\") vectors.\nAdditionally, we find that not only are the qubit-qutrit separability\nprobabilities invariant over the quadratic Casimir invariant of the qutrit\nsubsystem, but apparently also over the {\\it cubic} one--and similarly the\ncase, more generally, with the use of random induced measure. We also\ninvestigate two-qutrit ($3 \\times 3$) and qubit-{\\it qudit} ($2 \\times 4$)\nsystems--with seemingly analogous {\\it positive-partial-transpose}-probability\ninvariances holding over what have been termed by Altafini, the {\\it partial}\nCasimir invariants of these systems.\n", "  In the analogue gravity framework, the acoustic disturbances in a moving\nfluid can be described by an equation of motion identical to a relativistic\nscalar massless field propagating in a curved spacetime. This description is\npossible only when the fluid under consideration is barotropic, inviscid and\nirrotational. In this case, the propagation of the perturbations is governed by\nan acoustic metric which depends algebrically on the local speed of sound,\ndensity and the background flow velocity, the latter assumed to be vorticity\nfree. In this work we provide an straightforward extension in order to go\nbeyond the irrotational constraint. Using a charged --- relativistic and\nnon-relativistic --- Bose--Einstein condensate as a physical system, we show\nthat in the low momentum limit and performing the eikonal approximation we can\nderive a d'Alembertian equation of motion for the charged phonons where the\nemergent acoustic metric depends on a flow velocity in the presence of\nvorticity.\n", "  A novel promising route for creating topological states and excitations is to\ncombine superconductivity and the quantum Hall (QH) effect. Despite this\npotential, signatures of superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime remain\nscarce, and a superconducting current through a QH weak link has so far eluded\nexperimental observation. Here we demonstrate the existence of a new type of\nsupercurrent-carrying states in a QH region at magnetic fields as high as\n2Tesla. The observation of supercurrent in the quantum Hall regime marks an\nimportant step in the quest for exotic topological excitations such as Majorana\nfermions and parafermions, which may find applications in fault-tolerant\nquantum computations.\n", "  In this paper we consider a three-state variant of the BB84 quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) protocol. We derive a new lower-bound on the key rate of\nthis protocol in the asymptotic scenario and use mismatched measurement\noutcomes to improve the channel estimation. Our new key rate bound remains\npositive up to an error rate of $11\\%$, exactly that achieved by the four-state\nBB84 protocol.\n", "  We overview the main features of mobile impurities moving in one-dimensional\nsuperfluid backgrounds by modeling it as a mobile Josephson junction, which\nleads naturally to the periodic dispersion of the impurity. The dissipation\nprocesses, such as radiative friction and quantum viscosity, are shown to\nresult from the interaction of the collective phase difference with the\nbackground phonons. We develop a more realistic depleton model of an\nimpurity-hole bound state that provides a number of exact results interpolating\nbetween the semiclassical weakly-interacting picture and the strongly\ninteracting Tonks-Girardeau regime. We also discuss the physics of a trapped\nimpurity, relevant to current experiments with ultra cold atoms.\n", "  We provide a generic scheme offering real time control of directed particle\ntransport in superimposed driven lattices. This scheme allows to accelerate,\nslow and freeze the transport on demand, by switching one of the lattices\nsubsequently on and off. The underlying physical mechanism hinges on a\nsystematic opening and closing of channels between transporting and\nnon-transporting phase space structures upon switching, and exploits cantori\nstructures which generate memory effects in the population of these structures.\nOur results should allow for real time control of cold thermal atomic ensembles\nin optical lattices, but might also be useful as a design principle for\ntargeted delivery of molecules or colloids in optical devices.\n", "  A measurement of the vector to pseudoscalar conversion decay $\\phi \\to \\pi^0\ne^+e^-$ with the KLOE experiment is presented. A sample of $\\sim 9500$ signal\nevents was selected from a data set of 1.7 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} \\sim m_{\\phi}$ collected at the DA$\\Phi$NE $e^+e^-$ collider. These\nevents were used to obtain the first measurement of the transition form factor\n$| F_{\\phi \\pi^0}(q^2) |$ and a new measurement of the branching ratio of the\ndecay: $\\rm{BR}\\,(\\phi \\to \\pi^0 e^+e^-) = (\\,1.35 \\pm\n0.05^{\\,\\,+0.05}_{\\,\\,-0.10}\\,) \\times 10 ^{-5}$. The result improves\nsignificantly on previous measurements and is in agreement with theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  We make use of a simple pair correlated wave function approach to obtain\nresults for the ground-state densities and momentum distribution of a\none-dimensional three-body bosonic system with different interactions in a\nharmonic trap. For equal interactions this approach is able to reproduce the\nknown analytical cases of zero and infinite repulsion. We show that our results\nfor the correlations agree with the exact diagonalization in all interaction\nregimes and with analytical results for the strongly repulsive impurity. This\nmethod also enables us to access the more complicated cases of mixed\ninteractions, and the probability densities of these systems are analyzed.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are highly mobile nanoscale topological spin textures. We\nshow, both analytically and numerically, that a magnetic skyrmion of an even\nazimuthal winding number placed in proximity to an s-wave superconductor hosts\na zero-energy Majorana bound state in its core, when the exchange coupling\nbetween the itinerant electrons and the skyrmion is strong. This Majorana bound\nstate is stabilized by the presence of a spin-orbit interaction. We propose the\nuse of a superconducting tri-junction to realize non-Abelian statistics of such\nMajorana bound states.\n", "  The hydrogen-bond network of water is characterized by the presence of\ncoordination defects relative to the ideal tetrahedral network of ice, whose\nfluctuations determine the static and time-dependent properties of the liquid.\nBecause of topological constraints, such defects do not come alone, but are\nhighly correlated coming in a plethora of different pairs. Here we discuss in\ndetail such correlations in the case of ab initio water models and show that\nthey have interesting similarities to regular and defective solid phases of\nwater. Although defect correlations involve deviations from idealized\ntetrahedrality, they can still be regarded as weaker hydrogen bonds that retain\na high degree of directionality. We also investigate how the structure and\npopulation of coordination defects is affected by approximations to the\ninter-atomic potential, finding that in most cases, the qualitative features of\nthe hydrogen bond network are remarkably robust.\n", "  Materials that undergo reversible metal-insulator transitions are obvious\ncandidates for new generations of devices. For such potential to be realised,\nthe underlying microscopic mechanisms of such transitions must be fully\ndetermined. In this work we probe the correlation between the energy landscape\nand electronic structure of the metal-insulator transition of vanadium dioxide\nand the atomic motions occurring using first principles calculations and high\nresolution X-ray diffraction. Calculations find an energy barrier between the\nhigh and low temperature phases corresponding to contraction followed by\nexpansion of the distances between vanadium atoms on neighbouring sub-lattices.\nX-ray diffraction reveals anisotropic strain broadening in the low temperature\nstructure's crystal planes, however only for those with spacings affected by\nthis compression/expansion. GW calculations reveal that traversing this barrier\ndestabilises the bonding/anti-bonding splitting of the low temperature phase.\nThis precise atomic description of the origin of the energy barrier separating\nthe two structures will facilitate more precise control over the transition\ncharacteristics for new applications and devices.\n", "  We consider quantum quenches to the sinh-Gordon integrable quantum field\ntheory from a particular class of initial states. Our analysis includes the\ncase of mass and interaction quenches starting from a non-interacting theory.\nBy means of the recently developed quench action method, we fully characterize\nthe stationary state reached at long times after the quench in terms of the\ncorresponding rapidity distribution. We also provide exact results for the\nexpectation values of arbitrary vertex operators in the post-quench stationary\nstate by proposing a formula based on the analogy with the standard\nthermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Finally, we comment on the behavior of the\npost-quench stationary state under the mapping between the sinh-Gordon field\ntheory and the one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger model.\n", "  The X-ray luminosity functions of galaxies have become a useful tool for\npopulation studies of X-ray binaries in them. The availability of long term\nlight-curves of X-ray binaries with the All Sky X-ray Monitors opens up the\npossibility of constructing X-ray luminosity functions, by also including the\nintensity variation effects of the galactic X-ray binaries. We have constructed\nmultiple realizations of the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of Milky Way,\nusing the long term light-curves of sources obtained in the 2-10 keV energy\nband with the RXTE-ASM. The observed spread seen in the value of slope of both\nHMXB and LMXB XLFs are due to inclusion of variable luminosities of X-ray\nbinaries in construction of these XLFs as well as finite sample effects. XLFs\nconstructed for galactic HMXBs in the luminosity range 10^{36} - 10^{39}\nerg/sec is described by a power-law model with a mean power-law index of -0.48\nand a spread due to variability of HMXBs as 0.19. XLFs constructed for galactic\nLMXBs in the luminosity range 10^{36} - 10^{39} erg/sec has a shape of cut-off\npower-law with mean power-law index of -0.31 and a spread due to variability of\nLMXBs as 0.07.\n", "  Charged polar interfaces such as charged ferroelectric domain walls or\nheterostructured interfaces of ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O and LaAlO3/SrTiO3, across which the\nnormal component of electric polarization changes suddenly, can host large\ntwo-dimensional conduction. Charged ferroelectric walls, which are\nenergetically unfavorable in general, were found to be mysteriously abundant in\nhybrid improper ferroelectric (Ca,Sr)3Ti2O7 crystals. From the exploration of\nantiphase boundaries in bilayer-perovskites, we discover that each of four\npolarization-direction states is degenerated with two antiphase domains, and\nthese eight structural variants form a Z4xZ2 domain structure with Z3 vortices\nand five distinct types of domain walls, whose topology is directly relevant to\nthe presence of abundant charged walls. We also discover a zipper-like nature\nof antiphase boundaries; they are the reversible creation/annihilation centers\nof pairs of two types of ferroelectric walls (and also Z3-vortex pairs) in 90\nand 180 degree polarization switching. Our results demonstrate the unexpectedly\nrich nature of hybrid improper ferroelectricity.\n", "  The calibration of modern radio interferometers is a significant challenge,\nspecifically at low frequencies. In this perspective, we propose a novel\niterative calibration algorithm, which employs the popular sparse\nrepresentation framework, in the regime where the propagation conditions shift\ndissimilarly the directions of the sources. More precisely, our algorithm is\ndesigned to estimate the apparent directions of the calibration sources, their\npowers, the directional and undirectional complex gains of the array elements\nand their noise powers, with a reasonable computational complexity. Numerical\nsimulations reveal that the proposed scheme is statistically efficient at low\nSNR and even with additional non-calibration sources at unknown directions.\n", "  The ICM plasma is subject to firehose and mirror instabilities at scales of\norder the ion Larmor radius. The mirror instability generates fluctuations of\nmagnetic-field strength $\\delta B / B \\sim 1$. These fluctuations act as\nmagnetic traps for the heat-conducting electrons, suppressing their transport.\nWe calculate the effective parallel thermal conductivity in the ICM in the\npresence of the mirror fluctuations for different stages of the evolution of\nthe instability. The mirror fluctuations are limited in amplitude by the\nmaximum and minimum values of the field strength, with no large deviations from\nthe mean value. This key property leads to a finite suppression of thermal\nconduction at large scales. We find suppression down to $\\approx 0.2$ of the\nSpitzer value for the secular phase of the perturbations' growth, and $\\approx\n0.3$ for their saturated phase. The effect operates in addition to other\nsuppression mechanisms and independently of them. Globally, fluctuations\n$\\delta B / B \\sim 1$ can be present on much larger scales, of the order of the\nscale of turbulent motions. However, we do not expect large suppression of\nthermal conduction by these, because their scale is considerably larger than\nthe collisional mean free path of the ICM electrons. The obtained suppression\nof thermal conduction by a factor of $\\sim 5$ appears to be characteristic and\npotentially universal for a weakly collisional mirror-unstable plasma.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are new states of matter which feature novel Fermi arcs and\nexotic transport phenomena. Based on first-principles calculations, we report\nthat the chalcopyrites CuTlSe2, AgTlTe2, AuTlTe2 and ZnPbAs2 are ideal Weyl\nsemimetals, having largely separated Weyl points (~ 0.05/A) and uncovered Fermi\narcs that are amenable to experimental detections. We also construct a minimal\neffective model to capture the low-energy physics of this class of Weyl\nsemimetals. Our discovery is a major step toward a perfect playground of\nintriguing Weyl semimetals and potential applications for low-power and\nhigh-speed electronics.\n", "  Detailed tunneling spectroscopy of vortex core states can provide important\ninsight to the momentum structure of the superconducting order parameter. We\npresent a theoretical study of vortex bound states in iron-based\nsuperconductors by use of a realistic five-band model relevant to these\nsystems, and superconductivity stabilized by spin-fluctuation generated pairing\nvertices yielding an $s\\pm$ gap structure. The computed local density of states\nagrees remarkably well with both the bias dependence of the local conductance\nand the spatial structure of the low-bias conductance as obtained by scanning\ntunneling microscopy measurements on LiFeAs [T. Hanaguri et al., Phys. Rev. B\n85, 214505 (2012)].\n", "  We introduce a series of 20 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Lstar\n(M_200 =10^11.7 - 10^12.3 Msol) and group-sized (M_200 = 10^12.7 - 10^13.3\nMsol) haloes run with the model used for the EAGLE project, which additionally\nincludes a non-equilibrium ionization and cooling module that follows 136 ions.\nThe simulations reproduce the observed correlation, revealed by COS-Halos at\nz~0.2, between O VI column density at impact parameters b < 150 kpc and the\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR=SFR/Mstar) of the central galaxy at z~0.2.\nWe find that the column density of circumgalactic O VI is maximal in the haloes\nassociated with Lstar galaxies, because their virial temperatures are close to\nthe temperature at which the ionization fraction of O VI peaks (T~10^5.5 K).\nThe higher virial temperature of group haloes (> 10^6 K) promotes oxygen to\nhigher ionization states, suppressing the O VI column density. The observed NO\nVI-sSFR correlation therefore does not imply a causal link, but reflects the\nchanging characteristic ionization state of oxygen as halo mass is increased.\nIn spite of the mass-dependence of the oxygen ionization state, the most\nabundant circumgalactic oxygen ion in both Lstar and group haloes is O VII; O\nVI accounts for only 0.1% of the oxygen in group haloes and 0.9-1.3% with Lstar\nhaloes. Nonetheless, the metals traced by O VI absorbers represent a fossil\nrecord of the feedback history of galaxies over a Hubble time; their\ncharacteristic epoch of ejection corresponds to z > 1 and much of the ejected\nmetal mass resides beyond the virial radius of galaxies. For both Lstar and\ngroup galaxies, more of the oxygen produced and released by stars resides in\nthe circumgalactic medium (within twice the virial radius) than in the stars\nand ISM of the galaxy.\n", "  An ungravity-inspired model is employed to examine the astrophysical\nparameters of white dwarf stars (WDs) using polytropic and degenerate gas\napproaches. Based on the observed properties such as mass, radius, and\nluminosity of selected WDs, namely, Sirius B and $\\epsilon$ Reticulum, bounds\non the characteristic length and scaling dimension of the ungravity (UG) model\nare estimated. The UG effect on the Chandrasekhar limit for WDs is shown. The\nUG model is examined in the study of ultra-massive WDs, e.g., EUVE J1746-706.\nIn the contact of UG inspired model, a new location for some WDs on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram is found.\n", "  Temperature influences the performance of two-dimensional materials in\noptoelectronic devices. Indeed, the optical characterization of these materials\nis usually realized at room temperature. Nevertheless most {\\it ab-initio}\nstudies are yet performed without including any temperature effect. As a\nconsequence, important features are thus overlooked, such as the relative\nintensity of the excitonic peaks and their broadening, directly related to the\ntemperature and to the non-radiative exciton relaxation time. We present {\\it\nab-initio} calculations of the optical response of single-layer MoS$_2$, a\nprototype 2D material, as a function of temperature using density functional\ntheory and many-body perturbation theory. We compute the electron-phonon\ninteraction using the full spinorial wave functions, i.e., fully taking into\naccount effects of spin-orbit interaction. We find that bound excitons ($A$ and\n$B$ peaks) and resonant excitons ($C$ peak) exhibit different behavior with\ntemperature, displaying different non-radiative linewidths. We conclude that\nthe inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption spectra is mainly due to\nelectron-phonon scattering mechanisms. Our calculations explain the\nshortcomings of previous (zero-temperature) theoretical spectra and match well\nwith the experimental spectra acquired at room temperature. Moreover, we\ndisentangle the contributions of acoustic and optical phonon modes to the\nquasi-particles and exciton linewidths. Our model also allows to identify which\nphonon modes couple to each exciton state, useful for the interpretation of\nresonant Raman scattering experiments.\n", "  Investigating the dynamics of gravitational systems, especially in the regime\nof quantum gravity, poses a problem of measuring time during the evolution. One\nof the approaches to this issue is using one of the internal degrees of freedom\nas a time variable. The objective of our research was to check whether a scalar\nfield or any other dynamical quantity being a part of a coupled multi-component\nmatter-geometry system can be treated as a `clock' during its evolution. We\ninvestigated a collapse of a self-gravitating electrically charged scalar field\nin the Einstein and Brans-Dicke theories using the 2+2 formalism. Our findings\nconcentrated on the spacetime region of high curvature existing in the vicinity\nof the emerging singularity, which is essential for the quantum gravity\napplications. We investigated several values of the Brans-Dicke coupling\nconstant and the coupling between the Brans-Dicke and the electrically charged\nscalar fields. It turned out that both evolving scalar fields and a function\nwhich measures the amount of electric charge within a sphere of a given radius\ncan be used to quantify time nearby the singularity in the dynamical spacetime\npart, in which the apparent horizon surrounding the singularity is spacelike.\nUsing them in this respect in the asymptotic spacetime region is possible only\nwhen both fields are present in the system and, moreover, they are coupled to\neach other. The only nonzero component of the Maxwell field four-potential\ncannot be used to quantify time during the considered process in the\nneighborhood of the whole central singularity. None of the investigated\ndynamical quantities is a good candidate for measuring time nearby the Cauchy\nhorizon, which is also singular due to the mass inflation phenomenon.\n", "  We revisit the pressure-induced metal-insulator-transition of solid hydrogen\nby means of variational quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the\nantisymmetric shadow wave function. In order to facilitate studying the\nelectronic structure of large-scale fermionic systems, the shadow wave function\nformalism is extended by a series of technical improvements, such as a revised\noptimization method for the employed shadow wave function and an enhanced\ntreatment of periodic systems with long-range interactions. It is found that\nthe superior accuracy of the antisymmetric shadow wave function results in a\nsignificantly increased transition pressure.\n", "  We study the scenario of fermionic dark matter that annihilates to standard\nmodel fermions through an s-channel axial vector mediator. We point out that\nthe well-known chirality suppression of the annihilation cross section can be\nalleviated by s-channel internal Higgsstrahlung. The shapes of the cosmic ray\nspectra are identical to that of t-channel internal Higgsstrahlung in the limit\nof a heavy mediating particle. Unlike the general case of t-channel\nbremsstrahlung, s-channel Higgsstrahlung can be the dominant annihilation\nprocess even for Dirac dark matter. Since the s-channel mediator can be a\nstandard model singlet, collider searches for the mediator are easily\ncircumvented.\n", "  We theoretically investigate four types of dynamical instability, in\nparticular the periodic and oscillatory type $I_O$, in an anti-ferromagnetic\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in a nonzero magnetic field, by employing the\ncoupled-mode theory and numerical method. This is in sharp contrast to the\ndynamical stability of the same system in zero field. Remarkably, a pattern\ntransition from a periodic dynamical instability $I_O$ to a uniform one $III_O$\noccurs at a critical magnetic field. All the four types of dynamical\ninstability and the pattern transition are ready to be detected in $^{23}$Na\ncondensates within the availability of the current experimental techniques.\n", "  We study the holographic phase transition of superconductor dual to a\nLifshitz black brane probed by an anisotropic scalar field in the probe limit\nin Ho\\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. With the use of numerical and analytical\nmethod, we investigate how the critical temperature of the condensation is\naffected by the Lifshitz exponent $z$, $\\alpha-$correction term in the action\nas well as the dimensions of the gravity. We also numerically explore the\ncondensation of the dual operator and optical conductivity of the holographic\nsystem. Various interesting properties of the holographic condensation affected\nby the parameters of model are discussed.\n", "  Lattice models with non-hermitian, parity and time-reversal ($\\mathcal{PT}$)\nsymmetric Hamiltonians, realized most readily in coupled optical systems, have\nbeen intensely studied in the past few years. A $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric dimer\nlattice consists of dimers with intra-dimer coupling $\\nu$, inter-dimer\ncoupling $\\nu'$, and balanced gain and loss potentials $\\pm i\\gamma$ within\neach dimer. This model undergoes two independent transitions, namely a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-breaking transition and a topological transition. We numerically\nand analytically investigate the signatures of these transitions in the\ntime-evolution of states that are initially localized on the gain-site or the\nloss-site.\n", "  We show that the introduction of a minimal length in the context of\nnon-commutative spacetime gives rise (after some considerations) to\nhigher-order theories. We then explicitly demonstrate how these\nhigher-derivative theories appear as a generalization of the standard\nelectromagnetism and general relativity by applying a consistent procedure that\nmodifies the original Maxwell and Einstein-Hilbert actions. In order to set a\nbound on the minimal length, we compare the deviations from the inverse-square\nlaw with the potentials obtained in the higher-order theories and discuss the\nvalidity of the results. The introduction of a quantum bound for the minimal\nlength parameter $\\sqrt{\\beta}$ in the higher-order QED allows us to lower the\nactual limits on the parameters of higher-derivative gravity by almost half of\ntheir order of magnitude.\n", "  The Cox-Voinov law on dynamic spreading relates the difference between the\ncubic values of the apparent contact angle (theta) and the equilibrium contact\nangle to the instantaneous contact line speed (U). Comparing spreading results\nwith this law requires accurate data of theta and U during the entire process.\nWe consider the case when gravitational forces are negligible and transform the\ngeneral Cox law in a relationship for the temporal evolution of the spreading\nradius. For cap-shaped droplets, this enables a comparison of experimental or\ncomputational results with Cox theory without the need for instantaneous data\nof theta and U. The fitting of Cox theory against measured or computed\nbase-radius-over-time curves allows estimating the effective slip length. This\nis useful for establishing relationships between slip length and parameters in\nnumerical methods for moving contact lines. The procedure is illustrated by\nnumerical simulations for partially wetting droplets employing the coupled\nlevel-set volume-of-fluid and phase field methods.\n", "  Both Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are minor bodies found in\nthe outer Solar System. Centaurs are a transient population that moves between\nthe orbits of Jupiter and Neptune, and they probably diffused out of the TNOs.\nTNOs move mainly beyond Neptune. Some of these objects display episodic\ncometary behaviour; a few percent of them are known to host binary companions.\nHere, we study the light-curves of two Centaurs -2060 Chiron (1977 UB) and\n10199 Chariklo (1997 CU26)- and three TNOs -38628 Huya (2000 EB173), 28978\nIxion (2001 KX76), and 90482 Orcus (2004 DW)- and the colours of the Centaurs\nand Huya. Precise, ~1%, R-band absolute CCD photometry of these minor bodies\nacquired between 2006 and 2011 is presented; the new data are used to\ninvestigate the rotation rate of these objects. The colours of the Centaurs and\nHuya are determined using BVRI photometry. The point spread function of the\nfive minor bodies is analysed, searching for signs of a coma or close\ncompanions. Astrometry is also discussed. A periodogram analysis of the\nlight-curves of these objects gives the following rotational periods: 5.5+-0.4\nh for Chiron, 7.0+-0.6 h for Chariklo, 4.45+-0.07 h for Huya, 12.4+-0.3 h for\nIxion, and 11.9+-0.5 h for Orcus. The colour indices of Chiron are found to be\nB-V=0.53+-0.05, V-R=0.37+-0.08, and R-I=0.36+-0.15. The values computed for\nChariklo are V-R=0.62+-0.07 and R-I=0.61+-0.07. For Huya, we find\nV-R=0.58+-0.09 and R-I=0.64+-0.20. We find very low levels of cometary activity\n(if any) and no sign of close or wide binary companions for these minor bodies.\n", "  It has recently been shown that the Hawking evaporation process of\n$(3+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes is characterized by the\ndimensionless ratio $\\eta\\equiv\\tau_{\\text{gap}}/\\tau_{\\text{emission}}\\gg1$,\nwhere $\\tau_{\\text{gap}}$ is the characteristic time gap between the emissions\nof successive Hawking quanta and $\\tau_{\\text{emission}}$ is the characteristic\ntimescale required for an individual Hawking quantum to be emitted from the\nSchwarzschild black hole. This strong inequality implies that the Hawking\ncascade of gravitons from a $(3+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole is\nextremely {\\it sparse}. In the present paper we explore the semi-classical\nHawking evaporation rates of {\\it higher}-dimensional Schwarzschild black\nholes. We find that the dimensionless ratio\n$\\eta(D)\\equiv{{\\tau_{\\text{gap}}}/{\\tau_{\\text{emission}}}}$, which\ncharacterizes the Hawking emission of gravitons from the $(D+1)$-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black holes, is a {\\it decreasing} function of the spacetime\ndimension. In particular, we show that higher-dimensional Schwarzschild black\nholes with $D\\gtrsim 10$ are characterized by the relation $\\eta(D)<1$. Our\nresults thus imply that, contrary to the $(3+1)$-dimensional case, the\ncharacteristic Hawking cascades of gravitons from these higher-dimensional\nblack holes have a {\\it continuous} character.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) has been realized in atomic\nsystems, but fulfilling the EIT conditions for artificial atoms made from\nsuperconducting circuits is a more difficult task. Here we report an\nexperimental observation of the EIT in a tunable three-dimensional transmon by\nprobing the cavity transmission. To fulfill the EIT conditions, we tune the\ntransmon to adjust its damping rates by utilizing the effect of the cavity on\nthe transmon states. From the experimental observations, we clearly identify\nthe EIT and Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) regimes as well as the transition\nregime in between. Also, the experimental data demonstrate that the threshold\n$\\Omega_{\\rm AIC}$ determined by the Akaike information criterion can describe\nthe EIT-ATS transition better than the threshold $\\Omega_{\\rm EIT}$ given by\nthe EIT theory.\n", "  The competition between intra molecular charge redistribution and\nfragmentation has been studied in small molecules containing iodine by using\nintense ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet regime (XUV). We show that\nafter an element specific inner-shell photoionization of diiodomethane\n(CH$_2$I$_2$) and iodomethane (CH$_3$I), the induced positive charge is\nredistributed with a significantly different efficiency. Therefore, we analyze\nion time-of-flight data obtained from XUV-pump XUV-probe experiments at the\nFree Electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH). Theoretical considerations on the basis\nof ab initio electronic structure calculations including correlations relate\nthis effect to a strongly molecule specific, purely electronic charge\nredistribution process that takes place directly after photoionization causing\na distribution of the induced positive charge predominantly on the atoms which\nexhibit the lowest atomic ionization potential, i.e, in the molecules\nconsidered, the iodine atom(s). As a result of the very different initial\ncharge distributions, the fragmentation timescales of the two molecules\nexperimentally observed are strikingly different.\n", "  We have developed an observing program using deep, multiband imaging to probe\nthe chaotic regions of tidal tails in search of an underlying stellar\npopulation, using NGC 3256's 400 Myr twin tidal tails as a case study. These\ntails have different colours of $u - g = 1.05 \\pm 0.07$ and $r - i = 0.13 \\pm\n0.07$ for NGC 3256W, and $u - g = 1.26 \\pm 0.07$ and $r - i = 0.26 \\pm 0.07$\nfor NGC 3256E, indicating different stellar populations. These colours\ncorrespond to simple stellar population ages of $288^{+11}_{-54}$ Myr and\n$841^{+125}_{-157}$ Myr for NGC 3256W and NGC 3256E, respectively, suggesting\nNGC 3256W's diffuse light is dominated by stars formed after the interaction,\nwhile light in NGC 3256E is primarily from stars that originated in the host\ngalaxy. Using a mixed stellar population model, we break our diffuse light into\ntwo populations: one at 10 Gyr, representing stars pulled from the host\ngalaxies, and a younger component, whose age is determined by fitting the model\nto the data. We find similar ages for the young populations of both tails,\n($195^{-13}_{+0}$ and $170^{-70}_{+44}$ Myr for NGC 3256W and NGC 3256E,\nrespectively), but a larger percentage of mass in the 10 Gyr population for NGC\n3256E ($98^{+1}_{-3}\\%$ vs $90^{+5}_{-6}\\%$). Additionally, we detect 31 star\ncluster candidates in NGC 3256W and 19 in NGC 2356E, with median ages of 141\nMyr and 91 Myr, respectively. NGC 3256E contains several young (< 10 Myr), low\nmass objects with strong nebular emission, indicating a small, recent burst of\nstar formation.\n", "  In this paper, we compare the RMF theory and the model of deformed oscillator\nshells (DOS) in description of the quantum properties of the bound states of\nthe spherically symmetric light nuclei. We obtain an explicit analytical\nrelation between differential equations for the RMF theory and DOS model, which\ndetermine wave functions for nucleons. On such a basis we perform analysis of\ncorrespondence of quantum properties of nuclei. We find: (1) Potential\n$V_{RMF}$ of the RMF theory for nucleons has the wave functions $f$ and $g$\nwith joint part $h$ coincident exactly with the nucleon wave function of DOS\nmodel with potential $V_{\\rm shell}$. But, a difference between $V_{RMF}$ and\n$V_{\\rm shell}$ is essential for any nucleus. (2) The nucleon wave functions\nand densities obtained by the DOS and RMF theories are essentially different.\nThe nucleon densities of the RMF theory contradict to knowledge about\ndistribution of the proton and neutron densities inside the nuclei obtained\nfrom experimental data. This indicates that $g$ and $f$ have no sense of the\nwave functions of quantum physics. But, $h$ provides proper description of\nquantum properties of nucleons inside the nucleus. (3) We calculate meson\nfunction $w^{0}$ and potential $V_{w}$ in RMF theory based on the found nucleon\ndensity. (4) $f$ and $g$ are not solutions of Dirac equation with $V_{w}$. If\nthe meson theory describes quantum properties of nucleus well, then a\ndifference between $V_{w}$ and $V_{RMF}$ should be as small as possible. We\nintroduce new quantum corrections characterizing difference between these\npotentials. We find that (a) The function $w^{0}$ should be reinforced\nstrongly, (b) The corrections are necessary to describe the quantum properties\nof the nuclei.\n", "  We prove that every $C^2$ Anosov diffeomorphism in a compact and connected\nRiemannian manifold has a unique SRB and physical probability measure, whose\nbasin of attraction covers Lebesgue almost every point in the manifold. Then,\nwe use structural stability of Anosov diffeomorphisms to deduce that all $C^1$\nAnosov diffeomorphisms on compact and connected Riemannian manifolds are\ntransitive.\n", "  In solids, the high density of charged particles makes many-body interactions\na pervasive principle governing optics and electronics[1-12]. However, Walter\nKohn found in 1961 that the cyclotron resonance of Landau-quantized electrons\nis independent of the seemingly inescapable Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons[2]. While this surprising theorem has been exploited in sophisticated\nquantum phenomena[13-15] such as ultrastrong light-matter coupling[16],\nsuperradiance[17], and coherent control[18], the complete absence of\nnonlinearities excludes many intriguing possibilities, such as quantum-logic\nprotocols[19]. Here, we use intense terahertz pulses to drive the cyclotron\nresponse of a two-dimensional electron gas beyond the protective limits of\nKohn's theorem. Anharmonic Landau ladder climbing and distinct terahertz four-\nand six-wave mixing signatures occur, which our theory links to dynamic Coulomb\neffects between electrons and the positively charged ion background. This new\ncontext for Kohn's theorem unveils previously inaccessible internal degrees of\nfreedom of Landau electrons, opening up new realms of ultrafast quantum control\nfor electrons.\n", "  In this paper, we extend an alternative, phenomenological approach to\ninflation by means of an equation of state and a sound speed, both of them\nfunctions of the number of $e$-folds and three phenomenological parameters.\nThis approach captures a number of possible inflationary models, including\nthose with non-canonical kinetic terms or scale-dependent non-gaussianities. We\nperform Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses using the latest cosmological\npublicly available measurements, which include Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) data from the Planck satellite. In the context of the phenomenological\ndescription studied here, the sound speed of the primordial curvature\nperturbation is found to be $c_s> 0.2$ at $95\\%$~CL for a number of $e$-folds\n$N=60$. Within this parametrization, we discard scale invariance with a\nsignificance of about $10\\sigma$, and the running of the spectral index is\nconstrained as $\\alpha_s=-0.62\\,^{+0.08}_{-0.09} \\times 10^{-3}$. The limit on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r<0.003$ at $95\\%$~CL from CMB data alone. The\nmaximum amplitude of the equilateral non-gaussianity that we obtain,\n$|f^{\\text{equil}}_{\\text{NL}}|\\sim 2$, is much smaller than the current Planck\nmission errors. Future high-redshift, all-sky surveys could reach the required\naccuracy on equilateral non-gaussianities to allow for additional and\nindependent tests of the parametrization explored here.\n", "  We investigate a class of growing two-dimensional Young diagrams parametrized\nby a non-negative integer r, the minimal difference between the heights of\nadjacent columns. The limit shapes emerging in the long time limit are\nanalytically determined, and fluctuations of the height and the width are\nbriefly discussed. We also analyze the generalization to `diffusively' growing\nYoung diagrams.\n", "  In this second paper of a series, we explore the B-V, U-B, and FUV-NUV radial\ncolor trends from a multi-wavelength sample of 141 dwarf disk galaxies. Like\nspirals, dwarf galaxies have three types of radial surface brightness profiles:\n(I) single exponential throughout the observed extent (the minority), (II)\ndown-bending (the majority), and (III) up-bending. We find that colors of (1)\nType I dwarfs generally become redder with increasing radius unlike spirals\nthat have a blueing trend that flattens beyond ~1.5 disk scale lengths, (2)\nType II dwarfs come in six different \"flavors,\" one of which mimics the \"U\"\nshape of spirals, and (3) Type III dwarfs have a stretched \"S\" shape where\ncentral colors are flattish, become steeply redder to the surface brightness\nbreak, then remain roughly constant beyond, similar to spiral TypeIII color\nprofiles, but without the central outward bluing. Faint (-9 > M_B > -14) Type\nII dwarfs tend to have continuously red or \"U\" shaped colors and steeper color\nslopes than bright (-14 > M_B > -19) Type II dwarfs, which additionally have\ncolors that become bluer or remain constant with increasing radius. Sm dwarfs\nand BCDs tend to have at least some blue and red radial color trend,\nrespectively. Additionally, we determine stellar surface mass density (Sigma)\nprofiles and use them to show that the break in Sigma generally remains in Type\nII dwarfs (unlike Type II spirals) but generally disappears in Type III dwarfs\n(unlike Type III spirals). Moreover, the break in Sigma is strong,\nintermediate, and weak in faint dwarfs, bright dwarfs, and spirals,\nrespectively, indicating that Sigma may straighten with increasing galaxy mass.\nLastly, the average stellar surface mass density at the surface brightness\nbreak is roughly 1-2 M_S/pc^2 for Type II dwarfs but higher at 5.9 M_S/pc^2 or\n27 M_S/pc^2 for Type III BCDs and dIms, respectively.\n", "  The bifurcation method is a way to do rare event sampling -- to estimate the\nprobability of events that are too rare to be found by direct simulation. We\ndescribe the bifurcation method and use it to estimate the transition rate of a\ndouble well potential problem. We show that the associated constrained path\nsampling problem can be addressed by a combination of Crooks-Chandler sampling\nand parallel tempering and marginalization.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis aimed at understanding electrical\nconduction in molecular tunnel junctions. We focus on discussing the validity\nof coherent versus incoherent theoretical formulations for single-level\ntunneling to explain experimental results obtained under a wide range of\nexperimental conditions, including measurements in individual molecules\nconnecting the leads of electromigrated single-electron transistors and\njunctions of self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of molecules sandwiched between\ntwo macroscopic contacts. We show that the restriction of transport through a\nsingle level in solid state junctions (no solvent) makes coherent and\nincoherent tunneling formalisms indistinguishable when only one level\nparticipates in transport. Similar to Marcus relaxation processes in wet\nelectrochemistry, the thermal broadening of the Fermi distribution describing\nthe electronic occupation energies in the electrodes accounts for the\nexponential dependence of the tunneling current on temperature. We demonstrate\nthat a single-level tunnel model satisfactorily explains experimental results\nobtained in three different molecular junctions (both single-molecule and\nSAM-based) formed by ferrocene-based molecules. Among other things, we use the\nmodel to map the electrostatic potential profile in EGaIn-based SAM junctions\nin which the ferrocene unit is placed at different positions within the\nmolecule, and we find that electrical screening gives rise to a strongly\nnon-linear profile across the junction.\n", "  In this paper, a six-cylinder-port hohlraum is proposed to provide high\nsymmetry flux on capsule. It is designed to ignite a capsule with 1.2 mm radius\nin indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion (ICF) . Flux symmetry and laser\nenergy are calculated by using three dimensional view factor method and laser\nenergy balance in hohlraums. Plasma conditions are analyzed based on the two\ndimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. There is no Ylm (l<=4)\nasymmetry in the six-cylinder-port hohlraum when the influences of laser\nentrance holes (LEHs) and laser spots cancel each other out with suitable\ntarget parameters. A radiation drive with 300 eV and good flux symmetry can be\nachieved with use of laser energy of 2.3 MJ and 500 TW peak power. According to\nthe simulations, the electron temperature and the electron density on the wall\nof laser cone are high and low, respectively, which are similar to those of\nouter cones in the hohlraums on National Ignition Facility (NIF). And the laser\nintensity is also as low as those of NIF outer cones. So the backscattering due\nto laser plasma interaction (LPI) is considered to be negligible. The\nsix-cyliner-port hohlraum could be superior to the traditional cylindrical\nhohlraum and the octahedral hohlraum in both higher symmetry and lower\nbackscattering without supplementary technology at acceptable laser energy. It\nis undoubted that the hohlraum will add to the diversity of ICF approaches.\n", "  We present a unified view of the frequency dependence of the various\nscattering processes involved when a neutral hydrogen atom interacts with a\nmonochromatic, linearly-polarized photon. A computational approach is employed\nof the atom trapped by a finite-sized-box due to a finite basis-set expansion,\nwhich generates a set of transition matrix elements between $E<0$ eigenstates\nand $E>0$ pseudostates. We introduce a general computational methodology that\nenables the computation of the frequency-dependent dipole transition\npolarizability with one real and two different imaginary contributions. These\ndipole transition polarizabilities are related to the cross-sections of\none-photon photoionization, Rayleigh, Raman, and Compton scattering. Our\nnumerical calculations reveal individual Raman scattering cross-sections above\nthreshold that can rapidly vanish and revive. Furthermore, our numerical\nCompton cross-sections do not overtly suffer from the infra-red divergence\nproblem, and are three orders-of-magnitude higher than previous analytic-based\nCompton scattering cross-sections. Our total photon-hydrogen scattering\ncross-sections thus resolve the discrepancies between these previous\ncalculations and those in the N.I.S.T. `FFAST' database.\n", "  This report summarises the physics opportunities in the search and study of\nphysics beyond the Standard Model at a 100 TeV pp collider.\n", "  How can we find a good graph clustering of a real-world network, that allows\ninsight into its underlying structure and also potential functions? In this\npaper, we introduce a new graph clustering algorithm Dcut from a density point\nof view. The basic idea is to envision the graph clustering as a density-cut\nproblem, such that the vertices in the same cluster are densely connected and\nthe vertices between clusters are sparsely connected. To identify meaningful\nclusters (communities) in a graph, a density-connected tree is first\nconstructed in a local fashion. Owing to the density-connected tree, Dcut\nallows partitioning a graph into multiple densely tight-knit clusters directly.\nWe demonstrate that our method has several attractive benefits: (a) Dcut\nprovides an intuitive criterion to evaluate the goodness of a graph clustering\nin a more natural and precise way; (b) Built upon the density-connected tree,\nDcut allows identifying the meaningful graph clusters of densely connected\nvertices efficiently; (c) The density-connected tree provides a connectivity\nmap of vertices in a graph from a local density perspective. We systematically\nevaluate our new clustering approach on synthetic as well as real data to\ndemonstrate its good performance.\n", "  The first detection of gravitational waves by LIGO from the merger of two\ncompact objects has sparked new interest in detecting electromagnetic\ncounterparts to these violent events. For mergers involving neutron stars, it\nis thought that prompt high-energy emission in gamma rays and x-rays will be\nfollowed days to weeks later by an afterglow in visible light, infrared and\nradio. Rapid sky localization using the data from a network of gravitational\nwave detectors is essential to maximize the chances of making a joint\ndetection. Here I describe a new technique that is able to produce accurate,\nfully Bayesian sky maps in seconds or less. The technique can be applied to\nspin-precessing compact binaries, and can take into account detector\ncalibration and spectral estimation uncertainties.\n", "  The nonlinear propagation of optical pulses in dielectric waveguides and\nresonators provides a laboratory to investigate a wide range of remarkable\ninteractions. Many of the resulting phenomena find applications in optical\nsystems. One example is dispersive wave generation, the optical analog of\nCherenkov radiation. These waves have an essential role in fiber spectral\nbroadeners that are routinely used in spectrocopy and metrology. Dispersive\nwaves form when a soliton pulse begins to radiate power as a result of\nhigher-order dispersion. Recently, dispersive wave generation in microcavities\nhas been reported by phase matching the waves to dissipative Kerr cavity (DKC)\nsolitons. Here, it is shown that spatial mode interactions within a microcavity\ncan also be used to induce dispersive waves. These interactions are normally\navoided altogether in DKC soliton generation. The soliton self frequency shift\nis also shown to induce fine tuning control of the dispersive wave frequency.\nBoth this mechanism and spatial mode interactions provide a new method to\nspectrally control these important waves.\n", "  We establish the fundamental limit of communication capacity within Gaussian\nschemes under phase-insensitive Gaussian channels, which employ multimode\nGaussian states for encoding and collective Gaussian operations and\nmeasurements for decoding. We prove that this Gaussian capacity is additive,\ni.e., its upper bound occurs with separable encoding and separable receivers so\nthat a single-mode communication suffices to achieve the largest capacity under\nGaussian schemes. This rigorously characterizes the gap between the ultimate\nHolevo capacity and the capacity within Gaussian communication, showing that\nGaussian regime is not sufficient to achieve the Holevo bound particularly in\nthe low-photon regime. Furthermore the Gaussian benchmark established here can\nbe used to critically assess the performance of non-Gaussian protocols for\noptical communication. We move on to identify non-Gaussian schemes to beat the\nGaussian capacity and show that a non-Gaussian receiver recently implemented by\nBecerra et al. [Nat. Photon. 7, 147 (2013)] can achieve this aim with an\nappropriately chosen encoding strategy.\n", "  Differentially rotating disks under the effect of axial magnetic field are\nprone to a nonlinear explosive magnetorotational instability (EMRI).\n  The dynamic equations that govern the temporal evolution of the amplitudes of\nthree weakly-detuned resonantly interacting modes are derived. As distinct from\nexponential growth in the strict resonance triads EMRI occurs due to the\nresonant interactions of a MRI mode with stable Alfv\\'en-Coriolis and\nmagnetosonic modes. Numerical solutions of the dynamic equations for amplitudes\nof a triad indicate that two types of perturbations behavior can be excited for\nresonance conditions: (i) EMRI which leads to infinite values of the three\namplitudes within a finite time, and (ii) bounded irregular oscillations of all\nthree amplitudes.\n  Asymptotic explicit solutions of the dynamic equations are obtained for EMRI\nregimes and are shown to match the numerical solutions near the explosion time.\n", "  The properties of newly discovered polar ScFeO3 with magnetic ordering are\nexamined using Ab initio calculations and symmetry mode analysis. The GGA+U\ncalculation confirms the stability of polar R3c Phase in ScFeO3 and the\npressure induced phase transition to non-polar Pnma phase. Octahedron tilting\nand structural properties as a function of applied pressure have been analyzed.\nThe origin of polar phase is associated with instability of non-polar R-3c\nphase and group theory using the symmetry mode analysis has been applied to\nunderstand this instability as well as the spontaneous polarization of polar\nR3c phase. The magnetic phase transition shows G-type AFM ordering of Fe3+ ion\nwithin Goodenough-Kanamori theory and the possibility of magnetic spin\nstructure has been analyzed by using energy analysis including spin canting\npossibility.\n", "  The HL-LHC phase is designed to increase by an order of magnitude the amount\nof data to be collected by the LHC experiments. To achieve this goal in a\nreasonable time scale the instantaneous luminosity would also increase by an\norder of magnitude up to $6 \\cdot 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The region of the\nforward muon spectrometer ($|\\eta| > 1.6$) is not equipped with RPC stations.\nThe increase of the expected particles rate up to 2 kHz/cm$^2$ ( including a\nsafety factor 3 ) motivates the installation of RPC chambers to guarantee\nredundancy with the CSC chambers already present. The actual RPC technology of\nCMS cannot sustain the expected background level. A new generation Glass-RPC\n(GRPC) using low resistivity glass (LR) is proposed to equip at least the two\nmost far away of the four high eta muon stations of CMS. The design of small\nsize prototypes and the studies of their performances under high rate particles\nflux is presented.\n", "  This article reviews recent experimental investigations on two binary\nFe-chalcogenides: FeSe and Fe$_{1+y}$Te. The main focus is on synthesis, single\ncrystal growth, chemical composition, as well as on the effect of excess iron\non structural, magnetic, and transport properties of these materials. The\nstructurally simplest Fe-based superconductor Fe$_{1+x}$Se with a critical\ntemperature $T_c \\approx$ 8.5 K undergoes a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase\ntransition at a temperature $T_s \\approx$ 87 K. No long-range magnetic order is\nobserved down to the lowest measured temperature in Fe$_{1+x}$Se. On the other\nhand, isostructural Fe$_{1+y}$Te displays a complex interplay of magnetic and\nstructural phase transitions in dependence on the tuning parameter such as\nexcess amount of Fe or pressure, but it becomes a superconductor only when Te\nis substituted by a sufficient amount of Se. We summarize experimental evidence\nfor different competing interactions and discuss related open questions.\n", "  Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been observed not only in the hot cores\nsurrounding low- and high- mass protostars, but also in cold dark clouds.\nTherefore, it is interesting to understand how such species can be formed\nwithout the presence of embedded energy sources. We present new laboratory\nexperiments on the low-temperature solid state formation of three complex\nmolecules: methyl formate (HC(O)OCH3), glycolaldehyde (HC(O)CH2OH) and ethylene\nglycol (H2C(OH)CH2OH), through recombination of free radicals formed via H-atom\naddition and abstraction reactions at different stages in the CO-H2CO-CH3OH\nhydrogenation network at 15 K. The experiments extend previous CO hydrogenation\nstudies and aim at resembling the physical&chemical conditions typical of the\nCO freeze-out stage in dark molecular clouds, when H2CO and CH3OH form by\nrecombination of accreting CO molecules and H-atoms on ice grains. We confirm\nthat H2CO, once formed through CO hydrogenation, not only yields CH3OH through\nongoing H-atom addition reactions, but is also subject to H-atom-induced\nabstraction reactions, yielding CO again. In a similar way, H2CO is also formed\nin abstraction reactions involving CH3OH. The dominant methanol H-atom\nabstraction product is expected to be CH2OH, while H-atom additions to H2CO\nshould at least partially proceed through CH3O intermediate radicals. The\noccurrence of H-atom abstraction reactions in ice mantles leads to more\nreactive intermediates (HCO, CH3O and CH2OH) than previously thought, when\nassuming sequential H-atom addition reactions only. This enhances the\nprobability to form COMs through radical-radical recombination without the need\nof UV photolysis or cosmic rays as external triggers.\n", "  The energies of the alkali exchange reactions are computed from density\nfunctional calculations for a series of alkali silicate minerals.\nFirst-principles calculations are compared against (1) experiment; (2)\nthermodynamic models; (3) calculations using empirical interatomic potentials\n(with both polarizable shell model potentials and pairwise potentials with\npartial charges); and (4) empirical correlations based on optical basicity and\nPauling bond strength. The first-principles calculations correlate well with\nexperimental values. The shell model potentials appear to account for Si-O-Si\nversus Si-O oxygen basicity, but don't recover the differences in basicity\nbetween Al-O-Si and Si-O-Si donors. The pair potentials don't even\nqualitatively reproduce the reactivity trends established in the\nfirst-principles calculations. Empirical correlations based on optical basicity\nand Pauling bond strength successfully rank-order the exchange energies, but\nfail to describe the large difference in basicity between Si-O-Si and Si-O\noxygen atoms. Knowing which models are capable of predicting ion exchange\nenergies in silicate minerals improves understanding of the physics of bonding\nin ion-exchanged glasses.\n", "  Carbon nitride-based nanostructures have attracted special attention (from\ntheory and experiments) due to their remarkable electromechanical properties.\nIn this work we have investigated the mechanical properties of some\ngraphene-like carbon nitride membranes through fully atomistic reactive\nmolecular dynamics simulations. We have analyzed three different structures of\nthese CN families, the so-called graphene-based g-CN, triazine-based g-C3N4 and\nheptazine-based g-C3N4. The stretching dynamics of these membranes was studied\nfor deformations along their two main axes and at three different temperatures:\n10K, 300K and 600K. We show that g-CN membranes have the lowest ultimate\nfracture strain value, followed by heptazine-based and triazine-based ones,\nrespectively. This behavior can be explained in terms of their differences in\nterms of density values, topologies and types of chemical bonds. The dependency\nof the fracture patterns on the stretching directions is also discussed.\n", "  This note describes the analytical derivation of the response of bullseye\ndetectors to optical beats between higher-order spatial modes of the\nLaguerre-Gauss form, and subsequently the Hermite-Gauss form. Also included is\na comparison with numerically calculated beat coefficients, and a simple\nexample of the use of the resulting beat coefficients in simulating a mode\nmismatch sensor for a Fabry-Perot cavity.\n", "  We present an atlas of more than one hundred original images of planetary\nnebulae (PNe). These images were taken in a narrow-band filter centred on the\nnebular emission of the [N II] during several observing campaigns using two\nmoderate-aperture telescopes, at the Complejo Astron\\'omico El Leoncito\n(CASLEO), and the Estaci\\'on Astrof\\'isica de Bosque Alegre (EABA), both in\nArgentina. The data provided by this atlas represent one of the most extensive\nimage surveys of PNe in [N II]. We compare the new images with those available\nin the literature, and briefly describe all cases in which our [N II] images\nreveal new and interesting structures.\n", "  We analyze the model of gamma-ray binaries, consisting of a massive star and\na pulsar with ultrarelativistic wind. We consider radiation from energetic\nparticles, accelerated at the pulsar wind termination shock, and feedback of\nthis radiation on the wind through production of secondary electron-positron\npairs. We show that the pair feedback limits the Lorentz factor of the pulsar\nwind and creates a population of very energetic pairs, whose radiation may be\nresponsible for the observed gamma-ray signal.\n", "  We used the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global magnetohydrodynamics model to study\nthe effects of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) IMF $\\mathit{B}_{y}$\ncomponent on the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere-ionosphere\nsystem. When the IMF reconnects with the terrestrial magnetic field with IMF\n$\\mathit{B}_{y}$ $\\neq$ 0, flux transport is asymmetrically distributed between\nthe two hemispheres. We describe how $\\mathit{B}_{y}$ is induced in the closed\nmagnetosphere on both the dayside and nightside and present the governing\nequations. The magnetosphere imposes asymmetric forces on the ionosphere, and\nthe effects on the ionospheric flow are characterized by distorted convection\ncell patterns, often referred to as \"banana\" and \"orange\" cell patterns. The\nflux asymmetrically added to the lobes results in a non-uniform induced\n$\\mathit{B}_{y}$ in the closed magnetosphere. By including the dynamics of the\nsystem, we introduce a mechanism that predicts asymmetric Birkeland currents at\nconjugate foot points. Asymmetric Birkeland currents are created as a\nconsequence of $\\textit {y}$ directed tension contained in the return flow.\nAssociated with these currents, we expect fast localized ionospheric azimuthal\nflows present in one hemisphere but not necessarily in the other. We also\npresent current density measurements from Active Magnetosphere and Planetary\nElectrodynamics Response Experiment that are consistent with this picture. We\nargue that the induced $\\mathit{B}_{y}$ produces asymmetrical Birkeland\ncurrents as a consequence of asymmetric stress balance between the hemispheres.\nSuch an asymmetry will also lead to asymmetrical foot points and asymmetries in\nthe azimuthal flow in the ionosphere. These phenomena should therefore be\ntreated in a unified way.\n", "  Principal component analysis is performed on Birkeland or field-aligned\ncurrent (FAC) measurements from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary\nElectrodynamics Response Experiment. Principal component analysis (PCA)\nidentifies the patterns in the FACs that respond coherently to different\naspects of geomagnetic activity. The regions 1 and 2 current system is shown to\nbe the most reproducible feature of the currents, followed by cusp currents\nassociated with magnetic tension forces on newly reconnected field lines. The\ncusp currents are strongly modulated by season, indicating that their strength\nis regulated by the ionospheric conductance at the foot of the field lines. PCA\ndoes not identify a pattern that is clearly characteristic of a substorm\ncurrent wedge. Rather, a superposed epoch analysis of the currents associated\nwith substorms demonstrates that there is not a single mode of response, but a\ncomplicated and subtle mixture of different patterns.\n", "  We measure the flux density, composition, and energy of outflowing ions above\nthe polar cap, accelerated by quasi-static electric fields parallel to the\nmagnetic field and associated with polar cap arcs, using Cluster. Mapping the\nspacecraft position to its ionospheric foot point, we analyze the dependence of\nthese parameters on the solar zenith angle (SZA). We find a clear transition at\nSZA between We find a clear transition at SZA between $\\sim$94$^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim$107$^{\\circ}$, with the O$^{+}$ flux higher above the sunlit ionosphere.\nThis dependence on the illumination of the local ionosphere indicates that\nsignificant O$^{+}$ upflow occurs locally above the polar ionosphere. The same\nis found for H$^{+}$, but to a lesser extent. This effect can result in a\nseasonal variation of the total ion upflow from the polar ionosphere.\nFurthermore, we show that low-magnitude field-aligned potential drops are\npreferentially observed above the sunlit ionosphere, suggesting a feedback\neffect of ionospheric conductivity.\n", "  Recently it was discovered that the non-uniform Meissner current flowing\naround the pinning sites in the type-II superconductor induces the\nunconventional vortex-antivortex pairs with the non-quantized magnetic flux\n[J.-Y. Ge, et al., Nat. Commun. 6, 6573 (2015)]. Here we provide the theory of\nthis phenomenon showing that the vortex-like structures originate from the\nperturbation of the current streamlines by the non-superconducting defect,\nwhich results in the generation of the localized magnetic field. The position\nand the shape of such vortex dipoles are shown to be very sensitive to the\ndefect form. Thus, applying the external magnetic field or current to the\nsuperconductor and using, e.g., the high-resolution scanning Hall microscope to\nmeasure the stray magnetic field one can plot the map containing the\ninformation about the position of the defects and their shape.\n", "  2015 will see the first observations of Advanced LIGO and the start of the\ngravitational-wave (GW) advanced-detector era. One of the most promising\nsources for ground-based GW detectors are binary neutron-star (BNS)\ncoalescences. In order to use any detections for astrophysics, we must\nunderstand the capabilities of our parameter-estimation analysis. By simulating\nthe GWs from an astrophysically motivated population of BNSs, we examine the\naccuracy of parameter inferences in the early advanced-detector era. We find\nthat sky location, which is important for electromagnetic follow-up, can be\ndetermined rapidly (~5 s), but that sky areas may be hundreds of square\ndegrees. The degeneracy between component mass and spin means there is\nsignificant uncertainty for measurements of the individual masses and spins;\nhowever, the chirp mass is well measured (typically better than 0.1%).\n", "  Many years ago we have introduced into general relativity, {\\bf GR}, the\ncanonical superenergy tensors, $S_i^{~k}$, and the canonical angular\nsupermomentum tensors, $S^{ikl}=(-)S^{kil}$, matter and gravitation. We have\nobtained these tensors by special averaging of the differences of the canonical\nenergy-momentum and canonical angular momentum. The averaging was performed in\nRiemann normal coordinates, {\\bf RNC(P)}; {\\bf P} is beginning of these\ncoordinates. About four years ago we have observed that these tensors can also\nbe obtained in other, simpler way, by using the canonical superenergy and\nangular super momentum complexes, $_K S_i^{~k}$, and, $_K S~^{ikl}=(-)_K\nS^{kil}$, respectively. Such complexes can be introduced into {\\bf GR} in a\nnatural way starting from canonical energy-momentum and angular momentum\ncomplexes.\n  In this paper, at first, we define the canonical superenergy and angular\nsupermomentum complexes in {\\bf GR} and then, we apply them to analyze of a\nclosed system, {\\bf CS}, Trautman's radiative spacetimes, {\\bf TRS}, and\nFriedman universes, {\\bf FU}. Finally, we compare these complexes and the\nresults obtained with their help with the canonical superenergy and angular\nsupermomentum tensors and results obtained with them in past. In Appendix, for\nconvenience, we summarize our old approach to canonical superenergy and angular\nsupermomentum tensors.\n", "  Two decades after the discovery of 51 Peg b, the formation processes and\natmospheres of short-period gas giants remain poorly understood. Observations\nof eccentric systems provide key insights on those topics as they can\nilluminate how a planet's atmosphere responds to changes in incident flux. We\nreport here the analysis of multi-day multi-channel photometry of the eccentric\n(e~ 0.93) hot Jupiter HD 80606 b obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The\nplanet's extreme eccentricity combined with the long coverage and exquisite\nprecision of new periastron-passage observations allow us to break the\ndegeneracy between the radiative and dynamical timescales of HD 80606 b's\natmosphere and constrain its global thermal response. Our analysis reveals that\nthe atmospheric layers probed heat rapidly (~4 hr radiative timescale) from\n$\\lt$500 to 1400 K as they absorb ~ 20% of the incoming stellar flux during the\nperiastron passage, while the planet's rotation period is 93$\\pm_{35}^{85}$ hr,\nwhich exceeds the predicted pseudo-synchronous period (40 hr).\n", "  A strong from of invariance under a group G is manifested in a family over\nthe classifying space BG. We advocate a differential-geometric avatar of BG\nwhen G is a Lie group. Applied to G-equivariant connections on smooth principal\nor vector bundles, the equivariance-->families principle converts the\nG-equivariant extensions of curvature and Chern-Weil forms to the standard\nnonequivariant versions. An application of this technique yields the moment map\nof the determinant line of a G-equivariant Dirac operator, which in turn sheds\nlight on some anomaly formulas in quantum field theory.\n", "  On the optical absorption and the density of states of Frenkel exciton\nsystems on square, rectangular, and triangular lattices with nearest-neighbor\ninteractions and a Gaussian distribution of transition frequencies. The\nanalysis is based on an elliptic integral approach that gives results over the\nentire spectrum. It is found that the absorption is weakly affected by the\nanisotropy in contrast to the density of states where the effects can be much\nstronger. The results for the square lattice are in good agreement with the\nfinite array calculations of Schreiber and Toyozawa. Our findings suggest that\nthe coherent potential approximation can be useful in interpreting the optical\nproperties of two-dimensional systems with dominant nearest-neighbor\ninteractions and Gaussian diagonal disorder where the optically excited states\nare Frenkel excitons.\n", "  This article presents microscopic derivation of the Kraus operators for (the\ngeneralized) amplitude and phase damping process. Derivation is based on the\nrecently developed method [Andersson et al, J. Mod.Opt. 54, 1695 (2007)] which\nconcerns finite dimensional systems (e.g. qubit). The form of these operators\nis usually estimated without insight into the microscopic details of the\ndynamics. The behavior of the qubit dynamics is simulated and depicted via\nBloch sphere change.\n", "  By solving the Boltzmann transport equation we investigate theoretically the\ngeneral form of oscillations in the resistivity caused by varying the direction\nof an applied magnetic field for the case of quasi-two dimensional systems on\nhexagonal lattices. The presence of the angular magnetoresistance oscillations\ncan be used to map out the topology of the Fermi surface and we study how this\neffect varies as a function of the degree of interplane warping as well as a\nfunction of the degree of isotropic scattering. We find that the angular\ndependent effect due to in-plane rotation follows the symmetry imposed by the\nlattice whereas for inter-plane rotation the degree of warping dictates the\ndominant features observed in simulations. Our calculations make predictions\nfor specific angle-dependent magnetotransport signatures in magnetic fields\nexpected for quasi-two dimensional hexagonal compounds similar to PdCoO2 and\nPtCoO2.\n", "  Bifacial tandem cells promise to reduce three fundamental losses\n(above-bandgap, below bandgap, and the uncollected light between panels)\ninherent in classical single junction PV systems. The successive filtering of\nlight through the bandgap cascade, and requirement of current continuity make\noptimization of tandem cells difficult, accessible only to numerical solution\nthrough computer modeling. The challenge is even more complicated for bifacial\ndesign. In this paper, we use an elegantly simple Markov chain approach to show\nthat the essential physics of optimization is intuitively obvious, and deeply\ninsightful results can obtained analytically with a few lines of algebra. This\npowerful approach reproduces, as special cases, all the known results of\ntraditional/bifacial tandem cells, and highlights the asymptotic efficiency\ngain of these technologies.\n", "  We present version two of the Latex graphical style file Axodraw. It has a\nnumber of new drawing primitives and many extra options, and it can now work\nwith \\program{pdflatex} to directly produce output in PDF file format (but with\nthe aid of an auxiliary program).\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets are nanoscale, topologically-protected\nmagnetization swirls that are promising candidates for spintronics memory\ncarriers. Therefore, observing and manipulating the skyrmion state on the\nsurface level of the materials are of great importance for future applications.\nHere, we report a controlled way of creating a multidomain skyrmion state near\nthe surface of a Cu$_{2}$OSeO$_{3}$ single crystal, observed by soft resonant\nelastic x-ray scattering. This technique is an ideal tool to probe the magnetic\norder at the $L_{3}$ edge of $3d$ metal compounds giving a depth sensitivity of\n${\\sim}50$ nm. The single-domain sixfold-symmetric skyrmion lattice can be\nbroken up into domains overcoming the propagation directions imposed by the\ncubic anisotropy by applying the magnetic field in directions deviating from\nthe major cubic axes. Our findings open the door to a new way to manipulate and\nengineer the skyrmion state locally on the surface, or on the level of\nindividual skyrmions, which will enable applications in the future.\n", "  The received wisdom in statistical mechanics is that isolated systems, when\nleft to themselves, approach equilibrium. But under what circumstances does an\nequilibrium state exist and an approach to equilibrium take place? In this\npaper we address these questions from the vantage point of the long-run\nfraction of time definition of Boltzmannian equilibrium that we developed in\ntwo recent papers (Werndl and Frigg 2015a, 2015b). After a short summary of\nBoltzmannian statistical mechanics and our definition of equilibrium, we state\nan existence theorem which provides general criteria for the existence of an\nequilibrium state. We first illustrate how the theorem works with a toy\nexample, which allows us to illustrate the various elements of the theorem in a\nsimple setting. After commenting on the ergodic programme, we discuss\nequilibria in a number of different gas systems: the ideal gas, the dilute gas,\nthe Kac gas, the stadium gas, the mushroom gas and the multi-mushroom gas. In\nthe conclusion we briefly summarise the main points and highlight open\nquestions.\n", "  Recently, with the availability of various traffic datasets, human mobility\nhas been studied in different contexts. Researchers attempt to understand the\ncollective behaviors of human movement with respect to the spatio-temporal\ndistribution in traffic dynamics, from which a gravitational scaling law\ncharacterizing the relation between the traffic flow, population and distance\nhas been found. However, most studies focus on the integrated properties of\ngravitational scaling, neglecting its dynamical evolution during different\nhours of a day. Investigating the hourly traffic flow data of Beijing subway\nnetwork, based on the hop-count distance of passengers, we find that the\nscaling exponent of the gravitational law is smaller in Beijing subway system\ncompared to that reported in Seoul subway system. This means that traffic\ndemand in Beijing is much stronger and less sensitive to the travel distance.\nFurthermore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the scaling exponents in\nweekdays and weekends. Our findings may help to understand and improve the\ntraffic congestion control in different subway systems.\n", "  We report on the observation of metallic behavior in thin films of\noxygen-deficient SrTiO$_3$ - down to 9 unit cells - when coherently strained on\n(001) SrTiO$_3$ or DyScO$_3$-buffered (001) SrTiO$_3$ substrates. These films\nhave carrier concentrations of up to 2$\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$ and mobilities\nof up to 19,000 cm$^2$/V-s at 2 K. There exists a non-conducting layer in our\nSrTiO$_{3-\\delta}$ films that is larger in films with lower carrier\nconcentrations. This non-conducting layer can be attributed to a surface\ndepletion layer due to a Fermi level pinning potential. The depletion width,\ntransport, and structural properties are not greatly affected by the insertion\nof a DyScO$_3$ buffer between the SrTiO$_3$ film and SrTiO$_3$ substrate.\n", "  The Energy Losses and Ranges of magnetic monopoles with magnetic charges\n$1g_{D}$, $2g_{D}$, $3g_{D}$, $6g_{D}$ and $9g_{D}$ in Aluminum, Iron and in\nCopper are computed, in the different regimes of velocities. The Restricted\nEnergy Losses of monopoles with magnetic charges $1g_{D}$, $2g_{D}$ and\n$3g_{D}$ in Nuclear Track Detector is also given.\n", "  The MILC Collaboration has completed production running of electromagnetic\neffects on light mesons using asqtad improved staggered quarks. In these\ncalculations, we use quenched photons in the noncompact formalism. We study\nfour lattice spacings from $\\approx\\!0.12\\:$fm to $\\approx\\!0.045\\:$fm. To\nstudy finite-volume effects, we used six spatial lattice sizes $L/a=12$, 16,\n20, 28, 40, and 48, at $a\\!\\approx\\!0.12\\:$fm. We update our preliminary values\nfor the correction to Dashen's theorem ($\\epsilon$) and the quark-mass ratio\n$m_u/m_d$.\n", "  We continue our investigation of the phenomenological consequences of the\nMCPM for the LHC experiments. As in any two-Higgs-doublet model we have in the\nMCPM three neutral Higgs bosons and one charged Higgs-boson pair $H^\\pm$. Here\nwe discuss the two-photon production in proton-proton collisions. We find that\nin the MCPM a resonance-type structure in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ invariant mass\ndistribution is predicted around twice the $H^\\pm$ mass $m_{H^\\pm}$ with a\nwidth $2\\; \\Gamma_H$ where $\\Gamma_H$ is the $H^\\pm$ width. If we set\n$m_{H^\\pm} = 375$ GeV, the above resonance structure appears at 750 GeV with a\nwidth of about 45 GeV. We point out various predictions of the MCPM which\nfollow in such a scenario and which can be checked at the LHC.\n", "  This work describes the modelling of the 3D structure and position-velocity\n(P-V) diagrams of NGC 2440, a well known planetary nebula, aiming to describe\nthe morphology of this object, specially its core. We have used high resolution\nspectra and P-V diagrams to reproduce the 3D structure of the nebula using\nSHAPE, a software that allows 3D modelling. HST high angular resolution images\nwere used as reference to the model.\n  The observational data point to a segmented core, and the simulations confirm\nthis assumption; the best model for the nebula is a torus segmented in three\npieces. The simulated P-V diagrams agree with the observations. We suggest that\nthe torus was torn apart by interaction with the surrounding medium, either as\nwinds or the radiation field.\n  For the two bipolar lobes, orientation angles to the plane of the sky of\n$27\\pm$5 and $-5\\pm3$ degrees, respectively for the bipolar components with PA\nof 85 and 35 degrees, were derived. No additional bipolar lobes were required\nto model the observed features of NGC 2440. A distance of $1.8 \\pm 0.5$ kpc was\nderived for the nebula using our velocity field for the toroidal structure.\nThese results are the first derived for NGC 2440 from modelling in a 3D\nenvironment.\n", "  We have extended our detailed survey of the local white dwarf population from\n20 pc to 25 pc, effectively doubling the sample volume, which now includes 232\nstars. In the process new stars within 20 pc have been added, a more uniform\nset of distance estimates as well as improved spectral and binary\nclassifications are available. The present 25 pc sample is estimated to be\nabout 68% complete (the corresponding 20 pc sample is now 86\\% complete). The\nspace density of white dwarfs is unchanged at 4.8 \\pm 0.5 x 10^{-3} pc^{-3}.\nThis new study includes a white dwarf mass distribution and luminosity function\nbased on the 232 stars in the 25 pc sample. We find a significant excess of\nsingle stars over systems containing one or more companions (74\\% vs 26\\%).\nThis suggests mechanisms that result in the loss of companions during binary\nsystem evolution. In addition this updated sample exhibits a pronounced\ndeficiency of nearby Sirius-Like systems. Eleven such systems were found within\nthe 20 pc volume vs, only one additional system found in the volume between 20\npc and 25 pc. An estimate of white dwarf birth rates during the last 8 Gyr is\nderived from individual remnant cooling ages. A discussion of likely ways new\nmembers of the local sample may be found is provided.\n", "  The chain of algebraic geometry constructions permits to transfer from the\nminimal surface with zero instability index, and from the lattice over the ring\nof cyclotomic integers to the tetra-block helix. The tetra-block is the\n7-vertex joining of four tetrahedra sharing common faces; it is considered as a\nbuilding unit for structures approximated by the chains of regular tetrahedra.\nThe minimality condition of the 7 - vertex tetrablock as a building unit is the\nconsequence of its unique mapping by the Klein's quartic (which is\ncharacterized by the minimal hyperbolic Schwartz triangle) into the minimal\nfinite projective geometry. The topological stability of this helix provided by\nthe pitch to radius ratio H/R of 2{\\pi}/({\\tau}+1) ({\\tau} is the golden\nsection) and by the local rotation axis order of 40/11=40exp(-H/R). These\nparameters determine the helix of C{\\alpha} atoms inside the alpha - helix with\nthe accuracy of up to 2%. They explain also the bonding relationship i -- i+4\nbetween the i-th amide group and the (i+4)-th carbonil group of the residues in\nthe peptide chain and the observed value of the average segment length of the\nalpha-helix which is equal to 11 residues. The tetra-block helix with the N,\nC{\\alpha}, C', O, H atoms in the symmetrically selected positions, determines\nthe structure of the alpha - helix. The proposed approach can display\nadequately the symmetry of the helicoidal biopolymers.\n", "  Nanoparticles (NPs) are widely used in diverse application areas, such as\nmedicine, engineering, and cosmetics. The size (or volume) of NPs is one of the\nmost important parameters for their successful application. It is relatively\nstraightforward to determine the volume of regular NPs such as spheres and\ncubes from a one-dimensional or two-dimensional measurement. However, due to\nthe three-dimensional nature of NPs, it is challenging to determine the proper\nphysical size of many types of regularly and irregularly-shaped NPs (IS-NPs) at\nhigh-throughput using a single tool. Here, we present a relatively simple\nmethod that statistically determines a better volume estimate of many types of\nNPs by combining measurements from their top-down projection areas and\npeak-heights using two tools. The proposed method is significantly faster and\nmore economical than the electron tomography method. We demonstrate the\nimproved accuracy of the combined method over scanning electron microscopy\n(SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) by using both modeling and\nmeasurements. This study also shows that SEM provides a more accurate estimate\nof size than AFM for most IS-NP size measurements. The method provides a much\nneeded, proper high-throughput volumetric measurement method useful for many\napplications.\n"]}
