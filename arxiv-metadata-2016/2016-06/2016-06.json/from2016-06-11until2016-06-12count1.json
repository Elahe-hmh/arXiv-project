Our\ninvestigation results indicate that if N=1, the quantum gravity tensor equation\nreturns to Schrodinger integral equation. When N becomes sufficiently large, it\nis equivalent to Einstein field equation. This illustrates formal unification\nand intrinsic compatibility of general relativity with quantum mechanics. The\nquantum gravity equation may be utilized to deduce general relativity, special\nrelativity, Newtonian mechanics and quantum mechanics, which has paved the way\nfor unification of theoretical physics.\n"]}
