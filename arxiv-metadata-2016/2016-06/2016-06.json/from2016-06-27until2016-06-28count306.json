system of two atoms and\ntwo photon modes in vacuum, using the Jaynes-Cummings model in the\nrotating-wave approximation. It is found, by generalizing the existing results,\nthat the strength of entanglement is a periodic function of time. We explicitly\nshow that our results are in agreement with the existing results of\nentanglement conditions under appropriate limits. Results for the two-atom and\ntwo-photon system are generalized to the case of arbitrary values for the\natomic energies, corresponding to photon modes frequencies. Though it is\napparently a generalization of the existing work, we have considered for the\nfirst time both the resonant and nonresonant conditions and found a general\nequation which could be true for both cases. Moreover, we show that periodicity\nof the entanglement is a distinct feature of resonant system. Considering the\ntwo atoms and two photons system, in detail, we setup an approach which could\nbe generalized for many particle systems and the resulting master equation can\nalso be analyzed.\n", "  We study the action of metaplectic operators on Wiener amalgam spaces, giving\nupper bounds for their norms. As an application, we obtain new fixed-time\nestimates in these spaces for Schr\\\"odinger equations with general quadratic\nHamiltonians and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with\npotentials $V(x)=\\pm|x|^2$.\n", "  We deal with fixed-time and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\\\"odinger\npropagator as an operator on Wiener amalgam spaces. We discuss the sharpness of\nthe known estimates and we provide some new estimates which generalize the\nclassical ones. As an application, we present a result on the wellposedness of\nthe linear Schr\\\"odinger equation with a rough time dependent potential.\n", "  By substituting the Fe with the 5d-transition metal Ir in SrFe2As2, we have\nsuccessfully synthesized the superconductor SrFe2-xIrxAs2 with Tc = 22.3 K at x\n= 0.5. X-ray diffraction indicates that the material has formed the\nThCr2Si2-type structure with a space group I4/mmm. The temperature dependence\nof resistivity and dc magnetization both reveal sharp superconducting\ntransitions at around 22 K. An estimate on the diamagnetization signal reveals\na high Meissner shielding volume. Interestingly, the normal state resistivity\nexhibits a roughly linear behavior up to 300 K. The superconducting transitions\nat different magnetic fields were also measured yielding a slope of -dHc2/dT =\n3.8 T/K near Tc. Using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formula, the upper\ncritical field at zero K is found to be about 58 T. Counting the possible\nnumber of electrons doped into the system in SrFe2-xIrxAs2, we argue that the\nsuperconductivity in the Ir-doped system is different from the Co-doped case,\nwhich should add more ingredients to the underlying physics of the iron\npnictide superconductors.\n", "  By using solid state reaction method, we have synthesized the Pd-doped\nsuperconductor SrFe2-xPdxAs2. The systematic evolution of the lattice constants\nindicated that the Fe ions were successfully replaced by the Pd. By increasing\nthe doping content of Pd, the antiferromagnetic state of the parent phase is\nsuppressed and superconductivity is induced at a doping level of about x=0.05.\nSuperconductivity with a maximum transition temperature Tc of about 8.7 K was\nachieved at the doping level of x = 0.15. The general phase diagram of Tc\nversus x was obtained and found to be similar to the case of Ni and Co doping\nto the Fe sites. Our results suggest that superconductivity can be easily\ninduced in the FeAs family by adding electrons into the system, regardless with\nthe transition metals of 3d or higher d-orbital electrons.\n", "  By doping Rh to the Fe sites in SrFe2As2, superconductivity is induced when\nthe antiferromagnetic (AF) order is suppressed. The maximum superconducting\ntransition temperature was found at about 22 K with the doping level of x =\n0.25. It is found that the resistivity anomaly associating with the AF order\nreveals a sharp drop for the parent phase and the samples with low doping (x =\n0.05), while it evolves into an uprising at a higher doping level (x = 0.1). A\ngeneral phase diagram is depicted which exhibits the similarity with that of Co\ndoping. Regarding the close maximum superconducting transition temperatures in\ndoping Co, Rh and Ir, we argue that the superconductivity is intimately related\nto the suppression of the AF order, rather than the electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  By substituting the Fe with the 4d and 5d-transition metals Rh, Ir and Pd in\nSrFe_2As_2, we have successfully synthesized a series of superconductors\nSrFe_{2-x}M_xAs_2 (M = Rh, Ir and Pd) and explored the phase diagrams of them.\nThe systematic evolution of the lattice constants indicated that part of the Fe\nions were successfully replaced by the transition metals Rh, Ir and Pd. By\nincreasing the doping content of Rh, Ir and Pd, the antiferromagnetic state of\nthe parent phase is suppressed progressively and superconductivity is induced.\nThe general phase diagrams were obtained and found to be similar to the case of\ndoping Co and Ni to the Fe sites. However, the detailed structure of the phase\ndiagram, in terms of how fast to suppress the antiferromagnetic order and\ninduce the superconductivity, varies from one kind of doped element to another.\nRegarding the close values of the maximum superconducting transition\ntemperatures in doping Co, Rh and Ir which locate actually in the same column\nin the periodic table of elements but have very different masses, we argue that\nthe superconductivity is intimately related to the suppression of the AF order,\nrather than the electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  Sr2VO{3-delta}FeAs superconductors with different oxygen deficiencies have\nbeen successfully fabricated. It is found that the superconducting transition\ntemperature drops down monotonically with the increase of oxygen deficiency.\nThe diminishing of superconductivity is accompanied by the enhancement of\nresidual resistivity, indicating an unraveled scattering effect induced by the\noxygen deficiency. The highest superconducting transition temperature at about\n40 K is achieved near the stoichiometrical sample Sr$_2$VO$_{3}$FeAs.\nSurprisingly, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the\nvanadium has a \"5+\" valence state in the samples. The Hall effect measurements\nreveal that the density of charge carriers (electron-like here) varies\nqualitatively with the increase of oxygen deficiency. Magnetotransport\nmeasurements show that the superconducting transition changes from\none-step-like shape at low fields to two-step-like one at high fields,\nindicating a high anisotropy.\n", "  We study the Lifshitz type extension of the standard model (SM) at UV, with\ndynamical critical exponent z=3. One loop radiative corrections to the Higgs\nmass in such a model is calculated. Our result shows that, the Hierarchy\nproblem, which has initiated many excellent extension of the minimal SM, can be\nweakened in the z=3 Lifshitz type quantum field theory.\n", "  We examine the impact of a solid sphere into a fine-grained granular bed.\nUsing high-speed X-ray radiography we track both the motion of the sphere and\nlocal changes in the bed packing fraction. Varying the initial packing density\nas well as the ambient gas pressure, we find a complete reversal in the effect\nof interstitial gas on the impact response of the bed: The dynamic coupling\nbetween gas and grains allows for easier penetration in initially loose beds\nbut impedes penetration in more densely packed beds. High-speed imaging of the\nlocal packing density shows that these seemingly incongruous effects have a\ncommon origin in the resistance to bed packing changes caused by interstitial\nair.\n", "  We consider direct diphoton production in hadron collisions, and we compute\nthe next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections at the\nfully-differential level. Our calculation uses the $q_T$ subtraction formalism\nand it is implemented in a parton level Monte Carlo program. The program allows\nthe user to apply arbitrary kinematical cuts on the final-state photons and the\nassociated jet activity, and to compute the corresponding distributions in the\nform of bin histograms. We present selected numerical results related to Higgs\nboson searches at the LHC and corresponding results at the Tevatron.\n", "  Using an advanced tight-binding approach, we estimate the anisotropy of the\ntunnel transmission associated with the rotation of the 5/2 spin of a single Mn\natom forming an acceptor state in GaAs and located near an AlGaAs tunnel\nbarrier. Significant anisotropies in both in-plane and out-of-plane geometries\nare found, resulting from the combination of the large spin-orbit coupling\nassociated with the p-d exchange interaction, cubic anisotropy of heavy-hole\ndispersion and the low C2v symmetry of the chemical bonds.\n", "  We develop the theory of linear algebra over a (Z_2)^n-commutative algebra (n\nin N), which includes the well-known super linear algebra as a special case\n(n=1). Examples of such graded-commutative algebras are the Clifford algebras,\nin particular the quaternion algebra H. Following a cohomological approach, we\nintroduce analogues of the notions of trace and determinant. Our construction\nreduces in the classical commutative case to the coordinate-free description of\nthe determinant by means of the action of invertible matrices on the top\nexterior power, and in the supercommutative case it coincides with the\nwell-known cohomological interpretation of the Berezinian.\n", "  We study the dependence of the dimensional character of the charge-density\nwave (CDW) in TiSe$_2$ by a controlled variation of the number of available\ncharge carriers in the conduction band. A change of dimensionality is realised\nby H2O exposure and monitored by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The\nCDW spanning vector changes from 2x2x1 towards 1x1x2 in a narrow population\nrange, just before a complete suppression of the CDW. Our findings enable a new\nview on the excitonic origin of the CDW, the relation between CDW spanning\nvector and periodic lattice distortion, and suggest modifications in the\npicture of the recently discovered chirality of the CDW.\n", "  We present the mass formula for heavy-light charm meson for one loop, using\nheavy quark effective theory. Formulating an effective Lagrangian, the masses\nof the ground state heavy mesons have been studied in the heavy quark limit\nincluding leading corrections from finite heavy quark masses and nonzero light\nquark masses using a constrained fit for the eight equation having eleven\nparameters including three coupling constants g, h and g'. Masses determined\nfrom this approach is fitted to the experimentally known decay widths to\nestimate the strong coupling constants, showing a better match with available\ntheoretical and experimental data\n", "  We study one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators with complex measures as\npotentials and present an improved criterion for absence of eigenvalues which\ninvolves a weak local periodicity condition. The criterion leads to sharp\nquantitative bounds on the eigenvalues. We apply our result to quasiperiodic\nmeasures as potentials.\n", "  Models of porous media are often applied to relatively small systems, which\nleads not only to system-size-dependent results, but also to phenomena that\nwould be absent in larger systems. Here we investigate one such finite-size\neffect: anisotropy of the permeability tensor. We show that a non-zero angle\nbetween the external body force and macroscopic flux vector exists in\nthree-dimensional periodic models of sizes commonly used in computer\nsimulations and propose a criterion, based on the system size to the grain size\nratio, for this phenomenon to be relevant or negligible. The finite-size\nanisotropy of the porous matrix induces a pressure gradient perpendicular to\nthe axis of a porous duct and we analyze how this effect scales with the system\nand grain sizes.\n", "  We study Schr\\\"odinger operators on $\\R$ with measures as potentials.\n  Choosing a suitable subset of measures we can work with a dynamical system\nconsisting of measures. We then relate properties of this dynamical system with\nspectral properties of the associated operators.\n  The constant spectrum in the strictly ergodic case coincides with the union\nof the zeros of the Lyapunov exponent and the set of non-uniformities of the\ntransfer matrices.\n  This result enables us to prove Cantor spectra of zero Lebesgue measure for a\nlarge class of operator families, including many operator families generated by\naperiodic subshifts.\n", "  We propose a new model about diffusion of a product which includes a memory\nof how many adopters or advertisements a non-adopter met, where (non-)adopters\nmean people (not) possessing the product. This effect is lacking in the Bass\nmodel. As an application, we utilize the model to fit the iPod sales data, and\nso the better agreement is obtained than the Bass model.\n", "  Using the measurement-based quantum computation model, we construct\ninteractive proofs with non-communicating quantum provers and a classical\nverifier. Our construction gives interactive proofs for all languages in BQP\nwith a polynomial number of quantum provers, each of which, in the honest case,\nperforms only a single measurement.\n  Our techniques use self-tested graph states. In this regard we introduce two\nimportant improvements over previous work. Specifically, we derive new error\nbounds which scale polynomially with the size of the graph compared with\nexponential dependence on the size of the graph in previous work. We also\nextend the self-testing error bounds on measurements to a very general set\nwhich includes the adaptive measurements used for measurement-based quantum\ncomputation as a special case.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to reveal hidden structures on the singular\ncohomology and the Griffiths period integral of a smooth projective\nhypersurface in terms of BV(Batalin-Vilkovisky) algebras and homotopy Lie\ntheory (so called, $L_\\infty$-homotopy theory).\n  Let $X_G$ be a smooth projective hypersurface in the complex projective space\n$\\mathbf{P}^n$ defined by a homogeneous polynomial $G(\\underline x)$ of degree\n$d \\geq 1$. Let $\\mathbb{H}=H^{n-1}_{\\operatorname{prim}}(X_G, \\mathbb{C})$ be\nthe middle dimensional primitive cohomology of $X_G$. We explicitly construct a\nBV algebra $\\mathbf{B\\!\\!V}_{\\! \\!X}=(\\mathcal{A}_X,Q_X, K_X)$ such that its\n$0$-th cohomology $H^0_{K_X}(\\mathcal{A}_X)$ is canonically isomorphic to\n$\\mathbb{H}$. We also equip $\\mathbf{B\\!\\!V}_{\\! \\!X}$ with a decreasing\nfiltration and a bilinear pairing which realize the Hodge filtration and the\ncup product polarization on $\\mathbb{H}$ under the canonical isomorphism.\nMoreover, we lift $C_{[\\gamma]}:\\mathbb{H} \\to \\mathbb{C}$ to a cochain map\n$\\mathcal{C}_\\gamma:(\\mathcal{A}_X, K_X) \\to (\\mathbb{C},0)$, where\n$C_{[\\gamma]}$ is the Griffiths period integral given by $\\omega \\mapsto\n\\int_\\gamma \\omega$ for $[\\gamma]\\in H_{n-1}(X_G,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n  We use this enhanced homotopy structure on $\\mathbb{H}$ to study an extended\nformal deformation of $X_G$ and the correlation of its period integrals. If\n$X_G$ is in a formal family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces $X_{G_{\\underline T}}$,\nwe provide an explicit formula and algorithm (based on a Gr\\\"obner basis) to\ncompute the period matrix of $X_{G_{\\underline T}}$ in terms of the period\nmatrix of $X_G$ and an $L_\\infty$-morphism $\\underline \\kappa$ which enhances\n$C_{[\\gamma]}$ and governs deformations of period matrices.\n", "  We demonstrate a trade-off between linewidth and loss-of-lock frequency in a\nmode-locked laser employing active feedback to control the carrier-envelope\noffset phase difference. In frequency metrology applications, the linewidth\ntranslates directly to uncertainty in the measured frequency, while the impact\nof lock loss and recovery on the measured frequency is less well understood. We\nreduce the dynamics to stochastic differential equations, specifically\ndiffusion processes, and compare the linearized linewidth to the rate of lock\nloss determined by the mean time to exit calculated from large deviation\ntheory.\n", "  The properties of neutral acceptor states in zinc-blende semiconductors are\nre-examined in the frame of extended-basis $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight-binding model.\nThe symmetry discrepancy between envelope function theory and atomistic\ncalculations is explained in terms of over symmetric potential in current\nk$\\cdot$p approaches. Spherical harmonics decomposition of microscopic Local\nDensity Of States (LDOS) allows for the direct analysis of the tight-binding\nresults in terms of envelope function. Lifting of degeneracy by strain and\nelectric field and their effect on LDOS is examined. The fine structure of\nmagnetic impurity caused by exchange interaction of hole with impurity\n$d$-shell and its dependence on strain is studied. It is shown that exchange\ninteraction by mixing heavy and light hole makes the ground state more\nisotropic. The results are important in the context of Scanning Tunneling\nMicroscopy (STM) images of subsurface impurities.\n", "  We present the galaxy number overdensity up to second order in redshift space\non cosmological scales for a concordance model. The result contains all general\nrelativistic effects up to second order that arise from observing on the past\nlight cone, including all redshift effects, lensing distortions from\nconvergence and shear, and contributions from velocities, Sachs-Wolfe,\nintegrated SW and time-delay terms. This result will be important for accurate\ncalculation of the bias on estimates of non-Gaussianity and on precision\nparameter estimates, introduced by nonlinear projection effects.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the magnetohydrodynamic viscous flow with\nsecond order slip flow model over a permeable shrinking surface. We have\nobtained the closed form of exact solution of Navier-Stokes equations by using\nsimilarity variable technique. The effects of slip, suction and magnetic\nparameter have been investigated in detail. The results show that there are two\nsolution branches, namely lower and upper solution branch. The behavior of\nvelocity and shear stress profiles for different values of slip, suction and\nmagnetic parameters has been discussed through graphs.\n", "  We present a detailed derivation of the observed galaxy number over-density\non cosmological scales up to second order in perturbation theory. We include\nall relativistic effects that arise from observing on the past lightcone. The\nderivation is in a general gauge, and applies to all dark energy models\n(including interacting dark energy) and many modified gravity models. The\nresult will be important for accurate cosmological parameter estimation,\nincluding non-Gaussianity, since all projection effects need to be taken into\naccount. It also offers the potential for new probes of General Relativity,\ndark energy and modified gravity. This paper accompanies Paper I which presents\nthe key results for the concordance model in Poisson gauge.\n", "  We present a formalism for simulating quantum dynamics of lattice spin-one\nsystems by first introducing local hidden variables and then doing\nsemiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation in the extended phase space. In\nthis way we exactly take into account the local on-site Hamiltonian and\napproximately treat spin-spin interactions. In particular, we represent each\nspin with eight classical SU(3) variables. Three of them represent the usual\nspin components and five others are hidden variables representing local\nspin-spin correlations. We compare our formalism with exact quantum dynamics of\nfully connected spin systems and find very good agreement. As an application we\ndiscuss quench dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model near the superfluid-insulator\ntransition for a 3D lattice system consisting of 1000 sites.\n", "  Advances in silicon photonics have resulted in rapidly increasing complexity\nof integrated circuits. New methods are desirable that allow direct\ncharacterization of individual optical components in-situ, without the need for\nadditional fabrication steps or test structures. Here, we present a new\ndevice-level method for characterization of photonic chips based on a highly\nlocalized modulation in the device using pulsed laser excitation. Optical\npumping perturbs the refractive index of silicon, providing a spatially and\ntemporally localized modulation in the transmitted light enabling time- and\nfrequency-resolved imaging. We demonstrate the versatility of this all-optical\nmodulation technique in imaging and in quantitative characterization of a\nvariety of properties of silicon photonic devices, ranging from group indices\nin waveguides, quality factors of a ring resonator to the mode structure of a\nmultimode interference device. Ultrafast photomodulation spectroscopy provides\nimportant information on devices of complex design, and is easily applicable\nfor testing on the device-level.\n", "  The simplest example of a quantum information source with memory is a mixed\nsource which emits signals entirely from one of two memoryless quantum sources\nwith given a priori probabilities. Considering a mixed source consisting of a\ngeneral one-parameter family of memoryless sources, we derive the second order\nasymptotic rate for fixed-length visible source coding. Furthermore, we\nspecialize our main result to a mixed source consisting of two memoryless\nsources. Our results provide the first example of second order asymptotics for\na quantum information-processing task employing a resource with memory. For the\ncase of a classical mixed source (using a finite alphabet), our results reduce\nto those obtained by Nomura and Han [IEEE Trans. on Inf. Th. 59.1 (2013), pp.\n1-16]. To prove the achievability part of our main result, we introduce\nuniversal quantum source codes achieving second order asymptotic rates. These\nare obtained by an extension of Hayashi's construction [IEEE Trans. on Inf. Th.\n54.10 (2008), pp. 4619-4637] of their classical counterparts.\n", "  Recent experimental progresses allow for exploring some important physical\nquantities of ultracold Fermi gases, such as the compressibility, spin\nsusceptibility, viscosity, optical conductivity and spin diffusivity.\nTheoretically, these quantities can be evaluated from suitable linear response\ntheories. For BCS superfluid, it has been found that the gauge invariant linear\nresponse theories can be fully consistent with some stringent consistency\nconstraints. When the theory is generalized to stronger-than-BCS regime, one\nmay meet serious difficulties to satisfy the gauge invariance conditions. In\nthis paper, we try to construct density and spin linear response theories which\nare formally gauge invariant for a Fermi gas undergoing BCS-Bose-Einstein\nCondensation (BEC) crossover, especially below the superfluid transition\ntemperature $T_c$. We adapt a particular $t$-matrix approach which is close to\nthe $G_0G$ formalism to incorporate non-condensed pairing in the normal state.\nWe explicitly show that the fundamental constraints imposed by the Ward\nidentities, $Q$-limit Ward identity are indeed satisfied.\n", "  We declare that we are living in the quantum 4-dimensional Minkowski\nspace-time with the force-fields gauge-group structure $SU_c(3) \\times SU_L(2)\n\\times U(1) \\times SU_f(3)$ built-in from the very beginning. From this overall\nbackground, we see the lepton world, which has the symmetry characterized by\n$SU_L(2) \\times U(1) \\times SU_f(3)$ - the lepton world is also called \"the\natomic world\". From the overall background, we also see the quark world, which\nexperiences the well-known $(123)$ symmetry, i.e., $SU_c(3) \\times SU_L((2)\n\\times U(1)$. The quark world is also called \"the nuclear world\".\n  The $3^\\circ\\,K$ cosmic microwave background (CMB) in our Universe provides\nthe evidence of that \"the force-fields gauge-group structure was built-in from\nthe very beginning\". The CMB is almost uniform, to the level of one part in\n$10^5$, reflecting the massless of the photons.\n  The lepton world is dimensionless in the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.\nThat is, all couplings are dimensionless. The quark world is also dimensionless\nin the 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time. Apart from the \"ignition\" term, the\ngauge and Higgs sector, i.e., the overall background, is also dimensionless.\nThus, apart the \"ignition\" term, our world as a whole is dimensionless in the\n4-dimensional Minkowski space-time - that is, it is the characteristic of the\nquantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time.\n", "  After a summary of Bohr's views and their relation to Kant's theory of\nscience, two fruitless lines of attack on the measurement problem are\ndiscussed: the way of the psi-ontologist and the way of the QBist. In the\nremainder of the paper the following results are obtained. (i) Because the\ntestable correlations between outcomes of measurements of macroscopic positions\nare consistent with both the classical and the quantum laws, there is no\nconflict between the superposition principle and the existence of measurement\noutcomes. (ii) Intrinsically, each fundamental particle is numerically\nidentical with every other fundamental particle. What presents itself here and\nnow with these properties and what presents itself there and then with those\nproperties is one and the same entity, herein called \"Being.\" (iii) The\ndistinction between a classical domain and a quantum domain is essentially a\ndistinction between the manifested world and its manifestation. By entering\ninto reflexive spatial relations, Being gives rise to (a) what looks like a\nmultiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is ignored,\nand (b) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial quality of the\nrelations is reified. (iv) The reason why quantum mechanics is a calculus of\ncorrelations between measurement outcomes is that it concerns the progressive\nrealization of distinguishable objects and distinguishable regions of space.\n(v) The key to the relation between quantum mechanics and experience is that\nBeing does not simply manifest the world, Being manifests the world to itself.\nIt is at once the single substance by which the world exists and the ultimate\nself or subject for which it exists. The question how we are related to this\nultimate self or subject is discussed.\n", "  The effect of Planck scale quantum geometrical effects on measurements with\ninterferometers is estimated with standard physics, and with a variety of\nproposed extensions. It is shown that effects are negligible in standard field\ntheory with canonically quantized gravity. Statistical noise levels are\nestimated in a variety of proposals for non-standard metric fluctuations, and\nthese alternatives are constrained using upper bounds on stochastic metric\nfluctuations from LIGO. Idealized models of several interferometer system\narchitectures are used to predict signal noise spectra in a quantum geometry\nthat cannot be described by a fluctuating metric, in which position noise\narises from holographic bounds on directional information. Predictions in this\ncase are shown to be close to current and projected experimental bounds.\n", "  In this article, we propose a finite volume limiter function for a\nreconstruction on the three-point stencil. Compared to classical limiter\nfunctions in the MUSCL framework, which yield $2^{\\text{nd}}$-order accuracy,\nthe new limiter is $3^\\text{rd}$-order accurate for smooth solutions. In an\nearlier work, such a $3^\\text{rd}$-order limiter function was proposed and\nshowed successful results [2]. However, it came with unspecified parameters. We\nclose this gap by giving information on these parameters.\n", "  We calculate the beating of $h/2e$ and $h/e$ periodic oscillations of the\nflux-dependent critical supercurrent $I_c(\\Phi)$ through a quantum spin-Hall\ninsulator between two superconducting electrodes. A conducting pathway along\nthe superconductor connects the helical edge channels via a non-helical\nchannel, allowing an electron incident on the superconductor along one edge to\nbe Andreev reflected along the opposite edge. In the limit of small Andreev\nreflection probability the resulting even-odd effect is described by\n$I_c\\propto|\\cos(e\\Phi/\\hbar)+f|$, with $|f|\\ll 1$ proportional to the\nprobability for phase-coherent inter-edge transmission. Because the sign of $f$\ndepends on microscopic details, a sample-dependent inversion of the alternation\nof large and small peaks is a distinctive feature of the beating mechanism for\nthe even-odd effect.\n", "  Recent advances in rapidly quenched ultracold atomic Fermi gases near a\nFeshbach resonance have brought about a number of interesting problems, in the\ncontext of observing the long-sought Stoner ferromagnetic phase transition. The\npossibility of experimentally obtaining a \"quasirepulsive\" regime in the upper\nbranch of the energy spectrum due to the rapid quench is currently being\ndebated, and the Stoner transition has mainly been investigated theoretically\nby using perturbation theory or at high polarization, due to the limited\ntheoretical approaches in the strongly repulsive regime. In this work, we\npresent a nonperturbative theoretical approach to the quasirepulsive upper\nbranch of a Fermi gas near a broad Feshbach resonance, and we determine the\nfinite-temperature phase diagram for the Stoner instability. Our results agree\nwell with the known quantum Monte-Carlo simulations at zero temperature, and we\nrecover the known virial expansion prediction at high temperature for arbitrary\ninteraction strengths. At resonance, we find that the Stoner transition\ntemperature becomes of the order of the Fermi temperature, around which the\nmolecule formation rate becomes vanishingly small. This suggests a feasible way\nto observe Stoner ferromagnetism in the nondegenerate temperature regime.\n", "  In Lorentz-Finsler geometry it is natural to define the Finsler Lagrangian\nover a cone (Asanov's approach) or over the whole slit tangent bundle (Beem's\napproach). In the former case one might want to add differentiability\nconditions at the boundary of the (timelike) cone in order to retain the usual\ndefinition of lightlike geodesics. It is shown here that if this is done then\nthe two theories coincide, namely the `conic' Finsler Lagrangian is the\nrestriction of a slit tangent bundle Lagrangian. Since causality theory depends\non curves defined through the future cone, this work establishes the essential\nuniqueness of (sufficiently regular) Finsler spacetime theories and Finsler\ncausality.\n", "  How can we design the shape of an object, in the framework of Newtonian\ngravity, in order to generate maximum gravity at a given point in space? In\nthis work we present a study on this interesting problem. We obtain compact\nsolutions for all dimensional cases. The results are commonly characterized by\na simple \"physical\" feature that any mass element unit on the object surface\ngenerates the same gravity strength at the considered point, in the direction\nalong the rotational symmetry axis.\n", "  Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was used to probe the surface\nchemistry of chlorine-terminated silicon nanocrystal (Si-NC) surfaces in an\nair-free environment. SERS effect was observed from the thin films of Ag$_x$O\nusing 514 nm laser wavelength. When a monolayer of Si-NCs were spin-coated on\nAg$_x$O SERS substrates, a very clear signal of surface states, including\nSi-Cl$_x$, and Si-H$_x$ were observed. Upon air-exposure, we observed the\ntemporal reduction of Si-Cl$_x$ peak intensity, and a development of\noxidation-related peak intensities, like Si-O$_x$ and Si-O-H$_x$. In addition,\nfirst, second and third order transverse optical (TO) modes of Si-NCs were also\nobserved at 519, 1000 and 1600 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. As a comparison, Raman\nanalysis of a thick film (> 200 nm) of Si-NCs deposited on ordinary glass\nsubstrates were performed. This analysis only demonstrated the first TO mode of\nSi-NCs, and the all the other features originated from SERS enhancement did not\nappear in the spectrum. These results conclude that, SERS is not only capable\nof single-molecule detection, but also a powerful technique for monitoring the\nsurface chemistry of nanoparticles.\n", "  In this paper, we will review the co-adjoint orbit formulation of finite\ndimensional quantum mechanics, and in this framework, we will interpret the\nnotion of quantum Fisher information index (and metric). Following previous\nwork of part of the authors, who introduced the definition of Fisher\ninformation tensor, we will show how its antisymmetric part is the pullback of\nthe natural Kostant-Kirillov-Souriau symplectic form along some natural\ndiffeomorphism. In order to do this, we will need to understand the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative as a proper 1-form, settling the issues about its very\ndefinition and explicit computation. Moreover, the fibration of co-adjoint\norbits, seen as spaces of mixed states, is also discussed.\n", "  The super-massive 4 million solar mass black hole Sagittarius~A* (SgrA*)\nshows flare emission from the millimeter to the X-ray domain. A detailed\nanalysis of the infrared light curves allows us to address the accretion\nphenomenon in a statistical way. The analysis shows that the near-infrared\nflare amplitudes are dominated by a single state power law, with the low states\nin SgrA* limited by confusion through the unresolved stellar background. There\nare several dusty objects in the immediate vicinity of SgrA*. The source G2/DSO\nis one of them. Its nature is unclear. It may be comparable to similar stellar\ndusty sources in the region or may consist predominantly of gas and dust. In\nthis case a particularly enhanced accretion activity onto SgrA* may be expected\nin the near future. Here the interpretation of recent data and ongoing\nobservations are discussed.\n", "  Cerenkov technology is often the optimal choice for particle identification\nin high energy particle collision applications. Typically, the most challenging\nregime is at high pseudorapidity (forward) where particle identification must\nperform well at high high laboratory momenta. For the upcoming Electron Ion\nCollider (EIC), the physics goals require hadron ($\\pi$, K, p) identification\nup to $\\sim$~50 GeV/c. In this region Cerenkov Ring-Imaging is the most viable\nsolution.\\newline The speed of light in a radiator medium is inversely\nproportional to the refractive index. Hence, for PID reaching out to high\nmomenta a small index of refraction is required. Unfortunately, the lowest\nindices of refraction also result in the lowest light yield\n($\\frac{dN_\\gamma}{dx} \\propto \\sin^2{\\left(\\theta_C \\right)}$) driving up the\nradiator length and thereby the overall detector cost. In this paper we report\non a successful test of a compact RICH detector (1 meter radiator) capable of\ndelivering in excess of 10 photoelectrons per ring with a low index radiator\ngas ($CF_4$). The detector concept is a natural extension of the PHENIX HBD\ndetector achieved by adding focusing capability at low wavelength and adequate\ngain for high efficiency detection of single-electron induced avalanches. Our\nresults indicate that this technology is indeed a viable choice in the forward\ndirection of the EIC. The setup and results are described within.\n", "  We consider semilinear equations of the form p(D)u=F(u), with a locally\nbounded nonlinearity F(u), and a linear part p(D) given by a Fourier\nmultiplier. The multiplier p(\\xi) is the sum of positively homogeneous terms,\nwith at least one of them non smooth. This general class of equations includes\nmost physical models for traveling waves in hydrodynamics, the Benjamin-Ono\nequation being a basic example. We prove sharp pointwise decay estimates for\nthe solutions to such equations, depending on the degree of the non smooth\nterms in p(\\xi). When the nonlinearity is smooth we prove similar estimates for\nthe derivatives of the solution, as well holomorphic extension to a strip, for\nanalytic nonlinearity.\n", "  We investigate the pumped charge and spin at zero-bias by adiabatic\nmodulation of two control parameters using the full counting statistics with\nquantum master equation approach. First we study higher order effects of the\npumping frequency in general Markov systems and show the equivalence between\nour approach and the real-time diagrammatic approach. An adiabatic modulation\nof the control parameters induces the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) phase. We\nshow that the origin of the BSN phase is a non-adiabatic effect. The\nadiabatically pumped charge (spin) is given by a summation of (i) a time\nintegral of the instantaneous steady charge (spin) current and (ii) a geometric\nsurface integral of the BSN curvature, which results from the BSN phase. In\nquantum dots (QDs) weakly coupled to two leads, we show that (i) is usually\ndominant if the thermodynamic parameters are modulated although it is zero if\nthe thermodynamic parameters are fixed to zero-bias. To observe the spin\neffects, we consider collinear magnetic fields, which relate to spins through\nthe Zeeman effect, with different amplitudes applying to the QDs and the leads.\nFor interacting one level QD, we calculate analytically the pumped charge and\nspin by modulating the magnetic fields and the coupling strengths to the leads\nin the weak and strong interacting limits. We show that the difference between\nthese two limits appears through the averages of the numbers of the electron\nwith up and down spin in the QD. For the quantum pump by the modulation of the\nmagnetic fields of the QD and one lead, the energy-dependences of linewidth\nfunctions, which are usually neglected, are essential.\n", "  In this paper we study the influence of an electric field on a two\ndimen-sional waveguide. We show that bound states that occur under a\ngeometrical deformation of the guide turn into resonances when we apply an\nelectric field of small intensity having a nonzero component on the\nlongitudinal direction of the system.

Existing extensions to affiliation\nnetworks, however, are sensitive to repeat group attendance, which manifests in\nbipartite models as biclique proliferation. Whereas this sensitivity does not\nreflect common interpretations of triadic closure in social networks, this\npaper proposes a measure of triadic closure in affiliation networks designed to\ncontrol for it. To avoid arbitrariness, the paper introduces a triadic\nframework for affiliation networks, within which a range of measures can be\ndefined; it then presents a set of basic axioms that suffice to narrow this\nrange to the one measure. An instrumental assessment compares the proposed and\ntwo existing measures for reliability, validity, redundancy, and practicality.\nAll three measures then take part in an investigation of three empirical social\nnetworks, which illustrates their differences.\n", "  Saari's homographic conjecture claims that, in the N-body problem under the\nhomogeneous potential, $U=\\alpha^{-1}\\sum m_i m_j/r_{ij}^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha\\ne\n0$, a motion having constant configurational measure $\\mu=I^{\\alpha/2}U$ is\nhomographic, where $I$ represents the moment of inertia defined by $I=\\sum m_i\nm_j r_{ij}^2/\\sum m_k$, $m_i$ the mass, and $r_{ij}$ the distance between\nparticles.\n  We prove this conjecture for general masses $m_k>0$ in the planar three-body\nproblem under Newton potential ($\\alpha=1$) and a strong force potential\n($\\alpha=2$).\n", "  We consider a class of Schrodinger equations with time-dependent smooth\nmagnetic and electric potentials having a growth at infinity at most linear and\nquadratic, respectively. We study the convergence in $L^p$ with loss of\nderivatives, $1<p<\\infty$, of the time slicing approximations of the\ncorresponding Feynman path integral. The results are completely sharp and hold\nfor long time, where no smoothing effect is available. The techniques are based\non the decomposition and reconstruction of functions and operators with respect\nto certain wave packets in phase space.\n", "  In a recent paper, Edelman, Guionnet and P\\'{e}ch\\'{e} conjectured a\nparticular $n^{-1}$ correction term of the smallest eigenvalue distribution of\nthe Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE) of order $n$ in the hard-edge scaling\nlimit: specifically, the derivative of the limit distribution, that is, the\ndensity, shows up in that correction term. We give a short proof by modifying\nthe hard-edge scaling to achieve an optimal $O(n^{-2})$ rate of convergence of\nthe smallest eigenvalue distribution. The appearance of the derivative follows\nthen by a Taylor expansion of the less optimal, standard hard-edge scaling. We\nrelate the $n^{-1}$ correction term further to the logarithmic derivative of\nthe Bessel kernel Fredholm determinant in the work of Tracy and Widom.\n", "  We discuss physical interpretation of {\\Lambda}CDM cosmology from a Machian\nmodel of the universe containing nothing but visible matter (ordinary matter,\nradiation). The Friedmann equation can be derived from a Machian definition of\nenergy, whereby both kinetic and potential energy of a particle are related to\nall cosmic matter-energy within the particle's gravitational horizon. The\ndistance to this horizon thus appears as a parameter in all forms of\nmatter-energy density. From conservation of Machian energy it follows that all\ndifferent types of matter-energy are uniformly characterized by \\rho\\propto\n1/a, i.e., by a constant deceleration q=-1/2. This coincides with relative\ndensities \\varOmega_{m}=1/3 and \\Omega_{\\Lambda}=2/3 of {\\Lambda}CDM. Thus the\nMachian cosmological model matches present relative densities of {\\Lambda}CDM,\nwithout invoking dark components.\n", "  We give an overview of the derivation of multipolar equations of motion of\nextended test bodies for a wide set of gravitational theories beyond the\nstandard general relativistic framework. The classes of theories covered range\nfrom simple generalizations of General Relativity, e.g. encompassing additional\nscalar fields, to theories with additional geometrical structures which are\nneeded for the description of microstructured matter. Our unified framework\neven allows to handle theories with nonminimal coupling to matter, and thereby\nfor a systematic test of a very broad range of gravitational theories.\n", "  We give explicit formulas for the elements of the center of the completed\nquantum affine algebra in type $A$ at the critical level which are associated\nwith the fundamental representations. We calculate the images of these elements\nunder a Harish-Chandra-type homomorphism. These images coincide with those in\nthe free field realization of the quantum affine algebra and reproduce\ngenerators of the $q$-deformed classical $W$-algebra of Frenkel and\nReshetikhin.\n", "  In this letter, we discuss a versatile, fully-reconfigurable experimental\nplatform for the investigation of phononic phenomena in metamaterial\narchitectures. The approach revolves around the use of 3D laser vibrometry to\nreconstruct global and local wavefield features in specimens obtained through\nsimple arrangements of LEGO$^{\\circledR}$ bricks on a thin baseplate. The\nagility by which it is possible to reconfigure the brick patterns into a nearly\nendless spectrum of topologies makes this an effective approach for rapid\nexperimental proof of concept, as well as a powerful didactic tool, in the\narena of phononic crystals and metamaterials engineering. We use our platform\nto provide a compelling visual illustration of important spatial wave\nmanipulation effects (waveguiding and seismic isolation), and to elucidate\nfundamental dichotomies between Bragg-based and locally resonant bandgap\nmechanisms.\n", "  Elastic scattering of relativistic electrons from the nucleon yields Lorentz\ninvariant form factors that describe the fundamental distribution of charge and\nmagnetism. The spatial dependence of the nucleon's charge and magnetism is\ntypically interpreted in the Breit reference frame which is related by a\nLorentz boost from the laboratory frame, where the nucleon is at rest. We\nconstruct a toy model to estimate how the charge and magnetic radii of the\nnucleon are modified between the Breit and lab. frames. This has implications\nfor the ratio of the proton electric to magnetic elastic form factors as a\nfunction of momentum transfer as well as for determinations of the proton\ncharge radius. Predicted corrections based on the model are provided for the\nrms charge radii of the deuteron, the triton, and the helium isotopes.\n", "  A link between the semiclassical Einstein equation and a maximal vacuum\nentanglement hypothesis is established. The hypothesis asserts that\nentanglement entropy in small geodesic balls is maximized at fixed volume in a\nlocally maximally symmetric vacuum state of geometry and quantum fields. A\nqualitative argument suggests that the Einstein equation implies validity of\nthe hypothesis. A more precise argument shows that, for first-order variations\nof the local vacuum state of conformal quantum fields, the vacuum entanglement\nis stationary if and only if the Einstein equation holds. For nonconformal\nfields, the same conclusion follows modulo a conjecture about the variation of\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  Recently we introduced T-duality in the study of topological insulators. In\nthis paper, we study the bulk-boundary correspondence for three phenomena in\ncondensed matter physics, namely, the quantum Hall effect, the Chern insulator,\nand time reversal invariant topological insulators. In all of these cases, we\nshow that T-duality trivializes the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n", "  We consider a possibility of a spontaneous generation of fourfold effective\ninteractions of electroweak gauge bosons $W^a$ and $B$. The conditions for the\nspontaneous generation are shown to lead to a set of compensation equations for\nparameters of the interaction. In case of a realization of a non-trivial\nsolution of the set, important electro-weak parameter $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ is\ndefined. The existence of two non-trivial solutions is demonstrated, which\nprovide a satisfactory value for the electromagnetic fine structure constant\n$\\alpha$ at scale $M_Z$: $\\alpha(M_Z) = 0.007756$. There is a solution with the\nhigh effective cut-off being close to the Planck mass by the order of\nmagnitude. The most interesting solution corresponds to effective cut-off\n$\\simeq 10^2\\,TeV$. This solution gives quite definite prediction for\nnon-perturbative effects in processes $p+p\\to\\bar t t (W^\\pm, Z)$, which could\nbe observed at the upgraded LHC.\n", "  We study fixed assemblies of touching spheres that can individually rotate.\nFrom any initial state, sliding friction drives an assembly toward a slip-free\nrotation state. For bipartite assemblies, which have only even loops, this\nstate has at least four degrees of freedom. For exactly four degrees of\nfreedom, we analytically predict the final state, which we prove to be\nindependent of the strength of sliding friction, from an arbitrary initial one.\nWith a tabletop experiment, we show how to impose any slip-free rotation state\nby only controlling two spheres, regardless of the total number.\n", "  We establish sharp (or `refined') comparison theorems for the Klein--Gordon\nequation. We show that the condition $V_a\\le V_b$, which leads to $E_a\\le E_b$,\ncan be replaced by the weaker assumption $U_a\\le U_b$ which still implies the\nspectral ordering $E_a\\le E_b$. In the simplest case, for $d=1$,\n$U_i(x)=\\int_0^x V_i(t)dt$, $i=a$ or $b$, and for $d>1$, $U_i(r)=\\int_0^r\nV_i(t) t^{d-1}dt$, $i=a$ or $b$. We also consider sharp comparison theorems in\nthe presence of a scalar potential $S$ (a `variable mass') in addition to the\nvector term $V$ (the time component of a $4$-vector). The theorems are\nillustrated by a variety of explicit detailed examples.\n", "  As a consequence of the Schwartz kernel Theorem, any linear continuous\noperator $\\widehat{A}:$\n$\\mathcal{S}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{S}^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$\ncan be written in Weyl form in a unique way, namely it is the Weyl quantization\nof a unique symbol $a\\in\\mathcal{S}^{\\prime}(\\mathbb{R}^{2n})$. Hence,\ndequantization can always be performed, and in a unique way. Despite the\nimportance of this topic in Quantum Mechanics and Time-frequency Analysis, the\nsame issue for the Born-Jordan quantization seems simply unexplored, except for\nthe case of polynomial symbols, which we also review in detail. In this paper\nwe show that any operator $\\widehat{A}$ as above can be written in Born-Jordan\nform, although the representation is never unique if one allows general\ntemperate distributions as symbols. Then we consider the same problem when the\nspace of temperate distributions is replaced by the space of smooth slowly\nincreasing functions which extend to entire function in $\\mathbb{C}^{2n}$, with\na growth at most exponential in the imaginary directions. We prove again the\nvalidity of such a representation, and we determine a sharp threshold for the\nexponential growth under which the representation is unique. We employ\ntechniques from the theory of division of distributions.\n", "  In the information science literature, recent studies have used patent\ndatabases and patent classification information to construct network maps of\npatent technology classes. In such a patent technology map, almost all pairs of\ntechnology classes are connected, whereas most of the connections between them\nare extremely weak. This observation suggests the possibility of filtering the\npatent network map by removing weak links. However, removing links may reduce\nthe explanatory power of the network on inventor or organization\ndiversification. The network links may explain the patent portfolio\ndiversification paths of inventors and inventing organizations. We measure the\ndiversification explanatory power of the patent network map, and present a\nmethod to objectively choose an optimal trade-off between explanatory power and\nremoving weak links. We show that this method can remove a degree of\narbitrariness compared with previous filtering methods based on arbitrary\nthresholds, and also identify previous filtering methods that created filters\noutside the optimal trade-off. The filtered map aims to aid in network\nvisualization analyses of the technological diversification of inventors,\norganizations and other innovation agents, and potential foresight analysis.\nSuch applications to a prolific inventor (Leonard Forbes) and company (Google)\nare demonstrated.\n", "  We show that tunneling involving bosonic wires and/or boson integer quantum\nHall (bIQH) edges is characterized by universal features which are absent in\ntheir fermionic counterparts. Considering a pair of minimal geometries, we find\na low energy enhancement and a universal high versus zero energy relation for\nthe tunnel conductance that holds for all wire/bIQH edge combinations. Features\ndistinguishing bIQH edges include a current imbalance to chemical potential\nbias ratio that is quantized despite the lack of conductance quantization in\nthe bIQH edges themselves. The predicted phenomena require only initial states\nto be thermal and thus are well suited for tests with ultracold bosons forming\nwires and bIQH states. For the latter, we highlight a potential realization\nbased on single component bosons in the recently observed Harper-Hofstadter\nbandstructure.\n", "  The Rashba-Edelstein effect stems from the interaction between the electron's\nspin and its momentum induced by spin-orbit interaction at an interface or a\nsurface. It was shown that the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect can be used to\nconvert a spin- into a charge current. Here, we demonstrate that a Bi/Ag Rashba\ninterface can even drive an adjacent ferromagnet to resonance. We employ a\nspin-torque ferromagnetic resonance excitation/detection scheme which was\ndeveloped originally for a bulk spin-orbital effect, the spin Hall effect. In\nour experiment, the direct Rashba-Edelstein effect generates an oscillating\nspin current from an alternating charge current driving the magnetization\nprecession in a neighboring permalloy (Py, Ni80Fe20) layer. Electrical\ndetection of the magnetization dynamics is achieved by a rectification\nmechanism of the time dependent multilayer resistance arising from the\nanisotropic magnetoresistance.\n", "  The temperature dependence of DNA flexibility is studied in the presence of\nstretching and unzipping forces. Two classes of models are considered. In one\ncase the origin of elasticity is entropic due to the polymeric correlations,\nand in the other the double-stranded DNA is taken to have an intrinsic rigidity\nfor bending. In both cases single strands are completely flexible. The change\nin the elastic constant for the flexible case due to thermally generated\nbubbles is obtained exactly. For the case of intrinsic rigidity, the elastic\nconstant is found to be proportional to the square root of the bubble number\nfluctuation.\n", "  We introduce a new approach to analyzing the interaction between classical\nand quantum systems that is based on a limiting procedure applied to\nmulti-particle Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations. The limit equations obtained by this\nprocedure, which we refer to as the classical-quantum limit, govern the\ninteraction between classical and quantum systems, and they possess many\ndesirable properties that are inherited in the limit from the multi-particle\nquantum system. As an application, we use the classical-quantum limit equations\nto identify the source of the non-local signalling that is known to occur in\nthe classical-quantum hybrid scheme of Hall and Reginatto. We also derive the\nfirst order correction to the classical-quantum limit equation to obtain a\nfully consistent first order approximation to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation that\nshould be accurate for modeling the interaction between particles of disparate\nmass in the regime where the particles with the larger masses are effectively\nclassical.\n", "  A sideband cooling strategy that incorporates (i) the dynamics induced by\nstructured (non-Markovian) environments in the target and auxiliary systems and\n(ii) the optimally-time-modulated interaction between them is developed. For\nthe context of cavity optomechanics, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered\nin the target system, ground state cooling is reached at much faster rates and\nat much lower phonon occupation number than previously reported. In constrast\nto similar current strategies, ground state cooling is reached here for\ncoupling-strength rates that are experimentally accesible for the\nstate-of-the-art implementations. After the ultrafast\noptimal-ground-state-cooling protocol is accomplished, an additional optimal\ncontrol strategy is considered to maintain the phonon number as closer as\npossible to the one obtained in the cooling procedure. Contrary to the\nconventional expectation, when non-Markovian dynamics are considered in the\nauxiliary system, the efficiency of the cooling protocol is undermined.\n", "  Asteroid families are groups of minor planets which have a common origin in\ncatastrophic disruptions. Young asteroid families are very interesting because\nthey represent the product of their parent body's fragmentation before orbital\nand physical evolutionary processes could have changed them. A group of minor\nasteroids associated with the largest body Datura(1270) is of particular\ninterest because it has enough known members and resides in the inner part of\nthe main asteroid belt and is easy to observe. Up to now, 7 members of this\nfamily are known. Here we discuss three new members of the Datura Family:\n338309(2002 VR17), 2002 RH291 and 2014 OE206. To prove that these\nrecently-discovered members belong to the Datura family, we conducted numeric\nintegration with all gravitational perturbation over the last 800 kyrs. In the\nresults, we have found that 338309(2002 VR17) and 2002 RH291 are very close to\nthe mean orbit of this family throughout the calculation. In the case of 2014\nOE206, it has a strongly chaotic orbit. The possible explanation of this is in\nthe resonance character of its orbit.\n", "  Given a topological modular functor $\\mathcal{V}$ in the sense of Walker\n\\cite{Walker}, we construct vector bundles over $\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$,\nwhose Chern classes define semi-simple cohomological field theories. This\nconstruction depends on a determination of the logarithm of the eigenvalues of\nthe Dehn twist and central element actions. We show that the intersection of\nthe Chern class with the $\\psi$-classes in $\\bar{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ is\ncomputed by the topological recursion of \\cite{EOFg}, for a local spectral\ncurve that we describe. In particular, we show how the Verlinde formula for the\ndimensions $D_{\\vec{\\lambda}}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{g,n}) = \\dim\n\\mathcal{V}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{g,n})$ is retrieved from the\ntopological recursion. We analyze the consequences of our result on two\nexamples: modular functors associated to a finite group $G$ (for which\n$D_{\\vec{\\lambda}}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{g,n})$ enumerates certain $G$-principle\nbundles over a genus $g$ surface with $n$ boundary conditions specified by\n$\\vec{\\lambda}$), and the modular functor obtained from Wess-Zumino-Witten\nconformal field theory associated to a simple, simply-connected Lie group $G$\n(for which $\\mathcal{V}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{g,n})$ is the Verlinde\nbundle).\n", "  The structure of overlapping subdivergences, which appear in the perturbative\nexpansions of quantum field theory, is analyzed using algebraic lattice theory.\nIt is shown that for specific QFTs the sets of subdivergences of Feynman\ndiagrams form algebraic lattices. This class of QFTs includes the Standard\nmodel. In kinematic renormalization schemes, in which tadpole diagrams vanish,\nthese lattices are semimodular. This implies that the Hopf algebra of Feynman\ndiagrams is graded by the coradical degree or equivalently that every maximal\nforest has the same length in the scope of BPHZ renormalization. As an\napplication of this framework a formula for the counter terms in\nzero-dimensional QFT is given together with some examples of the enumeration of\nprimitive or skeleton diagrams.\n", "  We introduce a generalized $d$-dimensional Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model in\npresence of long-range interactions, and perform a first-principle study of its\nchaos for $d=1,2,3$ through large-scale numerical simulations. The nonlinear\ninteraction is assumed to decay algebraically as $d_{ij}^{-\\alpha}$ ($\\alpha\n\\ge 0$), $\\{d_{ij}\\}$ being the distances between $N$ oscillator sites.\nStarting from random initial conditions we compute the maximal Lyapunov\nexponent $\\lambda_{max}$ as a function of $N$. Our $N>>1$ results strongly\nindicate that $\\lambda_{max}$ remains constant and positive for $\\alpha/d>1$\n(implying strong chaos, mixing and ergodicity), and that it vanishes like\n$N^{-\\kappa}$ for $0 \\le \\alpha/d < 1$ (thus approaching weak chaos and opening\nthe possibility of breakdown of ergodicity). The suitably rescaled exponent\n$\\kappa$ exhibits universal scaling, namely that $(d+2) \\kappa$ depends only on\n$\\alpha/d$ and, when $\\alpha/d$ increases from zero to unity, it monotonically\ndecreases from unity to zero, remaining so for all $\\alpha/d >1$. The value\n$\\alpha/d=1$ can therefore be seen as a critical point separating the ergodic\nregime from the anomalous one, $\\kappa$ playing a role analogous to that of an\norder parameter. This scaling law is consistent with Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics\nfor $\\alpha/d > 1$, and possibly with $q$-statistics for $0 \\le \\alpha/d < 1$.\n", "  We present new exact expressions for a class of moments for the geometric\nBrownian motion, in terms of determinants, obtained using a recurrence relation\nand combinatorial arguments for the case of a Ito's Wiener process. We then\napply the obtained exact formulas to computing averages of the solution of the\nlogistic stochastic differential equation via a series expansion, and compare\nthe results to the solution obtained via Monte Carlo.\n", "  We determine the charge radius of the proton by analyzing the published low\nmomentum transfer electron-proton scattering data from Mainz. We note that\npolynomial expansions of the form factor converge for momentum transfers\nsquared below $4m_\\pi^2$, where $m_\\pi$ is the pion mass. Expansions with\nenough terms to fit the data, but few enough not to overfit, yield proton radii\nsmaller than the CODATA or Mainz values and in accord with the muonic atom\nresults. We also comment on analyses using a wider range of data, and overall\nobtain a proton radius $R_E=0.840(16$) fm.\n", "  This paper deals with existence of strange stars in $f\\left(T\\right) $\nmodified gravity. For this purpose, we have taken the diagonal tetrad field of\nstatic spacetime with charged anisotropic fluid and MIT bag model, which\nprovide the linear relation between radial pressure and density of the matter.\nFurther, the analysis of the resulting equations have been done by assuming the\nparametric form of the metric functions in term of the radial profiles with\nsome unknown constant (introduced by Krori and Barua). By the matching of two\nmetrices, unknown constant of the metric functions appear in terms of mass,\nradius and charge of the stars, the observed values of these quantities have\nbeen used for the detail analysis of the the derived model. We have discuss the\nregularity, anisotropy, energy conditions, stability and surface redshift of\nthe model.\n", "  Deep connections are known to exist between scale-free networks and\nnon-Gibbsian statistics. For example, typical degree distributions at the\nthermodynamical limit are of the form $P(k) \\propto e_q^{-k/\\kappa}$, where the\n$q$-exponential form $e_q^z \\equiv [1+(1-q)z]^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}$ optimizes the\nnonadditive entropy $S_q$ (which, for $q\\to 1$, recovers the Boltzmann-Gibbs\nentropy). We introduce and study here $d$-dimensional geographically-located\nnetworks which grow with preferential attachment involving Euclidean distances\nthrough $r_{ij}^{-\\alpha_A} \\; (\\alpha_A \\ge 0)$. Revealing the connection with\n$q$-statistics, we numerically verify (for $d$ =1, 2, 3 and 4) that the\n$q$-exponential degree distributions exhibit, for both $q$ and $\\kappa$,\nuniversal dependences on the ratio $\\alpha_A/d$. Moreover, the $q=1$ limit is\nrapidly achieved by increasing $\\alpha_A/d$ to infinity.\n", "  We describe a minimal extension of the standard model by three right-handed\nneutrinos, a scalar doublet, and a scalar singlet (the \"$\\nu$DFSZ\") which\nserves as an existence proof that weakly coupled high-scale physics can\nnaturally explain phenomenological shortcomings of the SM. The $\\nu$DFSZ can\nexplain neutrino masses, baryogenesis, the strong CP problem, and dark matter,\nand remains calculably natural despite a hierarchy of scales up to $\\sim\n10^{11}$ GeV. It predicts a SM-like Higgs boson, (maximally) TeV-scale scalar\nstates, intermediate-scale hierarchical leptogenesis ($10^5\\text{ GeV}\\lesssim\nM_{N}\\lesssim 10^7\\text{ GeV}$), and axionic dark matter.\n", "  Persistent evidence for a cosmic hemispherical asymmetry in the temperature\nfield of cosmic microwave background (CMB) as observed by both WMAP as well as\nPLANCK increases the possibility of its cosmological origin. Presence of this\nsignal may lead to different values for the standard model cosmological\nparameters in different directions, and that can have significant implications\nfor other studies where they are used. We investigate the effect of this cosmic\nhemispherical asymmetry on cosmological parameters using non-isotropic Gaussian\nrandom simulations injected with both scale dependent and scale independent\nmodulation strengths. Our analysis shows that $A_s$ and $n_s$ are the most\nsusceptible parameters to acquire position dependence across the sky for the\nkind of isotropy breaking phenomena under study. As expected, we find maximum\nvariation arises for the case of scale independent modulation of CMB\nanisotropies. We find that scale dependent modulation profile as seen in PLANCK\ndata could lead to only $1.25\\sigma$ deviation in $A_s$ in comparison to its\nestimate from isotropic CMB sky.\n", "  We discover two additional Lax pairs and three nonlocal recursion operators\nfor symmetries of the general heavenly equation introduced by Doubrov and\nFerapontov. Converting the equation to a two-component form, we obtain\nLagrangian and Hamiltonian structures of the two-component general heavenly\nsystem. We study all point symmetries of the two-component system and, using\nthe inverse Noether theorem in the Hamiltonian form, obtain all the integrals\nof motion corresponding to each variational (Noether) symmetry. We discover\nthat in the two-component form we have only a single nonlocal recursion\noperator. Composing the recursion operator with the first Hamiltonian operator\nwe obtain second Hamiltonian operator. We check the Jacobi identities for the\nsecond Hamiltonian operator and compatibility of the two Hamiltonian structures\nusing P. Olver's theory of functional multi-vectors. Our well-founded\nconjecture is that P. Olver's method works fine for nonlocal operators. We show\nthat the general heavenly equation in the two-component form is a\nbi-Hamiltonian system integrable in the sense of Magri. We demonstrate how to\nobtain nonlocal Hamiltonian flows generated by local Hamiltonians by using\nformal adjoint recursion operator.\n", "  In this paper we construct new solutions of the Kahler-Yang-Mills equations,\nby applying dimensional reduction methods to the product of the complex\nprojective line with a compact Riemann surface. The resulting equations, that\nwe call gravitating vortex equations, describe Abelian vortices on the Riemann\nsurface with back reaction of the metric. As a particular case of these\ngravitating vortices on the Riemann sphere we find solutions of the\nEinstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, which physically correspond to Nielsen-Olesen\ncosmic strings in the Bogomol'nyi phase. We use this to provide a Geometric\nInvariant Theory interpretation of an existence result by Y. Yang for the\nEinstein-Bogomol'nyi equations, applying a criterion due to G. Szekelyhidi.\n", "  A key problem in the study and design of complex systems is the apparent\ndisconnection between the microscopic and the macroscopic. It is not\nstraightforward to identify the local interactions that give rise to an\nobserved global phenomenon, nor is it simple to design a system that will\nexhibit some desired global property using only local knowledge. Here we\npropose a methodology that allows for the identification of local interactions\nthat give rise to a desired global property of a network, the degree\ndistribution. Given a set of observable processes acting on a network, we\ndetermine the conditions that must satisfied to generate a desired steady-state\ndegree distribution. We thereby provide a simple example for a class of tasks\nwhere a system can be designed to self-organize to a given state.\n", "  We consider the Dirichlet realization of the operator $-h^2\\Delta+iV$ in the\nsemi-classical limit $h\\to0$, where $V$ is a smooth real potential with no\ncritical points. For a one dimensional setting, we obtain the complete\nasymptotic expansion, in powers of $h$, of each eigenvalue. In two dimensions\nwe obtain the left margin of the spectrum, under some additional conditions.\n", "  The strong interaction of individual quantum emitters with resonant cavities\nis of fundamental interest for understanding light matter interactions.\nPlasmonic cavities hold the promise of attaining the strong coupling regime\neven under ambient conditions and within subdiffraction volumes. Recent\nexperiments revealed strong coupling between individual plasmonic structures\nand multiple organic molecules, but so far strong coupling at the limit of a\nsingle quantum emitter has not been reported. Here we demonstrate vacuum Rabi\nsplitting, a manifestation of strong coupling, using silver bowtie plasmonic\ncavities loaded with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). A transparency dip is\nobserved in the scattering spectra of individual bowties with one to a few QDs,\ndirectly observed in their gaps. A coupling rate as high as 120 meV is\nregistered even with a single QD, placing the bowtie-QD constructs close to the\nstrong coupling regime. These observations are verified by\npolarization-dependent experiments and validated by electromagnetic\ncalculations.\n", "  While the use of numerical general relativity for modeling astrophysical\nphenomena and compact objects is commonplace, the application to cosmological\nscenarios is only just beginning. Here, we examine the expansion of a spacetime\nusing the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formalism of numerical\nrelativity in synchronous gauge. This work represents the first numerical\ncosmological study that is fully relativistic, non-linear and without symmetry.\nThe universe that emerges exhibits an average\nFriedmann-Lema\\\"itre-Robertston-Walker (FLRW) behavior, however this universe\nalso exhibits locally inhomogeneous expansion beyond that expected in linear\nperturbation theory around a FLRW background.\n", "  We present cosmological-scale numerical simulations of an evolving universe\nin full general relativity (GR) and introduce a new numerical tool, {\\sc\nCosmoGRaPH}, which employs the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN)\nformalism on a 3-dimensional grid. Using {\\sc CosmoGRaPH}, we calculate the\neffect of an inhomogeneous matter distribution on the evolution of a spacetime.\nWe also present the results of a set of standard stability tests to demonstrate\nthe robustness of our simulations.\n", "  We investigate signatures that would be produced in the spectrum and sky\ndistribution of UHECR by a population of the Galactic sources of high-energy\nprotons in the energy range around 1~EeV, i.e., around the\ndiffusive-to-ballistic transition. In this regime, the CR flux has to be\ncalculated numerically. We employ the approach that consists in backtracking\nanti-protons from Earth through the Galaxy and integrating the source\nemissivity along the trajectory. This approach makes evident two generic\nfeatures of the transition region: sharp increase of the total flux as the\nenergy decreases across the transition region, and its strong anisotropy\n(appearance of a bright compact spot) all the way until the onset of the\ndiffusive regime. We then discuss and compare several methods to experimentally\ndetect or constrain these features. We find that a few percent admixture of the\nGalactic protons can in principle be detected by the current UHECR experiments.\n", "  In this work, we calculate meson-baryon scattering phase shifts in four\nchannels using lattice QCD methods. From a set of calculations at four volumes,\ncorresponding to spatial sizes of 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 fm, and a pion mass of m_pi\n~ 390 MeV, we determine the scattering lengths and effective ranges for these\nsystems at the corresponding quark masses. We also perform the calculation at a\nlighter quark mass, m_pi ~ 230 MeV, on the largest volume. Using these\ndeterminations, along with those in previous work, we perform a chiral\nextrapolation of the scattering lengths to the physical point after correcting\nfor the effective range contributions using the multi-volume calculations\nperformed at m_pi ~ 390 MeV.\n", "  A general representation formula for the scattering matrix of a scattering\nsystem consisting of two self-adjoint operators in terms of an abstract\noperator valued Titchmarsh-Weyl $m$-function is proved. This result is applied\nto scattering problems for different self-adjoint realizations of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators on unbounded domains, Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators with\nsingular potentials supported on hypersurfaces, and orthogonal couplings of\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators. In these applications the scattering matrix is\nexpressed in an explicit form with the help of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.\n", "  Experimental challenges in identifying various types of magnetic ordering in\ngraphene quantum dots (QDs) pose a major hurdle in the application of these\nnanostructures for spintronic devices. }Based upon phase diagrams obtained by\nemploying {\\normalsize{}the $\\pi$-electron }Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model\nHamiltonian, we demonstrate that the magnetic states undergo phase transition\nunder the influence of an external electric field. Our calculations of the\nelectro-absorption spectra of these QDs indicate that the spectrum in question\ncarries strong signatures of their magnetic state (FM vs AFM), thus suggesting\nthe possibility of an all-optical characterization of their magnetic nature.\nFurther, the gaps for the up and the down spins are the same in the absence of\nan external electric field, both for the antiferromagnetic (AFM), and the\nferromagnetic (FM) states of QDs. But, once the QDs are exposed to a suitably\ndirected external electric field, gaps for different spins split, and, exhibit\ndistinct variations with respect to the strength of the field. The nature of\nvariation exhibited by the energy gaps corresponding to the up and down spins\nis different for the AFM and FM configurations of QDs. This selective\nmanipulation of the spin-polarized gap splitting by an electric field in finite\ngraphene nanostructures can open up new frontiers in the design of\ngraphene-based spintronic devices.\n", "  If the primordial bispectrum is sufficiently large then the CMB hemispherical\nasymmetry may be explained by a large-scale mode of exceptional amplitude which\nperturbs the zeta two-point function. We extend previous calculations, which\nwere restricted to one- or two-source scenarios, by providing a method to\ncompute the response of the two-point function in any model yielding a\n'local-like' bispectrum. In general, this shows that it is not the reduced\nbispectrum fNL which sources the amplitude and scale-dependence of the mode\ncoupling but rather a combination of 'response functions'. We discuss why it is\ndifficult to construct successful scenarios and enumerate the fine-tunings\nwhich seem to be required. Finally, we exhibit a concrete model which can be\ncontrived to match the observational constraints and show that to a Planck-like\nexperiment it would appear to have |fNL-local| ~ |fNL-equi| ~ |fNL-ortho| ~ 1.\nTherefore, contrary to previous analyses, we conclude that it is possible to\ngenerate the asymmetry while respecting observational constraints on the\nbispectrum and low-ell multipoles even without tuning our location on the\nlong-wavelength mode.\n", "  Over the last decade tensor network states (TNS) have emerged as a powerful\ntool for the study of quantum many body systems. The matrix product states\n(MPS) are one particular class of TNS and are used for the simulation of\n(1+1)-dimensional systems. In this proceeding we use MPS to determine the\nelementary excitations of the Schwinger model in the presence of an electric\nbackground field. We obtain an estimate for the value of the background field\nwhere the one-particle excitation with the largest energy becomes unstable and\ndecays into two other elementary particles with smaller energy.\n", "  It is demonstrated theoretically that a thin layer of an anisotropic\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator can effectively conduct spin current by\nexcitation of a pair of evanescent AFM spin wave modes. The spin current\nflowing through the AFM is not conserved due to the interaction between the\nexcited AFM modes and the AFM lattice, and, depending on the excitation\nconditions, can be either attenuated or enhanced. When the phase difference\nbetween the excited evanescent modes is close to $\\pi/2$, there is an optimum\nAFM thickness for which the output spin current reaches a maximum, that can\nsignificantly exceed the magnitude of the input spin current. The spin current\ntransfer through the AFM depends on the ambient temperature and increases\nsubstantially when temperature approaches the Neel temperature of the AFM\nlayer.\n", "  We continue our investigation of large field inflation models obtained from\nhigher-dimensional gauge theories, initiated in our previous study\narXiv:1407.1951. We focus on Dante's Inferno model which was the most preferred\nmodel in our previous analysis. We point out the relevance of the IR\nobstruction to UV completion, which constrains the form of the potential of the\nmassive vector field, under the current observational upper bound on the tensor\nto scalar ratio. We also show that in simple examples of the potential arising\nfrom DBI action of a D5-brane and that of an NS5-brane that the inflation takes\nplace in the field range which is within the convergence radius of the Taylor\nexpansion. This is in contrast to the well known examples of axion monodromy\ninflation where inflaton takes place outside the convergence radius of the\nTaylor expansion. This difference arises from the very essence of Dante's\nInferno model that the effective inflaton potential is stretched in the\ninflaton field direction compared with the potential for the original field.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the application of non-local graph entropy to\nevolving and dynamical graphs. The measure is based upon the notion of Markov\ndiffusion on a graph, and relies on the entropy applied to trajectories\noriginating at a specific node. In particular, we study the model of\nreinforcement-decay graph dynamics, which leads to scale free graphs. We find\nthat the node entropy characterizes the structure of the network in the two\nparameter phase-space describing the dynamical evolution of the weighted graph.\nWe then apply an adapted version of the entropy measure to purely memristive\ncircuits. We provide evidence that meanwhile in the case of DC voltage the\nentropy based on the forward probability is enough to characterize the graph\nproperties, in the case of AC voltage generators one needs to consider both\nforward and backward based transition probabilities. We provide also evidence\nthat the entropy highlights the self-organizing properties of memristive\ncircuits, which re-organizes itself to satisfy the symmetries of the underlying\ngraph.\n", "  We study systematically the conformal geometry of higher spin bosonic gauge\nfields in three spacetime dimensions. We recall the definition of the Cotton\ntensor for higher spins and establish a number of its properties that turn out\nto be key in solving in terms of prepotentials the constraint equations of the\nHamiltonian (3 + 1) formulation of four-dimensional higher spin gauge fields.\nThe prepotentials are shown to exhibit higher spin conformal symmetry. Just as\nfor spins 1 and 2, they provide a remarkably simple, manifestly duality\ninvariant formulation of the theory. While the higher spin conformal geometry\nis developed for arbitrary bosonic spin, we explicitly perform the Hamiltonian\nanalysis and derive the solution of the constraints only in the illustrative\ncase of spin 3. In a separate publication, the Hamiltonian analysis in terms of\nprepotentials is extended to all bosonic higher spins using the conformal tools\nof this paper, and the same emergence of higher spin conformal symmetry is\nconfirmed.\n", "  A unifying principle explaining the numerical bounds of quantum correlations\nremains elusive despite the efforts devoted to identifying it. Here we show\nthat these bounds are indeed not exclusive to quantum theory: for any abstract\ncorrelation scenario with compatible measurements, models based on classical\nwaves produce probability distributions indistinguishable from those of quantum\ntheory and, therefore, share the same bounds. We demonstrate this finding by\nimplementing classical microwaves that propagate along meter-size\ntransmission-line circuits and reproduce the probabilities of three emblematic\nquantum experiments. Our results show that the \"quantum\" bounds would also\noccur in a classical universe without quanta. The implications of this\nobservation are discussed.\n", "  One of the most sought-after goals in experimental quantum communication is\nthe implementation of a quantum repeater. The performance of quantum repeaters\ncan be assessed by comparing the attained rate with the quantum and private\ncapacity of direct transmission, assisted by unlimited classical two-way\ncommunication. However, these quantities are hard to compute, motivating the\nsearch for upper bounds. Takeoka, Guha and Wilde found the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel to be an upper bound on both these\ncapacities. In general it is still hard to find the exact value of the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel, but clever sub-optimal squashing channels\nallow one to upper bound this quantity, and thus also the corresponding\ncapacities. Here, we exploit this idea to obtain bounds for any\nphase-insensitive Gaussian bosonic channel. This bound allows one to benchmark\nthe implementation of quantum repeaters for a large class of channels used to\nmodel communication across fibers. In particular, our bound is applicable to\nthe realistic scenario when there is a restriction on the mean photon number on\nthe input. Furthermore, we show that the squashed entanglement of a channel is\nconvex in the set of channels, and we use a connection between the squashed\nentanglement of a quantum channel and its entanglement assisted classical\ncapacity. Building on this connection, we obtain the exact squashed\nentanglement and two-way assisted capacities of the $d$-dimensional erasure\nchannel and bounds on the amplitude-damping channel and all qubit Pauli\nchannels. In particular, our bound improves on the previous best known squashed\nentanglement upper bound of the depolarizing channel.\n", "  We study the rotor-router walk on the infinite square lattice with the\noutgoing edges at each lattice site ordered clockwise. In the previous paper\n[J.Phys.A: Math. Theor. 48, 285203 (2015)], we have considered the loops\ncreated by rotors and labeled sites where the loops become closed. The sequence\nof labels in the rotor-router walk was conjectured to form a spiral structure\nobeying asymptotically an Archimedean property. In the present paper, we select\na subset of labels called \"nodes\" and consider spirals formed by nodes. The new\nspirals are directly related to tree-like structures which represent the\nevolution of the cluster of vertices visited by the walk. We show that the\naverage number of visits to the origin $\\left<n_0(t)\\right>$ by the moment\n$t\\gg 1$ is $\\left<n_0(t)\\right> = 4 \\left<n(t)\\right> + O(1)$ where\n$\\left<n(t)\\right>$ is the average number of rotations of the spiral.\n", "  The purpose of this study is to show that monopoles induce the chiral\nsymmetry breaking. In order to indicate the evidence, we add one pair of\nmonopoles with magnetic charges to the quenched SU(3) configurations by a\nmonopole creation operator, and investigate the propaties of the chiral\nsymmetry breaking using the Overlap fermion. We show that instantons are\ncreated by the monopoles. The pseudoscalar meson mass and decay constant are\ncomputed from the correlation functions, and the renormalization constant\n$Z_{S}$ is determined by the non perturbative method. The renormalization group\ninvariant chiral condensate in $\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}$-scheme at 2 [GeV] is\nevaluated by the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner formula, and the random matrix theory.\nFinally, we estimate the renormalization group invariant quark masses $\\bar{m}\n= (m_{u} + m_{d})/2$, and $m_{s}$ in $\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}$-scheme at 2 [GeV].\nThe preliminary results indicate that the chiral condensate decreases and the\nquark masses become slightly heavy by increasing the number of monopole\ncharges.\n", "  We present a general review of the bifurcation sequences of periodic orbits\nin general position of a family of resonant Hamiltonian normal forms with\nnearly equal unperturbed frequencies, invariant under $Z_2 \\times Z_2$\nsymmetry. The rich structure of these classical systems is investigated with\ngeometric methods and the relation with the singularity theory approach is also\nhighlighted. The geometric approach is the most straightforward way to obtain a\ngeneral picture of the phase-space dynamics of the family as is defined by a\ncomplete subset in the space of control parameters complying with the symmetry\nconstraint. It is shown how to find an energy-momentum map describing the phase\nspace structure of each member of the family, a catastrophe map that captures\nits global features and formal expressions for action-angle variables. Several\nexamples, mainly taken from astrodynamics, are used as applications.\n", "  We study the static electric current due to the Chiral Magnetic Effect in\nsamples of Weyl semimetals with slab geometry, where the magnetic field is\nparallel to the boundaries of the slab. We use the Wilson-Dirac Hamiltonian as\na simplest model of parity-breaking Weyl semimetal with two-band structure. We\nfind that the CME current is strongly localized at the open boundaries of the\nslab, where the current density in the direction of the magnetic field\napproaches the conventional value $j = \\mu_5 B /2 \\pi^2$ at sufficiently small\nvalues of the chiral chemical potential $\\mu_5$ and magnetic field $B$. On the\nother hand, very large values of magnetic field tend to suppress the CME\nresponse. We observe that the localization width of the current is independent\nof the slab width and is given by the magnetic length $l_B = 1/\\sqrt{B}$ when\n$\\mu_5 \\ll \\sqrt{B}$. In the opposite regime when $\\mu_5 \\gg \\sqrt{B}$ the\nlocalization width is determined solely by $\\mu_5$\n", "  We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the magnetic and structural\nproperties of the shape-memory Heusler alloy Ni50Mn35In15. Magnetization and\nx-ray diffraction experiments were performed at hydrostatic pressures up to 5\nGPa using diamond anvil cells. Pressure stabilizes the martensitic phase,\nshifting the martensitic transition to higher temperatures and suppresses the\nferromagnetic austenitic phase. Above ~3 GPa, where the martensitic-transition\ntemperature approaches the Curie temperature in the austenite, the\nmagnetization shows no indication of ferromagnetic ordering anymore. We further\nfind an extremely large temperatureregion with a mixture of martensite and\naustenite phases, which directly relates to the magnetic properties.\n", "  This paper constitutes the investigations regarding possible formation of\ncompact stars in $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity, where $R$ is Ricci scalar and $T$\nis trace of energy momentum tensor. In this connection, we use analytic\nsolution of Krori and Barua metric (Krori and Barua 1975)to spherically\nsymmetric anisotropic star in context of $f(R,T)$ gravity. The masses and radii\nof compact stars models namely model $1$, model$ 2$ and model $3$ are employed\nto incorporate with unknown constants in Krori and Barua metric. The physical\nfeatures such as regularity at center, anisotropy measure, casuality and\nwell-behaved condition of above mentioned class of compact starts are analyzed.\nMoreover, we have also discussed energy conditions, stability and surface\nredshift in $f(R,T)$ gravity.\n", "  This paper describes the effects of a complex scalar scaling field on quantum\nmechanics. The field origin is an extension of the gauge freedom for basis\nchoice in gauge theories to the underlying scalar field. The extension is based\non the idea that the value of a number at one space time point does not\ndetermine the value at another point. This, combined with the description of\nmathematical systems as structures of different types, results in the presence\nof separate number fields and vector spaces, both as structures, at different\nspace time locations. Complex number structures and vector spaces at each\nlocation, are scaled by a complex space time dependent scaling factor. The\neffect of this scaling factor on several physical and geometric quantities has\nbeen described in other work. Here the emphasis is on quantum mechanics of one\nand two particles, their states and properties. Multiparticle states are also\nbriefly described. The effect shows as a complex, nonunitary, scalar field\nconnection on a fiber bundle description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.\nThe lack of physical evidence for the presence of this field so far means that\nthe coupling constant of this field to fermions is very small. It also means\nthat the gradient of the field must be very small in a local region of\ncosmological space and time. Outside this region there are no restrictions on\nthe field gradient.\n", "  It is possible to delay the hierarchy problem, by replacing the standard\nHiggs-sector by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, and at the same time ensure\nperturbative naturalness through the so-called Veltman conditions. As we showed\nin a previous study, minimal models of this type require the introduction of an\nextra singlet scalar further coupled to new fermions. In this constrained setup\nthe Higgs mass was close to the observed value and the new scalar mass was\nbelow a TeV scale. Here we first extend the previous analysis by taking into\naccount the important difference between running mass and pole mass of the\nscalar states. We then investigate whether these theories can account for the\n750 GeV excess in diphotons observed by the LHC collaborations. New QCD-colored\nfermions in the TeV mass range coupled to the new scalar state are needed to\ndescribe the excess. We further show, by explicit computation of the running of\nthe couplings, that the model is under perturbative control till just above the\nmasses of the heaviest states of the theory. We further suggest related\ntestable signatures and thereby show that the LHC experiments can test these\nmodels.\n", "  To every hyperelliptic curve one can assign the periods of the integrals over\nthe holomorphic and the meromorphic differentials. By comparing two\nrepresentations of the so-called projective connection it is possible to\nreexpress the latter periods by the first. This leads to expressions including\nonly the curve's parameters $\\lambda_j$ and modular forms. By a change of basis\nof the meromorphic differentials one can further simplify this expression. We\ndiscuss the advantages of these explicitly given bases, which we call Baker and\nKlein basis, respectively.\n", "  Causal modelling provides a powerful set of tools for identifying causal\nstructure from observed correlations. It is well known that such techniques\nfail for quantum systems, unless one introduces `spooky' hidden mechanisms.\nWhether one can produce a genuinely quantum framework in order to discover\ncausal structure remains an open question. Here we introduce a new framework\nfor quantum causal modelling that allows for the discovery of causal structure.\nWe define quantum analogues for many of the core features of classical causal\nmodelling techniques, including the Causal Markov Condition and Faithfulness.\nBased on the process matrix formalism, this framework naturally extends to\ngeneralised structures with indefinite causal order.\n", "  The experimental and theoretical implications of heavy digauge boson\nresonances that couple to, or are comprised of, new charged and strongly\ninteracting matter are investigated. Observation and measurement of ratios of\nthe resonant digauge boson channels $WW$, $ZZ$, $\\gamma \\gamma$, $Z \\gamma$,\nand $gg$ in the form of dijets, provide a rather direct -- and for some ratios\na rather robust -- probe of the gauge representations of the new matter. For a\nspin-zero resonance with the quantum numbers of the vacuum, the ratios of\nresonant $WW$ and $ZZ$ to $\\gamma \\gamma$ channels, as well as the longitudinal\nversus transverse polarization fractions in the $WW$ and $ZZ$ channels, provide\nprobes for possible mixing with the Higgs boson, while di-Higgs and ditop\nresonant channels, $hh$ and $tt$, provide somewhat less sensitivity. We present\na survey of possible underlying models for digauge boson resonances by\nconsidering various limits for the mass of the new charged and strongly\ninteracting matter fields as well as the confinement scale of new hypergauge\ninteractions under which they may also be charged. In these limits, resonances\nmay be included as elementary weakly coupled spin-zero states or can correspond\nto hyperglueballs, hyperonia, or pseudoscalar hypermesons. For each of these\ncases, we make predictions for additional states that could be resonantly or\npair produced and observed at the Large Hadron Collider or in future collider\nexperiments. Heavy digauge boson resonances can provide a unified explanation\nfor a number of small discrepancies and excesses in reported data from the\nLarge Hadron Collider.\n", "  An interferometer - no matter how clever the design - cannot reveal both the\nwave and particle behavior of a quantum system. This fundamental idea has been\ncaptured by inequalities, so-called wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs),\nthat upper bound the sum of the fringe visibility (wave behavior) and path\ndistinguishability (particle behavior). Another fundamental idea is\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle, stating that some pairs of observables\ncannot be known simultaneously. Recent work has unified these two principles\nfor two-path interferometers. Here we extend this unification to $n$-path\ninterferometers, showing that WPDRs correspond to a modern formulation of the\nuncertainty principle stated in terms of entropies. Furthermore, our\nunification provides a framework for solving an outstanding problem of how to\nformulate universally valid WPDRs for interferometers with more than two paths,\nand we employ this framework to derive some novel WPDRs.\n", "  Photonic sensors have many applications in a range of physical settings, from\nmeasuring mechanical pressure in manufacturing to detecting protein\nconcentration in biomedical samples. A variety of sensing approaches exist, and\nplasmonic systems in particular have received much attention due to their\nability to confine light below the diffraction limit, greatly enhancing\nsensitivity. Recently, quantum techniques have been identified that can\noutperform classical sensing methods and achieve sensitivity below the\nso-called shot-noise limit. Despite this significant potential, the use of\ndefinite photon number states in lossy plasmonic systems for further improving\nsensing capabilities is not well studied. Here, we investigate the sensing\nperformance of a plasmonic interferometer that simultaneously exploits the\nquantum nature of light and its electromagnetic field confinement. We show\nthat, despite the presence of loss, specialised quantum resources can provide\nimproved sensitivity and resolution beyond the shot-noise limit within a\ncompact plasmonic device operating below the diffraction limit.\n", "  In the framework of the minimal $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model,\nwe investigate the Higgs boson production processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow ZH$,\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow \\nu_{e}\\bar{\\nu_{e}}H$, $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow\nt\\bar{t}H$, $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow ZHH$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow\n\\nu_{e}\\bar{\\nu_{e}}HH$ at the International Linear Collider (ILC). We present\nthe production cross sections, the relative corrections and compare our results\nwith the expected experimental accuracies for Higgs decay channel $H\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b}$. In the allowed parameter space, we find that the effects of the\nthree single Higgs boson production processes might approach the observable\nthreshold of the ILC, and that the Higgs signal strengths $\\mu_{b\\bar{b}}$ of\nthe two double Higgs boson production processes are all out of the observable\nthreshold of the ILC so that the effects will be difficult to be observed at\nthe ILC.\n", "  We proposed a minimal model to describe the Floquet band structure of\ntwo-dimensional materials with light-induced resonant inter-band transition. We\napplied it to graphene to study the band features caused by the light\nirradiation. Linearly polarized light induces pseudo gaps (gaps are functions\nof wavevector), and circularly polarized light causes real gaps on the\nquasi-energy spectrum. If the polarization of light is linear and along the\nlongitudinal direction of zigzag ribbons, flat edge bands appear in the pseudo\ngaps, and if is in the lateral direction of armchair ribbons, curved edge bands\ncan be found. For the circularly polarized cases, edge bands arise and\nintersect in the gaps of both types of ribbons. The edge bands induced by the\ncircularly polarized light are helical and those by linearly polarized light\nare topologically trivial ones. The Chern number of the Floquet band, which\nreflects the number of pairs of helical edge bands in graphene ribbons, can be\nreduced into the winding number at resonance.\n", "  In this work, by applying the redshift tomography method to Joint Light-curve\nAnalysis (JLA) supernova sample, we explore the possible redshift-dependence of\nstretch-luminosity parameter $\\alpha$ and color-luminosity parameter $\\beta$.\nThe basic idea is to divide the JLA sample into different redshift bins,\nassuming that $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are piecewise constants. Then, by\nconstraining the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we check the consistency of cosmology-fit\nresults given by the SN sample of each redshift bin. We also adopt the same\ntechnique to explore the possible evolution of $\\beta$ in various subsamples of\nJLA. Using the full JLA data, we find that $\\alpha$ is always consistent with a\nconstant. In contrast, at high redshift $\\beta$ has a significant trend of\ndecreasing, at $\\sim 3.5\\sigma$ confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find that\nlow-$z$ subsample favors a constant $\\beta$; in contrast, SDSS and SNLS\nsubsamples favor a decreasing $\\beta$ at 2$\\sigma$ and $3.3\\sigma$ CL,\nrespectively. Besides, by using a binned parameterization of $\\beta$, we study\nthe impacts of $\\beta$'s evolution on parameter estimation. We find that\ncompared with a constant $\\beta$, a varying $\\beta$ yields a larger best-fit\nvalue of fractional matter density $\\Omega_{m0}$, which slightly deviates from\nthe best-fit result given by other cosmological observations. However, for both\nthe varying $\\beta$ and the constant $\\beta$ cases, the $1\\sigma$ regions of\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ are still consistent with the result given by other observations.\n", "  We report on the observation of periodic conductance oscillations near\nquantum Hall plateaus in suspended graphene nanoribbons. They are attributed to\nsingle quantum dots that form in the narrowest part of the ribbon, in the\nvalleys and hills of a disorder potential. In a wide flake with two gates, a\ndouble-dot system's signature has been observed. Electrostatic confinement is\nenabled in single-layer graphene due to the gaps that form between Landau\nlevels, suggesting a way to create gate-defined quantum dots that can be\naccessed with quantum Hall edge states.\n", "  Decoherence-free state (DFS) encoding supplies a useful way to avoid the\ndetrimental influence of the environment on quantum information processing. The\nDFS was previously well established in either the two subsystems locating at\nthe same spatial position or the dynamics under the Born--Markovian\napproximation. Here, we investigate the exact DFS of two spatially separated\nquantum systems consisting of two-level systems or harmonic oscillators coupled\nto a common non-Markovian zero-temperature bosonic environment. The exact\ndistance-dependent DFS and the explicit criterion for forming the DFS are\nobtained analytically, which reveals that the DFS can arise only in\none-dimensional environment. It is remarkable to further find that the DFS is\njust the system-reduced state of the famous bound state in the continuum (BIC)\nof the total system predicted by Wigner and von Neumann. On the one hand our\nresult gives insight into the physical nature of the DFS, and on the other hand\nit supplies an experimentally accessible scheme to realize the mathematically\ncurious BIC in the standard quantum optical systems.\n", "  The exclusive deep inelastic electroproduction of $\\psi(2S)$ and $J/\\psi(1S)$\nat an $ep$ centre-of-mass energy of 317 GeV has been studied with the ZEUS\ndetector at HERA in the kinematic range $2 < Q^2 < 80$ GeV$^2$, $30 < W < 210$\nGeV and $|t| < 1$ GeV$^2$, where $Q^2$ is the photon virtuality, $W$ is the\nphoton-proton centre-of-mass energy and $t$ is the squared four-momentum\ntransfer at the proton vertex. The data for $2 < Q^2 < 5$ GeV$^2$ were taken in\nthe HERA I running period and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 114\npb$^{-1}$. The data for $5 < Q^2 < 80$ GeV$^2$ are from both HERA I and HERA II\nperiods and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 468 pb$^{-1}$. The decay\nmodes analysed were $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $J/\\psi(1S) \\,\\pi^+\\pi^-$ for the\n$\\psi(2S)$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ for the $J/\\psi(1S)$. The cross-section ratio\n$\\sigma_{\\psi(2S)}/\\sigma_{J/\\psi(1S)}$ has been measured as a function of\n$Q^2, W$ and $t$. The results are compared to predictions of QCD-inspired\nmodels of exclusive vector-meson production.\n", "  If gamma-ray burst prompt emission originates at a typical radius, and if\nmaterial producing the emission moves at relativistic speed, then the\nvariability of the resulting light curve depends on the viewing angle. This is\ndue to the fact that the pulse evolution time scale is Doppler contracted,\nwhile the pulse separation is not. For off-axis viewing angles $\\theta_{\\rm\nview} \\gtrsim \\theta_{\\rm jet} + \\Gamma^{-1}$, the pulse broadening\nsignificantly smears out the light curve variability. This is largely\nindependent of geometry and emission processes. To explore a specific case, we\nset up a simple model of a single pulse under the assumption that the pulse\nrise and decay are dominated by the shell curvature effect. We show that such a\npulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a\ndifferent hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen\non-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical\nexplanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition\nof pulses changes with increasing viewing angle. We find that a highly variable\nlight curve, (as seen on-axis) becomes smooth and apparently single-pulsed\n(when seen off-axis) because of pulse overlap. To test the relevance of this\nfact, we estimate the fraction of off-axis gamma-ray bursts detectable by\n\\textit{Swift} as a function of redshift, finding that a sizable fraction\n(between 10\\% and 80\\%) of nearby ($z<0.1$) bursts are observed with\n$\\theta_{\\rm view} \\gtrsim \\theta_{\\rm jet} + \\Gamma^{-1}$. Based on these\nresults, we argue that low luminosity gamma-ray bursts are consistent with\nbeing ordinary bursts seen off-axis.\n", "  In recent years the idea that not only the configuration space of particles,\ni.e. spacetime, but also the corresponding momentum space may have nontrivial\ngeometry has attracted significant attention, especially in the context of\nquantum gravity. The aim of this letter is to extend this concept to the domain\nof field theories, by introducing field spaces (i.e. phase spaces of field\nvalues) that are not affine spaces. After discussing the motivation and general\naspects of our approach we present a detailed analysis of the prototype\n(quantum) Nonlinear Field Space Theory of a scalar field on the Minkowski\nbackground. We show that the nonlinear structure of a field space leads to\nnumerous interesting predictions, including: non-locality, generalization of\nthe uncertainty relations, algebra deformations, constraining of the maximal\noccupation number, shifting of the vacuum energy and renormalization of the\ncharge and speed of propagation of field excitations. Furthermore, a compact\nfield space is a natural way to implement the \"Principle of Finiteness\" of\nphysical theories, which once motivated the Born-Infeld theory. Thus the\npresented framework has a variety of potential applications in the theories of\nfundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity), as well as in condensed matter\nphysics (e.g. continuous spin chains), and can shed new light on the issue of\ndivergences in quantum field theories.\n", "  We prove that after an arbitrarily small adjustment of edge lengths, the\nspectrum of a compact quantum graph with $\\delta$-type vertex conditions can be\nsimple. We also show that the eigenfunctions, with the exception of those\nliving entirely on a looping edge, can be made to be non-vanishing on all\nvertices of the graph. As an application of the above result, we establish that\nthe secular manifold (also called \"determinant manifold\") of a large family of\ngraphs has exactly two smooth connected components.\n", "  Reconfigurable photonic devices capable of routing the flow of light enable\nflexible integrated-optic circuits that are not hard-wired but can be\nexternally controlled. Analogous to free-space spatial light modulators, we\ndemonstrate all-optical wavefront shaping in integrated silicon-on-insulator\nphotonic devices by modifying the spatial refractive index profile of the\ndevice employing ultraviolet pulsed laser excitation. Applying appropriate\nexcitation patterns grants us full control over the optical transfer function\nof telecommunication-wavelength light travelling through the device, thus\nallowing us to redefine its functionalities. As a proof-of-concept, we\nexperimentally demonstrate routing of light between the ports of a multimode\ninterference power splitter with more than 97% total efficiency and negligible\nlosses. Wavefront shaping in integrated photonic circuits provides a\nconceptually new approach toward achieving highly adaptable and\nfield-programmable photonic circuits with applications in optical testing and\ndata communication.\n", "  The structure of a two-dimensional honeycomb optical lattice potential with\nsmall inversion asymmetry is characterized using coherent diffraction of\n$^{87}$Rb atoms. We demonstrate that even a small potential asymmetry, with\npeak-to-peak amplitude of $\\leq 2.3\\%$ of the overall lattice potential, can\nlead to pronounced inversion asymmetry in the momentum-space diffraction\npattern. The observed asymmetry is explained quantitatively by considering both\nKapitza-Dirac scattering in the Raman-Nath regime, and also either perturbative\nor full-numerical treatment of the band structure of a periodic potential with\na weak inversion-symmetry-breaking term. Our results have relevance for both\nthe experimental development of coherent atom optics and the proper\ninterpretation of time-of-flight assays of atomic materials in optical\nlattices.\n", "  We adopt a boundary integral method to study the dynamics of a translating\ndroplet confined in a Hele-Shaw cell in the Stokes regime. The droplet is\ndriven by the motion of the ambient fluid with the same viscosity. We\ncharacterize the three-dimensional (3D) nature of the droplet interface and of\nthe flow field. The interface develops an arc-shaped ridge near the rear-half\nrim with a protrusion in the rear and a laterally symmetric pair of higher\npeaks; this pair of protrusions has been identified by recent experiments\n(Huerre et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 115 (6), 2015, 064501) and predicted\nasymptotically (Burgess and Foster, Phys. Fluids A, vol. 2 (7), 1990, pp.\n1105-1117). The mean film thickness is well predicted by the extended\nBretherton model (Klaseboer et al., Phys. Fluids, vol. 26 (3), 2014, 032107)\nwith fitting parameters. The flow in the streamwise wall-normal middle plane is\nfeatured with recirculating zones, which are partitioned by stagnation points\nclosely resembling those of a two-dimensional droplet in a channel.\nRecirculation is absent in the wall-parallel, unconfined planes, in sharp\ncontrast to the interior flow inside a moving droplet in free space. The\npreferred orientation of the recirculation results from the anisotropic\nconfinement of the Hele-Shaw cell. On these planes, we identify a dipolar\ndisturbance flow field induced by the travelling droplet and its $1/r^2$\nspatial decay is confirmed numerically. We pinpoint counter-rotating streamwise\nvortex structures near the lateral interface of the droplet, further\nhighlighting the complex 3D flow pattern.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that the dark matter candidate is from a pure\nnon-abelian gauge theory of the hidden sector, motivated in large part by its\nelegance and simplicity. The dark matter is the lightest bound state made of\nthe confined gauge fields, the hidden glueball. We point out this simple setup\nis capable of providing rich and novel phenomena in the dark sector, especially\nin the parameter space of large N. They include self-interacting and warm dark\nmatter scenarios, Bose-Einstein condensation leading to massive dark stars\npossibly millions of times heavier than our sun giving rise to gravitational\nlensing effects, and indirect detections through higher dimensional operators\nas well as interesting collider signatures.\n", "  Exceptional points are special parameter points in spectra of open quantum\nsystems, at which resonance energies degenerate and the associated eigenvectors\ncoalesce. Typical examples are Rydberg systems in parallel electric and\nmagnetic fields, for which we solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation in a complete\nbasis to calculate the resonances and eigenvectors. Starting from an avoided\ncrossing within the parameter-dependent spectra and using a two-dimensional\nmatrix model, we develop an iterative algorithm to calculate the field\nstrengths and resonance energies of exceptional points and to verify their\nbasic properties. Additionally, we are able to visualise the wave functions of\nthe degenerate states. We report the existence of various exceptional points.\nFor the hydrogen atom these points are in an experimentally inaccessible regime\nof field strengths. However, excitons in cuprous oxide in parallel electric and\nmagnetic fields, i. e., the corresponding hydrogen analogue in a solid state\nbody, provide a suitable system, where the high-field regime can be reached at\nmuch smaller external fields and for which we propose an experiment to detect\nexceptional points.\n", "  We study the dynamics of chiral quantum networks consisting of nodes coupled\nby unidirectional or asymmetric bidirectional quantum channels. In contrast to\nfamiliar photonic networks where driven two-level atoms exchange photons via 1D\nphotonic nanostructures, we propose and study a setup where interactions\nbetween the atoms are mediated by spin excitations (magnons) in 1D $XX$ spin\nchains representing spin waveguides. While Markovian quantum network theory\neliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov\napproximation to obtain a master equation for the nodes, we are interested in\nnon-Markovian dynamics. This arises from the nonlinear character of the\ndispersion with band-edge effects, and from finite spin propagation velocities\nleading to time delays in interactions. To account for the non-Markovian\ndynamics we treat the quantum degrees of freedom of the nodes and connecting\nchannels as a composite spin system with the surrounding of the quantum network\nas a Markovian bath, allowing for an efficient solution with time-dependent\ndensity matrix renormalization group techniques. We illustrate our approach\nshowing non-Markovian effects in the driven-dissipative formation of quantum\ndimers, and we present examples for quantum information protocols involving\nquantum state transfer with engineered elements as basic building blocks of\nquantum spintronic circuits.\n", "  We present nuclear magnetic resonance evidence that very slow ($\\leq 1$ MHz)\nspin fluctuations persist into the overdoped regime of\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Rh$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ superconductors. Measurements of the $^{75}$As\nspin echo decay rate, obtained both with Hahn Echo and Carr Purcell Meiboom\nGill pulse sequences, show that the slowing down of spin fluctuations can be\ndescribed by short-range diffusive dynamics, likely involving domain walls\nmotions separating $(\\pi/a,0)$ from $(0,\\pi/a)$ correlated regions. This\nslowing down of the fluctuations is weakly sensitive to the external magnetic\nfield and, although fading away with doping, it extends deeply into the\noverdoped regime.\n", "  We formulate a way to separate UV and IR contributions to the Adler function\nand discuss how $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}^2/Q^2$ dependence is encoded in the UV\ncontribution within perturbative QCD.\n", "  We exactly calculate two-point spatial correlation functions in steady state\nin a broad class of conserved-mass transport processes, which are governed by\nchipping, diffusion and coalescence of masses. We find that the spatial\ncorrelations are in general short-ranged and consequently, on a large scale,\nthese conserved-mass transport processes possess a remarkable thermodynamic\nstructure in the steady state. That is, the processes have an equilibriumlike\nadditivity property, and a corresponding fluctuation-response relation, which\nhelps us to obtain subsystem mass distributions in the limit of subsystem size\nlarge.\n", "  We present a digital algorithm for measuring the phase difference between two\nsinusoidal signals that combines the modified fringe-counting method with\ntwo-sample zero crossing to enable sequential signal processing. This technique\ncan be applied to a phase meter for measuring dynamic phase differences with\nhigh resolution, particularly for heterodyne interferometry. The floor noise\nobtained from a demonstration with an electrical apparatus is $5\\times10^{-8}\n\\mathrm{rad/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ at frequencies above approximately 0.1 Hz. In addition,\nby applying this method to a commercial heterodyne interferometer, the\nfloor-noise level is confirmed to be $7\\times10^{-14} \\mathrm{m/\\sqrt{Hz}}$\nfrom 4 kHz to 1 MHz. We also confirm the validity of the algorithm by comparing\nits results with those from a standard homodyne interferometer for measuring\nshock-motion peak acceleration greater than 5000 m/s^2 and a 10 mm stroke.\n", "  The thermoelectric effects in three-terminal structures with a quantum dot\nare considered. We propose the experimentally consistent protocol for\ndetermination of the transport coefficients in terms of the local and non-local\nconductances and thermopowers that can be measured in two steps, applying the\n`four probe technique'. This proposal is compared with other approaches\ndiscussed so far in the literature. As an example we study in detail the\nthermopower induced by the superconducting electrode in a subgap regime which\nmight be useful for analysis of novel hybrid devices.\n", "  We perform a detailed comparison of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD\npredictions for the W+jet and Z+jet processes with 7 TeV experimental data from\nATLAS and CMS. We observe excellent agreement between theory and data for most\nstudied observables, which span several orders of magnitude in both cross\nsection and energy. For some observables, such as the $H_T$ distribution, the\nNNLO QCD corrections are essential for resolving existing discrepancies between\ntheory and data.\n", "  In quantum metrology, it is widely believed that the quantum Cramer-Rao bound\nis attainable bound while it is not true. In order to clarify this point, we\nexplain why the quantum Cramer-Rao bound cannot be attained geometrically. In\nthis manuscript, we investigate noiseless channel estimation under energy\nconstraint for states, using a physically reasonable error function, and\npresent the optimal state and the attainable bound. We propose the experimental\ngeneration of the optimal states for enhanced metrology using squeezing\ntransformations. This makes the estimation of unitary channels physically\nimplementable, while existing unitary estimation protocols do not work\n", "  The branching fraction of the decay $B_{s}^{0} \\rightarrow\nD_{s}^{(*)+}D_{s}^{(*)-}$ is measured using $pp$ collision data corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of $1.0fb^{-1}$, collected using the LHCb detector\nat a centre-of-mass energy of $7$TeV. It is found to be \\begin{align*}\n  {\\mathcal{B}}(B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow~D_{s}^{(*)+}D_{s}^{(*)-}) = (3.05 \\pm 0.10\n\\pm 0.20 \\pm 0.34)\\%, \\end{align*} where the uncertainties are statistical,\nsystematic, and due to the normalisation channel, respectively. The branching\nfractions of the individual decays corresponding to the presence of one or two\n$D^{*\\pm}_{s}$ are also measured. The individual branching fractions are found\nto be \\begin{align*}\n  {\\mathcal{B}}(B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow~D_{s}^{*\\pm}D_{s}^{\\mp}) = (1.35 \\pm 0.06\n\\pm 0.09 \\pm 0.15)\\%,\n  \\newline{\\mathcal{B}}(B_{s}^{0}\\rightarrow~D_{s}^{*+}D_{s}^{*-}) = (1.27 \\pm\n0.08 \\pm 0.10 \\pm 0.14)\\%. \\end{align*} All three results are the most precise\ndeterminations to date.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionize transiting exoplanet\natmospheric science due to its capability for continuous, long-duration\nobservations and its larger collecting area, spectral coverage, and spectral\nresolution compared to existing space-based facilities. However, it is unclear\nprecisely how well JWST will perform and which of its myriad instruments and\nobserving modes will be best suited for transiting exoplanet studies. In this\narticle, we describe a prefatory JWST Early Release Science (ERS) program that\nfocuses on testing specific observing modes to quickly give the community the\ndata and experience it needs to plan more efficient and successful future\ntransiting exoplanet characterization programs. We propose a multi-pronged\napproach wherein one aspect of the program focuses on observing transits of a\nsingle target with all of the recommended observing modes to identify and\nunderstand potential systematics, compare transmission spectra at overlapping\nand neighboring wavelength regions, confirm throughputs, and determine overall\nperformances. In our search for transiting exoplanets that are well suited to\nachieving these goals, we identify 12 objects (dubbed \"community targets\") that\nmeet our defined criteria. Currently, the most favorable target is WASP-62b\nbecause of its large predicted signal size, relatively bright host star, and\nlocation in JWST's continuous viewing zone. Since most of the community targets\ndo not have well-characterized atmospheres, we recommend initiating preparatory\nobserving programs to determine the presence of obscuring clouds/hazes within\ntheir atmospheres. Measurable spectroscopic features are needed to establish\nthe optimal resolution and wavelength regions for exoplanet characterization.\nOther initiatives from our proposed ERS program include testing the instrument\nbrightness limits and performing phase-curve observations.(Abridged)\n", "  Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase is a two-dimensional bulk ferromagnetic\ninsulator with a nonzero Chern number in presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nbut absence of applied magnetic fields. Associated metallic chiral edge states\nhost dissipationless current transport in electronic devices. This intriguing\nQAH phase has recently been observed in magnetic impurity-doped topological\ninsulators, {\\it albeit}, at extremely low temperatures. Based on\nfirst-principles density functional calculations, here we predict that layered\nrhodium oxide K$_{0.5}$RhO$_2$ in noncoplanar chiral antiferromagnetic state is\nan unconventional three-dimensional QAH insulator with a large band gap and a\nNeel temperature of a few tens Kelvins. Furthermore, this unconventional QAH\nphase is revealed to be the exotic quantum topological Hall effect caused by\nnonzero scalar spin chirality due to the topological spin structure in the\nsystem and without the need of net magnetization and SOC.\n", "  Pair production of colored particles is in general accompanied by production\nof QCD bound states (onia) slightly below the pair-production threshold. Bound\nstate annihilation leads to resonant signals, which in some cases are easier to\nsee than the decays of the pair-produced constituents. In a previous paper\n(arXiv:1204.1119) we estimated the bound state signals, at leading order and in\nthe Coulomb approximation, for particles with various spins, color\nrepresentations and electric charges, and used 7 TeV ATLAS and CMS resonance\nsearches to set rough limits. Here we update our results to include 8 and 13\nTeV data. We find that the recently reported diphoton excesses near 750 GeV\ncould indeed be due to a bound state of this kind. A narrow resonance of the\ncorrect size could be obtained for a color-triplet scalar with electric charge\n-4/3 and mass near 375 GeV, if (as a recent lattice computation suggests) the\nwave function at the origin is somewhat larger than anticipated. Pair\nproduction of this particle could have evaded detection up to now. Other\ncandidates may include a triplet scalar of charge 5/3, a triplet fermion of\ncharge -4/3, and perhaps a sextet scalar of charge -2/3.\n", "  Two methods for detecting abrupt shifts in the variance, Integrated\nCumulative Sum of Squares (ICSS) and Sequential Regime Shift Detector (SRSD),\nhave been compared on both synthetic and observed time series. In Monte Carlo\nexperiments, SRSD outperformed ICSS in the overwhelming majority of the\nmodelled scenarios with different sequences of variance regimes. The SRSD\nadvantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When\ntested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same\nchange points in the longer series (252-787 monthly values). The only exception\nwas the Arctic Ocean SST series, when ICSS found one extra change point that\nappeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),\nICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or\ntripled from one regime to another. For these time series, SRSD is recommended.\nInterestingly, all the climatic time series tested, from the Arctic to the\nTropics, had one thing in common: the last shift detected in each of these\nseries was toward a high-variance regime. This is consistent with other\nfindings of increased climate variability in recent decades.\n", "  Colloidal shear thickening presents a significant challenge because the\nmacroscopic rheology becomes increasingly controlled by the microscopic details\nof short ranged particle interactions in the shear thickening regime. Our\nmeasurements here of the first normal stress difference over a wide range of\nparticle volume fraction elucidate the relative contributions from hydrodynamic\nlubrication and frictional contact forces, which have been debated. At moderate\nvolume fractions we find $N_1<0$, consistent with hydrodynamic models, however\nat higher volume fractions and shear stresses these models break down and we\ninstead observe dilation ($N_1>0$), indicating frictional contact networks.\nRemarkably, there is no signature of this transition in the viscosity, instead\nthis change in the sign of $N_1$ occurs while the shear thickening remains\ncontinuous. These results suggest a scenario where shear thickening is driven\nprimarily by the formation of frictional contacts, with hydrodynamic forces\nplaying a supporting role at lower concentrations. Motivated by this picture,\nwe introduce a simple model which combines these frictional and hydrodynamic\ncontributions and accurately fits the measured viscosity over a wide range of\nparticle volume fraction and shear stress.\n", "  We study the stability, form and interaction of single and multiple dark\nsolitons in quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates. The\nsolitons are found numerically as stationary solutions in the moving frame of a\nnon-local Gross Pitaevskii equation, and characterized as a function of the key\nexperimental parameters, namely the ratio of the dipolar atomic interactions to\nthe van der Waals interactions, the polarization angle and the condensate\nwidth. The solutions and their integrals of motion are strongly affected by the\nphonon and roton instabilities of the system. Dipolar matter-wave dark solitons\npropagate without dispersion, and collide elastically away from these\ninstabilities, with the dipolar interactions contributing an additional\nrepulsion or attraction to the soliton-soliton interaction. However, close to\nthe instabilities, the collisions are weakly dissipative.\n", "  The ability of background discrimination using pulse shape discrimination\n(PSD) in broad-energy germanium (BEGe) detectors makes them as competitive\ncandidates for neutrinoless double beta decay (0{\\nu}\\b{eta}\\b{eta})\nexperiments. The measurements of key parameters for detector modeling in a\ncommercial p-type BEGe detector are presented in this paper. Point-like sources\nwere used to investigate the energy resolution and linearity of the detector. A\ncylindrical volume source was used for the efficiency calibration. With an\nassembled device for source positioning, a collimated 133Ba point-like source\nwas used to scan the detector and investigate the active volume. A point-like\nsource of 241Am was used to measure the dead layer thicknesses, which are\napproximately 0.17 mm on the front and 1.18 mm on the side. The described\ncharacterization method will play an important role in the 0{\\nu}\\b{eta}\\b{eta}\nexperiments with BEGe detectors at China JinPing underground Laboratory (CJPL)\nin the future.\n", "  Superconducting circuits provide a new platform to study nonstationary cavity\nQED phenomena. An example of such a phenomenon is a dynamical Lamb effect which\nis a parametric excitation of an atom due to the nonadiabatic modulation of its\nLamb shift. This effect has been initially introduced for a natural atom in a\nvarying cavity, while we suggested its realization in a superconducting\nqubit-cavity system with dynamically tunable coupling. In the present paper, we\nstudy the interplay between the dynamical Lamb effect and the energy\ndissipation, which is unavoidable in realistic systems. We find that despite of\nnaive expectations this interplay can lead to unexpected dynamical regimes. One\nof the most striking results is that photon generation from vacuum can be\nstrongly enhanced due to the qubit relaxation, which opens a new channel for\nsuch a process. We also show that dissipation in the cavity can increase the\nqubit excited state population. Our results can be used for the experimental\nobservation and investigation of the dynamical Lamb effect and accompanying\nquantum effects.\n", "  In multiparty quantum systems, the monogamy inequality proposes an upper\nbound on the distribution of bipartite quantum correlation between a single\nparty and each of the remaining parties in the system, in terms of the amount\nof quantum correlation shared by that party with the rest of the system taken\nas a whole. However, it is well-known that not all quantum correlation measures\nuniversally satisfy the monogamy inequality. In this work, we aim at\ndetermining the non-trivial value by which the monogamy inequality can be\nviolated by a quantum correlation measure. Using an information-theoretic\ncomplementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum correlation\nin any given multiparty state, we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the\nnegative monogamy score for the quantum correlation measure. In particular, for\nthe three-qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von Neumann\nentropy of the single qubit reduced density matrix. We analytically examine the\ntightness of the derived lower bound for certain $n$-qubit quantum states.\nFurther, we report numerical results of the same for monogamy violating\ncorrelation measures using Haar uniformly generated three-qubit states.\n", "  We propose a simple and effective approach to construct the empirical\ntight-binding parameters of ternary alloys in the virtual crystal\napproximation. This combines a new, compact formulation of the strain\nparameters and a linear interpolation of the hamiltonians of binary materials\nstrained to the alloy equilibrium lattice parameter. We show that it is\npossible to obtain a perfect description of the bandgap bowing of ternary\nalloys in the InGaAsSb family of materials. Furthermore, this approach is in a\ngood agreement with supercell calculations using the same set of parameters.\nThis scheme opens a way for atomistic modeling of alloy-based opto-electronic\ndevices without extensive supercell calculations.\n", "  We present 1625 new 15 GHz (2 cm) VLBA images of 295 jets associated with\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MOJAVE and 2 cm VLBA surveys, spanning\nobservations between 1994 Aug 31 and 2013 Aug 20. For 274 AGNs with at least 5\nVLBA epochs, we have analyzed the kinematics of 961 individual bright features\nin their parsec-scale jets. A total of 122 of these jets have not been\npreviously analyzed by the MOJAVE program. In the case of 451 jet features that\nhad at least 10 epochs, we also examined their kinematics for possible\naccelerations. At least half of the well-sampled features have non-radial\nand/or accelerating trajectories, indicating that non-ballistic motion is\ncommon in AGN jets. Since it is impossible to extrapolate any accelerations\nthat occurred before our monitoring period, we could only determine reliable\nejection dates for about 24% of those features that had significant proper\nmotions. The distribution of maximum apparent jet speeds in all 295 AGNs\nmeasured by our program to date is peaked below 5c, with very few jets with\napparent speeds above 30c. The fastest speed in our survey is about 50c,\nmeasured in the jet of the quasar PKS 0805-07, and is indicative of a maximum\njet Lorentz factor of about 50 in the parent population. The Fermi LAT-detected\ngamma-ray AGNs in our sample have, on average, higher jet speeds than non\nLAT-detected AGNs, indicating a strong correlation between pc-scale jet speed\nand gamma-ray Doppler boosting factor. We have identified 11 moderate-redshift\n(z<0.35) AGNs with fast apparent speeds (>10c) that are strong candidates for\nfuture TeV gamma-ray detection. Of the five gamma-ray loud narrow-lined Seyfert\nI AGNs in our sample, three show highly superluminal jet motions, while the\nothers have sub-luminal speeds. (abridged)\n", "  A small contribution of molecular Bremsstrahlung radiation to the\nair-fluorescence yield in the UV range is estimated based on an approach\npreviously developed in the framework of the radio-detection of showers in the\ngigahertz frequency range. First, this approach is shown to provide an estimate\nof the main contribution of the fluorescence yield due to the de-excitation of\nthe C $^3\\Pi_{\\mathrm{u}}$ electronic level of nitrogen molecules to the B\n$^3\\Pi_{\\mathrm{g}}$ one amounting to $Y_{[337]}=(6.05\\pm 1.50)~$ MeV$^{-1}$ at\n800 hPa pressure and 293 K temperature conditions, which compares well to\nprevious dedicated works and to experimental results. Then, under the same\npressure and temperature conditions, the fluorescence yield induced by\nmolecular Bremsstrahlung radiation is found to be\n$Y_{[330-400]}^{\\mathrm{MBR}}=0.10~$ MeV$^{-1}$ in the wavelength range of\ninterest for the air-fluorescence detectors used to detect extensive air\nshowers induced in the atmosphere by ultra-high energy cosmic rays. This means\nthat out of $\\simeq 175~$ photons with wavelength between 330 and 400 nm\ndetected by fluorescence detectors, one of them has been produced by molecular\nBremsstrahlung radiation. Although small, this contribution is not negligible\nin regards to the total budget of systematic uncertainties when considering the\nabsolute energy scale of fluorescence detectors.\n", "  Among the various explanations of the possible 750 GeV diphoton resonance,\nthe possibility of it being an sgoldstino is an attractive one, as it is\nrelated to the spontaneous breaking of global supersymmetry. We discuss this\npossibility in this paper and point out the various theoretical issues\nassociated with it. In particular, we indicate the difficulties of this\nexplanation in realistic models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  The Goldstone theorem mandates that a spontaneous symmetry breaking entails\nthe emergence of gap(mass)less excitations. In the case where a rotational\ninvariance of a system of spin magnetic moments is broken by an\nantiferromagnetic order, these are well-known transverse spin waves. The\ninteraction of such Goldstone magnons with the Higgs amplitude mode of the\norder parameter is usually discarded, even though glimpses of Higgs physics\nhave recently been reported in a quantum magnet, a topological insulator, and\nferroelectric and disordered superconductor systems. The Goldstone-Higgs\ninteractions could be expected to grow in importance near a quantum critical\npoint (QCP), where the symmetry-breaking order is weak, and its amplitude\nfluctuations are significant. Here we report an electron spin resonance (ESR)\nstudy of a nearly one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain system, Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, which\npresents exactly such a case. The ESR spectra at $T > T_N$, in the disordered\nLuttinger-spin-liquid phase with unconfined spinons reveal ideal\nHeisenberg-chain behavior with only very small, field-independent linewidth,\n$\\sim 1/T$. In the ordered state, below $T_N$, we identify antiferromagnetic\nresonance (AFMR) modes, which are well described by pseudo-Goldstone magnons in\nthe model of a collinear biaxial antiferromagnet with two gaps, $\\Delta_1 =\n23.0$ GHz and $\\Delta_2 = 13.3$ GHz. Additionally, we observe a major resonant\nresponse of special nature, which we attribute to magnon interaction with the\nHiggs amplitude mode in a weakly ordered antiferromagnet. Its unusual field\ndependence indicates the presence of a quantum phase transition at $\\mu_0 H\n\\simeq 9.4$ T.\n", "  By making use of a low-energy effective model of Weyl semimetals, we show\nthat the Fermi arc transport is dissipative. The origin of the dissipation is\nthe scattering of the surface Fermi arc states into the bulk of the semimetal.\nIt is noticeable that corresponding scattering rate is nonzero and can be\nestimated even in a perturbative theory, although in general the reliable\ncalculations of transport properties necessitate a nonperturbative approach.\nNondecoupling of the surface and bulk sectors in the low-energy theory of Weyl\nsemimetals invalidates the usual argument of a nondissipative transport due to\none-dimensional arc states. This property of Weyl semimetals is in drastic\ncontrast to that of topological insulators, where the decoupling is protected\nby a gap in the bulk. Within the framework of the linear response theory, we\nobtain an approximate result for the conductivity due to the Fermi arc states\nand analyze its dependence on chemical potential, temperature, and other\nparameters of the model.\n", "  We consider the electromagnetic production of positron in collision of heavy\nnuclei, with the simultaneously produced electron captured by one of the\nnuclei. This cross-section exceeds by about four orders of magnitude the\ncross-section of $e^+ e^-$ production.\n", "  In order to solve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant, we\npropose a simple model with the vacuum energy non-minimally coupled to the\ninflaton field. In this model, the vacuum energy decays to the inflaton during\npre-inflation and inflation eras, so that the cosmological constant effectively\ndeflates from the Planck mass scale to a much smaller one after inflation and\nplays the role of dark energy in the late-time of the universe. We show that\nour deflationary scenario is applicable to arbitrary slow-roll inflation\nmodels. We also take two specific inflation potentials to illustrate our\nresults.\n", "  Micro-Laue diffraction and simultaneous rainbow-filtered micro-diffraction\nwere used to measure accurately the full strain tensor and the lattice\norientation distribution at the sub-micron scale in highly strained, suspended\nGe micro-devices. A numerical approach to obtain the full strain tensor from\nthe deviatoric strain measurement alone is also demonstrated and used for\nfaster full strain mapping. We performed the measurements in a series of\nmicro-devices under either uniaxial or biaxial stress and found an excellent\nagreement with numerical simulations. This shows the superior potential of Laue\nmicro-diffraction for the investigation of highly strained micro-devices.\n", "  Ideal graphene antidot lattices are predicted to show promising band gap\nbehavior (i.e., $E_G\\simeq 500$ meV) under carefully specified conditions.\nHowever, for the structures studied so far this behavior is critically\ndependent on superlattice geometry and is not robust against experimentally\nrealistic disorders. Here we study a rectangular array of triangular antidots\nwith zigzag edge geometries and show that their band gap behavior qualitatively\ndiffers from the standard behavior which is exhibited, e.g, by rectangular\narrays of armchair-edged triangles. In the spin unpolarized case, zigzag-edged\nantidots give rise to large band gaps compared to armchair-edged antidots,\nirrespective of the rules which govern the existence of gaps in armchair-edged\nantidot lattices. In addition the zigzag-edged antidots appear more robust than\narmchair-edged antidots in the presence of geometrical disorder. The inclusion\nof spin polarization within a mean-field Hubbard approach gives rise to a large\noverall magnetic moment at each antidot due to the sublattice imbalance imposed\nby the triangular geometry. Half-metallic behavior arises from the formation of\nspin-split dispersive states near the Fermi energy, reducing the band gaps\ncompared to the unpolarized case. This behavior is also found to be robust in\nthe presence of disorder. Our results highlight the possibilities of using\ntriangular perforations in graphene to open electronic band gaps in systems\nwith experimentally realistic levels of disorder, and furthermore, of\nexploiting the strong spin dependence of the system for spintronic\napplications.\n", "  We present the first results from an extended survey of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) using 41.1 h of observations by Spitzer-IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5$\\,\\mu$m. This\nsurvey extends previous observations to the outer disc and halo, covering total\nlengths of 4$.\\!\\!^\\circ$4 and 6$.\\!\\!^\\circ$6 along the minor and major axes,\nrespectively. We have produced surface brightness profiles by combining the\nintegrated light from background-corrected maps with stellar counts from a new\ncatalogue of point sources. Using auxiliary catalogues we have carried out a\nstatistical analysis in colour-magnitude space to discriminate M31 objects from\nforeground Milky Way stars and background galaxies. The catalogue includes\n426,529 sources, of which 66 per cent have been assigned probability values to\nidentify M31 objects with magnitude depths of [3.6]$\\,=\\,$19.0$\\,\\pm\\,$0.2,\n[4.5]$\\,=\\,$18.7$\\,\\pm\\,$0.2. We discuss applications of our data for\nconstraining the stellar mass and characterising point sources in the outer\nradii.\n", "  We consider the Kondo effect in Y-junctions of anisotropic XY models in an\napplied magnetic field along the critical lines characterized by a gapless\nexcitation spectrum. We find that, while the boundary interaction Hamiltonian\ndescribing the junction can be recasted in the form of a four-channel, spin-1/2\nantiferromagnetic Kondo Hamiltonian, the number of channels effectively\nparticipating in the Kondo effect depends on the chain parameters, as well as\non the boundary couplings at the junction. The system evolves from an effective\nfour-channel topological Kondo effect for a junction of XX-chains with\nsymmetric boundary couplings into a two-channel one at a junction of three\nquantum critical Ising chains. The effective number of Kondo channels depends\non the properties of the boundary and of the bulk. The XX-line is a \"critical\"\nline, where a four-channel topological Kondo effect can be recovered by\nfine-tuning the boundary parameter, while along the line in parameter space\nconnecting the extreme regimes, XX-line and the critical Ising point the\njunction is effectively equivalent to a two-channel topological Kondo\nHamiltonian. Using a renormalization group approach, we determine the flow of\nthe boundary couplings, which allows us to define and estimate the critical\ncouplings and Kondo temperatures of the different Kondo (pair) channels.\nFinally, we study the local transverse magnetization in the center of the\nY-junction, eventually arguing that it provides an effective tool to monitor\nthe onset of the two-channel Kondo effect.\n", "  We gauge the abelian hierarchy of tensor fields in 4D by a Lie algebra. The\nresulting non-abelian tensor hierarchy can be interpreted via an equivariant\nchain complex. We lift this structure to N=1 superspace by constructing\nsuperfield analogs for the tensor fields, along with covariant superfield\nstrengths. Next we construct Chern-Simons actions, for both the bosonic and N=1\ncases, and note that the condition of gauge invariance can be presented\ncohomologically. Finally, we provide an explicit realization of these\nstructures by dimensional reduction, for example by reducing the three-form of\neleven-dimensional supergravity into a superspace with manifest 4D, N=1\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  In this work we performed a detailed analysis on the calculation of 43\ncritical experiments from 6 experimental series all describing plutonium\nnitrate in aqueous solution contained in metal spheres. The underlying\nexperimental data is taken from the handbook of the International Criticality\nSafety Benchmark Evaluation Project (ICSBEP) Working Group. We present our\nmodeling assumptions which were derived from the interpretation of the\nexperimental data and discuss the resulting sensitivity analysis. Although the\nexperiments share some components, the derived correlation coefficients are for\nmany cases statistically not significant. Comparing our findings for the\ncorrelation coefficients with available data from the DICE Database we find an\nagreement for the correlation coefficients due to nuclear data. We also compare\nour results for the correlation coefficients due to experimental uncertainty.\nOur findings indicate that for the reliable Determination of correlation\ncoefficients a detailed study of the underlying experimental data, the modeling\napproach and assumptions, and the resulting sensitivity analysis seems to be\ninevitable.\n", "  It has been shown by explicit and exact calculation that whenever we have\ntaken the \\emph{effects of stable thermal fluctuations} the entropy product\nformula should \\emph{not be mass-independent} nor \\emph{does it quantized}. It\nhas been examined by giving some specific examples for non-rotating and\nrotating black hole.\n", "  Monolayers of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) are atomically thin\ntwo-dimensional crystals with attractive optoelectronic properties, which are\npromising for emerging applications in nanophotonics. Here, we report on the\nextraordinary spatial non-uniformity of the photoluminescence (PL) and strain\nproperties of WS2 monolayers exfoliated from the natural crystal. Specifically,\nit is shown that the edges of such monolayers exhibit remarkably enhanced PL\nintensity compared to their respective central area. A comprehensive analysis\nof the recombination channels involved in the PL process demonstrates a spatial\nnon-uniformity across the monolayer's surface and reflects on the\nnon-uniformity of the intrinsic electron density across the monolayer. Auger\nelectron imaging and spectroscopy studies complemented with PL measurements in\ndifferent environments indicate that oxygen chemisorption and physisorption are\nthe two fundamental mechanisms responsible for the observed non-uniformity. At\nthe same time Raman spectroscopy analysis shows remarkable strain variations\namong the different locations of an individual monolayer, however such\nvariations cannot be strictly correlated with the non-uniform PL emission. Our\nresults shed light on the role of the chemical bonding on the competition\nbetween exciton complexes in monolayer WS2, providing a way of engineering new\nnanophotonic functions using WS2 monolayers. It is therefore envisaged that our\nfindings could find diverse applications towards the development of TMDs-based\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  We identify the leading processes of electron transport across finite-length\nsegments of proximitized nanowires and build a quantitative theory of their\ntwo-terminal conductance. In the presence of spin-orbit interaction, a nanowire\ncan be tuned across the topological transition point by an applied magnetic\nfield. Due to a finite segment length, electron transport is controlled by the\nCoulomb blockade. Upon increasing of the field, the shape and magnitude of the\nCoulomb blockade peaks in the linear conductance is defined, respectively, by\nAndreev reflection, single-electron tunneling, and resonant tunneling through\nthe Majorana modes emerging after the topological transition. Our theory\nprovides the framework for the analysis of experiments with proximitized\nnanowires, such as reported in Albrecht et al., Nature 531, 206-209 (2016), and\nidentifies the signatures of the topological transition in the two-terminal\nconductance.\n", "  We discuss theoretical approaches to nonlinear optical spectroscopy of\nmolecular junctions. Optical response functions are derived in the form\nconvenient for implementation of Green function techniques, and their\nexpressions in terms of pseudoparticle nonequilibrium Green functions are\nproposed. The formulation allows to account for both intra-molecular\ninteractions and hybridization of molecular states due to coupling to contacts.\nTwo-dimensional optical spectroscopy in junctions is considered as an example.\n", "  We propose two setups for realizing a chiral quantum network, where two-level\nsystems representing the nodes interact via directional emission into discrete\nwaveguides, as introduced in T. Ramos et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 062104 (2016)].\nThe first implementation realizes a spin waveguide via Rydberg states in a\nchain of atoms, whereas the second one realizes a phonon waveguide via the\nlocalized vibrations of a string of trapped ions. For both architectures, we\nshow that strong chirality can be obtained by a proper design of synthetic\ngauge fields in the couplings from the nodes to the waveguide. In the Rydberg\ncase, this is achieved via intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the dipole-dipole\ninteractions, while for the trapped ions it is obtained by engineered sideband\ntransitions. We take long-range couplings into account that appear naturally in\nthese implementations, discuss useful experimental parameters, and analyze\npotential error sources. Finally, we describe effects that can be observed in\nthese implementations within state-of-the-art technology, such as the\ndriven-dissipative formation of entangled dimer states.\n", "  Dust transport and deposition behind larger boulders on the comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) have been observed by the Rosetta mission.\nWe present a mechanism for dust transport vectors based on a homogenous surface\nactivity model incorporating in detail the topography of 67P/C-G. The\ncombination of gravitation, gas drag, and Coriolis force leads to specific dust\ntransfer pathways, which for higher dust velocities fuel the near nucleus coma.\nBy distributing dust sources homogeneously across the whole cometary surface,\nwe derive a global dust-transport map of 67P/C-G. The transport vectors are in\nagreement with the reported wind-tail directions in the Philae descent area.\n", "  We present the serendipitous discovery of a projected pair of quasi-stellar\nobjects (QSOs) with an angular separation of $\\Delta\\theta =4.50$ arcsec. The\nredshifts of the two QSOs are widely different: one, our programme target, is a\nQSO with a spectrum consistent with being a narrow line Seyfert 1 AGN at\n$z=2.05$. For this target we detect Lyman-$\\alpha$, \\ion{C}{4}, and\n\\ion{C}{3]}. The other QSO, which by chance was included on the spectroscopic\nslit, is a Type 1 QSO at a redshift of $z=1.68$, for which we detect\n\\ion{C}{4}, \\ion{C}{3]} and \\ion{Mg}{2}. We compare this system to previously\ndetected projected QSO pairs and find that only about a dozen previously known\npairs have smaller angular separation.\n", "  We introduce a new method for the application of one-loop integrand reduction\nvia the Laurent expansion algorithm, as implemented in the public C++ library\nNinja. We show how the coefficients of the Laurent expansion can be computed by\nsuitable contractions of the loop numerator tensor with cut-dependent\nprojectors, making it possible to interface Ninja to any one-loop matrix\nelement generator that can provide the components of this tensor. We\nimplemented this technique in the Ninja library and interfaced it to MadLoop,\nwhich is part of the public MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. We performed a\ndetailed performance study, comparing against other public reduction tools,\nnamely CutTools, Samurai, IREGI, PJFry++ and Golem. We find that Ninja\noutperforms traditional integrand reduction in both speed and numerical\nstability, the latter being on par with that of the tensor integral reduction\ntool Golem which is however more limited and slower than Ninja. We considered\nmany benchmark multi-scale processes of increasing complexity, involving QCD\nand electro-weak corrections as well as effective non-renormalizable couplings,\nshowing that Ninja's performance scales well with both the rank and\nmultiplicity of the considered process.\n", "  In this work we use the holographic softwall AdS/QCD model with anomalous\ndimension contributions coming from two different QCD beta functions to\ncalculate the masses of higher spin glueball states for both even and odd spins\nand its respective Regge trajectories, related to the pomeron and the odderon,\nrespectively. We further investigate this model taking into account dynamical\ncorrections due to a dilaton potential consistent with Einstein equations in 5\ndimensions. The results found in this work for the Regge trajectories within\nthe anomalous softwall model with dynamical corrections are consistent with\nthose presented in the literature.\n", "  We determine exactly the mass-coupling relation for the simplest multi-scale\nquantum integrable model, the homogenous sine-Gordon model with two independent\nmass-scales. We first reformulate its perturbed coset CFT description in terms\nof the perturbation of a projected product of minimal models. This\nrepresentation enables us to identify conserved tensor currents on the UV side.\nThese UV operators are then mapped via form factor perturbation theory to\noperators on the IR side, which are characterized by their form factors. The\nrelation between the UV and IR operators is given in terms of the sought-for\nmass-coupling relation. By generalizing the $\\Theta$ sum rule Ward identity we\nare able to derive differential equations for the mass-coupling relation, which\nwe solve in terms of hypergeometric functions. We check these results against\nthe data obtained by numerically solving the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz\nequations, and find a complete agreement.\n", "  In cell proliferation, stem cell differentiation, chemoresistance and tissue\norganization, the ubiquitous role of YAP/TAZ continues to impact our\nfundamental understanding in numerous physiological and disease systems.\nYAP/TAZ is an important signaling nexus integrating diverse mechanical and\nbiochemical signals, such as ECM stiffness, adhesion ligand density, or\ncell-cell contacts, and thus strongly influences cell fate. Recent studies show\nthat YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.\nHowever, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the\nunknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To\nidentify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and\ntransduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling\npathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals\nvia adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with\ncytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue\nYAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that\nchanges of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ\nstiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to\nECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic\neffect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways\ncan be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model\nprovides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of\nintegrating different signaling pathways. This platform can be used to gain new\nfundamental insights into roles of key molecular and mechanical regulators on\ndevelopment, tissue engineering or tumor progression.\n", "  A superconductor in a magnetic field has surface currents that prevent the\nmagnetic field from penetrating its interior. These currents carry kinetic\nenergy and mechanical momentum. When the temperature is raised and the system\nbecomes normal the currents disappear. Where do the kinetic energy and\nmechanical momentum of the currents go, and how? Here we propose that the\nanswer to this question reveals a key necessary condition for materials to be\nsuperconductors, that is not part of conventional BCS-London theory:\nsuperconducting materials need to have hole carriers.\n", "  We extend the research program initiated in [Phys. Rev. A 92, 012338 (2015)],\nwhere we restricted our attention to noisy deterministic teleportation\nprotocols, to noisy probabilistic (conditional) protocols. Our main goal now is\nto study how we can increase the fidelity of the teleported state in the\npresence of noise by working with probabilistic protocols. We work with several\nscenarios involving the most common types of noise in realistic implementations\nof quantum communication tasks and find many cases where adding more noise to\nthe probabilistic protocol increases considerably the fidelity of the\nteleported state, without decreasing the probability of a successful run of the\nprotocol. Also, there are cases where the entanglement of the channel\nconnecting Alice and Bob leading to the greatest fidelity is not maximal.\nMoreover, there exist cases where the optimal fidelity for the probabilistic\nprotocols are greater than the maximal fidelity (2/3) achievable by using only\nclassical resources, while the optimal ones for the deterministic protocols\nunder the same conditions lie below this limit. This result clearly illustrates\nthat in some cases we can only get a truly quantum teleportation if we use\nprobabilistic instead of deterministic protocols.\n", "  We derive electronic structure models for weakly interacting bilayers such as\ngraphene-graphene and graphene-hexagonal boron nitride, based on density\nfunctional theory calculations followed by Wannier transformation of electronic\nstates. These transferable interlayer coupling models can be applied to\ninvestigate the physics of bilayers with arbitrary translations and twists. The\nfunctional form, in addition to the dependence on the distance, includes the\nangular dependence that results from higher angular momentum components in the\nWannier $p_z$ orbitals. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by\napplying it to a rotated graphene bilayer, which produces the analytically\npredicted renormalization of the Fermi velocity, van Hove singularities in the\ndensity of states, and Moir\\'{e} pattern of the electronic localization at\nsmall twist angles. We further extend the theory to obtain the effective\ncouplings by integrating out neighboring layers. This approach is instrumental\nfor the design of van der Walls heterostructures with desirable electronic\nfeatures and transport properties and for the derivation of low-energy theories\nfor graphene stacks, including proximity effects from other layers.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological semimetals come in different variants, either\ncontaining Weyl points or Dirac lines. Here we describe a more complicated\nmomentum-space topological defect where several separate Dirac lines connect\nwith each other, forming a momentum-space equivalent of the real-space nexus\nconsidered before for Helium-3. Close to the nexus the Dirac lines exhibit a\ntransition from type I to type II lines. We consider a general model of stacked\nhoneycomb lattices with the symmetry of Bernal (AB) stacked graphite and show\nthat the structural mirror symmetries in such systems protect the presence of\nthe Dirac lines, and also naturally lead to the formation of the nexus. By the\nbulk-boundary correspondence of topological media, the presence of Dirac lines\nlead to the formation of drumhead surface states at the side surfaces of the\nsystem. We calculate the surface state spectrum, and especially illustrate the\neffect of the nexus on these states.\n", "  Pure dephasing processes limit the fidelities achievable in\ndriven-dissipative schemes for stabilization of entangled states of qubits. We\npropose a scheme which, combined with already existing entangling methods,\npurifies the desired entangled state by driving out of equilibrium auxiliary\ndissipative cavity modes coupled to the qubits. We lay out the specifics of our\nscheme and compute its efficiency in the particular context of two\nsuperconducting qubits in a cavity-QED architecture, where the strongly coupled\nauxiliary modes provided by collective cavity excitations can drive and sustain\nthe qubits in maximally entangled Bell states with fidelities reaching 90% for\nexperimentally accessible parameters.\n", "  We study the characteristics of moving type IV radio bursts which extend to\nthe hectometric wavelengths (interplanetary type IV or type IV IP bursts) and\ntheir relationship with energetic phenomena on the Sun. Our dataset comprises\n48 interplanetary type IV bursts observed with Wind/WAVES in the 13.825 MHz-20\nkHz frequency range. The dynamic spectra of the RSTN, the Nancay Decametric\nArray (DAM), the ARTEMIS-IV, the Culgoora, Hiraiso and Izmiran Radio\nSpectrographs were used to track the evolution of the events in the low corona.\nThese were supplemented with SXR flux data from the GOES and CME data from the\nSOHO/LASCO. Positional information of the coronal bursts was obtained by the\nNRH. We examined the relationship of the type IV events with coronal radio\nbursts, CMEs and SXR flares. The majority of the events (45) were characterized\nas compact; their duration was on average 106 minutes. This type of events was,\nmostly, associated with M-and X-class flares (40 out of 45) and fast CMEs; 32\nof these events had CMEs faster than 1000 km/s. Furthermore, in 43 compact\nevents the CME was, possibly, subjected to reduced aerodynamic drag as it was\npropagating in the wake of a previous CME. A minority (three) of long lived\ntype IV IP bursts was detected, with duration from 960 minutes to 115 hours.\nThese events are referred to as extended or long duration and appear to\nreplenish their energetic electron content, possibly from electrons escaping\nfrom the corresponding coronal type IV bursts. The latter were found to persist\non the disk, for tens of hours to days. Prominent among them was the unusual\ninterplanetary type IV burst of 18--23 May 2002, which is the longest event in\nthe Wind/WAVES catalog. The three extended events were, usually, accompanied by\na number of flares, of GOES class C in their majority, and of CMEs, many of\nwhich were slow and narrow.\n", "  We present our recent effort to develop a GPGPU program to calculate 52\nchannels of the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter (NBS) wave functions in order to study the\nbaryon interactions, from nucleon-nucleon to $\\Xi-\\Xi$, from lattice QCD. We\nadopt CUDA programming to perform the multi-GPU execution on a hybrid parallel\nprogramming with MPI and OpenMP. Effective baryon block algorithm is briefly\noutlined, which calculates efficaciously a large number of NBS wave functions\nat a time, and three CUDA kernel programs are implemented to materialize the\neffective baryon block algorithm using GPUs on the single-program multiple-data\n(SPMD) programming model. In order to parallelize multiple GPUs, we take both\ntwo approaches by dividing the time dimension and by dividing the spatial\ndimensions. Performances are measured using HA-PACS supercomputer in University\nof Tsukuba, which includes NVIDIA M2090 and NVIDIA K20X GPUs. Strong scaling\nand weak scaling measured by using both M2090 and K20X GPUs are presented. We\nfind distinct difference between the M2090 and the K20X in the sustained\nperformance measurement of particular kernel executions which utilize the\ncudaStream objects.\n", "  Observation of a point source of astrophysical neutrinos would be a \"smoking\ngun\" signature of a cosmic-ray accelerator. While IceCube has recently\ndiscovered a diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos, no localized point source\nhas been observed. Previous IceCube searches for point sources in the southern\nsky were restricted by either an energy threshold above a few hundred TeV or\npoor neutrino angular resolution. Here we present a search for southern sky\npoint sources with greatly improved sensitivities to neutrinos with energies\nbelow 100 TeV. By selecting charged-current $\\nu_{\\mu}$ interacting inside the\ndetector, we reduce the atmospheric background while retaining efficiency for\nastrophysical neutrino-induced events reconstructed with sub-degree angular\nresolution. The new event sample covers three years of detector data and leads\nto a factor of ten improvement in sensitivity to point sources emitting below\n100 TeV in the southern sky. No statistically significant evidence of point\nsources was found, and upper limits are set on neutrino emission from\nindividual sources. A posteriori analysis of the highest-energy ~100 TeV\nstarting event in the sample found that this event alone represents a\n$2.8\\sigma$ deviation from the hypothesis that the data consists only of\natmospheric background.\n", "  We present the new semi-analytic model of galaxy evolution, DARK SAGE, a\nheavily modified version of the publicly available SAGE code. The model is\ndesigned for detailed evolution of galactic discs. We evolve discs in a series\nof annuli with fixed specific angular momentum, which allows us to make\npredictions for the radial and angular-momentum structure of galaxies. Most\nphysical processes, including all channels of star formation and associated\nfeedback, are performed in these annuli. We present the surface density\nprofiles of our model spiral galaxies, both as a function of radius and\nspecific angular momentum, and find the discs naturally build a\npseduobulge-like component. Our main results are focussed on predictions\nrelating to the integrated mass--specific angular momentum relation of stellar\ndiscs. The model produces a distinct sequence between these properties in\nremarkable agreement with recent observational literature. We investigate the\nimpact Toomre disc instabilities have on shaping this sequence and find they\nare crucial for regulating both the mass and spin of discs. Without\ninstabilities, high-mass discs would be systematically deficient in specific\nangular momentum by a factor of ~2.5, with increased scatter. Instabilities\nalso appear to drive the direction in which the mass--spin sequence of spiral\ngalaxy discs evolves. With them, we find galaxies of fixed mass have higher\nspecific angular momentum at later epochs.\n", "  The inner surfaces of the electrodes encompassing the gas volume of a\nResistive Plate Chamber (RPC) have been found to exhibit asperities with,\ngrossly, three kinds of features. The desired uniform electric field within the\ngas volume of RPC is expected to be affected due to the presence of these\nasperities, which will eventually affect the final response from the detector.\nIn this work, an attempt has been made to model the highly complex roughness of\nthe electrode surfaces and compute its effect on the electrostatic field within\nRPC gas chamber. The calculations have been performed numerically using Finite\nElement Method (FEM) and Boundary Element Method (BEM) and the two methods have\nbeen compared in this context.\n", "  A right-right-left extension of the standard model is proposed. In this\nmodel, the standard model gauge group $SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y $ is extended to\n$SU(2)_L \\otimes SU(2)_R \\otimes SU(2)^{\\prime}_R \\otimes SU(2)^{\\prime}_L\n\\otimes U(1)_{Y}$. The gauge symmetries $SU(2)^{\\prime}_R$, $SU(2)^{\\prime}_L$\nare the mirror counter-parts of the $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ respectively.\nParity is spontaneously broken when the scalar Higgs fields acquire\nvacuum-expectation values in a certain pattern. Parity is restored at the scale\nof $SU(2)^{\\prime}_L$. The gauge sector has a unique pattern. The scalar sector\nof the model is optimum, elegant and unique.\n", "  This paper theoretically analyzes a phenomenological stochastic model for\nbacterial growth. This model comprises cell division and the linear growth of\ncells, where growth rates and cell cycles are drawn from lognormal\ndistributions. We find that the cell size is expressed as a sum of independent\nlognormal variables. We show numerically that the quality of the lognormal\napproximation greatly depends on the distributions of the growth rate and cell\ncycle. Furthermore, we show that actual parameters of the growth rate and cell\ncycle take values that give a good lognormal approximation; thus, the\nexperimental cell-size distribution is in good agreement with a lognormal\ndistribution.\n", "  In this work we review what we consider are, some of the most relevant\nresults of heavy-ion physics at the LHC. This paper is not intended to cover\nall the many important results of the experiments, instead we present a brief\noverview of the current status on the characterization of the hot and dense QCD\nmedium produced in the heavy-ion collisions. Recent exciting results which are\nstill under debate are discussed too, leading to intriguing questions like\nwhether we have a real or fake QGP formation in small systems.\n", "  We model, for the first time, the Bondi-Hoyle accretion of a fluid with\nvelocity gradients onto a Kerr black hole, by numerically solving the fully\nrelativistic hydrodynamics equations. Specifically, we consider a supersonic\nideal gas, which has velocity gradients perpendicular to the relative motion.\nWe measure the mass and specific angular accretion rates to illustrate whether\nthe fluid presents unstable patterns or not. The initial parameters, we\nconsider in this work, are the velocity gradient $\\epsilon_{v}$, the black hole\nspin $a$, the asymptotic Mach number ${\\cal M}_{\\infty}$ and adiabatic index\n$\\Gamma$. We show that the flow accretion reaches a fairly stationary regime,\nunlike in the Newtonian case, where significant fluctuations of the mass and\nangular momentum accretion rates are found. On the other hand, we consider a\nspecial case where both density and velocity gradients of the fluid are taken\ninto account. The spin of the black hole and the asymptotic Newtonian Mach\nnumber, for this case, are $a=0.98$ and ${\\cal M}_{\\infty}=1$, respectively. A\nkind of flip-flop behavior is found at the early times; nevertheless, the\nsystem also reaches a steady state.\n", "  Gauge theories are fundamental to our understanding of interactions between\nthe elementary constituents of matter as mediated by gauge bosons. However,\ncomputing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for\nclassical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum\nsimulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes\nfor simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the\ndifficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws\n(Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by\nrealising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a\nfew-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time\nevolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare\nvacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous\ncreation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum\nresources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge\nfields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and\nefficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger\nmechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production\nand the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time\nevolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle\ncreation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents\na first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic\nphysics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time\nquantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.\n", "  We show that measurement-based quantum computation on scalable\ncontinuous-variable (CV) cluster states admits more quantum-circuit flexibility\nand compactness than similar protocols for standard square-lattice CV cluster\nstates. This advantage is a direct result of the macronode structure of these\nstates---that is, a lattice structure in which each graph node actually\nconsists of several physical modes. These extra modes provide additional\nmeasurement degrees of freedom at each graph location, which can be used to\nmanipulate the flow and processing of quantum information more robustly and\nwith additional flexibility that is not available on an ordinary lattice.\n", "  We consider a model of two qubits dissipating into both local and global\nenvironments (generally at non-zero temperatures), with the possibility of\ninterpolating between purely local dissipation and purely global one. The\ncorresponding dissipative dynamical map is characterized in terms of its Kraus\noperators focusing on the stationary regime. We then determine conditions under\nwhich entanglement can be induced by the action of such a map. It results\n(rather counterintuitively) that in order to have entanglement in the presence\nof local environment, this latter must be at nonzero temperature.\n", "  We show that several interpretations of quantum mechanics admit an ontology\nof objects and events. This ontology reduces the breach between mind and\nmatter. When humans act, their actions do not appear explainable in mechanical\nterms but through mental activity: motives, desires or needs that propel them\nto action. These are examples of what in the last few decades have come to be\ncalled \"downward causation\". Basically, downward causation is present when the\ndisposition of the whole to behave in a certain way cannot be predicted from\nthe dispositions of the parts. The event ontology of quantum mechanics allow us\nto show that systems in entangled states present emergent new properties and\ndownward causation.\n", "  In a magnetic field superconductors (SC) with small orbital effect exhibit\nthe Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase above the Pauli limiting\nfield. It is characterized by Cooper pairs with finite center of mass momentum\nand is stabilized by the gain in Zeeman energy of depaired electrons in the\nimbalanced Fermi gas. The ground state is a coherent superposition of paired\nand depaired states. This concept, although central to the FFLO state lacks a\ndirect experimental confirmation. We propose that STM quasiparticle\ninterference (QPI) can give a direct momentum space image of the depaired\nstates in the FFLO wave function. For a proof of principle we investigate a 2D\nsingle orbital tight binding model with a SC s-wave order parameter. Using the\nequilibrium values of pair momentum and SC gap we calculate the spectral\nfunction of quasiparticles and associated QPI spectrum as function of magnetic\nfield. We show that the characteristic depaired Fermi surface parts appear as a\nfingerprint in the QPI spectrum of the FFLO phase and we demonstrate its\nevolution with field strength. Its observation in STM experiments would\nconstitute a direct proof for FFLO ground state wave function.\n", "  Atomically thin transitional metal ditellurides like WTe2 and MoTe2 have\ntriggered tremendous research interests because of their intrinsic nontrivial\nband structure. They are also predicted to be 2D topological insulators and\ntype-II Weyl semimetals. However, most of the studies on ditelluride atomic\nlayers so far rely on the low-yield and time-consuming mechanical exfoliation\nmethod. Direct synthesis of large-scale monolayer ditellurides has not yet been\nachieved. Here, using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, we\ndemonstrate controlled synthesis of high-quality and atom-thin tellurides with\nlateral size over 300 {\\mu}m. We found that the as-grown WTe2 maintains two\ndifferent stacking sequences in the bilayer, where the atomic structure of the\nstacking boundary is revealed by scanning transmission electron microscope\n(STEM). The low-temperature transport measurements revealed a novel\nsemimetal-to-insulator transition in WTe2 layers and an enhanced\nsuperconductivity in few-layer MoTe2. This work paves the way to the synthesis\nof atom-thin tellurides and also quantum spin Hall devices.\n", "  Germanium is a strong candidate as a laser source for silicon photonics. It\nis widely accepted that the band structure of germanium can be altered by\ntensile strain so as to reduce the energy difference between its direct and\nindirect band gaps. However, the conventional deformation potential model most\nwidely adopted to describe this transformation happens to have been\ninvestigated only up to 1 % uniaxially loaded strains. In this work, we use a\nmicro-bridge geometry to uniaxially stress germanium along [100] up to\n$\\varepsilon_{100}$=3.3 % longitudinal strain and then perform\nelectro-absorption spectroscopy. We accurately measure the energy gap between\nthe conduction band at the $\\Gamma$ point and the light- and heavy-hole valence\nbands. While the experimental results agree with the conventional linear\ndeformation potential theory up to 2 % strain, a significantly nonlinear\nbehavior is observed at higher strains. We measure the deformation potential of\ngermanium to be a = -9.1 $\\pm$ 0.3 eV and b = -2.32 $\\pm$ 0.06 eV and introduce\na second order deformation potential. The experimental results are found to be\nwell described by tight-binding simulations. These new high strain coefficients\nwill be suitable for the design of future CMOS-compatible lasers and\nopto-electronic devices based on highly strained germanium.\n", "  Statistical similarities between earthquakes and other systems that emit\ncracking noises have been explored in diverse contexts, ranging from materials\nscience to financial and social systems. Such analogies give promise of a\nunified and universal theory for describing the complex responses of those\nsystems. There are, however, very few attempts to simultaneously characterize\nthe most fundamental seismic laws in such systems. Here we present a complete\ndescription of the Gutenberg-Richter law, the recurrence times, Omori's law,\nthe productivity law, and Bath's law for the acoustic emissions that happen in\nthe relaxation process of uncrumpling thin plastic sheets. Our results show\nthat these laws also appear in this phenomenon, but (for most cases) with\ndifferent parameters from those reported for earthquakes and fracture\nexperiments. This study thus contributes to elucidate the parallel between\nseismic laws and cracking noises in uncrumpling processes, revealing striking\nqualitative similarities but also showing that these processes display unique\nfeatures.\n", "  The composition, crystal structure and precipitation crystallography of a\nnewly found precipitate are characterized by a Cs-corrected scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM). The composition of the plate-like\nprecipitate could be expressed as MgxAl2-xGd (x = 0.38), and its crystal\nstructure is the same as the fcc type Laves phases Mg2Gd and Al2Gd with the\nlattice parameter of 7.92 Angstrom (space group No. 227, Fd-3m). The\norientation relationship between the matrix and precipitate is found to be\n(0001)m // (111)p and [10-10]m // [1-10]p, and the habit plane is parallel to\n(0001)m // (111)p plane. In addition, this preferred crystallography of phase\ntransformation is well explained based on the atomic matching in the interface.\n", "  The forward proton detectors, already existing at the LHC, are considered in\nthe context of heavy ion collisions. It is shown that such detectors have the\npotential to measure nuclear debris originating from spectator nucleons. The\ngeometric acceptance for different nuclei is studied, and how it is affected by\nthe motion of the nucleons in the nucleus and by the experimental conditions. A\npossibility of extending the acceptance region is discussed.\n", "  Pressure-induced transitions from ordered intermetallic phases to\nsubstitutional alloys to semi-ordered phases were studied in a series of\nbismuth tellurides. Using angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction, the compounds\nBi4Te5, BiTe, and Bi2Te were observed to form alloys with the disordered\nbody-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure upon compression to above 14--19\nGPa at room temperature. The BiTe and Bi2Te alloys and the previously\ndiscovered high-pressure alloys of Bi2Te3 and Bi4Te3 were all found to show\natomic ordering after gentle annealing at very moderate temperatures of\n~100{\\deg}C. Upon annealing, BiTe transforms from the bcc to the B2 (CsCl)\ncrystal structure type, and the other phases adopt semi-disordered variants\nthereof, featuring substitutional disorder on one of the two crystallographic\nsites. The transition pressures and atomic volumes of the alloy phases show\nsystematic variations across the Bi_mTe_n series including the end members Bi\nand Te. First-principles calculations were performed to characterize the\nelectronic structure and chemical bonding properties of B2-type BiTe and to\nidentify the driving forces of the ordering transition. The calculated Fermi\nsurface of B2-type BiTe has an intricate structure and is predicted to undergo\nthree topological changes between 20 and 60 GPa.\n", "  We study the nonlinear dynamics of globally coupled nonidentical oscillators\nin the framework of two order parameter (mean field and amplitude-frequency\ncorrelator) reduction. The main result of the paper is the exact solution of\nthe corresponding nonlinear system on an attracting manifold. We present a\ncomplete classification of phase portraits and bifurcations, obtain explicit\nexpressions for invariant manifolds (a limit cycle among them) and derive\nanalytical solutions for arbitrary initial data and different regimes.\n", "  The g2p/GEp experiments used a solid NH3 polarized target, where the\npolarization of the target is sensitive to temperature and radiation. The beam\ncurrent was limited to 5-100 nA during the experiment to avoid too much\ndepolarization of target (The typical Hall A running condition for beam current\nis 1 uA to 100 uA). The measured charge was further used to get the accurate\nphysics cross sections. New BCM (Beam Current Monitor) receivers and a DAQ\nsystem were used to measure the beam current at such a low current range. A\ntungsten calorimeter was used to calibrate the BCMs. This technical note\nsummarizes the calibration procedure and the performance of the BCMs.\n", "  We study the dynamical generation of the chiral chemical potential in a Weyl\nmetal constructed from a three-dimensional optical lattice and subject to\nsynthetic gauge fields. By numerically solving the Boltzmann equation with the\nBerry curvature in the presence of parallel synthetic electric and magnetic\nfields, we find that the spectral flow and the ensuing chiral magnetic current\nemerge. We show that the spectral flow and the chiral chemical potential can be\nprobed by time-of-flight imaging.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze Vaidya spacetime with an energy dependent metric in\nGalileon gravity's rainbow. This will be done using the rainbow functions which\nare motivated from the results obtained in loop quantum gravity approach and\nnon-commutative geometry. We will investigate the Gravitational collapse in\nthis Galileon gravity's rainbow. We will discuss the behavior of singularities\nformed from the gravitational collapse in this rainbow deformed Galileon\ngravity.\n", "  Alice is a far-ultraviolet imaging spectrograph onboard Rosetta that, amongst\nmultiple objectives, is designed to observe emissions from various atomic and\nmolecular species from within the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The\ninitial observations, made following orbit insertion in August 2014, showed\nemissions of atomic hydrogen and oxygen spatially localized close to the\nnucleus and attributed to photoelectron impact dissociation of H2O vapor.\nWeaker emissions from atomic carbon were subsequently detected and also\nattributed to electron impact dissociation, of CO2, the relative H I and C I\nline intensities reflecting the variation of CO2 to H2O column abundance along\nthe line-of-sight through the coma. Beginning in mid-April 2015, Alice\nsporadically observed a number of outbursts above the sunward limb\ncharacterized by sudden increases in the atomic emissions, particularly the\nsemi-forbidden O I 1356 multiplet, over a period of 10-30 minutes, without a\ncorresponding enhancement in long wavelength solar reflected light\ncharacteristic of dust production. A large increase in the brightness ratio O I\n1356/O I 1304 suggests O2 as the principal source of the additional gas. These\noutbursts do not correlate with any of the visible images of outbursts taken\nwith either OSIRIS or the navigation camera. Beginning in June 2015 the nature\nof the Alice spectrum changed considerably with CO Fourth Positive band\nemission observed continuously, varying with pointing but otherwise fairly\nconstant in time. However, CO does not appear to be a major driver of any of\nthe observed outbursts.\n", "  We propose that feedback-delayed manual tracking performance is limited by\nfundamental constraints imposed by the physics of negative group delay. To test\nthis hypothesis, the results of an experiment in which subjects demonstrate\nboth reactive and predictive dynamics are modeled by a linear system with\ndelay-induced negative group delay. Although one of the simplest real-time\npredictors conceivable, this model explains key components of experimental\nobservations. Most notably, it explains the observation that prediction time\nlinearly increases with feedback delay, up to a certain point when tracking\nperformance deteriorates. It also explains the transition from reactive to\npredictive behavior with increasing feedback delay. The model contains only one\nfree parameter, the feedback gain, which has been fixed by comparison with one\nset of experimental observations for the reactive case. Our model provides\nquantitative predictions that can be tested in further experiments.\n", "  Echo atom interferometers have emerged as interesting alternatives to Raman\ninterferometers for the realization of precise measurements of the\ngravitational acceleration $g$ and the determination of the atomic fine\nstructure through measurements of the atomic recoil frequency $\\omega_q$. Here\nwe review the development of different configurations of echo interferometers\nthat are best suited to achieve these goals. We describe experiments that\nutilize near-resonant excitation of laser-cooled rubidium atoms by a sequence\nof standing wave pulses to measure $\\omega_q$ with a statistical uncertainty of\n37 parts per billion (ppb) on a time scale of $\\sim 50$ ms and $g$ with a\nstatistical precision of 75 ppb. Related coherent transient techniques that\nhave achieved the most statistically precise measurements of atomic g-factor\nratios are also outlined. We discuss the reduction of prominent systematic\neffects in these experiments using off-resonant excitation by low-cost,\nhigh-power lasers.\n", "  Despite the fact that more that more than 30 analytical expressions for the\nequation of state of hard-disk fluids have been proposed in the literature,\nnone of them is capable of reproducing the currently accepted numeric or\nestimated values for the first eighteen virial coefficients. Using the\nasymptotic expansion method, extended to the first ten virial coefficients for\nhard-disk fluids, fifty-seven new expressions for the equation of state have\nbeen studied. Of these, a new equation of state is selected which reproduces\naccurately all the first eighteen virial coefficients. Comparisons for the\ncompressibility factor with computer simulations show that this new equation is\nas accurate as other similar expressions with the same number of parameters.\nFinally, the location of the poles of the 57 new equations shows that there are\nsome particular configurations which could give both the accurate virial\ncoefficients and the correct closest packing fraction in the future when higher\nvirial coefficients than the tenth are numerically calculated.\n", "  Although many equations of state of hard-disk fluids have been proposed, none\nis capable of reproducing the currently calculated or estimated values of the\nfirst eighteen virial coefficients at the same time as giving very good\naccuracy when compared with computer simulation values for the compressibility\nfactor over the whole fluid range. A new virial-based expression is here\nproposed which achieves these aims. For that, we use the fact that the\ncurrently accepted estimated values for the highest virial coefficients behave\nlinearly with their order, and also that virial coefficients must have a\nlimiting behaviour that permits the closest packing limit in the\ncompressibility factor to be also adequately reproduced.\n", "  The optical/ultraviolet (UV) variability of quasars has been discovered to be\ncorrelated with other quasar properties, such as luminosity, black hole mass\nand rest-frame wavelength. However,the origin of variability has been a puzzle\nso far. In this work, we upgrade the accretion disc model (Li & Cao 2008),\nwhich assumed the variability is caused by the change of global mass accretion\nrate, by constraining the disc size to match the viscous timescale of accretion\ndisc to the variability timescale observed and by including the\nirradiation/X-ray reprocessing to make the emitted spectrum become steeper. We\nfind this hybrid model can reproduce the observed bluer-when-brighter trend\nquite well, which is used to validate the theoretical model by several works\nrecently. The traditional correlation between the variability amplitude and\nrest-frame wavelength can also be well fitted by our model. In addition, a weak\npositive correlation between variability amplitude and black hole mass is\npresent, qualitatively consistent with recent observations.\n", "  We propose a hydrodynamic model for a spheroidal microswimmer with two\ntangential surface velocity modes. This model is analytically solvable and\nreduces to Lighthill's and Blake's spherical squirmer model in the limit of\nequal major and minor semi-axes. Furthermore, we present an implementation of\nsuch a spheroidal squirmer by means of multiparticle collision dynamics\nsimulations. We investigate its properties as well as the scattering of two\nspheroidal squirmers in a slit geometry. Thereby we find a stable fixed point,\nwhere two pullers swim cooperatively forming a wedge-like conformation with a\nsmall constant angle.\n", "  Generalized Ising models, also known as cluster expansions, are an important\ntool in many areas of condensed-matter physics and materials science, as they\nare often used in the study of lattice thermodynamics, solid-solid phase\ntransitions, magnetic and thermal properties of solids, and fluid mechanics.\nHowever, the problem of finding the global ground state of generalized Ising\nmodel has remained unresolved, with only a limited number of results for simple\nsystems known. We propose a method to efficiently find the periodic ground\nstate of a generalized Ising model of arbitrary complexity by a new algorithm\nwhich we term cluster tree optimization. Importantly, we are able to show that\neven in the case of an aperiodic ground state, our algorithm produces a\nsequence of states with energy converging to the true ground state energy, with\na provable bound on error. Compared to the current state-of-the-art polytope\nmethod, this algorithm eliminates the necessity of introducing an exponential\nnumber of variables to counter frustration, and thus significantly improves\ntractability. We believe that the cluster tree algorithm offers an intuitive\nand efficient approach to finding and proving ground states of generalized\nIsing Hamiltonians of arbitrary complexity, which will help validate\nassumptions regarding local vs. global optimality in lattice models, as well as\noffer insights into the low-energy behavior of highly frustrated systems.\n", "  The results of long XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the NW radio relic of\nAbell 3667 are presented. A shock is detected at the sharp outer edge of the\nradio relic, both in the X-ray surface brightness and the temperature profiles.\nThe Mach number is M = 2.54^+0.80_-0.43. The temperature jump at the shock is\nlarger than expected from the density jump, which may indicate that a\ndynamically important magnetic field aligned primarily parallel to the shock\nfront is present. The gas temperature rises gradually over several arc minutes\nwithin the shock region. This could indicate that the shock energy is initially\ndissipated into some mix of thermal and nonthermal (e.g., turbulence)\ncomponents, and that the nonthermal energy decays into heat in the post-shock\nregion. The observed radio relic can be powered if ~0.2% of the energy\ndissipated in the shock goes into the (re)acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons. We show that the observed steepening of the radio spectrum with\ndistance behind the shock is consistent with radiative losses by the\nradio-emitting electrons. However, the radio spectrum immediately behind the\nshock is flatter than expected for linear diffusive shock acceleration of\nthermal electrons. This suggests that the shock re-accelerates a pre-existing\npopulation of relativistic electrons. We also detect a bright, cool region (the\n\"Mushroom\") to the south of the radio relic, which we propose is the remnant\ncool core of a merging subcluster, and that this subcluster was the driver for\nthe observed NW shock. In this model, the properties of Abell 3667 are mainly\nthe result of an offset binary merger, and the cluster is being observed about\n1 Gyr after first core passage. We predict that deeper X-ray or SZ observations\nof the SE radio relic will reveal a second merger shock at the outer edge.\n", "  A new detector is being developed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron\nLaboratory (NSCL) to measure low energy charged-particles from beta-delayed\nparticle emission. These low energy particles are very important for nuclear\nastrophysics studies. The use of a gaseous system instead of a solid state\ndetector decreases the sensitivity to betas while keeping high efficiency for\nhigher mass charged particles like protons or alphas. This low sensitivity to\nbetas minimizes their contribution to the background down to 150 keV. A\ndetailed simulation tool based on \\textsc{Geant4} has been developed for this\nfuture detector.\n", "  The paper considers an opportunity of detecting explosives by using radiation\ncapture of a neutron with nitrogen nucleus. Proton LINAC is offered as the\nneutron source with the following parameters: proton energy five Mega electron\nVolts , beam pulse current one and seven-tenths milliampere, duration of the\ncurrent pulse two hundreds microseconds, repetition rate fifty Hertz. The\nreaction in which neutrons are formed is lithium (p,n) beryllium. It is shown\nthat this neutron source will have the intensity of ten to the twelfth degree\nneutron per second that will allow one to detect explosives of the size of a\ntennis ball.\n", "  The cancellation between off-shell two body forces and three body forces\nimplies a tremendous simplification in the study of three body resonances in\ntwo meson-one baryon systems. While this can be done by means of Faddeev\nequations we provide an alternative and simpler derivation using just the\nchiral Lagrangian and the field re-parametrization invariance.\n", "  Upgraded electronics, improved water system dynamics, better calibration and\nanalysis techniques allowed Super-Kamiokande-IV to clearly observe very\nlow-energy 8B solar neutrino interactions, with recoil electron kinetic\nenergies as low as 3.49 MeV. Super-Kamiokande-IV data-taking began in September\nof 2008; this paper includes data until February 2014, a total livetime of 1664\ndays. The measured solar neutrino flux is (2.308+-0.020(stat.) +\n0.039-0.040(syst.)) x 106/(cm2sec) assuming no oscillations. The observed\nrecoil electron energy spectrum is consistent with no distortions due to\nneutrino oscillations. An extended maximum likelihood fit to the amplitude of\nthe expected solar zenith angle variation of the neutrino-electron elastic\nscattering rate in SK-IV results in a day/night asymmetry of\n(-3.6+-1.6(stat.)+-0.6(syst.))%. The SK-IV solar neutrino data determine the\nsolar mixing angle as sin2 theta_12 = 0.327+0.026-0.031, all SK solar data\n(SK-I, SK-II, SK III and SKIV) measures this angle to be sin2 theta_12 =\n0.334+0.027-0.023, the determined mass-squared splitting is Delta m2_21 =\n4.8+1.5-0.8 x10-5 eV2.\n", "  We develop a theoretical formula of spin Hall torque in the presence of two\nferromagnets. While the direction of the conventional spin Hall torque always\npoints to the in-plane direction, the present system enables to manipulate the\ntorque direction acting on one magnetization by changing the direction of\nanother magnetization. Based on the diffusion equation of the spin accumulation\nand the Landauer formula, we derive analytical formula of the spin Hall torque.\nThe present model provides a solution to switch a perpendicular ferromagnet\ndeterministically at zero field using the spin Hall effect.\n", "  Large networks are becoming a widely used abstraction for studying complex\nsystems in a broad set of disciplines, ranging from social network analysis to\nmolecular biology and neuroscience. Despite an increasing need to analyze and\nmanipulate large networks, only a limited number of tools are available for\nthis task.\n  Here, we describe Stanford Network Analysis Platform (SNAP), a\ngeneral-purpose, high-performance system that provides easy to use, high-level\noperations for analysis and manipulation of large networks. We present SNAP\nfunctionality, describe its implementational details, and give performance\nbenchmarks. SNAP has been developed for single big-memory machines and it\nbalances the trade-off between maximum performance, compact in-memory graph\nrepresentation, and the ability to handle dynamic graphs where nodes and edges\nare being added or removed over time. SNAP can process massive networks with\nhundreds of millions of nodes and billions of edges. SNAP offers over 140\ndifferent graph algorithms that can efficiently manipulate large graphs,\ncalculate structural properties, generate regular and random graphs, and handle\nattributes and meta-data on nodes and edges. Besides being able to handle large\ngraphs, an additional strength of SNAP is that networks and their attributes\nare fully dynamic, they can be modified during the computation at low cost.\nSNAP is provided as an open source library in C++ as well as a module in\nPython.\n  We also describe the Stanford Large Network Dataset, a set of social and\ninformation real-world networks and datasets, which we make publicly available.\nThe collection is a complementary resource to our SNAP software and is widely\nused for development and benchmarking of graph analytics algorithms.\n", "  We study force generation by a set of parallel actin filaments growing\nagainst a non-rigid obstacle, in presence of an external load. The filaments\npolymerize by either moving the whole obstacle, with a large energy cost, or by\ncausing local distortion in its shape which costs much less energy. The\nnon-rigid obstacle also has local thermal fluctuations due to which its shape\ncan change with time and we describe this using fluctuations in the height\nprofile of a one dimensional interface with Kardar-Parisi-Zhang dynamics. We\nfind the shape fluctuations of the barrier strongly affects the force\ngeneration mechanism. The qualitative nature of the force-velocity curve is\ncrucially determined by the relative time-scale of filament and barrier\ndynamics. The height profile of the barrier also shows interesting variation\nwith the external load. Our analytical calculation within mean-field theory\nshows reasonable agreement with our simulation results.\n", "  The discoveries of Dirac and Weyl semimetal states in spin-orbit compounds\nled to the realizations of elementary particle analogs in table-top\nexperiments. In this paper, we propose the concept of a three-dimensional\ntype-II Dirac fermion and identify a new topological semimetal state in the\nlarge family of transition-metal icosagenides, MA3 (M=V, Nb, Ta; A=Al, Ga, In).\nWe show that the VAl3 family features a pair of strongly Lorentz-violating\ntype-II Dirac nodes and that each Dirac node consists of four type-II Weyl\nnodes with chiral charge +/-1 via symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we predict\nthe Landau level spectrum arising from the type-II Dirac fermions in VAl3 that\nis distinct from that of known Dirac semimetals. We also show a topological\nphase transition from a type-II Dirac semimetal to a quadratic Weyl semimetal\nor a topological crystalline insulator via crystalline distortions. The new\ntype-II Dirac fermions, their novel magneto-transport response, the topological\ntunability and the large number of compounds make VAl3 an exciting platform to\nexplore the wide-ranging topological phenomena associated with\nLorentz-violating Dirac fermions in electrical and optical transport,\nspectroscopic and device-based experiments.\n", "  Flexible tendon sheath mechanism is commonly used in NOTES systems because it\noffers high flexibility, light weight, and easy transmission. Due to the size\nconstraints and sterilization problems, traditional sensors like force/torque\nsensor are extremely difficult to place at the tool tips of surgical arms. In\naddition, nonlinear dynamic friction and backlash cause challenges to provide\nhaptic feedback to the surgeons when the robotic arms are inside the patient's\nbody. Hence, it is extremely difficult to provide the force information to\nhaptic devices and subsequently to the surgeons. To deal with these problems,\nin this paper we propose a new approach of friction model in the tendon-sheath\nmechanism to provide the force at distal end of endoscopic system. In\ncomparison with current approaches in the literature, the proposed model is\nable to provide force information at zero velocity and it is smooth. In\naddition, the model is independent configuration and able to capture friction\nforce with any complex sheath shapes. A suitable experimental setup is\nestablished to validate the proposed approach using the two degrees of freedom\nMaster-Slave system. The validity of the proposed approach is confirmed with a\ngood agreement between the estimated model and real experimental data. Finally,\na force feedback structure is also given for use in flexible endoscopic\nsystems.\n", "  In this contribution, a discretisation of the IBC EFIE is introduced that (i)\nyields the correct solution at arbitrarily small frequencies, (ii) requires for\nits solution a number of matrix vector products bounded as the frequency tends\nto zero and as the mesh density increases. The low frequency stabilisation is\nbased on a projector-based discrete Helmholtz splitting, rescaling, and\nrecombination that depends on the low frequency behaviour of both the EFIE\noperator and the surface impedance condition. The dense mesh stabilisation is a\nmodifcation of the Perfect Electric Conductor operator preconditioning approach\ntaking into account the effect on the singular value spectrum of the IBC term.\n", "  In this talk we review relations and representations of primitive QCD tree\namplitudes. Topics covered include the BCJ relations, the CHY representation,\nand the KLT relations. We will put a special emphasis on how these relations\nand representations generalise from pure Yang-Mills theory to QCD. The\ngeneralisation of the KLT relations from pure Yang-Mills to QCD includes the\ncase of massive quarks. On the gravity side we then obtain hypothetical\nparticles interacting with gravitational strength, which can be massive and\nnon-relativistic.\n", "  We have demonstrated a frequency-stabilized tunable 318.6 nm ultraviolet (UV)\nlaser system for the single-photon 6S1/2 - nP (n = 70 ~ 100) Rydberg excitation\nof cesium atoms. The 637.2 nm laser produced by single-pass sum frequency\ngeneration from two infrared fiber lasers is offset locked to a high-finesse\nultra-low expansion (ULE) optical cavity placed in ultra-high vacuum using the\nelectronic sideband locking technique. The generated 318.6 nm UV laser via\ncavity-enhanced second-harmonic generation can be continuously tuned over 4 GHz\nby indirectly changing modulation frequency on the electro-optic phase\nmodulator while the whole laser system remains locked. We analyze the tuning\nrange mainly depends on the modulator bandwidth and the tunable range of the\nseed laser. The locking scheme offers a method to compensate the frequency\ndifference between the reference frequency and the goal frequency to a desired\nexcited state, and has huge potential in precision spectroscopic experiments of\ncold atoms.\n", "  We propose a method to give a $d+1$ geometry from a $d$ dimensional quantum\nfield theory in the large N expansion. We first construct a $d+1$ dimensional\nfield from the $d$ dimensional one using the gradient flow equation, whose flow\ntime $t$ represents the energy scale of the system such that $t\\rightarrow 0$\ncorresponds to the ultra-violet (UV) while $t\\rightarrow\\infty$ to the\ninfra-red (IR). We define the induced metric using $d+1$ dimensional field\noperators. We show that the metric defined in this way becomes classical in the\nlarge N limit: quantum fluctuations of the metric are suppressed as 1/N due to\nthe large $N$ factorization property. As a concrete example, we apply our\nmethod to the O(N) non-linear $\\sigma$ model in two dimensions. We calculate\nthe three dimensional induced metric, which describes an AdS space in the\nmassless limit. We finally discuss several open issues for future\ninvestigations.\n", "  We present the first official release of the nCTEQ nuclear parton\ndistribution functions (nPDFs) with errors. The main addition to the previous\nnCTEQ PDFs is the introduction of PDF uncertainties based on the Hessian\nmethod. Another important improvement is the inclusion of pion production data\nfrom RHIC giving us a handle to constrain gluon PDF. In this presentation we\nbriefly discuss the framework of our analysis and concentrate on the comparison\nof our results with those of other groups.\n", "  We consider a toroidal extra-dimensional space with shape moduli $\\theta$\nwhich is the angle between the two large extra dimensions $R_1$ and $R_2$\n(twisted LED with $\\delta=2$). The Kaluza-Klein (KK) compactification results\nin a tower of KK bulk neutrinos which are sterile in nature and couple to the\nactive neutrinos in the brane. The active-sterile mixing probability strongly\ndepends on the angle $\\theta$ due to changing pattern of KK mass gaps which\nleads to level crossing. Considering only the first two lowest KK states in\nanalogy with $(3+2)$ model, it is shown that $|U_{\\alpha 4}| > |U_{\\alpha 5}|$\nwhen $\\theta = \\pi/2$ corresponding to the case of a normal torus. Since\n$\\Delta_{14}^2 < \\Delta_{15}^2$, this is expected in normal LED model as higher\nthe sterile mass lower is the mixing probability. Contrary to this expectation,\nit is found that there exists a range in $\\theta$ where $|U_{\\alpha 5}| \\ge\n|U_{\\alpha 4}|$ even though $\\Delta m_{14}^2 < \\Delta m_{15}^2$ which has been\ndemonstrated qantitatively using fourier transformation of reactor\nanti-neutrino spectrum. This is an important observation which can be linked to\nthe oscillation parameters extracted by several $(3+2)$ global analyses of the\nneutrino and anti-neutrino data obtained from the short base line measurements.\n", "  The tunable properties of molecular materials place them among the favorites\nfor a variety of future generation devices. In addition, to maintain the\ncurrent trend of miniaturization of those devices, a departure from the present\ntop-down production methods may soon be required and self-assembly appears\namong the most promising alternatives. On-surface synthesis unites the promises\nof molecular materials and of self-assembly, with the sturdiness of covalently\nbonded structures: an ideal scenario for future applications. Following this\nidea, we report the synthesis of functional extended nanowires by\nself-assembly. In particular, the products correspond to one-dimensional\norganic semiconductors. The uniaxial alignment provided by our substrate\ntemplates allows us to access with exquisite detail their electronic\nproperties, including the full valence band dispersion, by combining local\nprobes with spatial averaging techniques. We show how, by selectively doping\nthe molecular precursors, the product's energy level alignment can be tuned\nwithout compromising the charge carrier's mobility.\n", "  By implementing four-wave mixing (FWM) micro-spectroscopy we measure\ncoherence and population dynamics of the exciton transitions in monolayers of\nMoSe$_2$. We reveal their dephasing times T$_2$ and radiative lifetime T$_1$ in\na sub-picosecond (ps) range, approaching T$_2$=2T$_1$, and thus indicating\nradiatively limited dephasing at a temperature of 6$\\,$K. We elucidate the\ndephasing mechanisms by varying the temperature and by probing various\nlocations on the flake exhibiting a different local disorder. At a nanosecond\nrange, we observe the residual FWM produced by the incoherent excitons, which\ninitially disperse towards the dark states, but then relax back to the\noptically active states within the light cone. By introducing\npolarization-resolved excitation, we infer inter-valley exciton dynamics,\nshowing an initial polarization degree of around 30$\\,\\%$, constant during the\ninitial sub-picosecond decay, followed by the depolarization on a picosecond\ntimescale. The FWM hyperspectral imaging reveals the doped and undoped areas of\nthe sample, allowing to investigate the neutral exciton, the charged one or\nboth transitions at the same time. In the latter case, we observe the\nexciton-trion beating in the coherence evolution indicating their coherent\ncoupling.\n", "  Surface confined dehalogenation reactions are versatile bottom-up approaches\nfor the synthesis of carbon-based nanostructures with predefined chemical\nproperties. However, for devices generally requiring low conductivity\nsubstrates, potential applications are so far severely hampered by the\nnecessity of a metallic surface to catalyze the reactions. In this work we\nreport the synthesis of ordered arrays of poly(p-phenylene) chains on the\nsurface of semiconducting TiO2(110) via a dehalogenative homocoupling of\n4,4\"-dibromoterphenyl precursors. The supramolecular phase is clearly\ndistinguished from the polymeric one using low energy electron diffraction and\nscanning tunneling microscopy as the substrate temperature used for deposition\nis varied. X ray photoelectron spectroscopy of C 1s and Br 3d core levels\ntraces the temperature of the onset of dehalogenation to around 475 K.\nMoreover, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and tight-binding\ncalculations identify a highly dispersive band characteristic of a substantial\noverlap between the precursor's {\\pi} states along the polymer, considered as\nthe fingerprint of a successful polymerization. Thus, these results establish\nthe first spectroscopic evidence that atomically precise carbon based\nnanostructures can readily be synthesized on top of a transition-metal oxide\nsurface, opening the prospect for the bottom-up production of novel\nmolecule-semiconductor devices.\n", "  We present a software package, IDA, which can easily handle two-dimensional\nspectroscopy data. IDA has been written in IDL and offers a window-based\ninterface. The available tools can visualize a recovered image from spectra at\nany desired wavelength interval, obtain velocity fields, velocity dispersion\ndistributions, etc.\n", "  To which degree are shape indices of individual cells of a tessellation\ncharacteristic for the stochastic process that generates them? Within the\ncontext of stochastic geometry and the physics of disordered materials, this\ncorresponds to the question of relationships between different stochastic\nmodels. In the context of image analysis of synthetic and biological materials,\nthis question is central to the problem of inferring information about\nformation processes from spatial measurements of resulting random structures.\nWe address this question by a theory-based simulation study of shape indices\nderived from Minkowski tensors for a variety of tessellation models. We focus\non the relationship between two indices: an isoperimetric ratio of the\nempirical averages of cell volume and area and the cell elongation quantified\nby eigenvalue ratios of interfacial Minkowski tensors. Simulation data for\nthese quantities, as well as for distributions thereof and for correlations of\ncell shape and volume, are presented for Voronoi mosaics of the Poisson point\nprocess, determinantal and permanental point processes, and Gibbs hard-core and\nrandom sequential absorption processes as well as for Laguerre tessellations of\npolydisperse spheres and STIT- and Poisson hyperplane tessellations. These data\nare complemented by mechanically stable crystalline sphere and disordered\nellipsoid packings and area-minimising foam models. We find that shape indices\nof individual cells are not sufficient to unambiguously identify the generating\nprocess even amongst this limited set of processes. However, we identify\nsignificant differences of the shape indices between many of these tessellation\nmodels. Given a realization of a tessellation, these shape indices can narrow\nthe choice of possible generating processes, providing a powerful tool which\ncan be further strengthened by density-resolved volume-shape correlations.\n", "  The transition form factors responsible for the radiative $\\Sigma_Q \\to\n\\Lambda_Q \\gamma$ and $\\Xi_Q^\\prime \\to \\Xi \\gamma$ decays of the negative\nparity baryons are examined within light cone QCD sum rules. The decay widths\nof the radiative transitions are calculated using the obtained results of the\nform factors.\n", "  We present a resonantly frequency-doubled tapered amplified semiconductor\nlaser system emitting up to 2.6 W blue light at 400 nm. The output power is\nstable on both short and long timescales with 0.12% RMS relative intensity\nnoise, and less than 0.15%/h relative power loss over 16 hours of free running\ncontinuous operation. Furthermore, the output power can be actively stabilized,\nand the alignment of the input beams of the tapered amplifier chip, the\nfrequency doubling cavity and-in case of fiber output-the fiber can be\noptimized automatically using computer-controlled mirrors.\n", "  GaSb/InAs/GaSb layer stacks have been grown on InAs metamorphic substrates\n(pseudosubstrates) by MOVPE, using nitrogen as major carrier gas. We\ndemonstrate that GaSb growth by nitrogen MOVPE on InAs metamorphic substrates\n(and on InAs wafers) is possible in a very narrow range of growth parameters.\nAs demonstrators, GaSb/InAs/GaSb structures were grown for electron mobility\ntests, obtaining (unintentional) 2D electron gas densities in the order of\n9/5x10e12 cm(e-2) and mobilities up to 1.2/1.8x10e4 cm(e2)/Vs at room and\nliquid nitrogen temperature respectively. We show that it is beneficial to have\nsome hydrogen in the carrier gas mixture for GaSb growth to achieve good\ncrystal quality, morphology and electrical properties. Furthermore, an\nunexpected and previously unreported decomposition process of GaSb is observed\nat relatively low growth temperatures under the supply of the precursors for\nInAs epitaxial overgrowth. This nevertheless gets suppressed at even lower\ngrowth temperatures.\n", "  In this work we consider the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) universe in the framework\nof varying speed of light theory. We present the general solutions of the\ngravitational field equations with variable speed of light $c(t)$,\ngravitational coupling parameter $G(t)$ and the decaying vacuum energy\n$\\Lambda(t)$ for the KS model. In the limiting case for the equation of state\n(EOS) parameter $\\gamma=2$ (stiff fluid with $p=\\rho c^2$) and $\\gamma =1$\n(dust with $p=0$), exact solutions of the field equations are obtained. The\nnumerical solutions are also presented for both the cases. Moreover, it is\nshown that in the limiting case of large time, the mean anisotropy parameter\ntends to zero for $\\gamma=2$ and $\\gamma=1$. Thus the time variation of the\nfundamental constants provides an effective mechanism for the isotropization of\nthe KS universe.\n", "  In the near future various types of low-carbon technologies (LCTs) are\nexpected to be widely employed throughout the United Kingdom. However, the\neffect that these technologies will have at a household level on the existing\nlow voltage (LV) network is still an area of extensive research. We propose an\nagent based model that estimates the growth of LCTs within local\nneighbourhoods, where social influence is imposed. Real-life data from a LV\nnetwork is used that comprises of many socially diverse neighbourhoods. Both\nelectric vehicle uptake and the combined scenario of electric vehicle and\nphotovoltaic adoption are investigated with this data. A probabilistic approach\nis outlined, which determines lower and upper bounds for the model response at\nevery neighbourhood. This technique is used to assess the implications of\nmodifying model assumptions and introducing new model features. Moreover, we\ndiscuss how the calculation of these bounds can inform future network planning\ndecisions.\n", "  The out-of-plane fluctuations of carbon atoms in a graphene sheet have been\nstudied by means of classical molecular dynamic simulations with an empirical\nforce-field as a function of temperature. The Fourier analysis of the\nout-of-plane fluctuations often applied to characterize the acoustic bending\nmode of graphene is extended to the optical branch, whose polarization vector\nis perpendicular to the graphene layer. This observable is inaccessible in a\ncontinuous elastic model of graphene but it is readily obtained by the\natomistic treatment. Our results suggest that the long-wavelength limit of the\nacoustic out-of-plane fluctuations of a free layer without stress is\nqualitatively similar to that predicted by a harmonic model under a tensile\nstress. This conclusion is a consequence of the anharmonicity of both in-plane\nand out-of-plane vibrational modes of the lattice. The most striking anharmonic\neffect is the presence of a linear term, $\\omega_{A}=v_{A}k$, in the dispersion\nrelation of the acoustic bending band of graphene at long wavelengths\n($k\\rightarrow0$). This term implies a strong reduction of the amplitude of\nout-of-plane oscillations in comparison to a flexural mode with a\n$k^{2}$-dependence in the long-wavelength limit. Our simulations show an\nincrease of the sound velocity associated to the bending mode, as well as an\nincrease of its bending constant, $\\kappa,$ as the temperature increases.\nMoreover, the frequency of the optical bending mode, $\\omega_{O}(\\Gamma)$, also\nincreases with the temperature. Our results are in agreement with recent\nanalytical studies of the bending modes of graphene using either perturbation\ntheory or an adiabatic approximation in the framework of continuous layer\nmodels.\n", "  We experimentally study the mixing of binary granular systems in a horizontal\nrotating cylinder. When materials have the same size and differ by dynamic\nangle of repose only, we observe an axial transport of matter that generates\ntransient radial segregation. The system then evolves towards homogeneity. If\nmaterials differ by density also radial segregation becomes steady. A mechanism\nis suggested where radial segregation is promoted by axial differences of\ndynamic angle of repose. This differs from the free surface segregation\nsuggested so far to explain radial segregation.\n", "  Let $X_1,X_2, \\ldots $ be a sequence of $i.i.d$ real (complex) $d \\times d $\ninvertible random matrices with common distribution $\\mu$ and $\\sigma_1(n),\n\\sigma_2(n), \\ldots , \\sigma_d(n)$ be the singular values, $\\lambda_1(n),\n\\lambda_2(n), \\ldots , \\lambda_d(n)$ be the eigenvalues of $X_nX_{n-1}\\cdots\nX_1$ in the decreasing order of their absolute values for every $n$. It is\nknown that if $\\mathbb{E}(\\log^{+}\\|X_1\\|)< \\infty$, then with probability one\nfor all $1 \\leq p \\leq d$, $$\n  \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n}\\log \\sigma_p(n)=\\gamma_p, $$ where\n${\\gamma_1,\\gamma_2 \\ldots \\gamma_d}$ are the Lyapunov exponents associated\nwith $\\mu$. In this paper we show that under certain support and moment\nconditions on $\\mu$, the absolute values of eigenvalues also exhibit the same\nasymptotic behaviour. In fact, a stronger asymptotic relation holds between the\nsingular values and the eigenvalues $i.e.$ for any $r>0$ with probability one\nfor all $1 \\leq p \\leq d$, $$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n^r}\\log\n\\left(\\frac{|\\lambda_p(n)|}{\\sigma_p(n)}\\right)= 0, $$ which implies that the\nfluctuations of the eigenvalues have the same asymptotic distribution as that\nof the corresponding singular values. Isotropic random matrices and also random\nmatrices with $i.i.d$ real elements, which have some finite moment and bounded\ndensity whose support contains an open set, are shown to satisfy the moment and\nsupport conditions under which the above relations hold.\n", "  Quantized magnetotransport is observed in 5.6 x 5.6 mm^2 epitaxial graphene\ndevices, grown using highly constrained sublimation on the Si-face of SiC(0001)\nat high temperature (1900 {\\deg}C). The precise quantized Hall resistance of\nRxy = h/2e^2 is maintained up to record level of critical current Ixx = 0.72 mA\nat T = 3.1 K and 9 T in a device where Raman microscopy reveals low and\nhomogeneous strain. Adsorption-induced molecular doping in a second device\nreduced the carrier concentration close to the Dirac point(n ~ 1E10 (1/cm^2)),\nwhere mobility of 43700 cm^2/Vs is measured over an area of 10 mm^2. Atomic\nforce, confocal optical, and Raman microscopies are used to characterize the\nlarge-scale devices, and reveal improved SiC terrace topography and the\nstructure of the graphene layer. Our results show that the structural\nuniformity of epitaxial graphene produced by face-to-graphite processing\ncontributes to millimeter-scale transport homogeneity, and will prove useful\nfor scientific and commercial applications.\n", "  A clock steps a computer through a cycle of phases. For the propagation of\nlogical symbols from one computer to another, each computer must mesh its\nphases with arrivals of symbols from other computers. Even the best atomic\nclocks drift unforeseeably in frequency and phase; feedback steers them toward\naiming points that depend on a chosen wave function and on hypotheses about\nsignal propagation. A wave function, always under-determined by evidence,\nrequires a guess. Guessed wave functions are coded into computers that steer\natomic clocks in frequency and position---clocks that step computers through\ntheir phases of computations, as well as clocks, some on space vehicles, that\nsupply evidence of the propagation of signals. Recognizing the dependence of\nthe phasing of symbol arrivals on guesses about signal propagation elevates\n`logical synchronization.' from its practice in computer engineering to a\ndiscipline essential to physics. Within this discipline we begin to explore\nquestions invisible under any concept of time that fails to acknowledge the\nunforeseeable. In particular, variation of spacetime curvature is shown to\nlimit the bit rate of logical communication.\n", "  Physical and chemical transformation processes in reactive granular media\ninvolve the reorganization of the structure. In this paper, we study\nexperimentally the rearrangements of a two-dimensional (2D) granular packing\nundergoing a localized transformation. We track the position and evolution of\nall the disks that constitute the granular packing when either a large intruder\nshrinks in size or is pulled out of the granular structure. In the two\nsituations the displacements at long time are similar to 2D quasistatic silo\nflows whereas the short-time dynamic is heterogeneous in both space and time.\nWe observe an avalanchelike behavior with power-law distributed events\nuncorrelated in time. In addition, the instantaneous evolutions of the local\nsolid fraction exhibit self-similar distributions. The averages and the\nstandard deviations of the solid fraction variations can be rescaled,\nsuggesting a single mechanism of rearrangement.\n", "  In an abstract Hilbert space setting, we discuss many linear phenomena of\nmathematical physics. The functional analytic framework presented is used to\naddress continuous dependence of the solution operators\n$\\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{M})$ of certain (linear partial differential) equations\non the coefficients $\\mathcal{M}$. For this, we introduce a particular class of\ncoefficients $\\mathcal{M}$ and study the (nonlinear) mapping\n$\\mathcal{M}\\mapsto \\mathcal{S}(\\mathcal{M})$. We provide criteria that\nguarantee the continuity of $\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)$ under the norm, the strong,\nand the weak operator topology. We exemplify our findings in non-autonomous\nelectro-magnetic theory, thermodynamics and acoustics.\n", "  By using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, we show that extremely\ndiverse experimental data on flux-flow resistivity in multiband superconductors\ncan be qualitatively explained by a composite nature of Abrikosov vortices\nconsisting of elementary fractional vortices in different bands. In composite\nvortices, the ratio of a core size to electric field relaxation length is found\nto vary in wide limits depending on system parameters. As a result, the\nflux-flow magneto-resistance can strongly exceed the single-component\nBardeen-Stephen estimation provided that moving vortices generate electric\nfield stretching strongly outside the vortex cores.\n", "  Social interactions shape the patterns of spreading processes in a\npopulation. Techniques such as diaries or proximity sensors allow to collect\ndata about encounters and to build networks of contacts between individuals.\nThe contact networks obtained from these different techniques are however\nquantitatively different. Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect\nthe prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models\nof epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and\noverestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor\ndata determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the\ncorresponding simulations {with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial\nconditions}. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered\nfrom contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an\naccurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors\nrepresent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and\ndiaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the\npossibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a\nsurrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network\ngive the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact\nsensor network. We present and {compare} several methods to build such\nsurrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement\nbetween the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as\nthe contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data\ndescribing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.\n", "  Invisibility cloak capable of hiding an object can be achieved by properly\nmanipulating electromagnetic field. Such a remarkable ability has been shown in\ntransformation and ray optics. Alternatively, it may be realistic to create a\nspatial cloak by means of confining electromagnetic field in three-dimensional\narrayed waveguides and introducing appropriate collective curvature surrounding\nan object. We realize the artificial structure in borosilicate by femtosecond\nlaser direct writing, where we prototype up to 5000 waveguides to conceal\nmillimeter-scale volume. We characterize the performance of the cloak by\nnormalized cross correlation, tomography analysis and continuous\nthree-dimensional viewing angle scan. Our results show invisibility cloak can\nbe achieved in waveguide optics. Furthermore, directly printed invisibility\ncloak on a photonic chip may enable controllable study and novel applications\nin classical and quantum integrated photonics, such as invisualising a coupling\nor swapping operation with on-chip circuits of their own.\n", "  We discuss the current status of theoretical and experimental constraints on\nthe real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model. For the second neutral\n(non-standard) Higgs boson the mass range up to 1 TeV accessible at past and\ncurrent collider experiments is considered. We furthermore discuss electroweak\ncorrections to the H to hh partial decay width within this model.\n", "  We introduce a continuous family of frustration-free Hamiltonians with\nexactly solvable ground states. We prove that the {ground state of our model is\nnon-degenerate and exhibits} a novel quantum phase transition from bounded\nentanglement entropy to a massively entangled state with volume entropy\nscaling. The ground state may be interpreted as a deformation away from the\nuniform superposition of colored Motzkin paths, showed by Movassagh and Shor to\nhave a large (square-root) but sub-extensive scaling of entanglement into a\nstate with an extensive entropy.\n", "  The importance of graph search algorithm choice to the directed relation\ngraph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is studied by comparing basic and\nmodified depth-first search, basic and R-value-based breadth-first search\n(RBFS), and Dijkstra's algorithm. By using each algorithm with DRGEP to produce\nskeletal mechanisms from a detailed mechanism for n-heptane with\nrandomly-shuffled species order, it is demonstrated that only Dijkstra's\nalgorithm and RBFS produce results independent of species order. In addition,\neach algorithm is used with DRGEP to generate skeletal mechanisms for n-heptane\ncovering a comprehensive range of autoignition conditions for pressure,\ntemperature, and equivalence ratio. Dijkstra's algorithm combined with a\ncoefficient scaling approach is demonstrated to produce the most compact\nskeletal mechanism with a similar performance compared to larger skeletal\nmechanisms resulting from the other algorithms. The computational efficiency of\neach algorithm is also compared by applying the DRGEP method with each search\nalgorithm on the large detailed mechanism for n-alkanes covering n-octane to\nn-hexadecane with 2115 species and 8157 reactions. Dijkstra's algorithm\nimplemented with a binary heap priority queue is demonstrated as the most\nefficient method, with a CPU cost two orders of magnitude less than the other\nsearch algorithms.\n", "  We investigate theoretical and observational constraints on the mass-radius\nrelations for neutron stars. For that purpose we consider the model of neutron\nstars taking into considerations strong, weak, electromagnetic and\ngravitational interactions in the equation of state and integrate the structure\nequations within the Hartle-Thorne formalism for rotating configurations. On\nthe basis of the theoretical restrictions imposed by general relativity,\nmass-shedding and axisymmetric secular instabilities we calculate the upper and\nlower bounds for the parameters of neutron stars. Our theoretical calculations\nhave been compared and contrasted with the observational constraints and as a\nresult we show that the observational constraints favor stiff equations of\nstate.\n", "  In this paper we report on a Science Fair activity developed at Colegio Pedro\nII, a traditional Brazilian school, with a group of eight 8-12 years old\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) students. ADHD is usually a\ncondition associated with underachievement at school. As part of working toward\nscientific literacy for students, we explored the idea of conservation of\nenergy based on STS paradigm. At the same time, the learning experience was\ndesigned to stimulate children's poor executive function, or, more\nspecifically, their ability to manage time and planning future tasks.\n", "  The geometrical structures of singlet or triplet NCH3 molecules adsorbing on\nCu(110) surface with presence of Cu adatoms have been determined by\nfirst-principle calculation method. The two distinguishable structures match\nthe patterns of experimental scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) image,\nso-called zigzag and rectangle structures. The singlet NCH3 molecules arrange\nas zigzag, when the triplet NCH3 molecules array as rectangle. Since NCH3 can\nbe found in interstellar environment and its radicals are chemically active, we\narise a question whether this system can be utilized to study surface chemical\nreaction of interstellar medium (ISM). Therefore, the potential surface of NCH3\nisomerization to HNCH2 subsequently binding with CO on Cu(110) surface has been\ncalculated using density functional theory (DFT). The calculation results that\nHNCH2-CO can be produced on triplet state. However, the reaction is endothermic\nwhich is assumed to be occurred at warmer regions of solar systems or in\nspecific planets having terrestrial heat (like Earth).\n", "  The recent data from ATLAS and CMS hint at a new resonance at around 750 GeV\nin the diphoton invariant mass distribution. The explanation of the\nsignificantly large cross section for this diphoton resonance requires coloured\nparticles in its loop-induced production via gluon fusion and subsequent decay\nto diphoton. A natural candidate for the coloured particle is the\ncolour-triplet leptoquark, lying in the mass range 375-1000 GeV, which can\naccount for such large cross section. The leptoquarks in this mass range can\nalso be produced resonantly from neutrino and quark interactions at IceCube and\nprovide an explanation to the PeV-energy neutrino events. In this work, we show\nthat the scalar leptoquark with quantum number $(3,2,7/6)$ can uniquely provide\na unified explanation to both the PeV IceCube events and the 750 GeV diphoton\nresonance.\n", "  We study how the non-Fermi-liquid two-phase state reveals itself in transport\nproperties of high-mobility Si-MOSFETs. We have found features in zero-field\ntransport, magnetotransport, and thermodynamic spin magnetization in a 2D\ncorrelated electron system that may be directly related with the two-phase\nstate. The features manifest above a density dependent temperature $T^*$ that\nrepresents a novel high-energy scale, apart from the Fermi energy. More\nspecifically, in magnetoconductivity, we found a sharp onset of the novel\nregime $\\delta \\sigma(B,T) \\propto (B/T)^2$ above a density-dependent\ntemperature $T_{\\rm kink}(n)$, a high-energy behavior that \"mimics\" the\nlow-temperature diffusive interaction regime. The zero-field resistivity\ntemperature dependence exhibits an inflection point $T_{\\rm infl}(n)$. In\nthermodynamic magnetization, the weak-field spin susceptibility per electron,\n$\\partial \\chi /\\partial n$ changes sign at $T_{dM/dn}(n)$. All three notable\ntemperatures, $T_{\\rm kink}$, $T_{\\rm infl}$, and $T_{d M/ d n}$, behave\ncritically $\\propto (n-n_c)$, are close to each other, and are intrinsic to\nhigh-mobility samples solely, we therefore associate them with an energy scale\n$T^*$ caused by interactions in the 2DE system.\n", "  Many of the mathematical frameworks describing natural selection are\nequivalent to Bayes Theorem, also known as Bayesian updating. By definition, a\nprocess of Bayesian Inference is one which involves a Bayesian update, so we\nmay conclude that these frameworks describe natural selection as a process of\nBayesian inference. Thus natural selection serves as a counter example to a\nwidely-held interpretation that restricts Bayesian Inference to human mental\nprocesses (including the endeavors of statisticians). As Bayesian inference can\nalways be cast in terms of (variational) free energy minimization, natural\nselection can be viewed as comprising two components: a generative model of an\n\"experiment\" in the external world environment, and the results of that\n\"experiment\" or the \"surprise\" entailed by predicted and actual outcomes of the\n\"experiment\". Minimization of free energy implies that the implicit measure of\n\"surprise\" experienced serves to update the generative model in a Bayesian\nmanner. This description closely accords with the mechanisms of generalized\nDarwinian process proposed both by Dawkins, in terms of replicators and\nvehicles, and Campbell, in terms of inferential systems. Bayesian inference is\nan algorithm for the accumulation of evidence-based knowledge. This algorithm\nis now seen to operate over a wide range of evolutionary processes, including\nnatural selection, the evolution of mental models and cultural evolutionary\nprocesses, notably including science itself. The variational principle of free\nenergy minimization may thus serve as a unifying mathematical framework for\nuniversal Darwinism, the study of evolutionary processes operating throughout\nnature.\n", "  Recent large-scale infrared surveys have been revealing stellar populations\nin the inner Galaxy seen through strong interstellar extinction in the disk. In\nparticular, classical Cepheids with their period-luminosity and period-age\nrelations are useful tracers of Galactic structure and evolution. Interesting\ngroups of Cepheids reported recently include four Cepheids in the Nuclear\nStellar Disk (NSD), about 200 pc around the Galactic Centre, found by Matsunaga\net al. and those spread across the inner part of the disk reported by Dekany\nand collaborators. We here report our discovery of nearly thirty classical\nCepheids towards the bulge region, some of which are common with Dekany et al.,\nand discuss the large impact of the reddening correction on distance estimates\nfor these objects. Assuming that the four Cepheids in the NSD are located at\nthe distance of the Galactic Centre and that the near-infrared extinction law,\ni.e. wavelength dependency of the interstellar extinction, is not\nsystematically different between the NSD and other bulge lines-of-sight, most\nof the other Cepheids presented here are located significantly further than the\nGalactic Centre. This suggests a lack of Cepheids in the inner 2.5 kpc region\nof the Galactic disk except the NSD. Recent radio observations show a similar\ndistribution of star-forming regions.\n", "  Porous media are often modelled as systems of overlapping obstacles, which\nleads to the problem of two percolation thresholds in such systems, one for the\nporous matrix and the other one for the void space. Here we investigate these\npercolation thresholds in the model of overlapping squares or cubes of linear\nsize $k>1$ randomly distributed on a regular lattice. We find that the\npercolation threshold of obstacles is a nonmonotonic function of $k$, whereas\nthe percolation threshold of the void space is well approximated by a function\nlinear in $1/k$. We propose a generalization of the excluded volume\napproximation to discrete systems and use it to investigate the transition\nbetween continuous and discrete percolation, finding a remarkable agreement\nbetween the theory and numerical results. We argue that the continuous\npercolation threshold of aligned squares on a plane is the same for the solid\nand void phases and estimate the continuous percolation threshold of the void\nspace around aligned cubes in a 3D space as 0.036(1). We also discuss the\nconnection of the model to the standard site percolation with complex\nneighborhood.\n", "  The progression of time can be understood by assuming that the Hubble\nexpansion takes place in 4 dimensions rather than in 3. The flow of time\nconsists of the continuous creation of new moments, new nows, that accompany\nthe creation of new space. This model suggests a modification to the metric\ntensor of the vacuum that leads to testable consequences. Two cosmological\ntests are proposed, but they present both experimental and theoretical\nproblems. A more practical and immediate test is based on a predicted lag in\nthe emergence of gravitational radiation when two black holes merge. In such\nmergers (as recently observed by the LIGO team), a macroscopic volume (millions\nof cubic kilometers) of space is created in the region in which the\ngravitational wave is generated; this one-time creation of new space should be\naccompanied by the creation of detectable level of new time, resulting in a\ntime delay that could be observed as a growing lag in the emission of the wave\nas the merger takes place\n", "  Oftentimes observed divergence of numerical solutions to benchmark flows of\nthe UCM viscoelastic fluid is a known and widely discussed issue. Some authors\nconsider such singularities 'invincible'. Following the previous research, the\narticle gives more arguments against this position, for which it considers two\ntypical flows with a stagnation point, often a place of the flows' singularity.\nFor the flow spread over a wall, as previously for the counterflows, numerical\nand asymptotic analytical solutions are presented. Both kinds of flows turn out\nregular in the stagnation points, in particular, for high Weissenberg numbers.\nA good accordance is demonstrated between the analytical and numerical results.\n", "  High spin polarization materials or spin filters are key components in\nspintronics, a niche subfield of electronics where carrier spins play a\nfunctional role. Carrier transmission through these materials is \"spin\nselective\" i.e. these materials are able to discriminate between \"up\" and\n\"down\" spins. Common spin filters include transition metal ferromagnets and\ntheir alloys, with typical spin selectivity (or, polarization) ~50% or less.\nHere we consider carrier transport in an archetypical one-dimensional molecular\nhybrid in which a single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) is wrapped around by\nsingle stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA). By magnetoresistance\nmeasurements we show that this system can act as a spin filter with maximum\nspin polarization approaching ~74% at low temperatures, significantly larger\nthan transition metals under comparable conditions. Inversion asymmetric\nhelicoidal potential of the charged ssDNA backbone induces a Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction in the SWCNT channel and polarizes carrier spins. Our results are\nconsistent with recent theoretical work that predicted spin dependent\nconductance in ssDNA-SWCNT hybrid. Ability to generate highly spin polarized\ncarriers using molecular functionalization can lead to magnet-less and\ncontact-less spintronic devices in the future. This can eliminate the\nconductivity mismatch problem and open new directions for research in organic\nspintronics.\n", "  Heteroepitaxial structures based on Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$-type topological\ninsulators (TIs) exhibit exotic quantum phenomena. For optimal characterization\nof these phenomena, it is desirable to control the interface structure during\nfilm growth on such TIs. In this process, adatom mobility is a key factor. We\ndemonstrate that Pb mobility on the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$(111) surface can be\nmodified by the engineering local strain, {\\epsilon}, which is induced around\nthe point-like defects intrinsically forming in the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$(111) thin\nfilm grown on a Si(111)-7 $\\times$ 7 substrate. Scanning tunneling microscopy\nobservations of Pb adatom and cluster distributions and first-principles\ndensity functional theory (DFT) analyses of the adsorption energy and diffusion\nbarrier E$_{d}$ of Pb adatom on Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$(111) surface show a\nsignificant influence of {\\epsilon}. Surprisingly, E$_d$ reveals a cusp-like\ndependence on {\\epsilon} due to a bifurcation in the position of the stable\nadsorption site at the critical tensile strain {\\epsilon}$_{c}$ $ \\approx $\n0.8%. This constitutes a very different strain-dependence of diffusivity from\nall previous studies focusing on conventional metal or semiconductor surfaces.\nKinetic Monte Carlo simulations of Pb deposition, diffusion, and irreversible\naggregation incorporating the DFT results reveal adatom and cluster\ndistributions compatible with our experimental observations.\n", "  A new iron-oxychalcogenide (CaO)(FeSe) was obtained which crystallizes in the\northorhombic space group Pnma (No. 62) with a = 5.9180(12) {\\AA}, b = 3.8802(8)\n{\\AA}, c = 13.193(3) {\\AA}. The unique structure of (CaO)(FeSe) is built up of\na quasi-two-dimensional network of corrugated infinite layers of corner-shared\nFeSe2O2 tetrahedra that extend in the ab-plane. The corrugated layers composed\nof corner-shared FeSe2O2 tetrahedra stack along the c-axis with Ca2+ cations\nsandwiched between the layers. Optical spectroscopy and resistivity\nmeasurements reveal semiconducting behavior with an indirect optical band gap\nof around 1.8 eV and an activation energy of 0.19(1) eV. Electronic band\nstructure calculations at the density function level predict a magnetic\nconfiguration as ground state and confirm the presence of an indirect wide gap\nin (CaO)(FeSe).\n", "  The new bismuth chalcogenide La0.92Bi1.08S3 crystallizes in the monoclinic\nspace group C2/m with a = 28.0447(19) {\\AA}, b = 4.0722(2) {\\AA}, c =\n14.7350(9) {\\AA}, and $\\beta$ = 118.493(5){\\deg}. The structure of\nLa0.92Bi1.08S3 is built up of NaCl-type Bi2S5 blocks, and BiS4 and LaS5\ninfinitely long chains forming a compact three-dimensional framework with\nparallel tunnels. Optical spectroscopy and resistivity measurements reveal a\nsemiconducting behavior with a band gap of ~ 1 eV and activation energy for\ntransport of 0.36(1) eV. Thermopower measurements suggest the majority carriers\nof La0.92Bi1.08S3 are electrons. Heat capacity measurements indicate no phase\ntransitions from 2 to 300 K. Band structure calculations at the density\nfunctional theory level confirm the semiconducting nature and the indirect gap\nof La0.92Bi1.08S3.\n", "  The formation of quantum Hall channels inside the bulk of graphene is studied\nusing various contact and gate geometries. p-n junctions are created along the\nlongitudinal direction of samples, and enhanced conductance is observed in the\ncase of bipolar doping due to new conducting channels forming in the bulk,\nwhose position, propagating direction and, in one geometry, coupling to\nelectrodes are determined by the gate-controlled filling factor across the\ndevice. This effect could be exploited to probe the behavior and interaction of\nquantum Hall channels protected against uncontrolled scattering at the edges.\n", "  In this paper, the problem of synthesizing a general Hermitian quantum gate\ninto a set of primary quantum gates is addressed. To this end, an extended\nversion of the Jacobi approach for calculating the eigenvalues of Hermitian\nmatrices in linear algebra is considered as the basis of the proposed synthesis\nmethod. The quantum circuit synthesis method derived from the Jacobi approach\nand its optimization challenges are described. It is shown that the proposed\nmethod results in multiple-control rotation gates around the y axis,\nmultiple-control phase shift gates, multiple-control NOT gates and a middle\ndiagonal Hermitian matrix, which can be synthesized to multiple-control Pauli Z\ngates. Using the proposed approach, it is shown how multiple-control U gates,\nwhere U is a single-qubit Hermitian quantum gate, can be implemented using a\nlinear number of elementary gates in terms of circuit lines with the aid of one\nauxiliary qubit in an arbitrary state.\n", "  We report phase sensitive amplification in a 1.5mm long, $Ga_{0.5}In_{0.5}P$\ndispersion engineered photonic crystal waveguide which has a flattened\ndispersion profile. A signal degenerate configuration with pulsed pumps whose\ntotal peak power is only 0.5W yields a phase sensitive extinction ratio of\n10dB.\n", "  Bianchi models are posited by the BKL picture to be essential building blocks\ntowards an understanding of generic cosmological singularities. We study the\nbehaviour of spatially homogeneous anisotropic vacuum spacetimes of Bianchi\ntype VIII and IX, as they approach the big bang singularity. It is known since\n2001 that generic Bianchi IX spacetimes converge towards the so-called\nMixmaster attractor as time goes towards the singularity. We extend this result\nto the case of Bianchi VIII vacuum. The BKL picture suggests that particle\nhorizons should form, i.e. spatially separate regions should causally decouple.\nWe prove that this decoupling indeed occurs, for Lebesgue almost every Bianchi\nVIII and IX vacuum spacetime.\n", "  The proposed algorithm by Philippe D'Arco et al. 2013 J. Phys.: Condens.\nMatter 25 355401 was not well compared with other possible solutions for\nsymmetry independent configuration (SIC) generation. In this comment, three\nwell known solutions of SIC searching are discussed: exhaustive explorations,\npure random sampling and \"symmetry imposed\" approaches. It is shown, that the\nadvantages of the algorithm published by Philippe D'Arco et al. are\nquestionable.\n", "  In this paper, we use the model dependent method to revisit the constraint on\nthe well-known cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR). By using the latest\nSNIa samples, such as Union2.1, JLA and SNLS, we find that the SNIa data alone\ncan not constrain the cosmic opacity parameter $\\varepsilon$, which denotes the\ndeviation from the CDDR, $d_{\\rm L} = d_{\\rm A}(1+z)^{2+\\varepsilon}$, very\nwell. The constraining power on $\\varepsilon$ from the luminosity distance\nindicator provided by SNIa and GRB is hardly to be improved at present. When we\ninclude other cosmological observations, such as the measurements of Hubble\nparameter, the baryon acoustic oscillations and the distance information from\ncosmic microwave background, we obtain the tightest constraint on the cosmic\nopacity parameter $\\varepsilon$, namely the 68\\% C.L. limit:\n$\\varepsilon=0.023\\pm0.018$. Furthermore, we also consider the evolution of\n$\\varepsilon$ as a function of $z$ using two methods, the parametrization and\nthe principle component analysis, and do not find the evidence for the\ndeviation from zero. Finally, we simulate the future SNIa and Hubble\nmeasurements and find the mock data could give very tight constraint on the\ncosmic opacity $\\varepsilon$ and verify the CDDR at high significance.\n", "  The Sn substituted Ni-Zn ferrites were synthesized by the standard double\nsintering technique using nano powders of nickel oxide (NiO), zinc oxide (ZnO),\niron oxide (Fe2O3) and tin oxide (SnO2). The structural and electrical\nproperties have been investigated by the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron\nmicroscopy, DC resistivity and dielectric measurements. Extra intermediate\nphase has been detected along with the inverse cubic spinel phase of Ni-Zn\nferrite. Enhancement of grain size is observed in Sn substituted Ni-Zn\nferrites. DC resistivity as a function of temperature has been investigated by\ntwo probe method. The DC resistivity was found to decrease whereas the\ndielectric constants increase with increasing Sn content in Ni-Zn ferrites. The\ndielectric constant of the as prepared samples is high enough to use these\nmaterials in miniaturized memory devices based capacitive components or energy\nstorage principles.\n", "  The design of a 1 micrometer gate length depletion-mode InSb quantum-well\nfield-effect transistor (QWFET) with a 10 nm-thick Al2O3 gate dielectric has\nbeen optimized using a quantum corrected self-consistent Schrodinger-Poisson\n(QCSP) and two dimensional drift-diffusion model. The model predicts a very\nhigh electron mobility of 4.42 m2V-1s-1 at Vg= 0V, a small pinch off gate\nvoltage (Vp) of -0.25V, a maximum extrinsic transconductance (gm) of 4.94 S/mm\nand a drain current density of more than 6.04 A/mm. A short-circuit\ncurrent-gain cut-off frequency (fT) of 374 GHz and a maximum oscillation\nfrequency (fmax) of 645 GHz are predicted for the device. These characteristics\nmake the device a potential candidate for low power, high-speed logic\nelectronic device applications.\n", "  Entanglement and mixedness of a bipartite mixed state resource are crucial\nfor the success of quantum teleportation. Upper bounds on measures of\nmixedness, namely, von Neumann entropy and linear entropy beyond which the\nbipartite state ceases to be useful for quantum teleportation are known in the\nliterature. In this work, we generalize these bounds and obtain rank dependent\nupper bounds on von Nuemann entropy and linear entropy for an arbitrary\nbipartite mixed state resource. We observe that the upper bounds on measures of\nmixedness increase with increase in the rank. For two qubit mixed states, we\nobtain rank dependent lower bound on the concurrence, a measure of\nentanglement, below which the state is useless for quantum teleportation.\nWerner state, which is a fourth rank state, exhibits the theoretical upper\nbound on mixedness among two qubit mixed states. We construct Werner like\nstates of lower ranks and show that these states possess the theoretical rank\ndependent upper bounds obtained on the measures of mixedness and theoretical\nrank dependent lower bounds on the concurrence.\n", "  People's behavior on online social networks, which store geo-tagged\ninformation showing where people were or are at the moment, can provide\ninformation about their offline life as well. In this paper we present one\npossible research direction that can be taken using Flickr dataset of publicly\navailable geo-tagged media objects (e.g., photographs, videos). Namely, our\nfocus is on investigating attractiveness of countries or smaller large-scale\ncomposite regions (e.g., US states) for foreign visitors where attractiveness\nis defined as the absolute number of media objects taken in a certain state or\ncountry by its foreign visitors compared to its population size. We also\nconsider it together with attractiveness of the destination for the\ninternational migration, measured through publicly available dataset provided\nby United Nations. By having those two datasets, we are able to look at\nattractiveness from two different perspectives: short-term and long-term one.\nAs our previous study showed that city attractiveness for Spanish cities\nfollows a superlinear trend, here we want to see if the same law is also\napplicable to country/state (i.e., composite regions) attractiveness. Finally,\nwe provide one possible explanation for the obtained results.\n", "  We investigate the effect of controlled annealing on the structural and\nelectronic phase evolution of Tin dioxide from Tin (II) oxyhydroxide prepared\nby simple precipitation method. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests a complex\nweight loss-gain process involved, passing through an intermediate phase of tin\noxide nanoparticles. The probable structural and electronic phase evolution is\ndiscussed using detailed X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\ninvestigations.\n", "  We present the results of our investigation, using a Chandra X-ray\nobservation, into the stellar population of the massive star formation region\nG5.89-0.39, and its potential connection to the coincident TeV gamma-ray source\nHESSJ1800-240B. G5.89-0.39 comprises two separate HII regions G5.89-0.39A and\nG5.89-0.39B (an ultra-compact HII region). We identified 159 individual X-ray\npoint sources in our observation using the source detection algorithm\n\\texttt{wavdetect}. 35 X-ray sources are associated with the HII complex\nG5.89-0.39. The 35 X-ray sources represent an average unabsorbed luminosity\n(0.3-10\\,keV) of $\\sim10^{30.5}$\\,erg/s, typical of B7-B5 type stars. The\npotential ionising source of G5.89-0.39B known as Feldt's star is possibly\nidentified in our observation with an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity suggestive of\na B7-B5 star. The stacked energy spectra of these sources is well-fitted with a\nsingle thermal plasma APEC model with kT$\\sim$5\\,keV, and column density\nN$_{\\rm H}=2.6\\times10^{22}$\\,cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\\rm V}\\sim 10$). The residual\n(source-subtracted) X-ray emission towards G5.89-0.39A and B is about 30\\% and\n25\\% larger than their respective stacked source luminosities. Assuming this\nresidual emission is from unresolved stellar sources, the total\nB-type-equivalent stellar content in G5.89-0.39A and B would be 75 stars,\nconsistent with an earlier estimate of the total stellar mass of hot stars in\nG5.89-0.39. We have also looked at the variability of the 35 X-ray sources in\nG5.89-0.39. Ten of these sources are flagged as being variable. Further studies\nare needed to determine the exact causes of the variability, however the\nvariability could point towards pre-main sequence stars. Such a stellar\npopulation could provide sufficient kinetic energy to account for a part of the\nGeV to TeV gamma-ray emission in the source HESSJ1800-240B.\n", "  This paper studies first the differential inequalities that make it possible\nto build a global theory of pseudo-holomorphic functions in the case of one or\nseveral complex variables. In the case of one complex dimension, we prove that\nthe differential inequalities describing pseudo-holomorphic functions can be\nused to define a one-real-dimensional manifold (by the vanishing of a function\nwith nonzero gradient), which is here a 1-parameter family of plane curves. On\nstudying the associated envelopes, such a parameter can be eliminated by\nsolving two nonlinear partial differential equations. The classical\ndifferential geometry of curves can be therefore exploited to get a novel\nperspective on the equations describing the global theory of pseudo-holomorphic\nfunctions.\n", "  High-spin states in $^{84}$Rb are studied by using the $^{70}$Zn($^{18}$O,\np3n)$^{84}$Rb reaction at beam energy of 75 MeV. Three high-lying\nnegative-parity bands are established, whose level spacings are very regular,\ni.e., there don't exist signature splitting. The dipole character of the\ntransitions of these three bands is assigned by the $\\gamma$-$\\gamma$\ndirectional correlations of oriented states (DCO) intensity ratios and the\nmultipolarity M1 is suggested by the analogy to multiparticle excitations in\nneighboring nuclei. The strong M1 and weak or no E2 transitions are observed.\nAll these characteristic features show they are magnetic rotation bands.\n", "  By keeping nonlinear Boltzmann factor in electron density dependence on\nelectrostatic potential it is demonstrated that large plasma density blobs,\noften seen in experiment inside separatrix, can exist within the framework of\ndrift wave dynamics. The estimates show that plasma density in a blob can be ~3\ntimes higher that average plasma density, but hardly exceeds this limit, which\nin a ball park is in agreement with experimental observations.\n", "  We comment on the recent Letter by Xu and Wang et al. [Opt. Lett. 41, 2430\n(2016)] in which an approach of quantitative phase extraction in\ndual-wavelength in-line phase-shifting interferometry (DWILPSI) was proposed.\nIt is noted that a special phase shift is used, which more or less embarrasses\nits practical operation. We wish to show that the same result can also be\nreached by combining the generalized phase-shifting algorithm and the\nleast-square algorithm, in which the phase shift can be chosen randomly. In\naddition to maintaining high accuracy and rapid processing speed of the DWILPSI\nmethod, the proposed method greatly facilitates its application in actual\nmeasurement.\n", "  We reported the basal-plane thermal conductivity in exfoliated bilayer\nhexagonal boron nitride h-BN that was measured using suspended prepatterned\nmicrostructures. The h-BN sample suitable for thermal measurements was\nfabricated by dry-transfer method, whose sample quality, due to less polymer\nresidues on surfaces, is believed to be superior to that of PMMA-mediated\nsamples. The measured room temperature thermal conductivity is around 484\nWm-1K-1(+141 Wm-1K-1/ -24 Wm-1K-1) which exceeds that in bulk h-BN, providing\nexperimental observation of the thickness-dependent thermal conductivity in\nsuspended few-layer h-BN.\n", "  A new, high-order slope-limiting procedure for the Piecewise Parabolic Method\n(PPM) and the Piecewise Quartic Method (PQM) is described. Following a Weighted\nEssentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO)-type paradigm, the proposed slope-limiter\nseeks to reconstruct smooth, non-oscillatory piecewise polynomial profiles as a\nnon-linear combination of the natural and monotone-limited PPM and PQM\ninterpolants. Compared to existing monotone slope-limiting techniques, this new\nstrategy is designed to improve accuracy at smooth extrema, while controlling\nspurious oscillations in the neighbourhood of sharp features. Using the new\nslope-limited PPM and PQM interpolants, a high-order accurate\nArbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian framework for advection-dominated flows is\nconstructed, and its effectiveness is examined using a series of one- and\ntwo-dimensional benchmark cases. It is shown that the new WENO-type\nslope-limiting techniques offer a significant improvement in accuracy compared\nto existing strategies, allowing the PPM- and PQM- based schemes to achieve\nfully third- and fifth-order accurate convergence, respectively, for\nsufficiently smooth problems.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is planned to be the next generation\nground based observatory for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy.\nGamma-rays provide a powerful insight into the non-thermal universe and\nhopefully a unique probe for new physics. Imaging Cherenkov telescopes have\nalready discovered more than 170 VHE gamma-ray emitters providing plentiful of\nvaluable data and clearly demonstrating the power of this technique. In spite\nof the impressive results there are indications that the known sources\nrepresent only the tip of the iceberg. A major step in sensitivity is needed to\nincrease the number of detected sources, observe short time-scale variability\nand improve morphological studies of extended sources. An extended energy\ncoverage is advisable to observe far-away extragalactic objects and improve\nspectral analysis. CTA aims to increase the sensitivity by an order of\nmagnitude compared to current facilities, to extend the accessible gamma-ray\nenergies from a few tens of GeV to a hundred of TeV, and to improve on other\nparameters like angular and energy resolution. CTA will provide moreover a full\nsky-coverage by featuring an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\nin both hemispheres. This paper presents an overview of the technical design\nand summarize the current status of the project. CTA prospects for some key\nscience topics like the origin of relativistic cosmic particles, the\nacceleration mechanisms in extreme environments such as neutron stars and black\nholes and searches for Dark Matter are discussed.\n", "  Geometric frustration effects were studied systematically with the Ising\nantiferromagnet on the 11 Archimedean lattices using the Monte-Carlo methods.\nThe Wang-Landau algorithm for static properties (specific heat and residual\nentropy) and the Metropolis algorithm for a freezing order parameter were\nadopted. The exact residual entropy was also found. Based on the degree of\nfrustration and dynamic properties, ground states of them were determined. The\nShastry-Sutherland lattice and the trellis lattice are weakly-frustrated and\nhave two-dimensional and one-dimensional long-range-ordered ground states,\nrespectively. The bounce, maple-leaf, and star lattices have the spin ice\nphase. The spin liquid phase appears in the triangular and kagom\\'e lattices.\n", "  Mountain echoes are a well-known phenomenon, where an impulse excitation is\nmirrored by the rocks to generate a replica of the original stimulus, often\nwith reverberating recurrences. For spin echoes in magnetic resonance and\nphoton echoes in atomic and molecular systems the role of the mirror is played\nby a second, time delayed pulse which is able to reverse the ow of time and\nrecreate the original event. Recently, laser-induced rotational alignment and\norientation echoes were introduced for molecular gases, and discussed in terms\nof rotational-phase-space filamentation. Here we present, for the first time, a\ndirect spatiotemporal analysis of various molecular alignment echoes by means\nof coincidence Coulomb explosion imaging. We observe hitherto unreported\nspatially rotated echoes, that depend on the polarization direction of the pump\npulses, and find surprising imaginary echoes at negative times.\n", "  We consider the electron transport in the Datta-Das spin transistor within\nthe two-subband model taking into account the intra- and inter-subband\nspin-orbit (SO) interaction and study the influence of the inter-subband SO\ncoupling on the spin-transistor operation. Starting from the model, in which\nthe SO coupling constants are treated as parameters, we show that the\ninter-subband SO interaction strongly affects the ordinary conductance\noscillations predicted for the transistor with the single occupancy.\nInterestingly, we find that even in the absence of the intra-subband SO\ninteraction, the conductance oscillates as a function of the inter-subband SO\ncoupling constant. This phenomenon is explained as resulting from the\ninter-subband transition with spin-flip. Next, we consider the realistic spin\ntransistor model based on the gated\nAl$_{0.48}$In$_{0.52}$As/Ga$_{0.47}$In$_{0.53}$As double quantum well, for\nwhich the SO coupling constants are determined by the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Poisson\napproach. We show that the SO coupling constants rapidly change around $V_g=0$,\nwhich is desirable for the spin transistor operation. We demonstrate that for\nhigh electron densities the inter-subband SO interaction starts to play the\ndominant role. The strong evidence of this interaction is the reduction of the\nconductance for gate voltage $V_g=0$, which leads to the reduction of the\non/off conductance ratio.\n", "  Cavities in linear accelerators suffer from eigenfrequency shifts due to\nmechanical deformation caused by the electromagnetic radiation pressure, a\nphenomenon known as Lorentz detuning. Estimating the frequency shift up to the\nneeded accuracy by means of standard Finite Element Methods, is a complex task\ndue to the non exact representation of the geometry and due to the necessity\nfor mesh refinement when using low order basis functions. In this paper, we use\nIsogeometric Analysis for discretising both mechanical deformations and\nelectromagnetic fields in a coupled multiphysics simulation approach. The\ncombined high-order approximation of both leads to high accuracies at a\nsubstantially lower computational cost.\n", "  The Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac--Coulomb Green function\n[R.\\/~Szmytkowski, J.\\ Phys.\\ B \\textbf{30}, 825 (1997); \\textbf{30}, 2747(E)\n(1997)] is exploited to derive a closed-form expression for the magnetizability\nof the relativistic one-electron atom in an arbitrary discrete state, with a\npoint-like, spinless and motionless nucleus of charge $Ze$. The result has the\nform of a double finite sum involving the generalized hypergeometric functions\n${}_3F_2$ of the unit argument. Our general expression agrees with formulas\nobtained analytically earlier by other authors for some particular states of\nthe atom. We present also numerical values of the magnetizability for some\nexcited states of selected hydrogenlike ions with $1 \\leqslant Z \\leqslant 137$\nand compare them with data available in the literature.\n", "  Chemically active colloids generate changes in the chemical composition of\ntheir surrounding solution and thereby induce flows in the ambient fluid which\naffect their dynamical evolution. Here we study the many-body dynamics of a\nmonolayer of active particles trapped at a fluid-fluid interface. To this end\nwe consider a mean-field model which incorporates the direct pair interaction\n(including also the capillary interaction which is caused specifically by the\ninterfacial trapping) as well as the effect of hydrodynamic interactions\n(including the Marangoni flow induced by the response of the interface to the\nchemical activity). The values of the relevant physical parameters for typical\nexperimental realizations of such systems are estimated and various scenarios,\nwhich are predicted by our approach for the dynamics of the monolayer, are\ndiscussed. In particular, we show that the chemically-induced Marangoni flow\ncan prevent the clustering instability driven by the capillary attraction.\n", "  On highly oxygen deficient thin films of hafnium oxide (hafnia, HfO$_{2-x}$)\ncontaminated with adsorbates of carbon oxides, the formation of hafnium carbide\n(HfC$_x$) at the surface during vacuum annealing at temperatures as low as 600\n{\\deg}C is reported. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy the evolution of\nthe HfC$_x$ surface layer related to a transformation from insulating into\nmetallic state is monitored in situ. In contrast, for fully stoichiometric\nHfO$_2$ thin films prepared and measured under identical conditions, the\nformation of HfC$_x$ was not detectable suggesting that the enhanced adsorption\nof carbon oxides on oxygen deficient films provides a carbon source for the\ncarbide formation. This shows that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in\ncarbon contaminated hafnia lowers considerably the formation energy of hafnium\ncarbide. Thus, the presence of a sufficient amount of residual carbon in\nresistive random access memory devices might lead to a similar carbide\nformation within the conducting filaments due to Joule heating.\n", "  Ionoluminescence (IL) and photoluminescence (PL) of trivalent erbium ions\n(Er3+) in Gd2O3 nanopowder host activated with Bi3+ ions has been studied in\norder to establish the link between changes in luminescent spectra and\ntemperature of the sample material. IL measurements have been performed with\nH2+ 100 keV ion beam bombarding the target material for a few seconds, while PL\nspectra have been collected for temperatures ranging from 20 to 700{\\deg}C. The\nPL data was used as a reference in determining the temperature corresponding to\nIL spectra. The collected data enabled the definition of empirical formula\nbased on the Boltzmann distribution, which allows the temperature to be\ndetermined with a maximum sensitivity of 9.7 x 10-3 {\\deg}C-1. The analysis of\nthe Er3+ energy level structure in terms of tendency of the system to stay in\nthermal equilibrium, explained different behaviors of the lines intensities.\nThis work led to the conclusion that temperature changes during ion excitation\ncan be easily defined with separately collected PL spectra. The final result,\nwhich is empirical formula describing dependence of fluorescence intensity\nratio on temperature, raises the idea of an application of method in\ntemperature control, during processes like ion implantation and some nuclear\napplications.\n", "  The interpretation of LHC measurements requires a careful estimate of various\nsources of uncertainties that affect theoretical calculations. In this\ncontribution, we present the PDF4LHC Working Group recommendations for the\nusage of sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs) at the LHC Run II. We\nreview the construction and validation of the PDF4LHC15 combined sets, and\nstudy some of their phenomenological implications. We also address some recent\ncriticism of these recommendations.\n", "  We report a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on\ntopological insulator (TI) TlBi1-xSbxTe2 which is bulk insulating at 0.5 < x <\n0.9 and undergoes a metal-insulator-metal transition with the Sb content x. We\nfound that this transition is characterized by a systematic hole doping with\nincreasing x, which results in the Fermi-level crossings of the bulk conduction\nand valence bands at x~ 0 and x~1, respectively. The Dirac point of the\ntopological surface state is gradually isolated from the valence-band edge,\naccompanied by a sign reversal of Dirac carriers. We also found that the Dirac\nvelocity is the largest among known solid-solution TI systems. The\nTlBi1-xSbxTe2 system thus provides an excellent platform for Dirac-cone\nengineering and device applications of TIs.\n", "  We have performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on Tl0.5Bi2Te3, a\npossible topological superconductor derived from Bi2Te3. We found that the bulk\nFermi surface consists of multiple three-dimensional hole pockets surrounding\nthe Z point, produced by the direct hole doping into the valence band. The\nDirac-cone surface state is well isolated from the bulk bands, and the surface\nchemical potential is variable in the entire band-gap range. Tl0.5Bi2Te3 thus\nprovides an excellent platform to realize two-dimensional topological\nsuperconductivity through a proximity effect from the superconducting bulk.\nAlso, the observed Fermi-surface topology provides a concrete basis for\nconstructing theoretical models for bulk topological superconductivity in\nhole-doped topological insulators.\n", "  We show how single system steering can be exhibited by classical light, a\nfeature originating from superposition in classical optics that also enables\nentanglement and Bell-violation by classical light beams. Single system\nsteering is the temporal analogue of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering in\nthe quantum domain, enabling control of the state of a remote system, and can\nhence be connected to the security of secret key generation between two remote\nparties. We derive the steering criterion for a single mode coherent state when\ndisplaced parity measurements are performed at two different times. The\nsecurity bound of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol under the gaussian\ncloning attack is calculated to yield an, in principle, ideal and quantum-like\nkey rate using a fine-grained uncertainty relation corresponding to the\nclassical phase space.\n", "  The increase of the centre-of-mass energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nto 13 TeV has opened up a new energy regime. Final states including\nhigh-momentum multi-jet signatures often dominate beyond standard model\nphenomena, in particular decay products of new heavy particles. While the\npotential di-photon resonance currently receives a lot of attention, multi-jet\nfinal states pose strong constraints on what physics model an observation could\nactually be described with. In this presentation, the latest results of the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations in high transverse momentum multi-jet final states\nare summarised. This includes searches for heavy resonances and new phenomena\nin the di-jet mass spectrum, di-jet angular distributions, and the sum of\ntransverse momenta in different event topologies. Furthermore, results on\nleptoquark pair production will be shown. A particular focus is laid on the\ndifferent background estimation methods.\n", "  We present a low energy Hamiltonian generalized to describe how the energy\nbands of germanene ($\\rm \\overline{Ge}$) are modified by interaction with a\nsubstrate or a capping layer. The parameters that enter the Hamiltonian are\ndetermined from first-principles relativistic calculations for $\\rm\n\\overline{Ge}|$MoS$_2$ bilayers and MoS$_2|\\rm \\overline{Ge} |$MoS$_2$\ntrilayers and are used to determine the topological nature of the system. For\nthe lowest energy, buckled germanene structure, the gap depends strongly on how\ngermanene is oriented with respect to the MoS$_2$ layer(s). Topologically\nnon-trivial gaps for bilayers and trilayers can be almost as large as for a\nfree-standing germanene layer.\n", "  The quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect in the DC regime, which has been\nintensively researched, relies on the existence of symmetry-protected edge\nstates. Here, we demonstrate that a QSH system behaves quite differently in\nresponse to an applied AC electric field, and put forward the idea of AC QSH\neffect. The AC QSH effect can occur in the bulk without involving the fragile\nedge states, hence being robust against time-reversal symmetry breaking and\ndisorder. It lays a more solid foundation for practical applications of the\ntwo-dimensional topological insulators, in the emerging field of AC\nspintronics.\n", "  In developing strategies of manipulating surface electromagnetic waves, it\nhas been recently recognized that a complete forbidden band gap can exist in a\nperiodic surface-wave photonic crystal, which has subsequently produced various\nsurface-wave photonic devices. However, it is not obvious whether such a\nconcept can be extended to a non-periodic surface-wave system that lacks\ntranslational symmetry. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a surface-wave\nphotonic quasicrystal that lacks periodicity can also exhibit a forbidden band\ngap for surface electromagnetic waves. The lower cutoff of this forbidden band\ngap is mainly determined by the maximum separation between nearest neighboring\npillars. Point defects within this band gap show distinct properties compared\nto a periodic photonic crystal for the absence of translational symmetry. A\nline-defect waveguide, which is crafted out of this surface-wave photonic\nquasicrystal by shortening a random row of metallic rods, is also demonstrated\nto guide and bend surface waves around sharp corners along an irregular\nwaveguiding path.\n", "  Strong discontinuities in solutions of the gas dynamic equations under\nisentropic conditions, i.e., with continuity of entropy at the discontinuity,\nare examined. Solutions for a standard shock wave with continuity of energy at\nthe discontinuity are compared with those for an isentropic 'shock wave'. It is\nshown that numerical simulation of astrophysical problems in which\nhigh-amplitude shock waves are encountered (supernova explosions, modelling of\njets) with conservation of entropy, rather than of energy, leads to large\nerrors in the shock calculations. The isentropic equations of gas dynamics can\nbe used only when there are no strong discontinuities in the solution or when\nthe intensity of the shocks is not high and they do not significantly affect\nthe flow.\n", "  This paper investigates thin-shell wormholes in Born-Infeld theory supported\nby generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG). We study their stability via radial\nperturbations for distinct values of charge and Born-Infeld parameter. The\ncomparison of wormhole solutions corresponding to generalized Chaplygin gas,\nmodified Chaplygin gas with GCCG quation of state is established. It is found\nthat similar type of wormhole solutions exists for small value of charge and\nBorn-Infeld parameter for all type of equation of state, while some extra\nstable as well as unstable solution are found corresponding to large value of\ncharge and Born-Infeld parameter. Thus, it is concluded that GCCG and large\nvalue of charge may responsible for such extra solutions.\n", "  To better understand the flows of ideas or information through social and\nbiological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in\nnetwork flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless\nfirst-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced\nhigher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step\npathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively\nrevealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov\nchain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter\nspaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore\nmake mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this\nproblem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on\nnetwork flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we\npresent a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in\nmultidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science\nof science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because\nthe map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.\n", "  We present a systematic way of derivation of the algebraic curves of\nseparation of variables for the classical Kovalevskaya top and its\ngeneralizations, starting from the spectral curve of the corresponding Lax\nrepresentation found by Reyman and Semonov-Tian-Shansky.\n  In particular, we show how the known Kovalevskaya curve of separation can be\nobtained, by a simple one-step transformation, from the spectral curve.\n  The algorithm works for the general constants of motion of the system and is\nbased on W. Barth's description of Prym varieties via pencils of genus 3\ncurves. It also allows us to derive new curves of separation of variables in\nvarious generalizations of this system.\n", "  We establish a simple method to assess the quantum Fisher information\nrequired for resolving two incoherent point sources with an imaging system. The\nresulting Cram\\'er-Rao bound shows that the standard Rayleigh limit can be\nsurpassed by suitable coherent measurements. We explicitly find these optimal\nstrategies and present a realization for Gaussian and slit apertures. This\ninvolves a projection onto the optimal bases that is accomplished with digital\nholographic techniques and is compared with a CCD position measurement. Our\nexperimental results unequivocally confirm unprecedented sub-Rayleigh\nprecision.\n", "  We examine the current state-of-the-art in nonperturbative calculations done\nwith Hamiltonians constructed in light-front quantization of various field\ntheories. The language of light-front quantization is introduced, and important\n(numerical) techniques, such as Pauli--Villars regularization, discrete\nlight-cone quantization, basis light-front quantization, the light-front\ncoupled-cluster method, the renormalization group procedure for effective\nparticles, sector-dependent renormalization, and the Lanczos diagonalization\nmethod, are surveyed. Specific applications are discussed for quenched scalar\nYukawa theory, $\\phi^4$ theory, ordinary Yukawa theory, supersymmetric\nYang--Mills theory, quantum electrodynamics, and quantum chromodynamics. The\ncontent should serve as an introduction to these methods for anyone interested\nin doing such calculations and as a rallying point for those who wish to solve\nquantum chromodynamics in terms of wave functions rather than random samplings\nof Euclidean field configurations.\n", "  In this paper, we employ evolutionary algorithm along with the full-potential\ndensity functional theory (DFT) computations to perform a comprehensive search\nfor the stable structures of stoichiometric (WS2)n nano-clusters (n=1-9),\nwithin three different exchange-correlation functionals. Our results suggest\nthat n=3, 5, 8 are possible candidates for the low temperature magic sizes of\nWS2 nano-clusters while at temperatures above 600 Kelvin, n=5 and 7 exhibit\nhigher relative stability among the studied systems. The electronic properties\nand energy gap of the lowest energy isomers were computed within several\nschemes, including semilocal PBE and BLYP functionals, hybrid B3LYP functional,\nmany body based DFT+GW approach, and time dependent DFT calculations.\nVibrational spectra of the lowest lying isomers, computed by the force constant\nmethod, are used to address IR spectra and thermal free energy of the clusters.\nTime dependent density functional calculation in real time domain is applied to\ndetermine the full absorption spectra and optical gap of the lowest energy\nisomers of the WS2 nano-clusters.\n", "  Two-dimensional Hubbard model is very important in condensed matter physics.\nHowever it has not been resolved though it has been proposed for more than 50\nyears. We give several methods to construct eigenstates of the model that are\nindependent of the on-site interaction strength $U$.\n", "  Memristive nanodevices offer new frontiers for computing systems that unite\narithmetic and memory operations on-chip. Here, we explore the integration of\nelectrochemical metallization cell (ECM) nanodevices with tunable filamentary\nswitching in nanoscale learning systems. Such devices offer a natural\ntransition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP).\nIn this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve\nnoisy classification tasks. A single crossbar learning scheme is first\nintroduced and evaluated. Perfect classification is possible only for simple\ninput patterns, within critical timing parameters, and when device variability\nis weak. To overcome these limitations, a dual-crossbar learning system partly\ninspired by the extreme learning machine (ELM) approach is then introduced.\nThis approach outperforms a conventional ELM-inspired system when the first\nlayer is imprinted before training and testing, and especially so when\nvariability in device timing evolution is considered: variability is therefore\ntransformed from an issue to a feature. In attempting to classify the MNIST\ndatabase under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84%\nclassification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88%\nclassification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92%\nclassification. We discuss benefits and drawbacks of both systems in terms of\nenergy, complexity, area imprint, and speed. All these results highlight that\ntuning and exploiting intrinsic device timing parameters may be of central\ninterest to future bio-inspired approximate computing systems.\n", "  A profound quest of statistical mechanics is the origin of irreversibility -\nthe arrow of time. New stimulants have been provided, thanks to unprecedented\ndegree of control reached in experiments with isolated quantum systems and\nrapid theoretical developments of manybody localization in disordered\ninteracting systems. The proposal of (many-body) eigenstate thermalization (ET)\nfor these systems reinforces the common belief that either interaction or\nextrinsic randomness is required for thermalization. Here, we unveil a quantum\nthermalization mechanism challenging this belief. We find that, provided\none-body quantum chaos is present, as a pure many-body state evolves the arrow\nof time can emerge, even without interaction or randomness. In times much\nlarger than the Ehrenfest time that signals the breakdown of quantum-classical\ncorrespondence, quantum chaotic motion leads to thermal [Fermi-Dirac (FD) or\nBose-Einstein (BE)] distributions and thermodynamics in individual eigenstates.\nOur findings lay dynamical foundation of statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics of isolated quantum systems.\n", "  The exact solutions of the complete (1+3)-dimensional Dirac equation of\nfermions moving in ideal Aharonov-Bohm (AB) rings and cylinders are used for\nderiving the exact expressions of the relativistic partial currents. It is\nshown that these currents can be related to the derivative of the fermion\nenergy with respect to the flux parameter, just as in the non-relativistic\ncase. However, a new and remarkable relativistic effect is the saturation of\nthe partial currents for high values of the total angular momentum. Based on\nthis property, the total relativistic persistent currents at $T=0$ is evaluated\nfor rings and cylinders obtaining approximative simple closed formulas.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum communication enable the secure\nexchange of information between remote parties. Currently, the\ndistributed-phase-reference (DPR) protocols, which are based on weak coherent\npulses, are among the most practical solutions for long-range QKD. During the\nlast 10 years, long-distance fiber-based DPR systems have been successfully\ndemonstrated, although fundamental obstacles such as intrinsic channel losses\nlimit their performance. Here, we introduce the first two-dimensional DPR-QKD\nprotocol in which information is encoded in the time and phase of weak coherent\npulses. The ability of extracting two bits of information per detection event,\nenables a higher secret key rate in specific realistic network scenarios.\nMoreover, despite the use of more dimensions, the proposed protocol remains\nsimple, practical, and fully integrable.\n", "  Rolling tachyon field models are among the candidates suggested as\nexplanations for the recent acceleration of the Universe. In these models the\nfield is expected to interact with gauge fields and lead to variations of the\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$. Here we take advantage of recent\nobservational progress and use a combination of background cosmological\nobservations of Type Ia supernovas and astrophysical and local measurements of\n$\\alpha$ to improve constraints on this class of models. We show that the\nconstraints on $\\alpha$ imply that the field dynamics must be extremely slow,\nleading to a constraint of the present-day dark energy equation of state\n$(1+w_0)<2.4\\times10^{-7}$ at the $99.7\\%$ confidence level. Therefore current\nand forthcoming standard background cosmology observational probes can't\ndistinguish this class of models from a cosmological constant, while detections\nof $\\alpha$ variations could possibly do so since they would have a\ncharacteristic redshift dependence.\n", "  Plasmonic optical tweezers are a ubiquitous tool for the precise manipulation\nof nanoparticles and biomolecules at low photon flux, while femtosecond-laser\noptical tweezers can probe the nonlinear optical properties of the trapped\nspecies with applications in biological diagnostics. In order to adopt\nplasmonic optical tweezers in real-world applications, it is essential to\ndevelop large-scale fabrication processes without compromising the trapping\nefficiency. Here, we develop a novel platform for continuous wave (CW) and\nfemtosecond plasmonic optical tweezers, based on gold-coated black silicon. In\ncontrast with traditional lithographic methods, the fabrication method relies\non simple, single-step, maskless tabletop laser processing of silicon in water\nthat facilitates scalability. Gold-coated black silicon supports repeatable\ntrapping efficiencies comparable to the highest ones reported to date. From a\nmore fundamental aspect, a plasmon-mediated efficiency enhancement is a\nresonant effect, and therefore, dependent on the wavelength of the trapping\nbeam. Surprisingly, a wavelength characterization of plasmon-enhanced trapping\nefficiencies has evaded the literature. Here, we exploit the repeatability of\nthe recorded trapping efficiency, offered by the gold-coated black silicon\nplatform, and perform a wavelength-dependent characterization of the trapping\nprocess, revealing the resonant character of the trapping efficiency maxima.\nGold-coated black silicon is a promising platform for large-scale parallel\ntrapping applications that will broaden the range of optical manipulation in\nnanoengineering, biology, and the study of collective biophotonic effects.\n", "  We report on some implications of the theory of turbulence developed by V.\nYakhot [V. Yakhot, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 57}(2) (1998)]. In particular we focus on\nthe expression for the scaling exponents $\\zeta_{n}$. We show that Yakhot's\nresult contains three well known scaling models as special cases, namely K41,\nK62 and the theory by V. L'vov and I. Procaccia [V. L'vov & I. Procaccia, Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 62}(6) (2000)]. The model furthermore yields a theoretical\njustification for the method of extended self--similarity (ESS).\n", "  Non-cohesive granular media exhibit complex responses to sudden impact that\noften differ from those of ordinary solids and liquids. We investigate how this\nresponse is mediated by the presence of interstitial gas between the grains.\nUsing high-speed x-ray radiography we track the motion of a steel sphere\nthrough the interior of a bed of fine, loose granular material. We find a\ncrossover from nearly incompressible, fluid-like behavior at atmospheric\npressure to a highly compressible, dissipative response once most of the gas is\nevacuated. We discuss these results in light of recent proposals for the drag\nforce in granular media.\n"]}
